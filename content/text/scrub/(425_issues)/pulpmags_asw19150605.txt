  this country recognizes three grades
of truth

      -the truth
      -the whole truth
      -nothing but the truth

  the truth by itself may he false
because of what it leaves unsaid or
because while technically correct it is
designed to mislead

  the whole truth may be inef-
fective because it leaves one asking-
 well what are you going to do about
it

  nothing but the truth involves
a grasp and expression of right funda-
mentals rounded knowledge fair play
-an irresistible appeal

   in chicago from june th to th
there will be a convention of the
associated advertising clubs of the
world the standard under which
this convention assembles is

nothing but the
truth in advertising

   this is not a sentimental standard
it is a commercial standard main-
tained by the contact of idealists en-
thusiasts ami hard heads

   it is the only standard under which
the annual expenditure of 
for advertising can be made to pay
it is the standard under which 
people met last june in toronto and
before that in baltimore dallas
boston

  it is he standard under which

every reader of newspapers maga-
zines outdoor signs booklets novel-
ties-the printed or painted adver-
tising message-has come to believe
what he reads

you are invited to attend

   no adult in this country but uses or is affected by advertising the con-
   vention in chicago will give you ideas for application to your own business
   and your own life you will come in contact with the discoverers and pioneers
   in the development of the economic force of advertising-a force which will grow
   with your support as you will grow by contact with it and its workers

the accident

r ogden blackwell
knew exactly what he was
doing when lie ran his
ninety-horse-power roadster
into the telegraph-pole

  he always knew exactly
what he was doing and why
he was doing it he liked knowing
the reason for things

  all of which proves that the news-
papers that insinuated that he was not
responsible at the time knew nothing
whatever about the adventure young
blackwell himself capitalized the word
when he applied it to the affair

  to him it was an adventure for
of course there was a girl in it and
she was a beauty thats why he ran
the car into the lamp-post

  tie was presented with the alterna-
tive of running into the post or run-
ning into the girl and naturally he
chose the post risking his car and his
own bones without a seconds thought
or hesitation and this in spite of the
fact that it was the girls own fault

she had darted out from the curb

    i	a-s

without warning-being hidden behind
the post until the instant before she
darted there was neither time nor
space to apply brakes so mr black-
well coolly steered the car into the post
smashed one head-light bent one mud-
guard and got a sound jolt against
the steering-wheel himself

  people screamed the policeman
from the corner advanced on a lively
trot and arrived just in time to catch
the beauty who womanlike promptly
fainted when the danger was all over
a crowd gathered about the motor-car
from which young blackwell had de-
scended - to make his way to the
policemans side

   if youll help her into the car he
said  ill get her out of this shes
not hurt just frightened

  the policeman recognized young
blackwell and greeted him

 yes sir he said  that
be best sir

  it was near six oclock and traffic
was heavy he lifted the beauty as
though she were a child and deposited
her beside mr blackwell in the dam-
aged car mr blackwell tooted his
horn-and running slowlv at first-

gradually increasing speed as the
crowd gave way before him-disap-
peared in the direction of the bridge

  he had been headed that way aim-
ing for his father s place on long
island where he was expected to dine
he did not alter his course-not
knowing exactly what destination was
the girls so they ran on for a block
or two in silence a sidc-glance in-
formed him that she was recovering
-that she was quite aware of where
she was and of what had happened
but he did not look at her directly
until she spoke

  if you will set me down she
said at last in a very uncertain voice
 i-think i am-quite myself again

  then he turned and smiled a little
there were still tears on her thick
dark lashes and she was a beauty

   you cant walk on this part of
the bridge he said  ill turn and
take you back where do you want

to go 

   i am sorry ive caused you so
much trouble she said wistfully
 its all my own fault i ought to
have been killed im afraid youve
wrecked your car badly

   not at all he answered
 hardly any in fact

  he had halted and was waiting an
opportunity to swing round

  she shivered a little in spite of her
black furs there was a chill in the
air with the first flurry of snow mr
blackwell regarded her anxiously

   cold  he asked

   a little she answered frankly

  because im tired i think-and-
hungry

  he accomplished the turning-then
pulled up and got out a short robe
which he tucked about her
f don t bother she protested
please if youll just take me as far
as the car-line again i shall be deeply
grateful im delaying you-ive
proved too great an inconvenience al-
ready

  bit she could not help reveling in
the warmth of the fur robe

   it was a tigers pelt beautifully soft
its black and gold suited her strik-
ingly-for she was slim and rather
pallid with great dark eyes and dark
hair just visible beneath her black hat
it was a rather serious face at that
moment

   ill run you home he said
 youre too badlv shaken up to wait
for street-cars to-night

   please dont id really much
rather-  she flushed a little

   its bad enough to think of your
using them every other night he
growled looking down at her

  she stiffened a little sat a little
further from him and remained silent

   what address he asked grimly
as they left the bridge

   east fifty-fourth she said
after biting her lip an instant and
added the number he guided the
car between the elevated posts turned
down-and presently headed west on
fifty-fourth

  it was just growing dark every-
where lights were beginning to
sparkle brightly and as they pro-
gressed-the rattle of wagons the
thunder of the elevated the grinding
rumble of street-cars receded-leav-
ing a certain quiet

  they telt painfully conscious of
each other of tlie unusualness of the
situation and of their silence she
spoke first again

   phe fourth house there on the
other side she said and as he
turned and halted-she threw aside
the robe and stepped down and turn-
ing-faced him

  an arc light on the corner revealed
them to each other he saw that she
was very slender daintily -made a
sort of child-woman-and that she
was very lovely she saw that he was
big and strongly modeled-and she
was glad-because adventures were
rare in her little limited existence-
and to have a heroic-looking man for
the hero of this was good fortune

i hope you will forgive me she
said holding out her hand to him
cinder-eve



 for running in front of your car and
making you wreck it i thought i
could get across safely and the cars
are so slow and that one wasn t very
crowded im sorry-and im very
much obliged for your kindness

good-by

   good-by said mr blackwell
 at least-good-by unless you give
me leave to stop in upon you some
time and convince myself that you
havent suffered any ill effects from
this-and that you are quite all right
she flushed

   but i am all right and i
couldnt think of letting you put your-
self out any further

   but i should enjoy coming i
really should and something unex-
pected may develop

  do you think so really she
gasped  but i wasnt hurt at all
only frightened

  to be quite frank he admitted
 i dont think you will be any the
worse for your experience-but i
should like to come maynt i
they looked into each others eyes
 no said the girl quietly  i
think not

  why he asked astonished

  she was flushed uncomfortable
but determined

   we dont know each other she
said  the fact that i-made you
run into a lamp-post hardly consti-
tutes an introduction

    oh   said he slowly

   and in the ordinary course of
events wed not be likely to meet
you must realize that

    r  dont she smiled a little
 you do but you dont admit it
i am a stenographer-in the offices of
grey  bailey you are ogden
blackwell son of cyrus r black-
well one of our possible presidents
 as though any one cared about
such distinctions he scoffed

   i do i-dont think it-quite
lair to me-to continue our acquaint-
ance

    not fair to you  he repeated

leaning toward her over the wheel
why not

  there is too great a gulf between
us it isnt possible for us to be
friends our-friendship would be
misunderstood and there would be-
gossip-and most disagreeable conse-
quences to me oh there are many
many reasons why-wed best-let it
be good-by mr blackwell im
happy to think you-youd like to be
friendly and now-im cold and im
tired and hungry-and you must be
getting on your wray good-by

  she held out her hand again again
he took it in his

 at least he said  youll tell me
your name i must know how to
think of you and you know mine
 oh you are a sort of celebrity
yes-if you like i am eve neville
 eve   he repeated slowly

  she nodded

   and once i had an ancestress
she added  who was called eve-
and who permitted herself to be
tempted by what she ought never to
have had-and she was punished
and i do not want to suffer and be
punished so i shall be wiser than she
good-by   she turned from him

   but-this- he began

   good-by she said again with an
air of finality and running lightly up
the steps disappeared into the door-
way for an instant he sat still star-
ing after her with a most distressing
sensation of disappointment then
he slowly tooted away but all
through his long ride to his fathers
place he kept thinking of her and
afterward-after he had changed and
had descended to the drawing-room
to be presented to his mothers guests
-and later too when he sat at table
-he was struck by the contrast be-
tween this sort of thing-and the life
miss neville had contrived to sug-
gest to him-by the little that she had
said about herself and her world
surely between them there was a
great gulf fixed but that it was un-
bridgable he seriously doubted


all-story weekly

  for some hours that night after he
had gained the solitude of his own
rooms he sat pondering the question
more than he had ever wanted any-
thing in his life he wanted to know
this girl-to see her frequently-to
explore the secret places behind that
calm white brow and those wide dark
tranquil eyes

  but he was forced to admit to him-
self that there was something behind
what she had said a friendship of
any sort between them was likely to
be misconstrued in the end after
several sleepless hours mr blackwell
decided to abide by her decision and
to forget her as speedily as he could

  whether or not he was simply de-
ceiving himself in this will never be
known he realized that to press his
acquaintance with her would be ta-
king an advantage-and in his code of
honor gentlemen never took unfair
advantage of ladies

  but he did not forget her for
three days he tried-or pretended to
try he went about as usual amusing
himself or trying to amuse himself
it was a sorry business he had long
ago tired of most known forms of
amusement

  then on the fourth day he sent her
some violets and a note he sent them
to the fifty-fourth street house in
her name in the note he said

my dear miss neville

   for the past three clays i have resolutely
attempted to forget all about you and
ignore the fact that you exist feut it is
simply no use i cant help wondering if
you are all right couldnt we be friends
without taking the whole world into our
confidence if you are afraid of gossip
at least maynt i stop in just once to see
you and assure myself that vou are well
and contented be kind frankly the
little time we were together you interested
me very much and i should like to know
you better i should like it more than i
have liked anything in a long time if we
know our friendship is harmless does it
matter about what other evil-minded
people suspect please drop me a line
reversing your decision

   in great anxiety very sincerely yours
   ogden blackwell

  to this upon the following day

came her answer

my deak mr blackwell

  the interest you feel in me is simply the
result of the glamour our foolish little ac-
cident threw about me analyze it your-
self and you will agree with me that it
could be nothing else i am not of your
world we probably have nothing in com-
mon you are a gilded idler i toil

  in the short half-hour we were together
in your car we talked only such common-
places as were suggested by the situation
to be sure i am pretty but the sort of
friendships  care about do not result from
the prettiness of the persons concerned

  thank you very much for your violets
which i have enjoyed you must not send
me any more however and you must not
begin to lay siege it is no use frankly
we cannot be friends  should like to be
but we cannot i know you will be gen-
erous enough to abide by my decision in
this matter and to see the wisdom of it
very sincerely yours

eve neville

  p s-i suffered no inconvenience from
my fright i assure you nothing devel-
oped set your mind at rest

chapter ii

a business transaction

it is the nature of man to desire that
which is denied him in justice to
blackwell it is necessary to admit
that he would probably have been keen
about continuing his acquaintance with
eve even if she had not held him off

  but he was the more keen for the
obstacles she threw in his way it be-
came little less than an obsession with
him to overcome her objections and
overtake her he set his wits to work
to contrive this-and being a clever
young man when he bothered to be he
evolved a scheme that promised some-
thing it was revealed to the lady in
his answering letter

my dear miss neville

  in justice to myself i really cant per-
mit you to underestimate me and to hold
such an erroneous view of the situation
existing between us it is not because you
are pretty that i desired to continue your
cinder-eve



acquaintance in our conversation the
other day it seemed to me that a sort of
harmony existed between us placing us in
accord and when - added to this - you
mentioned that you are a stenographer i
was seized with an inspiration let me
explain-in absolute confidence if you
please

  to begin with i am not the idler you-
and the rest of the world for that matter
-suppose  i am a very busy man for
some time i have been engaged in the
writing of a novel and try as i may it
has seemed impossible to get hold of a
stenographer who will take dictation from
me without interrupting or breaking my
train of thought or offering suggestions
or precipitating her own personality into
my work t was at my wits end when the
accident happened i had just discharged
my eleventh stenographer for foolish gig-
gling  it struck me as-possibly-the in-
tervention of providence when you in-
formed me so casually that you are a
stenographer now the secret is out you
see i had in mind to offer you a position
which would be better than the one you are
at present holding - providing of course
you proved - on better acquaintance - as
much in accord with me as i thought you
would

  now may i come to see you about this
the book really must be completed i want
your answer with impatience

very sincerely yours

ogden black welt

  at first he had thought of engaging
in some sort of imaginary business
but he soon abandoned that idea re-
alizing that the invention of business
letters eternally would lead him into
difficulties besides the letters would
have to be mailed-and of course that
wasnt possible theyd all be coming
back from their bogus addresses by
way of the dead-letter office

  the next thing that occurred to him
was being an author lie knew abso-
lutely nothing about being an author
but he thought it would not be a diffi-
cult task to pretend to be one he
assumed that every author is different
from every other one in his methods
of work and so on

  every way he considered the matter
an author was the easiest thing he
could be-requiring the services of a
stenographer he was determined to
batter down the barriers between them

-by fair means or foul if she wfculd
not be friends with him she should be
his stenographer and the world could
find nothing to object to in that-and
tc gossip about all men had stenog-
raphers

  however miss neville was not
quite so gullible as he hoped she would
be she answered simply

    its no use

  and signed the letter-if you could
call it a letter- e neville

  in great indignation then that very
evening mr blackwell called

  miss neville resided in a very old-
fashioned apartment house it was
four stories high and she lived in the
top apartment finding the name on
the bell in the vestibule mr black-
well rang-and when the ticking at
the door notified him he admitted him-
self and climbed the stairs

  she came to the upper door herself
so she could not deny him before
she had recovered from her astonish-
ment he was stalking past her into the
drawing-room-and there was nothing
for her to do but meekly follow

   i have come he announced firm-
ly  to find out why you cast such an
insinuation at me have i deserved
that you think me a falsifier

  miss neville smiled a little reveal-
ing two very notable dimples and
when she smiled she was really irre-
sistible

   im sorry if i offended you she
said contritely  but your explana-
tion was so remarkable

  he glared and scowled

   is it so remarkable that i am
writing a book does it seem so un-
likely do i appear an utter im-
becile  

   oh no replied miss neville
hastily  but you dont seem at all the
sort of person who writes books and
i-id never heard that you were en-
gaged that way and- well it all
seemed so unlikely

   thats hardly grounds for insinu-
ating that i am inventing reasons for
knowing you  said he indignantly


all-story weekly

  she flushed

   you should have mentioned it
when we first met-and you shouldnt
have sent me flowers that led me off
on the wrong trail you see wont you

sit down

  they had been standing facing
each other under the central chan-
delier-blackwell in evening clothes a
white gardenia in his buttonhole his
gloves still on his topcoat open his
hat and stick in his hands miss ne-
ville was in a simple house-gown of
some soft pale pink stuff and she
held a book-her linger marking the
place

   thank you said he seating him-
self a little stiffly on a fat green-plush
chair

   youd better lay aside your
things she added smiling  i sup-
pose i must he polite now so long as
you are here

  pie rose angrily

  ill go if you prefer he said

   not at all i told you i should like
to be friends with you its only other
people standing in the way ive so
much to contend with as it is i didnt
fancy complicating things any more

  she was taking his hat and stick
he threw off his topcoat and began
to draw off his gloves

   how much do you get at grey 
baileys he asked youll pardon
the question if i seem to be taking a
liberty i ask for business reasons
purely

   t quite understand she answered
slowly  t am paid eighteen dollars
a week

  he looked horrified

   eighteen and what are the
hours 

  he gasped in indignation

   eight-thirty to five

   thats criminal  he cried  its
atrocious i will pay you thirty-five a
week and you need work only morn-
ings

  she stared and then laughed a little
and shook her head at him

   dont you see  she said  you

make it so hard for me to believe

vou

 why

   its too much money for such
short hours you could get the most
experienced stenographer for less than
that

   but i refuse to pay wages that
will torment my conscience besides
im very trying im difficult to get
on with when im in the throes of

composition youve no idea

  she opened wide eyes and consid-
ered him thoughtfully

   did you pay your last stenog-
rapher this rate 

   i pay all mv stenographers at this
rate

   and still you find it hard to get

suited  

   almost impossible their-their
personalities annoy me i have very
bad luck perhaps you think me less
susceptible to insignificant details than
i am i have a sensitive nature

  she smiled

   i might prove equallv undesira-
ble

   i am sure you wouldnt i was
sure of it the instant i saw you i said
to myself-or rather thought- here
is the verv girl for you here is
the one youve been looking for at
last 

   meaning stenographer of course
said miss neville flushing

   of course cried mr blackwell
innocently

  she reflected toying with the book
iri her lap absently

   of what would mv duties con-
sist 

   taking dictation chiefly i dic-
tate the book you take it down in
shorthand and type it later then you
return the sheets to me for revision
and correction i can work only in
the mornings i work very slowly
some days i cannot work at all these
days ou will have free

    are there letters too and so on  

   almost never i attend to all that
myself
rinder-eve



   but it sounds ridiculously simple
you would like to try it then
said mr blackwell eagerly

  she hesitated

   or do you still doubt me and
my reasons for persisting in knowing

you  

   n-no-but grey  bailey have
been very good to me in a way i
dislike leaving them and  may not
give yon satisfaction ive a certain
position now and a certain fixed in-
come thats an advantage you see-
especially when one is the man of the
family as i am this household rests
chiefly on my shoulders

  thats rather a burden isnt it
he said and it seemed to him almost
a sacrilege but he carefully kept his
feelings to himself  how many do
you support on this eighteen dollars a
week may i ask 

   my mother and my sister shes
still at school

   three it seems incredible i
should think the increase i offer you
would be a great advantage

   it would be

  he leaned toward her

   suppose we agree that the ar-
rangement is to last a definite number
of weeks would that insure you
against risk and id agree to give
you-say a months notice if your
services should prove unsuitable but
of course i know they will not

  she lay back in her chair studying
him

   what is the name of your book 
she asked

  under her curious eyes his glance
rested upon the carpet he had not
thought out a name on the spur of
the moment he seized upon the first
suggestion that came to him the
carpet was of pale green with pale pink
roses on it and yellow butterflies

  butterflies he said raising his
eyes calmly

   butterflies  she repeated curious-
ly  it sounds very attractive but not
at all unusual

   its rather difficult to get an un-

usual title nowadays said he every-
things been chosen oh ive not really
settled upon  butterflies  definitely
if i think of a better title as the story
progresses of course ill choose it

   i see is much of your story
written 

   about one-fourth he replied at
random  but ive been thinking of
doing even that over-and of making
some improvements

   tell me the plot said miss ne-
ville leaning back in her chair and
clasping her hands behind her head
her eyes were alight with eager in-
terest her red lips fell a bit apart
there was a tinge of color in her
cheeks she looked very lovely-and
mr blackwell found some difficulty in
keeping his head

   i shouldnt think of it he said
 youd be horribly bored

   nonsense i should be interested
 anyway i tell things badly id
much rather have you wait and find
out as we go along

   as a matter of fact he couldnt have
invented a plot to save his life

  but just the general theme she
suggested wistfully  tust in a word
or two you can outline the idea of
it cant you 

   i could he said  of course
but- well what should you think
the theme would be  

    its not about real butterflies of
course she said meditatively

   of course not

   you said a novel

    ye-es

   so it must be a story is it about
gay idlers - butterfly people thats
it youd know a lot about that sort
of thing

she beamed at her own perspicacity
 i dont know why you persist in
calling me an idler in a tone that makes
it an insult especially now when ive
told you my secret about the book

    i didnt mean that you are an idler
i meant that you were born into that
set you know was i right about the
general idea of your story


all-story weekly

    yes its a society story

    a love-story 

   of course

   he was very emphatic about it

    fancy your being able to write
 love-stories she cried vvonderingly
  you dont look at all like it are
 you writing from experience or from
 observation and imagination

    a little of each said he wisely
  but i say havent we talked quite
 enough about me 

  have i been rude and curious
 she asked flushing  im sorry i
 didnt mean to be but i suppose you
 do dislike talking shop most of us
 do

    im lots more interested in other
 things he admitted

    not really more than in your own
 work  

   u we-ell n-no but-

   i understand you get so much
 of it during business hours

    exactly

    i should have known that said
 she but you see ive aspirations to
 write myself and thats why i was
 interested

    not really  he cried

   she nodded proudly

    but we wont talk about it she
 said  what shall we talk about 

    lets talk about you he sug-
 gested pleasantly

   she smiled and shook her head

    theres nothing about me to talk
 of nothing interesting

    everything about you would in-
 terest me im sure said he

   she opened her eyes

    why should it 

  because i - im interested in
 studying people-types-for my book
 you know everybody interests me

   i see-in a purelv professional
 wav

    ve-es
 lnt l dont think i fancy being put
 under your microscope

    youve nothing to fear surelv
 said he

   o think she murmured irrele-

 vantly  how mistaken people are
 about you they think you a useless
 spoiled overrich and pampered idler
 of fashion-a sort of beau brummel
 -and all the time you are devoting
 yourself to writing this book and
 studying people to put into it its a
 sort of game with you isnt it you
 can find out more about people by pre-
 tending youve no reason for wanting
 to know and that you dont care
 whether you know or not you must
 be awfully clever

   he wasnt quite sure whether she
 had seen through him and was amus-
 ing herself with him-or whether she
 had believed all of his fabrications

    do people think such uncompli-
 mentary things about me he asked
 curiously

    you know they do i dare say
 you help to create the impression

     id no idea they thought about me

 	at all

   of course they do-especially just
 now when your father is in the public
 eye as a political possibility

     its a disadvantage having a cele-
 brated father

    and a wealthy one too she
 added thoughtfully

    what makes you ay that

    its seldom the son of a moneyed
 man has any ambition to distinguish
 himself hes usually contented to
 spend his fathers acquisitions 

     i suppose thats true

    thats why i admire you said
 she and then stopped suddenly re-
 alizing that she had said more than she
 intended and flushing crimson he
 regarded her fascinated

     thank you he said slowly  its
 bully of you to say it anyway

    he was sure that she had been teach-
 ing him a lesson nd in some hu-
 mility and discomfort and embarrass-
 ment be rose

    not going he cried sweetly

     yes i think i must

    but you must meet rav mother
 first

   she moved to the portieres at the
cinder-eve



 door and turning nodded slightly as
 for pardon and left him alone he
 struggled into his topcoat and began to
 draw on one glove before he had got
 it fastened miss neville returned fol-
 lowed by a small robust cheerful-
 looking little woman dressed in black
 she had white hair dressed with jet
 combs and white collar and cuffs

  mr blackwell she said cor-
dially  eve has spoken of you im
very glad to know you wont you
have some fruit before you go
eve

   no thanks said he  really-
not i dined late

   some cocoa then its cold out-
side some cookies

   another time gladly said he
 im really not able to do justice to
them now

   dont be bashful she said with
twinkling eyes  but i take it you
are not very well another time
we shall hope to see you soon again
mr blackwell

   thank you said blackwell
 good night 

  mrs neville departed blackwell
took up his hat and stick and preceded
eve to the door

   good night he said

   good night said eve

  they shook hands

   when do i report for duty  she
asked then

  he was startled incredulous he
stared searchingly into her eyes there
was no mockery there no mischief no
scorn she had evidently taken him
seriously after all she had not
pointed a moral

  how soon can you come he
asked  i should like to get on as
soon as possible

  the day after to-morrow she
suggested

   splendid

   and where do i report

   at my fathers house-up the
avenue i have a sort of study there
she nodded

  and the time

    nine

    i shall be there said eve simply

  blackwell descended the four
flights of stairs in astounding good
humor and that night he could
hardly sleep for delight at the success
of his scheme

chapter iii

troubles of another

however the most serious
drawback now confronted him
he had got a stenographer who
believed him to be an author-and he
could not even compose a good letter
if he would keep her deceived he must
speedily develop the ability to reel off
endless literary matter-and this ne-
cessitated the memorizing of pages
and pages of somebody elses crea-
tions

   he would have to spend his nights
in study in order to keep up the de-
ception-or so he thought at first
he went to the nearest public library
and asked a good-natured librarian
for the most unpopular but interesting
book of fiction she had stipulating
that it must chronicle the doings of
ultra-smart society

   she was so used to supplying un-
usual demands that she expressed no
wonder or curiosity at this one but
simply classified-mr blackwell men-
tally as a  freak the book that
was forthcoming was an old english
novel in six thick volumes written
by a lady named ann de ortha and
called the mistress of the manse
mr blackwell had never heard of it
in his life and after reading a few
pages here and there he fancied that
very few others of his generation had

   proudly he bore his treasure home
and set about memorizing enough to
form the first days work with eve
but he had flattered himself it was
easier to plan memorizing it than
actually to memorize it after two
solid hours he called a halt and sought
some means of escape from so much


all-story weekly

needless labor and he who seeks

shall find	

  mr blackwell-possessing himselt
of bis fathers study-arranged it
after a manner of his own in prepa-
ration for the morrows toil since
the rest of the family was still at the
long island place and only the ser-
vants were about there was no one
to question him

  upon the following morning miss
neville presented herself precisely at
nine and was ushered by the footman
into the study there mr blackwell
greeted her

  he wore a lounge-coat of blue vel-
vet especially purchased for its ar-
tistic air his dark hair was tousled
just enough to make it look careless
he desired to create the impression
that already his mind was busy and
that hair was too insignificant to in-
terest him in his dark blue eyes
dwelt a serious and soulful look

   have you breakfasted  he asked
as miss neville removed her small
plain businesslike hat before the mir-
ror patted her hair into order and
produced her pencils and a note-book

   certainly said she somewhat
astonished  does your stenographer
usually breakfast with yon

   sometimes said he  but since
you have breakfasted perhaps wed
better get to work at once i want to
accomplish a great deal to-day i
feel that i can accomplish a great deal
we are going to begin at the begin-
ning again

  she took her place at the side of
his desk ready to take dictation

  mr blackwell rose and moved
toward a screen that stood in one cor-
ner by a window

   i always dictate from behind
this he said  t get self-conscious
and nervous when i can see the sten-
ographer i feel so foolish saving
things that look all right written
and her eyes always bore through me
if i pause a moment to think back
here i can pretend that i am alone in
the room

  he looked at her anxiously to see
if she was crediting him she seemed
to be he departed behind the screen

  can you hear me distinctly he
asked seating himself in a comfort-
able chair arranged for him before-
hand and letting his eyes wander ap-
provingly over a smoking stand a pile
of cigars and cigarettes a cellaret
supplied with liquid refreshment and
a low stand on which the four vol-
umes of  the mistress of the
manse  reposed the first volume
was open at the first page he seated
himself comfortably drew the volume
toward him lighted a cigar

   i hear you perfectly said miss
neville

  he glanced at her suspiciously
through the peep-hole in the screen
she was bent over her note-book in
an attitude of deep attention he
paused an instant admiring her
then he began

   butterflies a four-part novel by
ogden blackwell

  he waited

   yes said miss neville

   it was a clear cold starlit night
in early november he began he
read in a pleasant voice glancing up
as often as possible to watch her
through the screen  lady merri-
man emerged from her coach- and
so on dictating word for word as it
was written but halting now and then
dramatically as though to think of
what he wanted to say next as he
read miss neville took it all down in
shorthand and with endless satis-
faction he observed that she seemed
surprised and pleased with his humble
attempts at literature

  as a matter of fact mistress ann
de ortha had not an uninteresting
style and her tale-if somewhat sen-
sational for these realistic times-
was not in the least dull mr black-
well brought it up to date he skipped
the long descriptions in which she
seemed to revel and substituted auto-
mobiles and private yachts for coaches
and riding parties it was amusing to
cinder-eve



see what he really could do with it
but it was in the love scenes he really
scintillated

  he gave them with such force and
fervor and fire and emphasis that
miss neville was forced to marvel-
and in the end-when he suddenly
called a halt remembering that her
fingers would be getting tired holding
the pencil-she congratulated him
warmly

  are we through for the day
she asked in some astonishment as he
came from behind the screen running
his fingers through his hair in a truly
literary fashion and wishing that it
was longer

   indeed we are he said  how
long do you suppose i can sit in there
at a time reading that stuff

   reading it she repeated

  he caught himself up

   from my notes of course you
didnt suppose i was really composing
then dear me no he shook his
head in gentle negation  im refin-
ing it-polishing-improving if you
notice any inconsistencies as we go
on dont fail to call my attention
 ill not replied miss neville
putting aside her note-book and pen-
cils  and when do i type this
now 

   have you much   he asked

   enough to fill twenty pages
typed i should say

   how long will that take you 
she glanced critically through her
notes

   three or four hours perhaps

   youd better do that to-morrow
morning then well go on that plan
one morning well dictate and on the
next one type and correct

but weve the afternoons

   i never work in the afternoons
said he  t dont believe in overdo-
ing anything you can do better if
you go at it fresh every time besides
in the afternoons i go about to-to
places that i am going to put into
the story and get-well what we writ-
ers call local color -and take notes

and so on this afternoon for in-
stance we are going to motor to a
very charming inn out the road and
take tea and watch them play winter
polo

 we  cried miss neville staring
 to be sure i-i shall want you
to-take notes and remember things
for me i-ive a rotten memory
 oh she said slowly  then i
do work afternoons

  didnt i explain about that he
cried astonished  i thought you
understood of course it isnt ex-
actly work because it is entertain-
ment too in a way-and all that
but i shall require your presence
every afternoon and many evenings
evenings she repeated rising
and regarding him thought fully

   well-there are theaters you
know-and opera-and the gay
cafes mistress evelyn and the lady
esmerelda merriman drift through
all the popular gaieties

  miss neville considered him her
pencil pressed against her full red
lips her dark eyes grave

   let us understand this she said
 my time is going to be all taken up
-instead of just the mornings as you
led me to believe

  did i he cried contritely

   you did

   well well he exclaimed un-
easily  i-im more than sorry i
-im afraid ive not a very good
business head it was carelessness
i-suppose we raise the salary then
to compensate

   give me more than thirty-five
 if you accepted thirty-five thinking
that you would be required only in the
mornings and i am going to need you
afternoons and evenings too i think
a hundred is not too much

  she laughed

   you arent much of a business
man she admitted  a hundred a
week for an ordinary stenographer
who has never gotten more than eigh-
teen	

am i to blame if people havent


all-story weekly

appreciated you he cried im-
patiently  you are not an ordinary
stenographer you are a very extra-
ordinary stenographer you are the
most extraordinary stenographer i
have ever employed

  which was quite true

   in what way am i so extraor-
dinary  she asked artlessly

   you sit still you dont fidget
you dont giggle you dont inter-
rupt sniffle cough nor sneeze

  that wasnt at all what he meant
but it was what he said-warned by
her suspicious eyes

   its going to cause comment
when im seen about with you she
said slowly  youre so well known
-and i-ive hardly any clothes that
are suitable to-going about

   an additional reason why you
should have an additional salary you
wouldnt have required the clothes i
take it it i hadnt insisted upon tak-
ing you about

  she flushed

   i think i shall have to have my
mother too it is only fair to me

   do you really think so  he
asked regretfully

   most people like my mother and
are honored to know her and to be
with her said miss neville  she
was a hampton of south carolina
 dear me said he you misun-
derstand me dont do it i detest
people who misunderstand me i sim-
ply thought it would all bore your
mother and tire her out-and i
thought-well-somehow-the pres-
ence of other people always makes me
more or less self-con sc iots and unable
to work well but of course if you
cant go about without your mother
we will have her by all means

   ill think it over said miss
neville  i shouldnt like to inter-
fere with your work

  there came a knock at the door
timmons the aged blackwell butler
responded to blackwells  come
luncheon is served if you
please sir he said

   well be down directly said
blackwell nodding timmons de-
parted miss neville stared

   i am lunching here  she asked
 surely it would be absurd for
you to go away to lunch when we are
going out immediately afterward

   i see she cried nodding i
told my mother i would be back and
she-we have no telephone-and shes
apt to worry naturally the thought
that i-am compelled to-go to mens
offices and rooms worries her a lit-
tle she doesnt seem to realize how
well able i am to take care of my-
self

   we can stop there and relieve
her anxiety on our way to the inn
said he shall we go down now
they went-miss neville observ-
ing the hallway and dining-room with
approving eyes

   do you often have to go to mens
rooms he asked as they seated
themselves opposite each other at the
small oval table

   ive had to do it only once before
-when mr grey was ill but of
course his wife was there and so on
it wasnt difficult at all it was very
hard to come here to-day though
she confessed this with a faint flush
and a timid smile

  not really he asked troubled
 i didnt know you you see-and
-you acted-at first-at least i got
the impression that-you admired me
but t had to trust you your offer
was simply too glorious to refuse-
with the youngster coming on to need
winter things-and thinking of board-
ing school too and everything thir-
ty-five dollars a week seemed like a
fortune after eighteen

   but its a hundred now-not
thirty-five

  nonsense she cried her dark
eyes widening her color deeiening
i couldnt take so much

   but think of the time you will be
spending 

   amusing myself it isnt such a
fearful fate
cinder-eve



   and the clothes you will require
 that is a consideration she ad-
mitted  i shouldnt like you to feel
uncomfortable on my account

   a hundred a week it is then
said he  thats agreed

  of course i do believe all you
have told me now she said slowly
 and i suppose you are satisfied that
you are making a good bargain but
its wonderful luck for me that i ran
in front of vour car heaven knows
how much longer i should have been
tied down to that eighteen dollars a
week and the sort of life my income
necessitated-no fun-no larks-no
-or at least-very few good times
 please dont said mr black-
well wistfully

   dont what

   dont remind me of all that  i
cant bear to think of it

  why she asked mildly

   its such a beastly world he an-
nounced disgustedly  some have
too much and the rest hardly any at
all ive had more than enough to-
to share

  she sighed

   i suppose theres a reason for it
or it wouldnt be she said philo-
sophically  only-were all too lit-
tle to see the reason

  how old are you asked mr
blackwell curiousty

  twenty said eve

   you dont look it-not by a good
deal

  really i feel hideously old-or
t did i should say of course my
new salary rejuvenates me well not
have to stint much now i suppose
youve no idea what stinting means
 we-ell no he admitted
gravely

   its not at all pleasant she told
him  i-i am infinitely grateful to
you for putting an end to it can i
say that to you without your misun-
derstanding 

   you can say anything to me with-
out my misunderstanding said
young blackwell

   she nodded slowly

   i think that is so you have a
sort of understanding look i noticed
in your book too your knowledge of
character-drawing seems to be excel-
lent-and you go into great details in
description you must be very ob-
servant

   i am he acknowledged non-
chalantly

   she buttered a bit of toast and pop-
ped it into her red mouth he stared
-fascinated-wishing that she would
do it agaiu

   what do you think of the book
as far as weve gone he asked
frankly now

    i like it its not at all what i
expected though youre so big and
strong and vital-looking your style
has a-well a soft touch i hadnt an-
ticipated

    oh said he

    generally it seems to be a lot like
walpoles  castle of otranto  and that
school i suppose youve read them 

   cant say i have answered
blackwell

   youd find them entertaining
said she  and instructive too
nothing is more instructive than a
wide knowledge of books

  that afternoon they motored out
the road to see the winter polo-miss
neville changing to her very best
clothes when they stopped to notify
mrs neville about her additional
hours they dined at the inn after-
ward and motored back to town to
see a show

  then they had supper-and a very
weary though very happy eve it
was who combed her long dark hair
before her mothers dressing table-
as she reported the days doings and
yet it was not a sleepy creature who
reported the next day at nine youth
doesnt require so very much sleep
and after her years of f stinting  the
plunge of gaiety brought all that was
lresh and joyous and young in eve
to the surface


  she was a girl after all if she had
borne a mans burdens for three long
vear mr blackwell had toiled for
an hour or two in the night planning
the portion of the story to be dictated
next day and deciding how it could tie

altered	

  accordingly his heroine mistress

evelyn pomphrey niece of lady
merriman announced her intention
of visiting the shops-prior to a visit
to the states-and blackwell in-
formed his stenographer that he knew
nothing of shopping and must learn

  so  that second afternoon they
shopped miss neville bought clothes
-at first demurring-objecting-ar-
guing-but eventually giving in
when it was agreed that the sum total
of her purchases should he subtracted
from her weekly wage

  mr blackwell had the most excit-
ing time of his young career selecting
things for her for she was slender
and graceful and lovely-and there
was nothing she couldnt wear her
hair and eyes were dark her skin fair
-and already beginning to lose that
colorlessness that he had marked the
day of the accident the cold air
may have whipped a tinge of color
into her cheeks or the fact that the
salespersons exchanged significant
glances over them may have had
something to do with it at any rate
they chose hats-a black and white
fur one-and an a -brown one with
burnt-orange plumage and a dark
blue one of unspeakable chic and
hair ornaments of maline-and-gold
embroidery and aigrets and an
evening wrap of black velvet and
white fur and another of royal pur-
ple velvet and white fur and another
all white and four evening gowns-
a white one a pale yellow one a pale
pink one and a pale blue one-with
slippers and stockings and gloves to
match-handkerchiefs blouses a suit
or two-a heavy fur coat for motor-
ing with a toque to match and neces-
sary odds and ends of jeweled knick-
knacks

  shopping to a woman is like some
intoxicating wine of marvelous
bouquet-and like some irresistible
poison the firmest will falters

  so despite miss nevilles initial
struggles to oppose him he persisted
-ordering one thing after another-
until her heart sank at the thought of
the money they had spent-and she
dreaded to estimate how many years
she would have to continue as his
stenographer in rder to liquidate her
debts but he shrugged when she
mentioned this and remarked that she
required the clothes in order to fulfil
her duties and this was unanswer-
able

  that night he agreed to her sug-
gestion that she remain at home to
try on her new clothes and dispose of
them to advantage the thought of
losing her even for that once was al-
most unendurable hut he yielded re-
luctantly and spent the time at a din-
ner-dance given by his sister where
he regarded all the ladies in attend-
ance and made ungallant remarks to
himself about them comparing them
much to their disadvantage with
some one that he knew

  and he got away early-realizing
that he preferred the mere thought
of her to the living presence of these
other women-and back he went to
his rooms to sit and smoke in the li-
brary over  mistress of the manse
and plan the chapter for next day
at last he went to bed determined to
dream of her and was very much an-
noyed upon awakening the next
morning to find he had not done so

  miss neville meanwhile had been
like a youngster again-trying on all
the newr garments before her mirror-
while her mother and frankie looked
on and marvelled and applauded

  it was their firm and fixed belief
that eve was the most beautiful per-
son in the world any way and that
now with these clothes for a setting
others would begin to realize it and
eve was forced to admit to herself
that she was not exactly plain after-
cinder-eve



ward frankie had been permitted to
pin up her curls and try on the finery
-her airs and graces sending mrs
neville and eve into peals of laugh-
ter altogether the top-floor flat
at number-something-or-other fifty-
fourth street resounded with more
merriment than it had seen this many
a da eve staring at the stars later
on her cheek pillowed on her arm
decided that it was not such a very
bad world after all

chapter iv

smoothing a few wrinkles

mr blackwell had been seen
about with a beautiful young
and unknown lady for no more
than a week when word of his proba-
ble entanglement was whispered into
the ear of cyrus r and that gentle-
man abandoned his business affairs
and political meetings postponed his
appointments and came up to town in
haste to look into the matter

  arriving at the door of the study
one morning somewhere about eleven
having been guided that far somewhat
reluctantly by timmons he was
amazed to hear in his sons voice

   for years ive loved you madly
evelyn the first time i saw you i
adored you i have never ceased
adoring you

  to say that mr blackwell was
startled is to undershoot the mark by
a great deal he was far from ex-
pecting to find the object of his dis-
pleasure here within his very study-
but he rejoiced to realize that he had
arrived at such an opportune moment
let some definite understanding be
arrived at before he could interfere
he opened the door without knocking

  to his astonishment there was no
sign of ogden but at his own desk sat
an exceedingly attractive dark-haired
young woman writing in a thick note-
book

  she glanced up in some surprise at
the sound of the opening door and

surveyed cyrus r without enthusiasm
at the same instant while cyrus r
and the strange young woman were
taking account of each other young
ogden blackwells voice sounded
again his father now discovered that
il emerged from behind the screen

   what care i for the difference in
our rank ogden was crying val-
iantly  love cannot be governed by
such a small thing as earthly rank

  cyrus r nodded slightly to the
young woman at the desk entered
closed the door behind him and ad-
vanced

  at the same instant there came an
exclamation from behind the screen
and young blackwell appeared rather
flushed astonished and somewhat em-
barrassed his fathers eyes rested
wonderingly upon tousled hair blue
velvet lounging jacket-and the pencil
thrust behind ogdens ear

   i beg pardon said cyrus dryly
removing his glasses and polishing
them  i trust i am not intruding

   n-not at all father said ogden
 my father-my new stenographer-
miss neville would you mind wait-
ing in the music-room miss neville
please 

  ogden advanced as he made the ap-
peal eve rose instantly and went out
father and son were left alone to-
gether-but not exactly face to face
for ogden was busy selecting and
lighting a cigarette

   did i understand you to sav-
stenographer ogdenasked cyrus
r curiously

   yes-stenographer said ogden
nodding and lie blew out a puff of
smoke  anything wrong at wood-
lands  

   no said cyrus r  everything
is moving nicely at woodlands but
grace has written me that no such de-
sirable state of affairs exists here
hence my visit

  he sat down in the nearest arm-
chair crossed his legs fitted his finger-
tips together and regarded his son
from under bushy grizzled eyebrows


all-story weekly

he was a remarkable looking man
this cyrus r blackwell nominee lor
governor of the state and the very
probable next president

  an aristocrat through and through
-descended of aristocrats-yet a dip-
lomat and a statesman-and therefore
democratic he had amassed his huge
fortune without relinquishing his claim
to honesty and uprightness now hav-
ing won wealth he was preparing to

achieve glory

  he wore the conventional frock-
coat and soft black felt hat the old-
fashioned standing collar and black tie
that had distinguished him when he
served his term in congress his hair
was gray - his eyes too and he
adopted the flowing mustache and
goatee of the south from whence he
had come

   i see said ogden  and what
if troubling grace 

   you are troubling grace an-
swered his father mildly  it appears
that you have gotten yourself en-
tangled some way-or at least you
have been seen about rather frequently
with some one grace doesnt know
and she is a little worried

   i see said ogden smiling

   no doubt assented his father
 well what have you to say about
it 

   grace is right of course the
younger man replied  fve been
about with miss neville

   your-eh-stenographer 

  he smiled a little over the word

   exactly also i have to say that
i am intending to marry miss neville
-as soon as ive persuaded her to
accept me

   indeed said cyrus r curiously
 this is news 

  ogden seated himself opposite his
father and waited

   who is miss neville if i may ask
-besides being your stenographer
asked cyrus r finally seeing that he
would have to break the silence

   nobody that you know-or that
any of us know iler father was a

lawyer in the middle west her
mother was a hampton of south
carolina she was in school until her
father died-three years ago then
she studied typing and stepped into
her fathers shoes as man-of-the-
family

    i see  - laconically  and for
how long have you been assisting her
in this respect

  he glanced about the room

  about a week said ogden
swiftly he explained the circumstances
of his meeting with eve her attitude
toward him and the means he devised
for continuing her acquaintance

   dear me said cyrils r at the
end of the recital  now i begin to
understand the - the impassioned
love utterances that i overheard from
the hallway were merely cribbed from
this book you are supposed to be
writing 

   exactly

  cyrus blackwell smiled

   a very ingenious arrangement
he admitted  a very pretty girl too
but of course the idea of your marry-
ing her my boy is quite out of the
question

  ogden rose in some excitement

   and why so he demanded

   because she is not of your station
in life marriages of persons in dif-
ferent stations almost never end hap-
pily and i want your marriage to
end happily

   what have stations to do with
it cried ogden disgustedly

   they determine ones view-point
-ones tastes preferences habits
ideas-ones attitude toward life all
these things are of inestimable im-
portance

 rot said ogden the only
thing that counts is-if two people
care for each other-care enough to go
through with it make the necessary
sacrifices put up with the necessary
inconveniences

  cyrus r shook his head

   i expect to be the next governor
of new york state ogden-and then
cinder-eve



president of the united states i think

you are overlooking that 

   i dont see what that has to do
with my marrying  cried ogden
opening his eyes

   i had planned a more ambitious
marriage for you

   i am not seeking to further my
ambitions - or yours - in my mar-
riage said ogden  im intending
to gain my own happiness

   but not at the expense of mine
your mothers and graces

   no nor will i expect them to
interfere with me how can my mar-
riage to eve prevent your election 
cyrus r smiled

   i didnt intend to insinuate that it
can but by allying ourselves in this
fashion we lose prestige i must urge
you my boy to think twice before you
do this thing

   i have no need to think any more
said ogden  ive decided

   has it occurred to you that all of
your income is derived from me 
ogden flushed

   not all of it he said  i have
something from grandmother but if
it zvcrc all from you-and you were to
cut me off-do you suppose that would
compel me to change my mind do
you suppose im that worthless
cyrus r smiled gently

   i dont suppose you are worthless
at all i am assuming that you are
sensible

   i dare say i can work at some-
thing said ogden  ive intelligence
and strength and other men seem to
be able to get on-men infinitely less
equipped than i am

  cyrus r stared

   youd actually displease me de-
prive yourself of your income and go
out and work for this girl

   i would said ogden decidedly

   you must be in love with her

  i am said ogden flushing

  a little silence fell between them
blackwell sr rose and stood con-
sidering his son thoughtfully

   in three days lie said  we are

    	a-s

closing woodlands and are coming
back to town i shall expect you to
give me your final decision then 

   whenever you like said ogden

   have you the least idea what you
could do-what it would be like to
earn your own living what you would
be worth to any one   asked his
father smiling gently

  no-but it can do no harm to find
out im beginning to tiiink i might
be a lot better off if i had to struggle
for myself

  humph said his father slowly
 well youll be given the opportunity
if you persist in this nonsense 

   he put on his hat

    until thursday then he said
ogden nodded and cyrus r black-
well passed out

  yroung blackwell waited until he
heard the front door close then he
started toward the music - room -but
-miss neville met him half-way they
came face to face on the stairs and
stopped-regarding each other

    i heard the door close said eve
 i thought youd be wanting me
again

   i was just coming for you he
answered his eyes were searching
her face intently

    wrhat is it  she asked  is any-
thing wrong 

  he nodded

    my father has just notified me of
his intention to cut off my allowance
she opened wide eves

   why  

    because he thinks i mean to marry
you

   what-at  she gasped  why-
how absurd how can he think such
a thing

  she was flushed breathless wide-
eved

  i told him

    you told him  

  young blackwell nodded

    oh his curiosity was aroused he
had heard wed been going about a lot
together he was anxious so i-i
told him that i meant to marrv you


all-story weekly

he was a remarkable looking man
this cyrus r blackwell nominee for
governor of the state and the very
probable next president

  an aristocrat through and through
-descended of aristocrats-yet a dip-
lomat and a statesman-and therefore
democratic he had amassed ins huge
fortune without relinquishing his claim
to honestv and uprightness now hav-
ing won wealth he was preparing to

achieve glorv	   

  he wore the conventional frock-
coat and soit black felt hat the old-
fashioned standing collar and black tie
that had distinguished him when he
served his term in congress his hair
was gray - his eyes too and he
adopted the flowing mustache and
goatee of the south from whence he

had come

   i see said ogden  and what

i troubling grace 

   you are troubling grace an-
swered his father mildly  it appears
that you have gotten yourself en-
tangled some way-or at least you
have been seen about rather frequently
with some one grace doesnt know
and she is a little worried

   i see said ogden smiling

   no doubt assented his father
 well what have you to say about
it

   grace is right of course the
younger man replied  ive been
about with miss neville

   your-eh-stenographer 

  he smiled a little over the word

   exactly also i have to say that
t am intending to marry miss neville
-as soon as ive persuaded her to
accept me

   indeed said cyrus r curiously
 this is news 

  ogden seated himself opposite his
father and waited

   who is miss neville if i may ask
-besides being your stenographer  
asked cyrus r finally seeing that he
would have to break the silence

   nobody that you know-or that
any of us know her father was a

lawyer in the middle west her
mother was a hampton of south
carolina she was in school until her
father died-three years ago then
she studied typing and stepped into
her fathers shoes as man-of-the-
family

   i see  - laconically  and for
how long have you been assisting her
in this respect

as soon as i could persuade you to

 ac please she said  you shouldn t

 say these things to me

 - you asked me what had gone

wrong	  

 she drew a deep breath-glanced up

at him	

  but ii i don t marry you sne
 said  he wont disinherit you and
 im not intending to marry you so
 nothing is wrong at ter all

  you are going to marry me lie
 said  and to - somewhere or other

 with his money 

  i am not going to marry you she
 said  do you want me again to-day
 mr blackwell-or may i go

  i want you-not only to-day but
 always said he  and you may never
 go with my permission

 she flushed

  have you forgotten she asked

  that i am here-quite alone with

 you  

  what of that he cried im-
 patiently  am i to pretend im not
 in love with you just because we dont
 happen to be chaperoned  

  you are taking advantage of my
 presence here to say things that i pre-
 fer not to hear she answered
 gravely

    he hesitated an instant in silence
 looking down at her then he said
 gravely

     will you come up to the study an
 instant please  

    she nodded

      certainly she said

    he lead the way when they had
 entered the rowm and the door was
 closed behind them he said

     please take a letter for me

     a letter  she repeated

     do you mind  

     certainly not

    she drew a sheet of paper toward
 her and selecting her sharpest pencil
 waited

    dear miss neville he began
    she looked up blankly

     please-  she began

weekly

  wont you take my letter he

asked

  she hesitated flushed a little

shrugged

   i am writing this he dictated
to tell you that i love you and that
 want to marry you ive loved you
since the instant i saw you in front of
my car on fifty-ninth street i lied
about being an author and needing
you i- 

  if you are going to explain all
that said eve  you are merely
wasting time she knows it she
read  the mistress of the manse 
years ago and remembered it quite
well

    eve  he cried advancing

   she put aside her pad and pencil

   lets be sensible she said
 wait dont come near me please
until you hear what i have to say i
knew you were just pretending to be
an author- i let you because i-i
was as anxious to see you again as
you could possibly have been to see
me

  he took both her hands in his she
struggled to free them

  please she cried you
mustnt i could never never marry
you without your fathers consent

   why not he demanded

    i couldnt deprive you of so much
money youd hate me afterward

   nonsense do you think i care
about money i can earn enough for
both our needs i dont know how
ive never tried out but know that
i can you dont care about the
money do you eve  

   she flushed

   id rather have you if you were
a pauper she said  than any other
man in the world with millions but
i dont want to stand in your light
and there are my mother and
frankie remember-three of us
could you manage for us all 

    ive a little money he cant take
away my grandmother left it to
me he said  and what more we
need i will get somehow eve
cinder-eve



  that time she could no longer re-
sist him he drew her into his arms
and their lips met

   what does anything else matter
he cried  if we have each other we
can do without the blackwell money

  on the following wednesday cy-
rus blackwell sat before his desk in
an attitude of listless dejection when
his secretary announced  mr but-
ler this jovial gentleman strode
over to him with a hearty hand-clasp

 how are you old man they
tell me things are looking up-that
you have an even chance at least-
with thompson why whats the
matter you dont look very chipper
over the news

   chipper hell  was the succinct
reply

   bless me whats the reason for
the tears  blackwell swung around
in his chair angrily

   that fool boy of mine wants to
marry his stenographer and- 

   stenographer didnt even know
he was in business 

   oh hes been writing a book
and as the others roar of incredulous
laughter subsided blackwell stated
the facts of the case and an unwilling
gleam of amusement came into his
stern eyes as he recounted the part
played by  the mistress of the
manse

  butler chuckled often during the
recital and when blackwell finished
slapped him violently on the knee

  gad the boys a wonder turn
genius like that into business channels
and youll own the world let him
have her itll make a man of him
instead of a mollycoddle with too
much money to spend he loves her
and hes willing to work for her
give him a good job but make him
earn the salary besides this mar-
riage will accomplish more for you
than anything else during the cam-
paign you need the backing of the
common people they have an in-
born suspicion of our class but when

they find out that money and society
cant make you turn up your nose at
your sons marrying his secretary
their confidence in you will crystallize
overnight of course if she isnt a
lady- 

    oh shes all right on that score
reluctantly admitted blackwell  and
ogden said her mother was a hamp-
ton of south carolina in the same
tone an englishman speaks of queen
victoria

  hampton of south carolina
bluest blood in the state see here
cyrus youre making a bad mistake
youre not the man ive grown up
with and loved and admired all these
years if you let the fact that the girl
has earned an honest living stand in
the way of ogdens happiness

   but his mother and grace- 
bother his mother and grace
ill get my wife to talk to them she
can persuade anybody

  and after exhorting his friend in
like vein for half an hour he went out
leaving the latter in a very lenient
frame of mind induced by the com-
forting thought that the opposition of
his wife and daughter would be much
softened by the knowledge that mrs
franklin butler social arbiter ap-
proved and abetted the match

  late in the afternoon cyrus black-
well climbed the stairs to his sons
rooms to find that young man di-
sheveled and dusty perched on the re-
sisting top of a much overfilled trunk
ogden looked up with a glance of
inquiry which speedily changed to a
hostile glare when he recognized the
intruder

   ogden said his father in depre-
catory tones  are you really going to
leave us for that girl

   i am sir i love her and im go-
ing to marry her with or without your
consent im grateful to you for hav-
ing given me all this luxury-he
made a sweeping and dramatic gesture
across the richness of the room- but
i care so much for her that i dont
want it without her

amid a setting of unbelievably ugly

she yielded to their joint and fervent

the desert

   by jennie harris oliver

 i am the desert life-

  tenacious wizard life

  i grasp and hold and hug each shriveled thing

  i know no loss and fear no withering

 gray mummied sticks and threadlets powder-dry
 we fiercely cherish them the gods and i

          i am the desert life

 i am the desert wind-

  the wild resistless wind

  i lace the skies with hot white mystery

 and drive the sands with death and treachery
 the dunes that mark a pictured waste to-day
  shift and shape in more fantastic way

         i am the desert wind

 i am the desert stars-

  the lambent low-hung stars

  i weave a tent of glowing witchery

 and woo grim shapes with softening sorcery

  i gather jewels from the ether rare

  and give them glistening to the desert air

           i am the desert stars

 i am the desert moon-

 the white enchanted moon

  i lay a floor of burnished-silver light

  and bridge with gems the danger-place of night

  i brew a cup of hope wine-cool and sweet

  and pour it glowing at the deserts feet

          i am the desert moon

 i am the desert bones-

  the dry bleached crumbling bones

  the barrens drew me from the things that were
  my harvest blossoms-change the harvester
  without my sacrifice the things that be
  had never been the desert needed me

           i am the desert bones

the man who died

  tt returned from the city
q  about three oclock on ihat
may afternoon pretty well
disgusted with life i had
been three months in the
old country and was fed-up
with it if any one had
told me a year ago that i would have
been feeling like that i should have
called him a liar but there was the
fact

  the weather made me liverish the
talk of the ordinary englishman made
me sick i couldnt get enough exer-
cise and the amusements of london
seemed as flat as soda-water that has
been standing in the sun  richard
hannav i kept telling myself  you
have got into the wrong ditch my
friend and you had better climb out

  it made me bite my lips to think of
all the plans i had been building up
those last years in buluwavo i had
got my pile-not one of the big ones
but good enough for me and i had
figured out all kinds of ways of en-
joying myself

  my father had brought me out from
scotland at the age of six and i had
never been home since so england
was a sort of arabian nights to
me and i counted on stopping there

for the rest of my days but from the
first i was disappointed with it

  in about a week i was tired of see-
ing sights and in less than a month i
had had enough of restaurants and
theaters and race meetings i had no
real pal to go about with which prob-
ably explains things plenty of people
invited me to their houses but they
didnt seem much interested in me
they would ask me a question or two
about south africa and then get on to
their own affairs a lot of imperialist
ladies asked me to tea to meet school-
masters from new zealand and editors
from vancouver and that was the dis-
malest business of all

  here was i thirty-seven years old
sound in wind and limb with enough
money to have a good time yawning
my head off all day i had just about
settled to clear out and get back to
the veld for i was the best-bored
man in the lnited kingdom

  that afternoon i had been worrying
my brokers about investments to give
my mind something to work on and
on my way home i turned into my
club-rather a pot-house which took
in colonial members i had a long
drink and read the evening papers
they were full of the row in the near
east and there was an article about
karolides the greek premier

  i rather fancied the chap


  from all accounts he seemed the one
big man in the show and he played a
straight game tix which was more
than could be said for most of them

i gathered that they hated him pretty
blackly in berlin and vienna but that
we were going to stick to him and one
paper said that he was the only barrier
between europe and armageddon

  i remember wondering if  could get
a iob in those parts it struck me that
albania was the sort of place that
might keep a man from yawning

  about six oclock i went home
dressed dined at the cafe royal and
turned into a music-hall it was a
silly show all capering women and
raonkev-faced men and i did not stay
long the night was fine and clear as
i walked back to the flat i had hired
near portland place the crowd
surged past me on the pavements all
busy and chattering and i envied the
people for having something to do

  these shop-girls and clerks and
dandies and policemen had some in-
terest in life that kept them going

  i gave half a crown to a beggar be-
cause i saw him yawn he was a fel-
low sufferer at oxford circus i
looked up into the spring sky and i
made a vow i would give the old
country another day to fit me into
something if nothing happened i
would take the next boat for the cape

  my flat was the first floor in a new
block behind langham place

  there was a common staircase with
a porter and a liftman at the entrance
but there was no restaurant or any-
thing of that sort and each flat was
quite shut off from the others i hate
servants on the premises so i had a
fellow to look after me who came in
by the day

  he arrived before eight oclock
every morning and used to depart at
seven for i never dined at home

  i was just fitting my key into the
door when t noticed a man at my el-
bow i had not seen him approach
and the sudden appearance made me
start he was a slim man with a short

all-story weekly

brown beard and small gimlety blue

eyes

   i recognized him as the occupant of
a flat on the top floor with whom i had
passed the time of day on the stairs

  can i speak to you he said

 may i come in for a minute  he
was steadying his voice with an effort
and his hand was pawing my arm

  i got my door open and motioned
him in no sooner was he over the
threshold than he made a dash for my
back room where i used to smoke and
write my letters then he bolted back

   is the door locked   he asked
feverishly and he fastened the chain
with his own hand

   im very sorry he said humbly
 its a mighty liberty but you looked
the kind of man who would under-
stand ive had you in my mind all
this week when things got trouble-
some say will you do me a good
turn  

    ill listen to you i said  thats
all ill promise i was getting wor-
ried by the antics of this nervous little
chap

  there was a tray of drinks on a
table beside him from which he filled
himself a stiff whisky and soda he
drank it off in three gulps and cracked
the glass as he set it down

    pardon he said  im a bit rat-
tled to-night you see i happen at
this moment to be dead

  i sat down in an armchair and lit
my pipe

    what does it feel like i asked
i was pretty certain that i had to deal
with a madman

  a smile flickered over his drawn
face  im not mad-yet say mr
hannay ive been watching you and
i reckon youre a cool customer i
reckon too youre an honest man and
not afraid of playing a bold hand
im going to confide in you i need
help worse than any man ever needed
it and i want to know if i can count
you in  

   get on with your yarn i said
 and then ill tell you
the thirty-nine steps



  pie seemed to brace himself for a
great effort and then started on the
queerest rigmarole i didnt get hold
of it at first and i had to stop and ask
him questions but here is the gist of
it

  pie was an american from ken-
tucky and after college being pretty
well off he had started out to see the
world he wrote a bit and acted as
war correspondent for a chicago
paper and spent a year or two in
southeastern europe i gathered that
he was a fine linguist and had got to
know pretty well the society of those
parts he spoke familiarly of many
names that i remembered to have seen
in the newspapers

  he had played about with politics
he told me-at first for the interest of
them and then because he couldnt
help himself i read him as a sharp
restless fellow who always wanted to
get down to the roots of things he
got a little farther down than he
wanted

  i am giving you what he told me
as well as i could make it out away
behind all the governments and -the
armies there was a big subterranean
movement going on engineered by
very dangerous people he had come
on it by accident it fascinated him
he went further and then got caught

  i gathered that most of the people in
it were the sort of educated anarchists
that make revolutions but that besides
them there were financiers who were
playing for money

  a clever man can make big profits
on a falling market and it suited the
plans of both classes to set europe by
the ears he told me some queer
things that explained a lot that had
puzzled me-things that happened in
the balkan war how one state sud-
denly came out on top why alliances
were made and broken why certain
men disappeared and where the
sinews of war came from

  t he aim of the whole conspiracy
was to get russia and germany at
loggerheads

  when i asked why he said that the
anarchist lot thought it would give
them their chance everything would
be in the melting-pot and they looked
to see a new world emerge the
capitalists would rake in the shekels
and make fortunes by buying up
wreckage

  capital he said had no conscience
and no fatherland besides the jew
was behind it and the jew hated
russia worse than hell

   do you wonder  he cried  for
three hundred years they have been
persecuted and this is the return match
for the pogroms the jew is every-
where but you have to go far down
the back stairs to find him

   take any big teutonic business
concern if you have dealings with
it the first man you meet is prince von
something an elegant young man who
talks eaton-and-harrow english but
he cuts no ice if your business is big
you get behind him and find a progna-
thous westphalian with a retreating
brow and the manners of a hog

  he is the german business man that
gives your english papers the shakes
but if youre on the biggest kind of a
job and are bound to get to the real
boss ten to one you are brought up
against a little white-faced jew in a
bath-chair with an eye like a rattle-
snake yes sir he is the man who is
ruling the world just now and he has
his knife in the empire of the czar be-
cause his father was flogged in some
one-horse location on the volga

  i could not help saying that his tew
anarchists seemed to have got left be-
hind a little

   yes and no he said  they
won up to a point but they struck a
bigger thing than money a thing that
couldnt be bought-the old elemental
fighting instincts of man if youre
going to be killed you invent some
kind of flag and country to fight for
and if you survive you get to love the
thing these foolish devils of soldiers
have found something they care for
and that has upset the pretty plan laid


all-story weekly

in berlin and vienna but my friends
havent played their last card by a long
sight theyve got the aces up their
sleeves and unless i can keep ali e for
a month they are going to play it and

win-		  m r

   but i thought you were dead 

put in

   death is the door of lite he
smiled  im coming to that but ive
got to put you wise to a lot of things
first if you read your newspaper i
guess you know the name of constan-
tine karolides 

   i sat up at that for i had been read-
ing about him that very afternoon

   he is the man that has wtecked
all their games he is the one big
brain in the whole show and he hap-
pens also to be an honest man there-
fore he has been marked down these
twelve months past i found that out
-not that it was difficult for any fool
could guess as much but i found out
the way they were going to get him
and that knowledge was deadly thats
why i have had to decease

  he had another drink and i mixed
it for him myself for i was getting
interested in the beggar

    they cant get him in his own land
for he has a bodyguard of epirotes
that would skin their grandmothers
but on the fifteenth day of june he is
coming to this city the british
foreign office has taken to having in-
ternational tea-parties and the biggest
of them is due on that date now
karolides is reckoned the principal
guest and if my friends have their
way he will never return to his ad-
miring countrymen

   thats simple enough anyhow
i said  you can warn him and
keep him at home

   and play their game he asked
sharply  if he does not come they
win for hes the only man that can
straighten out the tangle and if his
government is warned lie wont come
for he does not know how big the
stakes will be on june 

   what about the british govern-

ment   i said  theyre not going
to let their guests be murdered tip
them the wink and theyll take extra
precautions

   no good they might stuff your
city with plain-clothes detectives and
double the police and constantine
would still be a doomed man my
friends are not playing this game for
fun they want a big occasion for
the taking off with the eyes of all
europe on it hell be murdered by
an austrian and therell be plenty of
evidence to show the connivance of
the big folk in vienna and berlin it
will all be an infernal lie of course
but the case will look black enough to
the world

    im not talking hot air ray friend

   i happen to know every detail of
the hellish contrivance and i can tell
you it will be the most finished piece
of blackguardism since the borgias
but its not going to come off if
ihcres a certain man who knows the
wheels of the business alive right here
in london on the th day of june
and that man is going to be your
servant franklin p scudder

   i was getting to like the little chap
his jaw had shut like a rat-trap and
there was the fire of battle in his
gimlety eyes if he was spinning me
a yarn he could act up to it

   where did you find out this
story i asked

    i got the first hint in an inn on
the achensee in tyrol that set me
inquiring and i collected my other
clues in a fur-shop in the galician
quarter of buda in a strangers club
in vienna and in a little book - shop
off the racknitzstrasse in leipsic i
completed my evidence ten days ago
in paris

    i cant tell you the details now
for its something of a tale when i
was quite sure in my own mind i
judged it my business to disappear
and i reached this city by a mighty
queer circuit i left paris a dandified
french-american and i sailed from
hamburg a jew diamond merchant
the thirty-nine steps



   in norway i was an english stu-
dent of ibsencollecting materials for
lectures but when i left bergen i
was a moving-picture man with spe-
cial skee films and i came here from
leith with a lot of pulpwood prepara-
tions in my pocket to put before the
london newspapers till yesterday i
thought i had muddied my trail
some and was feeling pretty happy
then-

  the recollection seemed to upset
him and he gulped down some
whisky

  -then i saw a man standing in
the street outside this block i used
to stay close in my room all day and
only slip out after dark for an hour
or two i watched him for a bit from
my window and i thought i recog-
nized him he came in and spoke to
the porter when i came back from
my walk last night i found a card in
my letter-box it bore the name of
the man i want least to meet on gods
earth

  i think that the look in my com-
panions eyes the sheer naked fright
on his face completed my conviction
of his honesty my own voice sharp-
ened a bit as i asked him what he did
next

   i realized that i was bottled as
sure as a pickled herring and that
there was only one way out i had
to die if my pursuers knew i was
dead they would go to sleep again

  how did you manage it
f told the man that valets me that
i was feeling pretty bad and i got
myself up to look like death that
wasnt difficult for im no slouch at
disguises then i got a corpse-you
can always get a body in london if
you know where to go for it i fetched
it back in a trunk on the top of a four-
wheeler and i had to be assisted up-
stairs to my room

   you see i had to pile up some
evidence for the inquest i went to
led and got my man to mix me a
sleeping-draft and then told him to
clear out he wanted to fetch a doc-

tor but i swore some and said i
couldnt abide leeches when i was
left alone i started in to fake up that
corpse

   he was my size and i judged had
perished from too much alcohol-so i
put some spirits handy about the place
the jaw was the weak point in the
likeness so i blew it away with a re-
volver i dare say there will be some-
body to - morrow to swear to having
heard a shot but there are no neigh-
bors on my floor and i guessed i
could risk that

   so i left the body in bed dressed
up in my pajamas with a revolver
lying on the bed-clothes and a consid-
erable mess around then i got into
a suit of clothes i had kept waiting
for emergencies i didnt dare to
shave for fear of leaving tracks and
besides it wasnt any kind of use my
trying to get into the streets

   i had had you in my mind all
day and there seemed nothing to do
but to make an appeal to you i
watched from my window till i saw
you come home and then slipped
down the stairs to meet you there
sir i guess you know about as much
as me of this business

  he sat blinking like an owl flutter-
ing with nerves and yet desperately
determined

  by this time i was pretty well con-
vinced that he was going straight with
me it was the wildest sort of narra-
tive  but i had heard in my time many
steep tales which had turned out to
be true and i had made a practise of
judging the man rather than the story

  if he had wanted to get a location
in my flat and then cut my throat he
would have pitched a milder yarn

   hand me your key i said  and
ill take a look at the corpse excuse
my caution but im bound to verify
a bit if i can

  he shook his head mournfully  i
reckoned youd ask for that but i
havent got it its on my chain 
the dressing-table i had to leave it
behind for i couldnt leave any clues


all-story weekly

to breed suspicions the gentry who
are after me are pretty bright - eyed

citizens youll have to take me an
trut for the night and to - morrow
youll get proof of the corpse business

right enough

  i thought for an instant or two

   right ill tmst you for the
night ill lock you into this room
and keep the key just one word
mr scudder i believe youre straight
but if so be you are not i should warn
you that im a handy man with a gun
sure he said jumping up with
some briskness   havent the privi-
lege of your name sir but let me tell
you that youre a white man ill
thank you to lend me a razor

  i took him into my bedroom and
turned him loose

  in half an hours time a figure came
out that i scarcely recognized only
his gimlety hungry eyes were the
same he was shaved clean his hair
was parted in the middle and he had
cut his eyebrows

  further he carried himself as if he
had been drilled and was the very
model-even to the brown complexion
-of some british officer who had had
a long spell in india he had a mono-
cle too which he stuck in his eye and
every trace of the american had gone
out of his speech

  my hat mr scudder- i stam-
mered

   not mr scudder he corrected
 captain theophilus digby of the
seventh goorkhas presently home on
leave ill thank you to remember
that sir

  i made him up a bed in my smoking-
room and sought my own couch more
cheerful than i had been for the past
month things did happen occasion-
ally even in this god-forsaken me-
tropolis 

  t woke next morning to hear my
man paddock making the deuce of a
row at the smoking-room door

  paddock was a fellow i had done a
good turn to out on the selakwi and

i had inspanned him as my servant
as soon as  got to england he had

about as much gift of the gab as a
hippopotamus and was not a great
hand at valeting but i knew i could

count on his loyalty

   stop that row paddock i said
 theres a friend of mine captain-
captain- i couldnt remember the
name dossing down in there get
breakfast for two and then come and
speak to me

  i told paddock a fine story about
how my friend was a great swell with
his nerves pretty bad from overwork
who wanted absolute rest and still-
ness nobody had got to know he
was here or he would be besieged by
communications from the india office
and the prime minister and his cure
would be ruined

  i am bound to say scudder played
up splendidly when he came to break-
fast

  he fixed paddock with his eye-
glass just like a british officer asked
him about the boer war and slung
out at me a lot of stuff about imagi-
nary pals of whom i had never heard
paddock couldnt learn to call me
sir but he sirred scudder as if
his life depended on it

  i left him with the newspaper and
a box of cigars and went down to the
city till luncheon when  got back
the porter had an important face

   nawsty business ere this morn-
ing sir gent in no  been and
shot isself theyve just took im to
the mortuary the police are up there
now

  i ascended to no  and found a
couple of bobbies and an inspector
busy making an examination i asked
a few idiotic questions and they soon
kicked me out then i found the man
that had valeted scudder and pumped
him but i could see he suspected
nothing

  he was a whining fellow with a
churchyard face and half a crown
went far to console him

   attended the inquest next day a
the thirty-nine steps



partner of some publishing firm gave
evidence that the deceased had brought
him wood-pulp propositions and had
been he believed an agent of an
american business the jury found
it a case of suicide while of unsound
mind and the few effects were handed
over to the american consul to deal
with

  i gave scudder a full account of the
affair and it interested him greatly
he said he wished he could have at-
tended the inquest for he reckoned it
would be about as spicy as to read
ones own obituary notice

  the first two days he stayed with
me in that back room he was very
peaceful he read and smoked a bit
and made a heap of jottings in a note-
book and every night we had a game
of chess at which he beat me hollow

  i think he was nursing his nerves
back to health for he had had a pretty
trying time

  but on the third day i could see he
was beginning to get restless he
fixed up a list of the days till june 
and ticked each off with a red pen-
cil and made remarks in shorthand
against them i would find him sunk
in a brown study with his sharp eyes
abstracted and after these spells of
meditation he was apt to be very des-
pondent

  then i could see that he began to
get edgy again he listened for little
noises and was always asking me if
paddock could be trusted once or
twice he got very peevish and apolo-
gized for it i didnt blame him

  i made every allowance for he had
taken on a fairly stiff job

  it was not the safety of his own
skin that troubled him but the suc-
cess of the scheme he had planned
that little man was clean pluck all
through without a soft spot in him
one night he was very solemn

   say hannay he said  i judge
i should let you a bit deeper into this
business i should hate to go out with-
out leaving somebody else to put up a
fight

  and he began to tell me in detail
what i had only heard from him
vaguely

  i did not give him very close atten-
tion the fact is i was more inter-
ested in his own adventures than in
his high politics i reckoned that
karolides and his affairs were not my
business leaving all that to him

  so a lot that he said slipped clean
out of my memory i remember that
he was very clear that the danger to
karolides would not begin till he had
got to london and would come from
the very highest quarters where there
would be no thought of suspicion he
mentioned the name of a woman--
julia czechenyi-as having something
to do with the danger

  she would be the decoy i gathered
to get karolides out of the care of his
guards he talked too about a black-
stone and a man that lisped in his
speech and he described very particu-
larly somebody that he never referred
to without a shudder - an old man
with a young voice who could hood
his eyes like a hawk

  he spoke a good deal about death
too he was mortally anxious about
winning through with his job but he
didnt care a rush for his life

   i reckon its like going to sleep
when you are pretty well tired out and
waking to find a summer day with the
scent of hay coming in at the window
i used to thank god for such morn-
ings way back in the blue-grass coun-
try and i guess ill thank him when
i wake up on the other side of jor-
dan

  next day he was much more cheer-
ful and read the life of stonewall
jackson much of the time i went out
to dinner with a mining engineer i had
got to see on business and came back
about half past ten in time for our
game of chess before turning in

  i had a cigar in my mouth i re-
member as  pushed open the smo-
king-room door the lights were not
lit which struck me as odd i won-
dered if scudder had turned in
	all-story

  i snapped the switch but there was
nobody there then  saw something
in the far corner which made me drop
my cigar and fall into a cold sweat

  my guest was lying sprawled on his
back there was a long knife through
his heart which skewered him to the
floor

chapter ii

the milkman starts on his travels

i sat down in an armchair and felt
very sick that lasted for maybe
five minutes and was succeeded
by a at of the horrors the poor
staring white face on the floor was
more than i could bear and i managed
to get a table-cloth and cover it then
i staggered to a cupboard found the
brandy and swallowed several mouth-
fuls

  i had seen men die violently before
indeed i had killed a few myself in
the matabele war but this cold-
blooded indoor business was different
still i managed to pull myself to-
gether

  i looked at my watch and saw that
ir was half past ten an idea seized
me and i went over the flat with a
small-tooth comb there was nobody
there nor any trace of anybody but
i shuttered and bolted all the windows
and put the chain on the door

  by this time my wits were coming
back to me and i could think again
it took me about an hour to figure
the thing out and i did not hurry
for unless the murderer came batj i
had till about six oclock in the morn-
ing for my cogitations

    i was in the soup-that was pretty
clear any shadow of a doubt i might
have had about the truth of scudders
tale was now gone the proof of it
was lying under the table-cloth the
men who knew that he knew what
he knew had found him and had taken
the best way to make certain of his
silence

    yes but he had been in my rooms

weekly

four days and his enemies must have
reckoned that he had confided in me
so  would be the next to go it might
be that very night or next day or
the day after but my number was up
all right

   then suddenly i thought of another
probability supposing i went out now
and called in the police or went to
bed and let paddock find the body and
call them in the morning what kind
of a story was i to tell about scudder

  i had lied to paddock about him
and the whole thing looked desperately
fishy if  made a clean breast of it
and told the police anything he had
told me they would simply laugh at
me the odds were a thousand to
one that i would be charged with the
murder and the circumstantial evi-
dence was strong enough to hang me

  few people knew me in england
i had no real pal who could come
forward and swear to my character
perhaps that was what those secret
enemies were playing for they were
clever enough for anything and an
english prison was as good a way of
getting rid of me till after june  as
a knife in my chest

   besides if i told the whole story
and by any miracle was believed i
would be playing their game karo-
lides would stay at home which was
what they wanted somehow or other
the sight of scudders dead face had
made me a firm believer in his scheme

  he was gone but he had taken me
into his confidence and i was pretty
well bound to carry on his work you
may think this ridiculous for a man
in danger of his life but that was the
way i looked at it

   i am an ordinary sort of fellow not
braver than other people but i hate to
see a good man downed and that long
knife would not be the end of scudder
if t could play the game in his place

   it took me an hour or two to think
this out and by that time i had come
to a decision t must vanish somehow
and keep vanished till the end of the
second week of june
the thirty-nine steps



  then i must somehow find a way
to get in touch with the government
people and tell them what scudder had
told me

  i wished to heaven he had told me
more and that i had listened more
carefully to the little he had told me
i knew nothing but the barest facts
there was a big risk that even if i
weathered the other dangers i would
not be believed in the end i must take
my chance of that and hope that some-
thing might happen which would con-
firm my tale in the eyes of the gov-
ernment

  my first job was to keep going for
the next three weeks it was now the
th day of may and that meant
twenty days of hiding before i could
venture to approach the powers that
be i reckoned that two sets of people
would be looking for me-scudders
enemies to put me out of existence
and the police who would want me
for scudders murder

  it was going to be a giddy hunt
and it was queer how the prospect
comforted me i had been slack so
long that almost any chance of activity
was welcome when i had to sit alone
with that corpse and wait on fortune
i was no better than a crushed worm
but if my necks safety was to hang
on my own wits i was prepared to be
cheerful about it

 the next thought was whether
scudder had any papers about him to
give me a better clue to the business
i drew back the table-cloth and
searched his pockets i had no longer
any shrinking from the body the
face was wonderfully calm for a man
who had been struck down in a mo-
ment

  there was nothing in the breast -
pocket and only a few loose coins and
a cigar-holder in the waistcoat the
trousers held a little penknife and some
silver and the side-pocket of his jacket
contained an old crocodile-skin cigar-
case

  there was no sign of the little black
book in which i had seen him making

notes that had no doubt been taken
by his murderer

  but as i looked up from my task
i saw that some drawers had been
pulled out in the writing-table scud-
der would never have left them in that
state for he was the tidiest of mortals
some one must have been searching
for something-perhaps for the note-
book

  i went round the flat and found that
everything had been ransacked-the
inside of books drawers cupboards
boxes even the pockets of the clothes
in my wardrobe and the sideboard in
the dining-room there was no trace
of the book

  most likely the enemy had found
it but they had not found it on scud-
ders body

  then i got out an atlas and looked
at a big map of the british isles my
notion was to get off to some wild
district where my veldcraft would be
of some use to me for i would be like
a trapped rat in a city i considered
that scotland would be best for my
people were scotch and i could pass
anywhere as an ordinary scotsman i
had half an idea at first to be a german
tourist for my father had had german
partners and i had been brought up to
speak the tongue pretty fluently not
to mention having put in three years
prospecting for copper in german
damara-land

  but i calculated that it would be
less conspicuous to be a scot and less
in a line with what the police might
know of my past i fixed on galloway
as the best place to go to it was
the nearest wild part of scotland so
far as i could figure it out and from
the look of the map was not overthick
with population

  a search in bradshaw informed me
that a train left st pancras at seven-
ten which would land me at galloway
station in the late afternoon that
was well enough but a more important
matter was how i was to make my
way to the station for i was pretty
certain that scudders friends would

bt watching outside this puzzled me
for a bit then i had an inspiration on
which i went to bed and slept for two

troubled hours

  i got up at four and opened my bed-
room shutters the faint light of a
fine summer morning was flooding the
skies and the sparrows had begun to
chatter i had a great revulsion of
feeling and felt a god-forgotten fool

  my inclination was to let things
slide and trust to the british police
taking a reasonable view of my case
but as i reviewed the situation i could
find no arguments to bring against my
decision of the previous night so with
a wry mouth i resolved to go on with
my plan i was not feeling in any par-
ticular funk only disinclined to go
looking for trouble if you understand
me

   i hunted out a well-used tweed suit
a pair of strong-nailed boots and a
flannel shirt with a collar into my
pockets i stuffed a spare shirt a cloth
cap some handkerchiefs and a tooth-
brush i had drawn a good sum in
gold from the bank two days before
in case scudder should want money
and  took fifty pounds of it in sov-
ereigns in a belt which i had brought
back from rhodesia that was about
all i wanted then i had a bath and
cut my mustache which was long and
drooping into a short stubbly fringe

  now came the next step paddock
used to arrive punctually at seven-
thirty and let himself in with a latch-
key but about twenty minutes to
seven as j knew from bitter expe-
rience the milkman turned up with a
great clatter of cans and deposited
my share outside my door

  i had seen that milkman sometimes
when i had gone out for an early ride
he was a young man about my own
height with a scrubby mustache
dressed in a white overall on him i
staked all my chances

  i went into the darkened smoking-
room where the rays of morning light
were beginning to creep through the
shutters there  breakfasted off a

whisky-and-soda and some biscuits
from the cupboard by this time it
was getting on to six oclock

    put a pipe in my pocket and filled
my pouch from the tobacco jar on the
table by the fireplace as i poked into
the tobacco my fingers touched some-
thing hard and i drew out scudders
little black note-book

  that seemed to me a good omen i
lifted the cloth from the body and
was amazed at the peace and dignity
of the dead face  good-by old
chap i said  i am going to do my
best for you wish me well wherever
you are

   then i hung about in the hall wait-
ing for the milkman that was the
worst part of the business for i was
fairly choking to get out of doors
six-thirty passed then six-forty but
still he did not come

   the fool had chosen this day of all
days to be late

  at one minute after the quarter to
seven i heard the rattle of the cans
outside  opened the front door and
there was my man singling out my
can from a bunch he carried and
whistling through his teeth he
jumped a bit at the sight of me

   come in here a moment i said
 i want a word with you and i
led him into the dining-room

    i reckon youre a bit of a sports-
man i said  and i want you to do
me a service lend me your cap and
overall for ten minutes and heres a
sovereign for you

   his eyes opened at the sight of the
gold and he grinned broadly  whats
the game  he asked

  a bet i said i havent time
to explain but to win it ive got to be
a milkman for the next ten minutes
all youve got to do is to stay here
till i come back youll be a bit late
but nobody will complain and youll
have that quid for yourself

   right-o  he said cheerily  i
aint the man to spoil a bit of sport
heres the rig guvnor

   i stuck on his flat blue hat and his
the thirty-nine steps



white overall picked up the cans
hanged my door and went whistling
down-stairs the porter at the foot
told me to shut my jaw which sound-
ed as if my make-up was adequate

  at first i thought there was nobody
in the street then i caught sight of
a policeman a hundred yards down
and a loafer shuffling past on the other
side some impulse made me raise my
eyes to the house opposite and there
at a first-floor window was a face

  as the loafer passed he looked up
and i fancied a signal was exchanged

  i crossed the street whistling gaily
and imitating the jaunty swing of the
milkman then i took the first side
street and turned up a left-hand turn-
ing which led past a lot of vacant
ground there was no one in the little
street so i dropped the milk-cans in-
side the hoarding and sent the hat and
overall after them

  i had only just put on my cloth cap
when a postman came round the cor-
ner i gave him good morning and
he answered me unsuspiciously just
then the clock of a neighboring church
struck the hour of seven

  there was not a moment to spare

  as soon as i got to euston road i
took to my heels and ran the clock
at euston station showed five minutes
past the hour at st pancras i had
no time to take a ticket let alone that
i had not settled upon my desination
a porter told me the platform and as
i entered it i saw the train already in
motion

  two station officials blocked the
way but i dodged them and clambered
into the last carriage

  three minutes later as we were
roaring through the northern tunnels
an irate guard interviewed me he
wrote out for me a ticket to newtown
stewart a name which had suddenly
come back to my memory and he con-
ducted me from the first - class com-
partment where i had ensconced my-
self to a third-class smoker occupied
by a sailor and a stout woman with a
child

  he went off grumbling and as i
mopped my brow i observed to my
companions in my broadest scotch
that it was a sore job catching trains
i had already entered upon my part

   the impidence o that gyaird
said the lady bitterly  he needit a
scotch tongue to pit him in his place
he was complainin o this wean no
haein a ticket and her no fower till
august twelvemonth and he was ob-
jectin to this gentleman spittin

  the sailor cheerfully agreed and i
started my newr life in an atmosphere
of protest against authority i re-
minded myself that a week ago i had
been finding the world dull

chapter iii

the literary innkeepers adventure

had a solemn time traveling north
that day

     it was fine may weather with
the hawthorn flowering on every
hedge and i asked myself why when
i was still a free man i had stayed on
in london and not got the good of
this heavenly country i didnt dare
face the restaurant car but i got a
luncheon basket at leeds and shared
it with the fat woman

  also i got the mornings papers
with news about starters for the derby
and the beginning of the cricket season
and some paragraphs about how bal-
kan affairs were settling down and a
british squadron was going to kiel

  when i had done with them i got
out scudders little black note-book
and studied it it was pretty well
filled with jottings chiefly figures
though now and then a name was
printed in for example i found the
words  hofgaard  luneville and
 avocado  pretty often and especial-
ly the word  pavia

  now i was certain that scudder
never did anything without a reason
and i was pretty sure that there was
a cipher in all this that is a subject
which has always interested me and
 i did a bit at it myself once as intel-
 ligence officer at delagoa bay during

thboer war

  i have always had a head tor things

like chess and puzzles and i used to

reckon myself pretty good at finding

out ciphers	

  this one looked like the numerical
kind where sets of figures correspond
to the letters of the alphabet but any
fairly shrewd man can find the clue
to that sort after an hour or twos
work and i didnt think scudder
would have been content with any-
thing so easy so i fastened on the
printed words for you can make a
pretty good numerical cipher if you
have a key-word which gives you the
sequence of the letters

   tried for hours but none of the
words answered

  then i fell asleep and woke at
dumfries just in time to bundle out
and get into the slow galloway train
there was a man on the platform
whose looks i didnt like but he never
glanced at me and when i caught
sight of myself in the mirror of an
automatic machine i didnt wonder

  with my brown face my old
tweeds and my slouch i was the very
model of one of the hill farmers who
were crowding into the third-class car-
riages

  i traveled with half a dozen in an
atmosphere of shag and clay pipes
they had come from the weekly mar-
ket and their mouths were full of
prices i heard accounts of how the
lambing had gone up the cairn and
the deuch and a dozen other myste-
rious waters

   above half the men had lunched
heavily and were highly flavored with
whisky but they let me alone wre
rumbled slowly into a land of little
wooded glens and then to a great wide
moorland place gleaming with lochs
with high blue hills showing north-
ward

    about five oclock the carriages had
   emptied and i was left alone as i had
   hoped i got out at the next station

weekly

a little place whose name i scarcely
noted set in the heart of a bog it

reminded me of one of those forgotten
little stations in the karros

  an old station-master was digging
in his garden and with his spade over
his shoulder sauntered to the train
took charge of a parcel and went back
to his potatoes a child of ten ret
ceived my ticket and  emerged frn a
white road that straggled over the
brown moss

  it was a gorgeous spring evening
with every hill showing as clear as a
cut amethyst

  the air had the queer rooty smell of
bogs but it was as fresh as mid-
ocean and it had the strangest effect
on my spirit i actually felt light-
hearted i might have been a boy out
for spring-holiday tramp instead of a
man of thirty-seven very much want-
ed by the police

  i felt just as i used to feel when 
was starting for a big trek on a frosty
morning on the high veld

  if you believe me i swung along
that road whistling there was no
plan of campaign in my head only
just to go on and on in this blessed
honest-smelling hill country for every
mile put me in better humor with my-
self

  in a roadside planting i cut a walk-
ing stick of hazel and presently struck
off the highway up a by-path which fol-
lowed the glen of a brawling stream

   i reckoned that i was still far ahead
of any pursuit and for that night
might please myself it was some
hours since i had tasted food and i
was getting very hungry when i came
to a herds cottage set in a nook beside
a waterfall a brown - faced woman
was standing by the door and greeted
me with the kindly shyness of moor-
land places

  when i asked for a nights lodging
she said i was welcome to the  lied
in the loft and very soon she set be-
fore me a hearty meal of ham and
eggs scones and thick sweet milk at
the darkening her man came in from
the thirty-nine steps



the hills a lean giant who in one step
covered as much ground as three paces
of ordinary mortals

  they asked no questions for they
had the perfect breeding of all dwell-
ers in the wilds but i could see they
set me down as some kind of dealer
and i took a little trouble to confirm
their view

  i spoke a lot about cattle of which
my host knew little and i picked up
from him a good deal about the local
galloway markets which i tucked
away in my memory for future use
at ten i was nodding in my chair and
the bed in the loft received a weary
man who never opened his eyes till
five oclock set the little homestead
a going once more

  they refused any payment and by
six i had breakfasted and was stri-
ding southward again

  my notion was to return to the rail-
way line a station or two farther on
than the place where i had alighted
yesterday and to double back i reck-
oned that was the safest way for the
police would naturally assume that i
was always making farther from lon-
don in the direction of some western
port

  i thought i had still a good bit of
a start for as i reasoned it would
take some hours to fix the blame on
me and several more to identify the
fellow who got on board the train at
st pancras

  it was the same jolly clear spring
weather and i simply could not con-
trive to feel careworn indeed i was
in better spirits than i had been lor
months over a long ridge of moor-
land i took my road skirting the side
of a high hill which the herd had
called cairnsmore of fleet

  nesting curlews and plovers were
crying everywhere and the links of
green pasture by the streams were
dotted with young lambs all the
slackness of the past months was slip-
ping irom my bones and i stepped out
like a i our-year-old by and by i came
to a swell of moorland which dipped

     	a-s

to the vale of a little river and a mile
away in the heather i saw the smoke
of a train

  the station when i reached it
proved to be ideal for my purpose
the moor surged up around it and left
room only for the single line the slen-
der siding a waiting-room an office
the station-masters cottage and a tiny
yard of gooseberries and sweet william

  there seemed no road to it from
anywhere and to increase the desola-
tion the waves of a loch lapped on their
gray granite beach half a mile away
i waited in the deep heather till i
saw the smoke of an east-going train
on the horizon then i approached
the tiny booking-office and took a
ticket for dumfries

  the only occupants of the carriage
were an old shepherd and his dog-a
wall-eyed brute that i mistrusted the
man was asleep and on the cushions
beside him was that mornings scots-
man eagerly i seized on it for i
fancied it would tell me something

  there were two columns about the
portland place murder as it was
called my man paddock had given
the alarm and had the milkman arrest-
ed poor devil it looked as if the lat-
ter had earned his sovereign hardly
but for me he had been cheap at the
price for he seemed to have occupied
the police the better part of the day

  in the stop-press news i found a fur-
ther instalment of the story

  the milkman had been released i
read and the true criminal about
whose identity the police were reti-
cent was believed to have got away
from london by one of the northern
lines there was a short note about
me as the owner of the flat

  i guessed the police had stuck that
in as a clumsy contrivance to per-
suade me that i was unsuspected

  there was nothing else in the paper
nothing about foreign politics or karo-
lides or the things that had interested
scudder i laid it down and found
that we were approaching the station
at which i had got out yesterday the


all-story weekly

potato - digging station - master had
been gingered tip into some activity
for the west-going train was waiting
to let us pass and from it had descend-
ed three men who were asking him
questions

  i supposed that they were the local
police who had been stirred up by
scotland yard and had traced me as
far as this one-horse siding

  sitting well back in the shadow i
watched them carefully one of them
had a book and took down notes the
old potato-digger seemed to have
turned peevish but the child who had
collected my ticket was talking volubly
all the party looked out across the
moor where the white road departed
i hoped they were going to take up my
tracks there

  as we moved away from that sta-
tion my companion woke up he
fixed me with a wondering glance
kicked his dog viciously and inquired
w here he was clearly he was very
drunk

   thats what comes o bein a tee-
totaler he observed in bitter tones

  i expressed my surprise that in him
i should have met a blue-ribbon stal-
wart

   aye but im a strong teetotaler
he said pugnaciously  i took the
pledge last martimmass and i havena
touched a drop o whisky sinsyne no
even at hogmanay though i was sair
tempted

  he swung his heels up on the seat
and burrowed a frowsy head into the
cushions

   and thats a i get he moaned
 a heid hetter than hell fire and twae
een lookin different wavs for sun-
day

  what did it i asked

   a drink they ca brandy bein a
teetotaler i keepit off the whisky but
i was nip-nippin a day yestereen at
this brandy and i doubt iii no be weel
for a fortnicht

  his voice died away into a stutter
and sleep once more laid its heavy hand
on him

  my plan had been to get out at some
station down the line but the train
suddenly gave me a better chance for
it came to a standstill at the end of a
culvert which spanned a brawling
porter-colored river  looked out
and saw that every carriage window
was closed and no human figure ap-
peared in the landscape

  so i opened the door and dropped
quickly into the tangle of hazels
which edged the line

  it would have been all right but for
that infernal dog under the impres-
sion that  was decamping with its
masters belongings it started to bark
and all but got me by the trousers
this woke up the herd who stood bawl-
ing at the carriage door in the belief
that  had committed suicide

  i crawled through the thicket
reached the edge of the stream and
in cover of the bushes put a hundred
yards or so behind me

  then from my shelter i peered back
and saw the guard had several passen-
gers gathered round the open carriage
door and staring in my direction i
could not have made a more public de-
parture if i had left with a bugler and
a brass band

  happily the drunken herd provided
a diversion he and his dog which
was attached by a rope to his waist
suddenly cascaded out of the carriage
landed on their heads on the track and
rolled some way down the bank to-
ward the water in the rescue which
followed the dog bit somebody for i
could hear the sound of hard swear-
ing

  presently they had forgotten me
and when after a quarter of a miles
crawl i ventured to look back the train
had started again and was vanishing
in the cutting

  i was in a wide semicircle of moor-
land with the brown river as radius
and the high hills forming the north-
ern circumference there was not a
sign or sound of a human being
only the plashing water and the inter-
minable crying of curlews yet oddly
the thirty-nine steps



enough for the first time i felt the
terror of the hunted on me

  it was not the police that i thought
of but the other folk who knew that
i knew scudders secret and dared not
let me live i was certain that they
would pursue me with a keenness and
vigilance unknown to the british law
and that once their grip closed on me
i should find no mercy

  i looked back but there was nothing
in the landscape

  the sun glinted on the metals of
the line and the wet stones in the
stream and you could not have found
a more peaceful sight in the world
nevertheless i started to run crouch-
ing low in the runnels of the bog i
ran till the sweat blinded my eyes
the mood did not leave me till i had
reached the rim of mountain and flung
myself panting on a ridge high above
the young waters of the brown river

  from my vantage ground i could
scan the whole moor right away to the
railway line and to the south of it
where green fields took the place of
heather i have eyes like a hawk but
i could see nothing moving in the
whole countryside

  then i looked east beyond the ridge
and saw a new kind of landscape-
shallow green valleys with plentiful fir
plantations and the faint lines of dust
which spoke of highroads

  last of all i looked into the blue
may sky and there i saw that which
set my pulses racing low down in
the south a monoplane was climbing
into the heavens i was as certain as
if i had been told that that aeroplane
was looking for me and that it did
not belong to the police for an hour
or two i watched it from a pit of
heather

  it flew low along the hilltops and
then in narrow circles back over the
valley up which i had come then it
seemed to change its mind rose to a
great height and flew away back to
the south

  i did not like this espionage from
the air and i began to think less well

of the countryside i had chosen for a
refuge these heather hills were no
sort of cover if my enemies were in
the sky i must find a different kind
of sanctuary

  i looked with more satisfaction to
the green country beyond the ridge
for there i should find woods and
stone houses

  about six in the evening i came out
of the moorland to a white ribbon of
road which wound up the narrow vale
of a lowland stream as i followed it
fields gave place to banks the glen be-
came a plateau and presently i had
reached a kind of pass where a soli-
tary house smoked in the twilight

  the road swung over a bridge and
leaning on the parapet was a man

  he was smoking a long clay pipe
and studying the water with spectacled
eyes in his left hand was a small
book with a finger marking the place
slowly he repeated-

  as when a gryphen through the wil-
      derness

  with winged step oer hill and moory
      dale

  pursues the arimaspian-

  he jumped round as my step rung
on the keystone and i saw a pleasant
sunburnt boyish face

   good evening to you he said
gravely  its a fine night for the
road

  the smell of wood smoke and of
some savory roast floated to me from
the house  is that place an inn  
i asked

  at your service he said politely
 i am the landlord sir and i hope
you will stay the night for to tell you
the truth i have had no company for
a week

  i pulled myself up on the parapet
of the bridge and filled my pipe i
began to detect an ally

   youre young to be an innkeeper-
i said

   my father died a year ago and
left me the business i live there with
my grandmother its a slow job for


 a young man and it wasnt my choice

 of profession

    which was 

 	he actually blushed i want to

 write books he said

 	and what letter chance could vou
 ask  cried man ive often
 thought that an innkeeper would make
 the best story-teller in the world 

   not now he said eagerly
 maybe in the old days when you
had pilgrims and ballad - makers and
highwaymen and mail-coaches on the
road but not now nothing comes
here but motor-cars full of fat women
who stop for lunch and a fisherman
or two in the spring and the shooting
tenants in august there is not much
material to be got out of that i want
to see life to travel the world and
write things like kipling and conrad
but the most ive done yet is to get
some verses printed in chamberss
journal

   i looked at the inn standing golden
 in the sunset against the wine-red hills

    ive knocked a bit about the world
 and i wouldnt despise such a hermi-
 tage dyou think that adventure is
 found only in the tropics or among
 gentry in red shirts maybe youre
 rubbing shoulders with it at this mo-
 ment

    thats what kipling says he
 said his eyes lightening and he quoted
 some verse about  romance bringing
 up the nine-fifteen

    heres a true tale for you then
 i cried  and a month hence you can
 make a novel out of it

   sitting on the bridge in the soft
 may gloaming i pitched him a lovely
 yarn it was true in essentials too
 though i altered the minor details i
 made out that i was a mining magnate
 from kimberley who had had a lot
 of trouble with i d b and had

alt- story weekly

 shown up a gang they had pursued
 me across the ocean and had killed
 my best friend and were now on

my track

  i told the story well though i say

it who shouldnt

  i pictured a flight across the kala-
hari to german africa the crackling
parching days the wonderful blue-
velvet nights i described an attack
on my life on the voyage home and
i made a really horrid affair of the
portland place murder

  youre looking for adventure
i cried well youve found it here
the devils are after me and the police
are after them its a race that i
mean to win

   by god he whispered drawing
his breath in sharply  it is all pure
rider haggard and conan doyle

   you believe me i said grate-
fully

  of course i do and he held out
his hand  i believe everything out
of the common the only thing to
distrust is the normal

  he was very young but he was the
man for my money

   i think theyre off my track for
the moment but i must lie close for
a couple of days can you take me

                                    in

                                      he caught my elbow in his eager-
                                    ness and drew me toward the house
                                     you can lie as snug here as if you
                                    were in a mouse-hole ill see that no-
                                    body blabs either and youll give
                                    me some more material about your
                                    adventures 

                                         as i entered the inn porch i heard
                                       from far off the beat of an engine
                                       there silhouetted against the dusky
                                       west was mv friend the monoplane

                                      he gave me a room at the back of
                                    the house with a fine outlook over the

       this refers to the illicit diamond buyers of south africa as explained by dr george
 frederick kunz in an address before the national geographic society  the diamond min-
 ing companies of south africa have unusual power under the laws of the colony so that no one is per-
 mitted to buy or sell diamonds unless authorized rough diamond buyers any one in whose possession
 uncut stones are found is brought to immediate punishment and the penalty is unusually severe for in-
 nocent or guilty buyers or guilty dealers the detective system is remarkable people in all walks
 of life belong to this special force had it not been for the importance of the diamond mines under

plateau and he made me free of his
own room which was stacked with
cheap editions of his favorite authors
i never saw the grandmother so i
guessed she was bedridden

  an old woman called margit brought
me my meals and the innkeeper was
around me at all hours

  i wanted some time to myself so i
invented a job for him he had a
motorcycle and i sent him off next
morning for the daily paper which
usually arrived with the post in the
late afternoon i told him to keep his
eyes skinned and make note of any
strange figure he saw keeping a spe-
cial shaqd lookout for motors and
aeroplanes

  then i sat down in real earnest to
scudders note-book

  pie came back at midday with the
scotsman there was nothing in it
except some further evidence of pad-
dock and the milkman and a repeti-
tion of yesterdays statement that the
murderer had gone north but there
was a long article reprinted from the
tunes about karolides and the state
of affairs in the balkans though
there was no mention of any visit to
england i got rid of the innkeeper
for the afternoon for i was getting
very warm in my search for the cipher

  as i told you it was a numerical
cipher and by an elaborate system of
experiments i had pretty well discov-
ered what were the nulls and stops
the trouble was the key - word and
when i thought of the odd million
words he might have used i felt
pretty hopeless but about three
oclock i had a sudden inspiration

  the name julia czechenyi flashed
across my memory scudder had said
it was the key to the karolides busi-
ness and it occurred to me to try it
on his cipher

  it worked the five letters of
 julia  gave me the position of the
vowels a was j the tenth letter of
the alphabet and so represented by x
in the cipher  czechenji  gave me
tlie numerals for the principal conson-

ants i scribbled that scheme on a bit
of paper and sat down to read scud-
ders pages

  in half an hour i was reading with
a whitish face and fingers that drum-
med on the table i glanced out of
the window and saw a big touring-
car coming up the glen toward the
inn it drew up at the door and there
was the sound of people alighting
there seemed to be two of them men
in acquascutums and tweed caps

  ten minutes later the innkeeper
slipped into the room his eyes bright
with excitement

   theres two chaps below looking
for you he whispered  theyre in
the dining-room having whiskys and
sodas they asked about you and
said they had hoped to meet you here
oh and they described you jolly well
down to your boots and shirt i told
them you had been here last night and
had gone off on a mortorcvcle this
morning and one of the chaps swore
like a navvy i made him tell me
what they looked like

  one was a dark-eyed thin fellow
with bushy eyebrows the other was
always smiling and lisped in his talk
neither wras any kind of foreigner on
this my young friend was positive

  i took a bit of paper  and wrote
these words in german as if they
were part of a letter

  black stone scudder had got on to
this but he could not act for a fortnight
i doubt if i can do any good now espe-
cially as karolides is uncertain about his
plans but if mr t advises i will do
the best i   

  i manufactured it rather neatly so
that it looked like a loose page of a
private letter

   take this down and say it was
found in my bedroom and ask them to
return it to me if they overtake me

  three minutes later i heard the car
begin to move and peeping from be-
hind the curtain caught sight of the
two figures one was slim the other
was sleek that was the most i could
make of my reconnaissance

  the innkeeper appeared in great ex-
citement  your paper woke them
up he said gleefully  i he dark
fellow went as white as death and
cursed like blazes anil the fat one
whistled and looked ugly they paid
for their drinks with half a sovereign
and wouldnt wait for change

   now ill tell you what i want you
to do i said  get on your bicycle
and go off to newton stewart to the
chief constable describe the two
men and say you suspect them of
having had something to do with the
london murder you can invent rea-
sons the two will come back never
fear not to-night for theyll follow
me forty miles along the road but
first thing to-morrow morning tell
the police to be here bright and early

  he set off like a docile child while
i worked at scudders notes

  when he came back we dined to-
gether and in common decency i had
to let him pump me i gave him a
lot of stuff about lion hunts and the
matabele war thinking all the while
what tame businesses these were com-
pared to this i was now engaged in
when he went to bed i sat up and
finished scudder

  i smoked in a chair till daylight for
i couldnt sleep

  about eight next morning i wit-
nessed the arrival of two constables
and a sergeant they put their car in
a coach-house under the innkeepers
instructions and entered the house
twenty minutes later i saw from my
window a second car come across the
plateau from the opposite direction

  it did not come up to the inn but
stopped two hundred yards off in the
shelter of a patch of wood t noticed
that its occupants carefully reversed it
beiore leaving it a minute or two
later i heard their steps on the gravel
outside the window

  my plan had been to lie hid in my
bedroom and see what happened i
had a notion that if i could bring the
police and my other more dangerous
pursuers together something might

work out of it to my advantage but
now i had a better idea

  i scribbled a line of thanks to my
host opened the window and dropped
quietly into a gooseberry bush

  unobserved i crossed the dike
crawled down the side of a tributary
burn and won the highroad on the
far side of the patch of trees there
stood the car very spick and span in
the morning sunlight but with the
dust on her which told of a long jour-
ney i started her jumped into the
chauffeurs seat and stole gently out
on to the plateau

  almost at once the road dipped so
that i lost sight of the inn but the
wind seemed to bring me the sound
of angry voices

chapter iv

the radical candidates adventure

you may picture me driving that
forty-horse-power car for all she
was worth over the crisp moor
roads on that shining may morning
glancing back at first over my shoul-
der and looking anxiously to the next
turning then driving with a vague
eye just wide enough awake to keep
on the highway

  for i was thinking desperately of
what i had found in scudders note-
book

  the little man had told me a pack
of lies all his yarns about the bal-
kans and the foreign office confer-
ence were eve-wash and so was karo-
lides and yet not quite as you shall
hear

  i had staked everything on my be-
lief in his story and had been let
down here was his book telling me a
different tale and instead of being
once-bit-twice-shy i believed it abso-
lutely why i dont know

  it rang desperately true and the
first yarn if you understand me had
been in a queer way true also in spirit
the fifteenth day of june was going
to be a day of destiny a bigger des-
the thirty-nine steps



tiny than the killing of a man it
was so big that i didnt blame scud-
der for keeping me out of the game
and wanting to play a lone hand

  that i was pretty clear was his in-
tention

  he had told me something which
sounded big enough but the real thing
was so immortally big that he the
man who had found it out wanted it
all for himself i didnt blame him
it was risks after all that he was
chiefly greedy about

  the whole story was in the notes-
with gaps you understand which he
would have filled up from his me-
mory

  he stuck down his authorities too
and had an odd trick of giving them
all a numerical value and then strik-
ing a balance which stood for the re-
liability of each stage in the yam
the three names he had printed were
authorities and there was a man du-
crosne who got five out of a pos-
sible five and another fellow am-
mersfoort who got three

  the bare bones of the tale were all
that was in the book-these and one
queer phrase which occurred half a
dozen times inside brackets u thirty-
nine steps  was the phrase and at its
last time of use it ran  thirty-nine
steps i counted them high tide 
pm

  i could make nothing of that

  the first thing i learned was that
it was no question of preventing a
war that was coming as sure as
christmas had been arranged said
scudder ever since february 
karolides was going to be the occa-
sion

  he was booked all right and was
going to hand in his checks on june
 two weeks and four days from
that may morning i gathered from
scudders notes that nothing on earth
could prevent that his talk of epi-
rote guards that would skin their own
grandmothers was all nonsense

  the second thing was that this war
was going to come as a mighty sur-

  prise to britain karolidess death
would set the balkans by the ears and
then vienna would chip in with an
ultimatum russia wouldnt like that
and there would be high words

  but berlin would play the peace-
maker and pour oil on the waters till
suddenly she would find a good cause
for a quarrel pick it up and in five
hours let fly at us that was the
idea and a pretty good one too

  honey and fair speeches and then
a stroke in the dark while we were
talking about the good will and good
intentions of germany our coast
would be silently ringed with mines
and submarines would be waiting for
every battleship

  but all this depended upon the
third thing which was due to happen
on june  i would never have
grasped this if i hadnt once hap-
pened to meet a french staff officer
coming back from west africa who
had told me a lot of things

  one was that in spite of all the non-
sense talked in parliament there was
a real working alliance between
france and britain and that the two
general staffs met every now and
then and made plans for joint action
in time of war well in june m
royer the french minister of ma-
rine was coming over from paris
and he was going to get nothing less
than a statement of the disposition of
the british home fleet on mobilization

  at least i gathered it was some-
thing like that anyhow it was some-
thing uncommonly important but
on the th day of tune there were
to be others in london-others at
whom i could only guess scudder
was content to call them collectively
the black stone

  they represented not our allies but
our deadly foes and the information
destined for france was to be
diverted to their pockets and it was
to be used remember-used a week
or two later with great guns and
swift torpedoes suddenly in the dark-
ness of a summer night


all-story weekly

  this was the story  had been de-
ciphering in- a back room of a coun-
try inn overlooking a cabbage gar-
den this was the story that hum-
med in my brain as i swung in the
big touring-car from glen to glen

  my first impulse had been to write
a letter to the prime minister but a
little reflection convinced me that that
ivould be useless who would believe
my tale

  i must show a sign some token in
proof and heaven knew what that
fcould be

  above all i must keep going myself
ready to act when things got riper
and that was going to be no light job
with the police of the british isles in
full cry after me and the watchers
of the black stone running silently
and swiftly on my trail

  i had no very clear purpose in my
journey but i steered east by the sun
for i remembered from the map that
if i went north i would come into a
region of coal-pits and industrial
towns presently i was down from
the moorlands and traversing the
broad haugh of a river

  for miles i ran alongside a park
wall and in a break of the trees i
saw a great castle

  t swung through little old thatched
streams and past gardens blazing
with hawthorn and yellow laburnum

  the land was so deep in peace that
i could scarcely believe that some-
where behind me were those who
sought my life ay and that in a
months time unless i had the al-
mightiest of luck these round coun-
try faces would be pinched and star-
ing and men would le lying dead in
english fields

  about midday i entered a long
straggling village and had a mind to
stop and eat half-way down was
the post-oftice and on the steps of it
stood the post-mi stress and a police-
man hard at work conning a telegram

   lien they saw me they wakened
up and the policeman advanced with
raised hand and cried on me to stop

  i nearly was fool enough to obey
then it flashed upon me that the wire
had to do with me that my friends
at the inn had come to an understand-
ing and were united in desiring to see
more of me and that it had been easy
enough for them to wire the descrip-
tion of me and the car to thirty vil-
lages through which i might pass

  i released the brakes just in time
as it was the policeman made a claw
at the hood and only dropped off
when he got my left in his eye

  i saw that main roads were no
place for me and turned into the by-
ways it wasnt an easy job without
a map for there was the risk of get-
ting onto a farm road and ending
in a duck-pond or a stable-vard and
i couldnt afford that kind of delay

  i began to see what an ass i had
been to steal the car

  the big green brute would be the
safest kind of clue to me over the
breadth of scotland if i left it and
took to my feet it would be dis-
covered in an hour or two and i would
get no start in the race

  the immediate thing to do was to
get to the lonliest roads these i
soon found when i struck up a tribu-
tary of the big river and got into a
glen with steep hills all about me and
a corkscrew road at the end which
climbed over a pass

  here i met nobody but it was tak-
ing me too far north so i slued east
along a bad track and finally struck a
big double-line railway away below
me i saw another broadish valley and
it occurred to me that if i crossed it
i might find some remote hostelry to
pass the night

  the evening was now drawing in
and i was furiously hungry for i had
eaten nothing since breakfast except
a couple of buns i had bought from a
bakers cart

  just then i heard a noise in the sky
and lo and behold there was that in-
fernal aeroplane flying low about a
dozen miles to the south and rapidly
coming toward me
the thirty-nine steps



  i had the sense to remember that on
a bare moor i was at the aeroplanes
mercy and that my only chance was
to get to the leafy cover of the valley

  down the hill i went like blue
lightning screwing my head round
whenever i dared to watch that
damned flying machine soon i was
on a road between hedges and dip-
ping to the deep-cut glen of a stream

  then came a bit of thick wood
where i slackened speed

  suddenly on my left i heard the
hoot of another car and realized to
my horror that i was almost upon a
couple of gate-posts through which a
private road debouched on the high-
way my horn gave an agonized
roar but it was too late

  i clapped on my brakes but my im-
petus was too great and there before
me a car was sliding athwart my
course in a second there would have
been the deuce of a wreck i did the
only thing possible and ran slap into
the hedge on the right trusting to find
something soft beyond

  but there i was mistaken

  mv car slithered through the hedge
like butter and then gave a sickening
plunge forward i saw what was
coming leaped on the seat and would
have jumped out but a stout branch
of hawthorn got me in the chest
lifted me up and held me while a ton
or two of expensive metal slipped be-
low- me bucked and pitched and then
dropped with an almighty smash fifty
feet to the bed of the stream

  i subsided first on the hedge and
then very gently on a bower of net-
tles as i scrambled to my feet a
hand took me by the arm and a sym-
pathetic and badly scared voice asked
me if i were hurt

  i found myself looking at a tall
young man in goggles and a leather
ulster who kept on blessing his soul
and whinnying apologies for my-
self once i got my wind back i was
rather glad than otherwise

  this was one way of getting rid
of the car

   my blame sir i answered him
 its lucky that i did not add homi-
cide to my follies thats the end of
my scotch motor tour but it might
have been the end of my life

  he plucked out a watch and
studied it

   youre the right sort of fellow
he said  i can spare a quarter of an
hour and my house is two minutes
off ill see you clothed and fed and
snug in bed wheres your kit by
the way is it in the burn along with
the car 

   its in my pocket i said brand-
ishing a tooth-brush  im a colonial
and travel light

   a colonial he cried  by gad
youre the very man ive been pray-
ing for are you by any blessed
chance a free trader

   i am said i without the fog-
giest notion of what he meant

  he patted my shoulder and hurried
me into his car three minutes later
we drew up before a comfortable-
looking shooting-box set among pine
trees and he ushered me in-doors
he took me first to a bedroom and
flung half a dozen of his suits before
me for my own had been pretty well
reduced to rags

  i selected a loose blue serge which
differed most conspicuously from my
own garments and borrowed a linen
collar

  then he haled me to the dining-
room where the remnants of a meal
stood on the table and announced that
i had just five minutes to feed
 you can take a snack in your pocket
and well have supper when we get
back ive got to be at the masonic
hall at eigit oclock or my agent will
comb my hair

  i had a cup of coffee and some cold
ham while he yarned away on the
hearth-rug

   you find me in the deuce of a

mess mr - by the by you havent

told me your name twrisden any
relation of old tommy twisden of

liberal candidate or this part of the
world and i had a meeting on to-
night at brattleburn-that s my chief
town and an infernal tory strong-

hdi had got the colonial ex-pre-
mier fellow crumpleton coming to
speak for me to-night and had the
thing tremendously billed and the
whole place ground-baited this af-
ternoon i got a wire from the an
saying he has got influenza at black-
pool and here am  left to do the
whole thing myself i had meant to
speak for ten minutes and must now
go on tor forty and though  ve lieen
racking my brains for three hours to
think of something i simply cannot
last the course

   now youve got to e a good
chap and help me  oure a free
trader and can tell our people what
a wash-out protection is in the col-
onies all you fellows have the gift
of the gab-i wish to heavens i had
it ill be for evermore in your debt

  i had very few notions about free
trade one way or the other but t saw
no other chance to get what i wanted

  my young gentleman was far too
absorbed in his own difficulties to
think how odd it was to ask a
stranger who had just missed death
by an ace and had lost a one-thou-
sand-guinea car to address a meeting
for him on the spur of the moment
but my necessities did not allow me
to contemplate oddnesses or to pick
and choose my supports

  all right i said im not
much good as a speaker but ill tell
them a bit about australia

  at my words the cares of the ages
slipped from his shoulders and he was
rapturous in his thanks he lent me
a big driving coat-and never
troubled to ask why i had started in
a motor tour without possessing an
ulster-and as we shuffled down the
dusty roads poured into my ears the
simple facts of his history

  he was an orphan and his uncle
had brought him up ive forgotten

the uncles name but he was in the
cabinet and you can read his speeches

in the papers

  he had gone round the world after
leaving cambridge and then being
short of a job his uncle had advised
politics i gathered that he had no
preference in parties  good chaps
in both he said cheerfully u and
plenty of blighters too im liberal
because my family have always been
whigs

  but if he was lukewarm politically
he had strong views on other things
he found out i knew a bit about
horses and jawed away about the
derby entries and he was full of
plans for improving his shooting
altogether a very clean decent cal-
low young man

  as we passed through a little town
two policemen signalled us to stop
and flashed their lanterns on us
 beg pardon sir harry said one
 weve got instructions to look out
for a car and the descriptions no un-
like yours

   right-o said my host while i
thanked providence for the devious
ways i had been brought to safety

  after that we spoke no more for
my hosts mind began to labor heavily
with his coming speech his lips
kept muttering his eye wandered and
i began to prepare myself for a
second catastrophe i tried to think
of something to say myself but my
mind wras dr- as  stone

  the next thing i knew we had
drawn up outside a door in a street
and were being welcomed by some
noisv gentlemen in rosettes

  the hall had about five hundred in
it women mostly a lot of bald heads
and a dozen or two young men

  the chairman a weaselv minister
with a reddish nose lamented crum-
pletons absence soliloquized on his
influenza and gaze me a certificate as
a  trusted leader of australian
thought there were two policemen
at the door and i hoped they took
note of this testimonial
the thirty-nine steps



  then sir harry started

  i never heard anything like it he
didnt begin to know how to talk he
had about a bushel of notes from
which he read and when he let go
of them he fell into one prolonged
stutter

  every now and then he remem-
bered a phrase he had learned by
heart straightened his back and gave
it off like henry irving and the next
moment he was bent double and
crooning over his papers it was the
most appalling rot too

  he talked about the  german
menace and said it was all a tory
invention to cheat the poor of their
rights and keep back the great flood
of social reform but that  organized
labor  realized this and laughed the
tories to scorn he was all for re-
ducing our navy as a proof of our
good faith and then sending ger-
manv an ultimatum demanding that
she should do the same

  he said that but for the tories
germany and britain would be fellow
workers in peace and reform i
thought of the little black book in my
pocket

  yet in a queer way i liked the
speech you could see the niceness of
the chap shining out behind the non-
sense with which he had been spoon-
fed also it took a load off my mind
i mightnt be much of an orator but
i was a thousand per cent better than
sir harn i didnt get on so badly
when it came to my turn i simply
told them all i could remember about
australia praying there should be no
australian there-all about its labor
party and emigration and universal
service

  i doubt if i remembered to mention
free trade but i said there were no
tories in australia only labor and
liberals that fetched a cheer and
i woke them up a bit when i started
in to tell them the kind of glorious
business i thought could be made out
of the empire if we really put our
backs into it

  altogether i fancy i was rather a
success the minister didnt like me
though and when he proposed a vote
of thanks spoke of sir harrys speech
as  statesmanlike and mine as hav-
ing the  eloquence of an official emi-
gration agent

  when we were in the car again my
host was in wild spirits at having got
his job over  a ripping speech
twisden he said  now youre
coming home with me im all alone
and if youll stop a day or two ill
show you some very decent fishing
we had a hot supper-and i
wanted it pretty badly-and then
drank grog in a big cheery smoking-
room with a crackling wood fire i
thought the time had come for me to
put my cards on the table i saw by
this mans eye that he was the kind
you can trust

   listen sir harry i said  ive
something pretty important to say to
you youre a good fellow and im
going to be frank where on earth
did you get that poisonous rubbish
you talked to-night

  his face fell  was it as bad as
that lie asked ruefully it did
sound rather thin i got most of it
out of the liberal magazine and
pamphlets that agent chap of mine
keeps sending me but you surely
dont think germany would ever go
to war with us 

   ask that question in six weeks
and it wont need an answer i said
 if youll give me your attention for
half an hour i am going to tell you
a story

  i can see yet that bright room with
the deers heads and the old prints on
the walls sir harry standing rest-
lessly on the stone curb of the hearth
and myself lying back in an arm-
chair speaking i seemed to be an-
other person standing aside and list-
ening to my own voice and judging
carefully the reliability of my tale

  it was the first time i had ever told
any one the exact truth so far as i
understood it and it did me no end


all-story weekly

of good for it straightened out the
thing in my own mind

  i blinked no detail he heard all
about scudder and the milkman and
the note-book and my doings in gal-
loway presently lie got very excited
and walked up and down the hearth-
rug

   so you see i concluded  you
have got here in your house the man
that is wanted for the portland place
murder your duty is to send your
car for the police and give me up i
dont think ill get very far therell
be an accident and ill have a knife
in my ribs an hour or so after ar-
rest  nevertheless its your duty as
a law-abiding citizen perhaps in a
months time youll be sorry but you
have no cause to think of that

  he was looking at me with bright
steady eyes  what was your job in
rhodesia mr hannay  he asked

   mining engineer i said  ive
made my pile cleanly and ive had a
good time in the making of it

   not a profession that weakens
the nerves is it

  i laughed  oh as to that my
nerves are good enough i took
down a hunting knife from a stand
on the wall and did the old mashona
trick of tossing it and catching it in
my lips that wants a pretty steady
heart

  he watched me with a smile  i
dont want proofs i may be an ass
on the platform but i can size up a
man youre no murderer and youre
no fool and i believe you are speak-
ing the truth im going to back you
up now what can i do

    first i want you to wrritc a letter
to your uncle ive got to get in touch
with the government people some
time before the th of june 

  he pulled his mustache

   that wont help you this is
foreign office business and my uncle
would have nothing to do with it
besides you d never convince him
no ill go one better ill write to
the permanent secretary at the for-

eign office hes my godfather and
one of the best going what do you

want  

  he sat down at a table and wrote
to my dictation the gist of it was
that if a man called twisden i
thought i had better stick to that
name turned up before june  he
was to treat him kindly he said
twisden would prove his bona fides
by passing the word  black stone 
and whistling  annie laurie

   good said sir harry  thats
the proper style by the way youll
find my godfather-his names sir
walter bullivant-down at his coun-
try cottage for whitsuntide its
close to artinswell-on-the-kennet
thats done now whats the next
thing 

  youre about my height -lend
me the oldest tweed suit youve got
anything will do so long as the color
is the opposite of the clothes i de-
stroyed this afternoon then show
me a map of the neighborhood and
explain to me the lie of the land
lastly if the police come asking about
me just show them the car in the
glen if the other lot turn up tell
them i caught the south express after
your meeting

  he did or promised to do all these
things

  i shaved off the remnants of my
mustache and got inside an ancient
suit of what  believe is called heather
mixture the map gave me some no-
tion of my whereabouts and told me
the two things i wanted to know-
where the main railway to the south
could be joined and what were the
wildest districts near at hand

  at two oclock he wakened me
from my slumber in the smoking-
room armchair and let me blinking
into the dark starry night an old
bicycle was found in a tool-shed and
handed over to me

   first turn to the right up by the
long fir-wood he enjoined  by
daybreak youll be well into the hills
t hen i should pitch the machine into
the thirty-nine steps



a bog and take to the moors on foot
you can put in a week among the
shepherds and be as safe as if you
were in new guinea

  i pedaled diligently up steep roads
of hill gravel till the skies grew pale
with morning as the mists cleared
before the sun i found myself in a
wide green world with glens falling
on every side and a faraway blue
horizon here at any rate i could
get early news of my enemies

chapter v

the spectacled roadmans adventure

i sat down on the very crest of the
pass and took stock of my position
behind me was the road climbing
through a long cleft in the hills which
was the upper glen of some notable
river in front was a flat space of
maybe a mile all pitted with bog-holes
and rough with tussocks and then be-
yond it the road fell steeply down an-
other glen to a plain whose blue dim-
ness melted into the distance

  to left and right were round-shoul-
dered green hills as smooth as pan-
cakes but to the south-that is the
left hand-there was a glimpse of high
heathery mountains which i remem-
bered from the map as the big knot
of hill which i had chosen for my
sanctuary

  i was on the central boss of a huge
upland country and could see every-
thing moving for miles in the mead-
ows below the road half a mile back
a cottage smoked but it was the only
sign of human life otherwise there
was only the calling of plovers and the
tinkling of little streams

  it was now about seven oclock and
as i waited i heard once again the
ominous beat in the air then i re-
alized that my vantage ground might
be in reality a trap there was no
cover for a tomtit in those bald green
places

  i sat quite still and hopeless while
the beat grew louder

  then i saw an aeroplane coming up
from the east it was flying high but
as i looked it dropped several hundred
feet and began to circle round the knot
of hill in narrowing circles just as a
hawk wheels before it pounces now
it was flying very low and now the
watchman on board caught sight of
me

  i could see one of the two occu-
pants examining me through glasses
suddenly tf began to rise in swift
whorls and the next i knew it was
speeding eastward again till it became
a speck in the blue morning

  that made me do some savage think-
ing my enemies had located me and
the next thing would be a cordon
round me i didnt know what force
they could command but i was certain
it would be sufficient the aeroplane
had seen my bicycle and would con-
clude that i would try to escape by the
road

  in that case there might be a chance
on the moors to the right or left i
wheeled the machine a hundred yards
from the highway and plunged it into
a moss-hole where it sank among pond-
weed and water-buttercups then i
climbed to a knoll which gave me a
view of the two valleys nothing was
stirring on the long white ribbon that
threaded them

  i have said there was not cover in
the whole place to hide a rat as the
day advanced it was flooded with soft
fresh light till it had the fragrant sun-
niness of the south african veld at
other times i should have liked the
place but now it seemed to suffocate
me the free moorlands were prison
walls and the keen hill-air was the
breath of a dungeon

  i tossed a coin-heads right tails
left-and it fell heads so i turned to
the north in a little i came to the
brow of the ridge which was the con-
taining wall of the pass

  i saw the highroad for maybe ten
miles and far down it something that
was moving and which i took to be a
motor-car beyond the ridge i looked
all-story weekly

on a rolling green moor which fell
away into wooded glens now my
life on the veld has given me the eyes
of a kite and i can see things for
which most men need a telescope

  away down the slope a couple of
miles away men were advancing like
a row of beaters at a shoot

  i dropped out of sight behind the
skyline that way was shut to me
and i must try the bigger hills to the
south beyond the highway the car
i had noticed was getting nearer but
it was still a long road off with some
very steep gradients before it i ran
bard crouching low except in the hol-
lows and as  ran i kept scanning the
brow of hill before me

  was it imagination or did i see
figures-one two perliaps more-
moving in a glen beyond the stream

  if you are hemmed in on all sides
in a patch of land-there is only one
chance of escape you must stay in
the patch and let your enemies search
it and not find you that was good
sense but how on earth was i to escape
notice in that table-cloth of a place

  i would have buried myself to the
neck in mud and lain below water or
climbed the tallest tree but there was
not a stick of wood the bog-holes were
little puddles the stream was a slender
trickle there was nothing but short
heather and bare hill bent and the
white highway

  then in a tiny bight of road beside
a heap of stones i found the road-
man

  he had just arrived and was wear-
ily flinging down his hammer he
stared at me with fishy eyes yawning

  confoond the day i ever left the
herdin  he said as if to the world at
large  there i was my ain maister
now im a slave to the government-
tethered to the roadside wi sair een
and a back like a suckle

  he took up the hammer struck a
stone dropped the implement with an
oath and put both hands to his ears
 mercy on me my heids burstin 
he cried

  he was a wild figure about my own
size but much bent with a weeks
beard on his chin and a pair of big

horn spectacles

    canna daet he cried again
 the surveyor maun just report me
im for my bed

  i asked him what was the trouble
though indeed that was clear enough

   the trouble is that im no sober
last nicht my dochter merran was
waddit and they danced till fower in
the byre me and some ither chiels
sat dowm to the drinkin-and here i
am peety that i ever lookit on the
wine when it was red 

  i agreed with him about bed

   its easy speakin he moaned
 but i get a post-caird yestereen say-
in that the new road surveyor wrould
be round the day hell come and
hell no find me or else hell find me
fou and either way im a done man
ill avva back to my bed and say im
no weel but i doot thatll no help me
for they ken my kind o no-weelness
then i had an inspiration  does
the new surveyor know you  i asked

   no him hes just been a week
at the job he rins about in a w-ee
motor-car and wad speir the inside oot
o a whelk

   wheres your house i asked
and was directed by a wavering finger
to the cottage by the stream

   well back to your bed i said
 and sleep in peace ill take on your
job for a bit and see the surveyor

  he stared at me blankly then as
the notion dawned on his fuddled
brain his face broke into the vacant
drunkards smile

   youre the billy he cried  itll
be easy eneuch managed ive finished
that bing o stanes so you needen chap
ony mair this forenoon just take the
barn and wheel eneuch metal frae yon
quarry ddon the road to make anither
bing the morn

   my names alexander trumnile
and ive been seeveti year at the trade
and twenty afore that herdin on
leithen water my freends ca me
the thirty-nine steps



ecky and whiles specky for i wear
glasses bein weak i the sicht just
you speak the surveyor fair and ca
him sir-and hell be fell pleased ill
be back or midday

  i borrowed his spectacles and filthy
old hat stripped off coat waistcoat
and collar and gave him them to carry
home borrowed too the foul stump
of a clay pipe as an extra property

  he indicated my simple tasks and
without more ado set off at an amble
bedward bed may have been his
chief object but i think there was also
something left in the foot of a bottle
i prayed that he might be safe under
cover before my friends arrived on the
scene

  then i set to work to dress for the
part

  i opened the collar of my shirt-it
was a vulgar blue and white check such
as plowmen wear-and revealed a neck
as brown as any tinkers i rolled up
my sleeves and there was a forearm
which might have been a blacksmiths
-sunburnt and rough with old scars
i got my boots and trouser-legs all
white from the dust of the road and
hitched up my trousers tying them
with string below the knee

  then i set to work on my face
with a handful of dust i made a
water-mark round my neck-the place
where mr trummles sunday ablu-
tions might be expected to stop i
rubbed a good deal of dirt also into
the sunburn of my cheeks a road-
mans eyes would no doubt be a little
inflamed so i contrived to get some
dust in both of mine and by dint of
vigorous rubbing produced a bleary
effect

  the sandwiches sir harry had
given me had gone off with my coat
but the roadmans lunch tied up in a
red handkerchief was at my disposal

  i ate with great relish several of the
thick slabs of scone and cheese and
drank a little of th cold tea in the
handkerchief was a local paper tied
with string and addressed to mr

turnbull-obviously meant to solace

his midday leisure i did up the bun-
dle again and put the paper conspic-
uously beside it

  my boots did not satisfy me but by
dint of kicking among the stone i re-
duced them to the granitelike surface
which characterizes a roadmans foot-
gear then i bit and scraped my
finger-nails till the edges were all
cracked and uneven the men i was
matched against would miss no detail

  i broke one of the bootlaces and re-
tied it in a clumsy knot and loosed the
other so that my thick gray socks
bulged over the uppers still no sign
of anything on the road the motor
i had observed half an hour ago must
have gone home

  my toilet complete i took up the
barrow and began my journeys to and
from the quarry a hundred yards off
i remember an old scout in rhodesia
who had done many queer things in
his day-once telling me that the
secret of playing a part was to think
yourself into it you could never keep
it up he said unless you could man-
age to convince yourself that you
were it

  so i shut off all other thoughts and
switched them on the road-mending

   i thought of the little white cottage
as my home i recalled the years i had
spent herding on leithen water i
made my mind dwell lovingly on sleep
in a box-bed and a bottle of cheap
whisky still nothing appeared on that
long white road

  now and then a sheep wandered off
the heather to stare at me a heron
flopped down to a pool in the stream
and started to fish taking no more no-
tice of me than if i had been a mile-
stone on i went trundling my loads
of stone with the heavy step of the
professional

  soon i grew warm and the dust on
my face changed into solid and abiding
grit i was already counting the hours
till evening should put a limit to mr
turnbulls monotonous toil

  suddenly a crisp voice spoke from
the road and looking up i saw a little


all-story weekly

ford two-seater and a round-faced
young man in a bowler hat

   are you alexander turnbull  he
asked  i am the new county road
surveyor you live at blackhopefoot
and have charge of the section from
la id la why res to the riggs good a
fair bit of road turnbull and not bad-
ly engineered a little soft about a
mile off and the edges want cleaning
see you look after that good morn-
ing youll know me the next time
you see me

  clearly my get-up was good enough
tor the dreaded surveyor

  i went on with my work and as the
morning grew toward noon t was
cheered by a little traffic a bakers
van breasted the hill and sold me a bag
of ginger biscuits which i stowed in
my trouser - pockets against emer-
gencies then a herd passed with
sheep and disturbed me somewhat by
asking loudly  what had become o
specky 

   in bed wi the colic i replied
and the herd passed on

  just about midday a big car stole
down the hill glided past and drew up
a hundred yards beyond its three oc-
cupants descended as if to stretch their
legs and sauntered toward me

  two of the men i had seen before
from the window of the galloway inn
-one lean sharp and dark the other
comfortable and smiling the third
had the look of a countryman-a vet
perhaps or a small farmer he was
dressed in ill-cut knickerbockers and
the eye in his head was as bright and
wary as a hens

   morning said the last  thats
a fine easy job o yours

  i had not looked up on their ap-
proach and now when accosted i
slowly ard painfully straightened my
back after the manner of roadmen
spat vigorously after the manner of
the low scot and regarded them stead-
ily before replying i con fronted three
pairs of eyes that missed nothing

   theres waur jobs and theres bet-
ter i said sententiously   wad

rather hae yours siltin a day on your
hinderlands on thae cushions its you
and your muckle cawrs that wreck my
roads if we a had oor richts you
slid be made to mend what ye break 
the bright-eyed man was looking at
the newspaper lying beside turnbulls
bundle

   i see you get your papers in good
time he said

   glanced at it casually  aye in
good time seein that that paper cam
out last setterday im just fower days
late

  he picked it up glanced at the su-
perscription and laid it down again
one of the others had been looking at
my boots and a word in german called
the speakers attention to them

   youve a fine taste in boots he
said  those were never made by a
country shoemaker

   they were not i said readily
 they were made in london i got
them frae the gentleman that was here
last year for the shootin what was
his name now and i scratched a
forgetful head

  again the sleek one spoke in ger-
man  let us get on he said  this
fellow is all right

  they asked one last question

   did you see any one pass early
this morning he might be on a
bicycle or he might be on foot

  i very nearly fell into the trap and
told a storv of a bicyclist hurrying past
in the gray dawn but i had the sense
to see my danger i pretended to con-
sider very deeply

   i wasna up very early i said
 ye see my dochter was merrit last
nicht and we keepit it up late i
opened the house-door about seeven-
and there was naebody on the road
then since i cam up here there has
been just the baker and the rtichill
herd besides you gentlemen

one of them gave me a cigar which
t smelled gingerlyand stuck in turn-
bulls bundle they got into their car
and were out of sight in three minutes
my heart leaped with an enormous
the thirty-nine steps



relief but i went on wheeling my
stones it was as well for ten minutes
later the car returned-one of the oc-
cupants waving a hand to me these
gentry left nothing to chance

  i finished turnbulls bread and
cheese and pretty soon i had finished
the stones the next step was what
puzzled me

  i could not keep up this road-ma-
king business for long a merciful
providence had kept mr turnbull in-
doors but if he appeared on the scene
there would be trouble i had a notion
that the cordon was still tight round
the glen and that if i w-alked in any
direction i should meet with ques-
tioners

  but get out i must no mans nerve
could stand more than a day of being
spied on

  i stayed at my post till about five
oclock by that time i had resolved
to go dowm to turnbuhs cottage at
nightfall and take my chance of get-
ting over the hills in the darkness but
suddenly a new car came up the road
and slowed down to stop a short dis-
tance from me a fresh wind had
risen-and the occupant wanted to
light a cigarette

  it was a touring-car with the ton-
neau full of an assortment of bag-
gage one man sat in it and by an
amazing chance i knew him his name
was launcelot brown and he was an
offense to creation he was a sort of
blood stockbroker who did his business
by toadying to eldest sons and rich
young peers and foolish old ladies

   lancie  was a familiar figure i
understood at balls and polo-weeks
and country houses he was an adroit
scandalmonger and would crawl a
mile on his belly to anything that had
a title or a million i had a business
introduction to his firm when i came
to london and he was good enough to
ask me to dinner at his club

  there he showed off at a great rate
and pattered about his duchesses till
the snobbery of the creature turned me
sick i asked a man afterward why

    	a-s

nobody kicked him and was told that
englishmen reverenced the weaker sex

  anyhow there he was now nattily
dressed in a fine newr car obviously
on his w-ay to visit some of his fine
friends a sudden daftness took me
and in a second i had jumped into the
tonneau and had him by the shoulder

  hello brown i sang out
 well met my lad 

  he got a horrid fright his chin
dropped as he stared at me  who
the devil are you he gasped

   my names hannay i said
c from rhodesia you remember 

   good god-the murderer  he
choked

   just so and therell be a second
murder my dear if you dont do as i
bid you give me that coat of yours
that cap too

  he did as he wras bid for he was
blind with terror over my dirty
trousers and vulgar shirt i put on his
smart driving-coat which buttoned
high at the top and thereby hid the
deficiencies of my collar

  i stuck the cap on my head and
added his gloves to my get-up the
dusty roadman in a minute was trans-
formed into one of the neatest motor-
ists in scotland on mr launcelot
browns head i clapped turnbulls un-
speakable hat and told him to keep it
there

  then with some difficulty i turned
the car my plan was to go back the
road he had come for the watchers
having seen it before would let it pass
unremarked

   now my child i said  sit quite
still and be a good boy i mean you
no harm im only borrowing your
car for an hour or two but if you
play me any tricks-and above all if
you open your mouth-as sure as
theres a god above me ill wring
your neck saves 

  i enjoyed that evenings ride we
ran eight miles down the valley
through a village or two and i could
not help noticing several strange-look-
ing folk lounging by the roadside


all-story weekly

  these were the watchers who would
have had much to say to me it i had
come in other garb or company as
it was they looked incuriously on
one touched his cap in salute and i
responded graciously

  as the dark fell i turned up a side
glen which as i remembered from the
map led into an unfrequented corner
of the hills soon the villages were
left behind then the farms and then
even the wayside cottages presently
we came to a lonely moor where the
night was blackening the sunset gleam
in the bog - pools here we stopped
and i obligingly reversed the car and
restored to mr launcelot brown his
belongings

   a thousand thanks i said
 theres more use in you than i
thought now be off and find the
police

  as i sat on the hillside watching the
tail-light dwindle i reflected on the
various kinds of crime i had now
sampled contrary to general belief
i was not a murderer but i had be-
come an unholy liar a shameless im-
postor and a highwayman with a
marked taste for expensive motor-cars

chapter vi

the bald archeologists adventure

 spent the night on a shelf of the
hillside in the lee of a boulder
where the heather grew long and
soft it was a cold business for i had
neither coat nor waistcoat those were
in mr turnbulls keeping as was
scudders little book my watch and-
worst of all - mv pipe and tobacco-
pouch only my money accompanied
me in my belt and about half a pound
of ginger biscuits in my trouser-pocket

  i supped oft half those biscuits and
by worming myself deep into the
heather get some kind of warmth

  my spirits had risen and i was be-
ginning to enjoy this crazy game of
hide and seek so far f had been
miraculously lucky the milkman the

literary innkeeper sir harry the
roadman and the idiotic lancie were
all pieces of undeserved good fortune

  somehow the first success gave me
a feeling that i was going to pull the
thing through

  my chief trouble was that i was des-
perately hungry i lay and tortured
myself-for the ginger biscuits merely
emphasized the aching void-with the
memory of all the good food i had
thought so little of in london there
were paddocks crisp sausages and
fragrant shavings of bacon and shape-
ly poached eggs-how often i had
turned up my nose at them

  there were the cutlets they did at
the club and a particular ham that
stood on the cold table for which my
soul lusted my thoughts hovered over
all varieties of mortal edibles and
finally settled on a porter-house steak
and a quart of bitter with a welsh rab-
bit to follow in longing hopelessly
lor these dainties i fell asleep

  i woke very cold and stiff about an
hour after dawn

  it took me a little while to remember
where i was for i had been very
weary and had slept heavily i saw
first the pale blue sky through a net of
heather then a big shoulder of hill
and then my own boots placed neatly
in a blackberry-bush

  i raised myself on my arms and
looked down into the valley and that
one look set me lacing up my boots in
mad haste for there were men below
not more than a quarter of a mile off
spaced out on the hillside like a fan
and beating the heather lancie had
not been slow in looking for his re-
venge

  i crawled out of my shelf into the
cover of a boulder and from it gained
a shallow trench which slanted up the
mountain face this led me presently
into the narrow gully of a burn by
way of which i scrambled to the top
of the ridge from there i looked
back and saw that i was still undiscov-
ered my pursuers were patiently quar-
tering the hillside and moving upward
the thirtyrnjne steps



  keeping behind the skyline i ran
for maybe half a mile till i judged i
was above the uppermost end of the
glen then i showed myself and was
instantly noted by one of the flankers
who passed the word to the others

  i heard cries coming up from be-
low and saw that the line of search
had changed its direction

  i pretended to retreat over the sky-
line but instead went back the way i
had come and in twenty minutes was
behind the ridge overlooking my sleep-
ing place from that view-point i had
the satisfaction of seeing the pursuit
streaming up the hill at the top of the
glen on a hopelessly false scent

  i had before me a choice of routes
and i chose a ridge which made an
angle with the one i was on and so
would soon put a deep glen between
me and my enemies the exercise had
warmed my blood and i was begin-
ning to enjoy myself amazingly as
i went i breakfasted on the dusty
remnants of the ginger biscuits

  i knew very little about the country
and i hadnt a notion what i was going
to do i trusted to the strength of my
legs but i knew well enough that those
behind me would be familiar with the
lie of the land and that my ignorance
would be a heavy handicap

  i saw in front of me a sea of hills
rising very high toward the south but
northward breaking down into broad
ridges which separated wide and shal-
low dales the ridge i had chosen
seemed to sink after a mile or two to
a moor which lay like a pocket in the
uplands

  that seemed as good a direction to
take as any other

  my stratagem had given me a fair
start-call it twenty minutes-and i
had the width of a glen behind me be-
fore i saw the first heads of the pur-
suers the police had evidently called
in local talent to their aid and the men
 could see had the appearance of herds
or gamekeepers

  they hallooed at the sight of me
and i waved my hand two dived

into the glen and began to climb my
ridge while the others kept their own
side of the hill i felt as if i were
taking part in a schoolboy game of
hare and hounds

  but very soon it began to seem less
of a game those fellows behind were
hefty men on their native heath look-
ing back i saw that only three were
following direct and i guessed that
the others had fetched a circuit to cut
me off

  my lack of local knowledge might
very well be my undoing and i re-
solved to get out of this tangle of glens
to the pocket of moor i had seen from
the tops i must so increase my dis-
tance as to get clear away from them
and i believed i could do this if i could
find the right ground for it if there
had been cover i would have tried a
bit of stalking but on these bare slopes
you could see a fly a mile off

  my hope must be in the length of
my legs and the soundness of my wind
but i needed easier ground for that
for i was not bred a mountaineer
how i longed for a good africander
pony

  i put on a great spurt and got off
my ridge and down into the moor be-
fore any figures appeared on the sky-
line behind me i crossed a burn and
came out on a high-road which made
a pass between two glens

  all in front of me was a big field
of heather sloping up to a crest which
was crowned with an odd feather of
trees

  in the dike by the roadside was a
gate from which a grass-grown track
led over the first wave of the moor
i jumped the dike and followed it and
after a few hundred yards-as soon as
it was out of sight of the highway-
the grass stopped and it became a very
respectable road which was evidently
kept with some care

  clearly it ran to a house and i be-
gan to think of doing the same hither-
to my luck had held and it might be
that my best chance would be found in
this remote dwelling anyhow there


all-story weekly

were trees there - and that meant

cover

   did not follow the road but the
burnside which hanked it  the right
where the bracken grew deep and the
high banks made a tolerable screen it
was well  did so for no sooner had i
gained the hollow than looking back
i saw the pursuit topping the ridge
from which i had descended

  after that  did not look back-i
had no time i ran up the burnside
crawling over the open places and for
a large part wading in the shallow
stream i found a deserted cottage
with a row of fan tom peat stacks and
an overgrown garden

  then i was among young hay and
very soon had come to the edge of a
plantation of windblown firs from
there i saw the chimneys of the house
smoke a few hundred yards to my left

  i forsook the burnside crossed an-
other dike and almost before i knew
was on a rough lawn a glance back
told me that i was well out of sight of
the pursuit which had not yet passed
the first lift of the moor

  the lawn was a very rough place
cut with a scythe instead of a mower
and planted with beds of scrubby rho-
dodendrons a brace of black game
which are not usually garden birds
rose at my approach the house be-
fore me was the ordinary moorland
farm with a more pretentious white-
washed wing added attached to this
wing was a glass veranda and through
the glass i saw the face of an elderly
gentleman meekly watching me

  i stalked over the border of coarse
hill gravel and entered the open ve-
randa door

  within was a pleasant room glass
on one side and on the other a mass
of hooks more books showed in an
inner room on the floor instead of
tables stood cases such as you see in
a museum tilled with coins and queer
stone implements there was a knee-
hole desk in the middle and seated at
it with some papers and open volumes
before him was the benevolent old

gentleman his face was round and
shiny like mr pickwicks big glasses
stuck on the end of his nose and the
top of his head was as bright and bare

as a glass bottle

  he never moved when i entered but
raised his placid eyebrows and waited
on me to speak

  it was not an easy job with about
five minutes to spare to tell a stranger
who i was and what i wanted and to
win his aid i did not attempt it
there was something about the eye of
the man before me-something so
keen and knowledgeable that i could
not find a word i simply stared at
him and stuttered

   you seem in a hurry my friend
he said slowly

  i nodded toward the glass it gave
a prospect across the moor through a
gap in the plantation and revealed cer-
tain figures half a mile off straggling
through the heather

   ah i see he said and took up a
pair of field-glasses through which he
patiently scrutinized the figures

   a fugitive from justice eh well
well go into the matter at our leisure
meantime i object to my privacy
being broken in upon by the clumsy
rural policemen go into my study
and you will see two doors facing
you take the one on the left and
close it behind you you will be per-
fectly safe

  and this extraordinary man took up
his pen again

  i did as i was bid and found my-
self in a little dark chamber which
smelled of chemicals and was lit only
by a tiny window high up in the wall
the door had swung behind me with
a click like the door of a safe once
again i had found an unexpected
sanctuary

  all the same i was not comfortable
there was something about the old
gentleman which puzzled and rather
terrified me he had been too easy
and ready almost as if he had ex-
pected me and his eyes had been
horribly intelligent
the thirty-nine steps



  no sound came to me in that dark
place

  for all i knew the police might be
searching the house and if they did
they would want to know what was
behind this door i tried to possess my
soul in patience and to forget how
hungry i was then i took a more
cheerful view

  the old gentleman could scarcely re-
fuse me a mealand i fell to recon-
structing my breakfast bacon and
eggs would content me but i wanted
the better part of a flitch of bacon and
half a hundred eggs and then while
my mouth was watering in anticipa-
tion there was a click and the door
stood open

  i emerged into the sunlight to find
the master of the house sitting in a
deep armchair in the room he called his
study and regarding me with curious
eyes

   have they gone  i asked

   they have gone i convinced
them that you had crossed the hill i
do not choose that the police should
come between me and one whom i am
delighted to honor this is a lucky
morning for you richard hannay

  as he spoke his eyelids seemed to
tremble and to fall a little over his
keen gray eyes in a flash the phrase
of scudders came back to me when
he had described the man he most
dreaded in the world he had said
that he  could hood his eyes like a
hawk

  then i saw that i had walked
straight into the enemys headquarters
my first impulse was to throttle the old
ruffian and make for the rvpen air he
seemed to anticipate my intention for
he smiled gently and nodded to the
door behind me i turned and saw two
men servants who had me covered with
pistols

  he knew my name but he had never
seen me before and as the reflection
darted across my mind i saw a slender
chance

 dont know what you mean i
said roughly  and who are you call-

ing richard hannay my names
ainslie

   so  he said still smiling  but
of course you have others we wont
quarrel about a name

  i was pulling myself together now
and i reflected that my garb lacking
coat and waistcoat and collar would
at any rate not betray me i put on
my surliest face and shrugged my
shoulders

   i suppose youre going to give me
up after all and i call it a dirty trick
i wish i had never seen that cursed
motor-car heres the money and be
damned to you  and i flung four
sovereigns on the table

  pie opened his eyes a little  oh
no i shall not give you up my friends
and i will have a little private settle-
ment with you that is all you know
a little too much mr hannay you
are a clever actor but not quite clever
enough

  he spoke with assurance but i could
see the dawning of some doubt in his
mind

  for gods sake stop jawing i
cried  everythings against me i
havent had a bit of luck since i came
on shore at leith whats the harm
in a poor devil with an empty stomach
picking up some money he finds in a
bust-up motor-car thats all i done
and for that ive been chivvied for
two days by those blasted bobbies over
those blasted hills i tell you im fair
sick of it you can do what you like
old boy ned ainslies got no fight
left in him

  i could see that the doubt was gain-
ing

   will you oblige me with the story
of your recent doings he asked

   i cant guvnor i said in a real
beggars whine  ive not had a bite
to eat for two days give me a mouth-
ful of food and then youll hear gods
truth 

  i must have showed my hunger in
my face for he signaled to one of the
men in the doorway a bit of cold pie
was brought and a glass of beer and


all-story weekly

i wolfed them down like a pig - or
rather like ned ainslie for i was
keeping up my character

  in the middle of my meal he spoke
suddenly to me in german but i
turned on him a face as blank as a
stone wall

  then  told him my story-how 
had come off an archangel ship at
leitli a week ago and was making my
way overland to my brother at wigton
i had run short of cash-i hinted
vaguely at a spree-and i was pretty
well on my uppers when i had come
on a hole in a hedge and looking
through had seen a big motor-car
lying in the burn

  i had poked about to see what had
happened and had found three sov-
ereigns lying on the seat and one on the
floor there was nobody there or any
sign of an owner so i had pocketed
the cash but somehow the law had
got after me when i had tried to
change a sovereign in a bakers shop
the woman had cried on the police and
a little later when i was washing my
face in a burn i had been nearly
gripped and had only got awav by
leaving my coat and waistcoat behind
me

   they can have the money back
i cried  for a fat lot of good its
done me those perishers are all
down on a poor man now if it had
been you guvnor that had found the
quids nobody would have troubled
you

   youre a good liar hannay he
said

  i flew into a rage  stop fooling
i tell you my names ainslie and i
never heard of any one called hannay
in my born days id sooner have the
police than you with your hannays
and your monkey-faced pistol tricks
no guvnor i dont mean that im
much obliged to you for the grub ill
thank you to let me go now-the
coasts clear	

  it was evident he was badly puzzled
lyou see he had never seen me and my
appearance must have altered consid-

erably from my photographs - if he
had got one of them  was pretty
smart and well dressed in london and
now i was a regular tramp

   i do not propose to let you go it
you are what you say you are you will
soon have a chance of clearing your-
self if you are what i believe you
are i do not think you will see the
light much longer

  he rang a bell and a third servant
appeared from the veranda

   i want the lanchester in five min-
utes he said  there will be three
to luncheon

  then he looked steadily at me and
that was the hardest ordeal of all
there was something weird and devil-
ish in those eyes-cold malignant un-
earthly and most hellishly clever
they fascinated me like the bright eyes
of a snake

  i had a strong impulse to throw my-
self on his mercy and offer to join his
side and ii you consider the way i felt
about the whole thing you will see that
that impulse must have been purely
physical-the weakness of a brain mes-
merized and mastered by a stronger
spirit

  but i managed to stick it out-and
even to grin  youll know me next
time guvnor i said

   karl  he said in german to one
of the men in the doorway  you
will put this fellow in the store-room
till i return and you will be answera-
ble to me for his keeping

  i was marched out of the room with
a pistol at each ear

  the storeroom was a damp cham-
ber in what had been the old farm-
house there was no carpet on the
uneven floor and nothing to sit down
on but a school form it was black as
pitch for the windows were heavily
shuttered

  i made out by groping that the walls
were lined with boxes and barrels and
sacks of some heavy stuff the whole
place smelled of mold and disuse my
jailers turned the key in the door and
the thirty-nine steps



i could hear them shifting their feet
as they stood on guard outside

  i sat down in the chilly darkness in
a very miserable frame of mind the
old boy had gone off in a motor to
collect the two ruffians who had inter-
viewed me yesterday now they had
seen me as the roadman and they
would remember me for i was in the
same rig

  what was a roadman doing twenty
miles from his beat pursued by the
police a question or two would put
them in the track probably they had
seen the real turnbull probably
lancie too most likely they could
link me up with sir harry and then
the whole thing would be crystal
clear

  what chance had i in this moor-
land house with three desperadoes and
their armed servants i began to
think wistfully of the police now
plodding over the hills after my
wraith they at any rate were fel-
low countrymen and honest men and
their tender mercies would be kinder
than these ghoulish aliens

  but they wouldnt have listened to
me that old devil with his eyelids
had not taken long to get rid of them
i thought he probably had some kind
of graft with the constabulary most
likely he had letters from cabinet
ministers saying he was to be given
every facility for plotting against
britain

  thats the sort of owlish way we
rim our politics in the old country

  the three would be back for lunch
so i hadnt more than a couple of
hours to wait it was simply waiting
or destruction for i could see no way
out of this mess i wished that i had
scudders courage for i am free to
confess i didnt feel great fortitude

  the only thing that kept me going
was that i was pretty furious it
made me boil with rage to think of
those three spies getting the pull on
me like this t hoped that at any rate
t might be able to twist one of their
necks before they downed me

  the more i thought of it the angrier
i grew and i had to get up and move
about the room i tried the shutters
but they were the kind that lock with
a key and i couldnt move them

  from the outside came the faint
clucking of hens in the warm sun
then i groped among the sacks and
boxes i couldnt open the latter and
the sacks seemed to be full of things
like dog-biscuits that smelled of cinna-
mon but as i circumnavigated the
room i found a handle in the wall
which seemed worth investigating

  it was the door of a wall cupboard
-what they call a  press  in scot-
land-and it was locked

  i shook it and it seemed rather
flimsy for want of something bet-
ter to do i put out my strength on
that door getting some purchase on
the handle by looping my braces
round it presently the thing gave
with a crash which i thought would
bring in my warders to inquire

  i waited for a bit and then started
to explore the cupboard shelves

  there was a multitude of queer
things there i found an odd vesta
in my trouser pocket and struck a
light it went out in a second but
it shoaved me one thing there was
a little stock of electric torches on
one shelf i picked up one and found
it was in working order

  with the torch to help me i inves-
tigated further there were bottles
and cases of queer smelling stuffs
chemicals no doubt for experiments
and there were coils of fine copper
wire and hanks and hanks of a thin
oiled silk

  then away at the back of a shelf
i found a stout brown cardboard box
and inside it a wooden case i man-
aged to wrench it open and within
lay half a dozen little gray bricks
each about a couple of inches square

  i look up one and found that it
crumbled easily in my hand then i
smelled it and put my tongue to it
after that i sat down to think i
hadnt been a mining engineer for
	all-story weekly

nothing and i knew lentonite when

i saw it	 t 

  with one of these backs i could

blow the house to smithereens i had
used the stuff in rhodesia and knew
its power but the trouble was that
my knowledge wasnt exact

  i had forgotten the proper charge
and the right way of firing it or
rather i knew that it needed an elec-
tric spark but i wasnt sure about the
timing i had only a vague notion
to add to its power for though i had
used it i had not handled it with my
own fingers

  but it was a chance the only pos-
sible chance

  it was a mighty risk but against
it was an absolute black certainty if
i used it the odds were as i reckoned
about five to one in favor of my blow-
ing myself into the treetops but if i
didnt i should very likely be occupy-
ing a six-foot hole in the garden by
the evening

  that was the way i had to look at
it the prospect was pretty dark
either way but anyhow there was a
chance both for myself and for my
country

  the remembrance of little scudder
decided me it was about the beast-
liest moment of my life for im no
good at these cold-blooded resolu-
tions still i managed to rake up the
pluck to set my teeth and choke back

the horrid doubts that hooded in
on me

  i simply shut off my mind and pre-
tended i was doing an experiment as
simple as guy fawkess fireworks

  i pulled a couple of the electric
torches to pieces and with their small
batteries and coils of wire constructed
an elementary fuse then i took a
quarter of a lentonite brick and
buried it near the door below one of
the sacks in a crack of the floor link-
ing up my fuse to it for all i knew
half those boxes might lie dynamite

  if the cupboard held such deadly
explosives why not the boxes

  in that case there would be a glor-
ious skyward journey for me and the
german servant and about an acre or
two of the surrounding country
there was also the risk that the de-
tonation might set off the other bricks
in the cupboard for i had forgotten
most that i knew about lentonite

  but it didnt do to begin thinking
about the possibilities the odds
were horrible but i had to take them

  i ensconced myself just below the
sill of the window then i waited
for a moment or two there was
dead silence-only a shuffle of heavy
boots in the passage and the peaceful
cluck of hens from the warm out-of-
doors

  i commended my soul to my maker
and touched off the fuse

to be concluded next week dont forget thia magazine is issued weekly and that
you vrill get the conclusion of this story without waiting a month

dusky eyes

                 retouching was an art once used
                 exclusively on pictures

but women have preempted it
to touch up facial fixtures

until their lashes pon my soul

                      look just as if theyd shoveled coal

i he little man in the checked
cap was poring over the pas-
senger list commenting half
audibly on each name as he
pointed to it

   mrs and miss james-
no shes traveling alone
mrs james rinehart-i dont think
shes married miss edith payne no
thats a thin womans name astrid
klumpft-shes not a foreigner miss
mayme cole that might be her mrs
ethel stevens maybe she is a widow
miss lolita walsh-thats her the
name just suits her all soft and full
of curves

  he gave the purser a really good
cigar  say do you know the name
of the blond young lady who sits third
from the end on the left at the first
officers table 

  the fat girl

   no i wouldnt call her fat shes
just a little plump

   guess were not talking about the
same one t mean the whale of a
blonde that wore the roman stripe
dress last night you couldnt forget
her after you once saw her

  the little man drew closer  thats
the one im like you i just couldnt
forget her

  the purser rubbed his chin  shes
a good looker all right wait a
minute till i look her up on the list
here she is walsh miss lolita
walsh going to manila

  the little mans thin face broke
into a wrinkling smile  thats just
the name id picked out for her from
the whole list  he said excitedly

  the pursers eyes twinkled a bit
 why he asked

   it sounds just the way she looks
you know there would have to be
an    in her name somewhere she
might be lois or lulu or clara or
louise or alice but she could never
be jane or frances or hester or
edith he paused  my first wifes
name was edith

  the purser eyed his retreating back
with knowing amusement

   ive got your number skinny he
thought  youre a six-months wid-
ower looking for a change

  the little man stalked his quarry
from the saloon to the promenade
deck from the promenade deck to the
hurricane deck without once seeing
her

  she could not be ill on that smooth
sea so by natural inference he knew
she must be on deck and he stared
with painstaking care at every oc-
cupied deck chair

  at length passing a row of chairs
whose occupants were swathed in
sleep and blankets beyond recognition
he turned to watch a school of por-
poises a misstep tangled his feet in
a blanket and he fell prone upon the
sleepers

  in his wild struggles to right him-

self he fell between two deck-chairs
with his small neat feet waving in
the air where his head should have

been

goodness what was that
came shrilly from his jailer on the
left  i believe we are on the rocks
a throaty contralto chuckled from
his jailer on the right thrilled him

  no only a man thtumbled i gueth
here are hith feet hith head mutht
be under your chair jutht thtand up
a minute cant you

   my word  said the sharp-voiced
one jumping up hastily

  a soft plump white hand clutch-
ing the prisoner lifted him to his feet
he stood crimson and speechless be-
fore the object of his search

  the longer she looked at him the
harder she laughed mellow deep-
chested chuckles that shook her fat
ripplingly he had ample chance to
notice her round blue eyes her apple-
blossom complexion the light aura of
her hair her chin or more exactly
chins tipped with rose before she
could control herself

   im thorrv im tho rude she
lisped  but im not uthed to being
arouthed in jutht that way

  he marveled at the music of a lisp
issuing from red satiny lips strange
that he had never noticed before how
it enhanced the simplest phrase-a
lisp so slight that any attempt to set
it down in print must grossly exag-
gerate it

   im very sorry he stammered
 my foot must have caught

   are you hurt  

   no thanks only shaken up a bit
 he other lady having received his
apologies in acid silence retired to her
stateroom and the little man looked
questioningly at her chair  may
i  he asked

   oh yeth do if you dont mind
my telling you your cravat theemth
to be ecthited and trying to run away
and your hair needth thmoothing
down

  is that better miss walsh ho

asked boldly after repairing the rav-
ages of his spill

 her round eyes became still
rounder a thing which he would have
declared impossible  how did you
know my name  she asked

   a little bird told me he said
playfully

   mutht have been a thea-gull she
lisped  gothipping bird if you
meet him again tell him to come
around and tell me yourth

   ill save him the trouble re-
torted the little man intoxicated by
his own repartee

   my name is sloan alfred sloan
of denver

   i knew thome people from den-
ver when i was a child their name
was thteele she said  did you
know them there were two daugh-
terth

   yes-oh yes answered mr
sloan reddening unaccountably

   may married a man from port-
land-a very good match edith the
older one-let me think it theemth
to me she married thome one that
didnt amount to much didnt she
mr sloans face looked like a
radish of rosy hue  well-i dont
know she married me 

  utter consternation seized miss
walsh  oh oh- she gasped  i
mutht have mixed her up with thome-
body elth

   no i guess not said mr sloan
humbly  i never did amount to an
awful lot and edith had slim pick-
ings until my uncle died and left me
his money a year ago-edith died last
january

   well i know you were alwayth
kind and gentle with her anyway
jutht making money ithnt the only
thing in the world she consoled

  that night through the good offices
of the purser who was a kindly
youth his seat was changed to the
first officers table fourth from the
end on the left side

  the fair lolitas plump shoulders
towered above him like chalk cliffs
venus by the pound



over which her smiling face beamed
like a benevolent moon she was en-
grossed in the carte djour

   i think ill have pea puree
creamed thweetbread thmothered
chicken athparaguth candied thweet-
potatoeth and thtring beanth she
said to the waiter

   ill give the retht of the order
later oh i want potatoeth tliouffle
too dont you love potatoeth thouf-
fle mr thloan  

  mr sloan who had contemplated a
lettuce salad and a mutton-chop with
zwieback as became a man of uncer-
tain digestion gallantly decided to
duplicate the ladys order

   ill take thome too he said in-
fected with lisping then he blushed
furiously  i mean ill take some
stew he corrected there was an
audible titter  no i mean bring me
the same as the lady ordered

  lolita radiated cheering warmth
like a base-burner stove under her
cheering influence mr sloan who was
a bashful soul expanded into jest and
even querulous autobiography at the
end of two days lolita was familiar
with his frail bullied boyhood his
stormy days with the ambitious edith
whom his meek futility exasperated
into a virago and his economic failure
until his uncles legacy relieved him
he was on his way around the world
it seemed

  lolita offered  confidences in re-
turn but he noticed that in pensive
moments her broad white brow drew
into unaccustomed knots her blue eyes
clouded and all her chins quivered
pitifully

  it was more than his sympathetic
soul could bear he besought her to
confide in him

  she sighed mightily  you would
not underthtand if i did tell you she
replied  no man would but later
in the day she beckoned him myste-
riously into a secluded corner of the
saloon

   jutht look at thith she whispered
dramatically handing forth a photo-

graph of a very pretty girl  do you
know who it is 

  its haunting familiarity bewildered
him  no i dont

   look at it clothely ithnt it like
thome one you know

   it does look like some one but i
cant think who he looked up at
her hazily  sav it isnt vour sister
is it

  she dropped limply into a chair
oh ithnt it dreadful she be-
moaned  but funny too i could
die laughing over it

  and the astounding girl giggled
while mr sloan shifted uncomfortably
from one foot to the other

   that picture is me taken three
yearth ago and ive grown tho fat
that no one knowth it 

  mr sloan sprang gallantly into the
breach  why of course it is you
i should have known in a minute if
id had on my other glasses only it is
thin

  she shook her head pensively  no
not thin-im fat when that picture
wath taken i weighed a hundred and
forty now -she glanced around
warily and lowered her voice- now
i weigh two hundred and fifteen

  mr sloan swallowed hard he
weighed one hundred and thirty-seven
 wh-what started you to g-gaining 
he hazarded

   i think it wath cod-liver oil they
made me take it for a bad cold and
then i like candy and potatoeth and
pathtry and all thweet things the
wortht part of it is im going out to
manila to be married and george
cant bear fat girlth

  mr sloan winced at the news
 doesnt he know that-you have
gained 

  she shook her head  no i kept
thinking that id diet or roll or play
golf but i never got around to it he
went out lo the islandth four yearth
ago he callth me  little angel  and
 little girl 

  in the midst of her trouble she
giggled


all-story weekly

  	well said mr sloan stiffly if

be prefers scrawny scarecrows he can
have them i prefer em plump

   thcarecrowht  

   no girls

   he thent me beautiful embroidery
from the phiiippineth - heapth of
them all meant for a thirty-six model
why the waitht i have on is made
from two waitht-patternth each one
made a thleeve-luckily they were
alike-and i tilled out the retht with
plain linen

   dont you care said the gallant
sloan  dont you care the sweet-
est things grow large like sugar-cane
and watermelons and lots of things

  by the time the manchuria reached
honolulu mr sloan was the fervent
and avowed suitor of lolita with the
approval of every one from the captain
to the deck-stewards

   say he said to the orchestra
leader confidentially  cant you play
oh you beautiful doll some-
times i think thats a mighty pretty
song

   sure agreed the musician
 and wouldnt you like  youre my
great big blue-eyed baby its
somewhat the same

  they spent a happy day sightseeing
at honolulu late in the afternoon
lolita dismissed her escort with the
excuse of shopping returning just at
sailing-time puffing and flushed

   my word she panted as she came
tip the gangplank  i nearly mithed
the boat it took me an age to find
any thcaleth without a crowd hanging
around ive gained two poundth on
the trip she said pensively  are
you quick at arithmetic  if a fat lady
gainth two poundth in a week on a
thea-voyage how much will she gain
in three weekth   no dont work it
out it will make me grouchy

   i wouldnt have you any different
than you are said mr sloan and he
meant it

  she came as near to a sardonic grin
as her cupids-bow mouth would per-
mit you she said im not

worrying about you-but george he
hateth a fat girl 

   let him go then i love a fat
girl

   let him go-how can i  he and
aunt mabel will meet me at the dock
we are going to be married at her
home they will catch me coming
down the gangplank i cant get away
without jumping overboard

  then did little sloan prove himself
of heroic stuff  well if you wont
have me you might as well reduce to
suit george

  she rewarded him with a brilliant
smile-she had an adorable smile
 how shall i begin

  he produced a pencil and note-book
and in the lee of the cabin they formu-
lated an anti fat code

  diet breakfast and dinner only
rations to consist of dry toast weak
tea untrimmed green vegetables one
small piece of meat each day and no
sweets sleep six hours a night
no naps exercise three-mile sprints
around the ship

  now if i could only roll ex-
claimed lolita

   the cabin   he suggested

   umph-um thomebody forever
thnooping around

   the hurricane-deck after every
one has gone to bed  with a sly sense
of strategy in securing several hours
more of her society each evening

 great she agreed mr
thloan you are the betht friend i ever
had

  and so the epic struggle against fat
began lolita stoically stuck to her
uninteresting diet with the flesh-pots
of egypt about her

  the curtailed sleep followed as a
corollary of the nightly rollings which
were harder to accomplish than to
plan mr sloan and lolita were
astounded at the number of moon-
struck strolling couples who sprang up
like mushrooms in the night

  had they been at all inclined to gos-
sip they might have spread many an
ear-whetting item it was most dis-
venus by the pound



concerting when he had reported the
deck as deserted and she clad in her
oldest clothes was just preparing to
roll to hear you silly boy ill bet
you say that to every girl you meet
and amorous murmurings from shad-
owy corners

  when at length the last belated
insomniacs had departed mr sloan
essayed the faithful scout while lolita
rolled back and forth on the deck

   one-help me get thtarted two-
i hope they keep the deck clean three
-lordy im fagged now and i have
tc do it fifty timeth four-darn that
potht five - ive no - breath-left
thix - thith ought to-take-it-off
theven - ouch  im lame-all-over
eight -i - know -im black-and-
blue

  but by that time she had no breath
except for an occasional smothered
giggle mr sloan stood by unsmiling
and solicitous till the allotted rollings
were over

  the next morning she showed him
multicolored bruises on her white
arms  ive got more than i can
count all over me and lame it hurt
me to turn over in bed

  mr sloan fumed  oh lolita
why do you go through all this tor-
ture if you would only marry me
i wouldnt care how fat you were i
adore every single ounce of you

  lolita sighed  yeth i know but
george-do you think ive lotht any 

   i dont know im losing every
day just from the way youre treat-
ing me

  for almost three weeks they pa-
tiently followed the same program
without visibly decreasing lolitas
girth

  when at length she was able to pinch
up a few scanty wrinkles of loose cloth
in her gown and move the hooks on
her skirt he rejoiced with her until he
reflected that he was helping his rivals
cause

  after a particularly strenuous eve-
nings rolling when sudden lurches of
the ship had sent her careening into

-every post on the deck she sat down
and cried softly mr sloan sought to
comfort her after the world-old man-
ner without resistance

    lolita are you hurt 

  no answer

  poor little girl tell old alfie
whats the matter

for reply she nestled closer sob-
bing more deeply  are you crying
for fear george wont-want you
she nodded negation  umph-um-
for fear he will want me she sobbed

  it took him a full minute to get
that  dont-dont you care for
him any more 

   no no  she wept  i like you
a million timeth more

  for a brief period both of them
were too engrossed for conversation
at last he said   then youll marry
me in manila instead of george
oh mercy no gasped lolita
 george would kill you-dead you
have no idea how jcalouth he is or
what a horrible temper-

  mr sloan straightened up man-
fully  i shall tell him as soon a we
land that your feelings have changed
and he cant play leading man at your
wedding

   alfie he would throw you off the
dock she whispered shivering

   let him try-just let him

   oh alfie you are tho fool-
hardy strange sweet tribute to
mr alfred sloan  he is thix feet
tall and an amateur heavyweight he
would jutht naturally kill - in five
minuteth

  alfie shook his head in dogged be-
wilderment  its too much for me
first you were afraid he wouldnt
want you and now youre afraid he
will

  on the morning they were to land
lolita disappeared immediately after
breakfast  wait for me on the for-
ward deck she commanded  thtay
there till i come no matter how late
i am

  he waited with impatience that
gave way to anxiety when in manila


all-story weekly

bay she was not visible among the
land-eager passengers he took his
unobtrusive farewells of his ship ac-
quaintances with one eye alert for
her

  the ship docked the crowd jostled
down the gangplank and still she had
not appeared he moodily scanned
the throng on the dock in an effort to
single out george and aunt mabel
that must be they on the left-the
huge glum man and the middle-aged
florid woman at his elbow

  she was rather younger and more
coquettish than he had pictured her
in bold fancy he walked up to them
saying excuse me mr -mr-
what the deuce was georges last
name - but i merely wanted to tell
you that miss walsh and i are going
to be married she-

  his imaginary bravado suddenly
vapored off when george abruptly
turned his way with an aggressive
squaring of those terrific shoulders
he started at a touch on his elbow
a very large lady swathed in heavy
weeds stood beside him and lolitas
voice issued from behind the crape
 alfie gueth who 

   my goodness lolita what in the
world are you up to where did you
get that rig 

   from the thtewardeth would
you know me 

   i should say not 

   then i gueth george wont either
it was the only way to get by him
without a row careful now look
back as we go by and tell me what
they are doing

  she indicated the couple now among
the last on the dock whom alfie had
selected for george and aunt mabel
just as they brushed by george boomed
out in a great bass  she must be
there somewhere theres nothing
for it but to ask the captain

lolita clutched alfies arm  quick
run  she panted  before any one
can tell him call a carriage and we
n think what to do while we arc
et heaping

   theres only one thing to do
said alfie in the protection of an an-
cient victoria  we must get mar-
ried first and tell him afterward he
cant do anything then since seeing
george the idea of announcing their
engagement to him failed to attract
him

   cant do anything  said lolita
in italics  i gueth he could make me
a widow in about five minuteth well
id be mitheth thloan anyway she

beamed

  two hours later gazing too deeply
into the eyes of herbrand-new hus-
band to mind her steps lolita crashed
into a large man as she turned a
corner

  the usual recoil and apologies fol-
lowed  then she gave a hysterical
giggle while the mans face turned a
sickly green

   lolita how youre changed and
where in the world have you been
he exclaimed

  how dye do george she said
tranquilly  why didnt you meet
me

  he stammered unintelligibly and it
flashed over mr sloan that he seemed
scarcely less prepared than lolita for
the meeting

  the fact is lolita - i might as
well get it over-im a cad and all
that but my feelings have changed in
the last year since ive been going
so often to your aunts ive-that
is we-well weve come to care for
each other

  lolita stared and stared and
stared her eyes rounder every minute

 aunt mabel she murmured

  george blundered on drops of per-
spiration oozing from him in his dis-
tress

   she is a remarkable woman and
only six years older than i besides
she is-that is she has great business
ability and-please dont look at me
like that lolita im sorry if youre
disappointed but mabel said wed bet-

 in the smoke of its hundred foundries

 in the glare of its man-built canons

 is it wiser o lord and meet

 where my fathers built with pride
 when the voice of the north is calling-
 calling me back to her side

    where the moose stalk bold and free
    back to the lonely packers trail-
    which is the better for me

 in the swirl of the money-gods

 in a mart sans honor and mercy

 living each dav like the other

 following the sign-posts of men

 when the voice of the north is calling-
 ever calling me back again

    back to the wild brooks singing

     and pools where the red trout lie

    back to the red fires gleaming-
    which is it to live or to die

 in the race for show with your betters

 in an age when faith is unknown

 in the warp of the tangled threads of life
 must i reap where others have sown

 and play when the dice roll heavy

 well knowing a crooked game

 when the voice of the north is calling-
 calling me ever the same

 back to the still lakes edges

    where the deer come out to play

 back to the loons lone crying-

 which is it to go or stay

bill carmody big powerful red-blooded inheriting through his mother the
reckless strain of the fighting mckims has been going the pace on broadway
as the result of a particularly wild escapade he is disinherited by his father a cold
narrow-minded millionaire banker and dismissed with chilling contempt by his sweet-
heart ethel manton bitter and disheartened but with the avowed intention of mak-
ing good bill starts west on the way the train is wrecked and he saves a wounded
stranger from two crooks who are about to rob and murder him the stranger proves
to be h d appleton a prominent lumberman who offers bill a job either in the
woods as a lumber-jack or in the office bill chooses the woods and starts alone for
the camp of which buck moncrossen a fine lumberman but a bully and general bad
man is boss being a greener tenderfoot bill starts to walk the eighty miles of
rough forest trail between the end of the railroad and the camp without proper food
or boots and with no snow-shoes or firearms thanks to his great strength and
endurance however he wins almost through but at nightfall of the third day a pack
of wolves-led by an enormous gaunt battle and trap scarred female-that have been
trailing him for hours begin to close in threateningly enraged bill hurls his ax
among them killing one and then armed only with his knife attacks the huge leader
together they go down locked in a death grip

chapter xv
the werwolf

ow as all men know bill
carmody had done a most
foolish and insane thing

  but the very audacity of
his act - and the god of
chance - favored him for
as the ax whizzed through
the air the keen edge of the whirling
bit caught one of the larger wolves
full on the side of the head

  there followed the peculiar dull
scrunching sound that stands alone
among all other sounds being pro-
duced by no other thing than the sud-
den crush of a living skull

  the front and side of the skull lift-
ed and turned backward upon its hinge
of raw scalp and the wolf went down
clawing and biting and over the snow
flowed thick red blood and a thicker
mucus of soft wet brains

  at the sight and scent of the warm
blood the companions of the stricken
brute-the gaunt tireless leaders who
had traveled beside him in the van
and t he rag - tag and bobtail alike -
fell upon him tooth and nail and the
silence of the forest was shattered by
the blood-cry of the meat-getters

  not so the great she-wolf who de-
spised these others that fought among
themselves intent only upon the sat-
isfaction of their hunger

thi story began in he all-story weekly for may 


the promise



  her purpose in trailing this man to-
destruction was of deep vengeance
the assuagement of an abysmal hatred
that smoldered in her heart against
every individual of the terrible man
kind whose cruel traps of iron blades
of steel and leaden bullets had made
her a monstrous sexless thing feared
and unsought by mating males hated
of her own breed

  and now at the moment she had
by the cunning of her generalship de-
livered this man an easy prey to her
followers they deserted her and fell
in swinish greed upon the first meat
at hand

  so that at the last she faced her
enemy alone and the smoldering fury
of her heart blazed green from her
wicked eyes she stood tense as a
pointer every hair of her long white
coat bristlingly aquiver

  suddenly she threw back her head
pointed her sharp muzzle to the sky
and gave voice to the long - drawn
ululation which is the battle - cry of
wolves

  yet it was not the wolf-cry for
long ago the malformation of a heal-
ing throat - wound had distorted the
bell-like cry into a hideous scream
like the shriek of a soul foredamned
which quavered loud and shrill upon
the keen air and ended in a series of
quick jerks like stabs of horrible
laughter

  and then with tight-drawn lips and
jaws agape she hurled herself straight
at the throat of the stumbling man

  darkness was gathering when a
mile to the northward jake lafranz
and irish fallon who were laboring
with six big horses and a rough log
drag to break out the trail suddenly
paused to listen

  through the thin cold air rang a
sound the like of which neither had
ever heard and then as if in echo
the long - drawn wail of the great
white wolf

  i hey stared at each other white-
lipped for that last cry was a thing

      	a-s

men talked about of nights with bated
breath and deep curses neither had
heard it before-nor would either hear
it again - but each recognized the
sound instinctively as he would rec-
ognize the sound of gabriels trump

   its her  gasped lafranz  god
save us its diablesse - the loup-
garou 

   tis none other-that last but
man  man the first wan was it
a human cry or from the throat of
another of her hell-begotten breed

  without waiting to reply the
frenchman swung the big six-team in
their tracks and headed them toward
camp but irish fallon reached for
him as he fumbled at the clevis

   howld on ye frog-eater be a
man if twas human tore loose that
yell hell be the bether fer help not-
withstandin there was more av foight
nor fear in th sound

  no no no its her its dia-
blesse he crossed himself

   sure an ut is bad cess to her

  the other made a whimper of pro-
test but irish fallon reached out a
great hairy hand and shook him
roughly

all-story weekly

br-reak ye in two an dont ye fer-
git ut 

  the big irishman turned arid swung
down the tote-road the webs of his
rackets leaving a broad trail in the
snow la franz cowered upon the
snow - plow and sought refuge in
craven prayer and curses the while he
shot frightened glances into the dark-
ening forest

  he thought of cutting the horses
loose and starting them for camp at a
run but much as he feared the wer-
wolf he feared irish fallon more
for many were the tales of fallons
man-fights when his  irish was up 

  when the white wolf sprang the
man had nearly reached the snarling
pack before him scarcely six feet
away lay his ax the blade smeared
with blood and brains to which clung
stiff gray hairs

  instinctively he ducked and as the
huge form flashed past his right arm
shot out straight from the shoulder
the long clean blade entered just at
the point of the brisket and ranging
upward was buried to the haft as the
knife was torn from his grasp

  one step and the mans fingers
closed about the helve of his ax and
he whirled to meet the second on-
slaught

  but there was small need the
great brute stood still in her tracks
and with lowered head snapped and
wrenched at the thing that bit into her
very lungs

  the stag - horn plates of the pro-
truding hilt were splintered under the
clamp of the mighty jaws and the
jorig gleaming teeth made deep dents
in the brass beneath her lips red-
dened and before her the snow was
flecked with blood

  all this the man took in at a glance
without conscious impression he
gripped his weapon and sprang among
the fighting pack which ripped and
dragged at the carcass of the dead
wolf

  right and left he struck in a reck-

less fume of ferocity which spoke of
unreasoning fights in worlds of sav-
age firstlings and under the smash-
ing blows of the ax wolves went down

-	skulls split spines crushed ribs
caved in - a side at a stroke and
shoulders were cloven clean and deep
to pink sponge lungs

  as if realizing that her hurt was
mortal the great she-wolf abandoned
her attack on the knife-haft and sum-
moning her strength for a supreme
effort sprang straight into the midst
of the red shambles

  the man caught unawares went
down under the impact of her body
for one fleeting second he stared up-
ward into blazing eyes from between
wide - sprung rows of flashing fangs
the blood - dripping tongue seemed to
writhe from the cavernous throat and
the foul breath blew hot against his
face instantly his strong fingers
buried themselves in the shaggy fur
close under the hinge of the jaw
while his other hand closed about the
dented brass of the protruding knffe-
hilt

  with the whole strength of his arm
he held the savage jaws from his face
as he wrenched and twisted at the
firmly embedded knife finally it
loosened and as the thick - backed
blade was withdrawn from the wound
it was followed by spurt after
spurt of blood-bright frothy blood
straight from the lungs which gushed
hot and wet over him

  blindly he struck stabbing thrust-
ing slashing at the great form which
was pressing him deeper and deeper
into the snow again and again the
knife was turned against rib and
shoulder-blade inflicting only shallow
surface wounds

  at length a heavy straight up-
thrust encountered no obstacle of
bone and the blade bit deep and
deeper into living flesh

  as with a final effort the knife was
driven home a convulsive shiver
racked the body of the great white
wolf and with a low gurgling moan
the promise



of agony her jaws set rigid her mus-
cles stiffened and she toppled sidewise
into the snow where she lay twitching
spasmodically with glazing eyes

  bill staggered weakly to his feet
the uninjured wolves had vanished
leaving their dead upon the snow
while the wounded left flat red trails
as they sought to drag their broken
bodies to the cover of the forest

  irish fallon rounded a turn of the
tote-road he brought up sharply
and stared open-mouthed at the man
who sheath-knife in hand stood look-
ing down at an indistinct object which
lay upon the blood-trampled snow

  carmody turned and shouted a
greeting but without a word the irish-
man advanced to his side until he too
stood looking down at the thing in the
snow suddenly bills hand was
seized in a mighty grip

  man tis her an no mistake
shes done for at lasht-an blade to
fang in open foight yeve knoifed her
sure tis a gr-rand toime yeve had
altogether he said glancing at the
carcasses  wid six dead besides her
an three more as good as

  bill laughed this wolf-the big
white one-seems to enjoy a reputa-
tion then

   r-r-reputation  r-r-reputation is
ut good lord man dont ye know

an some injuns besides

   they claim shes a divil an phwin
she howls tis because some sowl has
missed th happy huntin grounds in
th dyin an shes laughin

   i dont know that i blame them
said bill  she favored me with a
vocal selection and believe me she
was no mocking-bird

   well she looks dead now
grinned fallon  but wed besht make
sure owld man frontenelle kilt her
wunst seven year back ut was over
on monish

   he shot her clean trough th neck
an dhrug her to his cabin be th tail
pie was for skinnin her flat fr th
robe shed make pie had her stretched
out phwin wid a flash an a growl she
was at um an wid wan clap av th
jaws she ripped away face an half th

   they found um wanderin blind
on th lake ice an carried um to skel-
lys phwere he died in tin days toime
av hydrophoby shnarlin an bitin at
folks till they had to chain um in th
shtoreroom

  as he spoke fallon picked up the
ax and with several well-directed
blows shattered the skull of the wer-
wolf against any possibility of a repe-
tition of the frontenelle incident

   but come man get yer rackets
an well be hittin the thrail fr camp

moncrossen

they found lafranz waiting in
fear and trembling the heavy
snow-plow was left in readiness
for the morrows trail-breaking and
the horses hitched to a rough sled and
headed for camp

  an ye say misther appleton sint
ye up to wor-rk in moncrossens
camp the two were seated on the
log bunk at the back of the sled while
the frenchman drove keeping a fear-
ful eye on the white wolf for old
man frontenelle had been his uncle

   yes he told me to report here

   dve know moncrossen 

   no

     well ye will agin shpring irish
replied dryly

 what do you mean asked bill

  irish shrugged  oi mane this he
answered  moncrossen is a har-rd
man altogether he hates a greener
he thinks no wan but an owld hand

his ijoast that in wan season hell make

   what is a birds-eye game 

  fallon glanced at him sharply
 dye mane ye dont know about th
birds-eye lie asked

   not a thing replied bill

   thin listen to me dont ye niver
say birds-eye in this camp av ye ex-
pect to winter ut out

  bill was anxious to hear more about
the mysterious birds-eye but the sled
suddenly emerged into a wide clear-
ing and irish was pointing out the va-
rious buildings of the log camp

  bright squares of light showed from
the windows of the bunk-house office
and grub-shack with its adjoining
cook-shack from the iron stovepipe of
which sparks shot skyward in a con-
tinuous shower

  fallon shouldered the wolf and ac-
companied by bill made toward the
bunk-house while the frenchman
turned the team toward the stable

   agin we git washed up supperll
be ready announced irish as he de-
posited the wolf carcass beside the
door and entered

  inside the long low room lined on
either side by a double row of bunks
were gathered upward of a hundred
men waiting the supper call

  they were big men for the most
part rough clad and unshaven many
were seated upon the edges of the
bunks smoking and talking others
grouped about the three big stoves
and the tobacco-reeking air was laden
with the rumble of throaty conversa-
tion broken here and there by the
sharp scratch of a match a loud laugh
or a deep-growled good-natured curse

  into this assembly stepped irish
the promise



fallon closely followed by bill the
sight of whose blood-stained face at-
tracted grinning attention the two
men passed the length of the room to
the wash-bench where a few loiterers
still splashed noisily at their ablutions

   heard it plain im tellin you
some one was saying  way off to
the south it sounded

   that aint no lie broke in an-
other  i hearn it myself-jest before
dark it was an i know didnt i

   they say she never laughs but she
makes a kill said one

   god i was at skellys when they
brought old man frontenelle in add-
ed a big man whose heavy beard was
shot with gray as he turned from the
stove with a shudder

   theys some injuns trappin be-
low she might of got one of them
opined a short stockily built man who
catching sight of the newcomers ad-
dressed fallon

   hey irish you was down on the
tote-road did you hear diablesse 
fallon finished drying his face upon
the coarse roller-towel and faced the
group who waited expectantly  yis
oi hear-rd her all roight replied
fallon lightly  an thin oi seed
her

  others crowded about hanging
upon his words  an thin be way
av showin me contimpt he added
 oi dhrug her a moile or more trough

  loud laughter followed this asser-
tion but not a few especially among
the older men shook their heads in
open disapproval and muttered curses
at his levity

   but me frind bill here irish
continued  cn tell ye more about
her n phwat oi kin hes new in th
woods bill is an so damned green he
knowd nayther th manein nor use av

   but wid dablish herself moind

phwin tis over an he picks himsilf up
out av th shnow an wipes th blood
from his eyes - her blood - fy he

  fallon gazed triumphantly into the
incredulous faces of the men and
with a smile added  twas thin oi
dhrug her be th tail to th sled afther
shmashin her head wid th ax to make
sure

  an where is she now irish
mocked one  did she jump off the
sled an make a getaway  

  over at the grub shack the cooks
half-breed helper beat lustily upon the
discarded saw-blade that hung sus-
pended by a wire and the men crowd-
ed noisily out of the doors

   oill show ye afther supper ye
damned shpalpeen how much av her
got away  shouted irish who waited
for bill to remove the evidence of his
fight before piloting him to the grub
shack

  a single table of rough lumber cov-
ered with brown oilcloth extended the
full length of the center of the room
above this table six huge  chicago
burners  lighted the interior which
as the two men entered was a hive of
noisy activity

  alen scuffled for places upon the sta-
tionary benches arranged along either
side of the table heavy porcelain
thumped the board and the air was
filled with the metallic din of steel
knives and forks being gathered into
bearlike hands


all-story weekly

  up and down the wide alleys behind
the benches hurried flunkies bearing
huge tin pots of steaming coffee and
the incessant returning of thick cups
to their saucers was like the rattle of

musketry

  but the thing that impressed the
half-famished bill was the profusion
of food never in his life he thought
had he beheld so tempting an array of
things to eat great trenchers of fried
pork swimming in its own grease al-
ternated the full length of the table
with huge pans of baked beans

  mountains of light snowy bread
rose at short intervals from among
foot-hills of baked potatoes steaming
dishes of macaroni and stewed toma-
toes canned corn peas and apple
sauce and great yellow rolls of butter
into which the knives of the men skived
deeply

  the two passed behind the benches
in search of vacant places when sud-
denly an undersized flunky stumbled
awkwardly dropping the coffee-pot
which sent a wash of steaming brown
liquid over the floor

  instantly a great hulking man with
a w ide flat face and low forehead sur-
mounted by a thick thatch of black
hair below which two swinish eyes
scintillated unevenly paused in the act
of raising a great calk-booted foot over
the bench

  the thick pendulous lips under his
ragged mustache curled backward
exposing a crenate row of jagged
brown teeth he stepped directly in
front of the two men and reaching
out a thick hand caught the unfor-
tunate flunky by the scruff as he re-
gained his balance

  from his lips poured an unbroken
stream of vile epithets and soul-sear-
ing curses while he shook the whim-
pering wretch with a violence that
threatened serious results and ended
by pinning him against the log wall
and drawing back his huge arm for a
terrific shoulder blow

  the vicious brutality of the attack
following so trivial an offense aroused

bill carmodys anger the mans
back was toward him and bill grasped
the back-drawn arm at the wrist and
with an ungentle jerk whirled the

other in his tracks

  the man released the flunky and
faced him with a snarl  who done
that he roared

   i did hit me i tripped him

  bills voice was dead level and low
but it carried to the farthest reaches
of the room over which had fallen a
silence of expectation men saw that
the hard gray eyes of the stranger
narrowed ominously

  an who the hell are you the
words whistled through the bared
teeth and a flush of fury flooded the
mans face

   what do you care i tripped him
hit me and the owt level tone
blended into silence it seemed a
thing-that uncanny silence when
noise should have been

  there were sounds-sounds that no
one heeded nor heard-the heavy
breathing of a hundred men waiting
for something to happen-the thin
creak of the table boards as men
leaned forward upon hands whose
knuckles whitened under the red skin
and stared fascinated at the two big
men who faced each other in the broad
aisle

  the swinish eyes of the brutish
man glared malignantly into the gray
eyes of the stranger in which there
appeared no slightest flicker of rage
nor hate nor any other emotion

  only a cold hard stare which held
something of terrible intensity accen-
tuated by the little fans of whitening
wrinkles which radiated from their
corners

  in that instant the others gaze wa-
vered he knew that this man had
lied and he knew that every man in
the room knew that he had lied that
he had -deliberately lied into the row
and then without raising his guard
had dared him to strike

  it was inconceivable

  had the man loudly shouted his
the promise



challenge or thrown up his guard
w hen he dared him to strike or had
his eye twitched or burned with anger
he would have unhesitatingly lunged
into a fight to the finish

  but he found himself at a disad-
vantage he was up against some-
thing he did not understand the
calm assurance of the stranger - his
fists were not doubled and his lips
smiled-disconcerted him

  a strange prickly chill tingled at
the back of his neck and in his heart
he knew that for the first time in his
life he dared not strike a man he
cast about craftily to save his face and
took his cue from the others smile
with an effort his loose thick lips
twisted into a grin

   cxwan with yer jokin stranger
he laughed  yu damn near made
me mad-fer a minute and he turned
to the table

  instantly a clatter of noise broke
forth men rattled dishes nervously
in relief or disappointment and the
room was filled with the rumble of
voices in unmeaning chatter but in
the quick glances which passed from
man to man there was much of mean-
ing

   god man that was moncrossen  
whispered fallon when the two found
themselves seated near the end of the
table bill smiled

   was it  he asked  i dont like
him

chapter xvii

a two-fisted man

a half-hour later when bill
sought out the boss in the little
office the latter received him in
surly silence and as he read apple-
tons note his lip curled

   so you think youll make a lum-
ber-jack do you  

  yes there was no hesitation
nothing of doubt in the reply

   my crews full the boss growled

glared at the younger man  you

  bill smiled as the scowling man
crushed the note in his hand and
slammed it viciously into the wood-
box

right ill break you agin spring

woods youll run every time you hear

off the corner with a jerk

a full stop and thats my business-
see   as moncrossen encountered
the level stare of the gray eyes he
leered knowingly


all-story weekly

  oh thats it eh all right bill
 curiosity killed the cat as the feller
says an just dont forget to remem-
ber that what a man dont know dont
hurt him none

    loggin is learned in the chop-
ping accidents happens an dead
men tells no tales them that keeps
their eyes to the front an minds their
own business genally winters through
thats all

  bill wondered at the seemingly ir-
relevant utterances of the boss but left
the office without comment

  on the floor of the bunk-house irish
fallon assisted by several of the men
was removing the skin from diablesse
while others looked on

  the awkward hush that fell upon
them as he entered told bill that he
had been the subject of their conver-
sation men glanced at him covertly
as though taking his measure and he
soon found himself relating the ad-
ventures of the trail to an apprecia-
tive audience which grinned approval
and tendered flasks which he declined

  later as he helped fallon nail the
wolfskin to tbe end of the bunk-house
he told him of the interview with mon-
crossen the irishman listened
frowning

   yeve made a bad shtar-rt wid
uni he said shaking his head  ye
eyed im down in th grub shack an
he hates ye fer ut how ye got by
wid ut oi dont know ter hes a
scr-rapper from away back an av hed

ness-only kape wan eye behint ye to

  the irishman grinned

   oi thoucht so an may god have
mercy on yer sowl

   what is the matter with the

swede 

   mather enough bein hand an
glove wid moncrossen is good ray son
to suspicion any man fer tis be the
help av shtromberg that moncrossen
kapes a loine on th men an gits by

   he aint long on brains nohow

   be bluff an bullyin he gits th

yell git along wid him as well as an-
other but moind ye phwin th
birds-eye shtar-rts movin ye dont no-
tice nothin or some foine aven in
yell turn up missin

   wtiat is this birds-eye thing
asked bill  wtiat has it got to do
with moncrossen-and me  

  the irishman considered the ques-
tion and without answering walked
to the corner of the bunk-house near
which they were standing and peered
into the black shadow of the wall ap-
parently satisfied he returned again to
where bill was standing

   come on in th bunk-house now
he said  i want to locate shtrom-
berg an wan or two more well sit
around an shmoke a bit an phwin
they begin rollin in yell ask me
plnvere is th van fer ye must have
blankets an phwat not oill go along
to show ye an well take a turn down
th tote-road phwere we cn talk wid-
out its gittin to th ears av th boss
wondering at the mans precautions
for secrecy he followed and for a
half-hour listened to the fireside gos-
sip of the camp he noticed that fal-
the promise



ions glance traveled over the various
groups as if seeking some one and he
wondered which of the men was
stromberg

  suddenly the door was flung open
and a huge yellow-bearded man
stamped noisily to the stove disre-
garding the curses that issued from
the bunks of those who had already
turned in

  this man was larger even than
moncrossen with protruding eyes of
china blue which stared weakly from
beneath heavy straw-colored eyebrows
two hundred and fifty pounds thought
bill as the man snorting disagreeably
paused before him and fixed him with
an insolent stare

   hey you boss says you swamp
for me he snorted bill nodded in-
differently

   you know how to swamp good 
he asked bill studied the toes of his
moccasins and without looking up re-
plied with a negative shake of his head

   i learn you all right in couple
days you swamp good or i fix you

  bill looked up encountered the wa-
tery glare of the blue eyes and re-
turned his gaze to the points of his
moccasins the voice of the swede
grew more aggressive he snorted
importantly as the men looked on and
smote his palm with a ponderous fist

   first thing i duck you in water-
hole then i slap you to peak an
break off the peak the men snick-
ered and stromberg emboldened by
the silence of his new swamper con-
tinued 

   its time boys was in bed to-
morrow i make you earn your wages

  bill rose slowly from his seat and
as he looked again into the face of the
big swede his lips smiled but fallon
noticed and others that in the steely
glint of the gray eyes was no hint of
smile and they watched curiously
while he removed his mackinaw and
tossed it carelessly onto the edge of a
near-by bunk from where it slipped
unnoticed to the floor

  stromberg produced a bottle drank

deep and returned the flask to his
pocket he rasped the fire from his
throat with a harsh grating sound
drew the back of his hand across his
mouth and kicked contemptuously at
the mackinaw which lay almost at his
feet

  as he did so a long thick envelope
to which was tightly bound the photo-
graph of a girl slipped from the inner
pocket instantly he stooped and
seized it

  haw haw he roared the
greeners got a woman look shes
a-

   drop that  the voice was low
almost soft in tone but the words cut
quick and clear with no hint of gen-
tleness

   come get it greener  the man
taunted as he doubled a huge fist and
held the photograph high that the
others might see

  bill came he covered the inter-
vening space at a bound springing
swiftly and straight - as panthers
spring and as his moccasined feet
touched the floor he struck once
twice thrice-and all so quickly that
the onlookers received no sense of re-
peated effort

  the terrific force of the well-placed
blows and their deadly accuracy
seemed to be consecutive parts of a
single continuous smoothly flowing
movement

  in the tense silence sounds rang
sharp - the peculiar smack of living
flesh hard hit as the first blow landed
just belowt the ear the dull thump of
a heavy body blow and the clash of
teeth driven against teeth as the sag-
ging jaw of the big swede snapped
shut to the impact of the long swing
that landed full on his chins point

  the huge form stiffened spun half-
way around and toppled sidewise
against a rack of drying garments
which fell with a crash to the floor

  without so much as a glance at the
ludicrously sprawled figure bill picked
up his mackinaw and returned the en-
velope to the pocket

   irish he asked  where is the
van i must get some blankets my
nurse there says its time to turn in

   oill go wid ye said fallon and
a roar of laughter followed them out
into the night

 birds-eye  and philosophy

bill quickly made his purchases
and shouldering the roll of blan-
kets followed irish to the head
of a roll way where the two seated
themselves on the bunk of a log sled

   oi dont know how ye done ut

   uts loike this here an yon in

the promise



  irish thoughtfully tamped his pipe-
bowl and the flare of the match be-
tween his cupped palms brought out
his honest features distinctly in the
darkness bill felt a strong liking for
this homely philosopher and he lis-
tened as the other eyed him knowingly
and continued

   tis be experience we lear-rn an
th sooner a man lear-rns th bether
ut is fer um that all women know
more thin they let on-an theyve al-
ways an ace fer a whole car-rd bekase

   phwin a man fools a woman lies
a fool-fer she aint fooled at all but
she aint fool enough to let on she aint

as she knows more thin he thinks she

  fallon arose consulted his watch
and led the way toward the bunk-
house

crossen hates ye he continued  he

   i am much obliged fallon for

quietly  but inasmuch as i am work-
ing for appleton i will just make it
my business to look after his interests
in whatever way possible i guess i
will take a hand in the birds-eye game
myself i am not afraid of moncros-
sen and his gang of thieves anyway

  fallon shrugged

a frame-up

in the days that followed bill threw
himself into the work with a vigor
that won the approval of the men
a  top  lumber crew is a smooth-
running machine of nice balance whose
working units are interdependent one
upon another for efficiency one
shirking or inexperienced man may
appreciably curtail the output of an
entire camp and breed discontent and
dissatisfaction among the crew but
with bill there was no soldiering he
performed a mans work from the
start-awkwardly at first but with the
mastery of detail acquired under the
able tutelage of stromberg he became
known as the best swamper  the job

  between him and the big swede ex-
isted a condition of armed neutrality
neither ever referred to the incident
of the bunk-house nor did either show
hint of ill-feeling toward the other
the efficiency of each depended upon
the efforts of the other and neither
found cause for complaint

  with the crew working to capacity
to supply appletons demand for ten
million feet of logs there was little
time for recreation nevertheless bill


all-story weekly

bought a pair of snow-shoes from a
passing indian and in spite of rough
weather and aching muscles utilized
stormy days and moonlight nights in
perfecting himself in their use

  he and fallon had become great
chums and contrary to the irishmans
prediction instead of hectoring the
new man moncrossen left him severe-
ly alone

  and so the routine of the camp went
on until well into february the
clearing widened the timber line re-
ceded and tier upon tier of logs was
pyramided upon the rollways as yet
bill had made no progress-formu-
lated no definite plan for the detection
and ultimate exposure of the gang of
birds-eye thieves

  occasionally men put up at the camp
for a short stay creed and lebolt
were the most frequent visitors but
neither gave evidence of being other
than he appeared to be-creed a
hunter seeking to dispose of venison
taken out of season and lebolt a com-
pany cruiser engaged in estimating
timber to the northward

  it was about this time that bad
luck that gaunt specter that lurks
unseen in the shadows and hovers over
the little lives of men for the working
of harm swooped down upon the camp
and in a series of untoward happenings
impaired its efficiency and impregnated
the atmosphere with the blight of dis-
content

  an unprecedented thaw set in
ruining the skidways and reducing the
snow of the forest to a sodden slush
that chilled men to the bone as they
maundered heavily about their work

  reed and kantochy twro sawyers
were caught by a  kick-back one
of the best horses was sweenied a
teamster who fell asleep on the top
of his load awoke in the bottom of a
ravine with a shattered arm a dead
horse and a ruined log-sled bills
foot was mashed by a rolling log and
last and most far-reaching in its ef-
fect the cook contracted spotted fever
and died in a reverse curve

  moncrossen raged from a steady
eighty thousand feet a day the output
dropped to seventy sixty fifty thou-
sand-and the end was not in sight
good-natured-banter and friendly tus-
sles among the men gave place to
surlv bickering and ugly fist-fighting
and in spite of the best efforts of the
second cook the crew growled sullenly
or openly cursed the grub

  then it was that moncrossen knew
that something must be done-and that
something quickly he shifted strom-
berg and fallon to the sawing crew
made a skidder out of a swamper and
filled his place with a grub-shack
flunky

  then one afternoon he dropped in
upon bill in the bunk-house where
that young man sat fuming at his in-
action with his foot propped up on the
edge of a bunk

  hows the foot growled the
boss

    pretty sore answered bill laying
aside a magazine  swelling is going
down a bit

    ever handle horses 

    yes a few

   the boss cleared his throat and pro-
ceeded awkwardly

    i dont like to ask no crippled man
to work before hes able he began
grudgingly  but things is gohv bad
what with them two pilgrims that
called theirselves sawyers not bein
able to dodge a kickback an gibson
pickin a down - hill pull on an iced
skidway for to go to sleep on his load
an your gettin pinched an the cook
curlin up an dyin on us an the whole
damned outfit roarin about the grub
theres hell to pay all around

   he paused and receiving no answer
shot a crafty look at the man before
him

  now if you was able he went
on  you cd take the tote-sled down
to hilarity an fetch us a cook it
seems like thats the onliest wray
there aint nary nother man i cn spare
-an hes a good cook old daddy
dunnigan is if hell come hes a in-
the promise



dependent old cuss-work if he damn
good an feels like it an if he dont
he wont

   if you think you cn tackle it ill
have the blacksmith whittle you out a
crutch an you cn take that long-
geared tote team an make hilarity in
two days theys double time in it for
you he added as a matter of special
inducement

  bill did not hesitate over his deci-
sion

  all right i think i can manage
he said  when do i start 

   the team ml be ready early in the
mornin if you start about four
oclock you cn make meltons old
no  camp by night without crowd-
in em too hard its the first one of
them old camps you strike and you cn
stable the horses without unliarnessin
just slip off the bridles an feed em

  bill nodded at the door mon-
crossen halted and glanced at him
peculiarly

   im obliged to you he said  for
a greener youve made a good hand
i ll have things got ready

  bill was surprised that the boss had
paid him even this grudging compli-
ment and as he sat beside the big stove
puzzled over the peculiar glance that
had accompanied it

  in a few minutes however he dis-
missed the matter and turned again to
his six months old magazine could
he have followed moncrosscn and
overheard the hurried conversation
which took place in the little office he
would have found food for further
reflection but of this he remained in
ignorance and all unknown to him
a man left the office slipped swiftly
and noiselessly into the forest and
headed southward

   tis a foine va-acation yere havin
playin nurse fer a pinched toe an me
tearin out th bone fer to git out th
logs on salt - horse an dough - gods t
wd sink a battle-ship tis a lucky
divil ye ar-re altogither railed fallon
good-naturedly as he returned from
supper and found bill engaged in

the task of swashing arnica on his
bruised foot

    oh i dont know ill be back in
the game to-morrow

  to-morry exclaimed irish
eying the swollen and discolored mem-
ber with a grin  yis ut  be to-
morry all right but tis a shame to
waste so much toime av ye cd git
th boss to put ye on noight shift icin
th skidways ye wudnt have to wait

	 its a fact irish laughed bill

    he didnt tell me to go pie is

asked me if i thought i could make it
irish pulled thoughtfully at his pipe
and slowly his brows drew together in
a frown

   he said ye cd make ut in two
days he inquired

    yes the tote road is well bro-
ken and forty miles traveling light
with that rangy team is not such an
awful pull

   an he to wid ye phwere to camp
itll be meltons awld not  where ye
camped cornin in

  w yes

  fallon nodded thoughtfully and
bill wondered what was passing in his
mind for a long time he was silent
and the injured man responded to the
hearty greetings and inquiries of the
men returning from the grub shack

  when these later had disposed them-
selves for the evening the irishman
hunched his chair closer to the bunk
upon which bill was sitting

   at meltons no  oi inoind
th shtables is a good bit av a way
from th rist av th buildins an hid
from soight be a knowl av ground

   i dont remember the stables but
they cant be very far they are in the

blacksmith make me a crutch

  f a crutch is ut a crutch well
a man ud play hell makin foorty

   why th man was a greener an

  bill followed the irishman closely
and knew that he spoke with a pur-

pose his eyes narrowed and his lips
bent into that cold smile which the

men of the camp had come to know
was no smile at all but a battle alarum
the more ominous for its silence

   do you mean that it is a frame-
up that moncrossen- fallon si-
lenced him with a motion

chapter xx

a fire in the night

the sledding was good on the tote-
road

the thaw that ruined the iced
surface of the sideways was followed
by several days of freezing weather
that put a hard smooth finish on the
deep snow of the longer road over
which the runners of the box-bodied
tote-sled slipped with scarcely any re-
sistance to the pull of the sharp-shod
team

  bill carmody snugly bundled in
robes in the bottom of the sled idly
watched the panorama of tree-trunks
between which the road twisted in an
endless succession of tortuous wind-
ings
the promise



  it was not yet daylight when lie
rounded the bend which was the scene
of his fight with the were-wolf

  but by the thin cold starlight and
the pale luminosity of the fading au-
rora he recognized each surrounding
detail and wondered at the accuracy
with which the trivialities of the set-
ting had been subconsciously impressed
upon his memory

  it was here he had first met fallon
and he remembered the undisguised
approval in the irishmans voice and the
firm grip of the hand that welcomed
him into the comradery of the north-
men as he stood faint from hunger
and weary from exertion staring dully
down at the misshapen carcass of
diablesse

   good old irish he muttered and
smiled as he thought of himself bill
carmody proud of the friendship of a
lumber-jack

  he had come to know that in the
ceaseless whirl of society the heavier
timbers-the real men are thrown
outward-forced to the very edges of
the bowl where they toil among big
things upon the outskirts of civiliza-
tion

  he pulled off his heavy mitten and
fumbled for his pipe in the side-
pocket of his mackinaw his hand en-
countered an object-hard and cold
and unfamiliar to his touch

  he withdrew it and looked at the
wicked blue-black outlines of an auto-
matic pistol idly he examined the
clip crowded with shiny yellow cart-
ridges he recognized the gun as
fallons and smiled as he returned it
to his pocket

   only in case of a pinch he
grinned and glanced approvingly at
the fist that doubled hard to the strong
clinch of his fingers

  hour after hour lie slipped smoothly
southward relieving the monotony of
the journey by formulating his plan
of action in case the forebodings of
fallon should be realized

  personally he apprehended 
trouble but he made up his mind that

trouble coming should not find him un-
prepared

  when at last the team swung into
the clearing of meltons old number
eight the stars winked in cold bril-
liance above the surrounding pines and
the deserted buildings stood lifeless
and dim in the deepening gloom

  bill headed the horses for the stable
which he found as irish had told him
located at some distance from the other
buildings and cut off from sight by a
knoll and a heavy tangle of scrub that
had sprung up in the clearing

  he climbed stiffly and painfully from
the sled-box and with the aid of his
crutch hobbled about the task of un-
hitching the horses he watered them
where a plume of thin vapor dis-
closed the whereabouts of a never-
freezing spring which burbled softly
between its low ice-encrusted banks

  it proved a difficult matter crippled
as lie was to handle the horses but at
length he got them into the stable
chinked the broken feed-boxes as best
he could and removed the bridles
hanging them upon the liames

  he closed the door and securing
his lantern blankets and lunch-basket
made his wav toward the old shack
where he spent his first night in the
timber land

  the sagging door swung half open
and upon the rough floor the snow-
water from the recent thaw had collect-
ed in puddles and frozen rendering
the footing precarious

  bill noted with satisfaction that
there still remained a goodly portion
of the firewood which he had cut and
carried in upon his previous visit and
he soon had a fire roaring in the rusty
stove

  he was in no hurry he knew that
any attempt to make away with the
team would be delayed until the thief
believed him to be asleep and his plans
were laid to the minutest detail

  setting the lantern upon the table
he proceeded to eat his lunch after
which he lighted his pipe and for an
hour smoked at the fireside in spite


all-story weekly

of the pain of his injured loot his
mind wandered back to the events of
his first visit to the shack

  there in the black shadow of the
pile of firewood lay the empty whisky-
bottle where the indian had tossed it
after drinking the last drop of its con-
tents	

  carmody stared a long time at this
silent reminder of his first serious
brush with king alcohol then from
the inner pocket of his mackinaw he
drew the sealed packet and gazed for
many minutes at the likeness oi the
girl-dimming now from the rub of
the coarse cloth of the pocket

  suddenly a great longing came over
him-a longing to see this girl to hear
the soft accents of her voice and above
all to tell her of his great love for her
that in all the world there was no
woman but her and that each day and
a hundred times each day her dear
face was before his eyes and in his
ears ringing above the mighty sounds
of a falling forest was the soft sweet
sound of her voice

  he could not speak to her but she
could speak to him even if it was but
a repetition of the words of the letters
he already knew by heart but which
had remained sealed in the envelope
ever since the day he bid farewell to
broadway-and to her

  his fingers fumbled at the flap of
the heavy envelope he could at least
feast his eyes upon the lines traced by
her pen and press his lips to the page
where her little hand had rested

   his foot throbbed with dull persist-
ence he was conscious of being
tired but he must not sleep this night
rough work possibly at any rate a
mans work awaited him there in the
gloom of the silent clearing

  again his eye sought the whisky-
bottle and held his fingers ceased to
toy with the flap for in that moment
the thought came to him that had the
bottle not been empty had it been filled
with liquor-strong liquor-with the
pain in his foot and the stiffness of
his tired muscles and the work ahead

-well he might-for the old desire
was strong upon him-he might take
a drink

   not yet he muttered and re-
turned the packet to his pocket un-
opened  i told her i would beat the
game ive bucked old john barley-
corns line ami scored a touchdown
the hardest of the fighting is past but
there is just a chance that i might miss
goal

   bill looked at his watch it was eight
oclock he stood up wincing as his
injured foot touched the floor and
hobbled across the room where he
wrenched a rough split shelf from the
wall this together with some sticks
of firewrood he rolled in a blanket
placing it near the stove he added
more wood until the bundle was about
the size and shape of a man and
covered it with his other two blankets
filling the broken stove with wood he
blew out the lantern and limped silently
out into the night

  two hours later creed birds-eye
spotter and bad man of the worn-out
little town of hilarity knocked the
ashes from his pipe and held a glowing
brand to the dial of his watch

   the greener should be asleep by
now he muttered and rolling his
blanket kicked snow over the rem-
nant of his camp-fire picked up his
rifle and ascended the steep side of a
deep ravine ling some two hundred
yards to the westward of the clearing
where bill carmody had encamped
for the night

  after leaving moncrossens office
on the previous afternoon he had
traveled all night and reached meltons
old number eight in the early mor-
ning

   all day he had slept by the side of
his fire in the bottom of the ravine
and in the evening had lain in the
cover of the scrub and watched the
greener stable the horses and limp to
the deserted shack

  at heart creed was a craven a
bullying swashbuckler who bragged
and blustered among the rheumy-eyed
the promise-



down-and-outers who nightly fore-
gathered about burrages stove but
who was servile and cringing as a
starved puppy toward moncrossen and
stromberg who openly despised him

  they made good use of his ability
to  spot  a birds-eye tree as far as
he could see one however an ability
shared by few woodsmen and which
in creed amounted almost to genius

  the man had never been known to
turn his hand to honest work but as
a timber pirate and pedler of rotgut
whisky among the indians he had
arisen to comparative affluence

  his hate for the greener was abys-
mal and unreasoning and had been
carefully fostered by moncrossen who
instinctively fearing that the new man
would eventually expose his nefarious
double-dealing with his employer re-
alized that at the proper time creed
could be induced to do away with the
greener under circumstances that would
leave him moncrossen free from sus-
picion

  in the framing of bill carmody
stromberg had no part moncrossen
could not fathom the big swede upon
whose judgment and acumen he had
come to rely in the matter of handling
and disposing of the stolen timber

  several times during the winter he
had tentatively broached plans and in-
sinuated means whereby the swede
could  accidentally  remove his
swamper from their path

  the reversing of a hook which
would cause a log to roll just at the
right time on a hillside the filing of
a link the snapping of a weakened
bunk-pin any one of these common ac-
cidents would render them safe from
possible interference

  but to all these suggestions strom-
berg turned a deaf ear the boss even
taunted him with the knock-out he had
received at the hands of the greener

   thats all right moncrossen he
replied  i picked the fight purpose to
beat him up it didnt work hes a
better man than me-or you either-
an you know it only he had to lick

     	a-s

me to prove it he chilled your heart
with a look an a grin-an the whole

crew lookin on

   but beatin up a man is one thing
an murder is another appletons
rich besides hes a softwood man an
aint fixed for handlin veneer so i
mights well get in on the birds-eye
as let yon an creed an lebolt steal it
all

   but i aint got to the point where
id murder a good man to cover up
my dirty tracks-an i never will 

  nd so without consulting strom-
berg moncrossen bided his time and
laid his plans and now the time had
come the plan had been gone over
in detail in the little office and creed
in the edge of the timber stood ready
to carry it out

  stealthily he slipped into the dense
shadows of the scrub and made his
way toward the shack where a thin
banner of smoke shot with an occa-
sional yellow spark floated from the
dilapidated stovepipe that protruded
from the roof

  the hard crust rendered snow-shoes
unnecessary and his soft moccasins
made no sound upon the surface of
the snow

  gaining the side of the shack he
peered between the unchinked logs
the play of the firelight that shone
through the holes of the broken stove
sent flickering shadows dancing over
the floor and walls of the rough in-
terior

  near the fire stretched long and
silent beneath its blankets lay the
form of a man creed shifted his
position for a better view of the
sleeper his foot caught in the loop
of a piece of discarded wire whose
ends were firmly frozen into the snow
and he crashed heavily backward into
a pile of dry brushwood

  it seemed to the frightened man as
if the accompanying noise must wake
the dead he lay for a moment where
he had fallen listening for sounds
from within he clutched his rifle
nervously but the deathlike silence


all-story weekly

was unbroken save for his own heavy
breathing and the tiny snapping of
the fire in the stove

  cautiously he extricated himself
from the brush-heap his heart pound-
ing wildly at the snapping of each dry
twig it was incredible that the man
could sleep through such a racket in
a country where life and death may
hang upon the rustle of a leaf

  but the silence remained unbroken
and after what seemed to the cower-
ing man an eternity of expectant
waiting he crawled again to the wall
and glanced furtively into the interior
the form by the fire was motionless
as before-it had not stirred

  then as he looked a ray of fire-
light fell upon the white label of the
black whisky bottle that lay an easy
arms reach from the head of the
sleeper a smile of comprehension
twisted the lips of his evil face as he
leered through the crevice at the help-
less form by the fireside

   soused to the guards he sneered
 an me with ten years scairt offen
my life fer fear id wake him he
stood erect and with no attempt at
the stealth with which he had ap-
proached the shack proceeded rapidly
in the direction of the stable

  it was but the work of a few mo-
ments to bridle the horses lead them
out and hitch them to the sled

  tossing the horse - blankets on top
of the big tarpaulin which lay in the
rear of the sled-box ready for use in
the covering of supplies he settled
himself in front and pulled the robes
about him

  he turned the team slowly onto the
tote - road and glanced again toward
the shack a spark larger than the
others shot out of the stoyepipe and
lodged upon the bark roof where it
glowed for a moment before going
out the man watched it in sudden
fascination

  he halted the team and stared long
at the spot where the spark had van-
ished in blackness but which in the
brain of the man appeared as an ever-

widening circle of red which spread
until it included the whole roof in its
fiery embrace and crept slowly down

the log walls

  so realistic was the picture that he
seemed to hear the crackle and roar
of the leaping flames he drew a
trembling hand across his eyes and
when he looked again the shack stood
silent and black in the half light of
the starlit clearing

  god he mumbled aloud if
it had only happened thataway-
he passed his tongue over his dry
thick lips why not he ar-
gued querulously  moncrossen said
twant safe to bushwhack him like i
wanted to-said how i aint got nerve
nor brains to stand no investigation

  but if hed git burnt up in the
shack thats safer yet he got that
booze somewhere - some one knows
he had it he got spiflicated built a
roarin fire in the old stove-an there
yare plain as daylight no brains
ill show him whos got brains -
an there wont be no investigation
neither

  he drew the team to the side oi
the tote-road and slipping the halters
over the bridles tied them to a stout
sapling and made his way toward the

shack

  one look satisfied him that the
sleeper had not stirred and noiseless-
ly he slipped the heavy hasp of the
door over the staple and secured it
with the wooden pin

  he collected dry branches piling
them directly beneath the small square
window which yawned high in the
wall higher and higher the pile
grew until its top was almost on a
level with the sill

  his hands trembled as he applied the
match tiny tongues of flame strug-
gled upward through the branches
lengthening and widening as fresh
twigs ignited and in his ears the
crackle and snap of the dry wood
sounded as the rattle of musketry

  his first impulse as the flames gained
headway was to fly-to place distance
the promise



between himself and the scene of his
crime but he dared not go his
knees shook and he stared with
blanched face in horrid fascination as
the flames roared and crackled through
the brushwood

  they were curling about the win-
dow now and the whole clearing was
light as day he slunk around the
corner and gained the shadow of the
opposite wall fearfully he applied
his eye to a crevice-the form by the
stove had not moved

  the air of the interior was heavy
with smoke and tiny flames were eat-
ing their way between the logs the
smoke thickened blurring and blotting
out the prostrate figure he glanced
across at the window its aperture
was a solid sheet of flame - he was
safe

  with a low animal-like cry creed
sprang away and dashed in the direc-
tion of the team with shaking fin-
gers he clawed at the knots and slipped
the halters

  leaping into the sled he grabbed
up the lines and headed the horses
southward at a run behind him the
sky reddened as the flames licked hun-
grily at the dry logs of the shack

   its his own fault its his own
fault he mumbled over and over
again  serves him right fer gittin
soused an buildin up a big fire in a
busted stove twasnt no fault of
his that spark didnt catch the roof
serves him right maybe it did catch
-maybe it did taint my fault no-
how - it must v caught - i seen it
thataway so plain oh my god oh
my god he babbled  if they git to
askin me

    it was thisaway mister yes sir
listen i was camped in the ravine
an all to wunst i seen the flare of the
fire an i run over there but twas too
late-the roof had fell in an the pore
feller must v been cooked alive it
was tumble mister-tumble

   an i run an hitched up the team
an druv to hilarity hell bent fer a
potlatch-thats the way of it-selp

me god it is if yon dont blieve it
ask moncrossen - ask moncrossen i
mean if he didnt have no booze along

-	he must a been drunk - an him
crippled thataway

  oh lordy lordy i aint sup-
posed to know it was the greener let
alone he was crippled im all mixed
up aready they better not go askin
me questions lessen they want to git
me hung - godamity id ort to
done like moncrossen said

  so he raved in a frenzy of terror
as the horses sped southward at a pace
that sent the steam rising in clouds
from their heaving sides

  and under the big tarpaulin in the
rear of the sled-box the greener
grinned as he listened and eyed the
gibbering man through a narrow slit
in the heavy canvas

chapter xxi

daddy dunnigan

it was broad daylight when creed
pulled the team up before a tum-
bled-down stable in the rear of one
of the outstraggling cabins at the end
of hilaritys single street hastily he
unhitched and led the horses through
the door

  as lie disappeared bill slipped from
under the canvas and limped stiffly
around the corner of the stable and
none too soon for as creed returned
to the sled for the oats and blankets
the cabin door opened and a tall an-
gular woman appeared carrying an
empty water-pail

   so yeve come back hev ye   she
inquired in a shrewish voice  well
yere jest in time to fetch the water
an wood wtiere dye git that rig
she added sharply eying the sled

   none o yer damn business an

 git back from burrages er i ii rig

   yeh is that so jest you lay a
finger on me you damn timber-thiev-

over the head with the peaked end of
a flatiron where ye goin ter hide
when the owner of them team comes
a huntin of em ha ha ha

   shet up  growled the man so
shortly that the woman eying him
narrowly turned toward the rickety
pump which burbled and wheezed as
she worked the handle filling the pail
in spasmodic splashes

   one of moncrossens teamsters
got burnt up in the shack at meltons
no  an i found the team in the
stable an druv em in he vouchsafed
as he brushed by the woman on his
way to the street  twouldnt look
right if i shet up about it ill be back
when i tell burrage

   fetch some bacon with ve called
the woman as she filled her dirty
apron with chips she paused before
lifting the pail from the spout of the
wooden pump and gazed speculatively
at the tote-sled

   hes lyin she said aloud  hes
up to some fresh devilment an pears
like hes scairt trouble with creed
is he aint got no nerve - hes all
mouth i sure was hard up fer a man
when i tuk him - but he treats me
middlin kind an id kind of hate to
see him git caught - cause he aint
no good a liar an a man anvways
smartd mix him up in a minit

  she lifted the pail and pushed
through the door of the cabin

   nice people muttered bill as he
cast about for an exit

  keeping the stable in line with the
window of the cabin he made his
way through a litter of tin cans and
rubbish gaining the shelter of the
scrub where he bent a course parallel
with the street

  he was stiff and sore from his
cramped position in the sled and his
foot pained sharply his progressi
was slow and he paused to rest on
the edge of a small clearing in the
center of which well back from the
highway stood a tiny cabin

  in the doorway an old man with a
short cutty - pipe between his lips

leaned upon a crutch and surveyed the
sky with weatherwise eyes

  bill instantly recognized him as the
old man with the twisted leg who ten-
dered the well-meant advice upon the
night of his first arrival in the little
town and his face reddened as he re-
membered the supercilious disregard
with which he had received it

  for a moment he hesitated then ad-
vanced toward the door the old man
removed his cutty-pipe and regarded
him curiously

  good morning called bill with
just a shade of embarrassment

  good marnin yersilf grinned
the other a twinkle in his little eyes

   may i ask where i will find a man
called daddy dunnigan

   in about foive minutes yell foind
um atein breakfust wid a shtrappin
young hearty wid a sore fut come
an in oim me own housekaper
cook an bottle-washer but av oi do
say ut mesilf oive seen wor-rse 
so you are daddy dunnigan
asked bill as he gazed hungrily upon
the steaming saucers of oatmeal the
sizzling ham and the yellow globes of
fresh eggs fried  sunny side up

   yell take a wee nip befoor ye
eat asked his host reaching to the
chimney-shelf for a squat black bottle

   no thanks smiled bill  i dont
use it

   me nayther replied the other
with a chuckle  oi misuse ut and
pouring himself a good half tin cup-
ful swallowed it neat at a gulp

  the meal over the men lighted their
pipes and bill broached the object of
his visit the old man listened and
when bill finished spat reflectively
into the wood-box

   so buck moncrossen sint ye afther
me did he 

   yes he said you were a good
cook and i can certainly bear him out
in that but he said that you would
only work if you damn good and felt
like it and if you didnt you wouldnt
the old man grinned

   hes roight agin an oiil be tell-
the promise



in ye now oi damn good an dont
feel loike wor-rkin fr moncrossen
th dirthy pirate takin a mans pay
wid wan hand an shtealin his timber

av his own mither fr th price av

   an did he sind ye down afoot an
expict me to shtroll back wi ye th
both av us on crutches  

   no i have a team here laughed
bill  they are in creeds stable

  creeds the old man glanced
at him sharply   phwat ar-re they
doin at creeds 

  well that is a long story but it
sums up about like this i see you
know moncrossen - so do i and
moncrossen is afraid i will crab his
birds-eye game-and i will too when
the proper time comes

   but he saw a chance to get rid of
me so he sent me after you probably
knowing that you would not come
but it offered an excuse to get me
where he wanted me then he framed
it up with creed to steal the team in
the night while i was camped at mel-
tons no  and leave me to die
bushed

   i built a fire in the shack ate my
supper rigged up a dummy near the
fire and then went out to the sled and
crawled under the tarp after making
sure that i was asleep creed stole the
team as per schedule but he did not
stop at that he decided to make
sure of me so he locked the door on
the outside and fired the shack

   i remained under the tarp and as
creed was going my way i let him do
the driving while he put up the team
i slipped out the back way and here
i am

   th dirthy murdherin hound
exclaimed the old man chuckling and
weaving his body from side to side in
evident enjoyment of the tale

   an phwatll ye do wid um now
yere here the old man sat erect
and stared into the face of his guest
whose eyes had narrowed and whose
lips had curved into an icy smile

   first ill give him the damnedest
licking with my two fists that he ever
got in his life then ill turn him over
to the authorities

  jdaddy dunnigan leaned forward
and laying a gnarled hand upon his
shoulder shook him roughly in his
excitement

   yer nameb by phwat is yer
name his voice quavered and the
little eyes glittered between the red-
rimmed lids bright as an eagles the
younger man was astonished at his
excitement

    why bill he replied

   bill or moike or pat - wurrah

  the old man paused and filled his
pipe muttering and chuckling to him-
self bill grasped his hand wringing
it in a mighty grip

   you have guessed it he said
huskily  my name does not matter
i am a mckim she was my mother

nodded and daddv dunnigan drew
a coarse sleeve across his eyes and
puffed hard at his short pipe

   and will you go back with me

  the old man remained so long that
bill thought he had not heard he
was about to repeat the question when

chapter xxii

creed sees a ghost

when bill awoke yellow lamp-
light flooded the room and
daddy dunnigan was busy
about the stove from the direction of

which came a cheerful sizzling and the
appetizing odor of frying meat and
strong coffee

  for several minutes he lav in a de-
licious drowse idly watching the old
man as he hobbled deftly from stove
to cupboard and from cupboard to
table

  so this was the man he mused of
whom his mother had so often spoken
when as a little boy he had listened
with bated breath to her tales of the
fighting mckims

  he remembered how her soft eyes
would glow and her lips curve with
pride as she recounted the deeds of
her warrior kin

  but most of all she loved to tell of
captain fronte the big fighting
devil-may-care brother who was her
childish idol and of one james dun-
nigan the corporal who had followed
captain fronte through all the wars
and to v hose coolness and courage her
soldier brother owed his life on more
than one occasion and whose devotion
and loyalty to the name of mckim was
a byword throughout the regiment
and in kerry

  and now thought bill that i have
the promise



found him i will never lose sight of
him he needs some one to look after
him in his old age

  over the little flat-topped stove the
leathern old world-rover muttered and
chuckled to himself as he prodded a
fork into the browning pork-chops
shooting now and then an affectionate
glance toward the bunk

   saints be praised  he muttered
 oid av knowd um in hiven or hell
or hong-kong captain frontes own
silf he is as loike as two peas an
the age av captain fronte befure he
was kilt phwin he was th besht offi-
cer in all th british ar-rmy-or an-ny

   an lord be praised hes a
foightin man - but a mckim that
dont dhrink wurrah maybe he
wasnt failin roight or th liquor
didnt look good enough fer um oill
thry um agin

  bill threw off the blankets and sat
upon the edge of the bunk

   that grub smells good daddy
he sniffed	

   aye an twill tashte good too av
ye fly at ut befure ut gits cold yeve
had shleep enough fer two min-cap-
tain fronted git along fer wakes at a
toime on foorty winks in th saddle
 i am afraid i will have a hard time
living up to captain frontes stand-
ard laughed bill as he adjusted his
bandages

    well thin oill tell yez th fir-rst
thing captain fronted done phwin
his two feet hit th flure hed roar fer
a dhrink av good liquor

   an thin hed ate a dozen or two
av thim pork-chops an wash em
down wid a gallon av black coffee-
an hed be roight fer an-nything from
a carouse wid th brown dancin

nautch gir-rls to a brush in th hills
wid their fightin brown brothers

   th liquors waitin-ut moightnt
be as good as yere used but oive
seen captain fronte himself shmack
his lips over worse an as fer th tin
cup-hed dhrink from a batthered to-
maty can or a ladys shlipper an rasp
th dhregs from his troat wid a cur-rse
or a song as besht fitted th toime or
th place he was in

  the old man began to pour out the
liquor say phwin he cried an
oive yit to see th mckim twud
hurry th wor-rd

  bill crossed to the old man who
propped against the table watched the
contents of the bottle gurgle and splash
into the huge tin cup and laid a hand
upon his arm

   that will do daddy he said
the man ceased to pour and peered
inquisitively into the cup  taint
half full yit  he protested passing it
to bill who set it before him upon the
table where the rich fumes reached his
nostrils as he spoke

   this whisky he began  smells
good-plenty good enough for any
man but you dont seem to under-
stand i dont drink whisky - good
whisky or bad whisky or old whisky
or new wrhisky or red white and blue
whisky-or any other kind of booze

    have drunk it - bottles of it -
kegs of it-barrels of it i suppose for
i played the game from harlem to the
battery and then i quit

   ye aint tellin me yere timper-
ence the old man inquired with
concern as he would have inquired
after an ailment

   no that is if you mean am i one
of those who would vote the world so-
ber by prohibiting the sale of liquor
it is a personal question which every
man must meet squarely-for himself
-not for his neighbor

   i am not afraid of whisky i am
not opposed to it as an issue in fact
i respect it for personally it has given
me one peach of a scrap-and we are

  bill regarded the old man sharply
but in his bearing was no hint of jest-
ing nor raillery and the little eyes
were serious

   yes there was a girl said bill
slowly  but she-she does not know

   so yeve had a scrap wid her too

  and so a half-hour later bill car-
mody for the second time pushed open
hod burrages door and made his way
to the stove

  the scene in no wise differed from
the time of his previous visit slabs
of bacon still hung from the roof logs
beside the row of tin coffee-pots the
sawdust-filled box was still the object
of intermittent bombardment by the
tobacco-chewers the uncertainty of
whose aim was mutely attested by the
generous circumference of brown-
stained floor of which the box was the
center

  grouped about the stove upon coun-
ter barrel-head and up-ended goods
box were the same decaying remnants
of the moldering towns vanishing
population

  the thick cloudy glass with its
sticky edges still circulated for the
common good and above the heads of
the unkempt men the air reeked gray
with the fumes of rank tobacco

  only the man who entered had
changed in his bearing was no hint
of superiority nor intolerance he ad-
the promise



vanced heartily hailing these men as
equals and friends near the stove he
halted leaning upon his crutch and
swept the group with a glance

  good evening do any one of
you men happen to be named dunni-
gan  

  from the moment the tap of bills
crutch sounded upon the wooden floor
creed who had paused in the middle
of a sentence of his highly colored
narrative stared at the newcomer as
one would ordinarily stare when a per-
son known to be dead casually steps
up and bids one good evening

  his mouth did not open his lower
jaw merely sagged away from his
face exposing his tongue lying thick
and flabby upon yellow teeth his
out-bulging eyes fixed the features of
the man before him with a glassy un-
winking stare like the stare of a fish

  into his brain at first came no
thought at all merely a dumb sense
of unreasoning terror under which his
muscles went flaccid and out of con-
trol so that his body shrank limp and
heavy against its backing of bolt-
goods

  then suddenly a rush of thoughts
crowded his brain tangled thoughts
and weird-of deep significance but
without sequence nor reason

  what had they told of this man in
the woods how he had battled hand
to claw with the werwolf and re-
ceived no hurt how he had cowed
the boss with a look and laid the
mighty stromberg cold in the batting
of an eye

  he himself had but twenty hours
since seen this man lying helpless upon
the floor of a locked shack ringed
round with roaring flames bejond any
human possibility of escape

  and here he stood crippled beyond
peradventure of trail-travel yet fresh
and unfatigued forty miles from the
scene of his burning a thin trickle
of ice crept downward along his spine
and overmastering all other emotions
came the desire to be elsewhere

  he slid from the counter and as his

feet touched the floor his knees crum-
pled and he sprawled his length almost
at the feet of the man who could not
die

  as a matter of fact creed aged ma-
terially during his journey to the door
but to the onlookers his exit seemed a
miracle of frantic haste as he clawed
and scrambled the length of the room
on hands and knees in a maudlin panic
of terror

  and out into the night as he ran in
the first direction he faced the upper-
most thought in his mind was a blind
rage against moncrossen

  the boss himself was afraid of this
man yet he had sent him creed to
make away with him-alone-in the
night the quavering breath left his
throat in long moans as he ran on and
on and on

  your friend seems to have been
in something of a hurry ventured
bill as burrage gave a final twist to
the old newspaper in which he was
wrapping fallons jug

  the storekeeper regarded his cus-
tomer quizzically and spat with sur-
prising accuracy into the box

   yes he replied dryly  creed
hes mostly in a hurry when thevs
strangers about but to-night he
seemed right down anxious thataway

chapter xxiii
head-lines

the brute in moncrossen held sub-
servient the more human emo-
tions else he must surely have
betrayed his surprise when twelve
hours ahead of schedule the greener
swung the long-geared tote-team to a
stand in front of the office door

  not only had he made the trip with-
out mishap but accomplished the seem-
ingly impossible in persuading daddy
dunnigan to cook for a log camp
when in all reason the old man should
have scorned the proposition in a tor-
rent of irish profanity

  moncrossen dealt only in facts


all-story weekly

speculation as to cause and effect
found no place in his mental economy
his plan had miscarried for that
creed must answer later the fact
that concerned him now was that the
greener continued to be a menace to his
scheme

  had creed in some manner bungled
the job or had he passed it up he
must find out how much the greener
knew the boss guessed that if the
other had unearthed the plot he would
force an immediate crisis

  and so he watched narrowly but
with apparent unconcern while bill
climbed from the sled followed by
daddy dunnigan in the hard-packed
snowof the clearing the two big men
faced each other and the expression of
each was a perfect mask to his true
emotions

  but the greener knew that the boss
was masking while moncrossen ac-
cepted the others guileless expression
at its face value and his pendulous lips
widened into a grin of genuine relief
as he greeted the arrivals

  hullo you back areadv hullo
dunnigan im sure glad you come
well have some real grub fer a change

  hey lafranz he called to the
passing frenchman  put up this
team an pack the gear to the bunk-
house

  as the man drove away in the direc-
tion of the stable moncrossen regard-
ed the others largely

   come on in an have a drink
hoys he invited throwing wide the
door hows the foot

    better replied bill  it will be
as good as ever in a week

    im glad of that cause i sure am
cramped fer hands ill let fallon
break you into sawiiv an put strom-
berg to teamin hes too pot-gutted fer
a sawyer

  moncrossen produced a bottle as the
others seated themselves

  what-dont drink he ex-
claimed as bill passed the bottle to
dunnigan thats so blieve i did
hear some one say you didnt use no

booze -well every man to his own
likin me-about three good stiff
jolts a day an a big drunk in the
spring an fall is about my gait have
u seegar bill accepted the proffered
weed and bit off the end

  how he said with a short
sweep of the arm then scratching a
match on the rung of his chair lighted
the unsavory stogie

  thus each man took measure of the
other and daddy dunnigan tilted the
bottle and drank deep the while he
took shrewd measure of both

   it was in the early afternoon of the
following day that bill carmody
tossed aside his magazine and yawned
drowsily alone in the bunk-house
his glance roved idly over the room
with its tiers of empty bunks and racks
of drying garments

  it rested for a moment upon his
bandaged foot propped comfortably
upon fallons bunk directly beneath
his own and strayed to the floor where
just under its edge still wrapped in the
soiled newspaper sat the gallon jug
that fallon suggested in case the
greener saw fit to heed his warning

   bill smiled dreamily lmconscious-
lv his lips spelled out the words of a
liead-lines that stared at him from the
rounded surface of the jug

popular members of new yorks
four hundred to wed

  wonder who thought bill
reaching for his crutch he slipped the
end through the handle of the jug and
drew it toward him he raised it to
his lap and the words of the succeeding
line struck upon his brain like an elec-
tric shock

   engagement of miss ethel manton and

   gregory st ledger soon to be announced

   feverishly his eyes devoured the fol-
lowing lines of the extended heading

time of wedding not set will not take place

    immediately tis said prospective bridegroom

    to sail for europe in spring
the promise



  and then the two lines of the story
that appeared at the very bottom
where the paper folded under the edge
of the jug

  new york february i special to
tribune-as a distinct surprise in elite
circles will come the announcement of the
engage

  he tilted the jug in frenzied eager-
ness to absorb every detail of the bitter
news and was confronted by the
rough stone bottom which had worn
through the covering leaving mangled
shreds of paper whose rolled and
mutilated edges were undecipherable

  vainly he tried to restore the tat-
tered remnants but soon abandoned
the hopeless task and sat staring at the
head-lines

  over and over again he read them
as if to grasp their significance and
then with a full realization of their
import he closed his eyes and sat long
amid the crumbled ruin of his hopes

  for he had hoped in spite of the
scorn in her voice as she dismissed
him and the bitter resentment of his
own parting words he loved her and
upon the foundation of this love he had
builded the hope of its fulfilment

  a hope that one day he would return
to her clean and strong in the strength
of achievement and that his great pas-
sion would beat down the barrier and
he would claim her as of right

  suddenly he realized that as much
as upon the solid foundation of his
own great love the hope depended up-
on the false substructure of her love
for him

  and the false substructure had
crumbled at the test she loved an-
other  had suddenly become as unat-
tainable as the stars-and was lost to
him forever

  the discovery brought no poignant
pain no stabbing agony of a fresh
heart-wound but worse-the dull
deep soul-hurt of annihilation the
hurt that damns mens lives

  he smiled with bitter cynicism as
his thoughts dwelt upon the little love

  of women the shifting love that rests
but lightly on the heart to change with
the changing moon and upon the
constancy of such love he had dared to
build his future

   fool  he cried and laughed
aloud a short hard laugh-the laugh
that makes god frown from the
water-pail at his side he drew the
long-handled dipper and removed the
cork from the jug and tilted the jug
and watched the red liquor splash
noisily from its wide mouth

  from that moment he would play a
mans game would smash moncrossen
and his birds-eye men would learn
logs and run camps and among the big
men of the rough places would win to
the fore by the very force and abandon
of him

  pie had beaten the whisky game
had demonstrated his ability to best
john barleycorn on his own terms and
in his own fastnesses

  and now he would drink whisky-
much whisky or little whisky as he
saw fit for there was none to gainsay
him-and in his life henceforth no
woman could cause him pain

  he raised the dipper to his lips and
the next instant it rang upon the floor
and over the whole front of him
splashed the raw liquor and in his
nostrils was the fume and reek of it

  unmindful of his injury he leaped
to his feet and turned to face daddy
dunnigan who was returning his
crutch to his armpit

   toimes oive yanked captain

old man was saying and the red-
rimmed rheumy eyes shone bright

	all-story weekly

   no mckim iver yit raised th
white flag an none iver died wid his
back to th front set ye down lad
an think it over

  he finished speaking and hobbled
toward the door and passing out
closed the door behind him alone in
the bunk-house bill carmody turned
again ro the jug and fitted the cork to
its mouth and with his crutch pushed
it under the edge of fallons bunk

  hours later when the men stamped
in noisily to the wash-bench he was
sitting there in the dark-thinking

  the results of daddy dunnigans
cooking were soon evident in the
blood river camp men no longer
returned to the bunk-house growling
and cursing the grub and moncrossen
noted with satisfaction that the daily
cut was steadily climbing toward the
eighty-thousand mark

the boss added a substantial bonus
for each days  top cut and in the
lengthening days an intense rivalry
sprang up between the sawyers not
infrequently bill and fallon were  in
on the money

  it was nearly two weeks after the
incident that creed came to mon-
crossen with his own story of what
happened that night at meltons no
s and the boss knew that he lied

  as they talkedin the little office the
greener accompanied by fallon
passed close to the window

  at the sight of the man the spot-
ters face became pasty and he shrank
trembling and wide-eyed as from the
sight of a ghost and moncrossen
knew that his abject terror was not
engendered by physical fear

  he flew into a rage cursing and
bullying the craven but failed utterly
to dispel the unwholesome fear or to
shake the others repeated statement
that at a few minues past ten oclock
that night he had seen the greener
lying hopelessly drunk upon the floor
of the shack with the flames roaring
about him and at six clock the next
evening had seen him hobble into bur-

  rages store forty miles to the south-
ward fresh and apparently unharmed

save for his injured foot

  moncrossens hatred of the greener
rested primarily upon the fear that
one day he would expose him to
appleton added to this was a mighty
jealousy of his rapid rise to proficiency
and the rankling memory of the scene
of their first meeting in the grub shack

  but his fear of him was a physical
fear-a fear born of the certain knowl-
edge that measured by his own stand-
ards the greener was the better man

  and now came the perplexing ques-
tion as to how the man had reached
hilarity when creed was known to
have arrived there with the team eight
hours after the burning of the shack

  the boss had carefully verified so
much of creeds story by a guarded
pumping- of dunnigan and the crafty
old irishman took keen delight in so
wording his answers and interspersing
them with knowing winks and quirks
of the head as to add nothing to the
bosss peace of mind

  while not sharing creeds belief in
the greeners possession of uncanny
powers nevertheless he knew that
whatever happened that night the
greener knew more than he chose to
tell and as his apprehension deepened
his rage increased

  hate smoldered in the swinish eyes
as in the seclusion of the office he
glowered and planned and rumbled his
throaty threats

   the drive he muttered  my
bucko bill youre right now picked
for the drive an ill see to it myself
that you git yourn in the river

chapter xxiv
the log jam

the feel of spring filled the air
the sun swung higher and higher 
and the snow turned dark and
lay soggy with water with the in-
creasing warmth of the longer days
mens thoughts turned to the drive
tpie promise



  they talked of water-front streets
with their calk-riddled plank sidewalks
and low-fronted bars of squalid back
wine-rooms where for a week they
would be allowed to bask sodden in
the smiles of the painted women-
then drugged beaten and robbed
would wake up in a filthy alley and
hunt up a job in the mills

  it was all in a lifetime this annual
spring debauch the men accepted it
as part of the ordered routine of their
lives accepted it without shame or
regret boasting and laughing unblush-
ingly over past episodes - facing the
future gladly and without disgust

   you mind jake sontos place
where big myrtle hangs out they
frisked joe manning fer sixty bucks
last year i seen em do it what
me i was too sleepy to give a cuss-
they got mine too

  and so the talk drifted among them
revolting details of abysmal man-fail-
ings brutal reminiscences of knock-out
drops robbery and even murder fur-
nished the themes for jest and gibe
which drew forth roars of laughter

  and none sought to avoid the inevi-
table rather they looked forward to it
in brutish anticipation accepting it as
a matter of course

  for so had lumber-jacks been
drugged beaten and robbed since the
first pine fell-and so will they con-
tinue to be drugged beaten and robbed
until the last log is jerked dripping
from the river and the last white board
is sawed

  on the night of the th of april
the cut was complete and on the morn-
ing of the th ten million feet of logs
towered on the rolhvays along the
river ready for the breaking up of the
ice

  stromberg had banked the birds-
eye to his own satisfaction and mon-
crossen selected his crew for the
drive-white-water men whose boast
it was that they never had walked a
foot from the timber to the mills
bateau men who laughed in the face
of death as they swarmed over a jam

key-log men who scorned dynamite
bend watchers whose duty it is to
stay awake through the long warm
days and prevent the formation of
jams as the drive shoots by-each se-
lected with an eye to previous expe-
rience and physical fitness

  for among all occupations of men
log driving stands unique for its hard-
ships of peril discomfort and bone-
racking toil

  from the breaking out of the roll-
ways until the last log slips smoothly
into its place in the boom-raft no
mans life is safe

  yet men fight for a place on the
drive-for the privilege of being
soaked to the bone for days at a time
in ice-cold water of being crushed to
a pulp between grinding logs of being
drowned in white-water rapids where
a man must stand his log moving at
the speed of an express train time
and again shooting half out of water
to meet the spray of the next rock-
tossed wave of making hair-trigger
decisions when an instants hesitation
means death as his log rushes under
the low-hanging branches of a
 sweeper

  for pure love of adventure they
fight-and that a few more dollars
may find their way into the tills of
the jake sontos of the water-front
dives for among these men the bait-
ing of death is the excitement of life
and their pleasures are the savage
pleasures of firstlings

  those who were not of the drive
were handed their vouchers and
hauled to hilarity while those who re-
mained busied themselves in the pack-
ing and storing of gear for in the
fall the crew would return to renew
the attack on the timber

  followed then days of waiting

  the two bateaus-the cooks bateau
with its camp stove and store of sup-
plies and the big bateau with its
thousand feet of inch and a half
manila line coiled for instant use
whose thick flaring sides and floor of
selected timber were built to over-

ride the shock and battering of a thou-
sand pitching logs-were carried to
the bank ready for launching

  the sodden snow settled heavily

and around the base of stumps and
tle trunks of standing trees appeared
rings of bare ground while the course
of the skidwavs and cross-hauls stood
out sharp and black like great veins
in the clearing

  each sag and depression became a
pond and countless rills and rivulets
gurgled riverward bank full with
sparkling snow-water

  over the frozen surface of the river
it flowed and wore at the shore-bound
ice-floor and then one night the ice
went out

  titanically it went and noisily with
the crash and grind of broken cakes
and in the morning the river rushed
black and deep and swollen its
roiled waters tearing sullenly at crum-
bling banks while upon its muddy
surface heaved belated ice-cakes and
uprooted trees

  at daylight men crowded the bank
the bend watchers strung out and
took up their positions and white
water men stood by with sharp axes
to break out the roll ways

  the first roll way broke badly

  a thick-butted log slanted and met
the others head-on as they thundered
down the bank tossing them high in
the air whence they fell splashing into
the river or crashed backward
among the tumbling logs upending
and hurling them about like jack-
straws

  the air was filled with the heavy
rumble of rolling logs as other roll-
way s tore loose at the swift blows of
the axes where at the crack of tog-
gle-pins men leaped from in front of
the rolling crushing death and the
surface of the river became black with
bucking pitching logs which shot to
the opposite bank

  coincident with the snapping of the
first toggle-pin the branches of a
gigantic storm-blasted pine whose
earth-laded butt dragged heavily along

the bottom of the river became firmly
entangled in the low-hanging limbs

of a sweeper and swung sluggishly
across the current

   against this obstruction crashed the
leaping upending logs of the wrecked
rollway other logs swept in and
wedged forcing the heavy butt and
the riven trunk of the huge tree firmly
against the rocks at the head of the
rapid

  roll way after roll way tore loose
and the released logs swept down-
ward by the resistless push of the cur-
rent climbed one upon another and
lodged higher and higher the jam
towered the interlocking logs piling
in hopeless tangle

  moncrossen was beside himself
up and down the bank he rushed bel-
lowing orders and hurling curses at
the men who gripping their peaveys
swarmed over the heaving jam like
flies

  the bateau men forty of them
lifted the heavy boat bodily and
working it out to the very forefront
of the jam lowered it into the water
while other men made the heavy cable
fast to the trunk of a tree close
under the towering pile the bateau
was snubbed with a short light line
and the men clambered shoreward
leaving only moncrossen stromberg
fallon and one other to search for the
key-log

  it was a comparatively simple jam
the key to which was instantly ap-
parent to the experienced rivermen
in two large logs wedged in the form
of an inverted v the quick twist
of a peavey inserted at the vertex of
the angle and the drive should move

  fallon and stromberg past masters
both of the drive made ready while
the other stood by to cast off the light
line and allow the bateau to swing free
on the main cable

  moncrossen clambered to the top to
shout warning to those who swarmed
over the body of the jam and along
the edges of the river

  at ihe first bellowed orders of the
the promise



boss bill carmody had leaped onto
the heaving jam and following in the
wake of others began picking his way
to the opposite shore

  new to the game he had no definite
idea of what was expected of him
so with an eye upon those nearest
him he determined to follow their
example

  to watch from the bank and see
men whose boast it is that they  cd
ride a bubble if their calks wouldnt
prick it leap lightly from log to roll-
ing log hesitate run its length and
leap to another as it sinks under them
nothing looks simpler

  but the greener who confidently
tries it for the first time instantly
finds himself in a position uncomfort-
ably precarious if not actually dan-
gerous

  bill found to his disgust that the
others had gained the opposite bank
before he had reached the middle
where he paused balancing uncer-
tainly and hesitating whether to go
ahead or return

  the log upon which he stood oscil-
lated dizzily and as he sprang for an-
other his foot slipped and he fell
heavily his peavey clattering down-
ward among the promiscuously tangled
logs to come to rest some six
feet beneath him where the white
water curled foaming among the logs
of the lower tier

  bill glanced hastily about him ex-
pecting the shouts of laughter and
good-natured chaffing which is the in-
evitable aftermath of the clumsy mis-
adventure of a rivernian the bateau
men were just gaining the shore and
the attention of the others was en-
gaged elsewhere so that none noticed
the accident and with a grin of re-
lief bill clambered down to recover
his peavey

  and moncrossen peering over the
top of the jam took in the situation
at a glance-the river apparently clear
of men and the greener invisible to
those on shore crawling about among
the logs in the center of the pile

  it was the moment for which he
had waited even the most careful
planning could not have created a
situation more to his liking at last
the greener was  his

  there she goes he roared and
turning slid hastily from the top and
leaped into the waiting bateau

   let er go  he shouted

  fallon and stromberg leaped for-
ward and simultaneously their peaveys
bit into the smaller of the two key-
logs

  both big men heaved and strained
once twice thrice and the log turned
slowly allowing the end of the other
to pass

  the logs trembled for an instant
then forced by the enormous weight
behind them shot sidewise crossed
each other and pressed the tree-trunk
deep under the boiling water

  a mighty quiver ran through the
whole mass of the jam it balanced
for a shuddering instant then with a
mighty rush let go

  over the side of the bateau tumbled
fallon and stromberg sprawling on
the bottom at the feet of the boss
while the man in the bow cast off
the light line

  the next instant the heavy boat
leaped clear of the water overriding
climbing to the very summit of the
pounding plunging logs which threat-
ened each moment to crush and batter
through her sides and bottom

  the strong new line was singing
taut to the pull of the heavy bateau
which was being gradually crowded
shoreward by the sweep of the down-
rushing logs

  suddenly a mighty shout went up
from those on the bank the men in
the bateau looked and there almost
in the middle of the stream was the
greener leaping from log to log of the
wildly pitching jam

  they stared horror-stricken with
tense blanched faces each instant
seemed as if it must be his last for
they knew that no man alive could
hope to keep his feet in the mad rush

and sweep of the tumbling tossing
drive

  yet the greener was keeping his
feet time and again he recovered
his balance when death seemed immi-
nent and amid wild shouts and yells
of encouragement climbing leaping
running stumbling he worked his
way shoreward

  he was almost opposite the bateau
now and stromberg hastily coiling
the light line leaped into the bow
then just when it seemed possible

that the greener might make it a huge
log shot upward from the depths and
fell with a crash squarely across the

log upon which he was riding

  a cry of horror went up from half
a hundred throats as the man was
thrown high into the air and fell back
into the foaming white water that
showed here and there through the
thinning tangle of logs

  the next instant a hundred logs
passed over the spot drawn down by
the suck of the rapid

ihe monday morning horde
of women milled and vol-
leyed around the bargain
square in the sub-basement
of the peoples emporium

  above the eager heads
and flopping hats of those
nearest the firing line signs lured and
beckoned those back in the ruck of the
bargain-hunting army

   was c-now c

   worth -choice c

  true half the shoppers in the rear
guard did not know what it was all
about but clearly it was worth risking
an eye an ear or a switch to learn

  probably shirt-waist transparencies
were on display it might be new-fan-
gled mouse-traps or bed dresser or

corset-covers but the printed coun-
ter-tags called and urged as would an
enemy s battle-flags and the assault
flowed was repulsed ebbed and flowed

again

  in the trenches within the square
flushed and perspiring girls poised
their pencils like bayonets valiantly
withstanding each attack

 some went down crushed and
breathless before carefully planned
sorties only to spring back to the fray
with challenging shrieks of- two
for you lady   cash or charge 
and  bought by self

  one militant eagle goaded by hope-
less desperation pummeled an ob-
structing wren who blocked the path
to victory
the moll buzzer



  the eagle struck with heavy shop-
ping-bag but the wren retaliated with
an elbow thrust straight at the eagles
jugular

  the eyes of another quick-saler sud-
denly flamed with battles lurid light
with a screaming babe held high
above her head as though she were
about to hurl a deadly hand-grenade
she executed a brilliant forward pass
crying

  take your kid annie i want
some myself and empty handed
surged into the midst of the awful riot

  floor-walkers skirted the crowd
harrying and jeering the buyers on to
fresh atrocities against the weary
trench-holders cash-girls hair fly-
ing eyes staring weaved and threaded
and catapulted like powder monkeys
saucing here scratching there and bit-
ing yonder

  finally when a grim-visaged pa-
triot seized a garment and waved it
aloft as a banner of defiance only to
see a sleeve torn from it by one of the
defied a floor-walker remarked to a
companion in crime

   its a great day for the empori-
um   and it was

  also a great day for moll hencher

  moll fluttered and pecked through
the crowd like a small and scrawny
mother hen much to the sniffing and
sometimes more vociferous and ribald
disgust of the women for moll was
a man - a short squat oily sallow-
faced derby-hatted and coat-buttoned
individual but a man nevertheless

  and pray what was a man - and
especially one with a dinky market-
basket on his arm-doing in a place
where chemises hosiery garters or
other unmentionables and unnoticea-
bles might be on exhibition and sale

  but moll assailed with the fiercest
advanced with the bravest crawled
and squirmed forward with the
sneakiest

  it was too much the women al-
most gave up browbreating the sales-
ladies to tongue-lash his cringing male
anatomy

      a-s

   my pocketbook its gone you
-you wretch-youve got it 

  the cry of a female in distress
echoed through emporium aisles a
gaunt arm flipped above the heads and
an open shopping bag hairpins pow-
der rag and handkerchief flying
plopped down on the molls derby
denting and crushing it until his ears
stood at right-angles with his skull

   my pocketbook give it up thief
i felt him jerk my bag take that-
and that police dont let him get
away 

  the words and blows engulfed hen-
cher as a verb-avalanche and fist-
tornado combined

  he expostulated fumed and denied
while he struggled in the grip of bony
but strong fingers he looked fur-
tively around for a chance of flight as
other women snatching anxiously at
their own belongings drew back in
dismay

  floor walkers cash girls and the
more intrepid of the passers through
other aisles closed in the looted lady
again blew up with a loud report

   he has my purse - the skinny
wretch  red outside black inside -
she was telling of her pocketbook not
the moll although the description
would have fitted either- and it had
five dollars and eighty cents 

  are you sure of your man
madam

  the voice was impressive and the
question came in solemn and judicial
manner from a tall sleek flashily at-
tired man who had been halted on his
walk through an adjacent aisle by the
first cry

  he had pushed through and taken a
place at the right of hencher - be-
tween that gentleman and the bargain
shambles as he put his query he
twisted a heavy watch chain with one
hand and oratorically waved another
on which a great diamond sparkled
imposingly

   yes are you quite certain  peev-
ishly asked a floor walker showing in
his tone that he was not vastly in love


all-story weekly

with this diversion in emporium fes-
tivities

  sure of course i am splut-
tered the exasperated lady  fools
dont i know when my pocketbooks
gone i felt his skinny hand hes
got it search him-go through the
beast 

   but he looks like a nice home-
body insisted the prosperous stran-
ger his black mustache raising and
parting in a placating smile  a reg-
ular mr gentleman flat-dweller out
shopping for the good wife

   all bosh that silly basket-more
bosh whats a man doing here any-
way she eyed the molls defender
belligerently  search him 

  hencher gulped and wheezed as if
about to enter a few remarks in his
own behalf when the stranger still
sitting in judgment interrupted

   well madam if youre so sure of
your ground will you please pass upon
the ownership of that red purse-on
the counter there-among those-er
-those goods 

   mine  exclaimed the shopper
grabbing the article from where it was
partially hidden and quickly assuring
herself that the five dollars and eighty
cents was undiminished  but i felt
that fellow crowd me he tugged at
my bag too whats a man doing here
i d like to know serves him right
skinny men pooh  

  the maddened bargain - hunters
closed in the floor walkers were
hustled away the bayonet wielders
again on the defensive parried and
thrust and stabbed and moll hencher
basket on arm and crestfallen derby
on ears ambled miserably down an
aisle with the elegant stranger as pilot
and preacher

   you dave hencher still a moll-
buzzer i see 

   well platt whats a gink to do
you gotta get along whined the
moll hands deep in pockets and basket
trailing like some new style of wicker-
bustle  i gotta live aint i

    thats obvious sneered his critic

 but this time you came close to living
off the state for a while however i
see you recognized me

   reconize you id reconize you
in-well in hotter places than a moll-
rush to a bargain-counter mowd y
turn the trick platt i thought i was
gone up th river-me again fer stir 
 i just fell back on the old stuff
explained platt smiling over his own
accomplishment and the unspoken
praise in the molls words  i hap-
pened to be in the store on business
with one of the department heads t
heard the baying of the hounds and
recognized you as the one up the tree

   i took the leather-you still call
them leathers dont you-from your
coat-pocket and slipped it onto the
counter just like that but you-still
a moll-buzzer after fifteen years still
preying on women the lowest of
thieves why dont you try second-
story work stealing door-mats - or
something dignified  

  yes still a moll-buzzer blurted
hencher  tell me what else i cd
do will you aint the bulls all hep
t me aint it  move on  all th time
get away fom here an hot-foot fom
there aint it once a dip alius a dip
with th bulls an aint a moll-buzzer
just cause he frisks womens hand-
bags an pockets trun out by th crooks
an yeggs who tink theyre a bit
higher 

   oh i knew the gang wouldnt
have much use for one of your kind
assured platt  but i didnt know the
police were barking so close to your
heels have you done your time

   barkin is good but bitin would
be better wrailed the moll bringing
lip on a corner when it seemed that his
benefactor had gone about as far as he
cared to with one so notorious  meb-
be not in this town tlv bulls aint so
keen on me but in other places-gee
an certain ive done my bit twro
years-five years

  then as if comparisons might help
his w eak case  but youve done a
stint r two yerself
the moll buzzer



   only one dave let me correct
you protested platt grinning in an
indulgent and superior way and sizing
up henchers shabby and shiny suit
which did not bear close inspection al-
though at a distance he might have
passed for the loving husband and
father out to pick up a weeks bargains
in groceries

   that was the only time dave-
the one you helped me out of he con-
tinued  and it was because of your
aid on that occasion that i took a
chance and helped you this morning
but i must be moving dave due at
the office you know

  wait a minute platt-just a min-
ute pleaded the moll practically un-
screwing the derby in his efforts to get
it off and fashion it into a less maudlin
shape  gimme a tip old scout
whats yer lay now y look some
genteel fer fair iron lid tin shirt
biled vest spitty-spats an shiner
shoes my-o platt wise me up

   it isnt a line dave answered
platt pausing and turning back  at
least no line that you would know any-
thing about i simply branched off the
old road for fifteen years ive been
decent and honest dealing with decent
and honest folk it was a new and
thick leaf i turned over id advise
you to do the same a home and wife
and children on one side dave on
the other - well theres stir and the
long time think it over

   huh a swell chance id have
platt with th bulls gorin me on one
side an th gang harpoonin me on
tother no use 

  nevertheless hencher gazed en-
viously at the silk hat perfectly
groomed figure white vest gray spats
and patent-leather shoes as he added

   itd be a fine hick of a boob whod
give me a show now wouldnt it
me-pickin womens pockets an doin
penance up river fer fifteen years-
me 

    might be the boob declared the
other  and-i believe i will-for the
sake of that - well because i dont

think you got started right any man
can make good if hell work but it
isnt platt any more dave its per-
rin-robert j perrin instead heres
my card if youll come to my office
in say an hour-better not come in
with me-well talk it over in the
mean time ditch the basket and cut the
moll-buzzing

  a convenient alley received into its
flinty bosom the undesirable wicker-
work and hencher took a few turns
around the neighborhood thinking
over his own career and what he had
come to as he compared it with the
sunnier happier paths of the one who
had been bob platt

  pie had come upon plait in an up-
state workhouse where they were
both doing their six months bit as
vagrants

  really they were not vags but
vagrancy covers a multitude of sins-
and sinners

  a robbery had been committed the
police dragnet had been thrown out
and both hencher and platt had been
hauled in with the greater and lesser
fishes

  neither was guilty and both had
money in their pockets yet for being
birds of passage-without nest or visi-
ble means of support-they had as-
sisted the county in its road-building
efforts by making little rocks out of
big ones

  but only for three months then
hencher had proposed to platt his
rock-pile buddy because he was the
human anchor at the other end of his
leg-chain that they escape through the
simple expedient of crawling into a
thicket while a somnolent guard was
taking his afternoon siesta knocking
off the rusted and ill-fitting shackles
with a rock-hammer and walking
away

  their scheme had miscarried only
when platt in nervous haste wounded
his ankle more than the iron bracelet

  i-iencher already released had re-
fused to desert his injured comrade
had supported and half carried him for


all-story weekly

miles to a safe retreat in the under-
brush of a ravine had foraged pro-
visions over the countryside for three
days until platt was in condition to go
his way

  there had been  pursuit-the of-
ficials evidently figuring it a good rid-
dance and the pair had separated
journeying in almost opposite direc-
tions

  that was fifteen years ago since
then hencher had done his seven years
in two instalments

  with women always as his victims
he had come to be known as moll hen-
cher his picture adorned several
rogues galleries and on this morning
after the long struggle he could only
boast of the clothes on his back-
worth in the aggregate about twelve
dollars the few coins in his pockets
a poor room in the lower town and a
reputation which would get him ten
years if he ever showed his nose to a
criminal judge again

  a scant fortune of which he did not
boast-the entire fruits of criminality
and petty dipping - was embraced
within the narrow limits of an account
in a side-street savings bank this
bank-book having across its face a
carefully chosen alias and holding in
its folds a credit for three hundred and
twenty - five dollars was concealed
under a corner of the carpet in his
room

  with the crooks usual caution
dave had managed to provide a fee
for a mouthpiece or attorney against
a day when he might be compelled in
spite of his wriggling jostling ways
to face that criminal judge

  his pursuits took him to store-sales
matinees concerts into the crowded
streets to busy corners on street-cars
-to all places where women might
congregate

  he seldom buzzed a male women
were safer more easily outrun-took
jostling more amiably than did men

  the game could hardly be called
profitable but the wolves at his door
apparently drove away the dogs of the

law for he had not seen the inside of
a jail in eighteen months-nor the in-
side of a first-class restaurant either

  it would never do and the moll
knew it to eat into that nest-egg for
the mouthpiece whose spieling might
be needed any day

  with the bob platt of other years
things must be quite different

  the department store episode had
brought him out of the past he was
clad in much purple and fine linen

  the  iron hat  which had aroused
the molls jealousy while it might con-
stitute an unpardonable offense in a
pickpockets eyes nevertheless bespoke
a considerable plutocracy the per-
fect fitting and tight-buttoned coat
hinted at an august and capable check-
book beneath-a book that would pass
much more readily than the puny thing
in the inner lining of daves blowzy
coat

  and the diamonds on the hands and
in the necktie-

   why th guy sports more ice thn
a rink soliloquized the moll  he
sparks like a arc lamp 

  platt-or perrin-must be doing
pretty well honest ways paid if you
had the wit to get by and the brain to
put it over

  and yet platt had been a crook him-
self or at least hencher thought so
pie had never been quite sure until the
bargain-counter scene

  the dexterity with which his old
prison mate had extracted the leather
from his kick and concealed it among
the flubdub on the counter was con-
vincing it was a cinch platt had
certainly been a dip in the old days-
or he never could have pulled such a
flooey

  and now look at him why the
old josser probably lolled in his own
gas-bucker and bullied a shover and
he could go around to the bull-pen and
hoot at the cops

  no fanning of him by cheap peelers
and town constables it all came from
the honest lay-from the respectable
road
the moll buzzer



  well maybe for the sake of the old
days that back-door foraging and self-
denial platt would wise him to how
the road was traveled

  he would go through with the thing
anyway if he could do no better he
might con platt into kicking in with a
few iron men for his general mainte-
nance or he might pipe the line-up
around the offices with an eye to a little
transom work and desk jimmying

  but the mere thought of such des-
perate criminality made the rabbit-
hearted moll sicken with terror

  hencher slunk past the uniformed
attendant at the door of the office
building and tried to efface himself in
a far corner of the elevator on his ride
to the twelfth floor indicated on the
perrin business card

  he had a deep-rooted aversion to
uniforms even on elevator pilots
blue or gray with braid and brass-
buttons always seemed tuned to the
jingling of keys and clanging of locks

  besides the elevator door had a way
of snapping like a greedy steel jaw-
the jaw of stir for instance

  a fewr beads of sweat stood out on
henchers mere sample of a forehead
and he jammed the low-crowned derby
still further over his eyes he was far
from happy as he sidled and edged
along the corridor and eased through
a door on which was printed in letters
of impressive size

robert j perrin  co

investments

   ah right on time mr henshaw
i see smiled perrin or platt speak-
ing over the head of a stenographer at
whose side he had been standing when
the moll came in blinking at the opu-
lent array of counters cages desks
filing cabinets clerks and office boys

  perrin put a significant emphasis on
the  henshaw implying that the
moll-rose by another name would be
much sweeter

   glad to see you henshaw henry
show the gentleman into my private
office ill be with you in a moment

mr itenshaw

  inside and alone hencher gaped
at his surroundings

  the easy chairs the directors table
the desk as big as a concert piano the
rugs hat - racks - everything modem
and expensive got under his tough
hide what a vast difference there wras
in all this from the meager pilfering
of housemaids and jostling of women
already burdened with bundles and
babies

  a settlement worker had once ear-
nestly endeavored to chisel into the
molls flinty head the admonition that
 honesty is the best policy

  he had insisted in his dull defense
that if men were only honest because
it was the best policy they were not
necessarily honest at heart it seemed
to him that merely being upright
through fear of the law or public cen-
sure did not constitute genuine recti-
tude

  had lie been writing that phrase he
would have put it  honesty is the
right policy

  but now he was convinced that
probity integrity and fairness paid
dividends there were financial and
moral gains not to be overlooked
chicanery deception theft and fraud
were the handmaidens of poverty and
misery

  why the whole thing was exempli-
fied in the personalities of dave hen-
cher thief and robert j perrin
broker they had started over dif-
ferent paths from the same chain-
gang-

  both wrere thirty-eight years old
and-now look at them

  hencher was hard-pressed to dis-
pose of his derby it did not loom as
a suitable decoration on the office rug
nor on a near-by chair and he would
not have crossed that room to one of
the hat-racks - no not for a molls
hand-bag full of greens

  so he laid the greasy head-gear on


all-story weekly

the open desk and in doing so his eyes
bugged out at sight of a thin stack of
hilts beneath a round glass paper-
weight

  a plant framin fer me eh
he sneered as he noted another door
evidently leading out into the corridor
 thinks ill fall fer th small bunch o
lettuce nix on that gee if th cribs
worth anyting itll do better thn
that 

  for five minutes plenty of time to
make a getaway he sat eying the
money and tilting in his chair then
perrin came in breezily nonchalantly
tucked the bait in a vest-pocket hand-
ed over a fat cigar which looked to
have cost about as much as the buzzers
shoes lit one himself and began

   now well not be disturbed dave
so listen me out please you dont
appear overfed overdressed or over-
prosperous evidently you havent
clone well thats the fault of your
system it doesnt pay

   so it dont platt-mr perrin
the moll looked around apprehen-
sively as if large ears might have heard
his break  i got two years wunst fer
friskin ninety cents fom th pocket of
a dame that looked like shed be good
fer ninety thousand

   thats my point continued per-
rin grandly flicking the ash from his
cigar with a be jeweled finger and
daintily lifting a lint speck from his
lapel  i never exactly tried it mere-
ly fell in with a crooked lot for a time
-and you helped me out

   now i might contend that this
mornings stunt squared matters hut
really i ran no risk no one would
have suspected robert j perrin even
without the pocketbook trick why
 number among my clients at least
two dozen women heads of depart-
ments in that store

   now ive decided if youre will-
ing of course to give you a chance at
the straight road-the one  have trav-
eled it may be just a whim but its
going through the thing pays in dig-
nity respectability-and funds when

you arrive you are looked up to and
esteemed your name becomes a great

asset

   however -as an afterthought-
 speaking of names i think the hen-
shaw of the outer office will be better
than the hencher of the past

   anytingll be better thn th rnoll-
buzzer gulped hencher  its a
snide monniker mr p-perrin but
how dye know i wont snitch on you
fer that past yer speakin of

   oh i hadnt given it a thought
but no one would believe you dave
vou could blat it from the battery to
the bronx and you couldnt get one
rise a day although you might get a
fall-back for blackmail

   however im expecting you to be
grateful thankful youll be a sort of
helper around the office-whatever
you can do at the start your pay will
be ample sufficient youll get a de-
cent room and decent clothes

   i could do the story-book act and
hand you over the money -tapping
the vest-pocket loftily- but i prefer
to see you earn it sometimes i may
give you little confidential jobs but 
-shaking an admonitory finger- no
moll-buzzing we have a dozen or so
girl employees and hundreds of callers
-mostly women-every day

   dont let the hand-bags or other
articles of virtu get you down keep
straight follow me do as i have done
and some day david henshaw may be
quite as prosperous and well-to-do as
one dave hencher was notorious and
neer-do-well

  perrins delicately manicured finger
pushed a button and something in a
uniform bounced through the door
hencher gurgling his surprise started
to his feet but slumped back into his
chair when he perceived it was only
an office boy

  henry explained perrin this
is mr david henshaw who will take
charge of the lctter-press and the cir-
cular and pamphlet room you will
show him what there is to be done

  as the moll gathered his soiled
the moll buzzer



chapeau under his arm and departed
from the philanthropic perrins pres-
ence he leaned over and whispered

   gee platt-i cant get hep t these
uniforms i tought youd called th
harness bulls

  for ten days the moll in his incom-
petent haphazard and low-browed
way puttered around the offices of
robert j perrin investment broker
but what he lacked in efficiency he
made up in zeal

  each morning he was waiting in the
corridor when the door was opened
at night he almost had to be evicted
by the janitor

  either his soul was in his efforts or
he hoped to find himself at some time
the sole occupant of the rooms with
principal eye to the cashiers cage and
vault

  the latter seemed to occupy most of
his thoughts he gazed rapidly at the
important looking books and the more
satisfactory heaps of currency which
disappeared into it of evenings and re-
appeared next morning the books to
be scattered over desks while the cash
was arranged in imposing stacks on
the glass counter of the cage

  once the cashier remonstrated with
him

   your place is in the mailing room
henshaw there is nothing around
the vault that could possibly interest
you except the combination - and
thats only known to mr perrin and
myself

   i wasnt pipin th crib grumbled
hencher falling back  his old
jargon

  then as the cashier moved away
with a smirk at his own low wit

   th old josser poof fer him-
he wears cuffs 

  after the first week the moll blos-
somed forth in cheap but gaudy im-
provements

  with perrin as a model he went in
for a tin-shirt he installed a white
piping in the collar of his vest a pair
of gray spats concealed much of his
decrepit shoes his suit was pressed

and he affected an article which looked
more like a hat than the sad-eyed derby
which he consigned to a trash-can

  he had the fringe of mousy hair
harvested from around his ears and
three shaves grew where one had
sufficed before

  really the moll at small outlay was
arriving with a bound and perrin
rather grandiloquently though com-
plimented him on his neater appear-
ance

  one afternoon while observing the
results of his work at a letter-press he
spelled his way through several sen-
tences of an outgoing communication

  the molls early education had been
somewhat neglected-his father hov-
ering too close to a corner saloon
while his mother in her turn had
hovered too close to an eternally active
washtub this had not made for class-
pins but dave after a fashion could
bludgeon and blast his way through
plain typewritten english

  and so he read 

dkar madam 

  we note what you say about the invest-
ment of two thousand dollars made two
years ago with your statement that it has
brought no dividends as yet in reply we
wish to assure you that extensive develop-
ment work on the properties in question
has cut down the net profits far beyond a
dividend paying point

  however such improvements have
been economically and ably installed and
are real and permanent assets to the stock-
holders

  while the stock has depreciated great-
ly since you invested-and will hardly pay
dividends within the next few years-we
can say speaking for the directors and not
on our own responsibility of course
that-

  hencher walked over to a stenog-
rapher who seemed the most amiable
of the office force because she had
nodded pleasantly each morning and
asked

   what is this ting anyway miss

  oh the letter holding out her
hand for it  you are to make two
copies henshaw


all-story weekly

   yeh t know about th letter miss

t mean this ting  he waved his hand
to include the perrin quarters tile
room vault and private offices  you
know-this dump

   why an investment office hen-
shaw the lady smiled indulgently
wondering where perrin had found
what appeared to be only a simple un-
sophisticated worker

 who invests miss henshaw
leaned two yellow fists on the dek and
peered at her from a pair of dark eyes
sunk in sallow cheeks

   anybody with money i suppose
then returning to her work  why
dont you ask mr perrin or maybe
youd better not i dont think hed
like your cross-examination

  at another time he read almost
through a sheet which ran

madam 

  we have learned from the big brother
insurance company that you will receive
within the next few days five thousand dol-
lars as insurance following the sad death
of your husband we knew him in life
and are certain that were he here to-day
we need only refer to him concerning our
business standing and resources

  realizing that you will be looking for
permanent and profitable investment we
solicit your consideration of-

  there followed a glowing eulogy of
the very business properties against
which the former investors com-
plaints had been aimed

  even the dwarfed intellect of the
moll could embrace the fact that while
one woman had lamented a paucity of
returns from her money the perrin
agency was still actively engaged in
crowding the same stock onto others
at a fancy figure insisting that it
would pay amazingly

  thereupon the moll became even
more inquisitive certainly more inter-
ested in the money which fell into the
vault in currency flakes and was carted
to the bank in currency drifts

  me opened letters as he had once
opened hand-bags and pried into their
contents quite as eagerly as if they
were leathers which he was examining

in the privacy of a convenient alley
and for one of such shallow brain-
pan lie learned much even while he
kept away from the traps of small
financial bait which perrin and the
cashier who evidently acted on in-
structions frequently set for him

  he was not to be tempted by petty
cheese he knew they were trying
him and he also knew that if he de-
cided to grab it would be at dollars
instead of pennies

  the two facts that soaked in deep-
est were that few men came to the
cashiers window and few letters went
forth to men unless it might have been
to attorneys who had protested in
behalf of clients

  generally-almost always-the vis-
itors were women-women of a cer-
tain shabby and somber black with
careworn sorrowful faces and eyes
that looked out as through a constant
tearful mist

  also the printed circulars in the
mailing room sent pleas to investing
women rather than to men telling of
wise ways in which to invest insurance
moneys inheritances the savings from
salaries earned in stores offices work-
shops and even kitchens the address-
ing machine at which the moll labored
much of the time contained the title
of miss or mrs a dozen times where
it held a mr once

  at intervals too the moll had heard
words other than friendly at the cash-
iers window and on several occasions
from perrins inner office had leaked
damp sounds as of tears and sobby
protestations but the others of the
force seemed to have no ears so the
moll did not worry his head greatly
although he did shake it often enough
and vigorously

  on the afternoon of his tenth day
hencher was busy sealing and stamp-
ing some of perrins private mail the
work was being done under the watch-
ful eye of the boss who had taken a
keen and very secret interest in the
preparation of the letters and in the
list of people to whom they were to go
the moll buzzer



   this is a private drag dave
perrin explained  i dont want the
 company  to know of it

  hencher had never seen the  com-
pany  alluded to on the door plate
although he had understood the word
to apply to a wealthy citizen who came
rarely to the office and was interested
in other concerns of similar nature

   pm putting it through myself as a
side-line ran on perrin  i expect
you to keep quiet i cant always trust
the stenographers and the others to do
that some way i fancy theyd bite
me if i ever permitted them to grow
sharp teeth

   aw im no snitch mumbled the
moll from over a stamp-glued tongue
 either way it aint no time off my
term

  the door opened with a pop and a
woman came hurriedly into the inner
office her face was flushed as from
the excitement of some daring deed
a black veil was pushed back over the
brim of a black hat a shiny dress
inexpensive and in a past style cov-
ered her scant figure

  black gloves and shoes made her a
veritable woman in black except for
the color of her cheeks and the gray
flash from her eyes

  perrin half leaped from his chair
his face red as the carnation he per-
sistently sported in his lapel con-
trolling the mingled anger and flustra-
tion which showed in his eyes he
greeted her affably enough

   why mrs erhardt good after-
noon  did the boy show you in  
the last with just a taint of rebuke

   he did not mr robert j perrin
 co  snapped the visitor going at
once into battle  i walked in with-
out any boy ive cooled my heels out-
side with a grinning boy staring at me
the last time i intend to

  very well mrs erhardt we
neednt get excited calmed the suave
perrin  i didnt know you had been
refused admission i can assure you
henshaw you may leave the letters
for a while

   let the man stay ordered the
truculent mrs erhardt  he looks
honest enough it will do me good to
see one honest male around

   this will never do smiled the
broker nervously motioning dave
back to his task  now what is the
trouble my dear mrs erhardt

   just this mr perrin-and dont
 dear  me ive been here four times
-yes half a dozen-to find out why
i never have received any returns
from that precious stock you coaxed
and cajoled me into buying and not
once have i been allowed in this office
until i opened that gate pushed the
boy aside and came in

   now i want to know and im
going to wait for the information you
and your fine-worded letters id be
willing to guess that man over there-
the fellow with the honest face - is
mailing some of them out right now
henchers cheeks took on a faint
salmon color blushing was not his
strongest point but he knew the wom-
an had spoken the truth the letters
were being sent to the nearest female
relatives of a score of men who had
been killed in a building collapse and
on whose claims the contracting firm
had decided to settle

   you know very well the visitor
pursued  that your letters promised
me big dividends and you know it
was the only money i had to support
my childen you said you knew my
husband and wanted to help me you
have been a tremendous help i must
say two and a half years and i
havent seen a cent i cant live and
my little ones cant be sent to school
on promises

   i dont believe my husband ever
knew you id hate to think that of
him anyway now i either want
satisfaction or ill see a lawyer

   my dear mrs erhardt perrin
placated speciously applying the term
in spite of the womans angry gesture

 so far as employing an attorney is
concerned let me assure you it will
only be an added expense i havent


all-story weekly

your money it went for the stock
which you purchased in a perfectly
legitimate way and with eyes wide
open you received the certificates
and receipted for them your threats
do not frighten i may as well tell
you 

    want that money-my last three
hundred dollars-you have it in a
voice which was rapidly breaking and
mixing with tears  its here some
place-in these fine jimcracks wav-
ing one of her poorly gloved hands at
the costly furniture   want it ill
see a lawyer-or maybe youd prefer
the police

  at the last word the scarlet tinge in
perrins cheeks met up half-way with
a pallid fear turning his face to a sick-
ly purple splotched with yellow but
he proceeded with his explanations
while his white hand fell as softly on
the jackets worn sleeve as if he had
been smoothing the feathers of an
angry hen

   now dont talk about unpleasant
things - lawyers and - police and
you dont want your money either
mrs erhardt - not the principal at
least lets say you want your divi-
dends isnt that it of course it is
i have it from the directors of crested
butte consolidated - not on my own
say-so mark you but on theirs-
that in six months the company will be
in such shape that youll be sorry you
ever doubted the stock

   oh is that a promise mr per-
rin cried the woman finally burst-
ing into the tears which had been but
a word or two away during the whole
conversation if it is-i dont mind
the-the hard work im doing to keep
the ch-children fed and clothed and in
school but i c-cant stand the grind
another day unless i know-know its
coming right in the end

   not a promise reneged perrin
hastily who seemed unable to part
with real money but my best judg-
ment

  a hand reached over his shoulder
picked up a pen and dipped it into a

cut-glass inkwell probably as expen-
sive as anything in the erhardt home

  the moll explained as he walked
back to the table  one o these letters
aint right ill fix it

  then he scratched away for a few
seconds while the visitor still sobbing
gave evidence of returning to her first
advantage

   well ihat isnt satisfactory mr
perrin it was your judgment that
got me in and oh for gods sake-
for the sake of my babies-please get
me out you have that money its
here some place i want it

   are y sure o yer man madam 
the words were spoken as the moll
buzzer came for the second time from
the temporary mailing table perrin
paused in the middle of a calming
reply started in surprise and made as
if to motion the intruder back

  the woman answered

  wtiat of course im sure
didnt i hand it to this man perrin
myself didnt i see him take it
 i asked lady answered the moll
as if repeating something he had mem-
orized because if youre so sure o
yer ground what have yt say t this
check for three hundred dollars-your
money perrin aint got it im th
one im one o them directors hes
talkin about

   heres yer check maam go cash
it - right away - fer them there
babies 

  the woman seized the slip eagerly
assured herself that it set forth the
things described and cried

   thank god for an honest man
i knew it 

  the door opened and closed with a
slam mrs erhardt was gone but
perrin the purple departed and the
red again in his angry face turned on
the moll

   now what do you think thats
the way i give up money what do
you mean  

  i mean just this screeched the
moll back at his place and his fist
coming down on the sealed and
the moll buzzer



stamped envelopes with a thump
which made perrin halt hop out of his
chair  i mean that you-you-can
go clean immaclately cnsecitively
an evry other way plumb t hell
heres where i quit this dump 

  the words came almost as loud as
the table blow

  the stubble at the back of henchers
head where the hair was cropped close
and shaved round seemed to stand out
like hackles cheeks that had long
since lost the art of flushing turned
drab as old ashes drops of sweat
stood out on the bulges below the dark
eyes as if the man were in actual physi-
cal pain again he whacked the top
of the polished table

   right heres where i blow the
joint see

  you quit-you-you quit me
scoffed perrin coming the other half
out of his seat he started with a
sneer but ended with scorn as he saw
that the moll must mean what he was
saying

  thats it came the reply  you
did me a good turn wunst an ive
done you one just now that was a
narrow squeak-shed a had th bulls
down on yuh sides she ought t had
th money you an mere square-an
pm through through an busted
too but im satisfied

  whats the idea hencher
growled perrin in a milder tone as
something in the nature of a great light
seemed to break over him  ill ad-
mit that maybe it was the right thing
to do but for me to have given her
the money would have been an admis-
sion of guilt dont you see im
obliged to you now calm down

   dont be obliged t me fer any-
thing bristled hencher  i want t

synopsis of preceding chapters

ixa darling wife of colonel darling an english officer in the indian service
enters into a violent flirtation with gerald andrews of the civil service but
when at a dance at the viceregal lodge in simla he pleads with her to  bolt with
him she laughs at him and tells him coldly that she always tires of men when they
begin to get serious she also coolly confesses that the only man she really loves is
not her husband but a man whom every one has for years thought to be dead later
andrews identifies this man as ninas cousin and at the time of his disappearance
her fiancee lord harry kneedrock who was reported killed at spion kop in the boer
w ar his body being identified by colonel darling himself

   kneedrock turns up unexpectedly and nina meets him at the bungalow of an
american friend a mrs sibylla ramsay she begs him to take her away but having
discovered her affair with andrews he contemptuously refuses that night while in
his gun-room darling is shot dead the official verdict is  death by accident but
popular gossip is divided between the theories of suicide and murder by either nina
or kneedrock nina returns to england where after a number of more or less seri-
ous flirtations all ending disastrously for the men she starts a still more furious one
with sir caryll carleigh whose engagement to an american girl miss rosamond
yevnol has recently been broken the country-house where nina kneedrock and
carleigh are visiting is burned to the ground and nina is terribly injured if she
recovers at all it is said she will be horribly disfigured the guests all seek refuge at
a near-by estate there carleigh is sitting at the breakfast table when the door opens
and rosamond veynol enters

fates fearful ingenuity

osamond veynoi

stopped short just inside
the door and every vestige
of color left her face

everybody rememlered
then and everybody was
scared it was a tryingly
dramatic moment

carleigh astounded and greatly con-
tused half rose in his place and bowed
slightly and awkwardly miss veynol
bent her head without looking at him
the countess of cross saddle pre-
tended to know or notice nothing

one man whistled under stress of

the moment and then turned deeply
crimson the butler who knew de-
tails of which all his superiors were
naturally ignorant-he being a regu-
lar reader of british society-let fall
a muffin cover

  and then suddenly everybody per-
ceived that the only space left vacant
at tablewas the space next to carleigh
and saw with horror that one of the
men who knew nothing had pushed a
chair in there for the newcomer

  miss veynol looked waveringly
about the countess choked

  of course you two are old
friends- she began

  and then her tongue cleaving to
the roof of her mouth she rose

thfia atory began in the all-story weekly for may 


the man-eater



hastily stammered something quite
unintelligible about the injured woman
upstairs and precipitately fled

   i had better go too carleigh
murmured starting to rise  i-
i-  he would have sold his soul
to be able to say  am betrothed to
mrs darling but he wasnt sure
she was going to die and so he didnt
dare

  nevill dalgries who had the place
on the other side of him and being a
good friend was awfully sorry put
out a strong hand and pulled him back
into his seat again

   you cant do anything old man
he said with a roughness that was
kindness  finish your tea

  and at that instant rosamond sank
into the proffered seat beside him so
there they sat side by side those two
one blazing red one deathly white
silent and constrained

  and all the rest at the breakfast-
table talked feverishly and painfully
with a haste and loudness that ap-
peared to them obligatory

  those who watched say that sir
caryll drank his tea and ate two slices
of buttered toast and that miss vey-
nol spooned an egg without upsetting
the cup which may be perfectly true
though neither he nor she was aware
of doing any such thing

  what they did they did subcon-
sciously their conscious minds being
very much otherwise engaged one
thing is certain however and that is
that neither of them spoke until hap-
pening to look up carleigh saw that
everybody else had got up and got out
and left them quite alone

  he felt then that he simply had to
say something and so he said as so
often happens the one thing that he
shouldnt have said he asked   is
your mother here

  miss veynol looked down shivered
slightly rose and moved over to a
window carleigh rose too and fol-
lowed her

   mama is in ireland she an-
swered at length in a low sweet voice

 she told me before she went-
she-  then she stopped

  he threw his gaze over her from
head to feet he felt bitter and
scornful and yet the memories
crowded fast after all she was very
lovely and-odd how he had seen her
face early this very morning when for
all he knew he was dropping to his
death

   what do you think of me any-
way  he asked at length  w hat is
your final opinion of us all three

  she looked up at him all her shy-
ness seemed suddenly gone her eyes
met his fearlessly yet her voice was
very low as she said  i think that
you love mama

  of course she would think that if
she had ever doubted it his question
uttered a minute ago on their re-
meeting must have convinced her

  he took a backward step and drew
in his breath up-stairs nina was dy-
ing perhaps on every hand fortune
seemed bent on breaking with him
he was lashed stung crumpled he
looked at her and truth cowered
naked

   not at all he said with biting
emphasis  perhaps people talk that
and you believe it but ive never
thought of such a thing i have of-
fered myself to mrs darling and
ive given her your ring

  he paused expectant but rosa-
mond just stared at him

  then he walked out of the room
hurt and-rather frightened

  it had been one of those fearfully
ingenious tricks of fate which she
deals out in such a starthngly unex-
pected manner-this meeting with his
whilom fiancee

  chasing the woman who had the
power to make him forget only to be
abruptly thrust in the very midst of
it under the same roof with her he
was striving never to remember was
malevolent cruelty and it was very
awful

  yes it would have been much bet-
ter had he slept five minutes longer

then there would have been no es-
cape and his troubles would have been

over

chapter xx

fires of one kind and another

it was a very miserable morning for
carleigh it was pretty miserable
for every one seeing that things
were all at sixes and sevens owing to
the enforced mingling of two house
parties but the young baronet with
counter emotions tearing things apart
deep down in the soul of him found
it especially so

  out-of-doors was quite impossible
the heavy clouds were unloading their
burden in a drenching downpour
some brave one proposed a tramp to
car fen and a search of the cooling
ruins but found so few volunteers
that the project was given over

  bridge games were started in both
the red and yellow drawing-rooms
blissmore the novelist had induced
nevill dalgries to oppose him at chess
and the pair sat in silent concentration
over board and men in the library

  for a long while sir cary  hung
about the hall in expectation of a word
with dr dodson on his morning
visit only to learn after something
like two hours of waiting that the
medical man had come and gone dur-
ing that period of agony in the break-
fast-room

  nevertheless there was some mea-
sure of relief for him in the tidings
that dodson had pronounced his
patient improving steadily

  julian archdeacon had told him
this having had it direct from cecile
 he doesnt say that ninas out of
danger but he does say that with a
continued nbsence of fresh symptoms
she very soon will be

  carleigh sighed and a faint color
tinged his wan pallor he had been
pallid as a ghost ever since he told
miss veynol about the ring if i
could only see her he muttered

  but julian thought that quite im-
possible

   its mostly shock dont you
know he said  and everything de-
pends on keeping her quiet

  the relief small as it was was not
lasting when he had flung that final
ill-considered speech at rosamond he
had really believed ninas case hope-
less

  if she got well rosamond would
be sure to learn that what he said
wasnt true and she would probably
hate him all the more for it there-
fore it was actually imperative that he
have a word with mrs darling at the
very earliest opportunity

   i mean to ask dr dodson at all
events he said  when will he be
here again 

  the honorable julian didnt know
he might be over in the afternoon
and then just as likely he might not
be over until evening

   waldron is burned worse than
was thought he added  he never
gave a sign and yet he must have
been suffering torments his self-
command was nothing short of spar-
tan

  but at this carleigh frowned

   we have thought best to wire for
his wife archdeacon added

  his wife exclaimed carvll

   yes good little woman does
a lot of slum work in london and all
that sort of thing you know time
was too much taken up to come down
with him

  so here was a measure of relief
from another quarter

   did you wire for any of mrs
darlings people

   no she didnt want any one
wc suggested sending for the duke
and duchess but the idea only ex-
cited her then we thought of
kneedrock hes a cousin you know
and a sort of next-of-kin protector
and adviser but she wouldnt have
him at any price gritty little wom-
an nina

  dr dodson came between tea and
the man-eater



dinner and it was more through good
luck than good management that car-
leigh saw him

  he had gone to his nursery bed-
chamber where he had been looking
over the evening things laid out for
him only to discover that the pumps
provided were fully two sizes too
large

  twice he had rung for valet or foot-
man without response-his own man
had been shipped up to town that
morning-and was on his way to
nevill dalgriess quarters when he en-
countered an elderly gentleman-
bearded carrying a small profes-
sional-looking hand-bag and stepping
with professional briskness-turning
into the corridor from an intersecting
passage

  he stopped him without the least
hesitation  t fancy you are dr dod-
son   he said

  the physician signified assent and
carleigh introduced himself

   i do so want to learn of poor mrs
darling he went on  i am very
anxious

   mrs darling dodson replied
 is doing capitally i have every rea-
son to believe that she will make an
amazingly quick recovery sir caryll

   that is good news indeed car-
leigh rejoined  and now there is a
favor i have to ask i really think
that i should be allowed to see her

  the doctor pursed his lips and his
eyes shot a question through his
glasses

   i am deeply interested in her the
young man went on  and i helieve
she would wish it if you let her
know

  his effort was to speak in exactly
the right tone all things considered
vet he was wofully uncertain as to
just what were the things he had to
consider

   t will ask her of course re-
turned dodson rut t must warn
you in advance sir caryll that mrs
darling does not care to see any one
aside from the severe shock she is at

present you know so very badly dis-
figured

  caryll experienced a deathlike sink-
ing at his heart until this minute he
had barely considered this matter of
disfigurement he just couldnt be-
lieve it-couldnt realize it as a pos-
sibility

   how-  he began and stopped
short

   one side of her face is very badly
burned said the doctor

  a man doesnt like to hear such
things about a woman for whom he
has just confessed an attachment it
took a brief moment for carleigh to
collect himself then beg her to
see me please he asked a little
stiffly

  he saw the physician go but he had
very little hope it was hardly pos-
sible that she would accede to his plea

  she didnt want  doodv  and
 pucketts she didnt want even
 nibbetts who it was clear to him
was usually her help in time of trouble
what chance then was there that she
would see him

  but to his surprise and that of the
doctor as well she did

  her maid came back with dodson
and took him to the room and there
in the half dark made by the drawn
window-curtains he saw her lying in
the wide white bed her beauty hid-
den-or was it her hideousness-by
swathing white cloths

  she looked curiously eastern and
uncanny and his thoughts crowded
and he was dumb

  but she held out her right hand to
him and said so nice to see you
but-what is this i hear they are tell-
ing about us such astounding
tales

  then he knew that rosamond had
made no secret of his daring speech
and that the doors and windows of
gossip were all set open afresh

  he sat down in a chair close by her
side and took the hand she offered and
held it close to his own

   i have been telling the truth he


all-story weekly

said with that cool odd courage

which leaps like a well-trained ser-
vant to do the bidding of some men
 it is only a few days as time is
counted but clocks should be our
slaves instead of our masters to
me it seems an eternity since you so
gave me back to myself that i -lie
faltered ever so slightly- could love
-yes really and truly-love again
and i do oh nina i do just
you-only you

  then all at once he remembered
and looked sharply about the room
he had forgotten the maid he had
not thought of cecile archdeacon
they might be there somewhere cur-
tained by the gloom

   dont be alarmed nina said
amused  there is no one but i to
hear your confession cecile with-
drew discreetly before you came and
my maid parted from you on the other
side of the door

   i love you he repeated reas-
sured

  but you have said openly here in
this house that we are engaged-that
i had your ring

  for a breath he hesitated then
 let it stand he pleaded and bent
toward her  you are like me you
are sick of it all the world has
bruised us both-has tried to make
outcasts of us both-has blackened us
falsely

   let us go away together-to
v ukon to ceylon to where you will
let us build for ourselves a free life
-a new clean life out in those free
new clean surroundings

  he was actually surprised at his
own eloquence and at how in earnest
he felt and how chivalrous but he
was still more surprised at how keen
he was to prove to rosamond that he
had spoken truthfully

   but im disfigured said nina be-
hind her white windings  horridly
disfigured

   it will not matter he declared

   and i am old i count for ten
years beyond you

   that is our own affair-our very
own affair he feit the hand within

his quiver lightly and hope rose i
really am very fond of you she whis-
pered

   believe me it is love he whis-
pered in return  see how it snatched
us both in the same instant

  her fingers nestled sweetly in
among his own

   did kneedrock tell you more than
you told me   she asked

   yes he answered frankly
 but it made no difference i dont
care what people say about you

   but i have played with fire so
often-once too often she added
with a laugh  fire came near end-
ing me at last

abruptly his curiosity roused
 they say you were safely down
stairs and that then you turned and
went back why did you go back  
 i wanted something

   what  what was worth the
risk

  for just a little she did not answer
then slowly she reached out her
other hand-her left hand  for
this she said

  he looked and fancied he must be
dreaming for lo there on her engage-
ment finger sparkled a ring-his ring
the ring that he believed lost the ring
that he believed no woman would ever
wear again

  for a full minute he was too
amazed too stunned to speak

   you-you found it  he stam-
mered at last

   i never threw it away at all she
confessed  i only made the mo-
tion why should i throw away a
perfectly good pearl and diamond
ring when the mere motion of throw-
ing answered every purpose 

   every purpose what purpose 
   my purpose and she smiled

   but i-i dont understand what
could have been your object

   ill tell you she replied he
could see her eyes quite clearly now
his own had grown accustomed to the
the man-eater



gloom he could see them so clearly
as to read mischief in them he won-
dered whether it was possible that she
was suffering the least bit

   i just wondered what you would
say and do i knew of no better way
to test a mans whole character than
by pretending to toss away as worth-
less something that he highly values
 my whole character he echoed
 did you have to test it 

   i didnt have to i wished to
one learns of the real man then and
i am so interested in real men

  the thing rather hurt him but he
said  i suppose you were satisfied
 my interest was she answered
and he was clever enough to note the
distinction she effected by the word
and the emphasis

   im glad if it amused you he
said not at all pleased  are you
going to tell me what you learned  
 im going to let you draw your
own conclusions she answered  i
told a man once in india that there
was a cobra in the corner of the room
in which we were sitting just to see
what he would say

   what did he say 

  he didnt say anything he
acted

   was there a cobra there 

   of course we could both see
it

   you were telling the truth then 
   after my fashion yes

   and what did he do 

   he shot

   and- 

   the bullet knocked the cobra over
it was bronze

  then for the first time since he en-
tered the room he let go her hand
 and that satisfied your interest 

   that satisfied me she said and
he would have sworn she slightly em-
phasized the pronoun

   there must have been a lot of
shooting out there in india he said
significantly somehow he felt ter-
ribly vexed

  no he didnt want to go into any

      a-s

wilds with this woman he recalled
that reincarnated tigress idea of knee-
drocks no yukon or ceylon no
surely not

  she seemed to read his thought
she drew back her right hand which
he had dropped so coolly and turning
a little on her side she reached out her
left	-

   there take off the ring and give
it to miss yeynol she said cheer-
fully  i really cant marry you in-
deed i cant dont pass me dont
even press my hand its absolutely
no use go on now and leave me to
sleep

  it was carylfs mood of the moment
to feel relieved he took the ring
from her finger thrust it into his
waistcoat pocket and rose then he
bowed a little stiffly after which he
left her to sleep

an end to the gossip

all masculine and human as he
was sir caryll carleigh
emerged from that darkened
room with a vivid vision still remain-
ing of the white bandaged face and
a keen awareness of the engagement
ring once more in his possession enor-
mously eased

  if there was a sense of somewhat
summary dismissal to annoy it was
more than offset by the knowledge
that he was absolutely free yes free
even of the chain made by his own
impulsive speech

  a thoroughly foolish man embar-
rassed by the product of his various
and gregarious emotions may still
have sense enough left to experience
relief at being afforded a fresh chance

  life in spots was very trying to
the young baronet but still it might
have been far worse

  one may not enjoy being buffeted
about by a woman one is almost sure
one loves still its a poor ball that
isnt conscious of a thrill as it rises

in the air of limitless freedom after
a hard kick

  so carleigh went lightly along the
corridor and turned lightly at the
angle and as he turned he came face
to face with rosamond yeynol and
rosamond it so chanced was looking
beautiful as she had never looked
beautiful before

  he stopped abruptly and so did she
he gasped and she likewise gasped
but somehow it was far less awful
than before because here there was

	one present to witness their be-
havior

  he put out his hand and she put
hers in it before she thought it came
to him just then suddenly that he
had told her he had offered himself to
mrs darling and given her the ring
and now he had that very ring in his
waistcoat pocket

  his breath came fast-so fast that
ir almost choked him

   rosamond   he stammered
 oh rosamond  

  she was dressed for traveling and
was evidently just on her way down
in point of fact she was about quit-
ting the house to have herself further
embarrassment

  she wasnt expecting to meet car-
leigh on that side of the house and
the encounter had startled her as it
did him more than slightly

  she stood actually panting she
strove to look at him and failed ut-
terly then she tried to free her hand
land failed in that too

  had the place been less public he
would surely have taken her in his
arms but dinner was barely an hour
off and guests were likely to le pass-
ing at any minute

  moreover being at the angle of the
corridor they were likely to come
upon them without any warning what-
ever just as they had come upon one
another

   rosie he said without the
slightest premeditation or considera-
tion  ive been very unhappy and
very foolish and mrs darling has

brought me to my senses she doesnt
want me and she doesnt want the
ring will you take it back will
you take me back she says that you
are the one i love and  think she
knows

  all this at headlong speed spoken
as fast as he could form and utter the
word as he ended he opened the
hand that had been fumbling at a
pocket and showed her the ring-her
engagement ring-lying in his palm

  she seemed to stumble and fall side-
ways against the wall and his arm
went out to steady her

   oh   she gasped  and ma-
ma what of mama

   well run away and get married
his words were as wild as her own
 well tell no one well fly and
afterward-afterward- but there
he stuck

   and mama   she said again
 and mama  

  he was sure now that for him she
was the only woman in the world
 we will live abroad he said
heartily  ceylon yukon or some
place -his imagination surely had
limitations this evening-and we will
never come back

  rosamond at length achieved con-
trol

   mama will never leave us in
peace she declared  mama will
find us wrherever we go believe me
mama is quite set against the mar-
riage she will not have it and she
says if it goes forward ever shell
surely take you away from me i
cant tell you what awful things shes
told me-things youve said to her
terrible things

  at that he paled and loosed her
hand certainly the corridor was far
too public for this kind of conversa-
tion and yet all he could sense was
the odor of probable triumph-the ex-
altation the exhilaration of winning
out

  never mind the mother that sel-
fish narrow-viewed american grass-
widow who had her little way of
the man-eater



having her little way on all occasions
and under all circumstances

  he was determined that rosamond
veynol must go off with him so that
nma-and everybody else of course
might hear of it all other considera-
tions were forgotten he seized her
hand again

   listen my dear girl he pleaded
 we do love one another weve
said so a thousand times your
mama doesnt want the match and
weve tried to break it off we cant
break it off its too strong for us
we both have found that out

   when i suddenly saw you this
morning i knew it was too strong for
me now you know it too but we
cant put it through in the open so
let us put it through in the only other
way lets run off and at once

  she lifted her eyes to his and he
felt that she would help him to manage
it somehow he didnt stop an in-
stant to consider that perhaps she too
had her triumph to secure rosa-
mond was human too

 there was the world and her
mother and-mrs darling oh es-
pecially there was mrs darling car-
leigh didnt know and nina didnt
know nobody knew in fact but
rosamond veynol

  caryll took her in his arms unre-
sisting and hugged her very close
he had been warned about the corri-
dor but he didnt heed in time

  he was still holding her and his
lipswere pressed tightly to hers when
cecile turned the angle and uttered a
little cry of astonishment

  of course there was no escape

   we-were going to be married
at once carleigh explained stam-
meringly and rosamond nodding
blushed as red as a peony

   i am glad cecile congratulated

   but-but-you see the young
baronet continued one arm still held
possessively about his fiancees waist
 while were delighted that you
should know we arent quite ready to
tell society in general

   i understand perfectly rely on
me to preserve your confidence i
think it is positively lovely

  yes isnt it said rosamond

 caryll and i were made for one an-
other you do understand dont you
dear mrs archdeacon  

   perfectly repeated cecile  by
the bye dear the car has been waiting
for you this half hour if youve
changed your mind-

  rosamond shook her head vigor-
ously  oh but i havent she re-
turned then she said to caryll  im
going over to the manse at ranleigh
copse for a couple of days if youd
care to ride over to-morrow-

  care to he murmured how
can i wait until to-morrow suppose
i run over with you now just to see
you safely there

   wont you be late getting back to
dinner asked the chatelaine of
carfen house  the countess might
you know be annoyed

  carleigh smiled  as the earl has
failed to fit me with pumps he said

 i consider myself excusable would
vou mind explaining for me mv dear
cecile

  of course he drove over to the
manse with rosamond nothing in
the world could have held him back
just then

  and on the way he told her of how
nearly he had lost his life in the fire
and of how her face had come before
him in what he believed was his last
moment

   that should prove beyond every-
thing how i love you dearest he
murmured

   i dont require any proof caryll
tny own she said  i feel it so deep
deep down in the heart of me our
brain knows other things but it is with
our heart that we know the things of
love

  there was a great deal of this sort
of thing on the way over and if the
chauffeur had sharp ears he must have -
been very much amused or - very
much bored


all-story weekly

  love-making is always so infinitely
entertaining to the lovers with every
burning word a fresh delight and yet
how tiresome flat trite stale and un-
profitable to the disinterested yet en-
forced listener

  carleigh got back to cross saddle
ilall in ample time to dress for dinner
and found no less than a dozen pairs
of pumps of varying sizes spread out
on his floor for inspection and selec-
tion

  after dining he redressed and went
up to town by a late train the next
dav he returned his borrowed attire
and then he went down to belling-
down once more for a long and im-
portant conference with his aunt

  it took place in lady bellingdowns
boudoir and this is the way he began
it  rosamond and i are to be mar-
ried within a week and wed like to be
married here

  lady bellingdowns breath wras
quite taken away she couldnt say a
thing so her nephew proceeded
 you see we thought first of going
to the registrar saying nothing to
any one and just slipping off to some
foreign paradise all by ourselves

   but rosamond says she never ex-
pects to be married but once and that
as she has her wedding-gown all ready
and waiting she might as well wear it
and show it

   but i thought- began his kins-
woman and got no farther

   you thought i was in love with
mrs darling he interrupted  so
i- no i wasnt i was fascinated
infatuated but i- of course you
heard about the fire at carfen

   we heard she was horribly burned
do tell me the particulars

   they say shes disfigured he ex-
plained  tier face is all swathed
now

   that will rob her of her power
and she was so beautiful

    yes she was beautiful agreed
carleigh  and she did have power
she could make a man forget his
eternal soul

   nina was wonderful at making
men forget said his aunt kitty
 she made you forget didnt she 

   for a little while then by
purest chance i saw rosamond again
and-well i knew that she was the
only woman j could ever really care for
as ones wife should be cared for she
is an angel

   but her mother

   ah her mother we are going to
keep clear of mrs veynol

   can you

   certainly we must you see i
dont know what it is but she rouses
all the devil there is in me and
then- he paused

 and then lady bellingdown
asked

   then she tells rosamond

   was that how she separated you
before i never exactly knew
u that was at the bottom of it

   and you mean to be married now
-here-without letting her know 

   yes once we are married what
can she do rosies of age you know
she doesnt have to ask any ones con-
sent when she is lady carleigh we
can defy the mater

   but i thought you were going to
keep out of the way

we are if - if we can absence
is better than defiance isnt it
absence may be defiance said his
aunt  i didnt think of it that way
 yes he agreed but he evidently
had some misgiving

   but youre not so certain as you
were a minute ago that you can keep
the place of your absence a secret is
that it

  mrs veynol has an uncanny fac-
ulty of finding things out he con-
fided miserably

   now theres where nina has an
advantage lady bellingdown sug-
gested  she has no mother you
would have had  distressing mother-
in-law

  sir carvll was thoughtful then
 but mrs darling is too old for me
she said so herself
the man-eater

   i suppose thats true nina seems
fixed in her purpose never to marry
fancy a woman saying she is too old
for any man 

   she counts by experience rather
than years possibly one would never
think of age in her case if she didnt
remind one

   shes very lovely said kitty
bellingdown with something of final-
ity  where will you and rosamond
spend your honeymoon she added

   thats just it carleigh returned
with knitted brow  its the one
problem that troubles me honey-
moon places are so devilishly well
known all mrs veynol would have
to do is to keep her eyes on the news-
papers shed spot us within a week
and then-shed follow

   you might travel incognito

   on ones wedding journey nev-
er how can you think of it aunt
kitty dont you see-

   of course i see she broke in
 forgive me it never once occurred
to me

  then they let that question drop
having been frightened away by thus
traying on dangerous ground

  the arrangements for the nuptials
were all completed in the next hour
they were not to be in any w-ise sim-
ple they were to be very imposing
in fact with a whole houseful of
guests hurriedly brought together yet
every one under a strict bond of
secrecy

  rosamond was to stop on at the
manse until the second day be-
fore then she was to withdraw her
trousseau from where it had been so
hurriedly rushed into storage in lon-
don and appear at bellingdown on the
eve of her last day of maidenhood

  lord waltheof was deputed to look
after minor details but lord kneed-
rock could his consent le obtained
was to be best man

  carleigh saw personally to this of
course and encountered no trouble
kneedrock consented without demur
and offered to see his grace the arch-

bishop of highshire and arrange with
him to perforin the ceremony

  and wonder of wonders every-
thing was carried ouj precisely as
planned the septemler day proved
glorious the sun shone on the bride
in good omen and the bride was a
picture of loveliness

  many of the presents returned six
weeks before came back in the same
wrappings and most of the rest would
probably come later when the givers
learned what had happened and how

  but no one - not even lady bel-
lingdown-was given a hint as to the
honeymoon destination of bride and
bridegroom

  they drove away toward london
under a deluging shower of rice and
old slippers and with wrhite ribbon-
yards and yards of it - streaming
from every attachable place on sir
carylls own motor-car

  after they had gone the guests
continued very merry a great quan-
tity of champagne had been consumed
in drinking the health and happiness
of the launched voyagers on the mat-
rimonial sea and every ones spirits
were keyed high

  every ones that is to say except
kitty bellingdowns and kneedrocks

  poor dear caryll sighed his
aunt who like some others always
chose to weep over those that were
given in matrimony  well and so
hes married at last 

  and such a surprise exclaimed
the duke  i say doody wasnt it a
surprise 

  doody didnt say anything she
wras trying a new dance - step with
waltheof

   and so now theres an end to the
gossip contributed charlotte grey

 kneedrock who had his back
turned wheeled around

  oh is there he observed in his
characteristic ringing undertone

  the duchess gave over trying the
dance-step and joined the group

   his mother - in - law will be after
them of course she said  therell

be no keeping it from her such a
dreadful person she is	

   she rides races in boys clothes
put in the duke  she does-doesn t
she doody 

  and slie bathes in one-piece con-
tinental bathing - suits volunteered
waltheof  ive seen her at ostend
ripping figure for the mother of such
a big girl 

   i wonder what will happen next 
mused lady bellingdown who loved
carleigh like a son and was more than
a little frightened

   nina will happen next said lord
kneedrock sotto voce

  he was wondering why it was that
the new lady carleigh reminded him
so much of that ramsay girl he had
met through nina at simla

chapter xxii

the interrupted honeymoon

the carleighs went to madeira
for their honeymoon it is a
popular place for honeymoons
but not so popular as some others be-
cause its farther away

  no one knew but they and they
hoped that the mater wouldnt find
out they didnt in the least see how
she was to find out

  rosamond went so far as to write
her a letter omitting all mention of
her wedding of course dating it from
san remo and sending it there under
cover to a confidential friend to be
mailed to  dear mama who it so
happened was still in dublin

  having thus taken every precaution
to guard against pursuit they threw
care to the winds and reveled in their
new and blissful companionship amid
tropical surroundings

  everything amused them - the na-
tives the bullock-sledges the redes-
hammocks swung on poles and carried
by native bearers

  they explored the long ravine visi-
ble from the windows of their rooms
in the hotel at funchal riding on the

backs of gaily harnessed mules and
sampling the wines of the vineyards
along the way

  of evenings there were always the
botanical gardens with their palms
and rhododendrons and the light-
hearted madeirans making a fiesta of
the hour

  there had been two weeks of it
now - rapturous weeks - with mrs
veynol so far from their thoughts
that even momentary memories had
ceased to obtrude

  they sat in the half light of the
gardens a giant palm nodding above
them a soft breeze in their faces
lovers of another land-but still lov-
ers like themselves - sauntering by
the men swinging malacca-sticks the
womens bright eyes shining beneath
becomingly arranged mantillas and
believed paradise their very own

  and that was the moment that fate
chose for dropping a shadow it de-
scended while their heads were turned
the other way and their first warning
was when a voice they both knew and
recognized instantly fell like the knell
of doom on their joy-attuned ears

   arent you going to kiss mother
son  

  carleigh seemed propelled to his
feet it appeared to him that he came
up with a whirling motion if he
could only have gone on whirling and
rising like certain cardboard toys he
remembered to have seen it would
have been such a satisfaction

  but instead he seemed to whirl
straight into his mother-in-laws open
arms which closed affectionately -
oh so affectionately-around him
and it wasnt at all a nice kiss she
gave him or he gave her

  there was nothing maternal about
it it was so ardent that he felt
ashamed and when he was at length
released and caught sight of rosa-
monds eyes he was more ashamed
than ever he couldnt understand
himself

  he didnt love sibylla veynol he
was sure he didnt he would have
the man-eater



been delighted never to see her again
and he did love her daughter vet
this was the way it had been before

  then their kisses had been in se-
cret now that she had the right she
chose to demand them openly here-
tofore she had told her daughter
things now she meant to show her

   i dont know whether to kiss you
rosamond or not she said  that
letter you sent me from san remo
was a very low piece of work

   but mama - began lady car-
leigh and got no farther

   what must the world think her
mother went on  when it learns you
are married and that i was not bidden
to your wedding

   why mama - the bride at-
tempted once more

   i dont blame caryll in the least
mama continued  i am sure that he
had nothing to do with it he would
have been only too glad to have me
there it was you my ungrateful
daughter-my own flesh and blood-
who was at the bottom of it all

   oh i say- it was carleigh
who made the attempt this time

   no you neednt speak mrs
veynol checked him  you are a
gentleman and wish to take the blame
on your own shoulders but no mat-
ter what you said i shouldnt believe
you fortunately i know my own
daughter at last

   it-it was the only way rosa-
mond faltered

   it was a very wicked way still
i dont see how i am to blame you
caryll is so fascinating it is all  can
do to resist him myself but - oh
dear i had quite forgotten 

  she turned abruptly to where a fair-
haired young man slightly round-
shouldered stood hat in hand behind
her  let me present mr miles
oconnor lady carleigh-sir caryll
carleigh

  rosamond inclined her head and
carleigh bowed a little stiffly mr
miles oconnor withdrew a tenta-
tively advanced hand

   mr oconnor explained mrs
veynol  is the subeditor of british
socicty it was through him that i
located you how he managed it i
dont know i am curious myself
but he tells me it is an office secret
which is equivalent to a secret of the
confessional

  neither sir caryll nor his wife
spoke both would have liked to cut
out the tongue that had betrayed them

   mr oconnor came with me from
london he has been most kind and
considerate i can never hope to re-
pay him

   has british society ceased publi-
cation asked carleigh bitingly

   its a little vacation im taking
ventured the subeditor

   sorry you delayed it so long
rejoined the baronet still more acidly

   we were fortunate enough to se-
cure rooms on the same corridor with
you at your hotel mrs veynol dis-
closed

   mr oconnor again i assume
said carleigh  as capable a courier
as an editor-i mean as a subeditor
 sir caryll is pleased to be iron-
ical snapped the young irishman
boiling

   im not pleased at all sir caryll
replied equivocally  ordinarily i
am most complacent but i cant bear
a sneaking snooting busybody whos
always attending to ever ones busi-
ness but his own

  oconnors fists doubled but mrs
veynol laid a quieting hand on his
curving shoulder

   caryll dear she soothed  rou
are unjust you are really mr
oconnor has served me at great
personal sacrifice i dont know what
i should have done without him
when i learned that rosamond was
not at san remo - had never been
there - i was torn with anxiety
fancy the feelings of a fond mother
i applied to mr oconnor in my ex-
tremity and he proved himself a
friend in need

  carleigh turned away but no less


all-story weekly

vexed in his wifes eyes he saw
tears glistening and they had been

so inexpressibly happy

  he was tempted to allude to british
societys theory of why his engage-
ment had been broken - to inquire
about the convict first husband - his
rosamonds own father-but he re-
sisted the impulse determining never-
theless to thrash out the matter with
mrs yeynol privately at the first op-
portunity

  but there was no opportunity that
evening he managed it however
the following morning he was astir
early leaving rosamond who had
been wakeful from nervousness to
get some compensating slumber

  and he met his mother-in-law as if
by prearrangement in the hotel gar-
dens while the dew was still on leaf
and flower to his delight she was
unattended

   you growr younger every time i
see you he said kissing her hand in
the continental fashion he knew she
liked  you might be rosas sister

  it was odd how against his will such
pretty speeches were wrung from him
bv this woman who in one way re-
pelled him

  they strolled about for a while
and then sat down on a bench which
carleigh did not observe was in full
view from his wifes windows but 
it was

   couldnt you have come here
alone mater he asked it was the
first time he had called her that and
it didnt please her he saw it before
she spoke

    for heavens sake caryll dear
dont she begged you make me
feel a hundred if you cant find a
pet name for me you may call me si-
bylla or sibyl or just sib but ill
hate you if you mater me and i dont
want to hate you i dont really

   no more than i wish to hate
you he laughed  but i will unless
you send that irish bounder about his
business fancy you fetching a cad
like that sibyl--dear 

   but i didnt she protested  it
was he who fetched me he would
find rosamond for me on no other
terms we came by train to lisbon
you know and he never men-
tioned funchal until we were on the
steamer

   hes even more of a cad than i
thought then

   hes in love with me sibylla
said

   and vou have encouraged him
good lord

   for a purpose purely for a pur-
pose

   and after what he did - after
that vile screed he published

  she colored softly  then you
saw it   she asked

   it was sent to me in scotland of
course i knew it wrasnt true i was
tempted to horsewhip the beggar

   but it was true she declared
boldly  that was the worst of it

  and at that carleigh sat suddenly
upright whereas he had been loung-
ing  i never knew it i never
threwr rosamond over for it you
know that

   that was its only inaccuracy
the prison part was quite true your
wifes father is still serving his sen-
tence in the united states federal
prison at atlanta georgia

  and you never told me she never
told me he cried reproachfully

   it w-as a secret we thought buried
why should we have dug it up

   because i was marrying into the
family i was entitled to-

   i had no intention of permitting
you to marry into family you must
grant i did all in my power to stop it
i even resorted to attracting you my-
sell i felt sure that my daughter
would never marry a man who flirted
with her mother it was shameful
perhaps but i could not afford to be
too discriminating

   you had far better have told me
he protested

   you mean that if you had known
you would not have married  
the man-eater



   no i am not sure but i should
have had the chance to consider now
it is too late

  mrs veynol laughed ringingly

   not at all she denied  mar-
riage is the least irrevocable of steps
give my daughter the grounds and 
promise you she will divorce you

   i have messed things up mused
carleigh dismally

   you see ive lost neither time nor
effort to let you know said mrs
veynol as a gentleman though
you will preserve my confidence as
a son-in-law i have told you what i
could not even as a f utur

   but the whole world knows it
he retorted  it has been published
 and it has been denied-retracted
with an apology-a very abject apol-
ogy mr oconnor did it he was
most kind

  carleigh fell to musing again fi-
nally he said  what was your first
husbands name  

   the same as always she an-
swered smiling at his past tense
 he hasnt changed it it was only
i that changed mine and rosamonds
his name is ramsay - j sprague
ramsay

   you divorced him before or after
he went to prison caryll asked

   i divorced him when he went to
prison was her precise answer
 then i took back my maiden name
called my daughter rosamond in-
stead of jane-she had been christened
jane rosamond - and deserted the
world that knew us for cape town
where i met mr veynol and married
him

   you are an ambitious woman
sibyl observed her son - in - law
thoughtfully

   yes i am she admitted candid-
ly  and you see my ambition runs
higher than a mere baronet let the
girl divorce you and ill marry her to
an earl

   but im not going to let the girl
divorce me he had reached a de-
cision  i love her too much and-

his eyes dwelt appraisingly for a mo-
ment on the woman beside him in
her dark spanish almost gipsy way
she held a lure that for the susceptible
carleigh was well - nigh irresistible
 and he added  her mother is far
too fascinating

  mrs veynol laughed but his flat-
tery was not lost  kiss mother
son she commanded and leaned to-
ward him

  he glanced furtively from right to
left not a soul was in sight then
he took her in his arms and pressed
her close and the kiss was that of the
night before over again if anything
it was warmer

  the subeditor left madeira by the
next calling steamer liberally remu-
nerated for his services

  relieved of his presence the car-
leighs and mrs veynol stayed on
they stayed for another fortnight
then they traveled to nice arriving
a little in advance of the season

  no one of them however was
quite happy the serpent had entered
paradise and its sweetest fruits had
turned acrid

  in these days sir caryll talked
more with his mother-in-law than he
did with his wife her experience
was wider and she had more imagi-
nation

  occasionally there were revelations
that were like sudden drops into icy
waters for instance one day when
they had gone to monte carlo to-
gether leaving rosamond at nice
with a headache or some other ill
she surprised him bv saying

   its odd nina darling never told
you of us

  you mean she knew he asked
in astonishment

   im not sure weve never met-
since but we were great friends five
years ago in simla

  it isnt possible she knows
said carleigh

   i wouldnt be certain said the
whilom mrs ramsay she can keep
a secret none better you know


all-story weekly

theres no doubt she shot poor dar-
ling they were alone in the gun-
room together and he couldnt have

done it himself

   ill never believe that he re-
turned

   then youll never believe the
truth

  but why what was her ob-
ject

   she wanted him out of the way
to marry lord kneedrock who was
supposed to be dead but was only
buried for eight years in the south

  nonsense said carleigh she
doesnt love kneedrock never did
ive seen them together ive heard
them both talk and i know

   i told you she could keep a se-
cret said sibylla veynol

  they reuirned to nice before din-
ner and carleigh found his wife
reading

   feeling more fit he asked

   i shall never feel more fit she
answered without looking up from
her book

  you dont mean its incurable
have you had in the physician 

   oh its not physical she replied
petulantly  its mental its the
conditions im sick of everything
you dont care in the least for me any
more you havent since mama came
back you had an assignation with
her in the gardens of the hotel at fun-
chal the very next morning and you
kissed her there under my window i
saw you

  the thing took him so by surprise
that he couldnt muster a single word
for defense

   i do wish youd leave me she
went on  why dont you ask mama
to bolt with you im sure she would
and then id be rid of you both

  he nearly reeled under the shock of
that speech it held him still mute it
was painfully plain that something was
wrong in a social fabric which made it
possible for a wife to say such a thing
-a young and pretty wife too and

to say it without seeming to find it very

heinous

  he noticed that she yawned and
went on reading her book

  when lie fully sensed it all hours
later alone on the promenade he de-
cided to go off but not with  ma-

chapter xxiii
a mysterious widow of bath

just as soon as she could possibly
manage it nina left the dalgries
and alone with her maid hied her-
self to that stupidest of all english re-
sorts-bath

  there she took a flat and secured
two servants and kept herself so se-
cluded that the story went abroad that
the blind beggar in the famous poem
was a beauty beside her

  some said that she was sightless and
some that she had been scarred beyond
all recognition but nobody really
knew because nobody had really seen
her

  nobody that is to say except her
surgeon and his assistant and del-
phine the french maid

  nina chose bath because of this
wonderful surgeon mr pottovv who
was connected with the chief hospital
there and knew more about the skin
and cutaneous affections than any
man in england

  he promised to restore her if res-
toration were possible but he was very
reticent about the method until his
success was assured then he told
her that it had been necessary to resort
to the grafting of new and healthy
skin to take the place of that which
had been scorched practically to a
cinder

   but where did you get it nina
asked deeply interested she knew
that it had not been taken from her
and transplanted

   i was fortunate enough to find a
volunteer answered the surgeon

 i suppose she required some fab-
the man-eater



ulous price nina rejoined but if
it has given me back an unmarred
countenance i shall be only too glad to
pay

   there is nothing to pay mr
pottow told her  he gave it gra-
tuitously and was glad to

  he gave it exclaimed the pa-
tient starting up impelled by flooding
emotions

   yes he

   shall i have to shave   she asked
seriously startled by the dread possi-
bility

   no came the answer with a
smile  the skin wasnt from his
chin therell be no beard to bother
you

   id much rather had it from my
own sex she pouted

   my sex is less selfish said the
surgeon  few women would sacri-
fice their cuticle that an afflicted sister
might regain her beauty

   still i dont like the idea of being
even that much man she insisted  i
have always been so thoroughly - so
entirely feminine

   the cells are constantly renewing
themselves it was the scientist
speaking  you will wear these only
temporarily

  nina thought for a moment then
she said of course i shall pay him

i	shall insist on it

   im sure he wont accept he re-
garded it a great privilege he was
delighted at the opportunity

  and at that she became really
alarmed it was some one she knew
of course it was one or another no
doubt of the army of lovers she had
sent about their business when their
ardor grew too oppressive

  but which one ah that was the
question-which one 

   but youve put me under a terrible
obligation she complained  i think
you should have consulted me mr
pottow before accepting such a sacri-
fice i am very uncomfortable over
it

   you should have been more un-

comfortable disfigured for life he re-
plied sagely

  of course it wasnt nibbetts he
would delight in seeing her hideous
the cabinet minister was out of the
question too hed be sure to get into
the newspapers besides he was very
bitter

  the soldier of fortune was out of
the country and carleigh was mar-
ried and honeymooning the ameri-
can aviator had been killed volplan-
ing

   it might be the poet she said
aloud

   i dont think lies ever been guilty
of sonnets observed pottow  still
we never know hes most interested
now in sheep-raising and in quarrying
freestone

   good heavens cried mrs dar-
ling  he isnt even a gentleman
how could you oh how could you
mr pottow

  he smiled quizzically and excused
himself with  i hadnt any choice
you know to tell the truth ive done
so much of this sort of thing that ive
reduced the visible supply of skin
here in bath to the minimum

   i dont see how he knew me she
went on puzzled  im very seclud-
ed here i dont know a soul in the
place except you

   you know him or did he says
he owes you something and-

  what is his name she demand-
ed interrupting

   i thought youd ask that before
but you wished to place him for your-
self didnt you and im afraid youll
have to you see when he volun-
teered it was on certain conditions
and that he was not to be known in the
premises was one of them

   but youve told me everything but
his name

   that was especially stipulated

  and i am never to be any the
wiser she inquired that seems
hardly fair since i cant pay him i
certainly should be permitted to thank
him


all-story weekly

   ill take your thanks to him

   no  wish to thank him myself

in person

   you want him to come here 

   i want him to come here-just as
soon as i am fit to be seen

   hell come to-day if you say so
he surprised her with

   oh no  no not while im
like this

   but hes seen you worse than this
remember hes been in this room a
dozen-a score of times

   here she exclaimed amazed
of course while your eyes were
bandaged while the transfer was
made

  then he saw how awful i was 
 i fancy he didnt regard you as
awful he seemed-

  but she wouldnt let him go on
 send him this evening she com-
manded  and ill have the lights ar-
ranged so that i can see him while i
myself am veiled by the kindly
shadow

  when the surgeon was gone nina
fell to wondering once more there
were flirtations she had totally forgot-
ten  there was no question about that
but she had always been rather a
stickler for caste and she couldnt at
all reconcile the sheep-raising and the
stone-quarrying with any of her light-
ly amorous adventures

  perhaps after all she had been on
the wrong track certainly she had
been on the wrong track this man
owed her something the perplexing
pottow had said meaning evidently a
debt of gratitude

  then it couldnt be one of those
they were the last persons to think
themselves in arrears of that kind it
must be some one she had befriended
she supposed she had befriended poor
men on occasions but she couldnt re-
call individual cases

  possibly it was a coachman or gar-
dener or one of the tenantry at some
place she had been years gone

  or-why to be sure-some private
from the ranks who hud completed

his service fallen heir to a little farm
and a little quarry here in somerset-
shire and settled down to the prosaic
life of a plodding civilian

  the idea robbed the prospect of the
meeting of most of its interest and
it was the only idea she could accept
she even forgot to tell delphine that
she was expecting a caller and she for-
got too to have the lights arranged as
she had planned

  when therefore her maid came to
her with the announcement that a gen-
tleman was calling-a gentleman who
wouldnt give his name but said that
he came at mr pottows suggestion-
she was not in the least prepared

   does he seem a gentleman del-
phine  she asked interested afresh

   oh oui madatne a young gen-
tleman and good-looking

   have you ever seen him before 
 of a certainty madame here
with m pottow

  but you never heard his name
   never madame

  then hastily she had her arrange
the lights and give her a fan with
which to mask the lower part of her
features where the now healing burns
were still more or less unsightly

  and then she waited-sure still that
she was to be disappointed

  she heard the steps at length in the
passage and fixed her eyes upon the
door but the light was not very good
there either-she had had it concen-
trated as far as possible on the chair
placed for the visitor at least four
yards from her bedside toward the
foot and facing her

  he was in the room now just over
the threshold bowing at what must
have seemed to him just a black
shadow and save that he was tall and
that his figure was gracefully slender
what she saw meant nothing to her
whatever he hadnt even spoken so
there was no voice to recognize

  as he came forward though there
was something in his walk and carri-
age that seemed familiar though she
couldnt place them for the life of her
the man-eater



   do sit down she urged  there
id rather you wouldnt come nearer

  still he didnt speak but he sat
down as she bade him with the light
full on his face and she saw he was
gerald andrews

  it was quite a minute before she
could speak then  you-of all the
persons in the world  she breathed
barely above a whisper

   it is odd that we should meet
again here under such circumstances
he agreed pleasantly amused over her
astonishment  and yet not so sin-
gular either its a tight little island
this and any two persons on it are
more or less likely to run across each
other in time

   but i thought you were still in
india she said

   its three years since i came home
the governor died suddenly and-
well there were things to be looked
after

  nina smiled thinking of what mr
pottow had told her

   wheres little boy blue that looks
after the sheep  she quoted  was
that it 

   yes he answered  the sheep
were part of it but the quarry is the
biggest job

  she wondered how she could be so
rude to him after all he had done
somehow it didnt just seem to her a
gentlemans work but he wasnt
ashamed of it evidently and she was
glad of that

   i read in the newspapers about
your misfortune he told her  im
glad you came to pottow hes the
best man on scars in all england

   scars she repeated remember-
ing but it would be ruder still to ask
him about his she wondered whether
he really did think of her every time
he shaved

   he took an old scar out for me-
a very delicate bit of work too

    how vain you must be  she ex-
claimed

  	xo it was hardly vanity i was
ashamed of it not for what it was but

for what it meant it symbolized cow-
ardice and i was ashamed of that

   remember she said but ill
forget it if youd rather

   i would rather

   youre stronger now arent you
im so glad

  then for the first time came some-
thing of that old boyish lilt in his voice
that recalled the simla days-days
prior to the night of the seasons last
dance at viceregal lodge which
wasnt the end of everything after all

   are you glad really  he asked
delighted  do you care just that
little bit

   indeed i am she told him  i
care a great deal-for your happiness
i want you to be happy

   im hardly that he confessed
 that is i havent been but im
very nearly so this evening

  she must have experienced some lit-
tle emotion for she forgot her fan for
an instant and left her chin unmasked
but she lifted it again almost in-
stantly

   how good rou have been to me 
she murmured  i didnt deserve
such sacrifice

   it wasnt a sacrifice it was a de-
light besides it was the least i could
do to make good for being a cad when
you were in trouble

  even in the shadow he could see
that she didnt understand her eyes
showed him that

   i lost my head he confessed  i
wasnt only weak i was half wild it
was t that told dinghal all youd ever
said to me it was i really who
started the horrid stories that got
about i feel i can never do enough
to wipe that out

  to his surprise she showed no re-
sentment  i dare say that all you
said wasnt half the truth i did kill
poor darling you know

  his brow contracted to a frown

   you didnt he protested  you
couldnt-you couldnt have meant to
if you had any part in it it was acci-
dental


all-story weekly

  she didnt insist all she said was
 i dont see why you should think so
well of me gerald i was perfectly

horrid to you

   were you he asked dreaming
k you were very good to me too x
cant forget that i dont want to
its that and that only i care to re-
member

   would you think it good of me it
i should let you come every day to see
me she asked suddenly with fresh
impulse  its a privilege ive allowed
no one

  oh will you he cried delight-
ed  i zvould be glad

   ive seen no one but mr pottow
you know not even my oldest dearest
friends not my own people

  his smile was rapturous

   i know it he said  have you
heard what you are called here no
well you are  the mysterious widow
of bath 

  isnt that funny she laughed
fancy how dull i have been you
will come and amuse me wont you
gerald

   every day and if ever i bore
you or youd rather not see me say
so youll do that 

   ill do that and -she hesitated
just an instant- and you mustnt
neglect your sheep or your freestone
you know if you dont come ill
know a lamb has strayed from the fold
and youre out on the hill looking for
it do you carry a crook  

   my shepherds do he said sol-
emnly

   send me some south-down mut-
ton gerald im so fond of chops
and at that he laughed

   im not going to be teased he
said and stood up but nina made
him sit down again she was enjoy-
ing his call so much she made him
stay another hour

  lie came every day after that as she
bade him she usually set the hour
herself and he arrived on the minute

  as he was leaving one afternoon he
heard voices in the vestibule the

housemaid was sending away an in-
sistent caller

   mrs darling doesnt see any
one he heard her say

   but im sure shell see me the
persistent male voice continued  you
just take her my card

   she forbids me to fetch cards re-
joined the housemaid  im sorry
sir

  he heard the jingle of silver coin
the caller was about to resort to bri-
bery as a privileged one out of com-
passion for nina he would lend his
aid he might pretend he was the at-
tending surgeon or physician and that
it was by his orders that the patient
was denied visitors

  he drew the door which was slight-
ly ajar wider he made a third in the
vestibule and then he recognized the
caller it was lord kneedrock

  nibbetts recognized him too he
shrugged his hulking shoulders and
thrust his handful of coins back into
his pocket then he turned to the
housemaid again

   i understand he said in his pene-
trating undertone  i quite under-
stand mrs darling sees no one

  then he reopened the outer door
and stalked lumberingly away

chapter xxiv

the disinterested married man

there was a house-party at pud-
dlewood and all the kinsfolk and
friends who haunted belling-
down were there

  whos seen nina asked the
duchess

   no one answered waltheof la-
conically

   too bad when shes so entertain-
ing said the duke  i always say
theres no one like nina i say doody
dont  say theres nobody like nina 

   everybody knows what you think
of mrs darling affirmed the duchess
calmly  but i do wonder what she
looks like 
the man-eater



  charlotte grey had been to bath
but had not succeeded in seeing the
recluse she got as far as delphine
and that was all

   madame ne regoit personnel said
the french maid

   nibbetts has been too said kitty
bellingdown  and he was equally
unsuccessful

   i thought shed have seen you
ventured the duchess

   i thought so too but it appears
not returned kneedrock gloomily

  meanwhile the carleigh split-up had
occurred but the fact had not yet
reached this bureau of family and
friendly counsel

  strolling ruminantly on the prom-
enade at nice carylls heart turned
thirstily toward the giver of oblivion

   i dont care what she looks like
i must see her he said and he left
by that nights paris rapide

  on the journey to bath he did a
great deal of thinking he hadnt
been happy for weeks-not since the
night mrs veynol came so suddenly
into his paradise in madeira

  it is idle for a man to hope to keep
his perfect balance in a desperate flir-
tation with his own mother-in-law
one might as well contemplate tight-
rope feats on a newly thrown and con-
sequently not firm rope

  carleigh realized that he hadnt
made any manner of success of the
task and the worst of it was that his
wife didnt in the least care

  when sibylla had killed her daugh-
ters betrothal the daughter had re-
belled slightly she had been pale-
but she appeared happy

  now however when the marriage
had gone under she exhibited neither
reluctance nor grief she did not re-
sent losing her husband in the least
she only yawned and said  why
dont you bolt with mama  and then
read further

  it was all very distressing-exceed-
ingly distressing but now he was
nearing bath and nina and that
meant consolation

  nina receiving his card experienced
a rush of vivid anticipation is there
any situation so piquant as that of
meeting the man one did not marry
after he has  hashed it  with another
woman 

  her embargo had been lifted that
morning and the precious new skin-
partly geralds partly her own-
which the specialist had worked so
hard to foster into beauty was at last
firm enough to stand the gaze of the
most critical of all judges - the man
that one might have married

  carleigh waiting in the drawing-
room was far more nervous than she
was he had been told that she was
horribly disfigured and he expected to
find her so

  now he could hear her step in the
passage she was outside there in the
chill hall then the latch clicked the
portiere swung and-he was rising to
touch nina darlings hand again

  after all these months the bed-
room and the bandages rushed back
upon his memory and he was prepared
to need self-control when he should
look up but when he did look up he
saw with a curious jump in his heart
that she was not scarred

  then in the same instant that he
realized she wras unchanged he knew
himself to be greatly changed-brand-
ed on brow as well as in soul and he
felt that through and through

  he took her hand-both hands-in
his and gazed thirstily into her eyes-
a serene violet-blue

   ive blundered too he said as
a greeting  ive made an unhappy
marriage too now i have more
sympathy ior you than i had but she
never plays with guns unfortunately

  he laughed really quite gaily for
he was most awfully glad to feel her
hand in his again and she laughed
as well

   its funny how people talk isnt
it she said of course i never
had anything to do with it but people
like to talk-after all these years too
it was just an accident


all-story weekly

  and it was just the only clay that
she had insisted the reverse but that
was to another man-a different type
of man	

  he laughed and put his arm about
her  kiss me dear he said  im
so very unhappy

  if she had averted her head he
would have been her slave afresh but
she didnt avert her head instead she
kissed him placidly-so placidly that
he almost started

   you see youre married now she
told him and drew her hand out of his
and went and sat dowtn

  he felt stunned and sick it was
as if there was no bottom anywhere
for a little but then he remembered

   nina he said calling her again
that which in all the fervor of his
nomenclature during the passionate
passed-by period he had so often
voiced  nina ive come to ask a
sreat kindness at vour hands-two in
fact

  she sat quiet staring at him with
those lash-veiled eyes that had driven
him and so many many others not
quite mad and had the lesson he had
spent months conning in such a hell
as may exist amid our earthly sur-
roundings been a bit less bitter and
thorough he must have felt that near-
madness course in his veins again but
he was seared so that no near-madness
was for him any more

   how youve changed  she ob-
served not seeming to notice his
speech and speaking herself in a
certain tone of absolute childlike
wonder which was not the least of
the weapons in her arsenal of per-
sonal persuasion  why youve lines
across your forehead-at your age
too lines that i can see even from
here

  never mind he said and then
some impulse led him to go over and
kneel beside her conscious only of an
acute wonder as to what would come
next  never mind dear girl listen
to me

  she put her hand upon his head

 and white hairs she pursued
tracing them with an astonished fin-
ger  at your age too one-five
why i can count eight

   never mind he repeated pulling
down the impertinent finger and won
dering as he did so that its fresh
imprisonment left him so pitifully
piteously unthrilled  never mind-

 dont care what  look like any 
more

   its all so futile--life is so empty
-things seem to me so very very
trivial what are wrinkles beside
things-untellable things-that stone
ones immortality and make one wish
that on the judgment day god him-
self wouldnt know

  even as he spoke he caught himself
questioning whether she believed him
-whether his words stirred any feel-
ing in her

  she dropped her eyes and pulled
her hand free

   i know what you mean she said
in a toneless voice  i had such se-
crets too but theyre not what
people fancy them to be people think
i killed my husband but i didnt i
did what youve done-what we all
do i killed myself

  he looked at her it was such a
pitiless relentless glare-that into
which her words thrust his conscious-
ness

   i cant believe that yours were like
mine he said miserably  no one
can ever have done what i have done
yes youre right-and it has killed
me

  she didnt seem greatly interested

   but i didnt come to talk of that
he exclaimed quickly  i came to ask
of you two things will you grant
them  

she turned her head leaving only
her profile showing  certainly not
she said  i will grant you nothing
you mustnt say that you dont
know what im asking

   youre married she told him

 and i wont have a thing to do with
you t hate the love-making of mar-
the man-eater



ried men its dangerous too for they
always talk

  that dull heavy red that had been
crimson before he took on chains stole
over his face

   ill tell you without asking then
he said  it may not be the great and
tremendous thing to you that it is to
me i think perhaps that you may
even laugh

   very likely she assented

  he rose and went to the chimney-
piece and stood there striving for
greater quietude it was a long mo-
ment-minutes long

  then finally he threw over his
shoulder  nina you must hear me
im going away im going to cut it
all suetonius was pretty bad but you
can be tracked by a mother-in-law until
life becomes hideous i-

   but everybody knew why your be-
trothal wras called off she said with
simple finality and then you delib-
erately married the girl even after
that

   i know-i know-i know he
cried in irritation but those things
must be written in the book of fate
some curses must be launched beyond
recall at any rate its done we
both know that

   yes we know that she agreed
simply

   and now i am going away and
im not sure that i shall ever return
but i want an object in going and i
would rather have it something in
connection with you than anything
else on earth ive thought what i
want to do and i wish youd give me
permission to do it

  of course there was a man you
loved and of course you love him yet
equally of course he accounts for
everything and of course hes still
alive or youd be a better woman tf
he w as dead hed have a hold over you
that would keep you straight

how funny for you to know all
that she exclaimed opening her
eyes very wide  you certainly have
been learning then she broke forth
 a-s

into laughter  and if it were the
duke now 

   dont laugh he cried angrily
  tell you im in earnest i know
that theres a man and that hes
somewhere well then i want to go
where he is and to see him face to
face and to try to right whatever
separates you ive got to get away-
and far away-and ill be able to
build some sort of respect for myself
if i know that ive a good purpose
and a clean mission

  she wasnt laughing now he was
very much in earnest and she had
caught some of his seriousness it
was contagious

   i understand what persons like
you and me can suffer and how much
they need help and how the mock of
love unfulfilled can drive them into
hideous rocks and sink them in a
seething whirlpool of temptations i
can read your life like a book now
-can read it by the lurid light of my
own burning wreck and so i know
that whatever might happen you
would be forgivable and its what
i know-what i have learned-that i
want to tell him and whatever is
wrong-if he believes it-if i can
make him believe- however it-
and there he stopped-broke off ab-
ruptly

  nina was staring at him hard

  he had spoken so fast and in such
a passion of pleading that he appeared
to be for the moment breathless she
sal there before him in the low chair
she had chosen and her eyes were
fixed on him

  he had poured forth the last
phrases with his head bowed and his
hands gripping the edge of the velvet-
draped shelf behind him

  it was she who spoke next

   there is no one for you to go to
she said- no one in all the wide
world as to my husband it was a
kind of accident but really i didnt
care if it hadnt been all my crimes
are against myself ive injured no
one else do you understand


all-story weekly

  lie nodded dumbly feeling rather

blank

  there is no  man  in my life
she went on  i never have  loved 
a women are supposed to love ive
just liked men-liked them as such-
that was all

  she paused briefly looking at him
expecting some word but he was
silent

   ive never been really bad she
continued  ive never wanted to be
bad but i like to be kissed and ive
been so unhappy through just sheer
loneliness that i could only remember
a few of the commandments and the
marriage service not at all

  sir caryll carleigh stood very still
there trying to read her meaning in
her face but failing

   pretty nearly every one thinks i
was in love with kneedrock she
pursued presently  you may ask
him about that if you like and they
think that we made way with poor
darling between us but they are
wrong

  she paused again in doubt whether
or not to say more-whether or not
to tell the truth-the whole truth-as
she had never told it before carleigh
neither urged nor encouraged but of
her own free will she decided it was
due him in a wav and frank confes-
sion might probably be the best thing
for her she had carried the burden
alone now for five years always
growing heavier and the temptation
to share it was too much for her

   he was cleaning his gun you
see -that was how she began it just
that simply- and a cartridge shell
stuck in the barrel he tried to get
it out and then he held it-the gun
i mean-and asked me to try-with a
sharp thing you know he thought
that it was an empty shell and so did
i but it wasnt that was all

  carleigh shivered ever so slightly
 you cannot say that you didnt kill
him then he declared

  she pursed her lips a bit thought-
fully already she felt better she

had not misjudged the effect-she was

relieved

   no because of course i did but
on the other hand of course i didnt
anyhow it mattered very little i was
so mad over life and living that his
death seemed a very small event to
me i couldnt remember a thing at
first

   the shot seemed to have stunned
my memory but it all came back later
-horridly the scene i mean yet
the event-the fact that poor darling
was gone-appeared of so little im-
portance and i foolishly expected
the world to see it as i did

   but the world didnt 

   no  she shook her head quite se-
riously- the world chose to talk and
has talked ever since so very stu-
pidly too

  carleigh felt dazed ninas view-
point was very puzzling at times

   and yet i understand he said
seizing  the most obvious end of
the tangle  i dont suppose id-
you see i have been so close to
desperation myself - i dont suppose
id care either if- but he got no
further

  nina hooked her fingers together
tightly behind her head

   i wouldnt think such thoughts if
i were you she said quite gravely
 you know if you do the chance
comes and then you do something
-and god-only god-will ever
measure you by what you really did
mean

  then she looked at him very in-
tently and went  with great impres-
siveness both of tone and emphasis
 i did give a most awful jab with that
sharp tiling and the cartridge ex-
ploded and killed my husband and-
t was glad so of course i am a
murderess at heart dnt you see

   yes i see said carleigh som-
berly

   and that was my crime she con-
tinued- that i wanted to do it and
the results havent mattered so much
what matters is that i wanted to do
the man-eater



it thats all that matters all that
can ever matter

   i understand said the man his
voice so low that the words were bare-
ly articulate	n
there was a long grim silence
which grew oppressive

    its years ago is it not  he asked
then

  five years she answered its
not a pretty story is it how the
duchess enjoys telling it what she
knows and what she thinks and shes
my great-aunt fancy what fun it has
afforded the rest of the world 

   that is unworthy of you car-
leigh rebuked under his breath - to
rail about the horror that has blighted
your life i cant laugh over horrors
they turn me cold in the night

   ah but ive grown used to mine
she returned lightly  and besides
it wasnt so bad as what followed-as
the realizing that i could never be clean
again i wonder if all those whove
sinned as i have sinned are trying to
till an empty life as ive been trying 
he moved to a seat sank down and
clutched his head between his hands
 but love wasnt killed in you-you
find pleasure in men it has been in
me

  she whirled in her seat so sudden-
ly that he started

  good heavens she cried you
dont fancy that i get any real joy out
of flirting do you why its only to
pass the time i never forget for one
second i-i couldnt

  there was another silence-briefer
ihis time-and then carleigh rose a
bit heavily

   youre horribly human you
know he said  i dont know what
to say or what to do i know only that

i	long more than ever for you you
-you couldnt care for me again i
suppose

  she began to laugh  oh you very
manlike man she cried as if i
didnt know that was what you came
for no i couldnt ever care for
you no not possibly

  there was a tap on the door and the
housemaid entered with a card for
nina who knew whose name it bore
before she glanced at it

  certainly wilson she said
 show mr andrews in at once

the interested married man

lord kneedrock lived when

 he was in town in a small suite
in st jamess square

  here carleigh came on a bright
morning three days later to find
kneedrock in the little sitting-room
reading before a fire three windows
open and two dogs asleep at his feet

  they talked for half an hour before
the visitor reached his point

   she told me all he said then
 i suppose its fairest to say outright
that she told me all

  kneedrock didnt look at him he
was smoking his pipe and his gaze
fixed itself  the curling clouds of
smoke that eddied in the cross-cur-
rents of air from the open windows

   i suppose that she told you she
was to blame eh   he drawled after a
moment

   she said that she hadnt cared
what happened

   it isnt a pretty story no matter
how you look at it the viscount ob-
served putting his reflections into
words  two desperate persons who
didnt care what happened poor dar-
ling he didnt care what happened
either dont you know ive often
wondered if he didnt load the thing
and call her to manage the discharge

  carleighs eyes were fascinatedly
fixed on the flames in the grate-little
blue dancing devils of light whose
heat was overpowered by the chill
from outside

   i thought of that too he said
grimly

  poor darling kneedrock went
on musingly  i saw him before any
one else the smoke hadnt cleared

away his face was quite gone you
know it was awful

   good god

  there was a little pause and then

the older man said

   what horrible things go on in the
world anyhow 

   yes the other said simply

  	saw him after that though
pursued kneedrock  in his coffin
tricked out in his dress uniform a
handkerchief spread where his face
used to be and his head on a silk pil-
low he looked very peaceful glad
it was all over i dare say

  carleigh only nodded still looking
at the fire and then there was an-
other pause which kneedrock broke
eventually with  were awfully
primitive    still ninas story
wasnt strictly primitive it was all
warped and twisted by civilization

   in the stone age things would have
been different the troglodyte would
have clubbed darling and later if the
ladv played tricks he would have end-
ed her in the same way thats how to
manage women

  he stretched out his iron hand and
wrist and looked at them - his right
hand and wrist not the scarred ones
 i hate civilization he said then
suddenly  i hate honor and no-
blesse oblige and all such tommyrot
its the ruin of the race

  ite spoke slowly now but with a
frightful bitterness

  	yes said carleigh sympathy
swelling quick  weve gone a long
way from the truth of existence

   it isnt any use going on a wild-
goose chase after happiness in these
times kneedrock went on  you
cant cure your ills nowadays i tried
to help myself once and made the
worst kind of a mess of it go back
to your wife or go off with your
mother-in-law but dont imagine that
either course is going to help you to
happiness because it isnt

  carleigh was looking nibbetts
straight in the eyes now

   and yet he said frankly  i

think that i could be happy-quite
happy-with mrs darling

   no you couldnt returned the
viscount sharply - gruffly in fact
 you couldnt shes too shallow
 shallow 

   yes shallow she has no depths
-of feeling or anything else her
whole life shows that she was too
pretty when she was young she led
lier husband a devil of a dance and
shell never reform

   you must go after some other
trail or grail or whatever you choose
to call it you can never either help
kina or get her take my word for
that

  carleigh who wasnt in any sense
a strong character felt depressed at
the words kneedrock who was a
very strong character relit his pipe
and waited after a little the other
said

   do you by any chance know a
man named andrews  

   i know one andrews answered
kneedrock and this time he held out
his left hand and wrist  it was he
who gave me that he added indica-
ting the healed wound  the night be-
fore poor darling was shot

  in india

   in india

   what sort of a chap 

   tallish rather good-looking
brown eyes and hair young was in
the civil service

  carleigh looked puzzled  i won-
der if it could have been the same
he asked half to himself  i met him
at mrs darlings the day i called

   oh i dare say said kneedrock
non-committally  hes followed her
after five years once one gets the vi-
rus in ones blood its likely to break
out any time so andrews is at
bath 

   he seemed to be quite at home
 doubtless he is nina can make
one feel that way he was very much
at home in the darling bungalow at
umballa just before he fired at me
he and nina seemed to be sharing a
the white gorilla



single chair you see i was there on
a spying expedition

   you mean- queried carleigh
he couldnt just reconcile kneedrock
and the word

   id heard that darling was cruel
to her and i traveled all the way from
tuamota to the punjab to find out
sir caryll held his peace and knee-
drock added  of course i found it
was the most unwarranted slander
darling was a saint

  he got up and closed the three win-
dows then he poked the coals and
took a place on the hearth rug with his
back to the grate the dogs still slept

   so shes amusing herself with an-
drews again eh  he chuckled  re-
calling those halcyon days of blood-
shed i suppose

   perhaps said carleigh thought-
fully  now after all these years shell
marry him

   oh no she wont flashed from

kneedrock who was smiling  she
cant you know

 i dont see why not the other re-
joined  shes her own mistress
shes of age and a widow and of
sound mind

the viscount maintained a rather
disconcerting silence for the space of
several seconds puffing at his pipe and
following the smoke with is eyes then
he patted the head of the nearest dog
with the toe of his boot

when finally he spoke it was to
ask  did you ever hear me spoken
of as her lover 

 yes answered carleigh sur-
prised beyond words

kneedrock raised his head and his
eyes as they rested for a moment upon
sir carylls were curiously devoid of
expression

 i was lie said with a sort of dry
grimness  im more than that-im
her jiusband

to be concluded next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and that
you will get the conclusion of this story without waiting a month

or eight months no word
came from my friend van
dam

   those of us in his debt
virtuously assured our-
selves that we had intend-
ed to pay him back at once
and tried to bear up others who
wished to borrow were naturally some-
what resentful at his absence as

usual he had given no intimation of
his flitting and all who called at his
diggings-so he designated the enor-
mous top-storv apartment where he
dwelt among his countless trophies and
collections - were met by the always
smiling jap with the information
 mr van dam he will be back-oh
quite soon some day

  this same phrase had excused a


all-story weekly

two years disappearance of his master
in the interior of borneo gradually
we ceased to think of him and each
little life traveled around its own re-
stricted orbit as though the absentee
had ceased to exit

  mv own affairs were going rather
well and orders simply poured in this
halcyon tate was due to a hercules
for which van had provided me with
an extraordinary model and a pitts-
burgh millionaire bought because it
was tiie image of a fellow steel worker
he had known in his undollared youth

  these orders however were entire-
ly for portraits which i do not like
doing - my forte is large allegorical
canvases though van thinks different-
ly-but never having had any money
 developed a lust for it and painted
all who paid my most lucrative com-
mission had just come to me a por-
trait for a political club of one of its
most prominent-and worst-mem-
bers and it was giving me a great deal
of trouble to begin with the man
would not sit more than fifteen min-
utes at a time and his face was sim-
ply horrible

  i painted it first nearly from mem-
ory in all its brutal reality of low
forehead eyes set far back and enor-
mous jaw development - a positively
bestial thing and it looked not the
slightest like the original

  then i conceived the idea that a soul
was shining through this fleshy mask
and put the light of holiness in the
eyes the curve of renunciation at the
corner of the lips when my man
called his own face made its painted
counterpart look like the delineation
of some kindly saint that day i de-
voted myself solely to the hands-
veritable gargantuan paws they were
-and after he had left very discour-
aged started to scrape and turn the
face just as  had eliminated all but
chin and forehead the phone rang

  hello i said crisply into the
transmitter with the intonation i have
adopted since i consider myself a suc-
cessful artist

   come to dinner painter-man
drawled vans voice over the wire  i
have something to show you

   im very busy i answered loftily
 but ill try to manage it if youll tell
me lie forehand what we are eating
van has one idiosyncrasy that is
positively ghastly lie is always cook-
ing the most awful uncivilized dishes
concealed in such delectable sauces that
you cant help liking them till you find
out what they are at his table i have
eaten a lizard creature tasting exactly
like delicate chicken and a savory dish
of what appeared to be roasted oysters
and was really the larvre of the black
palm weevil

   what are you busy with came
over the wire if its a vulcan i
have a good model for you

   im trying to paint a baboon i
snapped  and no model will do

   surprising he answered in really
animated tones  i can furnish you
with a gorilla and i have a young
cannibal here to go writh it

   am i to act as a meal for your
guests  i began but he had hung up

  van and i dined luxuriously on
what i took to be very young lamb and
afterward adjourned to the den on the
walls of which are ranged the cases
containing his albino collection - the
traditional white blackbird the enor-
mous glittering white toucan the
snowy racoon the white panther and
that last acquisition in a huge case by
itself there was a roaring wood fire
and before it partially covered by a
snow-leopards skin twitched while
he slept the coffee-colored slim can-
nibal boy once he reached up a long
bare foot and scratched his ear exactly
as a dog attends to a flea

  there was a livid five-inch scar on
vans cheek anti while he talked the
blood would pulse to its top run down
underneath the skin and disappear
exactly as an electric advertising sign
lights and flashes out

   of course you know painter-
man he began  that i am in touch
the white gorilla



with people throughout the world
whom i pay to keep their eyes open
tor the albino phase in animals and
birds the mail daily brings me of-
fers of specimens or word where they
may be procured but for the most
part they are of species i already have
or else out-and-out fakes-i have been
offered scores of white elephants
vou see among savages the abnormal
in nature is very often an object of
direct worship

   contrary to our ideas of religion
the untutored savage has the delicacy
not to inflict his beliefs on strangers
and does not so to speak wear his god
on his sleeve it is therefore hard to
get reliable information regarding ani-
mals that are white when they normal-
ly should be quite a different color

   it wras as a matter of fact the
very indefinitiveness of the data that
sent me on this last expedition from
libreville in the french congo an
englishman w-rote me it was common
talk among the mpangwe who had re-
cently been driven out of the region
at the headw-aters of the gabun river
that their conquerors worshiped and
sacrificed to a white woman who
walked on her knees and elbows and
was covered with long hair a dutch
trader sent word from booue that the
fan tribe of cannibals had an old old
man for chief wrho walked on all fours
and was fed entirely on human flesh
a french rubber exploiter in the sierra
de crystal told one of my agents that
there was a large white monkey in the
ogowe division of the fan cannibals
which was held sacred and accom-
panied them to war

   the very meagerness of this in-
formation and the improbability of
collusion between its widely separated
sources gave me something on which
to theorize and i sailed for libreville
the building of my theory was sim-
plicity itself thethird informant had
distinctly stated that the creature was
a white monkey monkeys are regard-
ed by many tribes in africa as only
slightly modified human beings

   the final link in my reasoning
came from the statement that it walked
on its elbows and knees the gorilla
walks or rather swings itself along
on the back of its hands-the wrist
we would call it-and often turns the
toes of its feet under in short i
hoped for an albino gorilla and my
theory was strengthened by the knowl-
edge that gorillas when caught young
are docile and easily tamed in spite of
the unquestioned ferocity of the wild
old males as a matter of fact we
know little more about this largest of
all primates than has been vouched us
from the fertile imagination of paul
de chaillu

   there are current in africa tales
of men snatched from the ground to
die a horrible death in the tree-tops
of an african tribe that kept a huge
old male for executioner until it was
killed by an englishman about to be
sacrificed who noticed a swelling over
its heart and struck it in this vulnerable
spot at any rate i had never seen a
gorilla in the wild state and the ad-
venture promised many thrills

   from libreville i made a short ex-
pedition among the mpangwe whom
the more warlike fans had driven from
the interior savages i have found
mr painter-man belong to twro cate-
gories those that are honest trust-
worthy and truthful and those that
are the exact opposite

   the mpangwe belong to the latter
class they were the worst liars i
have ever met and told me only what
they thought i wanted to hear the
hairy woman was endowed with wrings
and made to lay eggs that hatched into
serpents and when they found it was
a monkey i was after they agreed to
a man jhat she always assumed that
form at night

   there was nothing to be learned
from these swindling blacks and i
made up my mind to lolknv rumor to
its source and go up the gabun river
into the gorilla country where dwelt the
ogowe fans the local french gov-
ernment not without a warning against

its unsettled state and the absolute lack
of positive knowledge of the region into
which  proposed to penetrate finally
gave me a permit tor a scientific ex-
ploring expedition

   they even went further and pro-
vided me with a guard of twenty sol-
fliers - so you see  traveled rather
en prince - and helped to collect the
rather large caravan which i required

  a trip of this nature to one who has
been through the same kind of thing
before contrary to the general idea of
you city dwellers is remarkable only
for the length of time it takes to reach
a given point there was of course
the usual revolt of the porters for
higher pay which had to be summarily
quelled the leopard that blundered into
my tent-ropes one night and the kill-
ing of a man by a wounded buffalo
also an ill-advised attempt to assassi-
nate me these are only the incidents
one expects in jungle travel how-
ever and on the whole it was rather
a dull journey and a very hot one

   as we neared our destination the
country became rugged with open but
shady and damp forests and there
were interminable thickets of scita-
mines and tree-ferns on the fruits of
which the gorilla feeds all along the
route i made guarded inquiries about
my quest and from what i could not
learn fully made up my mind that a
white gorilla or at least some extraor-
dinary animal its existence well known
to the natives was in possession of the
fans i came to this conclusion be-
cause every approach to the subject no
matter how indirect instantly inspired
fear and those interrogated either be-
came dumb or lied wildly

   one days journey from our des-
tination i sent ahead runners with
gifts to the sorcer so is designated
the local priest and to the chief of
course word of my coming had long
ago preceded me and partially
through curiosity partially through
respect for my guard and my large
caravan they sent back friendly mes-
sages

   the next evening to the monoto-
nous beat of tom-toms i pitched camp
on the edge ol the valley in which
dwelt the ogowe fans these sav-
ages were quite different from any i
had met in africa they were not
black but coffee-colored well made
with thin lips intelligent faces and
were tall and according to our stand-
ards excessively slim

   best of all their language was a
slight variation of the great bantu
tongue as spoken by the zulu kafirs
and with which  am thoroughly fa-
miliar the women who were quite
handsome worked in the manioc-
fields while the existence of the men
was made up of w-ar and hunting to
a high degree they were both truthful
and honorable

   savages love ceremony and our
mutual greetings took up all of three
days on the last of which there was
a feast with wild dances and much
palm-wine i was not at all sure of
the bill of fare and in order to be on
the safe side pretexed a vow of fast-
ing an expiatory rite which they
practise and so understood my
role was that of a sorcer who had
come to study their birds and beasts
but most to consort with my brother
priests to our mutual advantage and
i was accepted at my own valuation

   a liberal gift insured me the privi-
lege of dwelling in their country as
long as i pleased and so well did i
get on with my hosts that finally with
the chief i went through that not un-
poet ic ceremony of mysterious origin
which they call blood - brotherhood
this practical adoption into the tribe
so reassured me as to my safety that
i sent back my guard of soldiers
much to their horror and in spite of
their protestations and with them the
greater part of my porters retaining
only a few in whom i had implicit
confidence

   ive lived with savages before
mr painter - man and i must say
there is no pleasanter or easier life
to a very great extent every man does
the white gorilla



exactly as he pleases food is the only
real necessity and is largely furnished
by the labor of the women

   moral and ethical considerations
are never personal but the affair of
the high priest better called sorcer
and are left entirely in his hands

   in spite of ideal conditions for
happiness it was distinctly wanting
among the ogowe fans there was
an undercurrent of dissatisfaction
running through the tribe and an
atmosphere of mental discomfort
quarrels were frequent and there
were several cases of absolute insan-
ity the victims of which were prompt-
ly put to death tribal law permitting
of no mental or physical deficient

   in my assumed character it was
naturally the sorcer that i saw the
most of and we found much in com-
mon as a matter of fact the priest
among savages represents not only
the highest mental but what we must
characterize for want of a better defi-
nition as scientific attainments of the
race my confrere of the ogowe
fans was a shrewd niddle-aged man
leaning toward asceticism and a real
fanatic in his beliefs

   he had one daughter and if you
can imagine such a thing as a soft
brown rose glowing in the tropical
jungle you will have a fairly accurate
picture of her the fan faith was a
kind of pan-deism with just a dash
of sun worship interwoven with su-
perstition its manifestation interpre-
ted by the sorcer from the actions of
various sacred animals there was
also an additional and very unusual
way of learning the wishes of their
deity

   the priest was master of a crude
but none the less effective form of
hypnotism which he practised 
members of the tribe but principally
on his daughter through her while
she was  possessed of the spirit
otherwise in a cataleptic state he un-
consciously impressed his own will on
the tribe

   i give him absolute credit for at-

tributing divine origin to the words
that she uttered which made him only
the more determined in his purposes
in the same way that a man with an
honest belief is much more likely to
be successful than one who must ad-
mit in his own heart that he is a faker

   the girl was so completely under
his mental control that a few mo-
ments gazing into a large crystal
which had been roughly rounded and
held a thousand lights made her mind
blank and instantly receptive of to any
impression from him this crystal
was a very sacred thing and it was
the duty of a different warrior each
day to rub at the inequalities with fine
sand with the purpose of finally bring-
ing it to a perfect roundness

   the sorcer was enough of a man
of the world to appreciate the awe he
might inspire by means of a few
chemicals i gave him and the-to sav-
ages - startling tricks i was able to
teach him as a matter of fact he
ruled these frankly cannibal warriors
through fear alone and so great was
his mental dominance that at times it
seemed to me he held half the tribe
in a semihypnotic state there was a
bitter feud between him and the tem-
poral chief

   the latter wished to move on to
new conquests the priest held firm
that they remain where they were for
a year until expiation had been made
-by endless religious ceremonies for the
 blinding of the eyes of piety a
phrase which meant nothing to me
then but which i now understand

    i was of course more or less af-
filiated with the chief since with him
i had gone through the blood-broth-
erhood rite but my closest friend was
his son he was a youth of some
twenty summers and the most mar-
velous hunter and tracker i have ever
known ikstu - that is as near as i
can anglicize his name-accompanied
me on all my collecting expeditions
and what was of the greatest impor-
tance since i was supposed to know
them instinctively told me the birds


all-story weekly

and animals that were sacred and nut
to be molested

   chief among- those tabu were the
gorillas and they throve and were
quite unafraid under such treatment
though naturally rather retiring beasts
in the manioc-fields which the women
cultivated toward evening  have lit-
erally seen dozens of them the males
would wander out from the jungle
with their two or three mates and
family or sometimes  would come
upon a solitary old bachelor grayish-
white and a very dangerous animal
to approach

   some would run away screaming
with fright in a trvingly human man-
ner but there was one old fellow who
never gave a step until  myself re-
tired

   he was fully six feet tall when
standing braced against a tree-trunk
his hands hanging below his knees
the hair on his neck and head erect
with rage and the ruff under his chin
quivering two great canine teeth
protruded from each side of his snarl-
ing mouth and beneath their enor-
mous protuberances his little eyes
blazed red in his coal-black face i
learned to hate that animal and as he
hopped away on all fours his legs
swinging out beyond his anus i
longed to turn and put an explosive
bullet in him

   policy that was even a question
of personal safety held me in check
however and i wisely refrained
ikstu who feared nothing else in the
world was deadly afraid of these old
males but even more than he feared
them he hated the sorcer

   as we became better acquainted
and i gained his confidence the reason
for this was apparent i noticed that
on several occasions we found two
purple orchids their stems crossed
lying in the narrow trails through the
scitamines thickets and each time this
sign appeared i lost my companion
tor the rest of the day the connec-
tion was obvious

   the daughter of the sorcer-priest

always wore these orchids in her hair
and as a garland-in fact they formed
by far the greater part of her ward-
robe

   always however she was back
from these love rambles at her fathers
hut before sunset and after he had
made her gaze for a few moments into
the sacred crystal she would hurry off
into the jungle with a basket of ma-
nioc and fruit of the scitamines on her
arm you may well believe  was
curious in regard to these expeditions
but i kept this curiosity to myself
once  tried to pick up her trail in the
morning and was very nearly empaled
in a leopard-trap that afternoon i
received a warning from the sorcer of
the presence of a very sacred and aw-
ful spirit in the direction i had gone

   my excuse for lingering in the
neighborhood was wearing thin and
the priest was beginning to look on
me with unconcealed suspicion mean-
while there was no hint of what i
sought and the whole tribe was hum-
ming with an undercurrent of politics
that would have done credit to tam-
many hall during election

   my time had not been entirely
wasted however for i had the skin
of an albino thrush  it proved new to
science and also a large white spi-
der of the trap-door variety the first
absolute case of albinoism i had ever
found among the arachnida my camp
was ready to be abandoned and my
porters to travel and i made up my
mind to start for the coast the mo-
ment  had solved the problem of the
girls nightly trip

   the crisis came sooner than i ex-
pected in spite of the objections of
the spiritual power the chief made a
raid toward the sea and returned with
heavy spoil and ten captives there
was much rejoicing in the tribe
though the sorcer was very angry and
the captives were closely guarded and
well fed so that their ultimate grue-
some disposal was only too obvious
the war party gained in strength and
it was decided the matter of moving
the white gorilla



on to new conquests le finally decided
at the feast of the gorillas when the
moon was full

   my position was now not only
very uncomfortable but positively
dangerous and i kept exclusively to
my own camp my only connection
with the fan village being through
ikstu time hanging heavy on my
hands i hit on an expedient that i
should have thought of long before

   through a pair of powerful field-
glasses i spied the girls route each
evening until i finally traced her
down to her destination a rocky am-
phitheater hardly a mile distant from
the village

   that night darkness came so
quickly i could not see what she did
but the next evening the secret of her
expeditions and at the same time the
end of my quest were revealed to me
from the crotch of a great rubber tree
i watched her set down her basket and
swaying slightly as people do in the
cataleptic state raise her arms above
her orchid-crowned head evidently
calling

   twice she did this and then from
a cleft in the rocks an unbelievable ob-
ject swung slowly out to meet her

   never have i seen so beautiful
and so repulsive an animal it was an
enormous female gorilla with fur long
and white as that of an angora goat
even in a crouched position practi-
cally on all fours its jet-black face
was above the girl on whom it looked
down from eyes that seemed through
my field-glasses milk white

   one mighty arm rose and rested
on the girl the other groping in the
basket at her feet and thus the two
figures stood while the fruits were
crammed into an enormous mouth
then the girl lifted with both hands
the great paw from her bare shoulder
and before the quick tropical darkness
shut them from my sight i saw her
catch the wreath of purple orchids
from her own neck and throw it over
the brutes head

   at camp with his chest bleeding

from a knife wound i found lkstu
waiting for me without giving him
time to explain his own errand i told
quickly what i had seen he was in
no way astonished and i doubt even
if he heard half i said so full was he
of his own troubles

  the sorcer had somehow learned
of the meetings with his daughter and
was keeping her in a continual hyp-
notic state so that quite unconscious
of what she was doing or saying she
had actually stabbed him at their last
rendezvous and even threatened him
with  the blind eyes of piety

   his simple request was that i
should take him and the girl away with
me after he had killed the sorcer dur-
ing the coming feast i consented
without the slightest hesitation bar-
gaining only that he should tell me in
return all he knew of the white go-
rilla

    gradually though it was apparent
he feared a celestial thunderbolt i
dragged the story from him the
beast under the care of the sorcer had
been the fetish of the tribe ever since
he could remember and figured in
every religious ceremony at the be-
ginning of the fans march toward
the coast the gorilla had always gone
into battle with them and maddened
by a great beaker of the potent palm
wine proved a terror to their enemies
then to the lasting grief of the sor-
cer during a night attack it had lost
the sight of both eyes from a fire-
brand

    formerly it had been a docile and
friendly animal when not inflamed
by the palm liquor with the unre-
strained freedom of the village but
this accident changed it into a she-
devil that dwelt morosely alone and
could only be approached by the sor-
cers daughter and that only when
under her fathers hypnotic influence

    its a wild tale painter-man and
sitting here before the fire one can
hardly believe it actually happened in
the iungle though with the blackness
of the tropical night wrapped around


all-story weekly

us like velvet ribbons the squeak of
the vampire bats the far-away roar of
a male gorilla and the cough of a
leopard circling the camp it seemed
perfectly natural and fitting for me to
be conniving with a cannibal at a
cold-blooded murder

   besides i wanted the skin of that
albino primate and i was going to
have it at any cost i believed every
word of lkstus story even to divine
attributes with which he credited the
brute and of which  have not told you
-you see i had seen it and alive

  van dam snapped on the electric
lights and turned in his chair to face
the glass cabinet which contained his
latest acquisition my eyes followed
his and i shuddered to the very depths
of my city-swaddled soul the great
monkey had been mounted bending
slightly forward its hands swinging
between and far below its knees in
its immense paws it held a pear-
shaped crystal larger than an ostrichs
egg which caught and imprisoned the
light

  beautiful long silky fur white as
silver clothed the enormously power-
ful body and beneath the low fore-
head deep in the black face were set
in lieu of eyes two round milky-white
agates the mouth was curled back
in a fixed grin revealing the broken
yellow doglike fangs repulsive be-
yond belief by contrast with the beauty
and power of the rest of the animal

   go on van i said  you
couldnt make me disbelieve anything
about that thing for heavens sake
out with the lights though j dont
want to look at it

  the blood showed at the top of the
scar on van dams cheek slithered
down its ragged length and winked
out leaving it livid white he switched
 tt the electric current and we were
left again with only the light of the
fire

   i gave tkstu no advice as to his
killing van dam continued  be-
cause t felt that he was quite com-
petent to carry out his private ven-

detta in his own way however
since the next evening was to see the
beginning of the feast of the gorillas
i moved my camp a mile toward the
coast and prepared everything fur
immediate flight in the afternoon i
made ikstu guide me by a round-
about route to the very edge of the
rocky amphitheater above the beasts
den and ensconced myself within
easy hearing and seeing distance in
the thick top of a scitamines bush

   hardly was i comfortably settled
when the sorcer and his daughter
both heavily laden with baskets ap-
peared beneath me

   i dont think i have ever seen
anything more beautiful than that
girl of actual clothes she wore only
a white loin-cloth but her hair was
braided full of the purple orchids and
garland on garland of the same
flower hung from her neck and cov-
ered her lithe brown body

   the sorcer was hideously painted
in crimson and white and his face
was made up to simulate a gorilla the
hair drawn far back and two extra
white eyes daubed on the forehead

  f immediately the girl sitting with
crossed legs began to beat a tiny tom-
tom while the sorcer built a small
fire and busied himself with the
baskets and three other articles i
recognized them as a leopard skin
worn by one of the under chiefs a
mat from a hut and lkstus favorite
spear

   when the fire was going well the
girl stood up and called the third
time her voice rose the white gorilla
emerged slowly from its den and hesi-
tatingly hopped and swung down to
her then before my eyes took
place the most remarkable perform-
ance i have witnessed

   the man cast some herb into the
fire and the girl led the animal into
the thick scented smoke time and
again it broke from her and rushed to
its rocky refuge time and again it
came back to her call ilerb after
herb each with a different odor went
the white gorilla



into the flames and gradually the
movements of the great beast became
slower lethargic till it finally stood
swaying its blind agate eyes turned
to the sorcer

   once the girl faltered and seemed
to be awakening from a trance but
her father held the crystal to her eyes
till they went blank and she again
mechanically did his bidding now
he transferred the sacred stone to the
gorillas paws and began a chant
the words were not of the bantu
tongue but from some language older
than the hills i dont know what
they mean but i remember the sound
mixed with the beat of the tom-tom
as well as though i were now hear-
ing it

    nala bong nala bong

    nala impi bong bong bong

   nala bong nala bong

    nala impi bong bong bong

   nala bong nala bong

    nala impi bong bong bong

intoned to the sullen beat of the
drum till the world seemed to go to
sleep and the brain reach forward for
the next repetition

   the great brute began to move
slowly in a swaying dance keeping
time with the rhythm one by one
the girl held the leopard skin mat
and spear against its flat nostrils
while for each separate article the
sorcer pressed a hot coal to the slowly
shuffling feet at every bum the
beast reared and raising the glittering
crystal to which its paws seemed
glued dashed it down on the object
before it

    extraordinary as was the idea i
recognized at once that for the usual
passes and crystal gazing used in hyp-
notism the sorcer had first substitu-
ted the scent of herbs and then the
chant and actually held the frightful
beast in control by that thin thread of
sound

    still beating her tom-tom with
measured strokes the voice of the girl
took up the mysterious words and

the sorcer grew silent crouched over
the fire night was coming last i
slipped from my hiding place as the
forest shadows blackened the cliff and
silently slid down to the very cleft
whence had come the gorilla there i
lay in the darkness peering at the
three figures before the fire

   first one tom-tom another a
third till their number seemed count-
less awoke in the village there was
a high shrill scream of agony from
far away then the voice of the whole
tribe raised in a great chorus the
words growing distinguishable as
they grew nearer

   jn english they would go like
this

   the sun oh the sun from the rising
         of the sun

    we go through jungle aisles until
        the moon is high

  theres blood within our footsteps
        and every warrior one

    lifts up a limp dead body unto the
         bleeding skv

     always before goes the white one
         piety piety thou

    leads us in the path of the sun
         piety piety thou

    judge at the feast when the red
         blood runs free

    leading the fans to hot cruel vic-
           tory

    we come for thy judgment again
         come to thee

         piety piety thou

   meanwhile under the roar of
voices the girl sang her monotonous
strain and beat her tiny drum

   the whole tribe defiled into the
amphitheater chiefs first with the
leopard skins which they alone are
privileged to wear-a custom that
links them with the zulus-then the
warriors with the prisoners in their
midst now significantly reduced to
nine and last the women and chil-
dren

  these bore fagots which they piled
in the center and a large lire was soon
blazing the ceremonies began to
the music of the inevitable tom-toms
with a furious dance by the warriors


all-story weekly

   t was a wild scene the nearly

naked savages brandishing their
spears and whirling around the fire
the prisoners conscious of the hor-
rible fate awaiting them cowering in
the background the crouching
figures of the great white gorilla the
hideously painted sorcer and the ex-
quisite brown girl intoning her end-
less chant

   as a proper stage setting the
heavens began to grumble lightning
hashed across the sky and a few big
hot drops of rain fell

   the dance and the tom-toms
ceased with such startling suddenness
that the voice of the girl cut sharp as
a knife through the murmur of the
multitude the priest faced the great
white brute and spoke

    piety against whom the ogowe
fans have sinned before we ask thy
judgment for the tribe select from us
in expiation let the sacred crystal
gleam red in thy honor

   he raised a close-woven basket
full of palm wine to its nostrils and
while it still held the crystal pendant
in its paws tipped it till it was
drained of the last drop for a mo-
ment the white gorilla staggered then
hopping forward balanced at its full
height before the chief while the
girls song and the beat of the tiny
drum alone broke the silence it circled
to the right bent with distended nos-
trils above the chief whose leopard
skin was in the sorcers possession
and quicker than i can tell it the
great paws rose and the crystal came
crashing down on the doomed mans
skull resolved to end the scene then
and there cost what it might i raised
my rifle to my shoulder and then low-
ered it again at what i saw

   sinuous as a snake stealthy as a
leopard ikstu a knife in his hand
was creeping up behind the sorcer
 arned by some subtle instinct the
priest turned barely before the spring
one hand shot out the finger point-
ing straight at the boy and their eyes
locked with nearly an audible snap

it seemed as though invisible bonds
held the would-be murderer he
struggled in vain to raise the knife
to go forward

   the pointed finger described a
slow circle ikstus head followed it
faster it swung and faster with a
great burst of strength the sorcer
snatched the sacred crystal from be-
tween the gorilla paws and held it
to the boys face for a breath ikstu
swayed away from the glittering
lights then his head went forward
and eyes glued to the shining thing
he sank with it to the ground

   the sorcer silently faced the
breathless multitude then deliberately
picked up ikstus own spear and
turned toward him there was a
great crash of thunder and the go-
rilla still swaying to the girls music
groped blindly forward the priest
raised the spear the girl broke off
in the middle of a note and quicker
than light covered her lovers body
with her own

   released from the spell of the
chant though suddenly animate the
white gorilla tore the priest into his
terrible arms and bore him to the
ground a blinding flash of lightning
split the heavens as i fired catch-
ing the outline of the gorilla i pulled
the trigger again and sprang down
into the arena every savage had
fled save the chief who stood spear
poised between the lovers and the
struggling man and brute with a
back-hand sweep of his long arm the
gorilla ripped open my cheek at the
very moment  sent a final bullet
through its forehead

   the sorcer was quite dead prac-
tically every bone in his body broken
by the awful clutch of those hairy
arms the white gorilla still feebly
moved through the mushroom bullet
had carried away practically the en-
tire back of its head the girl the
chief and i alone were alive and
sane and until morning in the hot
rain we labored to strip the skin from
that great carcass
the white gorilla



   then the girl leading ikstu by
the hand and the skin swinging be-
tween us on a pole we struck out for
my camp the chief in silence
watched his son depart and did not
try to hinder us

   perhaps he was thinking of the
fate of those among the fans who
were found mentally wanting and in
addition there was the sacrilege of
the attack on the priest

  van dam lay back in his chair and
carefully lit a cigarette

  that isnt all i asked after a
moments silence

   thats all he answered

   but whats the end of it  what
became of the girl and ikstu

   the girl died on the way out
ikstu lies there before the fire his
mind never came back to him i have
hopes however he has taken to wor-
shiping the beast in the case and bow-
ing down to the crystal interest in
anything is an encouraging sign

   you have a pleasant way of en-
tertaining your guests i said for
want of something better  canni-
balism murder madness everything
but starvation

   we had about come to that too
van answered carelessly  on the
way back when we ran into a great
migration of spider monkeys they
make very good eating we just had
one for dinner

moon-madness

 by dorothy foster

           if a girl i know

           would watch the moon

  and see the things i see

            a twinkle
            in the crinkle

            of his smile might speak for me

            and the shrewdly winking

             blandly blinking

  wise old nice old moon

           might beam her

           words a dreamer

             sang to an old familiar tune

            but if she knew
            the things  do

             i think perhaps shed find
             a token

            left unspoken

             in the sighing of the wind

              and the dear old flirting
              disconcerting
              moon that hangs so high

             might lisp her

 captains of the rainbow
by c williams wood is a sea story with
the real salt tang when the captains
three to wit captain henry ivagg cap-
tain william slubber and captain john
swiggles-all of whom had sailed the
seven seas  when a yankee clipper was a
prouder ship than a turbined liner is to-
day -start to run guns and other con-
traband into mexico they are sure some
little filibusters

  but there are some things even the most
seasoned old salt cannot be expected to an-
ticipate fog is one of them and the idi-
osyncrasies of a squarehead skipper of a
rusty old swede tramp is another and the
all-seeing impertinently inquisitive  eye 
is the third and worst

  even so the story might have had a dif-
ferent ending if it hadnt been for the per-
versity of inanimate things-anchors to
be exact-which maliciously - well did
things they shouldnt sounds interesting

doesn t it it is and it carries a full cargo
of hearty laughs as well

  the ten-dollar gold piece
by isabel ostrander contains a very queer
bit of psychology grant ridgezcay was
one of the supreme powers in the financial
world of two continents he was worth
more thousands than the average man has
cents and never from his entrance into
the financial field had he neglected to at-
tend a directors meeting

  that was the one rule of his life-every-
thing must give way before it yet the
real secret compelling reason for grant
ridgeivays attendance at directors meet-
ings was simply - that he wanted the
bright new ten-dollar gold piece that would
come to him as a reward for his punctu-
ality 

  can you think of anything stranger-or
more reasonable and grant ridgeways
curious obsession led to some cataclysmic
changes in a number of lives as you will
find

  the mysterious fisherman
by edwin cole is a good example of the
ancient saying you never can tell

  edith osborn thought he was a colossus
of a man as she watched him with his
trousers rolled to his knees and the sleeves
of his flannel shirt to his elbows pulling a
boat up on the beach but mitchell who
was with her sneered

  he is making his brawn do the work
of his brain was his comment

  the girl said nothing but did not agree
yet she could not have known how soon
and under what circumstances they were
to meet the fisherman again

from buck thorntons pal

to the editor

  i have been a constant reader of the
cavalier for some time your staff of au-
thors is o k in every respect of course
i like some of your stories much better
than others

  now for instance buck thornton was
all right and jackson gregory at some
time in his life must have lived in the
west i have known several men in my
time that were similar to buck thornton
only no one ever discovered them

  and george washington ogden did a
good job when he wrote  the bondboy
however i hardly think that joe was jus-
tified in committing perjury in such a cause
anyway it was a mighty interesting story
and another one along the same line would
not come amiss

  the fur bringers  was a very good
story of the far north and hulbert foot-
ner would do well to try again others

probably like some of the other stories bet-
ter than the ones that i have mentioned
as it takes all kinds to please the public
as for me i would like to have jackson
gregory find another buck thornton as
there are many out in this part of the
country

  i have been a reader of your magazine
for some years but  can t see where fred
lackson gets bis stuff it is all right for
ten twenty and thirty melodrama but in
written form it is rotten

  i think j u giesy and j b smith arc-
two of the best writers you have i also
like octavus roy cohens stories

  i dont believe your heart to heart
talks are genuine and bet five dollars with
a cavalier reader that you would not print

the sealed valley i am reading for
the first time from maurice drake in

to the editor 

i have noticed in the heart to heart
talks that many readers write you their
opinion with regard to this magazine and
so trust that my letter will not be consid-
ered an intrusion

about the first all-story t purchased
was the november  number since
then i have been a constant reader nearly
six years

   it would be wrong for me to say that
every story suits me although a very large
majority have my vote

the stories of adventure and mystery
are good and as i think back for western
fiction  the lone star ranger  and  to
the victor come to my mind as about the
best yet while  doc which ends in this
weeks number is not to be placed behind
but alongside the two first named how-
ever if a leader must be picked let it be
 the lone star ranger

   hoping the good work may continue

to five jitneys i will continue to have it
every week

   keep up your good work i am always

hard to beat this record

to the editor

  just finished reading the issue of may
 of the all-story cavalier and was very
much disappointed in you for announcing
the proposed abolition of the word  cava-
lier from the title of this the best of the
all-fiction magazines

  i take about fifteen different publica-
tions every month but prefer the com-
bined-title magazine to all the rest not
only because i can get it every week but
because it contains in my opinion just the
right proportion of comedy tragedy and
pathos to appeal to almost any reader

  i will not sajr i prefer any one two or
three authors more than i do others be-
cause if i do not like the title of a story i
do not read it this does not mean that
the story is no good because other mem-
bers of my family probably do like it and
i have quite a large family consisting as
it does of ten people eight of whom are
weekly readers of the cavalier

  i really do not wish to bore you mr
editor as i know you surely are a very
busy man however i was reading in the
heart to heart talks some time ago of
some people who claim that they arc the
oldest readers of this magazine unless
i am wholly wrong in my contention i am
about as old a reader not subscriber as
the magazine has i thought i would
write and ask if the following is or is not
correct

  ts not the present day au-story cava-
lier the lineal descendent of the ocean
magazine and is not the following the di-
rect line of magazines from that old-timer

  first the ocean then the live wire
third the scrap book then you brought
out the cavalier which was eventually
combined with the scrap book under the
title cavalicr-scrap book then the word
scrap-book was dropped from the title

chapter xxxvii
the first thunder-clap

tt happened that at that time
as afterward england and

portugal had a working
agreement as to the man-
agement of certain affairs
connected with their neigh-
boring colonies in africa

tn many respects their interests
were mutual and inseparable such for

example as in the good conduct of
the native hordes the suppression of
piracy the maintenance of the status
quo

  on the day that abu made that
great speech of his h m cruiser
vanity came floating tranquilly into
the harbor of zanzibar and no sooner
was her anchor down than captain
berwind was over her side and off in
a sparkling launch to call on his old
friend the agent

thi lory began in the all-story cavalier weekly for may 


abu the dawn-maker



  the agency was one of the pleas-
antest places on the coast-large
light and airy in the midst of a
charming garden verandas that were
alike famous for their view and their
hospitality

  and captain berwind sighed as he
bade his host good-by with a hearty
handclasp and a slap on the shoulder

   it makes me quite ill to leave you
so soon said the captain who was
the picture of pink health and jollity
as he said it but really we shall
have to look in on the beggars back
again in a fortnight you know

  the agent smiled

   i fancy its nothing serious
deuced pity you have to toddle off like
this

  the sparkling launch once more
trailed her wake across the harbor
in a little while there came the silver
trill of a bosns pipe and up from
the mud and water came the vanitys
anchor

  it was a beautiful day calm and
transparently clear

  while the mosques and towers and
the long white walls of the town were
still as distinct and colorful as a pic-
ture by gerorne there lifted above the
horizon the dim contour of the main-
land almost thirty miles away

   they say the fellow sir is some-
thing of a religious fanatic lieu-
tenant gordon remarked to his chief

   religion and murder usually go
hand-in-hand in these latitudes said
the captain

   as in dear old glasgow sir some
time back

   you may have a chance to lead a
shore-party the captain remarked

   oh sir i shall be the proudest
man in the fleet 

   tut tut said the captain be-
nignantly  therell be little enough
glory a few niggers more or a few
niggers less 

  the vanity steered south not going
very fast burning no more coal than
she had to there was no occasion
for reckless haste-not so far as any-

one knew she would take her time
give a look round on the way

  besides there was the time of the
day she would prefer to pay her re-
spects  to zemballa that being the
more important of the two towns that
she had in mind

  she was keeping well out but along
toward sundown she managed to pick
up a dhow with a villainous-looking
crew aboard under the captaincy of
one msenna who was as much a fol-
lower of the prophet as he was a fol-
lower of anything-excepting the
shore for to hug the coast was his
only science of navigation

  captain berwind invited msenna
into his cabin and msenna came
where they discussed the weather and
the local gossip with the greatest pos-
sible cordialty

  it was a pleasant place in spite of
the breeches of a couple of big guns
that obtruded their presence on the un-
initiated visitor there was an elec-
tric fan a fernery a couple of ger-
aniums that had come out from eng-
land a lively canary in a cage a table
with a red cloth

   it is even as i tell you said
msenna with his eyes now on a lit-
tle stack of sovereigns which lay to
the left on the captains table and
again on the service-revolver which
lay to his right  sultan sayd bin
sayf was killed four days ago and
now his throne in the palace is oc-
cupied by sultan sefu surnamed the
giver of gifts surnamed the peoples
friend surnamed the dawn-makers
elder son he is- 

  where is this dawn-maker
now asked the captain

   lo they say he is ascended in a
cloud even as- 

  the captain scowled at his revolver
looked msenna over

  where is the dawn-maker now 
 lo even as i said and he has
come to earth again at the hill called
the maniangno

  the captain started the place was
indicated on all marine-charts as one


all-story weekly

of the ancient coast-marks of import-
ance

   msenna he said  i hate to do
it hut i am going to give you and
your men a free ride and your boat

a tow

  msenna began a protest

   you had no papers i suspect you
of piracy snapped the captain if

i	find that i am mistaken and a
mighty short time will permit me to
find out ill pay you this gold

  the captain raised his hand an inch
or two and the marines who had been
msennas honorary escort hustled
him to the upper deck where the ven-
tilation was better

  the vanity belying her name had
the ragged dhow in tow as she circled
out and up the coast in the direction
of zena and while she was still a
good eight miles off her destination
another dhow was reported dipping
to the breeze doing her best ap-
parently to head the cruiser off

  ten minutes later the officer of the
deck reported that the dhow had run
up the portuguese flag that there was
a man who appeared to be a portu-
guese officer aboard

  in another ten minutes the captain
of the vanity was receiving the second
visitor in his cabin-a small man
wiry efficient

   braga 

   berwind 

   youll excuse me said the por-
tuguese captain with a laugh  for
appearing without shirt and collar
with slippers instead of shoes-

  he had pulled on a suit of linen-
jacket and trousers-and nothing
else except the moorish slippers he
wore

   -but you see i was an arab
when i left the shore i left my rags
in the dhow and you can thank god
for that berwind

  they looked at each other with
smiling seriousness

  the flag-officer who had accom-
panied braga to captain berwinds
quarters saluted and withdrew

   you have arrived just in time
said captain braga when they were
alone  i knew you would oh you
british the thing was getting ser-
ious 

   i smelled it at zanzibar said ber-
wind  i didnt like the way the fel-
lows in the dhows looked up at me
the way the niggers on the water-front
strutted and bunched together

   theyre all in it said braga
 swahili and kafirs amatonga
mombasah bushmen from the back-
country-all 

   by the lord harry 

   you know about zemballa no
regrets sayd bin sayf is well out of
the way this fellow sefu who ac-
cording to my secret agents has taken
sayds place appears to be not a bad
sort- peoples friend-easy to man-
age if we show him that we are the
peoples hope it is like that with
saadi now on the top of the heap at
zena- 

  so they hold zena too

   theyve done me that favor said
braga  theyve performed a real
service-cleaned out al-marwazi and
his friends-you know those fellows
who have been plotting another arab
conquest saadi will make the best
of allies for us if we treat him right
but- 

   but this chap they call the day-
breaker or the dawn-maker or- 
 him said braga slowly  we
shall have to get 

  another mad mullah

   another mohammed 

   no 

   precisely berwind you and i
have grown gray in this part of the
world havent we weve seen some
pretty ticklish situations bv and large
havent we well my friend this is
nnc of them-the beginning of one of
them at any rate they had a chauri
on the mamangno to-day theyve
decided that their next step will be the
capture of-zanzibar

 my word

   they say the natives there nig-
abu the dawn-maker



ger and arab afloat and ashore are
ready for the word and you know
 if you play the flute in zanzibar - 
 whats he like this prophet-a
swash-buckler a blood-drinker 

  	worse the swines a poet 
curse it ill get the beggar and
take that out of him

   the sooner the better for all of
us ive made my arrangements
over in zemballa i can have sefu
seized at any time i can also have
a certain mullah who has been help-
ing him knifed by an enthusiast
that done all that remains is diplo-
macy

   here in zena my men and the
arabs of the back country who are
ready can clean up the town the mo-
ment that this d-d dawn-maker is
out of the wtay and-sure-not-to
-come back

   he wont come back

   i suggest that we get him to-mor-
row at daybreak hell be on his hill
we can pen him up for the night im
afraid therell be a hot ten minutes or
so he wont surrender hes not
that kind

  the captain rubbed his nose he
touched a bell

   a nip before dinner braga no
it will scarcely be worth while to ask
him to surrender-not until- 

  in the meantime the vanity was
pawing the smooth green water like
an impatient horse on the turf her
smoke curled upward then slanted
toward the shore in response to the
variable breeze

  she was barely moving but getting
closer and closer to the coast

  the shore from where she lay was
a picture of perfect peace-a flaming
sky over a tropic waterfront jungle-
covered except where zena lay a
streak of saffron and pinkish white
a little to the north flat except where
the headland called the mamangno
thrust out its dark-green cliff almost
to the waters edge a little further
south

lieutenant gordon on the bridge

studied the scene passionately through
his binoculars the light was bad
with the shore in the shadow and the
sea as brilliant as the sky but he saw
enough to keep him interested

   there appear to be enough of the
rascals scampering about he said
 more than enough for any good

   therell perhaps be fewer of them
when the old man gets through with
them said lieutenant smith his par-
ticular friend who was there at his
side  why what- 

  from the black top of the ma-
mangno there had come a spark of
light in the deepening twilight a puff
of smoke then long afterward the
thud of a cannon

   a salute said smith

   no said gordon  by the great
horn spoon itsa challenge

  a spurt of water marked where a
shot had struck the oily rocking sur-
face of the sea

     chapter xxxviii
     night before the dawn

there was a tremor of panic
among most of the natives as-
sembled on the mamangno and
around it

  a good many of them had never
seen a warship before but they had
all heard about such a thing it had
always been one of the chief instru-
ments of the white mans magic

  there was a tradition concerning it
that was more potent even than the
tradition of the dawn-maker

  abu sought to alia this panic he
was all the more keen in lifs efforts
to do so because he recognized that
there was a trace of it perhaps in his
own heart

  not that he was afraid he had
passed beyond fear of any kind long
ago he was a man who had cast off
definitely all claim to life and to those
things that render life dear

  it was ne who ordered the cannon
jired although he was not fool enough


all-story weekly

to imagine that it could have any pos-
sible effect on that great steel mystery
floating out there in the offing it was
the effect on his followers that he was
after for he glimpsed the great trag-
edy that was already drawing near

  he called his counselors about him
talked to them about the reconstitu-
tion of the old zenj empire to the
north of chakas old empire to the
south

  lie commanded the drummer to
send out the call for all the fighting
men of all the tribes of africa and
this time the sound of the drum
tumbled and rolled like thunder-
something wholly different from the
calls that had gone out to the wise
men

  it was to such an accompaniment
as this that he talked of achieving em-
pire through sacrifice-ten thousand
or a hundred thousand dawn-mak-
ers not one and each of them like
him the bridegroom of a new day

  but in the midst of all this there
came a new excitement it was panic
mixed with exaltation this time

  around a point of land to the south
there had suddenly appeared a dhow
with the flag of the dawn-maker
flapping at the masthead

  there was scarcely any breeze but
the crew of the dhow evidently num-
erous had the sweeps out and were
rowing

  the first dhow was followed by an-
other then another and another until
there was a full score of them it
was the fleet of abdallah

  the sails were red and yellow or
striped blue and dirty white the
hulls were crowded

  while these were fanning out and
away from the shore evidently in
keeping with some prearranged plan
there appeared from the same quar-
ter a small iron steamship that had
long been familiar to every native liv-
ing on the shore

  it was the portuguese gunboat di-
ogo cam

  she was shaggy from neglect she

was belching blue wood-smoke but
she also floated the flag of the double

eye

and a good deal as a terrier would
bolt for a bull she headed straight

for the cruiser

  all this in the flare and shimmer
of the setting sun with the indian
ocean rocking lazily with stupendous
africa looking on

  it was the cruiser that spoke first
there was a puff of smoke followed
by an inadequate but spiteful bark it
was a blank cartridge more likely
than not

  the diogo cam kept her course
she seemed to le picking up a little
speed although her progress seemed
slow enough to those who watched her
from the shore

  there ruffled up the first breath of
a breeze that sent her flag to writh-
ing and which was seized upon im-
mediately moreover by the quick sail-
ors in the dhows

  one or two of them the first to
catch the breeze heeled over and
raced in the direction of the cruiser
like gulls intent on a feed

  the cruiser barked again and this
time there was a jump of white water
near the diogo cams stem at the
same time a little trail of signal-flags
shook out over the cruiser as foolish-
looking as a line of washing

  but to neither of these things did
the diogo cam pay any more atten-
tion than she had paid to that pre-
vious shot she kept right on

  then suddenly the diogo cam
herself boomed out a challenge she
had two small cannon mounted in bar-
bettes to port and starboard and a
quick-fire mounted on her bridge

  she must have fired all of these
simultaneously only the quick-fire
was still rippling out its blasphemies
after the cannon had already coughed
their say

  at the same time there was desul-
tory firing from several of the dhows

  this much happened in one of those
breathless eternal seconds which are
abu the dawn-maker



long enough for the destruction or the
creation of a universe then the
cruiser fired twice and it was seen
that something had happened to the
diogo cam and likewise to one of the
dhows

  the gunboat had grown smaller by
her top-hamper her bridge and her
smoke-stack had jumped below as if
they had been pulled by strings

  the stricken dhow was fluttering
over on its side like a winged bird
and some of her people were over-
board

  another one of those surcharged
seconds shattered by a double puff
and a double snapping bark from the
cruiser and the diogo cam answered
instantly with a puff of steam a faint
rumbling roar

  she pawed the air for a second or
two she disappeared

  all this on the rocking ocean in
the last red flare of the sunset in the
midst of a sort of magnificent cyn-
icism in which even the cruiser shared
-as if the cruiser were a part of that
superworld which has no regard what-
soever for the affairs of men

  and then panic had broken out
again on the mamangno and in the
vicinity of it and there was a swirl-
ing movement of the people in the
first distracted aimless rush of an in-
cipient stampede

  as if it had seen enough the sun
plopped down and it was almost in-
stantly night-just enough light left
out at sea to show how other dhows
were being crippled by the leisurely
occasional sniff of the great steel beast
out there

  brothers brothers cried abu

  but he could scarcely make his
voice heard his heart was filled with
anguish at the thought that thus ab-
dallah had sacrificed himself in some
wild hope that he would be protected
by the double eye and the parallel
thought that all these men who had as-
sembled here to do him honor to share
his dream of the dawn might sim-
ilarly be annihilated

  he had been looking forward to
some sort of a miracle and this was
the answer to it

   brothers brothers he shouted
nevertheless  nothing can happen to
you-nothing but death and what
is death if we die for the dawn 

  darkness closed in sudden and
tight almost like an act of imprison-
ment but some one fired the pile of
brushwood that had been prepared in
front of his tent and the flames roared
up showing the throne-chair there and
the piled-up treasure on the elephant-
skin

  abu rushed into the tent in search
of rennyvo in search of kula the
lamps were lighted but the place was
deserted 

  a moment and he was listening to
the huge sough of a rising storm re-
moter and greater than the shouting
and movement of the camp outside
the tent before he could make a
move to learn the meaning of this
new tumult kula and several other
of the witch-doctors burst in upon
him

  it was kula who spoke even as he
came slanting forward and knelt in
front of him

   something has happened at zena
also cried kula  they are storm-
ing here in this direction we are
afraid that they mean no good save
yourself 

  save myself abu exclaimed
tensely he laughed  save my-
self when im meant to save the
world  

  kula looked up at him with the
mute appeal of a tame animal the
other witch-doctors cried out to abu
and among themselves that there was
a time to fight and a time to flee

  abu cursed

   wheres rennyvo  where is ma-
tanda oh by allah ill go alone-

   come away with us to the sa-
cred grove cried kula

    have you still faith in the sacred
grove 

   yes the world changes and the


all-story weekly

men in it but the sacred grove never

changes 

   then hurry to it-you and all the
old men abu answered  pray to
your gods and pray to mecca and
pray to the father of all gods black
and white but we younger men shall
stay here to fight the white men can
beat us on the ocean but on the land
were equal we re- 

  what he was saying was inter-
rupted by a fusillade at the foot of the
mamangno a surge of cheering and
shrieks

  just outside the tent in the midst of
the general clamor there abu heard a
voice he recognized he started to
spring forward but before he could
lake a step matanda staggered in-
gasping naked wounded

   bwatia  he cried

  abu caught him lowered him to the
carpet

   the arabs-they have taken zena
by surprise-an army of them gath-
ered from the hills-aided by the por-
tuguese-who have left their fort- 
 kula quick matanda is wound-
ed cried abu apparently indifferent
to anything else  linen-water-
brown powder- 

  matanda smiled up at abu

   dawn-maker dawn-maker 
the smile remained as his life slip-
ped out

  the old men lifted matanda and
started off with him across the tent
but it was doubtful where they hoped
to carry him the human storm
which at its height is always more
terrible than thunder and lightning
can ever be was growing momentarily
more violent more pressing

  there were shots at the very door
of the tent the voice of rennyvo in
command a howl of savage laughter

  it was a strange contrast-first that
roup of old men carrying off the
body of matanda staggering a little
under the weight then that other
group that staggered in under ren-
nyvos command for they were young
and excited and they were tugging at

the elephant-hide with its piled-up

treasure

chapter xxxix
while hope flickered

iq the mob from zena cried
  rennyvo  came like a pack of
famished hyenas traitors had
spread word that the treasure was
here for the taking they-

   the arabs  abu asked

   it was the opportunity the arabs
and the portuguese were waiting for
saadi has been seized and taken to the
fort the portuguese control the
town the arabs ate -scattering
through the brush i came to save
this

  he indicated the treasure

 i came to save you i shall cut a
path for you get you to a place of

safety

  i flee  cried abu fiercely i
am in the arms of my mother here
i remain 

   you could return here later

   i could rennyvo i abu the
dawn-maker could never return v
spoken like a kingm cried ren-
nyvo  spoken like a hova 

he knelt and kissed abus hand
but the immediate danger was evi-
dently not from either arabs or por-
tuguese but from the mob that had
come out from zena

  there was a swirl of cries and fight-
ing at the door of the tent and the
first of the mob appeared overwhelm-
ing the warriors whom rennyvo had
left on guard while he tried to make
the treasure safe

  they fought their way in with
famished cries eager indifferent to
blows their eyes their faces their
every movement indicating that they
were tihe human wolf-pack that has
scented loot

  they were worse than they had been
that night at al-marwazis house
worse even than they had been after-
ward at zena for now they had tasted
abu the dawn-maker



the sort of blood the wanted had be-
come insatiable

  a dozen men fell as they scrambled
at the glittering horde on the elephant
hide

  rennyvo shrieked something that
was both order and curse and sprang
forward he was unarmed he
kicked and struck it was as though
he kicked and struck a waterfall

  abu seized the copper incense-urn
he swung it up he advanced with it
poised

  not samson with his jaw-bone of
an ass could have slain more philis-
tines than abu could have slain with
a club like that

  but he stayed his hand

  a hollow-eyed beach-comber whom
he recognized and who must have
been cheated out of the good things of
zena for he was still gaunt and still
in rags was sprawled there just in
front of him and had turned and
looked up at him as he clutched at gold
and gems

  the mob was like a swarm of rats
in a granary

  abu staggered back cast his weapon
from him he caught the furious
rennyvo by the arm and drew him
away

   let them do as they wish he said
 call off your men

  but even tlhose warriors of ren-
nyvos wer not exempt from the same
passion that consumed the mob they
had guessed the order before it reached
them were themselves dipping into
the treasure

  in its scrambling haste the mob was
making poor progress many of the
men who composed it were almost
naked or at best clad in mere rags
they tried to gather the treasure into
their arms it slipped from their
grasp

  they tried again

  sometimes one would get as far as
the opening in the rear of the tent
would be jostled or toppled over
would have to begin all over again

  but a huge kafir made a sack of

his loin-cloth and scraped it full
started to stagger away into the con-
cealing night

   others were wildly following his ex-
ample-mauling grabbing scratching
disappearing with all they could carry
the treasure melted fast soon there
were those who crawled about on
hands and knees in the dim light
shrieking with joy over a single nug-
get a single gem a single minted coin

  kula was there again telling abu
that he had had a sign and that he
was going out to meet his own death
in a fitting way-a way that would do
good perhaps for the cause there
was a sacred serpent he knew about
on the flanks of the mamangno itself

   you are the dawn-maker the son
of the world said kula  there re-
mains to me a little fire a little strength
i place it o abu on your altar with
the sacred serpent as my priest
dont do it said abu dont
whats the use its in vain

    no act like that or yours is ever
in vain o abu farewell 

  live while i live o kula we
were slaves together you were a
father to me leave me not dont
you remember when i was little and
razi had beaten me and i had crawled
into the stables to weep alone and you
came to me- 

   that night i read your destiny on
your brow the time has come- 

   and then when i lay fettered it
was you who went to al-marwazi on
your knees to beg- 

   son son there is another master

-the compassionate-one i need

not fear kula glanced about him
looked back at abu nor you he
said  we both belong to him
kula put a hand to his ear he
seemed to listen

   the red night he whispered
 the angel calls i go 

  like a shadow he went but like a
shadow that had left something of it-
self on abus spirit he dropped his
head in his hands there were still
a few naked mongrels pawing about

but they did not notice him nor did
he notice them

  in a moment in a breath the whole
fabric of his empire had come tum-
bling down a giant hand had reached
out and shaken him from his dream
he was engulfed in an atmosphere of
nightmare

  a little while ago he had debated
the conquest of the earth he had
looked out upon a world that was new
now it was all as it had been he
had no power except the power of his
body his brain and his spirit panic
had swept his people away

  old greeds old lusts old fears had
them in their grip again-the real mas-
ters of the world

  and the world had changed for him
as well he knew it deception fell
away from him clear sight came to
him now with the roar of battle and
confusion all about him-came to him
as it hd come often before in theold
slave days when the elements of his
life and circumstances fused like the
metals in a crucible into a single flash
of blinding truth

  he had seen the faith and courage
of abdallah snuffed out like the light
of a candle by a breach out of the in-
finite

  snuffed out also was the flame that
had blinded him for these past few
days-his dream of empire his dream
of world-deliverance he had felt it
when panic first fell upon the people
who had assembled about him-that
they were on a foolish quest

  that the great world would roll on
in its appointed way he saw clearly
now whatever the aspirations and
prayers of men but to compensate
this void that overwhelmed him there
rushed in the thought of khadija-
her love for him his renunciation his
desire for her

  this desire had become the one tre-
mendous fact of the universe he
laughed he shuddered and he had
sent her away from him

  all this in a small group of seconds
-such seconds as a man might live

when he is being hanged or going

over the brink of eternity in any other
way it sent him rushing into her
part of the tent

  the place was still instinct with her
presence xo bloodhound could have
been more sensitive to the atmosphere
that still lingered there despite all those
who had passed since she had gone

  he caught up a cushion she had
used he smelled it while his breast
heaved

   khadija he whispered

  his brooding was ended by a fresh
outburst of heavy firing from the di-
rection of the shore

  it aroused him to energy

  he sprang up looked about him
saw what he wanted in the hippopo-
tamus-hide whip that hung against the
wall of the tent it brought a smile
to his lips even now to recall that kha-
dija had filched it from him for the
sake of some girlish whim

  he seized it vung it in the air

  the remaining grubbers about the
elephant-hide squealed and chattered
and scrambled out into the night

  he tore away the linen tunic until
this arms and breast were bare and his
movements unhampered the medal-
lion of the double-eye was still hang-
ing there he pressed it to his lips
lifted it above hrs head looked up at it

   you eye of omnipotence eye
that looked brightly forth at the dawn
of creation he said  look into the
night and tell me-where is-kha-

chapter xl
what the double-eye saw

as abu came out of his tent armed
with his whip and the strength
of almost superhuman exalta-
tion he paused for a moment or two
to look around him

  the wide lire still blazed sending
its quavering red light to the jungle all
around and up among the huge far-
reaching branches of the calabash tree
abu the dawn-maker

making a small red light like the one
to which kula had referred in the
midst of the greater night-the night
of stars and eternity

  he saw a slinking crowd of people
-who they were he could not tell-
off to one side and lie started toward
them but they fled from him al-
though he shouted after them

   ye are free what do ye fear 

  he turned

  the camp was deserted although
there were sounds of war in several
directions now vague and small now
clear and complex

  yet strangely enough these did not
interest ihim immediately so much as
did the sight of the animals that had
been left there the cattle and the wild
beasts that had been brought to him
that morning as gifts

  he was touched whether by the
irony of it which was enough to make
him pity himself or by pity for the
beasts he could not have told

  he noticed the young elephant
tethered by its leg to a tree and per-
iodically making mighty efforts to tear
itself free the lion which had looked
into his eyes that morning from its
wooden cage and which was clawing
and biting now at its bars with the
pitiful patience of all dumb creatures

  for the time being abu forgot
everything else then he laughed not
mirthfully

   am i not the liberator  he cried
softly

  he ran toward the elephant it
swung at him with its trunk but abu
showed no fear he spoke aloud

   behold even as i freed myself 

  the thongs that bound the elephants
leg were held by a toggle abu
knocked this free and the elephant
slowly lifted its foot from the loop it
essayed a step it swung its huge bulk
forward at a trot

  before it had plunged into the jun-
gle abu was already working loose
the pegs that held the bars of the lions
cage in place the lion sparred at
him kept up a purring growl abu

scarcely noticed he jerked loose two
of the bars at once

  there was a yellow flash and the
lion was crouched on the earth in front
of him

  it looked up at him complaining
lifted an armed paw

   fly to your mate and let naught
hinder you said abu as he swung
his whip

  the lion was gone

  he freed the tame leopard with the
collar about its neck he liberated a
cage of apes he addressed the fright-
ened cattle telling them to remain near
the fire until their enemies were safe
away

  then he thought again of the quest
that had brought him out and he
plunged into the nearest path that led
down the mamangnos side

  he came plunging into a horde of
struggling men and he could not tell
whether they were enemies or friends
but he struck about him with his whip
and shouted that peace had come and
that there should be no more fighting

  he was in a din of shouting some
of which he understood

    it is a genie 

   it is the sasabonsitm  

   in the midst of the tumult he struck
something with his foot he reached
down and found a cloth twisted around
a jangling weight and he knew that
he had recovered a portion of the
wealth that had been taken from the
tent without thought he clung to it
he still had it when lie emerged on
the beach

   the night was starlit

  the breath that came into him from
the blue-black sea brought with it a
surge of feeling that was almost joy

   far out he saw the lights of a ship
and knew instinctively that this was
the warship that had been there earlier
in the night-quiet now as if in wait-
ing-for what

   i have a greater power than
yours he said addressing it  have
you a heart have you a soul have
you a hope

   he might have said more but he
saw emerging from the nearer dark-
ness die ghostly shape of one of the
arab dhows at the same moment he
caught the thud of hoofs and by some
peculiarity he had noticed subcon-
sciously on the ride from zemballa he
knew that it was the horse that ren-
nyvo had ridden then

   rennyvo he intercepted hailed and
the hova slipped from his horse and
embraced him

    the road to zemballa he panted
 is cut at the marsh held by a force
from the warship zemballa is be-
trayed setu a prisoner o dawn-
maker you are still my master but let
me command our dream is ended
flee with me to madagascar 

   there was a splash and they both
turned to look in the direction of the
dhow some one had jumped over-
board

   rennyvo leaped forward before abu
could detain him drew a revolver
cried a challenge

    i seek the dawn-maker cried the
man in the water  i come from my
lord abdallah

   he floundered ashore rennyvo giv-
ing him a helping hand

    what is the word from my abdal-
lah asked abu

   the man peered at him through the
darkness would have fallen on his
face but rennyvo and abu both held
him up

  you are the dawn-maker
  yes and abdallah

    we were up the coast above zena
when we heard the news and as fast
as the breeze would bring us we hast-
ened to your aid the wind died out
abdallah towed us with his ship of
iron afterward we rowed his only
thought was to keep the enemys war-
ship from attacking you-his only
thought has been of you-and now to
think-

   quick my abdallah cried abu
 we picked him up from the water
after his ship was blown to pieces-
 was he hurt  

   he was dying-he is dead

   o abdallah  

   ji is last words were of you he
charged me to come and save you
when  promised he said that he died
happy for he knew you would forgive
him fmd some one to take his place

   sweet abdallah youll be my
captain when i cruise the stars ren-
nyvo you and this brave comrade sail
away while yet theres time here-
oh here--is enough o enrich both him
and you- 

  hg thrust the cloth with the treasure
in it into rennyvos hand but both the
hova and the man of the sea cried out
that they would never leave him

   i command you  said abu am
i not the dawn-maker my escape is
planned i prepare a mystery go
go with my blessing 

  they will kill vou said the sailor

   i shall live

  you will appear again cried
rennyvo wonderingly

   yea each time you dream

  abu laughed then he kissed each
of these two murderous devoted ideal-
ists on the forehead thrust them
toward the water sprang toward ren-
nyvos horse and in a moment was on
its back

  the horse plunged into the darkness
of the beach in the direction of zena

  they passed several figures who
fired after them

  two hundred yards past the last
slope of the mamangno they charged
into a sudden sheet of flame and it
was as if the horse had taken wings
it was leaping so high and far

  but abu understood and was ready
when it fell

  dismounting he charged into the
company that had lired slashing with
his whip fighting as he had fought
that other night when he freed himself
forever-as much as any man can be
free before the enemy could recover
themselves from his onslaught almost
before they had realized what had hap-
pened he was well off into the dark-
ness along the beach again
abu the dawn-maker



  he paused

  he had started out for al-mar-
wazis -house as the most likely place
for khadija to have sought a retreat
acting as she had done no doubt with
the cognizance and aid of kula but
suddenly he knew that she was no
longer there

  where was she

  he lifted the double - eye once
more above his head and looked up

   i asked you he averred

  over toward the back of the ma-
mangno across the marsh- jungle
there came the sound of scattered
firing

  your answer he asked

  the double-eye seemed to twist
his arm while a spasm of fierce joy
swept into his heart the double-eye
had answered him

  he plunged into a path he had
known ever since his boyhood he
was running as swiftly and securely
as that young lion he had released a
little while ago must be running now

  he ran into an arab patrol there
to head the dawn-maker off if he at-
tempted to escape in the midst of
them as dim as a wraith of vapor in
a cave he saw her for whom he
sought

  without a word with scarcely a
sound he charged

      chapter xli
       so endeth empire

not until he had struck once
twice thrice with such brutal
force that the terrible whip
might as well have been a simitar did
he utter a word and then it was to
khadija

  run run i shall follow you

  but instead of running khadija
snatched a rifle from one of the reel-
ing men and fired it twice without
lifting it at two rearing shadows to
the left

  a moment later she was swept
from her feet swooning weak and

abu was leaping forward with her in
his arms

  he crouched and was off the path
as a rippingfusillar came hurtling
after them he made his way care-
fully along a fallen log in darkness
that would have made the road im-
possible to one bred to a different
school again found solid ground

  he went along for a while as
stealthily as a man-eating tiger ap-
proaches a village not even a dog
could have heard him there was no
dashing recklessness now he had
khadija to protect

  he held her close she reached up
and put her arms about his neck he
knelt with her for a moment pressed
his lips to hers while his heart
pounded

   let me walk she whispered
o abu i have found thee 

  not more than ten yards away was
the report of another rifle the line
was drawing close they were within
that line

  there was no outlet by the beach
to escape through the jungly swamp
on either side of the mamangno ex-
cept by the paths would have been
well-nigh impossible even had abu
been alone with khadija it was
altogether impossible

  it was increasingly clear that the
cordon had been tightly drawn across
the back of the old fortress there
also he could have fought his way
through had he only himself to look
out for

  he got away from the danger-zone
as rapidly as possible and was well
up the slope of the mamangno before
he paused again

  there he knelt again to rest to
catch his breath to think to speak
they were on a path that only he
could see khadija crouched on the
ground and huddled close into his
arms like a frightened child

   i came to find thee she whis-
pered now we are together

   i must give you up said abu
then held his breath for her answer


all-story weekly

  w answer came his hand stole
softly to her face it was as he sus-
pected there were tears

  he pressed her to him tenderly

he would have kissed her again but
he did not dare he wanted to keep
his head cool he was trying to think
trying to see clearly as he had done
so often before in his life

  it wasnt death that frightened
him not in the least he would have
charged his enemies again as gladly
as he had a little while ago and
broken through the lines

  what frightened him was the mem-
ory of what he had seen back there
on the path through the swamp kha-
dija an east-coast prisoner it made
him sick

  what if he hadnt found her what
if the double-eye had not led him to
the place where she was what if he
had been killed too soon

  khadija was whispering to him
but his thought had been so intense
that at first he did not get the purport
of what she was saying

  -because life without thee would
not be life so i left al-marwazis
house and crept out along the beach
but saw other armed men who talked
of slaying thee and then i took the
path to the right - and there -saw
other men i sought to pass them i
ran they fired still other men ap-
peared in front of me-

  my khadia 

   my heart cried out to thee twas
all i asked-thou and death and
now thou sayest thou must give me
up 

   it was on your account 

   abu

   say on

   what saidst thou about the door
of death abu thy khadija sought
to pray she asked that she lie not
leit in darkness when thou passest
through that she grope not for thy
hand in vain that she call thee not
in loneliness anil silence abu the
night waneth perchance our door
shall open with the dawn

  abu kissed her again and he was
llooded with such mad joy as he had
never known before

  he arose and gathered her up in
his arms again he stood there peer-
ing for a moment straight ahead

  he saw a dim shape the sheen of
two eyes heard the breathing of a
lion silently he said

   you are hungry but i am he who
set you free

  as silently as it had appeared the
lion was gone again

  abu went slowly now as one who
performs some sacred rite

  it was a rite

  he was bringing back his bride to
his mothers house so his heart
sang for his heart was unburdened
as it had not been since the night that
the breath of allah blew khadijas
hair against his face

  he had asked the mother of the
world for peace his prayer was
answered

  they came to the top of the hill to
the edge of the cleared space and
there abu put khadija down she
stood at his side with her arm around
him she looked up at him

   oh abu she thrilled softly
 we are home 

 home

  the word smote his heart brought
a lump to his throat and filled him
with such intense joy that there was
a painin his chest

  the place was deserted as when he
left it only the cattle were still
there and they mooed and moaned a
welcome for they knew that the lion
was lurking about and they were
glad to see this man and woman who
for them were as gods no doubt

  but the gold tent of the dawn-
maker was still there under the cala-
bash-tree and the lesser tent at its
side the fire was dying down but
it still cast a red glow over every-
thing-

  ft cast a red glow over the deserted
throne-chair that had been brought
tip from al-marwazis house
abu the dawn-maker



  abu pressed khadija to his side

   throne he said  you have em-
 braced how many men were they
 happier for that was the world
 gladder you have led a harlot life 

  he smiled down at khadija he
was pleased with his fancy so was
she

   burn it she said  well offer
 it up as a sacrifice

   o - ho  cried abu  that all
 thrones could be burned as a sacri-
 fice

  he seized it and dragged it for-
 ward it must have weighed two hun-
 dred pounds but he picked it up and
 cast it to the center of the fiery heap

  there was a curl of yellow smoke
 that instantly grew in volume the
 liames caught and the throne began
 to blaze

  they watched it fascinated

   see how the flames leap upward
 said khadija  as if they were glad 

   thev are glad because they go
 upward said abu

   we are flames said khadija

  of the one firesaid abu

   so also shall we be glad

  she smiled up at him weirdly and
 tenderly with the firelight on her face

  yea whispered abu so ends
empire so begins life

  they passed through the door of
 die tent

chapter xlii

on the mamangnos bosom

there was but little change ap-
parent in the interior of the tent
the lamps that had been lighted
earlier in the night were still burning
the curtains hung in place through
the raised partition walls wras kha-
dijas divan with its tumbled cushions

  inanimate objects have a way of
 speaking their indifference to human
 change

  khadija and abu paused just in-
 side the door and looked about them

  i thirst said abu and you

  thou art my husband cried
khadija like a child who proposes a
game  and thou hast just returned
from thy work and i-i am thy wife
who hasteneth to prepare thy sup-
per 

  nay cried abu you are the
bride and i am the bridegroom and
you command the wedding-feast

  he kissed her and she ran away

  he looked back through the door
of the tent it was almost dawn

  on the floor of the tent he found
two things that had been overlooked
by the looters in their haste and ex-
citement one of tiiese was an an-
tique ring the other was a bracelet
likewise of antique workmanship

  he looked at them curiously and
was about to toss them to one side
when khadija returned

  she carried an earthenware jug
and a painted cup

   fami hid this-palm-wine of the
best - to quench thy thirst and to
bring thee back thy strength what
hast thou there rest sweet abu
sit down besjjde me here  the divan

   your wedding present my kha-
di ja see the ring of some long-dead
princess the bracelet of some old
king

  they were seated side by side on
the edge of the low divan abu took
khadijas hand and kissed it and
slipped the ring on her thumb

  poor little princess khadija
sighed  even if thou wert a prin-
cess thou must have loved and suf-
fered and wept and had thine hour
of almost killing maddening happi-
ness even as i nay nay not the
bracelet that was the kings give
it to me abu now it is mine 

  she had taken the bracelet and
was pressing his arm against her
breast as if she asked a gift that he
might refuse

  all yours my goddess - bride 
said abu

   then see  she began to fasten
it about his wrist  then i give it
to thee say that thou wilt never part
	all-story weekly

with it that it is thine that it is a
gift from thy khadija

   i say all of that and also that 
love you as no man ever loved woman
as allah loved a mat and thus brought
love into jhe world

   oh abu  let thee thirst 

  you are my life-giver

   i love thee so 

   love gives life 

   more than vows-

   love is the universal vow
thrilled abu  keep that and all
other vows are vain give me the
cup nay hold it to my lips

  into the silence that fell upon them
there came the sound of a bird-song
they looked into each others eyes
they recognized it they had heard
it together on the shore it announced
the coming of the day

   yea khadija abu whispered
 thus begins life

  thou art the maker of the
dawn khadija answered

  he put his arms about her

  the bird sang again there came
the chirp and twitter of other birds
the cattle lowed for they were
thirsty and soon they could go down
from the hill to drink

   hast thou not made the dawn
for me and thee khadija whis-
pered tenderly her breath on his face
 o abu is not this the dawn of
creation with a new paradise swim-
ming out of the darkness and only
one man and one woman in it

   you are the dawn-maker not
i abu answered with a straining
heart  see for thirty years i exist-
ed for these thirty minutes have i
lived oh now i know why they call
allah the compassionate

  for a period the earth seemed to
have been engulfed in an atmosphere
so fine that it vibrated and sang to the
music of the universe responded to
no other sound time stood still or
sped over centuries and eons

  it was the dawn in cosmos to
which they had each referred de-
struction and sudden death beset

them on every side and yet they were

as unconscious of these things as if
they had been moats dancing in a
sunbeam-as perhaps they were

  yet the night was fading the
mamangno as if regretfully was
getting up from a bed of mist

  the arabs portuguese and british
-the latter leing the eternal law-giv-
ers in these regions-had drawn their
cordon tighter and tighter around the
mother of the world all of her
children who would had been permit-
ted to escape-all save this last one
who was there now with this bride of
his clever arab scouts as stealthy
as tigers and as cogent as hate had
made themselves as certain of this as
they could be

  but when captain berwind of the
vanity learned that the camp was
still standing he decided to try the
place out with a shell or two before
undertaking the final charge

   i thought of you abu whis-
pered  when i told them that the
other word for dawn was love

  there came a shaking detonation
from the east an eery roar the thun-
derous shock of an exploding shell

  khadija let out a quavering little
cry

   they kill thee

   they cannot kill me abu an-
swered  like this wrell live for-
ever

  he strained her to his breast and
lifted his head

  the stampeding cattle were rushing
past a second shell fell and exploded
closer than the first the war - ship
was getting the range

  shall we flee khadija

  he asked it although he knew
there was little hope

  nay nay she answered with
joy  we stand together at the
door

  the second shell or the third must
have found the fire and sent its em-
bers againt the front of the tent for
it began to burn it flamed up eager-
abu the dawn-maker



ly as if it also were through with
earth glad to go abu staggered to
his feet and still held khadija close

  there was a cessation of the bom-
bardment while the fire burned
brightly and more brightly still and
they could look out through the drop-
ping curtains to the jungle-fringe to
the red - and - purple sea the rising
glory of the sun and in the midst of
it all mans instrument of destruc-
tion the dim gray cruiser

  the sun sent its light in upon them
and clothed them with its warmth

   our dawn said khadija

   the eternal dawn 

  he pressed his lips to hers

  time ceased to exist for them
they seemed to be on the threshold
of infinity at last

  then with one accord they were
speeding together down the flank of
the mamangno it was as if the sun
had brought them another sort of
light than that which it brought to
the rest of the world it was as if in
response to their supreme prayers and
their supreme faith they had been
granted a vision

  somewhere near the foot of the
hill they encountered a squad of brit-
ish marines immaculate and white in
charge of a young lieutenant and
the lieutenant stared at them curious-
ly murmured the one magical word
u white and let them pass

  they came out on the golden beach
in the almost blinding light of the
rising sun dawn indeed

the

   t hey were hailed by a voice they
recognized and they saw rennyvo
rushing upon them

  the dhow awaits you cried
rennyvo  we couldnt go away
without you glory to the name of
the most high glory to the maker
of the dawn and to his chosen bride
they steered to the east with the
whole visible world above and about
them  enameled in fire abu and
khadija were in the bow of the boat
their arms about each other

  yea god whispered abu
 this is empire thou hast given
me liberty thou hast given me love
thou hast given me sorrow brother
you also will see it-the dawn of
dawns-the sunrise of the soul 

   there are stories on the east coast
 stories current among the people that
 will be handed down for generations
 perhaps to pave the way for some
 new prophet in ages to come they
 tell of abu the dawn-maker of his
 humble origin his conquests his say-
 ings his miracles

   and greatest of all the miracles that
 are recounted of him is that of how
 abu surrounded by his enemies fired
 upon by the white mens war-ship
 was snatched bodily to paradise from
 mamangno mother of the world
 together with the woman who clung
 to him in the face of death

  and abu in his wonderful new
world with khadija beside him would
perhaps admit its truth

y	partner had heartlessly de-
serted me to consort with a
sallow - complected youth
and i had paused in a door-
way to watch the dancers
whirl by and listen to the
music

 it was then that i looked up sudden-
ly to behold old dr bertrand tread-
ing his way toward me and to fear the
worst

 sure enough the old sawbones
hove to alongside and buttonholed me
to resume an argument that i supposed
had been settled-if not to his satisfac-
tion at least to mine

  but sir he wheezed with pom-
pous dignity blood will tell i say
it this conceited upstart - this un-
couth farmer-dares show his face
here to-night he will be ruined world
without end politically and bless
your sweet life he knows it 

  dare is hardly the word doctor
i objected shaking my head  re-
member that i have seen sheriff boyd
put to the test if he fails to show up
here to-night it will not be because of
rupert nor major ware all that can
keep him back will be respect for the
occasion

  i flung my arm out in a gesture that
included the dancers in the hall the
senile gossipers in the big room across
the hall - even the dusky musicians
screened behind palms

   times have changed i reminded
the old aristocrat he had singled me
out as a target for his wrath it seemed
-no doubt because he knew that sher-
iff boyd was my old schoolmate and
boyhood friend  a great moral
wave is sweeping the country but
that is not the point doctor the
point is that a sheriff-any sheriff-
who fails to enforce the law as he
finds it is not a capable official

   but poker-playing dr bertrand
exclaimed - one might have supposed
that he had mentioned the most honor-
able occupation in the world  who-
ever heard of a man being arrested in
this county for playing poker

   poker-playing has descended to a
lower level since the days of the  gen-
tlemans game  i argued  but
poker - playing forgery or horse-
racing-its ail one to the majesty of
law a sheriff-

  i had other sound and reasonable
arguments in mind but was not given
an opportunity to present them a
commotion near the front door arrest-
ed my attention

  those who stood nearest the en-
trance were greeting a newcomer a
man whose broad-brimmed black hat
floated above the swaying dancers like
the head-dress of a giant jesuit

  our question was answered the
sheriff had come

  i turned on dr bertrand with a


bad blood and blue	

cynical smile-a smile however that
escaped his attention he too had
seen the big felt hat with the wide
brim and the pale serious face of
jerry boyd beneath it

  for a moment my old friend-for
dr bertrand was an old friend too-
was swept off his feet so to speak by
the turn of events

  well ill be - jiggered he
wheezed in a tone almost as emphatic
as profanity

  down the long dance-hall came
jerry boyd keeping well out of the
circle of waltzers and glancing about
sharply

  i supposed he was seeking young
rupert ware but found that i was
mistaken

  as boyd came down the hall he in-
quired for major ware and having
found and addressed the major the
two of them came toward the door of
the smoking-room where we were
standing major ware in the lead

  trouble of some kind was brewing-
on riverside plantation

  i knew it and old dr bertrand
knew it and the tall young sheriff
knew it better than either of us al-
though to my mind he was more tran-
quil than any of our bidden guests
but he knew the wares an excitable
quick-tempered  breed - men and
women

  if he didnt know them he was to
learn something of their fiery nature
when he came face to face with helen
ware on the edge of the circle of
merry-makers

  short hot words passed between
them the rapid speech of ruffled tem-
per and as i moved a step nearer i
caught a fragment of the girls mono-
tone which reminded me of the buzz-
ing of an angry bee

  -and if you humiliate me here
before my guests i heard her warn
him  i shall never-

   never speak to you again no
doubt but of that i cannot be sure
the sheriff was making a futile effort
to explain

    im not to blame helen he whis-
pered-every word i fancied falling
on unheeding ears  if only you
will-

  a sudden discordant squawk of the
bass violin drowned his words and
before the heavy notes had ebbed
helen was moving majestically down
the hall

  boyd checked himself when he real-
ized that by the simple expedient of
leaving him the girl had contrived to
avoid an argument

  his face was a flaming red as he
shouldered his way through the door
and halted expectantly in the center of
the smoking-room certainly he could
not have been highly pleased with the
way events were shaping up for the
good opinion of this one girl meant
more to him as i happened to know
than the good opinion of all the other
wares combined

  i followed behind the sheriff and
saw major ware circle the table for
which i was thankful and turn de-
fiantly to face the intruder

  one or two of the loungers under-
standing that the interview was of a
private nature rose languidly from
their seats and edged toward the door
but major ware halted all of us with
upraised hand

    and now sir he said turning to
boyd again  what can i do for you
i understand you come in an - ah -
official capacity

   my business is with your son-
with rupert ware boyd rejoined
briskly  i thought it best-that is
as a matter of courtesy major ware

i have come to you first no doubt
you have been advised that i have a
warrant for rupert

  good heavens sir the major
exploded  youre all-fired civil i
must say-breaking in on a dance to
serve a warrant you thought my son
would run away i suppose-like a
thief in the night 

    i will admit that i had reasons to
believe your son might try to escape
said boyd gravely  in fact he sent


all-story weekly

me word that he intends to leave the
county and that  had better not inter-
fere i had to take him at his word
major i did not intend to interrupt

the dance

   the-you didnt  roared the

major who was casting about for a
chance to shift the burden of fault
 you came here to be in the lime-
light didnt you - to advertise this
thing from one end of the county to
the other

   i call on you to witness gentle-
men - he indicated our little group
by a sweep of his hand - i call on
you to witness how this man has gone
out of his way to insult me i want
you to observe and to bear in mind
what i have to say i pledge you my
word this man will never again be
sheriff of sheridan county 

  the major flung this defiance not at
the silent and abashed sheriff who
stood twirling his hat on his fore-
finger but at the half dozen of us
strung about the room in awkward
poses

  i supposed all of us realized its sig-
nificance for major ware when he
was pleased to take a hand could
make himself a power in sheridan
county politics

  we watched the two men as they
stood and surveyed each other like
cocks in a pit the major glaring fierce-
ly and boyd returning the stare with
a calmness that i was forced to ad-
mire then the door to the rear porch
flew open admitting a draft of fresh
air and with it young rupert ware
himself red-faced and perspiring

  i for one noticed that the boy had
been drinking all of us observed the
pistol in his hand

  behind us the rollicking strains of
music rose and fell without a pause
the door stood ajar but the dancers
were as if in a world apart from the
little by-play in the smoking-room
only two of the young jeople-helen
and natalie ware--knew why sheriff
boyd had come to the riverside dance

  rupert held his pose too long for the

startling effect he had planned but
finally lie spoke

  here  am jerry boyd - why
dont you take me he blazed out
sneeringly  you say you have a war-
rant for me why dont you serve it 
the sheriff met ruperts defiant
stare without flinching-a cynical
tolerant smile masking any anger he
may have felt

   you have the advantage i be-
lieve he admitted  i supposed you
would go peaceably rupert you are
a man of good family i-well the
fact is i havent a gun

  he made this announcement apolo-
getically certainly without the faintest
trace of anger yet his veiled sarcasm
stung the pampered youth to the quick

  you lie rupert cried his thin
high-pitched voice rising almost to a
shriek  youre afraid to shoot it out
with me-thats what you havent
the nerve of a-a calf 

  boyd shrugged his shoulders and
made a sudden conciliatory gesture
with outstretched palms

   any man in the room want to
search me he suggested i
came on duty- 

   dont give me that hang-dog
spiel clear out of here terry bovd
-and dont ever come back

  boyd glanced at the major for con-
firmation of this sullen command

  the stern old planter stared back
frigidly

  i saw there was no sympathy for
my tall friend in that quarter and i
found myself sighing as it came home
to me that the major was taking a
stand for the first time in his life
against law and order

  boyd also sighed

    ill go he said  but before i
go i want to warn you that we are
going to serve this warrant if it takes
a month ill bring my gun next
time if youre spoiling for a fight
he lifted his wide black hat from
the table and placcd it gently on his
head seeming to reconsider he re-
moved the hat and stepped back a
bad blood and blue



pace still facing the major and the
jatters irate son

   major ware lie began clearing
his throat in an embarrassed manner
 you are a citizen of some standing
in the community you ought to use
your influence to- 

   theres the door  the major
thundered  good-night sir  

  boyd smiled grimly clapped his hat
back on his head bowed profoundly
and left the room

  in the hall he met helen ware on
the arm of a perspiring youth who
begged to be represented on her pro-
gram card and seemed loathe to ac-
cept no for an answer

  boyd removed his hat again and
faced the majors elder daughter

   i just wanted to tell you-  he
began briskly and paused

  without deigning to notice him in
the least helen swept down the hall
on the arm of her escort leaving the
sheriff staring after her in some con-
fusion

  we were to take the boat for new
orleans the next afternoon-major
ware his two daughters dr bert-
rand and myself and the five of us
were grouped at the ware landing
when the nancy lee paused at the
bank with throbbing engines to take
us on board

  the ware landing was an adjunct
to the ware plantation a private
landing seldom used and a few boxes
of freight were piled up for down-
river points

  within five minutes the last of
these boxes had been hoisted on board
and the captain gave the signal to
cast off

  the roustabouts darted down the
stage planks but a voice from high
above us halted them at the stakes

  hold up the pilot yelled in a
deep-toned river accent

   glanced aloft and beheld the vet-
eran riverman framed like a giant
spider behind his wheel he was
staring across the fields at something

screened from our sight by the sandy
bluff

  two minutes later a horseman
dashed up and dismounted passed his
reins to a negro ran down the bank
and flung himself on board

   i recognized our belated passenger
the moment he came into view i
recognized him by his tall well knit
frame and the broad-brimmed black
hat he wore but why sheriff boyd
had decided at the last minute to fol-
low our party was beyond my com-
prehension

    youre an unexpected guest was
my greeting when he had trudged up
the boiler deck stairs and joined me-
 an unwelcome guest i might add
if youre looking for rupert ware
youre on a cold trail

 boyd glanced over his broad shoul-
der toward the ladies cabin and i
could almost read his thoughts
helen ware who had been standing
at my side had retreated in that
direction the moment she recognized
her whilom lover-had flown i am
tempted to say

  some one was thrumming on the
piano in the cabin but it was not
helen i knew whose sly fingers
were toying with the ivory keys and
matching them with a perfect white-
ness no musical instrument could
remain at peace while natalie ware
was around

  boyd sighed as he turned back and
watched the crew cast off

    not so cold perhaps as you im-
agine he mused after a little
 your brother-in-law-to-be is on the
boat

    foiled again   i chuckled  i
saw every man who stepped on board
and rupert was not among those
present youd better back up and
take a fresh start

   do you know who boarded the
nancy lee at ellis island j 

  oh thats it i gasped he
caught the boat at ellis island

   and brought along his body-
guard-joe hardin and ad morris


all-story weekly

im going to take the three of them
off at bodfish landing herbert i
shall try them single-handed but i
may have to call to you for a little
help before its over

   count on me i boasted  ive
never had a chance to put my com-
mission as a deputy to any practical
use i believe you appointed me just
because i voted for you id have
taken a hand last night if you had
once chirped

  last night boyd laughed and
instantly became serious again  i
dont like for that boy to make a mon-
key out of me as he did last night

   its the first time i have ever seen
you back down from a business prop-
osition jerrv but of course i un-
derstand why you couldnt have
done otherwise	

  boyd smiled a grave mirthless
smile

   you dont understand at all he
assured me im a changed man
herbert i picked up a novel at a
circulating library the other day-
you know ive never had much edu-
cation and ive been reading a little
well this book taught me a lesson
its called  the virginian -per-
haps youve read it that virginian
was true blue he was metal of the
right sort

   theres no great honor or glory
in going around with a chip on your
shoulder the bravest man is not al-
ways a loud talker-like that man
tram pas for example

   better tell dr bertrand and
major ware that theyve never
given you credit for much nerve i
fancy

   they may be nearer right than
you imagine i was a little like ru-
pert myself once but im older now
-much older nerve is not to be
measured by the length of a six-
shooter i like that virginian tie
went about his business in a quiet
way no fuss and feathers but when
it came to the scratch he was jolmny-
on-the-spot

  i saw natalie ware come out of
the ladies cabin she paused a mo-
ment on her way to the texas deck
and made a wry grimace at boyds
back

  i smiled and turned again to the

sheriff

   youd better be careful how you
go at rupert i warned him

   i know it what that boy needs
is a good spanking and hell get it
some day but therell be no shoot-
ing ill not have a mans blood-
any mans blood-on my hands

  he paused and stared again toward
the cabin major ware and dr
bertrand were approaching arm in
arm each swung a heavy cane in
his free hand and the grayness of
the doctors heavy mustache reflected
the majors grizzly goatee

  i was satisfied the old cronies knew
that sheriff boyd was on board and
that rupert was on board too-cir-
cumstances that did not augur well
for a pleasant voyage but it was
obvious that they had determined to
ignore the sheriff altogether for they
veered toward a pair of cane chairs
by the guard rail and did not even so
much as glance in our direction

  when i looked around again boyd
was edging away

  where to i asked

   the card room he shot back at
me in a brisk undertone  i think
my men are there

  i stared after him until he ducked
his head to enter the main cabin door
as he passed out of sight natalie
ware came tripping down from the
upper deck her face a wonderful
flush of pink

   what is that man doing on board
this boat she demanded of me

   he came aboard to arrest ru-
pert t said  and i think hell do
it too

  and you patronize him she
protested with feminine lack of logic
 youre not playing fair with us
herbert you know he is our en-
emy
bad blood and blue



   in the first place lie is not vour
enemy i replied  in the second
place he is your friend and mine
furthermore the only enemy in the
world rupert has is himself and the
men he associates with isnt rupert
amenable to the law the same as the
rest of us 

  dangerous ground this you will
perceive but i was determined to
have done with beating about the
bush and to speak my mind

   not to a trumped-up charge a
frame-up- 

  well if theres a frame-up he
has a good case in court and should
stand his trial at any rate jerry is
but an agent of the court the grand
jury indicted rupert for poker play-
ing-for being a common gambler

   now youre trying to pick a quar-
rel she exclaimed pouting more
feminine logic you will see

  not at all im trying to show
you where boyd is right and the rest
of ou are wrong i would- 

  the provoking creature stopped
her ears with the ends of her fore-
fingers and began waltzing back-
ward i started toward her in pur-
suit whereupon she wheeled and ran

  just as she flitted by the cabin sky-
lights on the larboard i caught her
around the waist and kissed her

  it was childs play of course but
we were both rather young and
rather foolish

  we strolled forward again hand
in hand the major and the doctor
had deserted their post by the guard
rail and as we reached the edge of
the cabin the coarse whistle overhead
signaled for bodfish landing re-
minding me sharply of boyds visit to
the card room

  i began wondering what had been
the outcome of that visit there had
been no pistol shots no unusual noise
who had been victor in that quiet
contest of nerve and will power

  sheriff boyds position was anom-
alous whatever the outcome of his
visit to the nancy lee

  if lie permitted rupert to brow-
beat him from the line of his duty
he was a coward in the eyes of helen
ware if he took rupert prisoner
by force he would be considered a
bully inconsiderate of her feelings
if he should shoot rupert in self de-
fense he would be a murderer

  because of this peculiar style of
reasoning my friend was doomed at
the outset to lose the ladys favor

  i knew what boyd would do he
would arrest rupert ware even
though helen should never speak to
him again yet he would have to
make quick work of it for bodfish
landing was only a mile inside the
county line

  the cabin door flew open almost
in our faces and out trotted boyd
with his prisoners rupert and the
two disreputable gamblers the two
men who were to blame for the boys
dissipations

  the prisoners walked across the
deck abreast rupert in the center
and boyd followed close at their
heels

  behind boyd came major ware
who was calling  high heaven to
witness that there would be a sequel
to the days events

  i had a feeling of pity for the old
fire-eater he avas approaching sev-
enty i remembered and growing
more childish every day

  but it was plain that helen ware
neither asked nor received pitv as she
stepped out on deck her cheeks scar-
let and her eyes flashing a silent wit-
ness of her brothers degradation i
knew her well enough to know that
she would not have interceded with
boyd at that moment at any price
not even if she had known that a
word from her would have brought
about the boys release

  a princess of the house of haps-
burg could not have been more
sulkily proud

  the sheriff went about his task
with calm precision i fancied that
he could almost feel the looks that


all-story weekly

were as daggers aimed at his broad

back

  but if he realized that the wares
were marking him down in their
books for slaughter both in love and
in politics nothing in his manner in-
dicated that he cared very much one
way or the other and i admired his
firmness in that

  the lxat was within fifty yards of
the shore by this time circling down
slowly like a swooping hawk on the
half submerged barge that was used
for a landing

  boyd marched his men down the
boiler-deck stairs ignoring the black
looks and muttered imprecations be-
hind him-not the least being those
of old dr bertrand-and lined his
men on the port freight deck

  none of us followed the quartet
downstairs we stood in a row by
the guard rail on the upper deck and
looked on without a word

  i kept my eyes on rupert ware
for i knew that the sulky youths
spirit of resistance was not broken
completely as the boat neared the
landing barge i saw rupert creeping
nearer to the edge of the deck and
t began to wonder if already he had
conceived some plan of escape

  he had sworn that jerry boyd
would never take him prisoner and
nothing would be too bold for him to
attempt

  he had planned a means of escape
for when the engines stopped and the
boat continued plowing the water bv
the force of its own momentum i
could see rupert measuring the dis-
tance that separated him from the
landing barge

  when not more than six feet of
turbid water lay between the two
hulls he crouched to half his height
and leaped into the air across the in-
tervening space

  by less than six inches ho fell short
of the mark as his feet went down
into the water he reached out with
both hands and grasped the edge of
the landing barge

  the river beneath him was ten feet

deep-and the boy could not swim a
stroke but more to be dreaded
than that all of us realized that when
the hulls crashed together rupert
would ije ground into a shapeless
mass

  there was one chance-a slim one
if the pilot overhead had seen the
lads attempt to escape and had time
lie might port his helm and keep the
crafts apart

  that chance went by m a flash
high above the scene on the freight
deck the pilot had observed ruperts
predicament and was spinning his
wheel with all his might-uselessly

  nothing but a miracle could pre-
vent the boat with the momentum it
had gained from crashing into the
barge

  we who stood on the boiler deck
were helpless i shot a swift glance
down the rail and for many a day
i shall remember the picture i saw

  major ware stood with one hand
on the guard rail the other clutching
his half-raised cane his mouth open
his breath coming in short quick
gasps helen ware still in an atti-
tude of stiff disdain stood with
blanched cheeks

  natalies actions were quicker
she had sunk into a chair and cov-
ered her face with her hands to shut
out the horrible sight we expected to
see

  sheriff boyd alone retained a per-
fect presence of mind rupert him-
self was paralyzed with fear other-
wise he might have saved himself by
putting forth a superhuman effort
and scrambling on board the barge

  this was his one chance but his
mind was too slow of action to
seize it

  the current swept the boat toward
the barge with incredible swiftness
the ribbon of murky water between
the two hulls narrowed

  five feet-four feet-three feet

    brother 

  the word leaped in a shrill appeal
bad blood and blue



from helens white lips-an appeal
to rupert not to suffer himself to be
crushed to death it might have
been considered an appeal to boyd
too for the sheriff instantly flung
himself headlong from the deck

  i held my breath in anxious sus-
pense would there be two deaths in-
stead of one-two men crushed be-
tween the timbers

  boyd seized rupert around the
waist but rupert clung to the barge
in a frenzy of fear a foolish no-
tion seemed to have possessed him
that safety lay in holding on but the
sheriffs weight tore his fingers loose
one by one

  ruperts head and the sheriffs feet
went out of sight at the same mo-
ment the next instant the heavy
timbers of the water-soaked hulls
came together in a shock that caused
the nancy lee to quiver like a leaf
in the wind

  the boat was headed up-stream
but it drifted slowly with the current
the water above the submerged men
was covered by the two dark hulls

  all the boats officers could do was
to let the nancy lee drift

  we floated three feet or more away
from the barge all of us with our
eyes glued to the place where the men
wrent down it did not occur to us
so panic-stricken were we that they
might come to the surface elsewhere

  twenty feet forward of the boat
two heads bobbed up as one and

boyd began spouting water and air
spasmodically from his mouth and
nose breathless almost lifeless he
was barely able to keep his half
strangled prisoner afloat

  but as they drifted down-stream
the roustabouts ran forward at a sig-
nal from the captain and hoisted
them on deck where they lay panting
on a pile of cordage

  twenty minutes later the captain
bustled forward

   well what are you going to do 
he shouted at our group  i cant
be kept waiting here all day

  old dr bertrand primed himself
at once for a farewell speech

   sir he said addressing boyd
 i am happy to say that you have
proved your mettle i am told your
grandfather was a hero of the mexi-
can war and as i have always said
sir blood will tell- 

    thank you very kindly doctor
boyd said laughing and cutting short
the threatened speech  and now
we must be going-

  he motioned for his prisoners to
go  ashore the went along as
obediently as lambs and boyd turned
to shake hands with us one by one

  last in line stood helen ware
blushing and smiling-far from de-
fiant

   good-by-god bless you   was
her fervent prayer  ill write when
i get to new orleans

t was after miss henrietta
tripp quit boarding and be-
gan to keep house that she
acquired the habit of asking
her nieces to visit her this
they strongly suspected was
because miss henrietta
could neither cook herself nor keep a
maid beyond her first pay-day

   miss henrietta was a forceful per-
son of an exacting nature and even
the nieces found it necessary to come
in relays three months for each

  eileens turn came just before
thanksgiving the family en masse
went with her to the station and saw
her depart with many misgivings

  for eileen was a gentle incompe-
tent person not at all like her bustling
capable sisters and they were firmly
of the opinion that while eileen might
be able to stand miss henrietta yet
miss henrietta could not possibly
stand eileen

   the day after eileens arrival miss
henrietta according to her usual cus-
tom handed her a roll of bills

     hats the housekeeping money
for three months she said  you
will do all the ordering and pay all the
bills  dislike petty housekeeping de-
tails and do not wish to be bothered
with them

   she left the gasping eileen standing
in the middle of the kitchen floor and

went out to feed the dozen chickens
that she insisted upon keeping to her
own inconvenience and the exaspera-
tion of her neighbors who objected to
being wakened before daylight by the
noisy crowing of a rooster

  eileen mechanically clutching the
money and dazedly repeating  house-
keeping money for three months had
not moved when a shrill scream from
the back yard jarred her into action

  she ran out to find that miss hen-
rietta had slipped on a bit of ice
treacherously concealed under the
newly fallen snow and lay in a crum-
pled heap with one leg twisted under
her she groaned with pain when
eileen attempted to help her to her
feet

   go next door she said  and get
some one to help carry me in ive
broken something i guess

  miss henriettas surmise proved to
be entirely correct the something
being her hip

   youll be laid up for three
months the doctor told her-and said
something about a hospital

  but miss henrietta very decidedly
negatived the suggestion

   your bill she snapped at the doc-
tor  will probably he all  want to
pay ill stay where i am and you
ncedent bring any nurse here either
my niece wilj look after me


a course of sprouts



  the doctor turned a doubtful eye in
eileens direction but he knew miss
henrietta and recognized the useless-
ness of attempting to argue with her
so he put her in a plaster cast gave
eileen the necessary instructions for
her care and went away

  it was the next morning that eileen
tidying her aunts room put a hesita-
ting question

   the money that you gave me yes-
terday she said  is it to pay for
everything for three months

   yes said miss henrietta very
firmly

  eileen sighed

   i dont see she said  how it can
possibly be made to do that

   its what i gave rose and marga-
ret and barbara when they were here
miss henrietta told her  xand its
plenty

  eileen would have attempted a fur-
ther protest but she dared not for
miss henrietta it was plain to see
was rapidly growing belligerent and
the doctor had said that above all
things she must be kept quiet and
un worried

  eileen carried her aunts breakfast-
tray down-stairs and began thought-
fully to wash the dishes

   i suppose she told herself mourn-
fully  its just as theyve always said
at home-im not capable like the
other girls and cant do things the way
they can but how they ever managed
to keep house for three months on that
little bit of money  do not see

  she wiped a plate and set it on the
table and her soft mouth set suddenly
in a firm straight line

  if they did it she said  so can

i	i can and i will ill show aunt
henrietta 

  the little bell she had left with miss
henrietta to summon her if she was
wanted rang decidedly and she went
back up-stairs

   eileen directed her aunt  dont
forget to feed the chickens give them
the breakfast scraps and-

   there arent any scraps eileen

objected promptly  i knew what
you wanted to eat and i knew what i
wanted to eat and i cooked just that
there was nothing left

   then feed them out of the bag of
chicken-feed thats on the back porch
said miss henrietta  no scraps
she was thinking after eileen went
out  rose and margaret and bar-
bara always had scraps then she
laughed  eileen has more sense than
they think she said

  eileen let the chickens out of their
tight little house and watched them eat
the grain she scattered for them

  they were a hungry lot and it was
plain that what was left of the bag of
corn would not last long eileen eyed
them speculatively

   theyd make a lot of broth she
decided the doctor had ordered
broth for miss henrietta

  three days later miss henrietta
dining with difficulty because she had
not yet accustomed herself to taking
her food while in a recumbent position
remarked casually that she had not
heard the rooster crowing that morn-
ing

   eileen flushed guiltily 

   he-he froze his feet she ex-
plained after a moments hesitation

   i was not aware said miss hen-
rietta dryly  that he crowed with his
feet

   i couldnt do anything for his
feet said eileen nervously  and so
i-that is-

  she paused her eyes fastened on
miss henriettas soup bowl

  miss henrietta followed the direc-
tion of her nieces glance  oh  
she said and took another spoonful
of soup well she pronounced
 he made good soup at any rate i
suppose she went on probingly
 none of the others show signs of
frozen feet

  eileen quaked

  all her life she had followed the
path of least resistance letting other
people choose her opinions for her just
as they did her clothes she had never


all-story weekly

thought for herselfbecause no one had
ever expected her to and it had not
been necessary now she had been
suddenly forced out of her accustomed
groove and no one could possibly un-
derstand how terrified she was

   that big plymouth rock hen
she said in a voice that shook in spite
of her effort to control it  seems to
-to be limping a little

  the plymouth rock had been select-
ed by eileen fur the next victim be-
cause she had the largest appetite

   its very strange about their feet
said miss henrietta they went
through all last winter without any-
thing happening to them and-

   if you want to see their feet-
flashed eileen almost too quickly

   ive already told you miss hen-
rietta came back also with suspicious
readiness  that i do not wish to be
bothered with tiresome details of
course i understand youll do the best
you can with the chickens but if any
more of them do freeze their feet why
its better to make soup out of them
than to let them go about suffering

  she tilted her bowl and took the last
spoonful  you make very good
soup she complimented  who
taught you  

   no one said eileen  i never
made soup until i came here at
home mother makes it or barbara
but i know how it ought to taste when
its done and if yon know how a thing
ought to be when its finished all you
have to do is to keep at it until it is
that way

  humph said miss henrietta
 you never got that recipe out of a
book

  no said eileen seriously out
of my head

ii

  a month later mrs carrington
keith came

  mrs keith was eileens married sis-
ter she was a large lady crosswise
with an earnest manner and a tendency
toward minding other peoples busi-

ness she had been away at the time
of miss henriettas accident and she
was profuse in her regrets and apolo-
gies

   and of course she wound up
 now that i am back i shall take
charge here dear aunt henrietta and
sec that you have every care and at-
tention

   it isnt necessary said miss hen-
rietta with sharp promptness  eileen
is giving me all the care and attention
i require

   but eileen is so young objected
mrs keith and therefore not very
capable i am sure dear aunt hen-
rietta-

   and you neednt wrent on the un-
moved miss henrietta with a glance
at the glass jar and the covered bowl
mrs keith had placed on the table be-
side the bed  bring me anything more
to eat i have money of my own to
buy the raw material and the way
eileen cooks it suits me very well

  mrs keith gasped she had not
supposed that eileen could cook she
made a few more suggestions all of
which were promptly set aside by miss
henrietta and finally she took her re-
luctant leave

  but two da-s later she came back
she stopped in the living-room below
stairs sat down heavily and folded
her hands over her hand-bag

   it has come to me she said to
eileen  from a source that i cannot
but consider entirely reliable that you
are not getting on very well

  a cold chill wavered up eileens
spine she was in a hard position
and nothing she was doing she very
well knew would meet with her
sisters approval did she know of it
and hortense was such a difficult
person to combat but eileen faced
her defiantly

   i dont know what you mean
she said shortly

   eileen mrs keith said impres-
sively  i know that your gas has been
turned off

   well said eileen  and what if
a course of sprouts



it has theres no sense in having it
on when its not needed

    but it is needed insisted mrs
keith  the gas-range-

   i prefer to cook on the water
heater said eileen  thats run by
coal

  but your lights insisted mrs
keith

   aunt henrietta always uses a
lamp in her room anyway said
eileen  she likes it better than gas
light

  but the rest of the house

  do you suppose said eileen
 we have only one lamp  

  we were told said mrs keith
 that the gas was turned off because
aunt henrietta could not pay her bill
so i have come to offer help

   eileens face flushed

   we do not need help she said
 aunt henrietta can pay that bill and
she will-when she gets good and
ready

   mrs keith got to her feet

    i think she said  i shall have
to see aunt henrietta about the mat-
ter

  she went into the hall but eileen
was quicker than she and at the loot
of the stairs barred the way

    the doctor she stated positively
  has said that aunt henrietta must
 not be worried it makes her temper-
 ature rise you cant see her to-day
 hortense and i think youd better go
 home

  mrs keith tried argument and ex-
postulation but finding both alike use-
less she finally went eileen carefully
locked the door after her and went up-
stairs to her aunt

    i thought miss henrietta greet-
ed her  i heard hortenses voice in
the hall

    probably you did eileen admit-
ted  and mine too she added

   what were you doing  demand-
ed miss henrietta

   putting her out said eileen

 she was butting in

  humph said miss henrietta

 she wouldnt be plortense if she was
not doing that can you keep her
out

  es said eileen determinedly
lean

   miss plenrietta chuckled

    then do it she said

   that night eileen returning just at
dusk from the grocery store on the
corner saw a man and a woman get-
ting out of an auto that had been
stopped before her aunts house

  recognizing them she was devout-
ly thankful that the front door was
securely locked on the inside and that
the back door key was safe in her coat-
pocket she intercepted them at the
front of the porch steps

  well what do you want non
was her chilly greeting

    w e want to come inside for one
thing mrs keith told her

    well you cant eileen said de-
cidedly if you have anything to
say to me ill listen to it right here

  to let them in would have been to
reveal the fact that there really was
only one lamp in the house miss
henrietta had that one

   eileen for the most part went about
in the dark but she had a carefully
hoarded end of tallow candle that
could be pressed into service when
absolutely required she did not how-
ever propose to waste it on mr and
mrs carrington keith

   they looked at her somberly

   we want they said in unison
 to help you

    ive already told you said the
harassed eileen  that i dont want
any help

    thats just your pride said her
sister  im sure you need help

   if my gas had been turned off
said mr carrington keith  id think
i wanted help we have decided
eileen lo pay aunt henriettas gas
bill

    if youre bound to pay it flared
eileen  i suppose i cant stop you
but i can tell you one thing-i wont
let them in to turn on the gas again


all-story weekly

   of course conceded mr keith

  if you wont use the gas thered be

no sense in my paying the bill but i
think eileen we are entitled to an
explanation for either aunt hen-
rietta is short of money and cannot
pay the bill or she can pay and wont
and it is not honest to refuse to pay
your bills when they are due he
stated virtuously

   aunt henrietta affirmed eileen
 has just as much money as ever she
had and shes just as honest as you
are

    but our gas bill she announced
defiantly  is our own affair and
youve no right to come asking ques-
tions about it and ive no time to
stand here any longer talking to you
she ended

  she crossed the snowy yard but at
the corner of the house she turned

    its not a matter of pride with
me she flung at them  its one of
decent self-respect and you neednt
come back again for if you do i wont
let you in

  she disappeared round the house
and they heard the slam of the back
door as it closed after her

   i suppose said mrs keith to
her husband  theres no use in fol-
lowing her

   xone whatever i should say he
told her  weve done all we could
and he piloted his wife to their wait-
ing car and helped her in

  eileen heard them drive off

  then her overstrained nerves gave
way and she began to cry her eyes
were still red when a little later she
carried miss henriettas dinner tray
up-stairs

   youve been crying her sharp-
eyed aunt accused her  whats the
matter 

   hortense brought carrington
here eileen explained  and  told
them if they came back again i
wouldnt let them in

humph said miss henrietta
 and now youre sorry you did it 
 no said eileen with a gulp

 but it makes me mad to think of
all the other things i might have said
and didnt

ill

  the next morning the gas collector

called for the second time on the
occasion of his first visit eileen nerv-
ously almost tearfully apologetic be-
cause of her inability to pay had fair-
ly cringed before him

now her attitude had changed

   that old gas company she
stated distinctly  made more than a
million dollars net last year i know
because i read it in the paper if
they have all that money they can get
along without the little we owe them
a whole lot better than i can get along
without the gas

   im turning black and blue from
hitting myself against the furniture in
the dark and i have to do all the
cooking on the water heater and it
never in this world was built for a
cook stove

  she paused a moment for breath
then hurried on

   were not ready to pay yet she
said  and i dont know when we will
be but when we are well pay at
the office theres no use at all in
your coming here youre just wast-
ing your time

  eileen was angry because in the
gas collector she recognized the  re-
liable source  from whom the keiths
had learned of miss henriettas
turned-off gas and unpaid gas bill

  by the simple expedient of muf-
fling the door-bell every evening
eileen had managed to keep people
out after dark and no one not even
miss henrietta knew that the gas had
been turned off

  but the gas collector knew and
eileen remembered that hortense had
once said with a laugh that she knew
which of her friends kept their gas
bills paid up and which didnt for
carringtons friend the gas collector
told them

  circumstantial evidence was all
a course of sprouts



against the gas collector and eileen
having finished her defiant speech
stood glaring at him and waited to
see what he had to say

  but he merely remarked mildly
that it sometimes did happen that peo-
ple could not pay their bills arid he
guessed the gas company would have
to wait for this one then he grinned
remembering eileens statement con-
cerning the net earnings of the gas
company

   i guess youre right he said
 it wont break em to wait and
he mounted his wheel and rode off

  at their first meeting the gas col-
lector had given considerable more
thought to the bill he was trying to
collect than he had tq eileen now
he remembered her snapping eyes and
flushed cheeks

  gee he said to himself i
didnt think she had it in her i like
em spunky like that

  the next week when he called he
began to talk almost before eileen
had fairly got the door open

   im sorry to keep coming here
and bothering you like this he apol-
ogized  but they keep pretty close
track of the unpaid bills at the office
and they expect me to report on them
about every so often

   im a new broom he explained
with a laugh  and i have to sweep
clean or lose my job maybe wthen
ive worked for em longer- 

   oh interrupted eileen  arent
you the collector theyve had for the
last two years

  he shook his head

  no he told her that man
blatted about who paid their bills and
who did not and they found it out
and fired him ive only had this job
two weeks this was the first place
they sent me to

  eileen stared at him her mind
working rapidly

  just as she had thought the gas
collector had told carrington but it
was not this collector and she had
misjudged him and been rude to him

she began to cast about for a way
of making amends

  her eye fell on his wheel leaning
against the curb

   isnt it she ventured  rather
cold going about on a wheel in the
winter 

   sometimes it is he admitted
 but lie added with his ready laugh
 the gas company doesnt provide its
collector with an auto

   perhaps suggested eileen shyly
 youd like to- come in long enough
to get warm

  the gas collector would and did
he followed eileen to the kitchen for
that she explained was the most com-
fortable room and he pulled off his
thick gloves and stood beside the
water-heater warming his hands

   so yon cook on this  he said

   in it eileen corrected  you
see she explained  the top of it is
so far above the fire that you cant
possibly get it hot enough to cook any-
thing so what i want to cook i put
in a small covered bucket and hang it
on a poker inside the water-heater
 gee  said the gas collector
 howd you ever happen to think of
that

   i had to think of something said
eileen  for of course we couldnt
stop eating just because the gas was
turned off and i couldnt go on cook-
ing on the gas range when you
have to think of things she added
 you can

   well admitted the gas collector
 i never thought of it in just that
way but i suppose youre right

  he stood for a moment in silence
eying eileen reflectively then

   if you think im being nosy he
burst out you can say so and shut
me up but i wish youd put me on to
the combination-tell me what sort of
a circus in three rings youre running
anyway they told me at the office
that i ought to have no trouble at all
in collecting this bill the old lady had
loads of money they said but that
doesnt somehow jibe with cooking in-


all-story weekly

side a water-heater i cant figure it

out

   no one could said eileen
 thats why i cant let any one know
she sighed  do you know how much
things ought to cost she questioned
abruptly

 that depends said the gas col-
lector  some i do and some i dont

   i mean said eileen  things to
eat and coal aud-

   oh living expenses  the gas col-
lector helped her out  well i pay
six dollars a week for my room and
board its not the best board and the
room-

  u i dont mean quite that eileen
interrupted  i mean things before
theyre cooked and coal by the ton
and- w hat i want to know she
added desperately  is how much
money two people really ought to have
to live on for three months

   you see my sisters have been com-
ing to stay with aunt henrietta turn
about three months for each of them
then i came and she gave me the
housekeeping money for three months

   she said it was just what she had
given each of the others and every-
thing must be paid out of it but it
didnt seem enough to me and i tried
to tell her so but that was after her
accident and talking about it made
her temperature rise and the doctor
had said she must not be worried so
i had to give it up and make the money
do whether it was enough or not

  the gas collector looked deeply in-
terested

   how much did she give you   he
questioned in a businesslike way

  eileen told him

  gee he said and then some
id say that was scarcely enough to
buy even the plainest food for two peo-
ple for three months

  a relieved look came over eileens
face

   that was what t thought she
said  and thats why  didnt pay
the gas bill i thought i needed the
money for food

   well i guess you did all right
the gas collector conceded  why
dont you he suggested  speak to
your aunt about it again there must

be a mistake somewhere

  eileen shook her head

    im afraid theres no mistake she
said  aunt henrietta surely knows
what she gave to the girls and what
they bought with it its just i sup-
pose that im not capable like they are
and dont know how to manage but
ill do the best i can and thats all i
can do i can feed us but i cant pay
gas bills

  what do you have to eat de-
manded the gas collector sharply

   aunt henrietta- eileen was be-
ginning but he cut her short

   i didnt ask about her he said
you dont need to tell me that you
somehow squeeze out every last thing
she wants or thinks she wants i want
to know what you have 

  eileen flushed

   mostly cabbage and potatoes
she reluctantly confessed  theyre
cheaper than anything else

   i hate em both  the gas collector
exploded viciously

  he pulled on his gloves with a jerk
and took an abrupt departure eileen
wondering at his sudden change of
manner hoped she had not offended
him

  in half an hour he was back he
came to the back door and he strode
in and placed on the kitchen table a
large bulky paper sack

  look here he said i hope
you wont think im being fresh but
the etiquette books all say a gentleman
may present a lady with fruit and
candy if he wants to i know youre
a lady and i hope im a gentleman
and ive stayed within the limits and
i thought-that is i hoped-well you
know cabbage and potatoes all the
time-

  eileen pulled the sack toward her
and slipped off the string

   id be sorry to think she said
 that  couldnt understand and ap-
a course of sprouts



preciate real kindness when its shown
me and those apples and oranges
and bananas look better to me than
anything i ever saw thank you so
much

  the gas collector beamed with pleas-
ure at her receipt of his gift and took
an oblong box from his pocket

   i was forgetting the candy he
said

  eileen put out her hand and took the
box from him

   but its sixty-cent candy she re-
proached him

    sure it is he said  all the girls
i know think a fellow a cheap skate if
he pays less than that for candy

   its too much said eileen decided-
ly  theres twenty-five-cent candy
in this town thats good enough for
any girl and forty cents is always
enough to pay

  the gas collector stared then he
recovered with a jerk

   say he said with startling frank-
ness  youre my kind all right id
like to get better acquainted with you
what do you do evenings 

  eileen giggled

   muffle the door-bell she told him
so no one can get in and find i have
no light

   but if i came to the back door
the gas collector insisted  and brought
a tailow candle with me 

   tallow candles said eileen de-
murely  are three for a nickel and
three will last a whole evening

iv

   aunt henrietta said eileen
 my three months will not be up for
another week but to-morrow youre
coming down-stairs and youll find
theres a bill to be paid it seemed bet-
ter to tell you to-night

  miss henrietta looked at her sharply

   only one  she said

   yes said eileen  the gas bill
she explained  and we ought to or-
der coal

   then order it instructed miss

henrietta  and pay for it pay the
gas bill too  gave you housekeeping
money for three months she re-
minded

    es said eileen slowly  i know
you did but in no way shape or man-
ner could i make it enough to meet all
the expenses i can buy us food for
the one remaining week but i cannot
pay the gas bill or get coal

   um said miss henrietta then
she began to laugh  im not really
surprised that you cant she said
 eileen i suppose youre not aware
that youve been keeping house on one-
tenth the money rose and margaret
and barbara had 

   eileen stared at her
te one-tenth the money they had  
she gasped  but i thought-you
know you said-

  yes miss henrietta cut in i
know i did and i thought i was tell-
ing tfie truth but eileen i made a
mistake there were two rolls of bills
in my money-box one of them tens and
the other ones

   i meant to give you the tens but
i gave you the ones and never knew
it until this morning when i looked in
my box for the first time since i broke
my hip why child whats the mat-
ter 

  for eileen had turned suddenly and
burying her face in the curve of her
arm was sobbing violently

  miss henrietta readied across and
patted her nieces shoulder

   why there- she said in a voice
curiously unlike her usually sharp one

   eileen lifted her head and achieved
a watery smile

    i guess its nerves she said  i
wasnt expecting such a let-up some
of its been pretty awful aunt hen-
rietta

   all of it i should say corrected
her aunt grimly  child how did you
do it and why 

    i began said eileen  because i
thought i had to but i kept on aunt
henrietta because i wanted to

  her aunt nodded thoughtfully


all-story weekly

   i always thought eileen she
said  that there was good stuff in you
but something out of the ordinary was
required to bring it out and how did
you do it  

   i could buy us food said eileen
 but nothing else that gas bill that
we owe is the first one they sent in

   she smiled a little

    its also the last she said  for i
couldnt pay it and they turned off the
gas

  i never suspected it said miss
henrietta

   no said eileen  you had your
lamp so of course you wouldnt
know

   but you had light of some sort 
insisted miss henrietta

   just a tallow candle said eileen

  but i only lighted that when i was
fixing your tray and had to see

   but you were always afraid of the
dark objected miss henrietta

  yes said eileen i thought j
couldnt even sleep without a light

  she clasped her hands about her
knees and gazed reflectively into the
glowing coals of miss henriettas open
fire

   im not afraid now she said
 and i guess when you are afraid of
a thing the only way to get over it is
to keep going up against it until youre
not afraid any more

   most of us havent the nerve to do
that said miss henrietta

   but if you have to said eileen
 you can it was because of the gas
being turned off she went on  that
i had to fight hortense she found it
out and was determined to interfere

   of course she conceded  it was
all right for her to ask if i needed help
-im sure she meant to be kind-but
when i said  no she should have
stopped there but she wouldnt so
she ended simply  i made her stay
out

  why wouldnt you let her help
demanded miss henrietta abruptly

   hortense doesnt help said ei-
leen  she insists always on running

things her way and her way is not my

way it was my job

   youd given me what you said was
three months housekeeping money and
told me what you expected of me
that made me responsible but be-
cause you were hurt and helpless and
could not see to anything yourself i
was doubly responsible so  just did
the best i could

    think said miss henrietta  no
one could have done better

  praise from miss henrietta was so
rare that it was praise indeed eileen
flushed with surprise and pleasure

   at first she went on glad to talk
it all over with miss henrietta  i was
angry that hortense had found out
about the gas then i began to see it
really didnt matter for if i hadnt
fought her about the gas id have had
to about the fires

   she said the first time she was here
that i wasnt keeping the house warm
enough and of course eileen cheer-
fully admitted  i wasnt for i wasnt
running the furnace at all - just the
water-heater in the kitchen and your
grate up here

   i never knew said miss hen-
rietta  but surely you bought some
coal eileen 

  eileen shook her head

   why i couldntshe said  but
there was already a great deal in the
cellar and i used it as carefully as i
could then when i saw it wasnt
going to last through i kept it for just
stormy days and other days i-

  she stopped flushing

   you what  questioned her aunt
 go on eileen

   i said more than i meant to said
eileen  i hadnt intended to tell
but if you want to know i picked up
coal in the alleys

   you- began miss henrietta
and stopped for words failed her

   you wouldnt think any one would
get much that way said eileen  but
you can its spilt when theyre shov-
eling it from the wagons into the coal-
houses and down coal-chutes and lots
a course oe sprouts



of people just let it lie and never trou-
ble to pick it up i guess aunt hen-
rietta theres more waste in the world
than any one imagines

   yes miss henrietta agreed ab-
sently  i suppose there is

  but it was not of that she was think-
ing rather she was wondering of
what stern stuff was this girl made
that she had done a thing like that
she had not been actuated by the in-
stinct for self-preservation

  that would have sent her hurrying
to the nearest coal-dealer where miss
henriettas name would easily enough
have secured her credit

  rather was there in her something 
better and higher and nobler-that
something that causes men-and wom-
en too-to die for a principle or at the
post of duty and lifts them nearer
god

   i dont know said miss henri-
etta slowly  if any one of your sis-
ters could have done what you have
but i do know that not one of them
would

   but i had to said eileen

  miss henrietta looked at her and a
slow twinkle dawned in her eye

   youve done your part thats cer-
tain she said  now ill begin to do
mine bring me a pencil and a piece
of paper i want to figure what your
wages will amount to

  my wages gasped eileen i
did not know i was to have any

   your sisters had said miss hen-
rietta  the housekeeping allowance
i made them was no miserly one and
i told them that from it i expected
nothing beyond a fairly good table and
the payment of such necessary bills as
came in whatever they could save
they could keep and since a dollar
saved is two dollars earned at the end
of her three months i doubled for each
girl what she had saved

   but- objected eileen

   not so fast warned miss hen-
rietta  a cipher remains always a
cipher whether you multiply it by two
or by twenty-two but though they

saved nothing eileen yet they had
their wages

   that they preferred chocolates
and matinee-tickets and a new hat or
gown rather than a sum of money
saved was their affair and not mine
their wages i figured in my head but
yours i cannot

  if barbara had been with me when
i broke my hip id have gone to the
hospital for flat on my back i could
never have stood barbara so i con-
sider that you saved me hospital ex-
penses

   had margaret been here id have
stayed at home with a trained nurse to
look after me so youve saved me
what i would have paid a nurse rose
could have cared for me and she
would but shed have had in a woman
to do the housework youve saved
me her wages and as you spent only
one-tenth of the money allowed for
household expenses the other nine-
tenths you saved

  as she talked miss henrietta had
set down figures now she added
them up and eileen looking over her
shoulder gave a gasp of wonder

   its a thousand dollars  she said
in an awed voice

   two thousand corrected miss
henrietta  for each dollar of that
thousand is a dollar saved and a dol-
lar saved is tzio dollars earned

   but- expostulated the amazed
eileen

   some people said miss henri-
etta crisply  leave their money for
their relatives to fight over after
theyre dead i prefer to see mine
earned and pay it while im still here
bring me my check-book child its
in my money-box

  eileen stood by silently watching
her aunt fill in the check she went
from red to white and back to red
again when the slip of paper was put
in her hand

   there arent words to thank you
she said earnestly

  for that money meant more to her
than her aunt guessed or imagined


all-story weekly

and zvhy it meant so much was as yet
a secret between eileen and the im-
provident gas-collector who could have
saved his money but hadnt until he
met eileen and so now had enough to
furnish a house or even a little flat
though he could he earnestly assured
eileen support a wife if the wife were
herself and he had a place to put her

  miss henrietta put her check-book
back in the money-box and took out a
roll of bills

   eileen she said  this is the
housekeeping money i meant to give
you and didnt will you take it now
and stay on for another three
months 

  the girls sensitive face quivered
and flushed

   oh she cried  ill be glad to
and i think aunt henrietta its be-
cause ive found myself here  can
do things at last-not big things or
great things of course but-

   child interrupted her aunt  the
big things and the great ones dont al-
ways show so on the surface and
which are big and which are little i
sometimes thing only god himself
can rightly judge

  from the direction of the back door
came the sound of one knocking and
eileen started to her feet

   its - the gas-collector she fal-
tered

   the nerve of him flared miss
henrietta  coming at this time of
night but youve the money now

xj	u

eileen pay him and send him about

his business

   but he doesnt come officially any
more aunt henrietta eileen ex-
plained in some confusion he
comes to see me and his name is
jones

   humph said miss henrietta
not much of a name according to
my thinking

   he has another defended eileen
 its fordham-

   well conceded miss henrietta
 his mother evidently tried to do
what she could to improve mat-
ters but i cant say i think she
altogether succeeded plain john
or henry would have been much
better however she handsomely
admitted  hes not to blame for either
jones or fordham go and let him in
eileen and bring him up ill look
him over

  eileen went down-stairs but before
ever she reached the kitchen the listen-
ing miss henrietta heard the back
door open and close again

  evidently the gas-collector whose
name was jones was well accustomed
to that place and very sure of his wel-
come miss henrietta thought she
understood and like the sensible wom-
an she was she accepted the inevitable

   if i like his looks she decided
 half as well as i do eileens house-
keeping ill ask them to live here for
i guess if we both tried he and i could
get used to each other in time

the contradiction

 by amanda benjamin hall

      the women he had loved before
      had made him promise oer and oer
      he would be true till both were dead

          then love had fled

       but when one came with rainbow smile
       who kissed him saying all the while
       tis sweet because it cannot last

          love staved steadfast
by paul west

t efore i tell this story i
want one thing thoroughly
 understood im not look-
jldrj ing for sympathy i dont
ffigal want and i dont expect
anybody to say poor fel-
low it was a shame 

  it wasnt a shame all that i got
was coming to me plainly directed
and prepaid i deserved it maybe
more now that i look back i think
i got off pretty lightly at all events
im not complaining

  this being settled en avont as we
say in france

  i must have been the most uncon-
scionably fresh thing that ever needed
salting of course i didnt think i
was at the time being spoiled by my
last two years in college where they
had made a sort of idol of me ever
since the day i won the middle-weight
championship by whipping all comers

  after that they began to puff me up
and like an idiot i allowed the adula-
tion to turn my head

  i was husky-very and if i do say
it i could box i liked the sport and
 was always at it pat donoghue
our boxing instructor said he had
never seen a college man anywhere
near my class

he used to bring some of the best



professionals down to put on the
gloves with me im not bragging
when i say there wasnt one of them
who could do much to me they all
had to admit that and they all agreed
with pat that in going in for the law
i was absolutely ruining what couldnt
have helped being a great career in the
ring

  but while all this praise made me
horribly conceited i wasnt quite fool
enough to consider seriously any
proposition to become a prize-fighter
so when i graduated i left poor old
pat and his plug-ugly friends mourn-
ing my loss to the ring

  the family all thought i had
worked so hard to get my degree that
i ought to have a good long rest that
summer i thought so myself so
when garravan haddaway and about
twenty others who were going into
camp in the adirondacks asked me to
come along i gladly accepted

  they were overjoyed my presence
-the presence of the intercollegiate
middle - weight champion boxer -
would add tone to any camp fliey
thought i guess maybe i thought so
too

  from the very start as i can see
now i began to cook up my fate it
was entirely unintentional on my part-


all-story weekly

i didnt mean to be conceited or over-
bearing

  i suppose it was my great strength
that made me always squaring off to
other fellows hitting them playful lit-
tle taps-not so soft im afraid the
way the weaker ones used to wince
under them-and generally showing
my companions what a big muscular
person i was

  and i was always posing around in
a short-sleeved shirt-or it must have
seemed posing to the others-getting
tanned up till my muscular frame
looked- like a piece of modeling in
bronze

  but nobody called me down for it
all being a little afraid of me i sup-
pose though i know now of course
that they noticed it and poked fun at
me behind my back it was more than
fun too some of the boys began to
get a little jealous at the way i at-
tracted the girls

  this is not conceit please under-
stand me i was a good-looking chap
and it didnt take me long to find that
masculine strength made an awful hit
with the other sex so of course i
worked it for all it was worth

  how i doted on showing those
bulging biceps of mine as i wielded a
paddle before the admiring eyes of
some pretty girl from one of the cot-
tages near our camp and how well
i knew that as i stood poised on the
spring-board for a dive into the lake
more than one smitten maiden was ob-
serving my herculean proportions
from the piazza of the lodge

  for this camp of ours was not in the
wilderness but on the edge of one of
those fashionable summer settlements
in which the adirondacks abound and
there were plenty of people to nurture
the admiration in which i was begin-
ning to hold myself so highly

  poor fool that i was ah well
 those whom the gods would de-
stroy and so on

  along came vickery the first
morning i saw him i failed to size
him up for what lie was i looked 

him only as an unusually fresh boun-
der for daring to take millicent peters
canoeing when it was generally known
along the lake that she was one of my
particular conquests if not the one

  almost ever morning about this
hour for a week  had been hopping
into my canoe-in white flannels with
a sleeveless silk shirt that showed my
arm-and-shoulder muscles to the best
advantage-and running up the shore
to the landing in front of the lodge
to take millicent for a ride

  why at the very moment when
vickerys canoe hove in sight with
vickery doing the paddling and milli-
cent propped against the cushions in
the stern i was just about to get into
my own to go after her

  i stepped back on the dock scarce-
ly believing my eyes as vickery pad-
died the canoe alongside at millicents
request

   hello mr kneeland she called
 ive brought somebody down you
ought to know mr vickery mr
kneeland mr vickerys just come
up to the lodge for the summer
youve heard me speak of mr knee-
land-hes the college champion boxer
you know 

   glad to meet you said vickery
reaching up to the float

  i stooped down to grasp his hand
after holding millicents a moment
i would have liked to yank him out of
the canoe and dump him in the lake in
his dark-blue serge suit but i thought
i could attend to all that later

  vickery didnt look as if he would
be much trouble giving no great ap-
pearance of unusual huskiness i
rather put him aside and addressed
myself to millicent after a formal
greeting to him he sat quietly in the
canoe as she and  chatted

  even when they went back to the
lodge after inviting me up to play
tennis in the afternoon  somewhat
pitied vickery as i thought i noticed
an admiring light in his eyes when he
looked in millicents direction

  poor fellow so he had already
a scrap in the dark



lost his heart to her oh well another
fly for me to brush aside

  that afternoon i went up to the
lodge and as vickery came down to
the court ready for a set of doubles-
he and some other girl were going to
play millicent and me-i had a slight
shock

  he like me wore a silk shirt
sleeveless and for the first time i saw
that he was about as husky an indi-
vidual as myself his muscles were
big and developed and his shoulders
were wonders while his neck was
short and corded

  his face too bore all the marks of
a man in good training and his gen-
eral action as he got into the game
told me that i was up against an ath-
lete like myself i wondered if he
were a boxer and at the first chance i
asked him

   oh a little he said  ive done
quite a little at college but i wouldnt
care to call myself much of a terror
with the gloves especially when
youre around

   im not so sure about that said

i	laughing but thinking to myself

   im on to this boy hes some-
body and hes trying to lead me on 

  that night i found out more about
vickery i learned that i was right
in my estimate of his prowess tt was
haddaway who tipped me off as we
lay around the camp-fire waiting to go
to sleep

   vickery  he said if its tom
vickery hes one of the crack west-
ern college middle-weights michigan
i think

  then i remembered an m on vick-
erys tennis-cap and knew that this
was the man ah well maybe it
would be a little more work to teach
him his place than i had at first ex-
pected but i guessed i was equal to
the emergency

  i didnt want to pick any trouble
with him though not that i was
afraid of him for i give you my word
i was not i had whipped many men
who looked a good deal tougher than

he was and when it came to the ques-
tion of skill i hadnt any doubt that
any advantage on that score was on
my side

  but almost from the first i could
see that trouble was coming vickery
began to establish a proprietorship
over millicent peters that was galling
to me and when i stepped in and put
a stop to it you could see he didnt
like it a bit and one day when a
canoe-trip was organized by a crowd
along the lake and i kidnaped milli-
cent for my canoe-mate just when i
could see he thought he had it all
fixed i imagined for a moment that
vickery was going to start the row
right then and there and have it out
with me well id have been willing
i think

  anyway from that time on i kept
my eye peeled for war and in no
half-measured way i showed mr
vickery from day to day that i
wasnt going to stand any fooling
ill even admit that the chip which
each of us carried around on his shoul-
der became apparent to the rest of the
crowd

all-story weekly

  so here goes

  it was just as kneeland said every-
body soon discovered that he and
vickery had a chip on the shoulder
and were looking for trouble at
first we looked on the whole matter as
 joke but alter a while it got tedious
and bothersome because we couldnt
go anywhere without the enmity of the
two spoiling things

  our crowd and the lodge crowd
began to grow rather chummy during
the summer-nice fellows tip at the
lodge and a lot of bully girls so we
had them over at camp carefree for
little picnics and dances and things
and they returned the compliment

  but instead of these little games be-
ing good fun as they should have
been they commenced to be the bane
of our young lives because vickery
and kneeland spoiled them

  it wasnt only over the peters girl
though goodness knows every time the
two came within three feet of each
other and she was anywhere around
we all thought wed soon have to
throw red pepper in their eyes to pry
them apart

  no the two clashed everywhere
and at last it came to a point where
we either had to be on the watch all
the time or thered have been murder

  look here garrv said had-
dawav to me one day  theres go-
ing to be murder up in these diggings
pretty soon

  over wrat i asked

   vickery and kneeland we cant
keep em apart much longer honestly
every time theyre on the same side of
the lake i look for a battle to the
death just now for instance vickery
came up to the float in his canoe and
kneeland was standing there and
wouldnt move an inch

   i saw vickery push his way back
of kneeland and i give you my word
if he had brushed the tip of the nap
on kneelands sweater hed have gone
overboard kneelands fist wras dou-
bled up like a ham at the end of a
catapult

   and vickery i suppose wasnt

looking for anything 

   oh not at all he was not only
looking but begging for it i tell
you theyre spoiling the whole sum-
mer millicent peters says she wont
go up the lake with the party were
getting up next saturday if either
vickery or kneeland goes along she
thinks there  be a tragedy before
they get back and she doesnt want
her name in the papers as the bone of
contention

  its a darned shame said i
 but t dont see what i can do un-
less-

  unless what talking to either
of them wont do any good

   unless i said an idea flashing
through my head  they get together
before saturday and fight it out

   they wouldnt do it said had-
daway  its my candid opinion that
kneeland for all his record and fine
opinion he has of himself is a little
afraid of vickery and i dont im-
agine vickery is dying to try knee-
land out either

    theyre like a couple of dogs that
growl at each other across a fence
if the gate were opened theyd prob-
ably both run

   i doubt that said i  i think
kneeland could kill vickery hes
considerably heavier

   but vicks like a bundle of whip-
cords id like to see them together
i f we could only fix it somehow

  we mentioned our idea to millicent
peters who we ran across that eve-
ning she was hiding from both
vickery and kneeland who were
looking for her to take her canoeing
in the moonlight

   oh i think any such plan is per-
fectly brutal she exclaimed in hor-
ror you are all dreadful

   but its the only way said had-
daway  you cant have two cocks
of the walk ones got to whip the
other and have it over with so the
question of masterys decided once and
for all
a scrap in the dark



   yes said millicent and which-
ever one was whipped would pack up
and go home and leave the other and
that wouldnt do because theyre both
such charming fellows and charm-
ing fellows are very scarce up here 
 oh  said we understanding her
and went away

  but five minutes later wre decided
that our plan must be followed out
after all it was just as we were leav-
ing the lodge suddenly down on the
lawn near the lake there broke out a
noise like the falling of a sky-scraper
and we got there just in time to keep
kneeland who had bumped into vick-
ery from chucking vickery clear
across the lake-or vice versa

  we dragged kneeland down to our
camp and sent vickery up to the
lodge under a strong escort and that
night we planned it all out

  we put it to vickery and kneeland
next morning-that is we put part of
it to them-not all there was one
little portion we reserved for our-
selves-the secret part

   you and vickery are spoiling
everybodys summer we told knee-
land  youre on the verge of a bat-
tle all the time everybodys afraid
to go anywhere because they think its
liable to break out any moment

   now the only way to get this
thing over is for you two fellows to
fight it out vickery thinks he can
put it all over you hes been around
bragging that youre afraid of him
you feel a little the same way about
him and we hope and believe thor-
oughly youre right

   but its got to be settled and
heres our arrangement you and he
are to fight a duel but a different sort
of a duel from most of them youre
going to fight blindfolded

  blindfolded shouted kneeland
 not on your li fe 

   oh yes you are said we  its
millicent peterss idea we think we
know why shes a little afraid you
can lick vickery too easily anti she
doesnt want him marked up too much

iot that she really cares more for him
than she does for you but shes sym-
pathetic and favors the under dog
she thinks that if youre blindfolded
you wont be able to hit him so hard
and so often and-

    once will be enough grunted
kneeland  whens the duel coming
off

  we told practically the same things
to vickery and he also fell for our
plan when we mentioned why milli-
cent wanted the blindfolds on her two
heroes

  he said he could lick kneeland
blindfolded and if it would please
millicent at all we would tie one of
his hands behind his back but we
said no we only wanted the blind-
folds on and the duel would take
place in b camp which was a good
big room that night

  and promptly at eight oclock vick-
ery landed at our float with his canoe
and two seconds charley deane and
jack peters millicents brother he
was introduced to kneeland who had
haddaway and me to look after him
and then the arrangements were laid
before them

  i will now surrender as narrator in
favor of mr kneeland himself

narrative continued by edward

  kneeland former intercolle-
  giate middle-weight champion

   gentlemen said garry who
did most of the talking  it is unnec-
essary to rehearse the reasons for the
coming combat or why it is to be
fought as we have arranged further
details are few b camp has been
stripped for the fray-all the furniture
taken out as you will see when you
are admitted

   you will be taken in there the
gloves - two ounces - adjusted and
the blindfolds put over your eyes
mr kneelands seconds will put mr
vickerys on and mr vickerys


all-story weekly

friends will perform a similar duty

for mr kneeland

   you w ill then be left to fight it
out behind locked doors at the end
of ten minutes the doors will be un-
locked the blindfolds removed from
your eyes and the winner declared

  that there will be a winner we
sincerely trust and believe that the
fight will be fair we have no doubt
relying on each combatants honor to
strike no foul blows or to remove his
blindfold

  gentlemen are you ready

   we are we said

  then garry and the other three
seconds took us inside of b camp
which as he had said was stripped
clean-not a chair or a table or a
hammock left inside no hiding-place

  we stripped and though it wasnt
the first time i had seen vickery in
the buff i was seized with strong ad-
miration for his appearance but i
wasnt a bit scared of him then they
put on the gloves-pretty nearly skin-
gloves too-as you know two ounces
isnt much

  then peters and deane put on my
blindfold doing a thorough job all
right

  first they slipped a baglike thing
of black silk down over my head and
tied it securely under my chin and
then over that they put another strip
across my eyes tying that tightly at
the back of my head

  see i couldnt see the inside of
my own eyelids 

  garravan and haddaway were at-
tending to vickery at the same time-
doing a thorough job too for i
heard him exclaim in a muffled way

   ouch  not so tight over the right
eye there im a little tender-boxing
a bit this morning 

   youll be tenderer  thought i to
myself

  finally they had us both ready
deane and peters stepped away from
me

   all-fixed  i heard garravan ask

   all fixed replied millicents

brother  do you care to examine

his blindfold

   not unless you want to look over

v	ickervs said haddaway there
was a moments silence while i stood
there like a dummy wondering what
was coming next

   everything being arranged said
garravan  i suppose we may as well
let them start how about the lamp
do we need to leave it in here

   i dont see how a light can be of
any advantage to them under the cir-
cumstances said deane  and they
might knock it over

  all right said garravan i
guess wed better take it out with us

   now gentlemen he added  lets
get down to business your hand
kneeland 

  he took my right and i felt him
place it in vickerys holding them to-
gether with both of his

   you understand the rules of this
-er-affair of honor he said  ten
minutes its to last you can arrange
the rounds to suit your convenience
at the end of ten minutes we will un-
lock the doors and present ourselves
to you till then matters are in your
hands are you ready  

   i am said i

   i am said vickery

   then said garravan  when
you receive the signal you will begin
but not till then gentlemen-deane
haddaway peters are you ready
 yes answered haddaway from
the direction i remembered the door
to lie in  come  garravan got
the lamp deane

   got everything

   wait for the signal said garra-
van pressing my hand into vickerys
and releasing his grasp on our wrists

  then he walked rapidly toward the
door

   wait  he said

  there was a scuffling of feet the
door slammed to and was locked and
from outside came garravans voice
 go

  we were alone the battle was on
a scrap in the dark

  not till that moment did i realize
the peculiar conditions of the light
not till we were left alone in that big
room facing- each other in the dark
did i entirely comprehend what i had
agreed to somehow while garravan
remained holding our hands i could
see-or at least could sense-my sur-
roundings but with his withdrawal
and the withdrawal of the other three
seconds from the room there came a
feeling of helplessness that i cant
describe

  i felt lost like a ship without a rud-
der i almost forgot that facing me
in precisely the same predicament
was vickery and that he and i were
there to fight each other

  then suddenly i heard a slight sound
like that of a foot being moved ten-
tatively on the bare floor it brought
me to my senses it was vickery
setting himself for the first punch
which he meant to make a good one
before i should have any chance to
elude him in the stygian darkness

  two can play at that game
flashed through my mind

  i drew back my minds eye if not
my physical optic fixed on the point
of vickerys chin which must be
within striking distance i let fly-a
straight full - forced right - arm jab
with all the weight of my body be-
hind it

  it landed-on the air

  but at that same instant vickerys
blow which must have leen a coun-
terpart of my own was launched and
i felt the heel of his hand come crash-
ing against my left cheek it was a
glancing blow and that was all that
saved me for it was a crusher deliv-
ered with all the force he could put
into it-i could tell that by the grunt
with which he accompanied it-and if

v	ickerys punch had landed fair on
my jaw it might have finished me then
and there

  so t had been none too quick for
my foxy opponent

  almost before the thud of his fist
had lost its force i side-stepped quick-



ly so as to forestall a second jab of
the same sort should he try it as i
side-stepped i took a step forward and
let go at him with my right again
but this time in a swing to catch him
on the side of the face if he were still
there

  this time i landed - landed good
and hard - and i heard him grunt
but before i could follow it with an
uppercut from my left somehow he
crossed me it was wonderfully
quick wonderfully well measured and
it took me flush on the mouth

  oh what a crusher behind my
impenetrable blindfold i saw stars -
all the stars in the world-and whats
more they were red stars for now i
was mad clear through

  i let fly at vickery i missed i
followed up and drove again at him
- wide swings first with my left
then my right

  they swished through the air but
they met nothing i began to think i
was fighting away from him when
whack it was my left ear this time
that got it - got it with a ringing
palm-open slap that made my brains
ring and buzz

  i was maddened not so much with
the force of the blows already landed
on me as at the thought that vickery
could get me almost at will while i
could not find him

  i stopped crouching nursing my
smarts listening

  then i heard him behind me creep-
ing stealthily mouselike i turned on
my toes and let fly where i could hear
his sharp quick breathing before
my blow had finished the arc in which
i swung my fist crash again that
smash on the month and swash
again that echo - awakening slap on
my ear-my right ear this time

  i swung wildly leaping forward
once or twice as i rained a shower
of blows in all directions i landed
though not effectually but neither
did vickery i was making him cover
and give ground anyway which was
some satisfaction


all-story weekly

  i pressed on with a wilder swing
than ever but i hit nothing more a
sound like a quick tread to one side
gave me a hint that he had side-
stepped me i leaped away fearing a
flank attack but i was too late

 bang bang not one but two
staggering blows landed on my neck
just below the ear-a trifle higher and
i should have been a goner

  i followed their direction i fought
into them-and suddenly i landed

  oh yes i landed-hard i thought
ray hand was broken for it was the
wall i had struck sending my knuckles
crashing against the rough pine and
as if that were not enough from fully
ten feet away i heard a mocking
laugh

  is that so i roared now fairly
beside myself with rage  look out
now youll get it good and plenty
this time 

 smack something landed on my
eye smash something else met my
nose with terrific impact

  and then for the first time i knew
what it was to actually fear an adver-
sary his uncanny success in hitting
me and getting away again made me
drop to the floor holding my breath
coming nearer than ever before in my
life to wishing the fight were over

  sut almost before i had crouched
down to my utmost my budding ter-
ror gave way to a desire for revenge
it was utterly impossible that vick-
ery blindfolded as i was-and of the
tightness of his bandage i had no
doubts - could see any better than i
could

  it must have been luck or a skilful
way of fighting-waiting for me lis-
tening to my footsteps and locating
me by the sound i would do the
same thing i too would be cautious

  i rose slowly to my feet listening
scarcely daring to breathe lest i should
shut out the sound of his slightest
movement

  all was still nothing but the beat-
ing of my heart alarmed the night
yet t listened until at last  thought

i could hear the slightest sort of noise
-perhaps breathing perhaps move-
ment-to my left

  slowly cautiously hardly daring to
move a foot for fear it would be
heard i began to creep in that direc-
tion

  crash this time it was another of
those glancing blows on the side of
my face crash another on the
opposite cheek with the second one
i turned one loose with everything i
had behind it nothing suffered but
the air

  i stood still gasping not from loss
of breath but in astonishment how
could he do it where was he well
let him come on now if he had me
located he could not be far away
next time i too would-

  crack my left ear rang i leaped
fully five feet to the right stnack
on the side of my nose - the right
side i danced backward bringing up
my guard

  blam an uppercut from under-
neath my guard jarring my teeth but
jarring a thousand times more my
state of mind where was vickery
how did he do it how-

  crash full in the space between
my eyes i went down i wont ad-
mit it was entirely from the blow i
dropped willingly and i stayed down

  afraid to get up well yes ill
admit it and if you laugh at me and
call me a quitter all i have to say is
let them put you in a dark room with
another man both blindfolded and let
him hit you as often and as hard as
he pleases when you cant find him to
save your life and see if you arent
afraid too

  yes i was afraid i lay crouching
there gasping my hands resting on
the floor ready to spring if that fist
should find me again but not knowing
which way to jump

  it was very still not a breath
could be heard but my own and  took
scarcely enough into my lungs to keep
them bellowsed lest the sound of it
should tell vickery where i was
a scrap in the dark



  i even crawled along the floor like
a whipped dog he must not find me
-not unless  could find him too

  then i realized what a coward i
was i rose slowly and began feeling
along the wall till i came to the locked
door it was almost in my mind to
draw the bolt and leap outside to get
away from this uncanny adversary
but i shook off the desire and stepped
out into the center of the room

  if he were there i had another plan
now i would let him strike me and
would wait but when the second one
came i would clinch and then-

  oh i didnt care if it was against
the rules or not once i got hold of
him there would be no rules no any-
thing but revenge with teeth
clenched i waited i waited but not
long

  crash i took the blow and got
ready my hands half lifted not for
a blow but to grab the arm next time
it came at me

  blam back of my ear

  i whirled with gritting teeth and
pawed at the air to clutch him by
throat or arm-by anything

  crash behind my ear again but
now from the other direction now
i wildly madly covered and sank to
the floor-whipped 

  and then suddenly i heard the bolts
of the door being drawn and the
sound of voices-

  ten minutes up

  with the horrid thought that they
would find me cowering-punished-
licked-i leaped to my feet and stood
in a fighting position there came
the rush of feet my blindfold was
torn off and there two feet from
me in the same position as that which
i was holding stood vickery

  i was ashamed to look at him-t
with my lips puffed my eyes one
completely closed the other only a
slit through which  could see but
dimly my nose swollen my chin and
cheeks scraped and bulging while
he i knew was practically unscathed

  then suddenly through my half-

closed eye i saw what i did not be-
lieve

  vickery was a sight if my eyes
were bad his were shocking his up-
per lip was puffed out so that you
could have hung a towel on it his
nose was twice its natural size his
whole countenance seemed so dis-
torted that i hardly knew him but
through his bloated features he was
staring at me as i would have stared
at a superman awe admiration com-
plete worship in his maudlin glance

  i looked from this sight the mean-
ing of which i could not fathom to
our seconds for an explanation

  i looked in vain i thought i saw
the retreating form of garravan go-
ing through the door and so did
vickery but we were too slow for
the little rabbit and all we could do
was look out after the scurrying
quartet into the dark of the woods
and curse them-for what we did
not know exactly

  then we turned back into the big
room and looked at each other stand-
ing under the lamp which they had
had the decency to replace before mak-
ing their exit

  my lord kneeland gasped he
whats happened to you youre
a sight 

  whats happened to me i
flashed back  whats happened
you ask that after what you did to
me 

   i  he gasped  i what are
you talking about i never landed
on you once while you simply had
me whanging all over the place look
what youve done to mv face 

    i 

  it was my turn to gasp

   i why vick i never laid a
glove on you through the whole
thing 

  you didnt then who-

  i think it came to us simultaneously

i know that vickery was no quicker
than i in spying those four pairs of
two-ounce gloves that somebody had
hurriedly thrown on the floor i

know he saw no sooner than i did
what it all had meant and i know
we both looked pretty well ashamed
as we shook hands

   and there were four of them in
the room all the time whanging us
any way they wanted to said he
four of them just think of it

and  thought it was you will we
kill them for it

 we ought to said i  but
somehow vick i think wed do bet-

maybe we brought it on ourselves

the master-dead

     by djuna chappell barnes

        his sighs were sonnets out of school

        he made replies
             like any wise artistic fool
             with gabled eyes

         lie told his truths as men have done
          since men knew lies

         he was alone the master grain
          in all the crowd

        a thousand hammers on his heart
          beat high and loud

         aye its a wasted field indeed

         untilled unplowed

         his sense of tolerance was marred
          by inborn leers

         his eyes the fountain-springs of life
           half warped with tears

        some said that he had wept too much
          throughout the years

         and so he gambled at lifes hoard
          breath has its price  

         a prisons built with iron bars

        a man with dice

         a kitten is a king because
         it knows its mice

         and so he died yet lying dead
          was incomplete

         for though his head laughed loud in hell
           the shuddring wheat

         in gods stern granaries was stirred
           by his great feet

         though half of him irreverence

         and half retrieves

         his chest he left beneath our sod
           and leaves

        and in the dawn when god is still-

            it heaves
