a sequel to the moon conquerors

  foreword

 r h romans

in the early summer of  the entire earth was
startled by the unannounced arrival of a space flyer
from another world but it was soon learned that
the visitors were here on a mission of peace they had
brought to their native land three
of the five moon conquerors
who ten years earlier had made
a voyage to the moon in the first
earth-made space flyer the astro-
naut dr wm h haverfield
and his companions had long ago
been given up as dead it was a
pleasant surprise to learn that
they were returning safe and
sound

  but a greater surprise cume
when their story was given to
the public and it was learned
that the moon was not a dead
world as commonly believed but
the home of a race of scientific
people carrying on an existence
that was highly artificial

   soon after his arrival dr hav-
erfield prqared a manuscript tell-
ing much of the histpry
of the selenites he
showed that their race
and our own had colti-
mon ancestors they
were separated about
 years ago at
the time of the great-
est catastrophe in
human history the
destruction before
that time our earth
was a member of an-
other solar system as
the two solar systems
approached and passed
each other two plan-
ets one of each sys-
tem threatened to
meet in a titanic crash
and annihilate a 
forms of life on both
worlds one of these
planets was the moon
and the other was our
own earth

   in dr haverfields
interplanetary h i s-
tory he told of the
forces of naturswhich
came to the aid of
humanity and averted
the crash by the nar-
rowest of margins but
wrought havoc on both worlds the superior force of
gravity of the larger body the earth produced enormous
tides on the smaller the moon as the worlds came
closer together all the lunar seas were drawn from their
beds all loose objects were swept up from the surface

in this tidal wave and together with the lunar atmosphere
were drawn to the larger body robbing the moon of all
means of sustaining life

   dr haverfield described the conditions of the human
                       race at this time there were
                       two races the black masters
                       known as the vuduites and the
                       white race of slaves this con-
                       dition had existed for over two
                       hundred thousand years ever
                       since the vuduites had risen
                       from savagery to supremacy on
                       the lost planet which once exist-
                       ed between the orbits of mars
                       and jupiter the blacks had
                       eventually developed a great and
                       scientific civilization while the
                       struggling whites continued as
                       illiterate and rebellious slaves
                       centuries after the moon had
                       been colonized by the blacks and
                       their slaves a catastrophe oc-
                       curred which destroyed the old
                       world and vudu supremacy at
                       the same time

   at about the time

 to those of our readers who read the mar-
 velous moon conquerors in the winter
  issue and those who delight in fascinat-
 ing interplanetary adventures the present sequel
 is enthusiastically presented mr romans peers
 into the recesses of history finds much that is
 puzzling and unexplained alike to the man on the
 street and the historian and tears aside the veil
 of mystery to show us tremendous dramas that
 may have taken place in the conflicts of great
 worlds nowhere does our author leave the
 bounds of possibility and yet from the materials
 that he has he constructs breath-taking adven-
 tures that carry one on irresistibly from chapter
 to chapter

   it is all too true that there is little that we
 know of what has taken place or is taking place
 on the planets of our little solar system every-
 one has his own thoughts about the possible races
 of people that may exist on the eight solar planets
 can they be like us have they had the same
 history are they equal to us in intelligence
 are they likely to come here to destroy us these
 questions though unimportant at present are
 filled with such interesting possibilities that any
 number of fascinating stories can be constructed
 around them but one will have to go far to equal
 a story such as our author has given us in the
 following pages

of the destruction a
small portion of the
white race entered the
most desirable of the
underground caverns
of the moon and en-
closed themselves be-
hind air-tight doors
they were led by
zerko a man of
science who is now
regarded by the sele-
nites as the savior of
his world being a
student of the sciences
of the black race as
well as those of his
own he understood the
transmutation of the
elements and taught
his people to produce
synthetic food as well
as an invisible syn-
thetic atmosphere
which was permitted
to escape from the
caves and replace the
air that had been stolen
by the larger planet

   in dr haverfields
former manuscript he
gave a short history
of the moon after tlie
destruction and told of the scientific progress the
selenites had made in his present manuscript lie gives
the world a short story of its first human inhabitants
which in several respects is more interesting and spec-
tacular than his former efforts
	wonder stories quarterly

  the downfall of a great race
  the second manuscript of dr wm h haverfield am phd

chapter i	restrial food was more desirable than their own synthetic

strangers in a strange land

six months have now passed since the first part of
the interplanetary history has been published
those months have been one of the busiest periods
of my life the commerce between the two worlds has
demanded my personal attention and as an ambassador
from the moon i have had more affairs of state to
handle than any foreign diplomat at washington the
selection of one thousand young men to be sent to the
moon to study the sciences and arts of that world and
later return to teach our people has been a very dif-
ficult task particularly so since a constant lookout must
be maintained to avoid a class of adventurers who hope
to exploit the selenites for their personal fortunes

  geographical and scientific societies seem to have the
impression that i have plenty of time for touring the
country and giving lectures before their groups editors
of scientific publications have tried to persuade me to
drop everything and fill their pages with articles at five
dollars per word and the public seems to think my
entire time should be spent in shaking hands and attend-
ing celebrations in our honor popularity has its penal-
ties and fame has its disadvantages the gentlemeii
of the press have denied me all privacy it seems that
every half grapefruit i eat is sure to be mentioned in
the headlines the same morning

  but the universal news syndicate whose newspapers
throughout the country were the first to publish my
former narrative have been very patient and kind they
seem to appreciate the fact that i can not do everything
at once and i believe their patience should be rewarded
consequently i am neglecting my other duties for one
day in which to prepare the manuscript i promised six
months ago i had hoped to spare myself this task but
for reasons that will appear later i could not do it i
now have a microphone before me into which i am re-
lating this story the microphone is connected to two
improved ediphones in another room as soon as i
have dictated enough to fill one record an assistant
throws a switch which stops one machine and starts the
other to recording my words while the second record
is being filled the first is sent to a typist who puts the
story on paper and a third record is made ready to start
as soon as the second is filled in this manner i can de-
vote my entire attention to the story knowing that it
will be ready to read as soon as i have finished

  it will be remembered that in my former manuscript
i spoke of third dimensional motion pictures in both
sound and color which are used in teaching history in
the selenite colleges i had hoped to be able to bring
these pictures to the earth and let our people learn the
story as i learned it by seeing the pictures of the events
as they happened but due to a peculiar characteristic
of the selenites this is impossible they live much
longer and much slower than we do in a lifetime of
one thousand years ten of our years is considered a
very short time when our people decide to do a thing
they are not long about doing it but the selenites like to
take their time the only time i ever saw any of them
get in a hurry was the time they discovered that ter-

   see the moon cbnquerors by r h romans winter  issue
science wonder quarterly

diet their appetites stimulated their activities and that
is the only reason that commerce has flourished between
the tw worlds and the price of foodstuffs has advanced
so rapidly during the past three months

  but as for sending these pictures to our world they
say that due to the fact that we have no laboratories
equipped for duplicating pictures of that kind in quan-
tities sufficient for our use the work must be done in
their world they think it encouraging when they say
the pictures will be ready for us in about ten years
they can not realize that within ten years a large por-
tion of our population will have passed away and their
places filled by others

  that makes it necessary at this time to present the
story from the printed page you readers will no doubt
give it your undivided attention but your imaginations
can not possibly conjure a complete vision of the scenes
as i realize only too well that my meager description can
not do them justice

the first maps of the earth

it was  years after the destruction or about
 years ago that the selenites learned the secret
of controlling gravity and using it as a means of as-
tronautical transportation previous tothat time they
had their hands full in preparing their own world for
comfortable habitation consequently little interest was
shown in the giant neighbor world the earth which they
considered uninhabitable because of its force of gravity
which was six times as great as that to which they had
been accustomed but thinking that their ancient
enemies the vuduites had probably succeeded in over-
coming these adverse conditions and thus established a
few colonies the reigning zerko of dunel authorized
a complete exploration of barlenkoz

  the first exploring expedition was composed of a fleet
of twenty spherical space flyers equipped with all
weapons of defense known to their world at that time
they were instructed to use their weapons only for their
defense because the reigning zerko and his supreme
council could see that unpleasant interplanetary dif-
ficulties would arise should the planet prove to be al-
ready inhabited by intelligent beings of any form and
an unwarranted attack were made by the inhabitants of
another world

  it will be remembered that heretofore astronautics was
an unknown science to them in the past all secrets of
this kind were carefully guarded by the vuduites who
saw that with little encouragement their white slaves
were capable of mastering any of their sciences con-
sequently after the selenites had learned to control
gravity they had to learn all the problems of space fly-
ing for themselves for many centuries their scientists
had told them of the dangers and problems that would be
encountered but it remained for the first pioneers of as-
tronautics to learn the secrets for themselves

  the expedition met with no mishaps as they left their
own world no time will be taken in describing their
experiences as they journeyed across the  miles
of cold empty space photographs were taken of the
giant world as an aid in learning its physical character-

king of the moon

barlenkoz is the selenite word for a great danger or the big
menace  since the earth has always terrorized them it is named
barlenkoz
the war of the planets



istics and mapping it before the task of exploration
started these photographs are hard to identify with
the maps of our world as we know it today the con-
tinent of south america presented almost the same fea-
tures as it does today but in the amazon valley a huge
lake or sea is shown since this does not appear on
photographs of that region taken at a later date it is
believed that this sea was nothing but a flooded condition
of the amazon valley atlantis appears as a continent
about the size of australia almost connecting the coast
of brazil with that of africa and extending as far north
as the azores the west indies are part of the pen-
insula of florida alaska and asia are connected by

continent of asia the british isles are not only a part
of the european continent but that continent extends to
iceland

  the eastern hemisphere is but one vast undivided
continent comprising europe asia and africa in the
region now occupied by the sahara desert there is a large
inland sea which has no outlet to either the atlantic nor
indian ocean north of this body of water which for
want of a better name i shall call the sahara sea four
smaller inland seas were to be found the largest oc-
cupied almost the same boundaries as the present cas-
pian sea another very small sea took the place of the
present black sea in the valley now occupied by the
vast mediterranean two prehistoric seas were found
all four of these seas were without outlets

       the planetary swirl

as the fleet of explorers approached the earth they
were astounded at the rapidity with which its sur-
face moved toward the east they were not far
from the equator where the motion of-the earth as she
turns on her axis approximates one thousand miles per
hour this was enormous in comparison with that of
the moon which turns on her axis at the rate of but
ten miles per hour at its equator as the twenty spheres
came closer to the earth they found that the atmosphere
was moving at exactly the same speed as the surface
they encountered a gale of rarefied air which was mov-
ing so fast it could not be entered in safety

  one of the spheres attempted to descend to the sur-
face only to be swept away by this planetary swirl
this sphere was never seen again neither were any mes-
sages received from it by radio or television no doubt
the pilots lost all control of their space flyer as it was
tossed about at the mercy of the winds after a con-
sultation the entire fleet began moving toward the east
until it was estimated that their speed approximated that
of the surface below when one by one they attempted to
enter the terrestrial atmosphere another sphere drop-
ped a few miles below its companions but it was soon
seen that it was being thrown about entirely out of con-
trol plunging toward destruction a third tried it and
perished in the attempt

  the remainder of the fleet was having trouble in keep-
ing their craft under control even at a much higher al-
titude and in an atmosphere less dense they rose to
a higher altitude and held a consultation it was be-
lieved to be nothing short of suicide to attempt a landing
near the equator consequently it was decided to at-
tempt entering the atmosphere near one of the poles

at that season of the year the north pole was in dark-
ness so the fleet moved toward the south when they
reached the frozen antarctic regions the planetary swirl
was not very noticeable and they had no difficulty in
descending to within a few thousand feet of the surface

  they had no sooner entered the atmosphere than an-
other difficulty presented itself on their own world
winds are entirely unknown they were puzzled by the
fact that their spheres had a tendency to move in a di-
rection other than that desired by the pilots it was some
time before they learned that this was due to air currents
which they later learned existed everywhere on this
strange planet but after the cause for the strange be-
havior of their craft was learned they lost no time in
learning how to overcome the effects of the wind the
frozen wastes of antarctic ice the strange birds and the
strange seals swimming in the icy waters and awkwardly
lumbering over the ice surprised the explorers who
thought no life could exist under such adverse conditions

  but they were not long in learning that the menacing
planet presented many other interesting and beautiful
scenes that were unknown to these daring explorers from
the moon the distant horizon even at very low al-
titudes was quite a contrast to the near horizon of their
own smaller world the rolling waves of the sea gave
them a view that was inspiring and majestic and yet
fearsome the fleecy clouds above them and the clear
blue sky was a remarkable contrast to the sky of absolute
black dotted by millions of tiny stars that existed
eternally above their own world

down to barlenkoz

at last the explorers reached the southern extremity
of the south american continent the pictures
taken at this time were very interesting to the selenites
but to us they would be rather commonplace they re-
semble the motion pictures taken from an airplane of
today except for the fact that nothing is to be seen ex-
cept rivers lakes mountains plains and virgin forests
nothing would indicate that the foot of man had ever
stepped on the surface of the continent much of the
exploring was done at low altitudes while the fleet was
moving very slowly this- gave them a chance to study
and photograph any forms of animal life that were not
frightened away by the spheres in the air

  many of these animals while rather common to a ter-
restrial were considered very strange and peculiar by
the selenites upon whose world animals are more scarce
they were shocked to learn that many of the wild ter-
restrial animals were carniverous a habit unknown to
all the animals of the moon when they came upon a
group of crocodiles in a tropical river they thought they
had found the last word in frightfulness a huge boa
constrictor discovered a short time later made the croco-
diles look gentle in comparison

  in past ages expeditions of vuduites exploring mars
had found that certain creatures of a strange form were
intelligent and forced their domination over the other
strangp creatures of that planet the selenites knew
that it wa possible for intelligent creatures to occupy
forms other than human for that reason they ex-
amined every creature very carefully and very cautiously
for the purpose of determining his mental status when
they found giant turtles serpents and crocodiles several
of the expedition were confident that reptile life was the
most intelligent on the planet i do not mean that they
attributed any high degree of intelligence to these crea-
tures but they were considered a little above the four
	wonder stories quarterly

footed creatures that hurried to safety at the approach of
a reptile

  the four footed animals were a source of wonder to
the explorers on the moon bipeds predominate while
quadrupeds are unknown the selenites attributed this
condition to the fact that the force of gravity of the
earth made four legs necessary to carry the enormous
weight of the body the earth according to them was
unfit for man who was a biped

a battle with a tyrannosaurus

near the mouth of the amazon river the explorers
found a creature that was more of a mystery to us
than he was to the selenites my first glimpse of the mo-
tion pictures of this creature was one of the most sur-
prising things encountered during our sojourn on the
moon  had to have that particular scene shown to me
several times before i felt safe in identifying the monster
as the giant tyrannosaurus rex natures largest and
most terrible living engine of destruction the most
frightful of all beings that ever roamed over the earth
in any of the past ages according to our own scientists
this creature belonged to a much earlier age and was as
extinct  years ago as he is today

   what right did he have to make an appearance at this
comparatively recent date all dinosaurs had sup-
posedly perished during the latter part of the mesozoic
period the second period in the history of terrestrial life
before the early mammals of the cainozoic ages prob-
ably a few survivors of the earlier ages had continued to
exist in warmer climates long after their species were
believed to have become extinct probably nature her-
self through ages of evolutionary changes had re-
modeled the form and size of the early giant reptiles
producing other types many of which still survive in
that case this creature could have been an atavism a
throw-back to an earlier age rather than a true tyran-
nosaurus but regardless of how he happened to be
here he was the only dinosaur ever photographed by the
selenites and the only one of which any authentic rec-
ord remains

  as the spheres approached the giant tyrant lizard
the monster was wading in the river probably searching
for food only his head neck and smaller forelegs were
above water as he saw the spheres above him he chal-
lenged them to fight unlike the other living creatures
who hurried to cover as the spheres approached them
this undisputed master of his environment did not know
the meaning of fear he rose on his strong hind legs
lifting half of his body out of the water and waded closer
to the shore to meet his enemies he now looked like he
might prove to be a monster sea-serpent as the true shape
of his body was not yet revealed as the spheres failed
to come closer the giant reptile submerged his body but
a few minutes later he was seen nearer the shore still
in deep water with only his eyes above the surface the
selenites did not know whether he was trying to hide
from them or merely waiting for them to come closer

   at last one sphere decided to get a better vifw of the
submerged monster and came to a position about fifty

 a later expedition of selenites reported seeing a group af cate men
 fighting and vanquishing a tyrannosaurus this story was verified
 by every member of the expedition but inasmuch as they were
 equipped for photgraphing everything of interest and failed to securo
 pictures of this battle and brought back pictures of things less in-
 teresting their story has been doubted selenite scientists declare it
 impossible for savages to annihilate such a ferocious creature unless
 the cold blooded tyrannosaurus were handicapped by cold weather or
 was sick and about to die of natural causes i feel inclined to agree
 with those who doubt the story-w h h

feet above him seeing that it was not coming closer
the reptile attacked the sphere he tried to jump up
and reach it but failed to get entirely out of the water
he was now very angry his tail was lashing the water
and his forefeet were madly clawing the air he uttered
no sound but his jaws were snapping in anticipation of
the dinner he expected

  after observing his anger in the water for several
minutes the selenites decided to try and entice him out
on dry land keeping just out of his reach they moved
toward the shore the tyrannosaurus followed them
out on dry land he now looked to be about forty feet
from snout to tail and his powerful hind legs were taxed
to the limit to carry the weight of his enormous body
he showed his rage by clawing the ground and snapping
at the air several times he tried to leap up into the air
to reach the mysterious enemies who so easily eluded
him but he was no better at jumping than an elephant
the enormous muscles of his two hind legs were unable
to propel his body more than two feet into the air

   his anger now amused the selenites who did several
things to tease him a big bundle on the end of a long
rope suspended from one of the spheres was offered to
him he became more active than ever as he tried to
grasp this tempting mouthful but it was always just out
of his reach after several hours the monster was very
tired and only by letting the bait come within a few feet
of him could he be tempted to strike at it the sun
was nearing the horizon and the selenites decided to de-
story the creature before he could return to the water

  the bundle of waste material was dropped to him
while he was amusing himself by tearing it to pieces
with his mighty teeth and small forelegs another bundle
was being prepared this second bundle contained noth-
ing but explosives as it was dropped from the sphere
at the end of a rope he opened his jaws like a crocodile
and again rose on his hind legs the package was drop-
ped into his enormous open mouth which closed upon
it

   the explosion blew his terrible head to atoms but his
body became more active than ever he clawd the
ground with both feet rolled over and over and again
tried to leap into the air his tail was striking terrific
blows knocking trees over as his headless body continued
to writhe in agony here was another mystery to the
selenites they could not understand a creature so
frightful as this who refused to die after his head was
blown to atoms they had the idea that his head was
not the center of his intelligence probably his brains
were located in some other part of the huge body

   but they determined to destroy the monster so a heat
ray was turned on him this heat ray consumed his
entire body but the last part to be destroyed continued
to move until it was utterly charred they had failed
to find where his brain was located and it was believed by
many that the creature never had any but they knew
that he was the master of his environment a creature
armed with such powerful natural weapons who refused
to die until the last part of his hideous body was con-
sumed was an antagonist against whom no living crea-
ture could prevail after this incident they refused to
let their spheres touch the ground for fear of being am-
bushed by other creatures such as this the motion pic-
tures of this specimen of frightfulness has produced
more nightmares among the selenites than any other
single thing it put a stop to terrestrial exploration for
centuries because no one dared venture upon a world
where such monsters were known or believed to exist

             chapter iii
             signs of life

atlantis was the next continent to be explored
the spheres separated as they reached this con-
tinent but kept in touch with each other by radio
and television they were united as they crossed a nar-
row channel separating atlantis from africa they
again separated for the purpose of exploring the con-
tinent that has always been a dark mystery even to our
own race several strange creatures that slightly re-
sembled the human form were discovered on the african
continent these animals known to us as monkeys
apes and gorillas puzzled the explorers at once they
jumped atthe conclusion that they were human beings
whose present condition had been produced by a back-
ward evolution they thought this was the result of
natures attempt to adapt humanity to the adverse con-
ditions of the giant world many of our own scientists
have tried to prove that our own race has developed on
our own planet from creatures such as these thirty-
two thousand years ago these selenites tried to prove
that the apes were merely the degenerates of the human
family on a world not adapted to their needs after
reading their arguments and studying this theory i came
to the conclusion that they were no more ridiculous than
some theories i had taught years ago and no doubt would
still be teaching had i not visited another world and
seen the true origin of man

  one sphere had just passed over a range of mountains
on the western coast of africa at an altitude of about ten
thousand feet when something was observed on the
ground that resembled a cultivated field thinking that
this might lead to the discovery of intelligent or civilized
beings the selenites decided to descend cautiously and
photograph anything of interest that was to be found

  fearing that they might frighten the creatures what-
ever they might prove to be they began their investiga-
tion with powerful telescopes from the air one ob-
server soon found something of interest when he in-
formed his companions of the discovery and gave the
location all telescopes were turned upon a pair of scanti-
ly clothed human beings whose skins originally white
were tanned to a light brown this couple one of each
sex and evidently a pair of lovers were sitting on the
trunk of an overturned tree one arm of the young
man was thrown affectionately over the shoulder of the
maid who was listening to something her companion was
trying to explain as he pointed to the skin of some animal
t his feet probably he was doing something that all
young men still enjoy doing boasting of his power over
his enemies and trying to persuade her that he was just
the fellow to protect her from her enemies also

  perhaps the description of this scene should be omit-
ted or i will find myself writing a love story something
i would not do even if i knew all the details there are
enough other things to describe things that proved more
interesting to the selenites as i am sure they will prove
to the readers of the twentieth century at a distance
of about one quarter of a mile from these two lovers a
number of overhanging rocks and openings denoted caves
in the cliffs at the entrance of these caves were numer-
ous piles of stones that were evidently placed there to
be hurled at any enemies that might attack from the
cleared field below in the shade of the trees surround-
ing the caves on the mountainside several men scantily
clothed in skins were to be seen lying on the ground

the planets	

their weapons of wooden spears clubs and huge stone
hammers were scattered about them far below them
in the cleared fields were a number of women pulling
weeds and undesirable plants up by the roots thus mak-
ing it easier for their crops to grow

a battle with a sabre-toothed tiger

from a cave on the opposite side of the clearing a
naked boy was seen climbing down the cliff he
was just starting across the field toward the women when
a commotion in the bushes startled him as he turned
to look a cry of mortal terror escaped his lips and a
giant sabre-toothed tiger leaped at his victim with a
cry that not only paralyzed the lad but caused the se-
lenites to tremble

  the women in the fields screamed and seized their
children dragging them to the shelter of the caves which
now like a net of angry hornets was alive with hun-
dreds of savage warriors armed with their crude
weapons the men swarmed down the cliffs to attack
their enemy who was now snarling over the dead body
of his prey the female of the species today may deny
that she is more deadly than the male but when her
children are threatened she would probably prove just
as deadly as the ladies of this prehistoric tribe of cave
men long before any of the warriors reached the
enemy women from the caves were hurling stones from
the many small piles with such force and accuracy that
the sabre-toothed tiger was bellowing with pain and rage
and could not devote his entire attention to the furious
regiment of infantry advancing toward him on all sides

  one of the most fiercely fought battles of all time was
witnessed by the explorers whose cameras recorded
every movement and every sound of the battle for a
brief time the giant beast crouched on the ground while
his long tail waved over his back like a battle flag it is
impossible to determine whether the beast charged the
naked warriors or the savages charged the sabre-toothed
tiger but with a fierceness that was about equal on
both sides the opposing forces met neither side knowing
the meaning of mercy or quarter nor the fear of death
like an avalanche of fury the giant tiger was in several
places at the same time mowing his enemies down with
his cruel fangs and claws the warriors had no shields
and but few weapons other than those provided by na-
ture but they fought with a fierceness that would make
the warriors of any modern nation sue for peace they
never turned their backs to the enemy but rained blow
after blow upon the head and body of their foe

  the women of the tribe seeing that they could no
longer hurl stones without doing as much damage to their
men as to their enemy climbed down the steep cliff and
came to the aid of their husbands fathers and sons
many of whom were now lying on the ground wounded
and probably dying as these additional foes appeared
the tiger turned and ran followed by his shouting
enemies whose mad charge was just as furious as his
own for the second time the great cat crouched with
his belly to the ground waving his long tail above his
back as he prepared to charge

   for the second time the battle started this time with-
out any intentions of either side running away the
blood-curdling cries of the tiger mingled with the battle
cries of the warriors and the screams and moans of the
wounded and dying the civilized men witnessing the
battle from a position of safety could not say that this
sound came from the animal and those came from hu-
man throats for several fierce minutes the battle con-
uustrou by paul

the monster became more active than ever as he tried to grasp tfiis tempting mouthful but it was always

just out of his reach


the war of the planets



tinued until the terrific force of a blow from a huge
stone hammer struck a vulnerable spot on the leg of
the tiger breaking the bone after this the cat ceased
to jump but continued to fight against the scores of clubs
and war-hatchets that were hammering his body with
merciless blows

  at last the tigers efforts became more feeble and
those of the savages became more intense the tiger
ceased to move but the warriors continued to hammer
him the battle was over the victorious warriors lifted
their fallen foe to their shoulders and triumphantly car-
ried it toward their caves while the women probably not
quite so deadly as the male but much more merciful and
humane turned their time and attention to the wounded
and dying soldiers whose bodies were strewn about the
battle field

  i find it impossible to describe the surprise of the
selenites as they witnessed the battle their theory that
humanity could not exist on the new world was proven
false here was a tribe of human beings who had
proven that they could not only stand upright and carry
their own weight but could also outfight the cruel fangs
and claws of carnivorous beasts at first they were
ashamed to admit that these savages were descended
from their own common ancestors but before the battle
was over they envied the courage of their fighting
barlenkozian cousins

a visit from a deity

the selenites wanted to help these savages but they
did not think it wise to give them things they would
not know how to use they wanted to get into com-
munication with them but realized that even if the
languages were about the same as their own evolution
had made many changes in both during the intervening
twenty five centuries and neither could understand the
new words of the other when the sphere was first no-
ticed the savages hurried to the shelter of their caves
and overhanging rocks but soon an old man ventured
forth this was probably the king or priest of the tribe
much wiser than the others when it was seen that he
suffered no harm others made their appearance

  the old chief shouted to the sphere but his words
were not understood a selenite shouted a reply that
brought no response at the example of the chief the
entire tribe bowed their heads in reverence to this strange
deity the selenites could do nothing to make them
raise their heads no doubt this was the first time their
deity had consented to visit them and they must show
him their reverence

  there were but few gifts that could be given the
savages that would do them much good fire was the
one thing the selenites thought they needed more than
anything else they directed their heat ray toward a
huge pile of brush and rubbish which instantly burst into
flames they then dropped a large package of steel
knives in the midst of the prostrate savages as well as
large coils of rope and several articles of clothing

  inside the sphere the selenites had maintained a con-
dition of gravity that was about equal to that of their
own world outside the sphere terrestrial conditions
prevailed and they would be unable to support their own
weight for this reason they could not show the
savages how to use these new presents but believed that
they would learn the purposes for themselves

chapter iv
the vuduites are located

while one sphere of the expedition was wit-
nessing the batde of a tribe of cave men with a
sabre-toothed tiger two other spheres were slow-
ly moving toward the east just north of the sea that
once occupied the great sahara desert but little of
importance was found until one observer saw a fleet
of spheres similar to their own moving toward the south
across the sahara sea at first it was believed that they
were members of their own expedition but after all
attempts to communicate with them by radio had failed
it was decided that they were strangers fearing that
they might prove to be their ancient enemies the vu-
duites the selenites hesitated about making themselves
known

  their radio had just informed them of the discovery
of a tribe of white savages a thousand miles to the west
so they knew that humanity could exist on the giant
world hoping to learn more of this mysterious fleet of
spheres they closed all doors and portholes of their ships
and rose to an extremely high altitude and followed the
strange fleet to their destination which proved to be a
city on the southern shores of the sahara sea they
were surprised to find evidence of a high degree of
civilization surrounding this city strange ships were
floating on the sea and a great wall surrounded the city
to protect the inhabitants against the carnivorous beasts
that evidently roamed through the dense jungle just
outside the wall

  from a lower altitude they were able to see the in-
habitants through their powerful glasses when it was
noticed that they were not black men they could not
understand it as they continued to study the strange
city they made the discovery that the men doing all the
work were of the white and mixed races while in the
more luxurious parts of the city several of the black
masters were to be seen the explorers now knew that
the majority of the aristocratic blacks were inside the
buildings and thus protected from the rays of the tropical
sun while the slaves were working at their tasks re-
gardless of the heat and unaware of the two spheres
high above them watching their every move

  the nature of the architecture of the buildings their
form and arrangement as well as the condition of every-
thing in general told the selenites that the inhabitants
were none other than the descendents of the vuduites
who had been the masters of the white race since the
dawn of their history the selenites had inherited a
deep undying hatred toward the vuduites as well as a
great fear their new discoveries only verified the fact
that barlenkoz was a genuine menace in fact as well as
in name they thought it best that their ancient enemies
remain in ignorance of their existence and never learn
of their homes on the moon knowing that all the at-
mosphere and water had disappeared from the moon at
the time of the destruction the vuduites no doubt con-
sidered the old world uninhabitable since there was
more space in the earth than they could utilize for thou-
sands of years they saw no necessity for exploring a
dead world

  but the selenites were curious they descended to
a lower level in hopes of learning more about the city
but they were observed by those on the ground for
several minutes the inhabitants of both races swarmed
out of their houses to look at their visitors attempts
were made to signal to them but the selenites could


wonder stories quarterly

not understand the signals the vuduites were now
certain that the two spheres were strangers suddenly
there was a mad scramble for shelter as it became evi-
dent that those on the ground feared the strangers in the
sky

  the selenites soon learned that strange rays were be-
ing turned on their ships of space and these would soon
do irreparable damage to their gravity controls con-
sequently they rose in the air and concealed themselves
behind a cloud when they again ventured forth they
found that there were no less than a hundred spheres in
the air trying to locate them the vudu spheres evi-
dently preferred to capture their visitors rather than
destroy them inasmuch as no attack was made and it is
not to be supposed that they had no weapons but the
selenites did not choose to be captured they had
weapons and they used them against their pursuers
bringing many of them to the ground seeing that the
visitors were making their escape the vudu spheres
decided to use their weapons and succeeded in bring-
ing one of the strange spheres to the ground the other
increased its speed and made an escape after which it
radioed its companions and called them together for a
council of war

  some of the explorers favored a surprise attack
against the vudu city and completely destroying it while
others thought it wiser to postpone the attack they
had no way of knowing that there were not other such
cities on barlenkoz and the destruction of one would
only cause trouble with the others they remembered
that they were under orders to use their weapons only
for self defense and although it is not recorded there
was probably a feeling that they themselves might be
annihilated before the destruction of the city was com-
plete

another city found

but at any rate the purpose of the expedition was
to learn as much as possible about the new world
and they remained true to that purpose the entire
fleet returned to the vudu city and maintained a con-
stant watch from a high altitude where they would be
invisible to the naked eye of an observer on the ground
they were unable to intercept any strange radio signals
and it is believed that they either failed to discover the
wavelength used by the blacks or that form of com-
munication was not in use this led the selenites to
believe that there were no other cities with which com-
munication could be had

  but one morning as they were watching this ancient
city on the southern shores of the sahara sea they
learned the error of this theory they saw a small fleet
of spheres rise into the air and move across the sea
toward the north the selenites followed at a safe
distance in order to learn their destination the vudu
fleet followed a straight line toward the north across
the sea and over a mountainous region and followed
the course of a river through a deep valley to a smaller
sea upon whose shores several smaller cities were to
be noticed this region being in a more temperate
climate was more favorable to human habitation

  in this valley over which now roll the waters of the
mediterranean several cities were found of various
sizes connected by roadways upon which the commerce
and transportation between them was carried the
gravity-controlled spheres were evidently not used ex-
tensively it was believed that their use was confined
to the aristocratic blacks who feared to trust such

valuable secrets to their slaves who were constantly
looking for an opportunity to escape the countryside
was populated by the blacks who lived in beautiful
mansions while the slaves were kept in chains and
permitted to enjoy only a miserable existence in wretched
hovels it was almost an exact duplication of conditions
that existed for thousands of years on the moon and
the lost planet where humanity supposedly had its origin
ancient tiverpo the manual labor was all done by the
slaves who were still rebellious and trying to escape
and form small tribes of their own while the aristo-
cratic black masters continued to enjoy their ancient
condition of idleness and luxury

   it was with difficulty that this region was explored
 by the selenites they knew the dangers that would
 -arise should they be discovered the conditions at
 this time gave them an idea of the past there was
 still much conjecture as to the events when the first
 vudu spheres arrived from the moon  years earlier
 it is known that they were of a scientific nature and
 knew more about the control of gravity than the selen-
 ites at the time of this first exploration it is possible
 that they used small devices attached to their bodies for
 the purpose of nullifying the effect of their added
 weight as they arrived from a world whose gravity
 was only one-sixth as powerful as the earths if this
 is true the succeeding generations born on the new
 world developed a muscular strength that made their
 movements more natural easier than any other animal
 the human race can be adapted to strange conditions

chapter v
a battle with the vuduites

two weeks had been spent in observing the con-
ditions in the mediterranean valley before the
explorers were discovered during this time it
was learned that the black races was still supreme and
the whites were either in slavery or living a savage
life of fierce cave-men the third race created in a
despairing effort to maintain vudu supremacy by the
debasement of vudu blood still enjoyed a condition
that was exempt from slavery but denied the privileges
of citizenship white and black alike seemed to resent
the presence of the mixed race their migration to
other lands was not only permitted but encouraged and
aided by the blacks while the whites were fighting
for their freedom from slavery and the right to form
tribes of their own the brown race was being aided in
establishing homes in distant lands they were per-
mitted to carry scientific knowledge with them as well
as anything that would make them safer from their
natural enemies

   it was while observing a sphere on the ground making
 preparations for the migration of a number of the
 surplus members of the mixed race that the fleet of
 explorers had approached closer than usual to the
 ground their usual caution had been forgotten in
 their desire for more knowledge of course they were
 observed and a few minutes later every vuduite sphere
 in the city was taking to the air the selenites at-
 tempted to elude their pursuers by climbing to a higher
 altitude but the pursuing spheres followed them and a
 fierce battle took place

   it was a battle of rays both parties had the same
heat rays and disintegrating rays but the vuduites had
another strange ray that would wreck nothing but the
gravity controls of their enemies and send the alien
the war of

 sphere crashing to the earth for a time the selenites
 were able to destroy the enemy spheres without much
 trouble the vuduites were trying to capture the
 strange ships rather than destroy them fearing they
 would be able to do this and thus learn their identity
 the selenites remained at as high an altitude as possible
 and attempted to escape meanwhile destroying as many
 of their pursuers as possible the blacks soon saw that
 they were suffering great losses without accomplishing
 anything consequently they began making use of
 their weapons and the selenite spheres began to crash to
 the ground but from that altitude any sphere that
 fell would strike the ground with such force that nothing
 would remain by which its identity could be learned
 the battle had started in mid-afternoon and if it were
 not for the approach of darkness and a very severe
 storm it is doubtful if any of the expedition would
 have survived

  throughout the night the explorers sent out radio
signals in the hopes of locating their missing companions
but the signals were unanswered only six of the
original twenty spheres remained after a consultation
it was decided to abandon all plans of continuing the
fight and avenging their fallen companions some pre-
ferred leaving the menacing planet while the leaving
was good but it was decided to continue the explora-
tion as long as a single sphere remained

  the expedition now moved farther to the north
mountains rivaling those of their own world in height
loomed in the distance the lofty peaks of the alps
brought emotions of homesickness to the explorers who
had seen over two-thirds of their number go crashing
to destruction it was with difficulty that the leaders
persuaded their crews to continue the exploration as
the mountains were passed and the region of the rhine
appeared the spirit of adventure again asserted itself
and they began a diligent search for things of interest
on the ground

  strange creatures that could not be dignified by the
name of savages were found in this region they re-
sembled the human being in form but their bodies were
covered with hair they were giants in stature and wore
no clothing of any kind they were even more hideous
than the gorilla of africa whom they resembled as
much as they resembled humanity but they were more
intelligent than any ape

  these creatures already knew the secret of making
fires around which the tribe gathered at the approach
of darkness their weapons were even better than
those of the first tribe of white savages discovered in
western africa as they had bows and arrows shields
and spears with heads of stone

  if the apes of africa were a mystery to the ex-
plorers this ultraprimitive neanderthal man of europe
was worst yet  this creature had the rudiments of an
intelligence mediocre as it was and displayed several
traits of human character as with certain more modern
men greed seemed to predominate his emotions one
specimen that attracted my attention more than any
other had been photographed while killing a giant cave-
bear it was a fierce battle but the giant savage did
not vanquish the giant bear single-handed another
creature slightly smaller in stature probably the female
of the species fought just as fiercely as he did two
smaller creatures of the same type evidently offsprings
of the matured savages took part in the battle and aided
in killing the wounded bear

the planets	

  when the battle was over the human side of their
character was revealed it was all the four savages
could do to drag the dead cave-bear to their own cave
they did not take the trouble to skin the body but
tore it apart with sharp stones while the mother of the
household was cooking a generous portion in the fire
outside the cave the father and the two sons dragged
the remainder inside the cave no part of this body
went to waste greed was showing itself as a part of
their make-up every particle of flesh was stored and
as this was during a warm season it is possible that
the stench of the decaying food drove the whole family
out of the cave and it is just as possible that the
sense of smell was not quite as refined as our own
perhaps these creatures enjoyed the odor of decaying or
ripening meat

  our own scientists have tried to identify these
creatures as the missing link n the process of evolution
between the ape and man the selenites tried the
same thing only by their theory homo neanderthalis
had not degenerated quite to the level of the ape our
scientists were thinking in terms of a progressive
evolution while the selenites could only think in terms
of a backward evolution i am sorry that i can not
say which of the two theories is the more plausible
but when one has seen the motion of this man-like
creature and has heard his wild screams which can
hardly be considered as any form of intelligent speech
he would take no pride in the fact that this creature was
related to our race -either as an antediluvian ancestor or
as a monster with no apparent history or purpose

back to the moon

the six spheres now moved eastward toward siberia
where nothing was found except a vast wasteland
they believed that if anything of interest was to be
found they should go toward the south consequently
the crippled fleet was soon soaring high over the region
now occupied by arabia and persia in the valley of
the tigris and euphrates they found a barbaric tribe
of people but they had suffered such severe losses
that no time was spent in observing their habits and
learning their mode of living several large ships pro-
pelled by the trade winds of the arabian sea were
discovered this means of propulsion was unkown to
the selenites who attributed too great a degree of in-
telligence to the unknown navigators it was not until
a later period that they learned that ships could move
under the power of the wind which was unknown on
their own world

  in india many settlements of people of the mixed
race were found who still carried on a more or less
extensive commerce with the vuduites their cities
while not so well built as those of the blacks were
copied from the latter the practice of human sacrifice
still prevailed and it was believed that their religion
was very similar if not the same as that of the dominat-
ing race

  the brown inhabitants of india were a sea-faring
people whose colonies were found along the southern
coast of asia and the smaller continent of which the
east indies and australia were a part in the eastern
part of am in the region now occupied by china and

japan the brown tribes were following the example
of the vuduites and held many white slaves at a later
exploration it was found that the slaves were free and
living on an equality with their former masters no
doubt the two races intermingled resulting in the yellow
race which now predominates in that section of the
world fearing a battle that would be a repetition of
the disastrous result of too close an investigation of the
vuduites in the mediterranean valley the explorers
did not spend much time in the orient for that
reason the only glimpse of our world at that period was
very brief they were growing weary of the strange
world and wanted to hurry across the pacific explore
the only remaining continent and return to the safety
and comforts of their own world

   as the fleet was crossing the pacific they received
another surprise they saw a fleet of large ships float-
ing in mid-ocean and were convinced that the inhabi-
tants of the earth were in possession of means of
transportation to any part of the earth they cared to
visit the selenites were now over cautious and did
not dare approach close enough to the ships to learn
their identity or their means of propulsion they did
not know whether this was an expedition of explorers
like themselves or ships of commerce returning from
a visit to civilized parts of the western hemisphere
the continent of north america was explored but no
trace was found of man or any animal that remotely
resembled him in central america they found ruins
of buildings that convinced them that civilized man-
kind had once lived in this region and had either died
or migrated to other lands

  the exploration of the menacing planet was now
complete after one year and a half they were anxious
to return to the moon but feared leaving the earth
at that point on account of a possible repetition of the
disasters that occurred as they first arrived they
moved rapidly along the eastern coast of north america
until the polar regions were reached which were now
enjoying a brief arctic summer from the ice cap
of this part of the world they passed through the at-
mosphere into outer space and returned to their own
world with pictures and wonderful stories of the
neighboring planet that had a direct influence on the
history of their world through all the succeeding ages

chapter vi

the first war of the worlds

from the first instant that our earth appeared in
their skies the selenites feared it at first it
threatened to destroy their own little world in fact
it did destroy its surface and make it unfit for human
habitation thus compelling the selenites to live in the
numerous caverns of the interior of the moon the
first exploration was authorized because of fear a
menacing world so close to them was a source of an-
noyance especially when it was possible that it harbored
intelligent creatures that might cause untold injury in
the future

  when the explorers returned and it was learned by
the selenites that their ancient enemies the vuduites
had reestablished their former mode of living on the
new world and were also in possession of much more
muscular strength than they ever dreamed of barlen-
koz was considered more of a menace than ever the
selenites feared the new giant world and they feared
the vuduites whose ancient science was apparently as
commonplace as ever at once it was suggested that

barlenkoz and the vuduites should be destroyed as a
guarantee of their own safety but the idea of causing
an atomic explosion such as had destroyed old tiverpo
was not considered very seriously even if the moon
might by any possible chance survive the explosion
it would fly off into space on a line tangent to its
orbit just as soon as the source of gravity which held it
in an orbit was released

   plans were proposed for poisoning the terrestrial at-
mosphere thus destroying all animal life that existed
on the earth there are records of attempts to put this
plan into execution but these attempts resulted in
failure the supreme council debated the question of
whether or not the terrestrial branch of the human race
should be destroyed but no definite conclusion was
reached many favored extinguishing the black race
before the vuduites attacked the moon others main-
tained that the vuduites considered the moon uninhabit-
able with neither air nor water and therefore a dead
world in every sense of the word this being their idea
it was not likely that they would ever suspect that the
moon harbored a race of white people

  without the authority of the zerko or the supreme
council of the moon several expeditions came to the
earth and attacked their ancient enemies who were now
searching in every remote corner of the earth hoping to
locate and identify their mysterious enemies for many
centuries this condition of affairs remained between the
two worlds the selenites were safe from attack so
they believed and there was a type of people among
them who enjoyed the adventure of a raid against the
black and brown strongholds of course the barlen-
kozians tried to defend their homes and many of the
attacking expeditions never returned to their native
world but no war can ever be won by the nations
who always remain on the defensive

   being of a superstitious nature and great believers
in the supernatural the vuduites possibly attributed
the mysterious attacks to the anger of the powerful
black deity who lived on the sun human sacrifices
were now becoming more common than ever but instead
of appeasing their deity the attacks became more and
more frequent

   it was three thousand years after the first exploration
of the earth that the pacifist party was outnumbered in
the supreme council and it was decided to organize and
equip an expedition to be sent to the threatening world
for the purpose of destroying the vudu civilization
rhis expedition consisting of eight thousand spheres
equipped with several types of destructive rays started
for the earth

the battle of rays

let me interrupt my amount to state that inasmuch
as the selenites still fear our world and its two bil-
lions of inhabitants we were asked to take an oath be-
fore returning to the earth promising that we would
never give certain scientific secrets to our people chief
among the prohibited inventions were their weapons
of defense personally i was very willing to abide
by their wishes because untold injury would result if
we were to make it possible to duplicate certain weapons
and thus place them in the hands of nations and individ-
uals who are more peaceful and law-abiding without
such implements of destruction for that reason i
shall purposely withhold a detailed description and tell
only of the power and use of a few of the more im-
portant rays

  the heat ray was always their favorite weapon
everyone has observed the effect of condensing the
the war of

rays of the sun and focusing the solar light and heat
down to a point it is well known that the larger the
lens the more of the solar rays are thus obtained and
the more intense the heat from a giant lens the re-
sulting heat at the focal point is hot enough to break
down and melt asbestos the first heat rays of the
selenites were obtained by the simple medium of giant
burning glasses

  the selenites are a scientific race and they enjoy
nothing better than duplicating the work of nature by
artificial means for a long time they worked on the
problem of creating an artificial beam of light and heat
equivalent to that of the condensed solar ray none of
these attempts were successful because of the intense
heat generated at the source of the ray which always
destroyed the heat ray projector itself but at last it
was discovered that the heat from the solar arc could
be captured and stored away for future use just as
electrical energy cair be stored away in storage batteries
and later be drawn out and used in its original form

   a description of this process is not forthcoming at
this time but the effect of the result release can only
be compared with the condensed solar ray from a lens
of great dimensions the selenites preferred this
weapon to the disintegrating ray which attacked the
atomic and electronic structure of any object that it
touched and resolved it to its original nothingness the
disintegrating ray accomplishes something that our own
scientists have declared impossible the destruction of
matter directed at a solid rock it would cut a smooth
hole into it the depth of which would depend upon the
power of the ray and the length of time it was per-
mitted to play upon it but in passing through the air
it would destroy the air in its path just as readily a
vacuum was thus created toward which the surrounding
air rushed a low pressure area was thus formed in
the vicinity toward which the air from the surrounding
region always rushed when used on our world this
always resulted in the approach of moisture laden at-
mosphere and severe storms a storm in the vicinity
of a vudu city to be destroyed- greatly hindered the
work of destruction hence they preferred the use of
the heat ray until the city was almost destroyed after
which a storm would not matter very much

   another invisible ray which would wreck the gravity
controls of a space flyer was used but it was not very
easy to operate because of the damage that was often
done to the sphere from which the ray was used since
i am- not even describing the nature of the gravity
controls i can not very easily describe the ray that was
used to wreck them explosives such as are already
known were often used but after it was discovered that
the vuduites had a ray that would cause them to explode
at a distance the explosives were thrown away

  the attack from this vast fleet armed with rays of
destruction was a surprise to the blacks who were un-
prepared to meet such a host of enemies as they
suddenly appeared over the city south of the sahara
sea their work of destruction began inthe jungle
surrounding the city the blacks had hidden their
weapons as the battle started the selenites had every-
thing their own way for perhaps an hour they directed
their powerful rays toward the city reducing it to ruins
and making the terror stricken inhabitants run for the
shelter of the protecting jungle

   but suddenly the tide of battle turned the invaders
found that rays from unknown sources were being
turned upon them they saw their vast fleet being
destroyed before their eyes one by one their spheres

the planets	

went catapulting to the earth in flames it seemed that
the sky was so full of their own spheres that a ray
directed at random was sure to bring several of them
to the ground two hours after the battie had started
the vudu city was a mass of molten rock and over half
of the invading fleet had perished the selenites now
made a hasty retreat across the sahara sea

  as the attack was carried to the cities in the valley
now occupied by the mediterranean the invaders learned
that this was not exactly going to be a surprise attack
the hills surrounding the cities in that region were full
of hidden projectors for several types of rays dis-
integrating rays that annihilated everything they touched
rays carrying more heat than their own and rays that
paralyzed or killed any living creature were used
against the selenites the battle was becoming fiercer
every minute after suffering great losses the selen-
ites fought more desperately

  during the first battle they soon learned that their
great fleet was more of a liability than an asset they
could not remain stationary in the air and use their rays
to an advantage without becoming an excellent target
for the rays from the ground moving about made it
easier to avoid the rays of the blacks but it made it
more difficult to aim accurately and there was a constant
danger of colliding with spheres of their own fleet
it is probable that half as many spheres were brought
down by accidental contact with their own rays as from
deliberated attacks from below

  in the battle of the mediterranean valley the attack-
ing spheres were not in the way of each other they
maintained an orderly formation and concealed them-
selves in the clouds thus making it harder to locate than
from the ground they could see the damage they
were doing to the blacks by means of telescopes

  the cities were falling to pieces and the roads were
covered with human refugees fleeing from the scene
of the battle a closer examination showed that the
majority of the refugees were whites probably slaves
making use of a desired opportunity to escape but
there were black and brown people among them the
sympathies of the invaders were all with the whites and
they did them no intentional harm they dared not
attack the fleeing blacks for fear of destroying some of
the less fortunate members of their own race

  had the battle continued until nightfall the last rem-
nant of vudu cities in the valley would have been
destroyed a terrific storm believed to be caused by
too frequent use of the disintegrating ray had come up
and the invaders sought a position of safety high above
the clouds suddenly hundreds of spheres larger than
their own suddenly appeared out of nowhere andi began
to attack the invaders this time it was the selenites
who did not know the nature nor the identity of their
enemies it was later believed that they had arrived
from some unknown vudu city that had heretofore
escaped discovery by the selenites but there was one
thing that could not be questioned they were fighting
on the side of the blacks

  the invaders had suffered severe losses and now only
a few hundred of their original spheres remained they
put up a desperate fight against the new arrivals but it
was soon seen that the opposing fleet was more ex-
perienced in warfare they moved in an orderly for-
mation and calmly picked off their smaller enemies one
by one while the bewildered selenites behaved like a
frightened herd of sheep seeing that only a few of
their original fleet remained they decided to leave the
vicinity immediately and seek a place of safety but
	wonder stories quarterly

the enemy had other plans they surrounded the selen-
ites determined to prevent a single ship from escaping
as darkness came on the selenites managed to elude
their enemies or at least they thought that was what
they were doing no opposition was made as they
moved stealthily through the lines of their enemies and
moved toward the north

the rout

thjs was exactly what the vuduites wanted as
the last sphere broke through their lines they
turned another kind of a ray on the escaping fleet this
was not a ray of destruction but a number of powerful
searchlights similar to those in common use today at all
airports which made it easy to observe the fleeing selen-
ites the fugitives now made excellent targets as they
continued in a straight line toward the north the
pursuing vuduites picked off one sphere after another
keeping their enemies constantly on the move and con-
stantly worried

  the battle had become a retreat on the part of the
invaders and the retreat had become a disorderly rout
the selenites knew nothing of the orderly military
science of today the ability to act and move as a
single unit under the command of one man was un-
known to them as a mob they had attacked as a
mob they had fought and as a mob they retreated each
man had but one single purpose and one single instinct
that was the instinct of self preservation the strongest
instinct of any creature of flesh and blood preservation
or protection of the -race was forgotten it was now
a case of every man for himself

  but the pursuing spheres retained their self control
as a single unit under the command of a single person
they acted with but one single purpose the nature of
which the inexperienced warriors from the moon did
not understand nor did they care in particular as long
as they could place more distance between themselves
and their enemies but try as they might the enemy was
always close behind as soon as the selenites stopped
to reorganize they would find a heat ray from one of
the pursuing spheres melting a hole in one of their ships
or a disintegrating ray playing upon them the mad
flight continued until the northern ice cap was reached
after which the selenites suddenly became homesick and
passed through the upper atmosphere into outer space

  they now thought they had eluded their pursuers
whose searchlights were no longer to be seen they
felt certain that the vudu spheres were unable to travel
in outer space they came to a stop and attempted
to count their losses but the pursuing fleet was upon
them the selenites scattered in a desperate attempt
to elude their enemies but they learned that their ene-
mies could scatter too the vudu spheres now outnum-
bered the selenite six to one and each separate ship
found itself followed by six enemies larger and more
powerful than itself it was now a case of every ship for
itself some stopped and attacked their pursuers but
in a battle of this kind there could only be one result
the pursuing spheres could not see the wisdom of
letting one small selenite ship of space destroy six of
their number it is an insult to the intelligence of the
reader to say which of the seven spheres was to go
crashing to the earth

  this was the first time since the destruction that the
selenites as a unit had been engaged in warfare they
now knew that this was one thing of which they were
ignorant any nation or races that is unaccustomed

to warfare is certain to have a number of cowards in
their midst one coward at the controls of a selenite
sphere and the enemy had accomplished his purpose
and it proved that there were several cowards

  with no other thought than that of escaping from
their enemies the remaining spheres selected a straight
course to the moon with no other thought than chasing
their mysterious enemies to their lair learning their
identity and carrying the war to their own territory the
vudu spheres pursued them true to their one am-
bition that of saving their own lives the selenites
rushed to the entrances of their underground cities
the vuduites did not attempt to follow but remained
on the outside soon other spheres were to be seen
rushing to the safety of the cavernous interior of the
moon but the vudu spheres were waiting for them the
homes of their enemies was now found and there was no
excuse for letting other selenites escape as the re-
mainder of the fleet returned they were picked off one
by one by the avenging vuduites

  but this was not the end of the first war of the
worlds after suffering the attacks of the selenites
for thousands of years they determined to return the
compliment by destroying their ancient enemies thus
ending for all time the attacks of the selenites against
a race that was doing them no injury the vuduites
had differed only in their creed and color and the pos-
session of an history and pride in it which they fought to
uphold

  as yet the black race had not begun to fight the
militarist party of selenites repented their crime against
humanity as they saw their own people men women
and children scientist and illiterate militarist and pacifist
alike perishing under the attacks of the vuduites

imprisoned

never suspecting that the world would be carried
to their own world the selenites were totally un-
prepared all their weapons of defense had been used
to equip the vast fleet that set out to destroy the blacks
no others were available on such short notice and the
vudu spheres had everything their way at every
entrance to the cavernous interior that they could find
the blacks turned their heat rays which melted the
surrounding rock this lava-like mass flowed down
into the entrances sealing them as the lava cooled

  human life can not exist without the sunlight and
its ultra-violet ray the selenites maintained their
underground existence by bringing the rays of the sun
to their luxurious apartments in the cavernous interior
of their little world at mt tycho where a strange
glasslike substance was found in abundance a monster
solar power plant was constructed ages ago by means
of huge lenses and reflectors they had learned to capture
the rays of the sun convert those rays into energy
transport the energy to their caverns and change it back
to sunlight with all the rays of life and growth but
since the sun shone on tycho but half the time one
solar power plant was not enough to supply their
needs for the entire lunar day therefore two other
smaller plants were constructed on the other side of
the moon each plant about one third of the distance
around their world so that one was either receiving
the full rays of the sun or two were receiving half or
more at all times this maintained a constant source
of light in their living quarters

  these solar power plants were not overlooked by the
vudu warriors who undoubtedly understood their pur-
the war of

pose there being no weapons of defense there the
attacking fleet had no difficulty in completely demolish-
ing them and thus depriving the selenites of the life-
giving rays of the sun everything on the surface that
could possibly be of use to the selenites was destroyed
their destructiveness was so thorough that more worth-
less objects than useful were destroyed they were
taking no chances against their enemies ever surviving
the raid

  of course the selenites made several attempts to
reopen the entrances to their caverns but the vudu
guards were constantly on the watch and had no diffi-
culty in keeping them imprisoned in their own apart-
ments like ants trying to reopen the entrances to their
dwellings the selenites continued their efforts during
the long lunar night they would succeed in reopening
a passage but their enemies would locate it the next day
and close it up for years this siege continued while
the selenites were dying by the thousands

  at last a selenite scientist developed a machine that
by using the principle of gravity control caused the
generation of any amount of power desired from which
they manufactured artificial sunlight and the life-giving
rays their atmosphere being entirely synthetic they
liad but little difficulty in keeping it breathable their
foodstuffs were also a synthetic product made by the
rearrangement of the atomic and electronic structure
of common materials thus transmitting them into starch
protein fat or any desired element of food after a
siege of one year the population of the moon had de-
creased to about fifteen percent of its former numbers
due to diseases and other unexpected developments
brought about by their imprisonment

  as the selenites developed their substitute for the
solar light their condition became more comfortable
and they did not worry so much about the closed
entrances of their apartments consequently the vudu
guards on the surface began to think their enemies had
died but as a precaution for over twenty years they
continued to watch very closely for any signs of life
meanwhile the imprisoned selenites had made small
openings just large enough for one man to crawl out
these openings were made at strategic places under
the cover of darkness and the guards never discovered
them it was through this means that they observed
the movements of the enemy spheres and learned when
it was safe to venture forth

  after the vuduites had become convinced that the
moon was now a dead world their vigilance was relaxed
many years had passed since any sign of life had
been observed near the old entrances of their caverns
but still another decade passed before the last vudu
sphere was recalled to the earth and then only did the
selenites feel safe in rebuilding their demolished power
plants

chapter vii
new life

before the first war of the worlds the selenites
reached a state of civilization where they considered
no further development possible it had become
stagnant compelled by necessity they now began a new
period of activity and progress which was even greater
than the period of progress that followed the destruc-
tion new inventions were produced and the populace
found a real joy in living no one could now devote

the planets	

his entire time to idleness and pleasure there was work
for all and a condition of real happiness existed

  but what was happening on the larger world while
the selenites were rebuilding their own were the
blacks rebuilding their demolished cities had they
suffered such severe losses as had the selenites these
were some of the questions that puzzled the selenites
but they did not dare to send an expedition to the earth
to answer them only by remaining in ignorance of
the vuduites could they keep their enemies in ignorance
of their own condition or even their own existence dur-
ing the following twenty centuries there is no record of
a single ship of space crossing tha void between the
two worlds

  this period was probably as full of events as any
equal period in our own history but the reader will
not be-bored with events that do not directly concern
the earlier inhabitants of this planet the credulity
of the reader would be taxed to the limit were i to
even enumerate the numerous inventions that were pro-
duced the average human mind of our own world
is incapable of grasping the full details of the hundreds
of seemingly impossible things that were in common
use at this time truth is and always has been stranger
than fiction the greatest imaginative fiction writers of
the present day never dreamed of one thousandth of
the actual facts that had become commonplace on our
sister world at this date long before the earliest begin-
nings of our own recorded history

  six months ago i gave a very brief history of the
moon there is no need of again repeating it but
a few of the outstanding events deserve mention by
scientific means the length of their lives was increased
to over one thousand years this brought about an
overcrowded condition that necessitated a scientific
means of keeping their rate of increase in proportion
to the decrease in the population another important
thing that helped influence the future history of three
worlds was a process by which any object or any part
thereof could be made transparent it was a costly
process and its results were both good and evil it
caused a tremendous increase in crime but this was
offset by its miraculous value to surgery alone in
hands with criminal tendencies great harm was done
but this was remedied by laws making its use a crime
unless authorized by the proper authorities

  invisibility when applied to their spherical ships of
space promised a solution to the problem of what was
happening on the menacing planet it was decided to
endow another fleet of spheres with invisibility and send
them to explore the earth again and learn what the
vuduites were doing but this task almost baffled the
selenites because everything inside the sphere had to
be made invisible as well as the sphere itself it was
a long time before the first sphere was perfected to
any degree of satisfaction and it was still longer before
a fleet of ten spheres was equipped for the exploration
of barlenkoz

an attack from the unknown

the invisible fleet was not prepared any too soon
arrangements were all made and the fleet was in
readiness to depart for the menacing planet when the
solar power plants were again attacked and demolished
all the workers at these three stations had mysteriously
disappeared naturally this was believed to be the
work of the vuduites and it was feared that the blacks
were about to again close and seal the entrances to
                                                                                                      illustration by paul

the martians would carry their helpless victims in an immovable condition
aboard their long ships storing them away until food was scarce


the war of the planets



their apartments the invisible fleet was ordered to make
a thorough search of the surface of their world in the
hopes of locating the marauders and destroying them
if the black race had learned of their existence a war
was sure to follow which would result in the complete
extermination of one of the two opposing races

  the selenites were at the time divided into two groups
which fought each other for control in the supreme
council these groups can easily be compared to the
political parties of the united states one was the
militarist party whose members advocated that the
vuduites should be destroyed before they attempted
the destruction of the selenites the pacifist party
pointed out the terrors that followed the first war of
the worlds and declared that war was a primitive
pastime detrimental to all those who took part in it
and it should be avoided

  after the second attack against their power plants
the militarists became more vociferous than ever and
many of the pacifists deserted their own party and joined
the ranks of the militarists who soon acquired control
in the supreme council after considerable wrangling
in the supreme council it was decided to order the
invisible fleet to find and destroy their mysterious
enemies

  after a diligent search they were located in a wide
crater known to our astronomers as ptolemy whose
location is in about the center of the moons visible
hemisphere ptolemy is one of the widest craters on
our side of the moon it is surrounded by a circular
rim of very high mountains and the earth appears
almost in the zenith at all times this vast crater was
the scene of unusual activity thousands of strange
ships of space were anchored inside it around which
strange creatures entirely unknown to the occupants
of the invisiblespheres were working instead of at-
tacking these unknown creatures they merely photo-
graphed them and returned to report to their zerko
and the supreme council

  for some time their identity was a matter of con-
jecture but at last after searching through the meager
records of the vuduites when they were at their height
on anciefit tiverpo historians identified them as the
canzians the selenites had never made an exploration
of canzian or mars as we will call it the red planet
had never annoyed them and its inhabitants were
believed to be peaceful unless threatened with an in-
vasion from other planets in the remote past about
the time that the moon was first colonized by the
vuduites the black race had tried to colonize mars
they were unsuccessful because the strange inhabitants
had made their objections so determined that every hu-
man being to touch martian soil was killed by the strange
inhabitants for that reason the moon had been colon-
ized and mars was left alone

  at later times expeditions of vuduites had investi-
gated the planet without approaching too closely they
had come to the conclusion that the planet was suffering
its death-throes the inhabitants had a hard task to
remain alive only the surface of the planet was used
and their water supply was barely sufficient to supply
their needs hence canals were used to bring the water
from the melting ice caps of the poles and irrigate
their deserts in order to maintain life

  mars had never been considered a menace by the
selenites but ancient records of their former masters
told them that mars was the most dangerous planet of

   	canzian is the selenite word for martian

the entire solar system its inhabitants were very in-
telligent probably equal or greater than the human
race but inasmuch as they did not resemble humanity
in form they would not hesitate to wipe them out of
existence if an opportunity were offered the martians
were known to be very warlike they were constantly
fighting among themselves and mercy was unknown to
them their world was no longer able to support them
probably they were looking with envious eyes toward
the other worlds when they made their appearance on
the moon and destroyed the only evidence of life they
found it was believed that they were planning to over-
run the little world when it was learned that they
were doing something in the crater of ptolemy the
invisible fleet was ordered to destroy them without
making any attempt to learn what they were doing

coming of the martians

to the selenites the martians were very strange
creatures to a present day terrestrial they
would be no less strange but a name would be waiting
for them we would call them giant ants in appear-
ance they resembled ants more than anything else but
their habits did not coincide with the habits of any
known species of ants the ant is known to have an in-
telligence but he always does the same thing in the
same way the martians possessed an intelligence
greater than any ant known today and there was as
much difference between individuals as there is between
human beings these martians who were about three
feet long were building cities in the crater of ptolemy
when first discovered these cities were very crude
they resembled nothing more than the common anthills
of the present day

  when the invisible fleet came to destroy them they
found that they were leaving their newly built cities
in their long cigar-shaped space flyers at once the
selenite commander radioed this information to his
zerko who gave his orders to the fleet

  one invisible sphere remained behind to destroy the
martian cities and the other nine followed the strangers
into outer space it was soon learned that they were
heading directly toward the earth the martians en-
tered the terrestrial atmosphere near the north pole
and quickly moved toward the eastern coast of asia
as soon as the first human dwellings were found the
martians attacked small bombs were dropped from
the space flyers which exploded and released a gas
that paralyzed all living creatures as soon as this gas
would clear a martian ship would descend and the giant
ants would devour the helpless human beings and
animals who were not dead but living in an immovable
condition that may well be called a living death appar-
ently this strange gas paralyzed the motor nerves of the
victim leaving the sensory nervous system intact it was
believed that the victim could still see and hear all
the terrors and feel all the agonies but was unable to
move a single muscle

  at first the martians devoured all their victims but
after their appetites were satisfied they would carry the
helpless victims aboard their long ships probably storing
them away until such a time as food was scarce the
selenites believed that the workers at their own power
plants had suffered a similar fate several of the crew
wanted to attack and destroy the martians which they
were probably able to do with their invisible fleet and
powerful weapons but their commander failed to give
his consent and no martian ship was molested at that

time the commander while an ardent militarist has
been branded a coward by the remainder of his crew
and the more peaceful selenites unfortunately he never
returned to his own world to answer to these charges

the asiatic disaster

the mixed races living in eastern asia were at the
mercy of their foes the martian fleet which
numbered several thousand ships now spread out over
the inhabited regions devouring their victims or storing
them away like a plague they swept over the defense-
less country no living thing plant or animal was im-
mune to the effect of the paralyzing effects of their gas
bombs vegetation died after being exposed to the
gas and the path of the martians was easily traced
across the doomed continent still the armed selenite
commander in an invisible sphere out of the danger
zone continued to look idly on while millions of men
women and children were meeting a fate far worse
than death

  after the martians learned that the terrestrials were
unable to fight their numerous ships they abandoned the
use of the gas bombs and attacked their victims in
person against an army of giant ants three feet in
length the terror-stricken inhabitants were powerless
it was only a matter of a few weeks until the country
was as bare as a desert devoid of either plant or animal
life while the raiding martians had not lost a single
ship the invaders next turned their attention to the
continent now sunken that once included the east
indies and australia the brown and black inhabitants
of the vast region suffered a fate similar to that of their
neighbors in eastern asia

the selenites to the rescue

the martians had moved westward into india and
were busily engaged in laying waste the numerous
small cities in that country but while they were de-
vouring or storing away the bodies of their victims
they met with a surprise they were suddenly attacked
from the air by hundreds of vudu spheres the mar-
tians outnumbered their enemies forty to one but one
side was about as well armed as the other and the
selenites saw that it was going to be a battle that would
mean the extermination of one or the other of the
opposing forces they hated and feared both the mar-
tians and the vuduites but their sympathies were with
the human race they had seen the destruction that
had resulted when the martians attacked the helpless
cities of the yellow and brown people of asia and they
knew that a similar fate awaited their own world if
the martians ever learned of their existence as be-
tween the two hated races they preferred to have the
vuduites as their future neighbors encouraged by the
valiant attacks of the blacks the selenite commander
was aroused to action he ordered his invisible fleet
to join forces with their erstwhile enemies and attack
the martians

  the vuduites were excellent fighters the martians
too fought well but they were badly handicapped they
were out of their natural element and were far from
being as efficient as they would have been had the battle
taken place on their own world the clouds and storms
brought about by an excessive use of the disintegrating
rays brought considerable trouble to them but the
vuduites used the clouds to their own advantage hiding
among them the blacks were able to attack unseen

without exposing themselves to danger the storms
brought several martian ships to the ground with a
crash but the vuduites had long since learned how to
control their craft in all sorts of terrestrial weather
considering that the blacks were outnumbered the odds
were about even it was the selenites in their invisible
spheres who held the balance of power ancient hatreds
were forgotten humanity was fighting against alien
creatures for the right to continue its existence on its
own world black and white fought side by side even
though the white did not dare let the blacks know of
their presence

  the utter disregard for danger on both sides astounded
the selenites the martians and vuduites would rush
at each other each heedless of the others weapons each
determined to destroy their antagonists before the an-
tagonist could destroy them it was not uncommon
to see a vudu sphere rush into the midst of a group
of martians and attack the entire group sending a
score of the long space flyers to the ground before meet-
ing destruction itself more than once when a vudu
sphere was hard pressed by a number of martians an 
invisible sphere from the moon would go to its as-
sistance many times a vudu sphere would attack a
number of martians only to find its enemies crashing to
the earth even before their weapons were brought into
play due to the efforts of their unseen allies

  it was the nine invisible spheres from the moon that
turned the tide of the battle from a safe elevation
above the antagonists they could direct their rays against
the martians with more effect than the entire vudu
fleet one invisible sphere could come within a few
thousand feet of any number of martians and send them
all to the ground while the helpless invaders were look-
ing in all directions for their mysterious enemies prob-
ably the martians thought this was some uncanny weapon
of the strange inhabitants of the larger world while
the vuduites no doubt thought they were being aided
by the supernatural powers of their deity

  several habits of the martians mystified the vuduites
and selenites alike apparently there were a number of
martian ships that were not equipped for fighting
these ships always withdrew from the scene of battle
accompanied by a bodyguard of fighting ships when
one of these non-combatant martian ships was en-
dangered the other fighting ships regardless of what
they were doing came to its assistance seeing that they
were disregarding their own safety in order to protect
the larger ships the vuduites centered their attacks
against the non-combatants but it was soon seen that
this was unwise because attacks of that- kind always
drew a host of fighting ships to their assistance the
blacks then adopted other more effective tactics

  while feigning an attack against the favored martians
the attention of the fighters was drawn aside thus mak-
ing excellent targets of them for other spheres seeing
the tactics employed the invisible selenites spheres aided
the blacks in bringing hundreds of fighting martians to
the ground another habit of the martians was to fol-
low an enemy to the ground and capture the human oc-
cupants or in case there were no survivors to take the
dead bodies of their foes inside their own ships prob-
ably the vuduites knew the fate in store for any victims
taken in this manner at any rate they never permitted
a martian ship to rise again if it were seen to descend
near a fallen sphere

  the selenites thought it probable that the aristocracy
of the martians were in the non-fighting ships prob-
the war of

ably the brains of the expedition were in these larger
ships that were so well protected if they were de-
stroyed would the martians be without leaders the
selenites did not know but they determined to give the
protected ships a surprise attack consequently an in-
visible sphere would take a position of safety directly
above the ships to be attacked and before the protectors
could understand what was happening the martian ship
would crash toward the earth the protecting ships
would now fly madly about like an enraged family of
hornets looking everywhere for something to attack and
finding nothing meanwhile another of their favored
ships would fall to the ground

retreat

the last day of the battle was spent in this manner
while the vuduites looked on from the protection
of the clouds far below the fighters the martians be-
lieved it was these spheres hiding in the clouds that were
attacking from a distance their weapons were useless
at long range so they would rush toward the vuduites
who were able to pick them off as fast as they came
within range of their powerful rays the martians were
now entirely on the defensive and saw that they were
losing a few more days and their protected ships would
all be lost they never appeared to notice the loss of any
number of fighting ships but the loss of a non-combatant
was terrible darkness was approaching and the mar-
tians were making preparations for a retreat but none
of the human fighters understood their intentions

  the martian ships were far speedier than the spheres
of either race under cover of darkness and severe
storms they eluded their pursuers and disappeared the
next morning a diligent search was made for their
enemies but weeks passed before the martians could be
located in a valley in northern india they had de-
serted their ships and taken refuge here in the dense
vegetation digging long tunnels into the ground and
piling dirt near the entrances thus making giant ant-
hills such as they had built in the crater of ptolemy on
the moon the vuduites watched them in wonder as
they continued to labor apparently the martians were
entirely unaware of the spheres hovering only a short
distance above them

  the war seemed to have been forgotten the mar-
tians were working day and night more industriously
than any creatures that had ever been seen or recorded
by cither race of humanity loose dirt continued to
pile higher and higher around the entrances of their tun-
nels  ant-hills several hundred feet in height were taking
form at last all work stopped the excavations were
finished and their underground homes and cities com-
pleted from the larger ships those that had been so
veil protected during the recent battle a number of
larger winged martians emerged the observers did
not understand the meaning of this but to one who has
studied the activities of ants the process was very simple
these were the queen ants the females of the species
whose sole purpose in life was to lay eggs to propagate
their kind the other martians were all workers and
fighters whose individual lives were not of much value
to the colony and probably of less value to themselves
inasmuch as they did nothing but toil and fight

  accompanied by a bodyguard of dozens of fighters
armed with strange weapons one queen made her way to
each of the newly built tunnels very soon another task
was begun the workers had started to carry vegeta-
tion into the tunnels while others carried the bodies and

the planets	

           

 parts of bodies of the creatures that had been stored away
 in the martian ships many of the bodies appeared to be
 still alive and it was believed that they had been kept
 in this state of living death for weeks by some strange
 artificial means in order to prevent decay and decomposi-
 tion it was evident that food was being stored away
 for some future time

    on seeing the pictures of this scene one is moved to
 compassion by the sight of men women children and
 various types of the lower animals being dragged under-
 ground by giant cruel ants one cannot help feeling
 indignant at the observers in the spheres above who stood
 idly by and did nothing but watch and photograph the
 sufferings of the human victims going to a fate far
 worse than death when questioned later the selenites
 could offer no explanation they all had the same story
 namely that they never once thought of their recent bat-
 tle nor did the thought occur to them that these mar-
 tians who were laboring so diligently should be attacked
 they felt no pity for the victims at that time they
 thought of them only as valuable articles of food rather
 than as human beings probably it was due to some
 strange influence exerted by the martians- some
 hypnotic power that could neither be overcome nor un-
 derstood

a transformation

 at last giant ants by the thousands began to emerge
 from the ant-hills and scatter in all directions
 throughout the jungle they seemed to be going no-
 where in particular and everywhere in general with no
 other purpose than to get as far away from the colonies
 as possible the humans in the spheres above were now
 aroused to activity they believed the martians had pre-
 pared a trap for them so they moved away from the
 giant ant-hills they attacked the escaping ants one at
 a time but the latter offered no resistance no one had
 any idea of where they were going nor why

    for several days they continued to stream out of the
 numerous tunnels in single file only to scatter and hurry
 away through the jungle many miles away from their
 starting point their rapid pace was checked and soon it
 stopped altogether it was now seen that the escaping
 martians were dead the selenites thought they had
 been unable to survive the effects of strange conditions
 of the new world probably the temperature the climate
 some unaccustomed condition of the atmosphere or even
 minute forms of bacteria strange to the martians had
 killed them others thought they had died of starva-
 tion  they had not been seen to eat since the exodus from
 the ant-hills began others were of the opinion that
 they had died of fatigue no creatures so active as these
 ants could maintain such strenuous lives for any length
 of time on a world whose gravity was much stronger
 than that to which they were accustomed but i am of
 the opinion that these ants the workers and fighters of
 the colonies died by orders probably from the queens
 their work was done and they were no longer needed
 their future presence would be an expensive nuisance
 that would interfere with the plans of the martian com-
 manders

    the observers now returned to the ant-hills to see if
 the other martians had died the same as the workers who
 had made such a hurried exit from the colonies here
 they met with a surprise that not only puzzled them
 but has puzzled scientists of every age since that time
 at first the ant-hills appeared to be deserted but closer
 investigation showed that they were covered with minia-
	wonder stories quarterly

 ture martians of various colors black white red
 brown and gray ants ranging in size from-one-sixteenth
 to one-half an inch in length were crawling about the
 entrances of the tunnels never before had ants of
 this size been seen jwere they young martians who
 would increase in size until they were three feet long
 would they then over-run the planet and make it their
 own  could humanity survive when this took place 

  both races were puzzled the vuduites took steps to
prevent such a catastrophe heat-rays were directed
against the ant-hills destroying the tiny martians by the
million but the advantage of the martians now lay in
their minute size and their vast numbers they could
hide in the vegetation and deep in their excavations and
thus escape extermination already the smaller ants
were at work with their own excavations building their
smaller colonies under the dense jungle vegetation the
vuduites evidently thought it would be out of the ques-
tion to completely destroy all of them after killing ants
for weeks they were ready to quit probably they
thought the little creatures would still grow to maturity
and produce giant martians

  a number of their spheres having captured several
of the tiny creatures returned to africa probably ex-
pecting to study the smaller ants and learn what they
could about them several spheres remained behind to
watch the movements of the ants and to be on the scene
if there were any unusual developments there were
about two hundred of the original martian ships still in
the valley no evidence of life was to be seen around
them after the martians had taken to their new under-
ground colonies after giving them a thorough ex-
amination and carrying several types of martian ma-
chines inside their own spheres for further study they
began to destroy the long martian ships of space but
ten ships those nearest to the ant-hills were undamaged
the blacks were apparently leaving them for a purpose

  the selenites could not understand the meaning of
the recent events they knew that the martians were
working out a carefully laid plan but for what purpose
did they hope to take possession of the earth and the
moon and abandon their own worn-out planet  it was
only by a long and careful study that they were able to
arrive at any definite conclusions they were astounded
to learn that certain martians were eager to sacrifice
themselves in order that other more favored individuals
might live they believed the workers were either
obedient slaves unable to have a will of their own or
else they differed radically from creatures such as them-
selves it had often been shown that the instinct of self-
preservation was the strongest instinct of any living crea-
tures preservation of the race came second with
these martians preservation of the race appeared to be
their paramount purpose in life if this were the correct
theory the following solution must also be correct

  their own planet was no longer able to support them
they planned to establish colonies on the two worlds
nearest their own in order that their race might survive
after establishing colonies on the moon they turned
their attention to the larger world here they realized
that their former ize was not adapted to the prevailing
conditions of the earth hence they accomplished in one
generation something- that would have taken nature
ages to duplicate through her usual process of evolution
their strange knowledge brought from a strange world
by strange creatures that had developed along lines dif-
ferent from those of humanity had enabled the mar-
tians to change their size during a single generation the
queens and their few attendants had seen to it that their

offspring had matured before reaching their usual size
probably this was done by a different kind of food per-
haps by some intentional characteristic of the eggs-no
one ever knew but in their smaller size the martians
were better adapted to terrestrial conditions the larger
force of gravity was to their advantage they could find
an abundance of food and there were fewer enemies to
annoy them the selenites were positive that the mar-
tians had scientific knowledge which in this respect was
infinitely greater than their own

chapter viii
the return to mars

several weeks had passed with no unusual de-
velopments at the ant-hills the small ants were
as busy as their parents had ever been digging
tunnels into the ground and building thousands of small
mounds they appeared to be unable to notice the hu-
man beings in the vicinity this may have been due to
some defect in their eyes or possibly to an indifference
about things that were beyond their sphere of usefulness
the human observers were no longer paying much at-
tention to the little creatures days would pass without
giving them even a casual glance but at last it was no-
ticed that something unusual was happening with the ten
remaining martian space-flyers the vuduites and
selenites were now all attention had the larger mar-
tians returned or had some of the tiny creatures
grown to the original size had a new group of giant
workers been hatched out and matured in the larger
colonies  whatever the explanation it was evident that
giant ants were at work inside the ships of space pre-
paring them for a voyage of some kind were they
planning another raid against the human inhabitants
if they were the war would begin anew and this time
it would continue until the last martian had been de-
stroyed

  one morning the observers could see that vast num-
bers of giant martians were emerging from the larger
ant-hills and marching in single file into the remaining
ships of space when the ships were filled they rose
slowly from the ground followed by the visible and in-
visible spheres the ten martian ships rose directly
toward the zenith followed at a safe distance by the
spheres no attack was made at this time the martians
were very peaceful and the vuduites more curious than
warlike the selenites remained just far enough be-
hind to be able to see the others they were less ex-
perienced in astronautics than the others and feared the
planetary swirl through which their earlier expeditions
were not able to pass when attempting to land near the
equator they thought it would be just as impossible
to leave the planet at that point as it had been to make
a landing no doubt they thought both the martians
and the vuduites would meet destruction so they re-
mained farther behind

  but the selenites were to learn that the planetary
swirl did not affect a space ship passing outward the
gale of rarefied air moving at one thousand miles per
hour did not affect a body that was moving at the same
rate of speed the effect was no more noticeable than
if the sphere were motionless on the surface of the
planet

  it was soon seen that the martians were leaving the
earth they rose higher and higher increasing their
speed as the atmosphere became thinner the spheres

the fact that the earth carries its atmosphere with it on its rotation on
its axis causes a swirl of swiftly moving air which is hard to enter or
leave
the war of

had all they could do to remain within sight of them
the vuduites probably knew that the martians were
returning to their own planet but the selenites being
less experienced in interplanetary travel had no idea of
their destination they felt certain that it was not mars
because that ruddy planet was to be seen far to one side
they did not realize that instead of going directly to-
ward a body that was traveling almost as fast as they
were themselves the martians were heading toward that
point in the orbit of marr where the planet would be
when they arrived

  the voyage required several weeks and for the first
time white men were piloting gravity-controlled space-
ships outside the effect of the gravity of any of the
heavenly bodies there was one time when the sun
exerted the only noticeable gravitational influence but
i can not hope to give full details of this voyage across
space difficulties presented themselves but were over-
come with ease by the selenites who merely followed
the visible and more experienced ships of space at
times the others were so far ahead that they could not
be seen but other means were utilized to point out
the direction of the nearest ships at last they came
near the planet mars hurtling along as it was at a
tremendous rate of speed it looked as if it would be
impossible to make a landing on it the feat was com-
parable to that of a fly trying to land on a flying cannon-
ball but the selenites were more scientific than any
known species of flies

  the other ships were far ahead in fact entirely out of
sight of the three types of space flyers the invisible
selenite ships were the slowest the martians had
probably made a landing but the selenites could not see
how it had been done the vuduites were no longer in
sight and the selenites felt deserted many millions of
miles from home the planet was now getting farther
and farther away from earth and they could not move
much faster than the planet itself their only remedy
was to set out in determined pursuit of the escaping
world after a period of time that can not be definitely
established the planet was overtaken and the selenites
entered the thin martian atmosphere near one of the
poles several days were spent in flying over the barren
surface of the dying world before any evidence of life
was found

the battle on mars

every form of life on mars was very strange to
the selenite but the only form to have any degree
of intelligence was the giant ants all others acted like
domesticated animals beasts of burden or living food
supplies for the dominating species no time will be
taken in describing martian life or martian conditions
the selenites were searching for but one thing and it
was some time before they found it

   they arrived on the scene in time to see the last of the
vudu spheres go crashing to destruction on the surface
of the dying planet it can not be said that they sym-
pathized very much with their ancient enemies but at
the same time they could see the danger of letting the
martians think the raid against the other worlds had
been a success the air was full of martian ships and
there was no way of knowing which of the thousands
had been to the earth consequently the selenite com-
mander gave orders to destroy all this would convince
the giant ants that the earth and its satellite were dan-
gerous worlds and that it would be much safer to stay
away from them in the future

the work of destruction was started it was no

the planets	

difficult task for the invisible spheres equipped with
many powerful weapons unknown to the martians to
approach any number of ships and turn unseen rays of
destruction against them but on account of the great
number of martian ships the battle lasted for some
time there was no way of knowing just what the mar-
tians thought about it but it can not be questioned that
they were surprised when they saw their vast navies
destroyed by apparently supernatural means before their
very eyes an attempt to escape was their only means
of protecting themselves but it was not so easy to escape
from invisible enemies they did not know which way
to go and often they unknowingly came closer to their
enemies when they thought they were going away from
them

   for ten days the battle continued even at night the
martians were safe neither in their ships nor in their
cities by the time the selenites were satisfied with their
work the planet was in ruins or at least the inhabited
portions were demolished the selenites had never been
in any great danger thanks to their unseen spheres
nine spheres had entered the battle and nine came out
unscathed

   the battle ended and the work of destruction over the
selenites spent several days in exploring the strange
planet they did not find much of interest because the
majority of the survivors had mysteriously disappeared
into their underground cities whenever a martian
appeared on the surface he was in danger of the death-
dealing rays from the nine invisible space flyers some-
where on his world the selenites were now convinced
that there would never be any more danger from mars
they felt that they had convinced the martians that it
would be wiser for them to try to continue an existence
on their own world rather than to attempt to steal other
planets satisfied with their work they decided to re-
turn home

   this was a much more difficult task than the journey
to mars because they had no experienced ships to guide
them they had spent too much time on the red planet
the martians had chosen the proper time to return home
mars and earth having been in conjunction at that time
with the distance between them a trifle less than forty
million miles but after the battle above martian soil
the two planets had both moved in their orbits and the
distance was now much greater the selenites would
have been wise to wait until the movements of the two
planets had been determined and their path through space
plotted but they were poor astronomers-astronomy be-
ing a neglected science at that period in lunar history
spending the majority of their lives in their underground
apartments many of their race had lived and died with-
out ever seen the sun or any of the stars inasmuch as
the earth could be seen from only one side of their
world a larger percentage of their population had never
seen anything but the pictures of the most beautiful ob-
ject in their skies their knowledge of astronautics con-
cerned only the voyages between the moon and the earth
and this knowledge was inadequate for a voyage from
mars to their own world a poor astronomer makes a
poorer astronaut and the selenite had much to learn
about both these sciences

back to earth

the invisible fleet had no trouble in identifying the
planet earth toward which they now directed their
craft the earth and the moon continued in their com-
mon orbit at the rate of f miles per second and the
	wonder stories quarterly

voyagers soon saw that they were not making much
progress without knowing it they crossed the orbit
of the earth and the elusive planet concealed itself be-
hind the sun several times the invisible ships were
separated it was never possible for them to see one an-
other and it was only by magnetic compasses and radio
that they could locate each other at great distances the
radio signals were too weak to be recognized and their
magnetic compasses often lied to them if an iron-
bearing meteor happened to be nearer they would point
toward that instead of a space ship at one time a
swarm of meteors threatened to demolish the entire fleet
and it was only by changing their course that they
avoided this fate venus at one time appeared brighter
than the earth and the commander mistook it for the
earth he directed the invisible fleet toward the wrong
planet and it was not until he observed that it had no
moon that he saw his mistake

  they had spent almost a year in outer space on their
return voyage their supplies were nearly exhausted
and the crew was just about insane it was seen that
the commander could not be trusted his intentions
were good enough but his knowledge of astronautics was
too limited another commander was therefore selected
but as the old one refused to obey his orders mutiny
threatened-a greater disaster than that of being lost in
cuter space

  the original commander retained command of his own
sphere but the remaining eight obeyed the new leader
who was able to change the course of the fleet and to
move it nearer to its destination after coming within
a million miles of the earth they were confronted with
another problem the earth was moving at the rate
of j miles per second around the sun and the moon
was moving at the rate of  miles per second around
the earth to make a landing both of these motions
had to be taken into consideration and it was some time
before this feat was successfully accomplished by the
eight spheres the original commander and one sphere
were never again heard of

  the selenites were astounded by the pictures that
showed every detail of their remarkable adventures
the voyagers learned that soon after leaving the moon
in pursuit of the martians numerous colonies of mar-
tians had matured in the crater of ptolemy but in this
case they were not of such small sizes on the con-
trary the resulting generation was over ten feet in
length but fortunately their numbers were not so great
the martians had probably thought that creatures of this
size would be better adapted to the low lunar gravity
and it would be easier for them to find food and live
in safety on the little world but this single colony on
the moon was short-lived one invisible sphere had no
difficulty in completely destroying it

chapter ix
the calm that precedes a storm

the martian war was ended and still the selenites
knew nothing of the conditions of the black race
the militarists were more restless than ever
the vuduites must be exterminated they cried
there shall be no more war the pacifists declared
this shall be a war to end war the militarists replied
in the supreme council and among the citizens the
argument continued between the two opposing forces
for a time it looked as if a civil war would break out
between the two elements the martian war had

demonstrated that a few invisible ships equipped with
rays of destruction were more powerful than any fleet
of visible ships that could be assembled the militarists
knew that they had the weapons and they were anxious
to use them against the race that had caused them so
much suffering a few centuries earlier

  but there is always a bond of friendship between al-
lied nations the fact that the blacks and whites had
fought side by side against an alien world had created
a warm feeling against a race that had always been hated
and feared after doing a great favor for someone one
always has a warm feeling toward that person the
pacifists had no desire to see the extermination of the
race that had been aided during the martian war we
do not know that the vuduites are a menace to our
world they argued let us send an invisible fleet to
barlenkoz and learn the true condition before we decide
to exterminate them perhaps they are having trouble
enough with those tiny martians who have established
colonies on their planet

  the zerko was finally influenced to authorize an ex-
pedition of invisible spheres to make an investigation of
the prevailing conditions of the black race alfter spend-
ing one year on the earth the expedition returned with
pictures showing the pitiful condition of the vuduites
the blacks were now putting up a desperate fight for
their own existence their supremacy was broken their
slaves were free and countless enemies threatened them
on all sides a race that had never known anything but
luxury and idleness for thousands of years found itself
unable to cope with its host of enemies unskilled in
manual labor they had never been able to rebuild the
cities destroyed during the first war of the worlds when
their slaves rebelled and escaped the protecting walls
around their cities were no longer able to keep back the
carnivores who preyed upon the helpless blacks

  africa was still the center of culture and civilization
but that civilization was only a caricature of the an-
cient glories of the great black race the torrid climate
had increased their lazy tendencies their buildings were
in ruins and they lacked the initiative to rebuild them
their sewer systems had gone to ruin and disease added
to the adverse conditions of progress their escaped
slaves were carrying on an existence as savage cave-
men living amid their enemies through the power of
their muscles and the cunning of their untaught and
dormant minds these tribes of fierce white men en-
joyed attacking their former masters breaking down the
crumbling walls of the vudu cities and carrying away
as plunder anything they desired the blacks still main-
tained a fleet of spheres such as they had used during
the martian war and they frequently attacked the
whites who scattered and hid as soon as a sphere was
seen in the sky the vuduites were accomplishing noth-
ing by these attacks except to make life miserable for
their enemies

  around all the inland seas of the western part of the
vast continent that included all of eurasia and africa
two races were struggling for supremacy the whites
whose only weapons were their own muscular strength
cunning minds and an inherited hatred toward their
former masters were forced to protect themselves con-
tinually from the blacks who had fallen heir to scientific
knowledge and a number of scientific weapons from
their proud and illustrious ancestors it was a struggle
for survival and the selenites could not decide which
race was the more fit to survive skilled muscles and
untaught minds were fighting against scientific minds
and untrained hands the odds were about even but
the war of

if anything the scientific vuduites had the advantage

   in asia the invisible fleet found that there were a few
survivors of the recent martian raids who showed great
promise of rebuilding what had been destroyed in
northern india the tiny ants were as busy as ever un-
molested by any of the larger creatures they were
spreading over the country threatening to build their
tiny colonies all over the earth but the selenites were
convinced that with their small size they could do no
great damage

the pacifists win

after the militarists had learned the condition of
their ancient enemies their strength began to fail
it was evident that the vuduites had their hands full
protecting themselves on their own world and there was
no danger of another attack particularly if they never
learned of the existence of the selenites but the mili-
tarists still spread their propaganda and demanded
vengeance for the imprisonment that had followed the
first war of the worlds they declared that their own
race would never be safe until the vudus had been ex-
terminated the pacifists remained in control and they
maintained that no good would come of the destruction
of a race that was unaware of the existence of the
selenites on the moon a battle of words constantly
raged while on the earth the blood of both races con-
tinued to flow at various times the militarists would
attempt to exterminate the black race by themselves
with visible spheres they raided the blacks and made
their lives more miserable but that wasabout all they
accomplished the vuduites were better fighters than
the selenites and in a battle with rays from gravity-
controlled spheres the blacks were more in their own
natural element many of the private expeditions against
the vuduites never returned and those that did return
were often in a pitiful condition these raids were al-
ways opposed by the pacifists and never sanctioned by
the supreme council but the zerko and the supreme
council had no jurisdiction over them when they were
away from their own world consequently the raiders
were never punished

  it was almost  years ago in the year 
ad not anno domini in the year of our lord but
after the destruction that the pacifists won a com-
plete victory over the militarists it was decreed by the
supreme council that in the future no selenites are
to be permitted to visit or make an exploration of bar-
lenkoz unless the visit or expedition is accompanied and
commanded by the zerko crown prince or persons ap-
pointed by the zerko and approved by the supreme
council it was also decreed that it shall be the duty
of each zerko either before or immediately after his
coronation to see that the menacing planet is explored
and accurate reports made as to the condition and extent
of civilization of all branches of the barlenkozian branch
of the human race

  these laws were made with a view to putting a stop
to the raids against a powerful enemy who had caused
untold suffering among the selenites in the past as well
as for the purpose of obtaining information and warning
of any immediate danger from the world that they con-
tinued to fear the militarists were disappointed for
many years they tried in every way possible to have
the decision of the supreme council overruled by the
citizens but all such attempts had ended in failure at
last zerko haniks commanded that all militarist propa-
ganda cease for a number of years it looked as though

the planets	

his orders were being obeyed the militarists were very
quiet

   but it is always very quiet just before a storm the
militarists were apparently pacified but the zerko the
supreme council and the pacifist party had excellent
reasons to suspect that trouble was brewing krago the
leader of the militarists had just married the twin
sister of zerko haniks he was an ardent advocate of
womans rights and insisted that she had as good or
better right to the crown than her brother whom she
always opposed in everything he attempted on the
moon as well as in our own world there is truth in
the saying uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

   zerko haniks was in constant fear of his unruly sister
and her new husband who had often remarked that after
he obtained the throne his deeds would rival those of
the first zerko who had saved his people from the ter-
rors of the destruction the true character of krago
has never yet been determined even to the present
day there are selenites who regard him as the greatest
man the most capable leader and the greatest militarist
his world has ever produced he has been given credit
for saving his world from the vuduites and making the
moon safe for his own race others paint him as a fiend
incarnate entirely lacking in any sense of fair play and
the greatest criminal in human history compared to
krago caesar and napoleon were weaklings and nero
was an angel

   for a time krago and his bride pretended to abide by
the decision of zerko haniks and the supreme council
but inwardly they rebelled and planned to accomplish
the destruction of the black race with the aid of those
friends whom he could trust they lost no time in call-
ing the militarists together and selecting a group who
promised to follow krago and save their world in spite
of the blindness of the peace-loving zerko and his su-
preme council thousands of followers pledged every-
thing they owned including their lives and those of their
families if need be to save their world from another
raid from the black barlenkozian vuduites from this
group of loyal followers leaders were selected and a
secret expedition to the menacing world was planned

   the plans were made and put into execution so secretly
that no one suspected their true nature but the pacifists
thought krago and his party were too quiet to be out
of mischief they were positive that something was tak-
ing place zerko haniks was certain that his crown was
in danger he was thinking only of his own personal
safety at last krago and his followers disappeared
believing that they had retired to some inaccessible part
of their own world for the purpose of marshalling their
forces and attempting to overthrow the government the
zerko began to make preparations for his own defense
for over a year krago had not been seen or heard of
the little world was so peaceful everything was so quiet
and the suspense so terrible that zerko haniks was in
constant danger of a nervous breakdown but while his
spies were making every effort to locate his enemies
astronomers made the discovery that something strange
was taking place on the earth 

   clouds had covered the surface of the larger world to
such an extent that no telescope could obtain a glimpse
of the surface several lunar days passed and the clouds
seemed to increase rather than scatter at times a mo-
mentary glimpse was to be had of a white snow-covered
surface of the earth at other times the clouds would
part long enough to show that the surface was afire
zerko haniks was about to send an expedition to the
	wonder stories quarterly

earth to learn the true state of affairs when krago sud-
denly appeared on the scene with pictures and a story
that surpassed all records for human daring and wan-
ton destructiveness he was proud of the fact that he
had destroyed the power of the ancient enemies of his
race and reduced a great civilization to a lower level than
that of any creature that ever walked or crawled he
declared that he had made his own world safe for pos-
terity and demanded that the peace-loving zerko abdicate
the throne in favor of his sister and her capable husband

chapter x

kragos war

from the pictures and story brought back by
kragos expedition the selenites learned the facts
of the disasters that had resulted n the final and
complete downfall of the great race of vuduites after
his own defeat by the pacifists krago had made his
plans for destroying the enemies of his race and elimi-
nating the threatened danger from the giant barlenkoz
from the wealth of his followers he had raised enough
capital to put his plans into execution at that time
there were fifty invisible space flyers on the moon after
laws had been passed making it unlawful for private
citizens to visit the earth all invisible spheres were pur-
chased or confiscated by the zerko they were stored
away in a large inaccessible cavern the location of
which was known only to the zerko and a few of his in-
timate friends and advisors zerko haniks was afraid
that his enemies were spying on him and if he were to
be seen visiting the fleet its location would be discovered
for that reason the invisible navy vas seldom visited

  but there was a traitor whom the zerko trusted he
had always been a loyal pacifist but for some reason
probably bribery he secretly joined the ranks of krago
and the militarists he informed krago that the in-
visible navy had been hidden in a vast cavern accessible
only from an obscure crater in an uninhabited region on
the barren surface of an ancient sea bottom krago then
had no difficulty in stealing the spheres and using them
for his own purpose had zerko kaniks known that his
invisible navy was in kragos hands it is doubtful if
he would have enjoyed a minute of sleep during the
absence of his enemy as a matter of fact the zerko
never visited the cavern during that period and the fleet
was never missed

  krago had no trouble in securing a crew for this vast
fleet from the ranks of the defeated militarists who wel-
comed an opportunity to aid in the realization of their
fondest dream the destruction of the remaining vudu
civilization many of his followers had come from the
criminal class others were ardent militarists who be-
lieved they were doing something great for their own
world while many were young men who joined the
expedition merely for the love of adventure it is in-
teresting to note that over one-third of the crew were of
the fair sex

downfall

the fleet of fifty invisible spheres entered the ter-
restrial atmosphere near the south pole and moved
swiftly toward the cape of good hope as the african
continent was reached the spheres scattered and moved
across the continent toward the north searching dili-
gently for the cities of the vuduites when a village
was located the invisible raiders directed a powerful
heat-ray upon it within a few minutes the inflammable

parts of the town were afire and in many cases the
stone buildings were so heated that they flowed like
molten lava the surrounding forests were always
touched with the heat-ray because they were usually full
of refugees the spheres were acting under orders to
destroy everything that could be destroyed thus wiping
out a race that was both hated and feared

  when the first city of the vuduites had been discov-
ered by the first expedition from the moon over twenty
thousand years earlier the blacks had been more than a
match for the selenites during the first war of the
worlds the vuduites had proved that they were more
efficient fighters than the raiders during the martian
war it had been demonstrated that the blacks still con-
tinued to be better fighters than the selenites and that
it was invisibility alone that had enabled nine spheres
from the moon to turn the tide of the battle after the
perfection of invisibility however each private raid had
found the blacks more defenseless during kragos war
the defense was nil the sole hope of the vuduites lay
in their efforts to escape and the selenites prevented
many of them from doing this during previous raids
the white and mixed population had been spared but
krago saw a menace in any form of barlenkozian civili-
zation he therefore determined to spare no one except
the fierce savage cave-men and he was not very par-
ticular about sparing them either throughout the afri-
can continent white villages were scattered among the
black krago did not take the trouble to inquire whether
his victims were black or white his plans called for a
complete extermination of all possible enemies

  it has been shown that the black civilization was on
decline and that many of their scientific secrets were
lost even without kragos war it is doubtful whether
or not they would ever again have become a menace to
the selenites the pacifists did not fear them but this
raid was being conducted by militarists who insisted
that the barlenkozians must be exterminated for
several days the work of exterminating the barlenkozians
progressed very nicely the little resistance that was of-
fered only amused the raiders but to a non-combatant it
was very pathetic spheres rose from several of the
doomed cities to meet their invisible enemies only to go
crashing toward the ground a few minutes later what
manner of man can fight against unknown and unseen
enemies how long could a civilization such as our own
withstand such attacks how long before our populace
would be too terror-stricken to act intelligently would
not a large proportion of our people do exactly as did
these ancient blacks and implore the only deity known to
the race to save them from the mysterious foes

  that is just what the blacks did as the news spread
that the raiders were again at work sacrifices were of-
fered to the images of their sun-god but for ages the
sun-god had failed to hear their supplications only
during the martian war had their deity helped them and
many doubtless felt that the sun-god was responsible
for their suffering consequently vudu the ancient
name of their deity was feared and hated by some tribes
and the inherited fear of voodoo a mysterious black
evil spirit still survives among many of their present day
descendants perhaps it is due to the fact that black
ideas were shared by the whites during their slavery and
probably for centuries afterwards that the fear of this
mysterious evil entity forms a part of the belief of more
enlightened people even to this day

  as the vuduite craft rose feebly against unseen foes
they were picked off by the raiders and sent crashing
to the ground the selenites were now using their dis- t
the war of

   integrating rays almost as much as the more favored
   heat-ray with the result that storms covered the entire
   continent this made the work of the raiders harder
   because their spheres were unmanageable in a severe
   storm but it also made the condition of the few blacks
   who had escaped into the jungle more miserable and
   they continued to use it whenever possible the storms
   extinguished the jungle fires caused by the heat-rays
   this pleased the raiders because the smoke often hid
   entire villages from the raiders and the fires were taking
   a heavy toll of the wild carnivores krago had no desire
   to destroy any enemies of his victims

africa in ruins

   by the time africa had been covered by the raiders
   one of the severest storms of all time was raging
   over the stricken continent during this storm the
   selenites had found safety high above the clouds and it
   is certain that many of the blacks escaped from the scene
   of the disaster in their own sphere probably they found
   safety on the australian continent far to the east in-
   asmuch as their descendants are still to be found in that
   region it is probable that their ancestors were refugees
   from africa probably during kragos war or some of
   the other raids the selenites were too busy keeping
   their own craft under control and they could not prevent
   the escape of the spheres full of black refugees

      with the destruction of the last city south of the an-
   cient sahara sea africa was in ruins a great race had
   fallen and an ancient and wondrous civilization had per-
   ished probably never again to be rebuilt the wild car-
   nivores now reigned supreme in their own natural ele-
   ment masters of their environment they had outlived
   the weaker black bipeds from another world

     throughout the vast storm-swept continent small
   groups of black refugees were seeking safety from the
   carnivores and shelter from the chilling rain under the
   trees and amid the luxuriant jungle vegetation the
   darkness of night was approaching and the day of hor-
   rors was ended the refugees could not see behind the
   clouds that continued to spill torrents of water over the
   devastated continent but they knew that the sun was
   setting the day of horrors had passed and the day of
   their great race was gone forever

      for hours the thunder continued to roll and the light-
   ning to flash from one horizon to the other while the
   chilling rains descended in torrents upon thousands of
   naked and unsheltered blacks in the comforts of mod-
   ern homes the reader can not imagine the suffering and
   terror of a small group of these pathetic figures repre-
   sentative of the survivors of the once proud and mighty
   race somewhere in the north they could hear the sound
   of an angry bull elephants trumpeting far in the south
   the roar of a lion caused the earth to tremble in the
   west a cry of mingled terror and pain told that some
   feline mistress of the jungle had found her supper

      in the trees overhead excited chattering of the rain-
   soaked monkeys told of the presence of immediate dan-
   ger a violent splashing in the nearby river swollen by
   the torrents of rain told that the crocodile-another mas-
   ter of his environment-was satisfying his hunger in
   the east the lightning continued to flash and the thunders
   to roll

      on the ground slightly protected from the fury of the
   storm by the dense vegetation a tiny mite of humanity
   was crying as his mother clasped her man-child close to
   her own ebony breast

 did this wee baby understand the significance of the

the planets	

situation did he know that the ancient glories of his
own mighty and illustrious fathers was now forever lost
did he realize that henceforth he his brothers his chil-
dren and his posterity must face the cruel forces of na-
ture as he was facing them tonight did he know that
the future existence of his race depended upon its ability
to fight claws and fangs with muscle and brawn plus that
remaining spark of something-inherited from a long
line of scientific ancestors-called intelligence which
time nature invisible raiders and the living perils of the
jungle could never wipe out

  was that the reason the sound of his wailings rivaled
the voice of the thunders and the cries of the wild mas-
ters of the jungle supreme in their own natural element
or did he cry because he was cold hungry and unshel-
tered tasting for the first time in his life the brutality
of a world of strife trouble fear and pain which was
now the common heritage of his race

 chapter xi

 kragos wife

by the most trivial of incidents many momentous
events of history have been determined a sudden
change in the weather has decided the tide of many
a battle the destiny of nations has been changed by
matters as small as a loose shoe on the foot of a horse
ridden by a famous general the geography and physi-
cal conditions of the eastern hemisphere were altered
by an incident too trivial to deserve mention the fact
that krago had brought his wife with him on an expe-
dition of war and destruction

  no doubt this seemed a perfectly natural and proper
thing to do as hundreds of kragos warriors were doing
the same thing at that time women had been given
equal rights in everything and they were making the
most of their new opportunities but the presence of
such a distinguished social personage as fisoka twin
sister of zerko haniks and wife of krago almost made
a pleasure party out of an expedition organized for war
and destruction fisoka considered herself a great help
to her husband but older men in the expedition who
were more experienced with the fair sex soon saw that
there would be difficulty in keeping the mind of their
general on his work krago had entrusted all the prob-
lems of astronautical navigation to his lieutenants and
had intended to let them command the spheres on the
vast african battle front in order that he might devote
his personal attention to the pleasure of fisoka they
were together constantly as krago instructed his sub-
ordinates and pointed out the location of known cities on
the map his wife affectionately looked over his shoulder
and offered advice that proved to be more decisive than
useful

  it is not my purpose to write a love story i would
not do it even if i knew all the details of this ancient
romance i merely record that the presence of fisoka
upon our planet decided the fate of the future geography
and history of our earth at the advice of older men
in the expedition one sphere was turned over for the 
personal use of the wife of the commander-in-chief her
sphere was not permitted to endanger its distinguished
passengers by visiting the scene of battle but radio and
television kept her informed of the progress her dis-
tinguished husband was making to avoid all possible
danger the sphere moved along the more peaceful west
coast of africa while the remainder of the fleet was
spreading death confusion and destruction among the
helpless blacks
	wonder stories quarterly

  by the time the last city south of the sahara sea was
destroyed storms of unheard-of fury were raging over
the entire continent alarmed for the safety of his wife
whose radio signals could no longer be heard on account
of the storm krago ordered the fighting to stop until the
weather had become more settled fisoka becoming
alarmed at the storms which were entirely unknown on
her own world broadcast a call for help when her sig-
nals were heard and recognized krago ordered the entire
fleet to go to her rescue

  he was overjoyed to learn that his wife had suffered
no ill effects from the storms then fisoka suggested
a celebration in honor of the victories of her husband
over the vuduites among the selenites a celebration
could be started without much excuse so it was not long
until the fleet of invisible raiders had become a fleet of
joy-makers

  meanwhile the weather had cleared and the selenites
were enjoying the beautiful barlenkozian scenery they
were very much impressed by the beauty of the sun turn-
ing to a dull red-in a sky filled with fleecy clouds-and
dropping behind the distant waters of the atlantic it
was a remarkable contrast to the sunsets of their own
world where the sun requires hours to drop the dis-
tance of his own diameter and slowly touches the bar-
ren horizon without even slightly dimming his brilliant
rays the barlenkozian twilight was very beautiful in
comparison with the sudden contrast from bright day to
the darkness of night the blue terrestrial sky was a
source of wonder to the ladies who had never before
seen anything but a sky of inky blackness filled with
countless stars even during their long day

  but it was the sunrise that most impressed krago and
his bride it was while observing a sunrise of unusual
beauty that a strange discovery was made between
the rising sun and the tiny mountain range over which
the sphere was hovering there was a vast deep valley
as fisoka turned toward the west to observe the shadows
cast by the dull morning sun she remarked to krago that
it looked as if the level of the sea was much higher than
the deep valley to the east as krago looked his eyes
confirmed her opinion but he knew that it was a scien-
tific impossibility for dry land so close to the vast sea
to be below the level of the sea what was to prevent
the waters of the sea from filling the valley it was
undoubtedly an optical illusion a trick of the strange
barlenkozian atmosphere and their eyes were being de-
ceived but fisokas feminine intuition told her that
she had made a wonderful discovery the valley was far
below the level of the atlantic

a great idea

fisoka called her friends to settle the family argu-
ment they decided unanimously in favor of
fisoka she had made a wonderful discovery krago
sent several spheres to explore the valley and ascertain
its size two days later they returned with the report
that the valley extended toward the east for a distance
believed to be greater than the diameter of their own
little world  they were unable to agree upon its exact
size but it was certain that they had seen the inland
seas around which had once existed the greatest center
of vudu civilization it was reported that parts of the
valley were still inhabited by their ancient enemies but
there were countless white settlements and in many cases
the whites appeared to be in a more enlightened con-
dition than their former masters this report aroused

krago to action he was tiring of too much idleness and
was anxious to resume his warfare and lay waste the
vast valley the invisible fleet was made ready to de-
part and as usual fisoka was to remain behind in a zone
of safety

   wouldnt it be wonderful if you didnt have to leave
me and destroy those terrible barlenkozians  fisoka
asked as krago was bidding her good-bye for what was
supposed to be the last time

  yes darling krago would answer but i have to
do my duty id much rather stay here with you than
risk my life on the field of battle

  why couldnt we cut a narrow channel from the
valley to that vast sea the water would fill the valley
and exterminate the vudus in it more easily and thor-
oughly than you could do it she asked

  a marvelous idea krago exclaimed that is just
what we shall do what a spectacular scene it will make
for you and the other ladies  why didnt i think of it
sooner

   another celebration followed the birth of this idea and
the execution of the plans followed the celebration
fisoka was given the honor of directing the first of the
heat-rays against the narrow wall that had protected the
valley from the atlantic for countless ages but ac-
cidents occurred the invisible spheres working so ex-
citedly in such close quarters were constantly getting in
the way of each other the invisibility that had pro-
tected them during the african campaign was now
against them they could not see each other and were
either colliding or getting in the way of the heat-rays
from other spheres for this reason work on the
channel stopped until the spheres were sprayed with a
substance resembling red paint after which they could
be easily seen

   the fleet of fifty spheres now began work at the ex-
treme eastern extremity of the proposed channel for
days they melted the rock and permitted it to flow down
the mountainside into the deeper parts of the valley
they were cutting a channel whose width was over a
mile at the narrowest pitch which was the place where
they had to cut through the highest part of the hills
after working for several days the channel was taking
form but the molten rock ceased to flow into the valley
their channel had become clogged and it was necessary
to begin again and cut a deeper channel through the
artificial lava that had cooled and clogged the stream
before the fiery stream of molten rock would move
away of its own free will for the second time the
work was resumed and for the second time the stream
was clogged

  the task was bigger than they had expected a
family argument took place between fisoka and the
commander-in-chief he claimed that she was re-
sponsible for his starting the impossible task to please
her he had had the spheres painted and they were no
longer invisible hence it was too dangerous to attack
the inhabitants of the valley from the air as the africans
had been attacked fisoka advanced the argument that
no one but a coward would refuse to fight unless he was
invisible and all manner of unkind words passed be-
tween the couple that had so recently been pointed out
as an example of a perfectly happy union

  of course krago was angry he declared that he
would finish the task he had started in spite of all the
women in the solar system he ordered his warriors to
use their disintegrating rays and again clean out the
channel and to use the same rays for the remainder of
the war of

the work in spite of the resulting storms and discom-
fort of the ladies hie would show a certain party that
he was not a quitter

  several times the work had to be delayed on account
of the raging storms caused by the disintegration of the
atmosphere in the path of the powerful rays at times
the spheres were almost uncontrollable and the fleet had
to retire to a higher altitude for safety the moon
traveled two and one half times around the earth while
the vast channel was being cut through the people of
the valley could have been exterminated several times
with less effort less danger and less domestic trouble
while the millions of tons of solid rock were being dis-
integrated but krago was not a quitter fisoka could
not accuse him of that i he had promised a spectacular
scene and he was not the man to disappoint expectations

chapter xii
the mediterranean is born

after cutting through die highest part of the hills
the channel was widened thus making a funnel
shaped canal with a frontage against the atlantic
of over five miles the storms were now more furious
than ever and extreme caution and skill were required on
the part of the pilots to keep the spheres in position as
the storms increased in fury the waters of the atlantic
became more impatient the waves sweeping in from
the west were of mountain height for days they bat-
tered against the now narrow wall that protected the
great valley as if anxious to enter their new domain and
accomplish their work of destruction the time was
now at hand when an occasional wave higher than the
others would reach the summit and pour over into the
nearly finished channel as the rain and occasional
waves of salt water touched the molten bottom of the
artificial channel huge clouds of steam would rise into
the air and mingle with the low rain-bearing clouds
making it almost impossible for the workers to see the
effect of their rays

  it was due to this fact that several of the disintegrat-
ing rays were directed toward the wrong place so that
before the selenites were ready the waters of the at-
lantic began to pour into the molten channel and go
thundering down the valley the channel became a
raging torrent steam produced by the heated and molten
rocks rose from the thundering waters only to con-
dense and fall as rain making the storm one of the most
severe that had ever appeared on the face of the earth

  krago had made good his promise to produce a
spectacular scene so far as fisoka was concerned it
was becoming too spectacular she was frightened by
the angry waters and forgetting the recent family argu-
ment she went to her husband for protection peace
now reigned supreme between mr and mrs krago but
the scene below them was far from being peaceful

  there was one thing that had fooled the selenites
they knew something of hydraulic pressure on their own
world but on the earth with a superior force of gravity
the hydraulic force was six times as great as that of their
own world the torrent of water rushing through the
small accidental opening soon tore away more of the
wall thus widening the opening and adding to the
strength of the swift torrent before they realized it
the forces of nature had removed more rock and soil
than their powerful disintegrating rays had done and
the floods were raging though the entire channel cutting
as they went and widening the newly-formed strait of
gibraltar

jhe planets	

  while the valley was filling the torrent continued to
widen the channel until its present dimensions were
reached and the strait had become eight miles wide at its
narrowest point once the waters of the atlantic had
started to pour into the valley nothing could stop them
the greatest catastrophe in the history of the earth had
broken loose as a monument to this event one high
rock stands to this day as a symbol of strength and en-
durance the pillar of hercules withstood the flood
under its modern name the rock of gibraltar it sup-
ports today the british fortress the key to the mediter-
ranean

  this vast torrent of water deepened the artificial chan-
nel and created a deep submarine valley which now runs
up from the mediterranean deep right through the
straits and trenching some distance out onto the at-
lantic shelf

a deluge

krago and his fleet were no longer interested in the
raging torrent of water pouring through a narrow
strait they wanted to see the results of their labors as
the basin began to fill drowning their entrapped victims
like rats in a well the entire fleet began to move to-
ward the east in the wake of the flood

  as the water left the narrow artificial channel it
spread out into a wide flood which swept everything be-
fore it hills were undermined and washed away trees
were uprooted and the splashing of the swift angry
waters produced spectacular scenes that pleased and
thrilled the selenites in their spheres high above the
flood as the flood reached the lower regions of the
valley the fury of the mad downward rush was in-
creased nothing could withstand it as it passed over
hundreds of miles of uninhabited country sweeping
hills rocks and forests before it as the angry wall of
water reached the first of the villages in the valley the
torrent instantly carried it away

  as the western levantine lake was reached the
water spread out over its surface and over the low sur-
rounding valley the wall of water had spread out over
hundreds of miles it was now no longer of mountain
height but its volume force and fury were still there
terror-stricken inhabitants began to seek the safety of
the higher hills and mountains but the threatening wa-
ters continued to rise the storm was still raging in
all its fury the lightning continued to flash and the
thunders were roaring louder than the angry torrent of
water the rain pouring from the heavens only added
to the terror and misery of the living creatures which
were making their last stand against a merciless and
unabating flood

  lions and lambs sought safety side by side the
fear of the waters had caused the sheep and cattle to
forget the dangers from the carnivores which were now
influenced more by fear than by hunger as the face
of the only world known to them was being covered by
the rising waters the creatures became more crowded
and fought for the higher places which were now covered
with every living thing that could walk fly or crawl
here a pathetic group of human beings was trying to
fight off some of the lower animals which insisted upon
sharing the only place of safety on another high rock
was a woman with her children peacefully taking re-
fuge with a tigress and her new-born kittens on an-
other sinking hill-top was a group of children probably
placed there by parents who were now drowned and
submerged by the ever-rising flood fighting for the


wonder stories quarterly

highest point with dogs that had no doubt been their
companions and guardians only a few days earlier
ancient animosities and friendships were dead and new
hatreds and friendships were born as death beckoned
from the rising waters

  preservation of the race is almost as strong an in-
stinct as preservation of self with both the human and
lower animals white men fought against black for
the temporary safety of a sinking tree-top in other
places white and black both realized the foolishness of
fighting for the privilege of being the last to be drowned
probably they did not know that the inexhaustible at-
lantic was behind the flood which would continue to
rise until their former homes were more than six thou-
sand feet below the level of the great mediterranean sea
that was now coming into being no doubt they con-
sidered it the work of an angry and avenging deity who
had sent the storm to cover the entire face of their world

kragos troubles

and like avenging deities in the safety of their
spheres high above the flood krago and his war-
riors looked down upon their handiwork and saw that it
was pleasing they laughed as they recorded in their
motion picture cameras the scenes of destruction suffer-
ing and death which they had caused for the living
creatures below to them it was a battle between science
and ignorance science was winning and the warriors
were satisfied and thrilled by the colossal spectacle

  when fisoka saw the drowning of thousands of men
women and children black and white alike her better
nature was aroused the scenes did not thrill her as
they did her militant husband instead she sym-
pathized with the victims of her own brilliant idea prob-
ably she wished she had never thought of flooding the
valley in the first place but there is no record of her
making a statement to that effect she shifted all the
blame and responsibility upon the broad shoulders of
krago he was responsible-she was innocent why
did he ever do such a horrible thing

  krago resented her attitude he refused to accept the
blame but a few moments earlier he had claimed the
credit for the thrilling spectacle fisoka knew how to
use her tongue to her own advantage and it is recorded
that she said a number of unkind things to her husband
his entire war was nothing but unnecessary murder
the peaceful inhabitants of the valley had done nothing
to justify their extermination was it really too late
could something not be done to save the helpless victims
of the flood could the spheres not take them to higher
land

  under ordinary circumstances krago would have
done anything that his wife asked but he considered her
as much to blame for the disaster as anyone so her ac-
cusations only angered him he refused to aid a single
victim fisoka had suggested flooding the valley and
he had done it to please her

  at last the waters ceased to rise the refugees man
and animal alike seemed to sense the fact that the flood
no longer menaced them despair changed to hope as
they patiently waited for the waters to recede so that
they might again wander over the peaceful valley that
had always been their home but after days of starving
and waiting it was seen that the waters were holding
their own their last stand remained the same as the
refugees watched and waited friendships bom of
fear and despair became frightful animosities as lions
devoured lambs and humans fought the lower animals

to see which should devour the other the selenites
recording every movement in their cameras knew that
the western inland sea was filled and the water was over-
flowing into the second valley

  the waters of the atlantic continued to pour in
through the enlarged channel overflowing the first basin
and filling the second the storm continued without any
promise of ever ceasing in the second valley the scenes
of destruction just described were repeated and multi-
plied krago and his warriors were satisfied with the
success of their labors while fisoka and others of her
sex were almost frantic in more recent times the pic-
tures of the flooding of this valley have caused night-
mares by the million among the more peaceful selenites

  the second basin which was the center of the re-
maining vudu civilization was much larger than the
first and consequently the waters did not tise quite so
rapidly the wall of water moving across the fertile
plains was not very high and much of its force was
spent but encouraged by the everlasting storms it
still caused the unspeakable consternation among the in-
habitants as it reached those prehistoric levantine
cities-more ancient in those days than the pyramids of
egypt are today-their crumbling foundations were
undermined and the helpless blacks found their buildings
falling in upon them just as in the other valley the
refugees sought safety in the higher hills and mountains
and as the waters continued to rise the same scenes
were re-enacted

  for days and nights the waters continued to rise and
the rain continued to descend now in a steady downpour
and again in violent cloudbursts the briny waters
would rush across the valley and batter against the eas-
tern hills only to return with more fury than ever and
meet a new wave from the west following the lines
of least resistance the combined wave would return
toward the eastern slopes and again attempt to pile up
like water splashing from one end of a bath-tub to the
other the titanic waves of the newly created sea splashed
over asia minor and the low plains of arabia

peace now reigned supreme within the fifty spheres
that hovered over the raging waters their human
cargo enjoying the colossal spectacle and taking pic-
tures to prove their story when they should return in
triumph to their native world the ladies were recon-
ciled and enjoying the thrilling scenes fisokas mood
had changed again and her anger had vanished as sud-
denly as it had been aroused krago whispered to his
warriors that he was as capable of conquering women
as he was of vanquishing his enemies but he did not
dare let his wife know that she was conquered she
would be more peaceful if she could think she was having
her own way

  but the scenes below presented a remarkable contrast
to the peaceful scenes inside the spheres the vast basin
was almost full of water and the fury of the swift
stream pouring in from the atlantic through the widened
strait of gibraltar was as violent as ever waves of
mountain height swept across the surface of the new-
born mediterranean and piled up in the highlands of
palestine and asia minor here the flood divided
half of it flowed down across the fertile plains of
arabia washing the soil away and sweeping die debris
into the indian ocean the remainder of the divided
wave returned across the storm-swept mediterranean
moving in mountain heights toward the west and lap-

a rainbow
the war of

ping against the coasts of southern france and spain
then passing through the newly formed strait of gib-
raltar back into the stormy atlantic again the wave
would return with more height and momentum than
ever followed by more water from the inexhaustible
atlantic and again pile up over asia minor another
basin was filled by the overflowing flood and the black
sea was brought into being the water from the black
sea returned in the form of another wave to the medi-
terranean only to be forced back into the black sea
as mountainous waves splashed back and forth from one
sea to the other the obstructing highlands were cut
through and the sea of marmora and the dardanelles
were formed

  it was while one of these vast waves was at its height
that the sphere carrying krago and fisoka high over the
flood was trying to determine whether the mountains in
the plateau of asia minor would prevent the flood from
reaching the caspian sea they were hoping to see the
wave cut another channel connecting the black and
caspian seas as it was doing in the dardanelles in
viewing the pictures taken from this sphere i had no
difficulty in identifying two lofty peaks towering above
the raging flood one was little ararat  feet
high and the other was greater ararat with an altitude
of  feet above the present sea level as if in con-
firmation of the earliest records of our own civilization
the chaldean and hebrew histories a strange craft was
washed ashore on the rocky slopes of greater ararat
the sun was probably three hours high in the eastern
sky and for the first time since the storm had arrived
the heavens promised to clear

  it would no doubt be well for me to pass over this
scene probably all of my readers have already recog-
nized this strange craft and many have read descriptions
of it in both sacred and profane histories at this point
i shall quote from a description given by an ancient
selenite historian which is still used in certain colleges
of the moon

  a large group of domesticated animals were to be
seen emerging from the wrecked craft probably looking
for food a small pathetic group of human refugees
inspired by their first vision of the sun in days had
made an altar of rough stones and were offering some
sort of a domestic animal as a sacrifice to their deity
we are certain that this deity was not the sun because
the backs of the worshipers were turned toward that
brilliant sphere as if in answer to their supplications
there appeared a marvelous display of colors in the
sky which seemed to extend from the clouds to the
earth just beyond their altar

  this brilliant display seemed to contain every color
known to science beautifully blended together in the
form of an arc of a circle which extended far into the
sky it was a mystery to the criminals from our peace-
ful world as such a vision had never before been seen by
our people for some time afterwards certain super-
stitious groups of our people have been inclined to con-
sider it as something supernatural but more scientific
expeditions have learned that it was a common pheno-
mena of barlenkoz

  on that giant world at unknown intervals the mois-
ture in the clouds condenses and falls to the surface of
the planet as the sun shines on the minute drops of
water in mid-air its rays are broken up into their pris-
matic colors and reflected toward the observer this
was new to krago and his band of villains who probably

	lunar days of about four terrestrial weeks were meant by the
selenite histonao-w a haverfield

the planets	

shared the belief of the primitive group of humanity
that this was a promise from their deity that the waters
would recede from that part of the world and the new
world washed forever of black supremacy would be
more desirable than it had been in the past

chapter xiii

the clash of the titans

between the two basins in the mediterranean
valley a range of mountains extended from the
north to the south this mountain range now
known as the apennines extending the full length of the
italian peninsula once extended down into the lower
regions of the valley almost connecting with the atlas
mountains in northern africa the huge waves that
swept from one end of the newly created sea to the other
swept over the highest summits of these lower mountains
the lower part of the italian peninsula was the scene of
huge torrents sweeping up out of the sea to the summits
of the high mountains and sweeping back again to the
angry waters that had flooded the lowlands

  in what is now a part of sicily there had long existed
a volcano that had probably been a source of wonder and
annoyance to the inhabitants few of the exploring ex-
peditions from the moon had ever seen this volcano in
eruption it was known to be rather peaceful though
there were times at infrequent intervals when molten
lava would flow from its- top while smoke and steam
would rise toward the sky as the angry waves of this
flood rushed up its sides and over its top the crater was
filled with water the volcano would probably have re-
mained peaceful during kragos war had it not been for
this fact but the water in the cfater found its way into
the slumbering fires far below the surface of the earth
tremendous force was developed by the steam that was
produced as the water and the fires mingled an explo-
sion followed

  the cone of the entire crater was blown away by the
force of the explosion leaving the molten interior ex-
posed to the inexhaustible supply of water from the at-
lantic as the flood rushed into the gaping red wound in
the side of mother earth the titanic forces of nature
were released and their fury threatened the destruction
of the entire world

  several spheres were in the vicinity at this time one
was destroyed by the first explosion when the entire cone
was blown to atoms from a high altitude other spheres
felt the terrific concussion which threatened to make their
craft uncontrollable they saw the waters close over
the newly made hole in the earth but only one sphere
survived when the reaction came the water refused to
stay out of the vast red wound and the fires of the in-
terior refused to be drowned two irresistible forces
had met in colossal combat

  the earth trembled as the newly produced steam tried
to escape after a long rumbling the waters were seen
to be returning from the gigantic wound their fury
increased as many cubic miles of water poured out of the
earth rising higher in the air every minute to be fol-
lowed by immense volumes of steam as the steam
ceased to emerge another supply of water rushed in fill-
ing the gaping crater the occupants of the single re-
maining sphere decided that they had seen enough spec-
tacular scenes and hurried toward the north rising to a
higher altitude at the same time but they did not have
enough speed to keep from seeing the second eruption
high into the upper regions of the rarified atmosphere


wonder stories quarterly

they saw the angry waters hurled aloft with a force that
they believed would take them beyond the earths gravi-
tational field

  the roar of the wounded and angry earth reached
them they could feel the powerful concussions as ex-
plosion followed explosion and even the clouds far below
them shared the anger and turbulence of the sea farther
below other spheres hundreds of miles away not know-
ing the cause of the disturbance or the trembling of the
earth rose above the clouds since the scenes below were
becoming too spectacular for safety mountains were
trembling and shaking mighty avalanches were produced
as countless tons of rock rolled down the mountain-sides
the waters of the sea and the clouds of the air mingled in
one vast foamy spray the bewildered selenites knew
that some titanic force of nature was at work threaten-
ing to split the earth asunder

  high above the clouds krago called the remainder of
his fleet together when he learned that the waters had
entered the crater of the old volcano thus causing a deep
wound to appear in the earth he decided that barlenkoz
was a greater menace in her wounded condition than
ever he knew that he had unknowingly released forces
far greater than any ever produced by any of his scien-

had entered steam smoke ashes and lava continued
to emerge from the terrible wound the ashes and lava
were deposited in the region surrounding the crater
building up a circular rim that would protect the fires of
the interior from the waters of the sea nature was
healing the wound in the side of the planet

  but the smoke fine ashes and thin volcanic dust were
being hurled toward the zenith a cloud of this material
was being formed in the upper atmosphere and spreading
for hundreds of miles around the surrounding country-
side surrounding the giant volcano the sea seemed to
be boiling steam was rising from the water and a closer
investigation showed that hundreds of smaller craters
had broken out on the sea bottom from which on the
one hand immense quantities of steam and lava were
pouring and into which on the other hand more water
from the sea was finding its way this was indeed the
battlefield of the titans

reshaping a continent

  about two hundred and twenty-five miles to the north
at a point on the newhjaormed italian peninsula about
midway between thetinifte and the shores of the

tific race he was in the greatest trouble of his troublousnev sea- anmwwyolcanofcre violent than any of the

life fisoka was frantic her feminine intuition told her
that barlenkoz would fly to pieces and her intuition
never failed she was positive that her husband would
not only exterminate the giant world but her own little
world as well when barlenkoz should finally go to
pieces the moon which now depended upon the gravi-
tational influence of the giant world to hold her in an
orbit would fly off oh a line tangent to her orbit into
outer space or probably into the sun itself why had
she ever forsaken her brother and joined forces with his
enemies why had she ever listened to the cowardly
krago who told her that by exterminating the menacing
world he could gain the throne for her and himself 

  inasmuch as i am not attempting to write a love story
i shall omit ninety-nine per cent of the quarrels and
arguments between the commander-in-chief and his
capricious and fickle wife but in this case he was in-
clined to believe that fisoka was right there was no
safety on either world he did not dare return to the
moon neither did he care to remain near the disrupting
planet consequently the entire fleet retired to a con-
siderable distance outside the atmosphere and continued
to watch what they thought was the death throes of the
menacing world

  from outer space it was impossible to see the surface
of the earth due to the immense clouds that still hovered
over the vicinity of the mediterranean occasionally the
clouds would part presenting a view of a red spot near
the center of the sea that he had brought into being in
other regions it was seen that volcanos had come into
being that had never been seen during the long period
that the menacing planet had been under observation

  after a long time it was noted that the earth was not
splitting asunder and for once the infallible fisoka had
been mistaken venturing closer to see what was hap-
pening he found that the new sea was now more peace-
ful the waves were no longer of mountain height and
the rain clouds had dispersed but in their place he
found a different type of cloud one that none in his
party could understand or explain the terrible wounds
in the earth were worse than ever water continued to
pour into the vast hole only to return in the form of
steam with a violence far greater than that with which it

others had broki loosi this new crater did not pour
molten lava out of the crater in a constant stream like
the craters to the south but sent showers of dry ashes
volcanic dust flames and smoke to the sky the heavier
material was falling for hundreds of miles over the land
and sea while the smoke and fine dust remained in the
upper atmosphere and continued to spread over the entire
mediterranean region

  the entire earth was trembling earthquakes were
shaking the planet to its core even on the opposite side
of the earth mountains were shaking tons of loose rocks
from their lofty summits which rolled down the steep
slopes as a mighty avalanche north of the mediter-
ranean the country seemef to be rising lakes were
drained as their bottoms rose higher than the surround-
ing countryside the low mountains were rising to
towering heights the alps were taking their present
form

  the sahara sea was leaving its bed far in the east
it had found an outlet into the nile and was draining
into the mediterranean this outlet at first a small
stream soon became a wide flood that swept over egypt
the waters from the sahara continued to come faster
and soon the nile was inadequate to carry away the
flood the sea now poured over suez and the once
fertile plains of arabia were again flooded but the bulk
of the waters followed and flooded an ancient prehistoric
river south of arabia and passed on to the indian ocean
the sandy banks of this river were washed away the
river was widened to a width of two hundred miles and
the red sea and gulf of aden were born

  krago was probably as well informed as any of his
race but there were some of the forces of nature that he
was ignorant of as water from the sea entered the
molten regions of the interior of the earth in great quan-
tities he did not know just what to expect he probably
expected the resulting steam to force the water out
through the same crater and was surprised when deep
subterranean explosions rent the crust of the earth pro-
ducing countless new volcanoes and millions of earth-
quakes he never suspected that the pressure that was
being produced would force certain parts of the surface
higher into the air and that at the same time other regions
would sink far below the level of the sea he only knew
the war of the planets



that tremendous forces were at work of whose strength
and the results that they would produce he never
dreamed

  so when the internal pressure became so tremendous
that it raised the once fertile plains of arabia high into
the air hurled the mountains of the alps to their present
heights and lifted the bottom of the vast sahara sea to
a level above the surrounding regions he was astounded
and when it was reported that the northwestern portion
of the continent was sinking below the sea his amaze-
ment knew no bounds he had released forces that he
had not known to exist 

  but so long as the earth itself did not fly to pieces
krago could consider his work a success he had no
sympathy for any of the inhabitants he had come to this
planet for no other purpose than to do his utmost toward
depopulating it the geography was changing and he
was giving himself credit for the change fisoka was
again reconciled and was the most popular person in the
expedition because it was due to her own idea that the
mediterranean was flooded in the first place she would
now be content to return home with her victorious hus-
band and demand the throne of the zerkos weak-
minded though the pacifists were thty would ill be able
to understand that there would never agalfbe any
danger of another invasiotafm the menacing nfeighjjor
world nor another imprironment withifch disastrous
results they could see that ktfo and fisoka had
saved their world and their names would go down in
history as of equal importance with the first zerko who
had saved his race from the terrors of the destruction
almost a quarter of a thousand centuries earlier

  but krago and his warriors preferred to remain and
witness the spectacular scenes on the wounded planet
the many volcanoes were a source of wonder to them
an earthquake that caused high mountains to tremble
and huge cracks to open in the earth presented scenes
that they would never again see duplicated the sink-
ing of northwestern europe and the drowning of the
primitive inhabitants the neanderthal man who the
selenites thought never did have a right to live on any
world promised delightful scenes the draining of the
sahara sea as its bottom continued to rise would be a
wonder to them for years to come the volcanoes
mountains of fire by night and mountains of smoke by
day continued to thrill them the huge clouds of smoke
ashes and volcanic dust were filling the blue sky and
changing its color to a dull gray and still there were
populated regions in india australia and china to de-
mand their attention until barlenkoz was depopulated
they would never return

again an ice age

  the selenites were fascinated by the great volume of
smoke that poured out of the newly formed craters of
aetna stromboli and vesuvius they enjoyed remain-
ing in the vicinity and watching the lava as it poured out
of the crater of aetna and built the great island of sicily
in the sea that was the result of their labors they were
elated over the spectacular scenes of vesuvius which
sent many cubic miles of ashes volcanic dust and cinders
into the sky only to fall again in vast showers over the
surrounding countryside they were thrilled as strom-
boli built up a vast cone in the sea to protect the fires of
the interior from the inrushing waters

  but krago was getting impatient he wanted to get
busy and exterminate the mixed races of india and the
few survivors of the martian war in china and aus-
tralia the mixed races must be wiped out the same as

 the black he told his warriors we have work to do
 the volcanoes will not do it for us

   no one knew it at the time but krago was soon to be
 convinced that the volcanoes would exterminate not only
 the mixed races but every living creature as well they
 gave promising indications that they would exterminate
 the earth more thoroughly than his warriors the
 smoke and volcanic dust now clouded the heavens the
 vast cloud had mingled with other clouds of dust from
 distant volcanoes and covered the entire earth no longer
 did a blazing sun reign supreme in a clear blue sky a
 dull blue orb tried its best to shine through a dull gray
 cloud of volcanic dust and warm the surface of the
 earth the numerous volcanoes that had suddenly ap-
 peared all over the earth continued to add to the density
 of the cloud of minute particles of volcanic dust in the
 upper atmosphere too light to fall to the earth and too
 heavy to drift off into outer space the moon and the
 stars could no longer be seen and the sun having turned
 to a dull blue could no longer warm the earth the
 weather had suddenly become very cold ice and snow
 now covered the ground and took the place of the
 warmer rains that had drenched the stricken planet

   the ice caps of the polar regions were creeping toward
 the equator north america was half covered with ice

 northern europe and asia were at the mercy of the ice
 but the southern portions were protected the skies
 werejjrowing darker and the rays of the sun weaker the
 volcanoes gave no promise of peace and the equatorial
 regions were chilling as fisoka finally persuaded her
 husband to trust the final extermination to the forces of
 nature and return home to receive the hero worship of
 their race and demand the throne of zerko haniks

chapter xiv
the exile of the militarists

 when kragos story was given to the public and
 the pictures of their adventures and exploits
 were shown the pacifists who now numbered
 over  of the population refused to give the warriors
 the glory they had expected they received the same re-
 ception that a party of americans would receive after
 destroying millions of lives in any peaceful foreign coun-
 try zerko haniks and the supreme council ordered the
 immediate arrest of all who took part in the depopulating
 of barlenkoz

   but krago and his warriors refused to be arrested
 he demanded the throne on the grounds that fisoka was
 the twin sister of zerko haniks and that he himself
 would make a more capable zerko than the weakling who
 now wore the crown this was the crisis for which
 zerko haniks had long been waiting he insisted that
 his original orders be enforced and the raiders be placed
 under immediate arrest krago and his followers resisted
 and a desperate battle took place which resulted in a
 victory for the militarists who now threatened to van-
 quish their enenjies on the moon as readily as they had
 vanquished the vuduites a civil war had broken loose

   since this manuscript is not intended as a history of
 the moon the details of this terrible but short war will
 be omitted sufiice it to say that krago and fisoka were
 captured early in the war and the power of the rebels
 was broken but another year passed before all the
 malefactors were captured and brought to justice they
 were given a short but fair trial before the supreme
 council there was no question of their guilt as the
 entire party not only admitted it but boasted of it after
 a lengthy deliberation the punishment was prescribed by

the tower of evil

height on height the rocky cliffs loomed a mad
jumble of purple and red and mauve here in
the remote interior of tibet even the very hills
wore fantastic colors

  up through this devils playground could be seen a
narrow path writhing its way amidst the jumble of
tinted boulders up and up it wound until at last it
plunged down into a narrow gorge cleft as by a knife
a thousand feet through

  this is the worst yet
exclaimed john dunton as
for the tenth time his
struggles started a minia-
ture landslide in the shale

i dont see how those two
bearers of mine manage to
wangle their loads over this
stuff and keep their foot-
ing good thing its near
noon and the sun overhead
so that some light gets
down here or-well what
now

  suddenly as though some
gigantic hand had thrown
an enormous screen across
the narrow top of the de-
file the dim light illumin-
ing the path vanished a
blackness enveloped
the traveler and his
two native bearers

then in the defile
there rose a moan
from an almost im-
perceptible whisper
to a crescendo
of terror un-
til the air vibrated
with the wailing of
an unspeakable ag-
ony cold it had
been at this moun-
tain height but now
an icy blast roared
down the cleft as if
a door had been
opened to some gi-
gantic refrigerator

clammy hands
plucked at dunton
tore at his arms
strove to drag him
down into the rap-
ids

  when it seemed
that human brain could no longer retain its sanity under
the impact of the tortured scream and the icy blast a
sudden silence came the wind dropped the plucking
hands ceased their efforts to drag the explorer down
the silence deepened until it seemed to have a power
of its own an uncanny silence dunton could not
even hear his own breathing nor that of his bearers
something seemed to press down on him an almost
physical weight of dread the darkness was unrelieved

  but then as he stood uncertainly in front of him



there seemed to be a faint almost insensible lightening
of the blackness was it so or were his eyes deceiving
him gradually by tje faintest of graduations the
luminescence strengthened till dunton could see float-
ing directly in front of him a distinct and glowing cloud
of light a swirling shapeless cloud of violet light
that cold violet which represents the very limit of the
visible spectrum the cloud swirled and eddied and

                             whirled atput- itself drew
                             itself together slowly un-
                             til not twenty feet before
                             dunton towered a human
                             figure of light

                          two shrieks of terror
                        behind him a rapidly di-
                        minishing rattle of shale
                        and dunton knew that his
                        dark-skinned bearers had
                        incontinently departed they
                        would take back to their
                        village still another tale of
                        horror about this mystic
                        mountain land

                         i dont wonder they
ran he thought as he
surveyed the apparition
barring the path ten feet
tall the figure stood in the
conical hat the flowing
robes the skirted
shamtabs of the
tibetan lamas the
beardless face was
sternly set in a for-
bidding scowl the
right arm hand ex-
tended was raised
in a gesture which
clearly conveyed the
message go no
further motion-
less the giant figure
stood and the eyes
the entire form in
fact seemed to
dominate the defile

  it was not in dun-
tons makeup to be
afraid many a peril
he had faced in his
adventurous years
wandering in the
strange places of the
earth but now he
trembled from some
unnamable r e v u - 
sion caused by the thing which he saw before him then
a frenzy of hate seized him drawing his automatic
he sprang forward and opened fire the sharp reports
echoed and reechoed from the cliffs but the point-blank
shots seemed to have no effect on that lama of light
still he stood there with his ominous glance his warn-
ing arm still upraised

  so thats it dunton grunted well well soon
see whether youre real or not resuming his head-
long rush dunton made straight for the figure sud-

 one of the most mysterious things to the mem-
 bers of the white race is the apparently occult
 power possessed by the hindus their ability
 to perform many so called magical tricks some of
 them astounding have been a source of wonder to
 us for years

   no doubt a great deal of their power is pure trick-
 ery but there is also a great deal of profound scien-
 tific knowledge at the basis of some whether they
 obtained their knowledge through some now extinct
 race or whether it has been slowly accumulated
 through centuries of penetration of natures secrets
 we do not know

   our authors in presenting this story are attempt-
 ing to show some of the scientific truth that may lie
 behind so-called magic the towers of evil that
 they write of do really exist in arabia as seabrook
 in his adventures in arabia so eloquently describes
 our authors have taken the facts and woven them
 into a most startling story of mystery intrigue and
 adventure
	wonder stories quarterly

denly his fierce attack was checked without warning
he had come up against an invisible but rigid barrier
he could see nothing yet ten feet before he reached
the evil image he had come up against a something that
had resisted his drive so sudden and unexpected was
the check that he was sent crashing backward onto the
shale bruised and bleeding he leaped to his feet and
again rushed forward again he met the invisible bar-
rier clubbing his automatic in his right hand and
grasping a long hunting knife in his left he hammered
frantically and cut and slashed at the nothing which
stayed him but he could not approach the object of
his wrath

into the pit

at last exhausted he paused glaring again at the
mysterious lama he saw it move for the first time
the arm was slowly descending the outstretched fingers
slowly closing down down came the arm unttt a
long forefinger pointed straight at him

  again dunton rushed forward to the attack again
he was thrown back by that invisible nothingness but
this time though he fell he did not reach the ground
he felt himself lifted into the air by the same im-
palpable being he had been so vainly battling at the
same time all power of volition left his limbs he could
not move

  like some dead leaf soaring on the bosom of the
west wind he was borne aloft straight up between the
towering walls of that narrow defile up again into the
light of day higher and higher he rose in great swoop-
ing spirals until he saw revolving far below him the
snow-capped peaks and grassy plateaus of mysterious
tibet then off like an arrow he moved toward a dis-
tant range of mountains-taller even than their brethren

  only his vision and his acute brain were alive the
powerful body of this six-foot american was as use-
less as immovable as a felled log

  but barely had he a chance to gather his senses when
he found this impetuous rush slowing far above the
range that had been its objective spiralling downward
now again the circling swoops set in below he could
see set deep amidst a ring of high and unscalable cliffs
a grassy bowl it was almost circular in shape pat-
terned with masses of flowers cut by winding paths
that centered about a white tower that tower rising
sheer three hundred feet from the gardened plain was
unlike anything his wide journeying had brought to his
view covering a circular area of a full acre soaring
high in alabaster beauty it was topped by a huge sphere
of burnished metal about one hundred feet in diameter
the glare of the suns reflection from the tremendous
ball blinded dunton but in his paralysis he could neither
turn his gaze from it nor relieve his seared eyeballs
by dropping their lids

the swift spirals brought him closer and closer in
diminishing circles to the blazing globe till at last
he hovered some hundred feet above it then like an
unfolding tulip the upper hemisphere slowly opened to
reveal a black pit within suddenly the force supporting
dunton relinquished him and like a plummet he dropped
losing consciousness with the awful rush of his fall

	 

  out of the blackness of oblivion the consciousness
of the explorer beat its way his eyes opened-opened
on a scene whose unexpectedness startled his dazed
brain to life dunton stared about him in amazement
lying on a pile of cushions of rare and costly silks

he found himself in a room whose splendor surpassed
anything he had beheld

  the circular chamber with sea-blue ceiling a full
twenty feet above him was hung with tapestries worked
in lustrous silks in threads of gold and silver encrusted
with sapphires diamonds emeralds opals and other
precious stones the floor was covered with a deep rug
whose pattern was a maze of weird imagery a low
table near him was cut from the purest crystal in a
tracery of carving such as only some oriental cellini
could have produced what could be seen of the floor
and walls was of the purest alabaster the scene was
bathed in a soft sheen of opal light from a hidden source

a vision

tentatively dunton moved an arm a leg his
muscular control had returned carefully he felt
his limbs no broken bones no bruises remained to
mark that horrible fall his traveling garments were
gone and in their place he was arrayed in robes of the
finest silk

  the american arose and stared about him no
window no door was apparent swiftly he strode to
the wall nearest him and skilfully he paced about the
chamber searching under the splendid hangings for
some means of exit an unbroken stretch of glowing
alabaster mocked him

  no chance of getting out of here he muttered as
he returned to his cushioned resting place major
blakely was right i sure did get into a mess this trip

  his thoughts turned to the inception of this journey
which had culminated thus strangely the famous
shanghai club-the grizzled english officer sitting
across the table from him the calm curling of pipe
smoke contrasting so vividly with the tales of adventure
in the far comers of the earth that the two exchanged
as they sipped their pegs

  im going into tibet next dunton had said
when i was in arabia last i heard some wild stories
about towers of evil erected in a chain around the
world from which malign influences are supposed to
radiate there is one in arabia i never got to it but
seabrook in his adventures in arabia tells of visiting
it and being shown around he didnt see much for he
was kept out of a good half of the structure the chief
tower is said to be in the interior of tibet and ive made
up my mind to have a try at finding it as i know the
language in fact im starting very shortly

  major blakely had started then very impressively had
warned him my boy keep out of that forsaken coun-
try i doubt youd ever come out alive its hellish
traveling in the first place the whole region stands on
end and then-well-queer things happen in there
he paused blew some rings of smoke watched them
fade then resumed

  i was sent in there fifteen years ago with a small
force to punish some bandits i dont like to think of
what happened-but i was the only one who got out
and when i got home my wife was dead-killed in a
midnight attack on our little home-and my little three
year old daughter-was gone i have never found out
what became of her and i dont speculate too often
afraid to dont go its the devils own land

  well ill think it over dunton had replied but his
mind was set and the majors warning merely con-
firmed his determination to penetrate the mysteries of
the forbidden land

  the american reviewed the months of toiling prog-
ress that followed the difficulties he had overcome to
the tower of evil	

assemble a sufficient number of bearers for his expedi-
tion the ominous prophecies he had received as the
caravan had proceeded from village to village dunton
had laughed at the tales of horrors which lay before him
but his men had not laughed one by one they had de-
serted until only two stalwarts had been left to enter
that narrow gorge with him and witness its terrors

  looks like there was something to those stories all
right of course it isnt magic but somebody here has
control of forces that white scientists never even
dreamed of well he thought l suppose ill be lots
wiser before im much older ive been in plenty of
tight places before and ive always found a way out
but what a story ill have to tell when next i see the
boys at the explorers club in new york meanwhile
this isnt such a bad place-but i wonder if the idea is
to starve me to death

  a soft rustle behind him and he turned like a flash-
well where did you come from 

  there set like a more gorgeous jewel in this glitter-
ing room of splendor was a girl-a white girl-a beauti-
ful white girl rippling waves of golden fire her long
hair fell about her framing a face whose loveliness sent
a thrill of pain to his heart eyes deeply blue like the
mediterranean  at midsummer small straight nose
whose nostrils shell pink quivered with her soft breath-
ing red lips with perfect lines their luscious beauty
parted to show the gleaming whiteness of her teeth she
was garmented in a single silken robe of cerulean blue
which dropped straight down from her shoulders caught
at the waist by its only ornament a thick golden rope
whose tasseled ends swung against a thin white ankle

  in her hands she held a crystal tray on which were
crystal dishes heaped with food and a tall glass whose
amber contents glowed in the opal light

  dunton leaped to his feet with a torrent of questions
who are you what is this place how did you get
in- but the lovely maiden did not speak she
straightened looked at him a moment-put an incom-
parably beautiful finger to those red lips-then as the
explorer started toward her-slipped behind a hanging
close beside her in a moment dunton had ripped the
tapestry down-nothing but the cold white alabaster
wall frantically he beat at it pushed pressed here and
there on the smooth surface sought for a nail hold he
could find not the slightest seam in the gleaming surface
no secret button no yielding panel he was imprisoned
as securely as before

  finally dunton turned to the food the maiden had
brought him thats the queerest of all-he mused as
he ate i could swear that this is the tower of evil
but theres no evil about that girl that ill stake my life
on god but shes beautiful ive never seen any one
who could hold a candle to her and yet and yet there
was something familiar about that face it haunts me
somewhere some how ive run across some one who
resembles her he pondered for a long time no
cant place it but ive never seen her before no one
could forget that beauty

  his hunger satisfied at last he lay back among his
cushions what next i wonder

chapter ii
through the wall

it was sometime later as he sat musing that dunton
suddenly lifted his head and sniffed the air a
faint subtle incense pervaded the room what was
it where had that peculiar though not unpleasant
fragrance greeted his nostrils before the answer

eluded him meanwhile the odor grew more and more
definite-a heavy sweet cloying perfume thin wisps
of vapor curled and floated round the room

  suddenly a picture formed and grew clear in his
mind china    pekin  an obscure temple on
the outskirts of the city    himself in mandarin cos-
tume disguised no foreign devil entered here on penalty
of death  the underground chamber-the priests of
the temple lying about on low couches in various stages
of exaltation-the same peculiar essence that was it
hasheesh 

  even as he recognized it the wisps of fog clouded
and billowed the room and its contents blurred the
explorer felt his mental perceptions growing hazy tho
he fought against the feeling his mind swayed and
swooned the powerful drug was numbing his senses-
he was slipping    then the fumes suddenly lifted
and cleared

  the explorer shook himself striving to clear his
fuddled brain what was coming next  too long had
he been in the east not to know that this was but the
prelude for something sinister he must be prepared
for anything now

  it came a panel noiselessly slid open in the smooth
alabaster surface of the wall revealing an opening about
a foot square dunton backed away to the opposite
wall keeping a watchful eye

  a dark mass blocked the space then floated through
into the room it poised momentarily suspended in mid
air dunton crouched in readiness determined to sell
his life dearly lie gazed intently at the floating body
it slowly took shape and form brave though he was
he fell back in horror an involuntary cry burst from
his tortured throat

  great heavens it was impossible a tiny human
being eight inches in height perfect in every lineament
floated and spun on the impalpable air even as he
stared wild-eyed the creature grew and visibly increased
in size upward it floated expanding all the while un-
til the head almost touched the ceiling by this time
the body had attained normal human dimensions it
hovered then slowly descended until the feet were
planted firmly on the floor revealing to duntons be-
wildered eyes an old old man his wizened face was
the color and texture of brown parchment seamed with
innumerable wrinkles almost out of all semblance to
human features a curving beaklike nose and bony
claw-like fingers gave the appearance of a bird of prey
hovering over its victim black beady eyes of astonish-
ing lustre and vitality protruded from that incredibly
ancient countenance surmounting all was a conical
yellow hat

  he was clad in a flowing yellow robe the costume of
a tibetan lama but it was unusual in the richness of its
ornaments and the profusion of strange characters that
covered it afterwards the explorer discovered that
these marks were mystic writings in tibetan and ancient
persian at the moment however he was too as-
tounded to take note of the details

  the ancient lama gazed at him with an air of au-
thority who are you that dare set foot in the sacred
limits of our territory where no foreigner or tibetan
has ever penetrated and what was your purpose in com-
ing here

  the explorer collected his scattered wits for a mo-
ment he hesitated then determined that frankness was
the better plan

   an intoxicating indian drug either drank or inbaled like opium
	wonder stories quarterly

               dunton is unafraid
         name is john dunton and i am an american

  ivi i am an explorer by inclination and have
ventured in strange lands over the far stretches of the
earth setting foot in many places that no white mans
foot but mine had trod before three months ago in
china i heard the legend of a strange sect that inhabited
a secluded valley in the highest reaches of theamnyi
machen range and of their still stranger practices i
determined to discover for myself the truth of this
legend

  for months i traversed the peaks and plateaus of
china and tibet until finally i came to a wild gorge
the rest no doubt you know

  yes i do the semblance of a smile found lodging
in the withered features what was done was done
at my command 

  then the lama grew stem again

  know you that by attempting to penetrate our holy
domain your life has become forfeit no living being
may enter here except on my orders and for my pur-
poses no tibetan in his right mind would come within
twenty miles of the prohibited territory yet you have
rashly dared and must pay the penalty

  the american hid his emotions behind an impassive
air not for worlds would he display even the sem-
blance of fear before this cruel cold-blooded priest
quickly his eye flashed around the room if only there
were an exit anywhere-a single bound would strangle
the ancient creature before him and then-perhaps-
escape

  but the walls were impenetrably smooth even the
little panel had slid back into position leaving no trace

  the lama smiled again he seemed to have read the
explorers thoughts

  banish any idea of escape i have ways of prevent-
ing that even should you gain the outer valley you
could not progress an inch unless i will it you have
seen enough to convince you i am possessed of more
than mortal powers by but a thought i could blast
you into eternal nothingness

  rot was the contemptuous retort i grant you
have performed some weird tricks upon me some of
them i can explain very easily for instance that figure
of light in the gorge that could easily have been done
with a magic lantern projector on a cloud mass your
spectacular entrance into my prison i attribute to a
hypnotic illusion due to hasheesh fumes only that in-
visible wall of air in the gorge and my levitation through
space i cannot explain possibly you have discovered
the principle of gravity nullification or perhaps that
too was a hypnotic illusion

  once in africa i overawed a savage tribe so that
they bowed down before me like a god before their
startled eyes i turned water into blood with a little
phenolpthalein and soap-and back again into water with
a dash of vinegar i caused the trees to speak-my
radio speaker was hidden in the leaves and as a final
touch-luck aided me with an opportune eclipse-i
darkened the sun

  your scientific wonders or illusions do not dismay
me i respect your achievements but i do not fear
them

  the lama looked at him again with keen beady eyes
then appeared to lose himself in reflection

  the americart waited tensely his racing mind seek-
ing some mode of extricating himself

  abruptly the old priest raised his head

  but you fear death he challenged

  an inner shudder traveled through dunton braye
and fearless to a fault he could not view the prospect
of immediate extinction without a qualm but out-
wardly he remained calm his captor must not be per-
mitted to sneer over his tremblings or pleas for mercy

  when it comes i shall meet it as a brave man
should he said simply

  an unwilling gleam of admiration crept into the
lamas eyes this is the man for my purposes he
muttered to himself

  then he spoke hearken carefully to what i say
should you prove the man of sense and intelligence i
take you to be you shall not only avoid the frightful
tortures already prepared for you but you shall become
possessed of power undreamt-of by mortal man for
almost a century have i toiled and perfected my plans
and now the day of accomplishment is near to-morrow
at the moment the sun rises over the mountain tops the
earth shall lie prostrate at my feet and i shall rule over
the nations and the name of lord shaitan-here he
touched his forehead devoutly with one finger-shall
once more be worshiped by the people of the earth as
in ancient wise we shall destroy mercilessly the altars
of your upstart god who too long has triumphed

the priest explains

the explorer gazed at him in growing astonishment
why the man must be mad

   but i am old-very old continued shaitans priest
and soon the day will come when i must depart to the
bosom of great shaitan who then shall continue the
great work for years have i searched for a worthy
successor all in vain these stupid lamas my under-
lings are fit only to take orders and obey them blindly
not to conceive and plan not one of them knows all
my purpose only one-a girl-has the brains i re-
quire but then-she is only a girl

   here he turned and pointed a clawlike finger at the
astounded explorer

  you-you are the very man brave intelligent re-
sourceful and possessed of a knowledge of science
cast your lot with me-become my second in command
-adopt the worship of the true lord shaitan and you
shall reign with me and alone after me no despot of
old ever had the sway that shall be mine-and yours
what say you 

  this astonishing speech had convinced dunton that
he was dealing with a fanatic he must be careful in
his replies so as not to arouse his fury besides a
glimmer of hope awoke in his breast

   what you say interests me immensely and it is also
very flattering but you have told me very little-just
what is your scheme for conquering the earth and who
is shaitan whom you worship before i come to
a decision i must know more

  the old lama nodded his head approvingly quite
right and spoken like a wise man i shall start from the
very beginning so that you may understand all i am
not afraid to reveal my plans to you either you join
me or-he paused significantly or you go where your
knowledge will be of no value to you

  he paused then continued know then that almost
a thousand years ago in the land of persia when the
religion of the false mohammed ruled the earth my
ancestor hassan ibn sabbah founded the society of
hashishin or assassins he pretended to follow mo-
hammed but in realty he formed his society to worship
the only true lord shaitan-known to you as satan
uncounted ages before shaitan ruled the world and
the tower of evil	

evil-the precious principle of evil-flourished tri-
umphant then the traitorous god-incarnation of the
womanish good-by low stratagems overthrew the
rightful lord since then shaitan has languished in
darkness only our company kept his worship alive
through the ages but to-morrow the minds of the peo-
ple shall turn to the evil once again and shaitan shall
once more come into his own

  my ancestor hassan he continued was the su-
preme chieftain he was the sheik-al-jabal-known to

sou westerners as the old man of the mountains
y means of hasheesh he enrolled a band of young
men-the fedais-from whom the blindest obedience
was exacted on them the religion of islam was en-
forced to the scorn of our initiate by secret assassina-
tion by cord and steel those blind tools spread die
power of shaitan unwittingly

  for several hundred years the society grew and
flourished until the fatal day when hulagu the tatar
accursed be his name smote down our brethren by the
thousands and destroyed their mountain citadel ala-
mut

  dunton listened in absorption he had heard of that
strange ancient sect of the assassins

  fortunately a few of the initiate headed by hassan
the youthful son of rukneddin the then sheik managed
to cut their way through the ring of their enemies for
years the devoted band wandered over the face of the
earth-outcasts-their hands against the world and the
worlds against them faithfully they kept alive the holy
spark of shaitan in a world given over to false gods

  after many years of traveling in strange lands the
hashishin came to the roof of the world-this high
mountain region of tibet so like their former fastness
in the mountains of persia here they decided to halt
and found anew the society

  in this very valley they settled conforming to
ancient practice outwardly they adopted the prevalent
faith of buddhism and lamaism while secretly prac-
ticing the holy rites of shaitan through magical
means a ring of prohibition was placed about this val-
ley that no one has ever penetrated

  he smiled an evil smile they worked in secret and
utilized the prevalent beliefs for their own ends about
the year  our then sheik-al-jabal seized the power
in tibet for a sect he organized under the name of
geluba to this day lamaism is insidiously im-
pregnated with our doctrines and so unknowingly the
tibetans do honor to lord shaitan

             chapter iii
             new wonders

by this time the explorer was listening with grow-
ing fascination was this mad old priest telling
the truth or not was there in reality this devils
cult and was it about to spread its pernicious tentacles
over the world 

  triumphantly the old priest continued his marvelous
tale

  from the very beginning the hashishin had de-
termined to bring the world once more to the altars of
shaitan and to that they bent all their energies magic
in all its aspects was studied by the initiate until now
we are adepts at the black art the marvels of the
hindu fakirs are but childs play to what we can do
my entrance to this cell was but an elementary example
of our art

  early in my youth i devoted myself to a close study
of the processes of nature for through the subjugation

of natural forces rather than through magical processes
did i foresee our chance to bring the world to the wor-
ship and gospel of evil

  years of study and experimenting and the secrets of
nature unrolled before me i discovered among other
things how to control and direct the minds of men to
the uttermost ends of the earth he interrupted him-
self but you shall see for yourself

  with that he clapped his hands a door slid open
silently in a hitherto unbroken wall immediately two
guards stepped into the cell and salaamed deeply be-
fore the old lama powerful brutes they were features
decidedly mongoloid with close cropped bullet heads
wicked looking scimitars dangling from the girdles of
their maroon colored robes

  a few staccato commands in tibetan and the guards
salaamed again then placed themselves on either side
of the american follow me beckoned the priest
and glided through the door dunton was pushed after
him into a long narrow passageway through which a
soft yellowish glow was diffused though he could dis-
cern no source of the illumination but what was more
surprising-the passage was not level-on the contrary
it slanted upwards steeply at a grade of over forty-five
degrees for about fifty feet then spiralled sharply out
of sight

  dunton stared in wonderment only with the greatest
exertion could they climb that steep slope are we to
go that way he asked

  yes answered the high priest smiling at his cap-
tives puzzled look just another of my inventions
watch

  with that he pressed a button inconspicuously im-
bedded in the wall a faint moaning sound filled the
corridor like the noise of wind in trees it grew in
intensity to a high pitched whine and suddenly the
american felt himself lifted off his feet an invisible
force was propelling him up through the winding
passageway in front of him soared the lama and on
either side floated a guard around and around they
spiralled almost interminably at about two hundred
feet up the whine ceased abruptly and they were de-
posited once more on the solid floor this must be
the top of the tower thought dunton

  above them a door opened noiselessly and a white
brilliance flooding the hall caused him to blink for a
moment then the group rose again lifted by the
mysterious force into a vast circular domed chamber

  the vault of the dome he saw was fifty feet in height
on its concave surface was painted the huge form of
shaitan-dark forbidding goat horned and goat
bearded cloven hoofs protruded from a richly em-
blazoned robe and a huge forked tail wound its way
over the face of the dome he was seated on a golden
throne in one hand he grasped firmly a writhing three-
headed serpent each head bearing a golden crown from
the other hand with outstretched palm downward
jagged lightnings darted and gleamed

  below his cloven feet were depicted a multitude of
figures human in form and semblance yet with a hideous
aura of evil about them the indescribable horror of
what he saw depicted there utterly unnerved dunton
good god can such monstrous things be he shud-
dered not daring to look again

the girl again

when he had somewhat regained his composure
he looked about him at one side was a huge
instrument board covered with switches metallic but-
	wonder stories quarterly

tons and tiny lights flashing intermittently-red yel-
low blue and orange next to it was a huge white
screen of the type used in motion picture projection
in front of it a platform that moved and swayed was
imbedded in the floor at the far end of the dome a
lacquered partition cut off from observation a sizable
area from within could be heard a confused hum
faint crackles and the peculiar odor of ozone pervaded
the air

   the place was a hive of activity men garmented in
the red robes of tibetan lamas were streaming in and
out of the door leading through the lacquer wall low
voiced orders were given in a tongue unknown to the
explorer though their dress was tibetan these men
had not the characteristic mongol features of the native
tibetans or of his escorting guards their faces re-
sembled in aquilinity and high breeding those of the oid
high priest dunton puzzled over it for a moment
then the solution came to him these were persians
far from their native mountains-relics of an ancient
race

  see you this tower gloated the lama to dunton
it is from here that the world and the nations thereof
will be conquered 

   dunton stared at him skeptically he had seen enough
to convince him of the power of these hashishin but
this was too fantastic too unbelievable

  but how he queried so far jwu have not shown
me anything all i see here is just what i could find
in any well appointed electrical laboratory when you
boast of subduing the world from this place that is ask-
ing me to believe too much you will have to explain
considerably

  the old man laughed harshly

  you doubt my power it would be well for you
to believe and bow your head hearken-

  the deep tones of a gong interrupted him as the
brazen reverberations died away the lamas ceased their
labors the priest nodded his head

  ah yes-it is the time for the grand ceremonial
he turned to dunton to-night we celebrate the
nativity of our lord shaitan you shall witness it
then you will believe in his omnipotence and in our
powers as the servants of his most evil spirit

  take him back to his chamber he commanded the
guards and when the ritual commences bring him intcf
the garden of paradise to view the holy rites but see
you guard him closely if he escapes your lives shall
pay for it go

  once more the guards ranged themselves on either
side of dunton and moved him to the door of the spiral
passageway one pressed a button and the three were
lifted from the floor floating swiftly down the twisting
corridor back to the oriental chamber there the ex-
plorer was unceremoniously deposited the walls closed
and he was alone again

   the astounding events of the past hours together with
the even more astounding tale of the priest of the devil
whirled through his exhausted mind in a nightmare
and that maiden-was she real too or some hypnotic
vision he lay back on his cushions to try to straighten
out his maze of thoughts-but somehow his mind re-
turned continually to file girl

   minutes later a sound roused him a panel slid open
and there appeared again the girl of his thoughts there
was no doubt about it-she was real living flesh and
blood bearing food on the crystal tray dunton forgot
the lama and his strange story-his eyes feasted on her

beautiful form she was even more lovely than at her
first appearance

  she felt his gaze upon her and a rosy flush came to
her cheeks timidly she looked at him was there
pity in that glance was that a tear starting from the
blue of her eye he started forward hastily she set
down the tray and like a startled fawn fled from the
room the tapestry swung back into position and thq
too ardent explorer was brought up against the blank
wall

into the garden

absently he ate the strange foods on the tray
the warm emotions he was experiencing left no
room for any other sensations who was this white
maiden so english in appearance what was she doing in
this hellish place how explain the mystery of her
presence and again there occurred to him the vague
familiarity of her adorable countenance-somewhere he
had seen features resembling hers-a crude likeness as
it were

  but the explorer was soon aroused from his romantic
thoughts again the two guards stood before him in
his absorption he had not seen or heard their entry
obediently he followed them through an aperture that
had not been disclosed before for some time they
stumbled through a long low dark tunnel dripping with
moisture

  a breath of warm perfumed air caressed duntons
cheek and the next moment he was out in the open
involuntarily a cry of delight broke from him the
garden of paradise a veritable eden never in all
his adventurous career had he seen anything to compare
with the luxuriousness the indescribable glories of this
spot no wonder the original fedai-band of sworn
assassins-met death gladly if this was their foretaste
of the paradise to come

  before him stretched a vast garden bathed in a golden
glow its source unseen it was night and the velvet
black sky was studded with brilliants patterned clus-
ters of rare and exotic blooms grew in profusion yield-
ing soft perfumes and closely intermingled was the
familiarly drowsy incense of hasheesh strange soft
music tinkled and strummed from invisible musicians-
oriental and sensuous-conjuring visions of harem
beauties

  finely carved tables were scattered around bearing
heaped fruits-dishes of luscious dates ripe red pome-
granates golden oranges and bursting tender figs
flanked by crystal goblets filled with amber liquor long
low divans were near each table gorgeously damasked
and strewn with silken scarves and cushions

  on the divans lolled a multitude of men clad in im-
maculate white robes dunton walked down a flower
lined path toward the reclining figures closely followed
by the maroon guards as he approached the ban-
queters they turned lustreless disinterested eyes on him
then returned lazily to their feasting

  the first glimpse however was sufficient to bring
dunton up short with an exclamation of amazement
of all the surprising sights he had witnessed in this
crowded day and night this was the strangest these
men were not tibetans they were not orientals-they
were caucasians here reposed a tall ruddy faced
englishman next him sat a bearded frenchman on
the other side sprawled an olive skinned italian all
about was a polyglot assemblage-all the races of the
earth were represented in this tibetan garden-
russians germans big boned swedes slant-eyed china-
the tower of evil	

men grave arabs swarthy malays giant nubians and
even-several unmistakable americans

  what lent an air of utter unreality to the scene was
the dullness of their eyes the pallor of their faces the
set looks of automatons though they were feasting
there was no sound of revelry or merriment they ate
in silence with stiff mechanical movements no one spoke
to his neighbor or seemed aware of his presence there
was something sinister about these men dunton
shivered as though a cold blast had struck his heart a
pall of evil-some mighty enchantment-seemed laid on
this company and for a moment the adventurer was
afraid-horribly afraid

  he had no time to investigate further his warders
prodded him motioning for him to proceed down
scented paths they moved a figure darted across an
intersecting path his heart gave a quick leap as he
recognized the girl of his dreams she favored him
with a side glance that thrilled him and then disappeared
down a shaded lane

  dunton found himself now on a level grassy area
about a hundred yards across on one side squatted a
row of red clad lamas on the other an orange hued
row and facing him from the farther end was stiffly
drawn up a platoon of maroon guards scimitars flash-
ing in their hands from behind dunton came slowly
desultorily the band of banqueters who ranged them-
selves irregularily to complete the fourth side of the
open square dunton was pushed into a front row
where he was compelled to seat himself guarded as be-
fore

chapter iv
the dancfe of evil

ijor a while there was silence-even the strains of
i distant music ceased a hush of anticipation set-
tled on the assembled throng-even the ranks of
the polyglots rustled with faintly aroused interest

  the thick silence was shattered by an ear-splitting
blast then a wailing rushing sound of strange tonalities
unlike anything dunton had ever heard before then
through an opening in the farther end of the square
marched slowly and solemnly a weird procession ten
demons garbed in short blood-red gowns distorted masks
covering their faces representing monkeys jackals vul-
tures and pigs wooden helmets surmounted by red flags
on their heads wristlets anklets and necklaces of tiny
human bones in one hand each carried a trumpet
made of a hollow human thigh bone on which they blew
concerted blasts in the other each brandished the pur-
bu a dagger like weapon from each girdle hung an
apron of tanned human skin

  duntons flesh prickled with horror but he could not
remove his eyes from the diabolic scene he watched
with a sickening fascination

  the demons marched into the center of the square
where they halted in line blowing a final blast on their
frightful trumpets

  there followed them a group of graveyard ghouls
dressed as skeletons eight monkey masks clad in red
and armed with bows accompanied by eight devils
wives they carried tiny drums made of human skulls
over which were spread human skins the drum sticks
were small snakes immobile when used to strike the
drums at other times they arched and wriggled rhyth-
mically in the air

  the groups ranged themselves in serried rows on the
fields and commenced a high pitched blood-curdling
chant to the accompaniment of the trumpets and drums

  the chant rose to a wail as six masked demons stepped
slowly into the field bearing on their shoulders a silken
shield seated crosslegged thereon was the figure of a
girl robed in purest white hands outstretched head
thrown back

  dunton jumped to his feet in incredulous horror
the girl again here among these fiends with a
shout he sprang forward flaming anger blurred his
vision he had only one idea-to scatter those loath-
some demons and rescue her after that he neither
knew nor cared what would happen

  but the burly guards threw themselves upon him
and bore him to the ground he struggled in their iron
grips until finally the point of a scimitar prodded into
his side brought him to his senses it was the veriest
madness he realized he must wait until a more favor-
able occasion arose quietly he sat between his scowling
captors arms pinioned inwardly raging

  the girl-goddess was seemingly unaware of the com-
motion she had aroused as she was borne around the
grassy plain her face was set and rigid her eyes gazed
straight ahead with a fixed hypnotic stare

  the chant increased in volume eight bird-masked
demons bore aloft a low throne of gold on which was
seated the high priest of shaitan he was clad in a
richly embroidered robe inset with precious stones in
one hand he carried a trident on the prongs of which
were impaled three human heads and in the other a
purbu ruby encrusted

a maddening scene

the chant ceased a pause then the very heavens
were split with a hideous clamor in came ten
devils homed hoofed tailed and ringleted with human
bones bearing aloft a high throne dazzling with the
sparkle of innumerable gems seated thereon was a
huge figure-shaitan himself-the incarnation of pure
evil a necklace dangled to its breast-of freshly tom
bleeding human hearts a huge cobra writhed and
twisted in its clammy grip against his better judg-
ment against his very reason dunton knew the malign
thing to be alive

  shaitan was placed in the center of the field on the
right hand his high priest was set at a respectful dis-
tance  on his left the girl-goddess

  dunton clenched his hands until the finger nails
pierced his palms but made no outward sign god in
heaven what could he do he coldly determined
that at the first sign of any harm to the girl he would
seize a scimitar from an unsuspecting guard and fling
himself upon those devils slaying until the end he
had no illusions about that end but strangely he felt
no qualms a fierce elation buoyed him the lust of
battle sang in his veins

  a red lama arose and encircled the figure of shaitan
strewing a powder on the ground as he did so im-
mediately a ring of flame sprang up then he walked in
a great circle enclosing all three strewing powder and
muttering an unintelligible incantation another flam-
ing circle concentric with the lesser one leapt into being
this is a scene otft of hell thought dunton

  then commenced a slow rolling of the drums the
animal masks came forward threw themselves upon the
ground grovelling before the satanic image and then
arose they commenced a slow weaving dance in which
group by group the whole host of demons joined until
they completely surrounded the fiery circle a weird
unearthly chant rose and fell the trumpets sounded
slowly at first then faster and faster danced the de-
	wonder stories quarterly

monte crew louder and louder shrieked the trumpets
more and more rapidly beat the drums higher and
higher rose the chant until finally the circle of dancers
ran and spun and whirled with inconceivable rapidity
and the frightful noise reached an unbearable pitch
the sweetish odor of hasheesh impregnated the air
dunton felt his senses swooning-the leaping figures
blurred before him

  he shook his head to clear his brain and looked again
what was this the circling demons were rising from
the ground spinning and weaving higher and higher
into the air they rose-robes masks ornaments in one
vast whirlpool of spinning color from the whirling
mass dropped the graveyard ghouls trailing spectral
light as they touched the earth the ground yawned
and they sank out of sight a moment later they
popped up into the air to join the spinning crew with
lightning rapidity they rose and fell rose and fell so
that the air was full of shooting figures and the airy
crew whirled and spun dancing on nothing dunton
felt his mind giving way-the whole phantasmagoria be-
came a huge kaleidoscope of demoniac figures and daz-
zling colors huger and huger it grew-until it ex-
ploded in a shower of sparks like a great roman candle

chapter v
the great threat

when dunton came to a deathly quiet prevailed
the masked demons were gone vanished with-
out a trace only the flaming rings and the three
throned figures they enclosed reminded the explorer
that the whole had not been a nightmare

  the high priest was speaking slowly he salaamed
to the bestial figure of shaitan then straightened

  hashishin initiates brethren of our holy faith all
is in readiness tomorrow as the sun gilds the top of
yonder mountain the earth and its inhabitants shall bow
in worship of most high shaitan lord of the nether
lands and of all that creep or swim or fly once more
shall his ancient majesty be renewed and that god who
wrested dominion from him shall retreat in terror to the
outer bounds of space for fifty years i toiled in secret
and now through the grace of shaitan the means have
been perfected see our great tower-and he pointed

  dunton turned around and saw a half mile to the
rear the huge alabaster tower rearing its white height
above the fragrant gardens it swam in the golden glow
surmounted by the huge metallic ball innumerable little
flashes of white light played over its surface

  from yonder tower the priest of evil exulted
and from its brother towers at dawn shall flash the
emanations that shall bend the proud and stiff necked
people to our will-slaves to do our bidding and the
bidding of our lord

  was it a fantasy or did the american actually see the
gleam of satisfaction in shaitans terrible eyes and the
slight nodding of the head

  and i- here the old man cast a haughty glance at
the assemblage and i shall be the vicar of our lord
on earth not to be disobeyed on penalty of immediate ex-
tinction

  and you-my brethren he turned to the red lamas
shall once more resume the ministry of evil and tend
the altars and the sacrificial offerings the burnt flesh
shall be as incense to your senses

  ho slaves he shouted in a terrible voice and shoot
his trident

  the alien company surrounding dunton stirred and

rose with the drugged movements of somnambulists
they moved forward eyes fixed and staring

  heavens how uncanny they are thought the ex-
plorer with mingled feelings of pity and repulsion
they look as though their souls have been removed and
only the tenantless bodies remained

  the old man gazed on them with hideous glee

  these wretched things were brought here from the
four corners of the globe to do our will already have
they been subjected to the secret emanations tonight
they shall be transported back to their native lands and
to-morrow when our spells are cast like nets over the
earth they shall raise their voices like roaring bulls and
lead the stricken hordes to the altars of shaitan now
set up in secret places when their task is done they
shall furnish the first bloody sacrifice to appease the
nostrils of our lord

  again it seemed to duntons fascinated vision that
the idol leered at him his brain reeled with the horror
of it all but he was worse than helpless god he
prayed inwardly grant me the means to rid the earth
of this nightmare crew

  the priest rose from his throne and pointed the
trident at the glowing ball atop the tower throwing
back his head he intoned an incantation the flicker-
ing lights grew in intensity then the ball began to
rotate throwing out innumerable streamers of light
like huge searchlights they swept the heavens sud-
denly they swooped down to earth and to duntons
amazement each ray fastened on one of the slaves and
slid up into space again with the man dangling at its
tip the rays whirled to the four points of the com-
pss the unfortunate men were shot along the beams
in all directions faster-faster they moved huge birds
that grew ever smaller with the speed of their flight
then they passed over the surrounding mountain walls
and vanished

   for the first time in his life the brave adventurer felt
blind panic sweep through him with a mighty effort
he crushed down the hysteria within him and turned to
the three figures

  even as he turned he caught a glimpse of the girl he
loved fading out into thin mist leaving a blank shield to
his startled view an exclamation rose to his lips and
he started to his feet but the vigilant guards pinioned
him before the movement was completed

the priest confesses

a ray of light darted down to the throne of the
high priest the ancient one seated himself on
the broad beam and promptly floated up the shining
path up to the tower dome that opened to receive its
master

  the throne of shaitan rose slowly and perpendicular-
ly into the air a green radiance enveloped the ghastly
figure upward it flew until it seemed a tiny ball of
green fire and then it mingled indistinguishably with
the stars

  the red lamas arose and vanished into the maze of
paths dunton was alone with his escort for a mo-
ment the wild hope of a sudden dash for lilerty rose in
his bosom but the point of a scimitar pricking his side
convinced him the time was not yet

  what do you want now he spoke angrily

  the impassive oriental gestured for him to move
ahead significantly twirling his weapon back to the
tower they went the smooth white wall opened at
their approach and they stepped into what seemed the
bottom of a deep well from the orifice high overhead
the tower of evil	

came a faint gleam even as they strode to the center
they were lifted straight up up they floated and out
of the opening into a small room through a door the
mongols pushed the american and once more he found
himself in the interior of the dome

  there sat sheik-al-jabal attired in the yellow lamas
robe in which dunton had first encountered him-as
though the whole devils scene in the garden had been a
dream this time the lama was alone

  again dunton looked about the vast hall lighted now
with a green glow that lent to all its apparatus a spectral
appearance the buzz of activity was absent only the
lama was there in the wide circlfeof this domed chamber
the old assassin was seated directly before the white
screen on an ebony throne over whose surface writhed
all the evil forms he had but now beheld

  the american made a quick movement forward as if
to attack the weazened disciple of evil but the lama
raised his hand stop you should know my power
by now stand there before me on that platform
dunton reluctantly obeyed as he stepped on the
platform itsswaying ceased but he could feel beneath
his feet a steady vibration as of some powerful electric
force barely held in check

  hearken satans high priest began and ponder
carefully you have seen our holy ritual you have wit-
nessed the mystic wonders at my command you have
beheld the coming of our lord shaitan you know
now how i his humble servant can summon and com-
mand men of every race and clime this mighty power
is yours to take and wield if you but say the word say
but that you are convinced bow down in subjection to
our lord shaitan and while i live you shall be my
sword and my hand join our mighty sect and when
shaitan at last deems me worthy of rest you shall fol-
low me as his vicar on earth you shall be the sheik-al-
jabal of a world remade for evil with but a single
word you can take for your own the earth and the ful-
ness thereof deny shaitan now and you shall die the
death of a thousand needles the death so horrible
that even shaitan himself shudders at the very thought
the american drew himself up proudly old man
he said what superstitious mongol do you think you
have here that you would have me believe these mum-
meries to be occult power you have great power but
the wonders you have shown me come not from any
supernatural cause but from a mastery of natural
forces if you would have me cast my lot with you
cast aside this puppet play of devil worship in which
neither i nor you believe show me the inner workings
of these marvels and then perhaps i shall accede to
your demand

  again an involuntary gleam of admiration flitted
across the seamed and evil visage

  so be it i see it is useless to pretend any further
with you i believe no more in shaitan than in any other
god but the fiction had its uses he arose and
descended from the ebony throne come with me be-
hind the screen and you shall see the source of my
power the great machine with which i shall sway the
minds of all men to my will he led the way through
the door in the lacquered screen and dunton followed

the secret of power

at the threshold the explorer halted in amazement
the entire space almost half the vast circle of
the hemisphere was filled with a maze of glittering ap-
paratus on a giant scale vast coils of gleaming copper
to which ran cables thicker than a mans arm tubes

ten feet high with elements like steel bridge-structures
circular rheostats like the twenty-foot constrictors of
the amazonian wilds variable condensers with brob-
dignagian plates it was as though two natives of gul-
livers lilliput had wandered into the interior of a com-
plex modern radio set

  gradually the chaotic mass of apparatus took on some
order to duntons bewildered gaze there appeared to
be two distinct groups to each of which ran huge con-
ductors from a gigantic distributor board at one end of
the space on whch the gleaming bus-bar bulked like
copper girders each apparatus was fitted with a motor
to actuate its members in the opposite end of the space
a motor-generator transformer hummed

  duntons attention focussed on the great tubes only
one of which showed by its light that it was active
they were like yet unlike the familiar radio tubes he
had so often handled

  the priest was speaking after long nights of study
i wrested from nature the secrets which here you see
made incarnate there are only two essential discoveries
which are the basis of my power the first is this

  as you must know the flashing to and fro of im-
pulses in the nerve system of the human frame bears a
marked similarity to the shuttling of power light and
sound over electric conductors my researches revealed
to me that the analogy is a true one-that from brain
through nerve to muscle from sense organ through
nerve to brain reports and commands flash as flash the
impulses of electrical vibrations to and fro over the net-
work of a modern city the only real difference is in
the character of the vibration i found the peculiar
frequency and then it was a simple matter to construct
apparatus to reproduce it once this was done the next
step followed-that by impinging a beam of my vibrator
on any individual or by spreading a fan of these radia-
tions over a group or a nation i could control to a
limited extent their thoughts or nervous processes i
found that i could make them evil or good throw them
into a panic of fear make them belligerent and warlike
or spread a flame of revolt and anarchy through a state
or a nation it was my experimentation which caused
the revolution in russia the civil war in china the
wave of murder and crime now sweeping your own
country

  my next problem was one of transportation when
i was ready to grasp the mastery of the world i needed
to be able to bring here and send back to their posts
almost instantaneously these chosen men many more
years of study and thought and i solved that problem
i was led to consider the nature of gravitation the
attraction of one body for another here too i found an
analogy to a known science that of electro-magnetism
gravity i found was a magnetism akin to but not
quite the same as electro-magnetism following out
the analogy i found that i could cause the earth to
repel rather than attract an individual i also became
able to regulate the strength of the repulsion i e the
height to which an individual would levitate

  then i evolved a method by which i could make
that person fly at any speed i willed to this tower
by a mere reversal of the process naturally i could
send my subjects to anywhere on earth i willed

  this second discovery of mine had minor uses by
a system of crossing and intersecting beams of gravito-
magnetic force i could erect an invisible and impalpable
screen of repulsion anywhere i chose a screen through
which nothing whether bullet or being could pass a
grim smile appeared on the lamas visage you have
	wonder stories quarterly

good reason i believe to appreciate the efficacy of that
device the electric energy i need is produced in a giant
powerhouse operated by a thousand-foot waterfall about
ten miles distant

chapter vi
trapped

dunton thought of the battle in the gorge and
grinned so thats how it was done pretty useful
trick ill say

  i need not the lama resumed weary you further
you have guessed at the secrets of some of my more
theatrical effects mass-hynotism stereopticon and other
childish but useful devices which have come down
through the ages utilized by the fakirs of india and the
tricksters of every land to mystify and delude the credu-
lous

  he turned and led the way to the massive control
board in the outer room here is the brain of my net-
work of control i early found that each race had a
slightly different range of nerve-vibration and so i
established seven towers six of them smaller replicas
of this in seven lands arabia manchuria russia
mexico brazil and abyssinia each have a tower of
evil the nerve-radiations emanating from here are
slightly transformed and re-broadcast for the races dom-
inant in the territory roundabout these six switches
or this master switch alternatively control this process
to-morrow at dawn when i swing down this switch
my dreams will at last come true after long years i
shall control the world rebellion and anarchy in every
land will overthrow the prating womanish rulers and
set up my rule instead

  my chosen slaves whom you saw today will dom-
inate each his land in fealty to me seven days will
suffice to make the great change then will i reverse
this other master switch and my deputies will flock
back to these holy precincts shaitan will come again
and we shall celebrate our triumph

  with you it rests whether you will celebrate that
triumph with me or die in dreadful agony stand now
again on the audience platform while i ascend my
throne ponder well your answer then i shall receive
it the night grows late and i am aweary i must need
rest for tomorrows work

  dunton stepped again on the platform that ceased its
swaying and faced the throne to which the aged lama
had again ascended the explorers head was in a whirl
he knew now that a very real a very terrible danger
menaced the unsuspecting world he knew too that
only he could save civilization from a holocaust of evil
this mad priest would keep his word to the very letter
open defiance could only be a futile gesture what
then he had better pretend to comply pretend to be
convinced then tomorrow as trusted aide of this mad-
man he would watch his chance

  yes thats it he thought go slow lull him into
unwariness then ill get my two hands around that
skinny throat and-

  great priest he raised his hand in salutation i am
convinced your power is greater far than any man
has yet attained i shall be glad to join and work with
you from now on i am yours to command

  the old priests reception of this speech which seemed
to be so complete a victory for him was astounding
his face grew livid his claw-hands were extended in
trembling rage liar he shouted fool do you dare
to mock me do you dream to deceive me look be-
hind you fool

  dunton in consternation whirled about on the
screen behind him he saw-himself with his hands
clasped about the throat of the lama dumbfounded he
stepped back-as he left the platform the screen went
blank

  fool the old man was still shrieking did you think
i would bare to you all my secrets  that platform that
screen form my thought reading device every secret
thought of him who stands there is pictured in vivid
pantomime on that screen and you thought to deceive
me

  laughter filled the great hemisphere the lama
clapped his hands two maroon guards rushed in and
seized the american take him away he dies to-
morrow

  no-wait john dunton i have changed my mind
you shall die the slow death of a thousand needles
to the lowest dungeon with him to await his end

  struggling vaintly the american was unceremoni-
ously pushed to the well and floated down to the main
hall there one of the guards pressed another button
and a black seemingly bottomless pit yawned in front
of him into this he was pushed as he staggered over
the verge he caught a fleeting glimpse of the girl just
entering the hall a glimpse of horror depicted on her
beautiful face-and he was precipitated into the yawn-
ing pit down-down into emptiness 

the death of a thousand needles

for what seemed an interminable distance he fell
and just as his nerves were snapping from the im-
minent crash his flight was suddenly checked and cush-
ioned and he was deposited slowly on the ground

  well this looks like the old man means business
dunton muttered as he looked about the cell in which
he found himself a dim phosphorescence came from
the decaying filth about and revealed a noisome cham-
ber whose rough stone walls were black with shiny
moisture and whose floor was covered with rotting
debris walls and floors were alive with pale crawling
creatures of decay

  god id like to have that mad apostle of evil at
my pistols end what a hell the world will be when
he is master of it

  back and forth back and forth he paced tramping
a path through the foul ordure one wild scheme for
escape after another passed through his tortured brain
only to be despairingly rejected as their utter futility
was quickly revealed black despair oppressed him
but all his planning all his despair could not keep his
thoughts from returning always to the girl the beauti-
ful jewel in this foul setting

  and so the long night through the prisoner paced
back and forth in his narrow cell sleep was an impos-
sibility what with the filth of the dungeon and the tor-
turings of his reeling brain the silence was broken
only by the squidge squidge of duntons steps through
the slime

  what seemed many hours dragged slowly past then
startlingly the american heard a sharp grating as of
stone on stone behind him fists clenched the american
whirled but no human antagonist met his startled eye
instead from the walls now protruded long needles
gleaming sinister the death of a thousand needles
the mad lamas phrase flashed into his mind a thousand
needles indeed aye more than a thousand surrounded
him on every hand

  but wait no need for panic as long as he remained
away from the bristling walls he was safe did the old
the tower of evil



devil expect him to rush headlong upon the point he
laughed aloud in relief

  again the grating of stone upon stone smote his ears
what was this a moment ago there had been an
irregular smear at the base of the wall before him it
was gone from wall to wall his glance darted the
space seemed smaller or did his eyes deceive him
swiftly he paced the distance a long moment he
waited while the ominous rasping continued again
he measured the distance between the imprisoning walls
an icy hand closed about his heart they were closer
together slowly imperceptibly the bristling ranks of
needles were approaching each other inexorably a hor-
rible death was closing in on him

  then indeed dunton gave up all hope the devil
the inhuman monster even the inquisition had no hor-
ror such as this well ill not stand here quiet to be
slowly impaled when those needles begin to sting me
ill thmst myself upon them and make a quick end of it
ill not give him the satisfaction of witnessing my linger-
ing agonies

  grimly the american took his stand arms folded in
the centre of the cell slowly oh so slowly the needle
points approached long minutes passed

  at last the end was at hand already some of the
fatal points were entering the doomed mans clothing
he closed his eyes and began a last prayer to the god
of his fathers he was resigned suddenly the pressure
relaxed-a breath of moving air fanned him he opened
his eyes miracle of miracles the walls were swiftly
retreating the needles had disappeared in a moment
all was as before

  again he heard stone grating on stone what again
was the release merely a trick to make the torture more
lingering a black oblong showed in the wall hush
a soft voice came to his ears

  dunton relaxed dimly he descried in the black rec-
tangle the form of the beautiful girl who had so haunted
his thoughts

  here quickly take this and to his astonishment he
found in his hand his beloved automatic

  now i feel like a man again but how in the name
of all thats good were you able to make those damnable
walls recede and why have you done this for me
who are you-a thousand questions tumbled from
his lips

  hush softly or we both die the death should he
find us here he will condemn us both to eternity in hell

leilas dream

 t am called leila the soft voice went on in low

  a voiced murmuring i am the foster daughter
of the great lama and i serve him in his noble work
who my own people are i know not sometimes i
dream-but this is not the time for that i have lived
here many years and he has taught me many things-
the motions of the moon and the stars and the greater
knowledge that great shaitan has vouchsafed only to
him he has taught me the languages of all the earth
so that when the great day comes i might aid him the
vicar of shaitan on earth to rule wisely-that the
greatest evil might come to his people

  alway have i prayed to shaitan that the day might
come soon never have i doubted the true faith till-
woe is me-till you came fair skinned as i when i
first beheld you something within me drew towards you
somehow i felt a kinship with you somehow then
doubt crept into my mind doubt of shaitan and of his
teachings i fought against it i had nigh won the fight

till i saw them drag you struggling to this foul dungeon
then i knew john dunton that he was wrong that
evil was not the great principle i knew that god was
the greater all this i knew john dunton because-
a flush made more beautiful that flowerlike cheek-
because-

  because you love me dunton burst forth and i
love you my dearest and in that cell the two were
enfolded in each others arms

  a long minute they remined thus their horrible sur-
roundings forgotten then lingeringly they parted and
leila spoke again

  it was the best of luck my dear one that you were
put in this the cell of a thousand needles many years
ago i found a secret passage in the walls a passage
which was unknown even to him and i traced it to this
cell there is a spring that causes the walls to withdraw
there is another spring which moves aside one of the
great rocks that form the wall

  i waited till the shall hours of the morning then i
stole to where they had placed the clothes in which you
were brought i found your weapon then i made my
way to the entrance of the secret passage just below
the great hall within the station of the outer guard
and came here to you

  my brave my dear leila thanks wily to you am
i still alive but enough of this we have work to do-
my god the opening has shut itself

  aghast the two sprang to the wall where leila had
appeared it was true while they had forgotten the
world in their rapture something had moved the great
stone and barred the exit frantically they pulled and

eushed at the great rock but it was immovable then
luntons usual calmness returned

  think a moment dearest this device must be
planned along the lines of the other secret panels in
the tower how do they work

  you are right there must be some marks which in-
dicate the proper places to press the hidden springs
but it is too dark to see them

  then let us wait for the morning there seems to
be a window way up on that wall see there where
that dark circle breaks the phosphorescent glow per-
haps when the sun rises there will be light enough to
see the marks

  the waiting will not be too long together

  dunton slipped off the jeweled robe which he still
wore and spread it in a comer come dear sit here
with me and tell me of the dreams of which you re-
ferred since first i set eyes on your dear face i have
been haunted by some strange familiarity in your
features perhaps your dreams will give some clue as
to who you are

  leila nestled close against her stalwart lover and
began

  these dreams of mine are not at all vivid they are
confused and shadowy but they come back again and
again i seem to be living in a small white house i
have many toys and i am very happy there are yellow
skinned people about they sweep and clean one a
woman does not sweep and clean but she is always
near me

  there is another woman not yellow but white she
seems very dear to me when i see her in my dreams
my heart aches and an unbearable yearning comes over
me

  there are white men too sometimes many of them
tramp about they are dressed in beautiful red clothes
sometimes they give me shiny buttons to play with at
	wonder stories quarterly

other times there is just one white man in a red coat
he too seems very dear to me i kiss him and he
throws me up in the air and laughs
but the dream i have oftenest is not pleasant time
and again i have waked up screaming f-om its terrors
it is night and i seem to be awakened by a terrible
scream there are muffled thumping as of many men
rushing about softly then my door pens and two
dark men run in one of them hold a doth in his band
which he throws over my head  litre is a sweetish
smell-then i wake up

  by the seven stars ive got it dunton sat up
straight in his excitement i know who you are great
guns what a coincidence i know whom vcremind
me of now major blakely youre -hi daughter
stolen fifteen years ago

   swiftly he told her of the tale lie had liaard in the
shanghai club wide-eyed leila drank in the tale
then im an englishwoman and tbat old man is
planning to ruin my own people johfmust save
them oh if it were only light so that i coula see haw
to get out of here but tell me all about my father
and my country

the fateful hour

tor a long time dunton talked to the girl in his arms
x till he saw her pretty head droop and her blue eyes
veiled in sleep gently he held her until he too dozed
off exhausted by the stirring emotions of that fateful
day

  his adventurous years had habituated dunton to
awakening at any prearranged time and so just as a
faint paling of the black aperture in the wall told of
the near approach of dawn his eyes opened he waited
yet a moment till the blackness of the cell had a little
lightened then awakened his new found sweetheart
with a kiss

  come dear wake up we must work quickly the
old man set sunrise as the hour when he will throw
the switch we must get to him before that

   leila sprang up and the two ran to the wall through
which she had entered it sho-jw be just about here
the girl murmured ye set this depression is too
regular in shape to be accidental here is another there
should be a third so that the three make a triangle-
here it is now to find the right combination

   a moment of tentative pressings-then the great rock
swung aside beyond dunton glimpsed the beginning
of a steep staircase of stone shinywith the moist drip-
pings of ages swiftly leila closed it

  theres some of the old devils magic for him to
ponder over dunton laughed grimly now keep
behind me and direct me by touching my back-left
right and the small of my back for stop dont talk
guided thus the explorer and the long-lost english
girl hastened silently upward the staircase seemed in-
terminable as the pressing need for haste goaded them
at last dunton felt the signal to halt

  they listened not a sound penetrated to them in
a barely perceptible whisper dunton directed open
the door then jump aside when i have gone out close
it again and you stay here till i knock six times on the
wall-three slow three fast

   a rectangle of opalescent light appeared beyond was
the spiral slope that first had brought the american to
the dome just above him a maroon guard was floating
upward

dunton stepped out onto the slope at once he felt
the levitating force grip him he floated on and up

  almost at once the sumpiit of the slope was reached
as the attraction was released momentarily for the
opening of the trap above dunton viciously struck the
guards head with his clubbed automatic then imme-
diately the explorer ripped off the now unconscious
mongols maroon robe and hat and donned them in
mid-air as he rose to pass into the great hemisphere
above

  a scene of great activity burst on dunton as he
reached the floor of his objective a horde of the lamas
minions were rushing about in the ordered confusion
of an enormous enterprise a hum slowly rising in
pitch told of the starting of the huge generator the
screen was gone and the great tubes were beginning
to glow cherry red as the electrical current commenced
to heat their filaments

  dunton merged himself with the busy throng till he
reached the rear of the thought transference screen
then crouched there securely hidden to his delight
he found that the screen was a network of fine wire
and thus from his dark vantage point the explorer coukl
see every corner of the brilliantly lighted room himself
unseen before him shaitans high priest was seated on
his throne listening to reports and dispatching orders
through a constant stream of messengers

  a deep-toned gong reverberated through the space
the old lama arose as a sudden paralysis seized the
scurrying crowd the priest raised his right hand high
and spoke

  all is now prepared in a moment the suns rays
will gild the topmost peaks of the mountains and the
shaitans day will dawn i would be alone in the hour
of his triumph alone with shaitan ye have done well
ye faithful servants of the true master of the world
go ye now each to his quarters and await my call
when next ye behold me ye shall have received your
reward

behind the woman

as the crowded space cleared dunton gasped with
horror leila whom he thought safely hidden in
the secret passage was making her way through the
retreating mob to the lamas throne the priest saw
her what do you here maiden have you not heard
my command

  father the clear voice replied think you that i
could be any other where at this moment despite your
command or that of any other one my place is here
dunton realized that the speech was for his ears in
spite of his distress he glowed with pride at her desire
to be at his side in the hour of danger

  so be it i had not thought of thee but i am in-
deed glad that thou art here for look you those fools
who have labored here and whose usefulness to shaitan
and to me is now at an end will indeed receive their
reward ere they again behold me their quarters are
filled with a most deadly gas and their next meeting
with me will be in shaitans realm silence now while
i invoke him to witness his triumph

  the old man strode to the center of the room raised
his arms to the image of his master on the dome over-
head and intoned a prayer

  o lord of evil great shaitan thy humble servant
brings thee now the great gift which he so long ago
vowed to make thee the whole world and all its
people i lay at thy feet asking no reward content but
that thou shall be glorified i invoke that thou accept
this my offering

did dunton dream it or did an unholy expression of
the tower of evil

 v

evil triumph illumine the face of the fiend painted on
the dome

  and now to throw the master switch the priest
turned toward the great board

  stop dunton had leaped from his hiding place
with his menacing automatic outthrust stop or i
shoot

  the startled priest stared incredulously at the sudden
apparition a moment of realization then with a snarl
of baffled rage he turned with uncanny swiftness he
seized leila and swung her before him as a living shield
then only he spoke-

  so you think to defeat me in the very instant of
realization shoot then but your womans god will
not let you shoot a woman even in his defense with
this he commenced backing slowly toward the switch
which would debase the globe

  dunton was aghat he must choose between killing
his beloved and the ruin of the world whitefaced he
tried to force his reeling brain to make the awful de-
cision but leila was quiescent frantically she beat
and clawed at the old mans face frenziedly she kicked
and struggled that slight form seemed to be invested
with a strength almost equal to the madmans own he
reeled and staggered then with a final surge of desper-
ate force she broke loose from the lamas clutch--he
fell with her fierce thrust but as he fell he reached
for the switch-his hands grasped-not the switch but
two huge terminals a scream of agony-a blinding
flash-a smell of burnt flesh-and an inert body dropped
to the floor

  when the two saviors of the world somewhat recovered
from the terrific strain of that scene and determined
that the arch-enemy was indeed dead dunton seized a
small ebony chair and turned toward the intricate maze
of apparatus leila detained him

  what are you going to do dear

  smash up every bit of the hellish devices so that
never again can anyone use them to menace civilization
i want to destroy every vestige of that product of dis-
torted genius and then forget even the little i know of
its working

  but wait just a minute john think first of those
poor slaves whom we saw last night they are still
under the spell if you destroy the apparatus now they
will remain forever in its power why not bring them
back here first and release them

  you are right dear heart and now that i stop to
think only one of the old devils inventions is essentially
evil it would be a shame to destroy that marvelous
transportation device-that at least is of tremendous
value

  now let me see there are the keys which will bring
back those poor lost souls turn this way-he said
and dunton operated the switches he had pointed out

  now lets get down into the garden good clean
air will be most welcome after that cell and all we have
gone through in this horrible place

  again they entered the gorgeous garden beauty had
been there before but an evil beauty now the bright



  morning sun illumined a flowery fairyland whose fresh
colors bespoke the beauty of natures loveliness

  look there dear-they are coming

  over the snowy caps of the towering peaks that
rimmed the gardens now appeared one after another
what seemed huge birds high in that illimitable blue
they soared then in great swooping spirals they de-
scended from every point of the compass they came
till the garden was again peopled with a throng of men
of every race again they walked the garden with their
lack-lustre eyes

released

when the sky was clear again dunton ascended
again to the great hall he found a sliding panel
through which he could see the garden

  how am i going to release them he pondered he
walked over to the tubes which he knew produced the
nerve-vibration only two were glowing the same two
which had been lit when first he had beheld them

  hm perhaps these control the vibrations ill chance
it picking up the ebony chair he had intended to use
before he sent it crashing through the glass of the two
tubes then he leaped back to his lookout far below
him he could see the crowd of men but no longer were
they moving about aimlessly mechanically most were
still as if in bewilderment but even from that great
height the american could determine that there was no
mechanical stiffness above the gestures of those who
were not still

  hastily he descended to the garden it was true
bewildered wondering where they were and how they
had been brought there the erstwhile robots were
human once again

  little remains to be told after the explanation of
what had occurred to them had finally penetrated the
astounded minds of the freed ones they aided dunton
with a will in obliterating that part of the lamas ap-
paratus which produced and controlled the nerve-vibra-
tions it was unanimously decided that the unbelievable
tale should not be told to the world and it was also
voted that the transportation rays be not used until
their operation had been thoroughly studied by qualified
scientists

  the experience of the explorer stood all in good stead
in organizing and conducting the return to civilization
major blakelys astonished joy at the recovery of his
long-lost daughter need not be described as need not
the simple ceremony which united the american ex-
plorer and the maiden

  one incident is however worthy of mention as the
long cavalcade struggled over the summit of a pass
through the mountains guarding the gardens of the
tower of evil john and leila intoned the immemorial
phrase which every tibetan voices as he reaches the
highest point of his journey from one side of a mountain
range to the other never had that phrase been more
approriate-

there are many persons who are superstitious
and imagine that friday brings bad luck heaven
knows i too have to watch out to keep from be-
coming superstitious myself

   it was eight oclock in the evening thank god not
much more could happen to me that day there had
been quite enough already for my modest needs that
very morning-it was to laugh i was getting as much
mail as a busy office i could see
by looking at my good landlady

frau miillensiefen that this big
mail had considerably raised me
in her esteem dear frau miillen-
siefen if she only knew to be
sure the envelopes of all those
letters had splendid addresses i
got letters only from leading firms
-borsig krupp siemens and the
like but sad to say the contents
of the letters were always the
same  they all said

   my dear sir we are very sor-
ry that we cannot avail ourselves
of your services since for the
present we are not taking on any
additional employees we are re-
turning your letters of recom-
mendation herewith respectfully
yours
all these firms
seemed to have just
a single form for let-
ters of rejection

  that morning i had
had three such in my
mail i had made five
visits all without re-
sult and that eve-
ning i had been to see
my guardian

  my dear boy he
said you are now
twenty-one ill gladly
admit that youve been
diligent youve good
testimonials and
youve passed your
examinations in the
technical school with
distinction but now
-you are of age and
my guardianship is at
an end i still have
your inheritance to
give you it is very
little to be sure since
your education and
your support have
cost money there are
still some three hun-
dred marks left
which i will now hand
over to you you have learned something you are healthy
and vigorous and you must now stand on your own feet
you understand that i myself have a large family-
my guardian had always been a stranger to me when
my mother died i had just finished my preliminary
studies at that time i had felt that my guardian was

    	about ieventy-ve dollirs



right in advising me not to continue at school but to
get out and earn some money in a hurry but i am
inclined now to think he was wrong i had worked for
three years at the junker plant with borsig and at a
large electrical plant then i had put in two years in
the technical school-and here was i without a position

  i went home very much depressed what now three
hundred marks-and as good as shown the door by my
guardian three hundred marks
would support me at most two
months i must at once seek a
position i was very gloomy i de-
termined to take the final step as a
young engineer i evidently had no
prospects but would someone per-
haps hire me as a mechanic or
workman i must put my pride in
my pocket

  as i entered my room frau
miillensiefen called to me
theres another letter for you
i shrugged my shoulders from
whom now i had been keeping a
record and always crossed off the
names when i got an answer
which was of course a refusal

   i turned on the light and stepped
to my desk yes there really was
a letter there from berlin in a
grey business envelope
without a return ad-
dress i opened it
this is what it said
you asked me for
a position i shall ex-
pect you monday
evening at nine oclock
in the hotel adlon

  signed

   frank allis ter

  i read the letter
three times shaking
my head i walked up
and down the room
and then re-read the
letter again frank
allister this was
very strange who
was frank allister
where had i seen that
name the more i
thought of it the
more perplexed i be-
came frank allister
-why that had hap-
pened today it was in
the afternoon in the
cafe bauer i had
stepped in a moment
to look at the papers
that is to say at the
advertisements of po-
sitions open while there my eye had fallen on this
advertisement

  wanted at once a young active ger-
man engineer for work outside of the
country requirements health and
ability only those who know they
are what i want will apply frank al-

 ftom the hundreds of science fiction stories
 that are printed each year there are a few
 that stand out above the others because of
 the great ideas contained in them because of their
 thrilling incidents and the daring and imagina-
 tion of the author

   such an outstanding story is electropolis
 which we take pleasure in presenting for the first
 time in america

  our authors theme is simply stupendous
 imagine a desolate stretch of land as large as a
 european country being transformed into a literal
 garden of eden through the aid of the forces of
 nature harnessed by a scientific genius such as
 the world has seldom seen

   our author has given us here a novel which is
 certain to be remembered for a long time hun-
 dreds of millions of dollars pass hands in gigantic
 deals empires are bought and sold vast domains
 of power are harnessed and all by two men who
 had a few years ago made a bare living by shining
 shoes

   we recommend this story enthusiastically to our
 readers as one of the best of the year

lister hotel adlon

  i remember i had read this advertisement-several
times thinking should i write to him but i con-
cluded that the advertisement clearly indicated a swind-
ler or a lunatic and i had not written but now here
comes an answer to an advertisement that i had not
written about how could it be 

a mysterious interview

i reflected again no indeed i was sure i had
not written nr had i spoken with anyone about
it i was sure of this and now-

  frau miillensiefen f called when she came i
said i cant seem to see very well my eyes are tired
please read me this letter

   from her lips it read just as it had to me

   isnt the signature frank allister

  yes-frank allister but if you want to be there
at nine youll have to be quick about it

   right-o 

  by the way there was someone here this afternoon
  what who was it

  i dont know he looked as if he came from the
police he asked all kinds of questions about you

   im not afraid of the police

  thats just what i thought

  i raced down the stairs and just caught a bus it
was one minute of nine when i reached the adlon of
course i still didnt understand and had absolutely no
hope quite the contrary i was pretty sure some
friend was playing a practical joke on me of course
while i was standing in the hotel door i saw it clearly
neither the envelope nor the letter had a printed head-
ing some one of my acquaintances had read the ad-
vertisement and written the letter probably he was
right now standing somewhere nearby to laugh at me
when i came out again from the hotel should i go
in or not  it would be silly not to see it through now
that i was here and i had the letter

   i went into the office and asked a little timidly may
i see mr allister

  what is your name

  i gave the clerk my card which he read he nodded
you are expected boy take the gentleman to mr
allister room 

  i started involuntarily i had to hold on to the door
for a moment the floor seemed slipping from under
my feet mr allister expected me how was that pos-
sible the one man to whom i had not applied

  we stood before the door of the room the boy
opened it and i stepped in i saw a slender man evi-
dently an american sitting at a desk working just
as i entered a large clock in the room struck nine loud-
ly

  mr allister looked up cast a hasty glance at me at
the large clock and at his watch he nodded and said
have a seat

  i seated myself beside the desk on a chair which he
indicated there was something strange in the voice of
this man something dry monotonous and impersonal
with his eyes still bent on his work he said you
asked me for a position

  i reflected i had not asked him for a position it
was some error should i tell him so  should i actual-
ly try to get myself a position by fraud  i felt that it
was impossible to deceive this extraordinary man per-
haps i was only dreaming all this anyway

  mr allister i should of course be happy if you
could use me but i didnt apply

  for a moment i thought that a smile hovered over the
leathery face of the american

  you applied in person you told me yourself

  i jumped up mr allister you are confusing me
with someone else

  you said it to me with your eyes this afternoon at
four oclock in the cafe bauer i was standing beside
you when you read the advertisement with your eyes
you applied for the position

  i had an uncanny feeling but how did you know
my name 

  well if you leave letters addressed to yourself lying
about-

  mr allister-

  time is money i cant tell you everything now
and it doesnt matter im ready to hire you begin-
ning to-day monthly salary fifty english pounds with
free board and lodging your contract for three years
stay an increase in salary every three months fifty
per cent i am permitted to discharge you at any time
if you dont come up to my expectations but i must then
pay you three months salary and your fare home do
you agree 

i was thunderstruck this was a princely position
a thousand marks a month with increases and with
free board and lodging as well there was certainly
something phony about it i could not help hesitating
well  i cant offer you any more than-

  mr allister i-what sort of a position is this
what will my duties be 

  i cant tell you anything about it now besides i
am only the representative of our common chief

  who is this chief

  mr schmidt

  i stared at him and he looked me earnestly in the eye

is it a hoax

 t understand you dont know what to make
 of it young man i have confidence in you
look here here are the applications which i have re-
ceived this afternoon there were seven hundred and
forty-eight i read them and threw them in the waste-
basket you have pleased me and im ready to hire you
i have confidence in you and you must have it in me
also i cant tell you any more now but you may rely
on there being nothing dishonorable that you are to do
it is work of the greatest and most sublime significance
for the world now i unfortunately have no more time
here is the contract if you sign it i shall give you an
advance of five hundred marks and at midnight to-
night you will enter your position if not-well i
shall not urge you here is the contract i have signed
a copy of it here are the five hundred marks either
tonight at midnight you will be on the flying field of
tempelhof at the machine prepared for frank al-
lister or else you will be back here in the hotel at eleven
and return me the money

  mr allister you dont know me and yet you are
going to give me the money but what if i do not come
either to the hotel or to the flying field 

  then i should travel away with the feeling that a
german had cheated an american it will not be so
now i am busy good-bye

  in a few minutes i stood again in front of the hotel
it was twenty minutes past nine i looked about in-

about -	the berlin airport
elegtropolis



voluntarily for the friends who had played this trick on
me heavens-the next day was april first

  to be sure the gang had fooled me well of
course it had not been the real mr allister the one
with the advertisement in the paper it was some young
american whom my friends had taken into their con-
fidence and of course the clerk at the adlon was
bribed but where did they get the bills naturally
they were counterfeits some sort of stage money-and
just then rudolf sperber came along i laughed at him
well roared lion i called out with affected gaiety
what does that mean

  mr frank allister sends his regards where are
the other fellows

  he looked at me in amazement anyway youre in a
better humor than you were this noon did you have
a drink at your guardians

  no it was a whiff of strong tobacco from you fel-
lows

  really youre a scream

  what do you mean a scream i signed up with mr
frank allister for three years a thousand marks a
month traveling expenses and more besides old man
you know it better than i do but i hope the real frank
allister doesnt get wise to your nerve

  rudolf grasped my arm fritz what on earth is the
matter with you come along were all over in the
patzhofer in friedrichstrasse

  naturally

  we walked fast saying nothing more our friends
were sitting in the back room it was our little club
from technical school days

  here i am you did it well you scamps

  they looked at me with gloomy faces we were all
in about the same boat except that the rest at least had
parents but i noticed that rudolf was whispering to
walter gerhard the president of the club then both
looked searchingly at me i was struck with a sort of
malicious humor i raised the glass of beer which the
waiter brought me and cried long live mr allister
walter stepped over to me what do you mean by
mr allister rudolf lias just been telling me

  i was rather peeved dont bother your premature
april fool joke was very clever

  walter had become serious i dont know of any
april fool joke

  o heavens dont bother about it do you hear
you wrote me a letter and signed it frank allister
then you got me into the hotel adlon but where did
you get the american and the wonderful counterfeit
money

  now they had all become serious and were standing
about me we dont know a thing about it honest
go on tell us quick whats up
it was my turn now to be amazed-their faces were
so honest in their surprise i showed them the letter i
had received told them of the interview in the hotel
and finally laid the five hundred-mark bills on the table

  walter gerhard who was older than the rest of us
read the letter and the contract and said seriously
truly we didnt play any joke we-

  i interrupted him with trembling lips then-
then-you think-it was the real frank allister and
the contract-

  walter had the money in his hand at any rate the
bills are genuine

  i clung fast to the edge of the table yes but then-
but then-

 walter shook his head its strange all right and
 where are you to go

 i have no idea im to find out tonight at the flying
 field

 a most remarkable affair walter reached for
 his hat and coat see here well go again to the hotel
 adlon ill come along as your older friend if this
 frank allister is an honorable man he will understand
 i pressed his hand

 the rest of us will wait until you come back

 it was half-past ten when we were again in the hotel
 meanwhile the clerk with whom i had talked had gone
 off duty and another was there

 may we see mr frank allister

who

 mr frank allister

 hie looked in the register i dont know him he isnt
 registered here

 he turned his attention to other guests and we went
 out again walter anxiously pressed my hand if i
 hadnt seen the contract he said i should think you
 had been dreaming

 i looked at him in horror perhaps i am still dream-
 ing now

 he hit me hard on the shoulder youre crazy we
 are wide awake

 but what are we to do now i still have the five
 hundred marks

 we must anyway be at the flying field before twelve
 then we shall see if nobody there knows about this
 allister then we must take the money to the police to-
 morrow

 and if its true after all

 he looked doubtfully at me its very strange-just
 you and over seven hundred applicants

 i seized his hand its all the same to me here
 in berlin i have nothing my guardian has put me out
 of his house if things are right i shall go along
 wherever it is

 walter looked at me seriously i wont advise you
 but i would do the same thing myself

chapter ii
a startling revelation

 it was eleven oclock and we had no more time to lose
 we could not tell our other friends and we did not
 want to i did not want them all at the flying field
 to see me made a fool of we were still standing before
 the hotel we must take a taxi said i i must in
 any case go home first if i am really leaving

 at this moment an empty taxi came cruising up to us
 twenty-six elsasserstrasse

 i know the chauffeur said in a monotone

 we were sitting in the taxi didnt the driver just
 say i know how can he know where i live
 dont be foolish he means he knows where el-
 sasserstrasse is

 but i perceived that he too did not exactly believe what
 he was saying

 it took only a few moments to reach my rooming-
 house i quickly threw my few things into a suit-case
 and we rushed downstairs again we were on the way
 once more at quarter-past eleven

 if it really comes true youll have to pay my landlady
 tomorrow and tell my guardian

 dont worry about that old top

 promptly at quarter of twelve we were on the flying
 field not at the door but right on the field itself we

 had been admitted at once and as we got out of the taxi
 we saw before us a machine ready to start

  i asked a gentleman standing beside it pardon me
do you know where there is a machine ready for mr
frank allister somewhere here

  certainly this machine

  i felt as though an icy hand were passing down my
spine by the light of the bright lamp i saw that my
friend had turned pale

  a gentleman now came out from behind the machine
i recognized frank allister he raised his finger to his
cap and said well i knew you were coming we still
have ten minutes you start at one minute after mid-
night

  i gathered my courage together where am i go-
ing

  at midnight the first of april comes in at nine
in the morning on april sixth you will enter your posi-
tion you know of course that your salary begins al-
ready at midnight

  and where do i take up my duties

   in desert city

  and where is desert city

  frank allister replied as though it were the most
natural thing in the world in the middle of the aus-
tralian desert

  now my friend walter for whom things were getting
too much took a hand sir i am the older friend of
this young man what are your intentions toward him
what sort of a contract is it what strange things are
these you are talking about

  mr allister looked surprised i think it is a very
favorable contract for so young a gentleman

  you cant persuade me that in six days from now my
friend can take up a job in the middle of the australian
desert

rapid transit

mr allister looked at his watch we still
have six minutes taking a notebook f rom his
pocket he continued from here to australia is about
thirteen thousand kilometers you know that a hun-
dred and twenty kilometers an hour is not much for a
good plane so there is absolutely no reason why this
distance could not be flown in one hundred and seventeen
hours at that rate you would already be there on the
spot at nine oclock in the evening on the fifth of april
but we must take into account the change in the time
since you are flying east between here and australia
there is nine hours difference also you will change
machines five times and that means a loss of half an
hour each time

  you leave here at midnight and on april first at
eight in the evening local time you will be at trebizond
in turkey on the black sea

  that is two thousand kilometers you leave at eight-
thirty at sevtn the next morning local time you are
in teheran persia thats a short jump of only twelve
hundred kilometers

  on april three at two in the morning you are in
hyderabad india a distance of two thousand kilometers
at midnight the same day you reach colombo ceylon
a distance of two thousand seven hundred kilometers
on april fifth at three-thirty in the morning you reach
kroe in sumatra on april sixth at seven in the morn-
ing you cross cambridge gulf in australia and at
eight sharp you land in desert city in the last two

a kilometer is  miles a thousand kilometers is roughly  miles

days you have to be sure to cover three thousand kilo-
meters each day if you land in desert city at eight
you have a full hour to look at your home and theres
absolutely no reason why you cant enter your position
at nine

  walter had put his arm about me we could say
nothing we stared silently at this man who talked of
a thirteen thousand kilometer trip through the air with
such exactness and indifference as if he were telling
us of a flight from berlin to breslau

  time sir

  a face was turned to us from the control seat of the
plane it was a dark brown face the features very
sharp really a somewhat uncanny countenance and there
was also a very foreign and oriental tone in the accent

  mr allister looked at his watch you have one
minute more

  i seemed to be in a dream and i think walter felt
the same way i pulled a hundred-mark bill from my
pocket pay my landlady

  i could say no more i felt myself lifted into the
cabin of the plane at the same moment the engine
started the wheels ran along the ground for a few
seconds and before i could even step to the window
to wave again to my friend the giant bird was already
rising into the air it circled upward and shot through
the night with the ocean of streets of the great city
below me

  my head was dazed i felt no joy i felt that i was
in the power of strange men and that i had committed
a terrible blunder it became dark round about us the
sea of light of berlin grew pale and the night swallowed
us up

  now for the first time it occurred to me that i was
alone in the cabin of the plane i looked about me mr
allister had not come along

  it was nothing new for me to sit in a plane since i
had served a whole year at the junker plant but i had
never seen so wonderful a cabin within all was pan-
elled wood a great armchair with some mechanism to
make it a very comfortable reclining chair invited me
to rest in it

  the electric lighting made it bright and cheerful in
the cabin beside the chair was a folding table and in
the wall were many little cabinets with inscriptions like
this

  cold food-boiling water-coffee machine

-teapot -wine- icecold lemonade-

books and maps-newspapers

  i had become calm i was quite alone in this cabin
and from what mr allister had said no landing was
planned for two thousand kilometers it now occurred
t me that during the entire day what with my various
unpleasant surprises i had eaten almost nothing since
the cabin was apparently arranged solely for my dis-
posal the provisions in the cabinets if there were any
must also be for me

  i opened a cabinet marked cold food well mr
allister or his chief the mysterious mr schmidt in
the australian desert seemed to have no bad cuisine
there was a most appetizing cold roast goose my eye
fell on sausages delicious looking ham and bread and
butter and from the cabinet came a cold breeze it was
a frigidaire

  why should i hold back why should the goose go
begging
electropolis	

new scenes

i began to enjoy the adventure what could hap-
pen to me i had seven hundred marks in my pocket
my advance pay and the remainder of my inheritance if
worst came to worst i could get along for a while i
reflected that i had expected to pass a very depressed
evening in my room-and now look at me

  roast goose was no common thing in my life it was
strange how much of it disappeared down my throat
not to mention the other good things-the sausage the
ham and the cheese the wine too was not bad when
i had carefully stowed the remainder of the food in
the frigidaire put the used dishes into a cabinet desig-
nated as the washing machine and lighted a good cigar
taken from the humidor i put the bottle of wine beside
the armchair and got out of the book cabinet the maps
and travel books of asia my condition i found not
only romantic but also very comfortable

  still i could not help wondering was i actually
despite my youth such a genius how was it that just
i was selected from over seven hundred applicants
well mr schmidt probably had confidence in mr
allisters judgment of human nature and if mr allister
thought me a genius why should i contradict him

  at any rate one miracle was explained mr allister
had intimated that he had sent the taxi to the hotel for
me he did know human nature he knew that i would
return to the hotel probably he had instructed the clerk
to deny any knowledge of him

  why i perceived that i was thinking more slowly
the day with its excitement the strong wine the rich
wood-how comfortable the chair felt the plane flew
splendidly the motor worked to perfection the gentle
vibration of the cabin was pleasant i had often flown
but always out in the control seat how soft the chair
was-how comfortable the floor felt under foot i
yawned finished the bottle threw the butt of my cigar
into the ash tray and leaned back automatically the
chair changed into a couch and my eyes closed

  frau miillensiefen - frau miillensiefen

  i awoke in my half-awake condition it seemed to
me as though someone had knocked on the door and
roused me i sat up and looked about drowsily i had
no idea where i was until recollection at last came back
to me the cabin-the plane heavens i was not in
my room good frau miillensiefen was part of the
past-i was in the plane heaven knew where

  i stepped to the window before preparing to sleep
i had pulled down the shades i pressed a button and
they flew up while the light went out at the same time
i looked at the clock it was eight in the morning

  i gazed out the window we must have been flying
high beneath me was a mighty mountain landscape
there were splendid forests far off out of which very
jagged conical rocks jutted up there were mountains
with eternal snows their peaks partly veiled by mist

  i forgot all my anxiety where was i  on the wall
was a large map of the route from berlin to trebizond
on this map was a black star when i looked closely
i saw that this star was moving along very slowly the
star then represented the plane in which i sat by some
automatic device the star slipped over the map and
indicated at each moment the position in the map over
which we were flying

  i had slept through czecho-slovakia poland and
hungary beneath me under my eyes intoxicated by
the bizarre beauty of these mountains lay the peaks of
the carpathians

  poetry and prose i turned from the view and went
into the little wash room i washed in pleasantly cool
water and then took from a cabinet a thermos bottle
of excellent coffee and helped myself to a tin of milk
bread butter and good ham

  what a life and at the same time we were gliding
over the mountains and these were gradually opening
up into wooded slopes

   a few hours later we were flying lower at my feet
lay a splendid large city with bright domes and towers
and broad streets in which people swarmed like ants
this city lay beside a stormy sea over which great ships
were sailing on the map i saw odessa

  it was odessa on the black sea i was flying over
odessa instead of sitting in my little room writing
applications which would be refused i thought of
berlin what would my landlady say probably walter
was even now at my guardians

   i sat by the window the plane was violently rocked
now the black sea was below us the waves dashed
high and i felt as though i were in a motion picture
hour after hour passed slowly it became night i
saw a strip of shore

  a whistle sounded in my cabin i had finished my
goose land was before us and the plane was descend-
ing lower i saw a coastline divided into many bays
before me was a city an oriental city with slim tower-
ing minarets behind the ground rose in terraces great
caravans of camels were approaching now an electric
sign flashed in the cabin change in trebizond in five
minutes this sign was of course in english

beyond civilization

in great excitement i got my suitcase ready trebi-
zond  almost the very end of turkey recollections
awoke in me-strange yearnings tales of fantastic
travels

   the landing wheels crunched over soft sand the motor
was shut off and i heard wild screams about me the
plane stood still and the cabin door was opened a dark-
skinned fellow stood before me he was wrapped in
a long white mantle with a silk turban on his head his
bare black legs showed under the white mantle and he
had rings on his toes good evening mister he said

  he took the suit-case and i got out i stood in a
great square about me were hundreds of screaming
gesticulating people all were in gay oriental garments
all were busy but nobody was doing anything

  please mister the dark fellow took my hand i
saw that his nails were colored with henna before me
stood another plane exactly like the first quick
mister you were a half-hour late

  i was pushed in the door was shut the sound of
the shrieking people became softer and the wheels slid
over the sand the plane rose into the air it was the
holy month of ramadan and wreaths of gaily colored
lights encircled the slender columns of the minarets
the gay picture beneath me vanished like a tale from
the arabian nights below me now lay a desert and
in the mists of evening i saw another caravan slowly
going out into the waste

   i slept again while my plane glided over the hills
of kurdistan it is morning i have again drunk coffee
but this time the bread had a different taste and instead
of ham i had a chicken roasted in oil i no longer think
about the fact that i have not once seen the pilot of my
plane the machine itself is just like the first

it is seven in the morning it must be very hot out-

out of the earth rose a little car that seemed a cross between an electric car and an elevator

illustration by paul

side below me little houses are bobbing up i see
mohammedan mosques splender minarets and brilliant
palaces again the sign lights up teheran the capital
of persia again there is a crowd of people but this
time they are solemn persians with serious faces again
the quick change i could have wept teheran the
city of the peacock throne and no time to enjoy it

  again the desert an eternal lonely waste with the
pitiless sun blazing down the trip is growing tiresome
the suns heat penetrates the walls of the cabin the
motor operates evenly this plane is like the last only
this time dinner consists of pungent curried mutton and
rice ready for me in a thermos jar this time i am
enticed by strange fruit and i reach not for wine but
for the chilled lemonade

  the desert vanishes and beneath me are again wild
mountains with fearful abysses and peaks horsemen
on bold steeds clad in fantastic garments ride the
passes it is afghanistan the land of mystery i cannot
make out any details since we are high in the air

  it becomes late evening the second evening i pass
in my journey over the earth there is a great river
below me cities with noble palaces white shining marble
temples by shimmering waters surrounded by palm

groves i forget to eat the ship descends lower and
at my feet is india

  at midnight comes the change this time i see gentle
hindoos with slim brownish bodies and kindly dark
eyes again the haste again the yearning in my breast
to see and explore these strange lands-but already
the wheels are turning already we are soaring up above
the shimmering fairy dream of hyderabad

  it was early morning when we passed over the sea
of houses of bombay it was a day of splendid marvels
but pitilessly the plane sped on it was becoming evening
again when we reached the coast then we glided out
to sea over majestic waves rolling at our feet

  midnight i start from sleep the sea is still below
me there are no ships only the full moon and the stars
up above what if the motor should fail now

  two oclock in the morning and a coast appears be-
fore us we fly along it dense primeval forests pre-
cipitous jagged rocky coasts are close below us at
times a settlement appears a farmhouse a village of
naked natives i can tell from the map that the splendid
island at my feet is ceylon and the city before my eyes
colombo the paradise of this earth

  another day a whole day flying over the sea then
z last landing it is a village where a few unclad natives
are about us kroe in sumatra

  the last day and the last night are here on april
first i left berlin at the start of the day this evening
is the fifth and tomorrow- 

  morning comes at last very early morning seven
oclock it is exactly as mr allister said below us a
wild coast a bay without a city it is cambridge gulf
and the land is australia it is a sorry land a sorry
desert here and there overgrown with dense wild
shrubbery

  the plane sinks to earth a man opens the door and
i climb out i totter around being land sick for
my body is accustomed to the motion of the plane as
i look about a hot breeze from the desert blows upon
me in spite of the coolness of the morning

  there stand a few huts of the natives likewise a few
equally wretched shacks made of corrugated sheet iron
the man smiles at me please desert city he said
my heart sank was this desert city

  again the man went on in english eight oclock
mr schmidt expects you in his office at nine

  half dead and in very low spirits i followed the man
who led me to one of the wretched sheet iron huts

chapter iii
a strange journey

my gloom was now complete the sheet iron
shack into which  was taken was an absolutely
bare room containing nothing but bathing fa-
cilities and in a little anteroom a simple bed table
and chair when we entered an old woman was en-
gaged in getting the bath ready while other women were
bringing water for it in buckets which they carried on
their heads otherwise there was very little life in
desert city a few naked children were playing before
the huts of the natives it was in toto a decidedly
wretched sight

  the man who conducted me stood still you will
want to bathe mister there is time the chief expects
you in three quarters of an hour

  i had to question this man though i did not want to
probably it was the effect of the long trip the tense
waiting and now this desolate scene does mr
schmidt live near here

  the chief lives five kilometers away it is hardly
two minutes by electric railway

  i couldnt see anything of an electric railway has
mr schmidt been here long i asked

  the chief bought this territory from the australian
government a year ago

  bought i could not understand why anyone should
buy this dreary desert

  but the man replied with perfect naturalness about
half a million square kilometers

  half a million square kilometers and is all the
land like this here

  the man apparently a half-breed but certainly an
educated person smiled oh no unfortunately there
is also considerable bad land in it

  i stared at him much bad land in it did this man
then call the barren desert in which we were standing
good land

  the australian stepped back the chief doesnt like
it he said if there is much talking but i felt that
i ought to tell you a little by way of explanation you
still have half an hour would you like some breakfast

   about  square miles equal in area to the states of kansas and
colorado

  no i thank you i ate in the plane

  then i should advise you to bathe and change your
clothes there are some ready for you there we all wear
a kind of uniform besides your suit wouldnt do for
this climate at nine sharp or rather at three minutes
of nine the electric car will come and fetch you please
be ready for the car waits only half a minute good
morning sir

  i stood alone lost in thought i looked out once more
and saw nothing but this terrible desert in some places
absolutely bare-in others overgrown with low dusty
greyish shrubbery i walked once around the house
the electric car was to fetch me at nine but there were
no car tracks to be seen here

  i went into the bathroom feeling decidedly depressed
i was very hot and i felt that the sheet iron house
was fairly cool-a fact i had not noticed before the
bath was fine and it was a pity that i could not remain
in it longer-but the mysterious car was due in seven
minutes

  on the chair by the bath lay a suit and fresh linen
it was queer that the uniform included the linen too
there was fine light underwear a new linen shirt and
a tropical suit with a great panama hat all unmarked
it was not really a uniform but from the heat pre-
vailing outside even in the early morning i realized that
my european clothes would have been torture to wear
and i had had no time at all to get anything anywhere
once in the light clothes after my bath i felt much
better i put my suit and my linen in my suit-case and
stepped outside it was just about two minutes of nine
nobody was near and there was no sign of a vehicle
then a long drawn-out shrill whistle sounded right be-
fore me a great trap-door which i thought to be a plank
floor opened out on both sides and out of the earth
rose a little car that seemed a cross between an elevator
and an electric car at once a door opened automatically
and at the same time though nobody was to be seen
a loud voice called out in english get in quickly
please

  i obeyed the call and got into the car looking vainly
for any other occupant after exactly half a minute
the door shut the car lit up and then seemed first to
sink down and afterwards to roll sideways i had my
watch in my hand at nine sharp the car stopped the
door opened and the same voice from an invisible source
called out get out quickly please

  i stood doubtfully in an underground place it was
a large but not very high room like a vestibule or lobby
with various doors around in a circle it was bright
but i could not see the source of the light there was
absolute stillness with nobody but myself in this case

  i had barely had time to make these observation when
the strange voice sounded again the chief wants to
see you

the chief revealed

at the same time a light flashed brightly over one
of the doors leaving me no doubt that i was to
enter there all this seemed highly peculiar i went
up to the door and was about to knock when the door
opened of itself allowed me to enter and silently closed
again behind me

  i stood in another great room this also had no
windows but was perfectly bright without any visible
lighting yonder was a great desk before which a man
was sitting with his back to me there were great
cabinets all around the walls of the room there was


wonder stories quarterly

no carpet on the floor yet it was soft and elastic some
chairs stood around the walls in front of the cabinets
on the surface of the desk were many buttons like
those of electric lights and in the wall opposite the
desk a great sheet of frosted glas was inserted

  hardly had i advanced a step when the same voice
said loudly a visitor

  the gentleman at the desk looked up but not at me
he was looking at the frosted glass in the wall now
i plainly saw my image in the glass which was there-
fore a mirror but it was remarkable to have a mirror
of ground glass the man stood up and turned around
good morning my dear young man said he

  i looked into the mans thin quite energetic face
he had a sharply-cut head with bushy grey hair growing
straight up like a brush he had bushy eyebrows very
vivid eyes a face lined with many wrinkles his age was
hard to guess but his figure was young vigorous and
elastic

  i was prepared for almost anything but not for this
salutation good morning my dear young man it
was certainly a strange mode of address from a chief
to a strange young man

  mr schmidt looked at me there was a slight smile
about his eyes and mouth he said well take a seat
the familiarity which he used as a matter of course
i did not like but i looked around for one of the chairs
mr schmidt pressed a button and the chair rolled out
automatically and stopped beside the desk i sat down
it was a comfortable chair and as i sat there the back
automatically moved forward a bit so that it lay right
against my back mr schmidt looked at me quietly
and gave me time to look at him i must admit that
although i was somewhat ill at ease i yet felt attracted
to this face i felt as though i had seen it before some-
where but of course that was not possible indeed
everything was impossible the way i was hired my
trip my arrival and this man here

  again i had the feeling that all this was only a dream
and i simply did not know whether i should desire to
wake up or to dream on suddenly mr schmidt said
no fritz you are not dreaming

  i started with amazement it was not merely that he
knew my first name but how could he guess that i
thought i was dreaming

  he went on then you really dont recognize me
it is certainly too bad when a young man doesnt know
the only brother of his deceased father

  i stared at him and jumped up quite right i now
knew where i had seen this facel when i was still a
child this man had once spent an hour in our home and
had then departed again

  as i jumped up there was a slight noise below me
and ray chair was rolling back again to its place by the
cabinet the man who called himself my uncle again
pressed the button and the chair returned again

  he said with a smile in my office a person may not
arise until the conversation is over my electric servants
are very diligent and dependable but as yet they dont
know the art of mind reading-

  he smiled rather significantly and continued -al-
though they are very important and indispensable serv-
ants just the same

  i sat down again and he went on certainly my
boy i am your uncle heinrich your fathers only bro-
ther even if no one ever claimed to know anything about
me i was a bad boy in my youth i did not do well
and i cant blame them for sending me to america but
america is a good school a kind of survival of the

fittest those who amount to nothing fall under the
wheels and whoever gets along becomes somebody i
became somebody i had hard schooling and i am now
someone but i was too proud to go back there again
i am also different you father was a splendid man
and a man who went the right course

  your father is dead and your mother also you
must not think because i never sent word of myself
that i did not know about you i was often sick at
heart at being so lonely

  now you are alone i thought if he is a good fel-
low why should i leave my money to strangers  that
is why i sent for you

the three servants

i was going to reply but he again stopped me i
know already what you are going to say why
didnt i write a letter like other people why didnt i say
i was your unde

  that is very simple had i done so you would of
course have run straight to your guardian and the same
man who has now put you out would-well we wont
say any more about that i have to be grateful to him
because if he had not been so harsh a seventh of aus-
tralia would not belong to me to-day

  i was going to interject a desert but he stopped
me with a gesture more of that anon he said let
me finish you neednt imagine that i think you a
genius you really have little to do with the advertise-
ment i hope that mr allister will stir up plenty of
geniuses for i can use some more good workers be-
sides that however he was charged with the errand of
learning about you questioning your teachers making
inquiries at the factories where you worked and then-

  he laughed and his face now looked very pleasant
i just wanted to see whether you had courage and en-
terprise anybody can travel to his uncle but to fly
out into the unknown right across the world to meet an
uncertain future relying on ones own self and ones own
powers-well not everyone can do that

  in that at least you seem to be blood of my blood
and i hope you are that in other things as well as to
the planes mr allister went to germany in them and
whether you were in them or they came back empty
didnt matter

  uncle i was just about to jump up wlien i heard
the noise under the chair i threw myself back but it
was too late the chair and i sped across the room back
into a corner

  my uncle laughed again and pressed the button back
i came

  yes yes my boy everything must be learned and
now to business you have received a contract if you
prove useful it will be kept i have heard only good of
you you can become my right hand

 but-

  no my boy my name is not schmidt how could i
be named schmidt when i am your fathers brother i
just took the name when i wanted to disappear schmidt
is really not a name but a generic idea i knew a fel-
low once who called himself nobody he proved to the
world that this nobody could be a right diligent some-
body i think i shall prove to the world that this
schmidt is a smith who is welding together something
remarkable

at the same time he had stood up and his face again
electropolis	

had a strangely fanatical and energetic expression in-
voluntarily i jumped up again too and the chair whiz-
zed away but my uncle said thats all right let the
chair be its connected with what im going to explain
to you i dont need it with you any more youll find
much here that is remarkable but be assured that im
no magician there are no supernatural things on earth
yet i have learned to make many things useful to me
and perhaps in technical matters i am a few decades
ahead of the world did you ever hear of professor
wenzel aporius

  no i never did

  he was my teacher

  he stepped before me and put his hands on my
shoulders again he had his good-natured smile now
you dont know my boy whether i am a magician or a
lunatic now you are racking your brain as to what i
intend here you have heard that i have bought a half
million square kilometers of desert that is correct
and you dont understand it

   certainly i dont uncle

  im going to tell you that we two-we two do you
hear if we find no other co-workers-will in ten years
or less make of this desert the most fruitful land on
earth

   the fanatical gleam was again in his eyes and i said
can human hands do that  

  no my boy human beings cannot very certainly
but my three servants can

   again i looked at him was the man after all insane 
your three servants i asked

  do you know the names of my three servants the
first is called technology the second electricity and the
third is a very fantastic fellow by the name of radium
with these three plus the power of such a sun as stands
in these heavens and the riches concealed in this decayed
and dried up desert soil you will see what wonders we
shall accomplish

  the first servant you have already met or rather
the first two you saw how punctually my automatic
railroad works and you heard how well the phonograph
replaces a servant to announce visitors perhaps you
dont even yet know that you travelled the last three
thousand kilometers from kroe hither with no pilot
in the plane because i directed the machine from here
by means of the rindell-matthews rays

  i couldnt do this the entire way from germany my
power plant doesnt work so far as that though i be-
lieve that i now possess about the greatest plant in the
world

  and uncle-this cave

  i didnt make it fortunately nature put it at my
disposal for at present its too hot up above and at best
only an australian black can live in a sheet iron hut

chapter iv
an important visitor

he took me by the arm and we went up to the door
when we were about two steps from it the door
opened of itself i had observed that it had no

latch

  its very simple when one comes two paces from
the door ones foot makes a contact if someone comes
from without the phonograph announces him and i can
see his image in that frosted glass which pressing a
button changes into a mirror

   and if a stranger comes

   lad i am still at the beginning of course there are

guards up above even if i do make provision to be
seldom disturbed by them a time will come when we
can dispense with them entirely there is absolutely no
need of them

  you know that its possible by means of selenium
cells to change the spoken word into writing that is
to build a machine into which you speak and which con-
verts your speech into a sort of typewriting

  why not then the reverse  why not an arm which
reaches out to the stranger a phonograph voice which
requests his visiting card then the hand disappears
puts the card into the apparatus with the selenium cells
changes writing to speech and while the car is coming
along underground the phonograph is already announc-
ing the name

  is that possible

  everything is possible the greatest problem is an
economic one and for the present the australian lads are
cheaper than the machines

  we were just about to cross the threshold when a
loud whistle sounded the same that i had heard when
the car fetched me into the world below my uncle-
i was convinced that he was actually that especially as
despite his difference he reminded me very much of
my father-looked at the clock

  the devil a person thinks hes a regular machine
and then a lad like you disturbs his regular course
there is still more german sentiment in me than i
thought on your account i forgot lord albernoons
visit

  i will-

  you may just remain you are to become my co-
worker it will do no harm sit down over there

  at a pressure which moved some lever a folding table
came out of one of the cabinets in the wall this table
had served as the door of the cabinet it took its place
by the wall in the top a board arose uncovering a type-
writer and this board now stood up like a desk the
interior was well filled with letter paper and envelopes

  these are all playthings trifles that i thought out
when i was still working in the great shop of professor
aporius but i made my money with them well talk
more of that later do you write shorthand

  yes uncle

  then it will be as well for you to take down the
conversation my apparatus for recording speech is
not yet quite ready

  lord albernoon wishes to see you this time it
was a human voice an australian servant dressed in
a kind of tropical uniform certainly mr schmidt
knew that the english lord was accustomed to certain
things and so the servant rolled out the chair brought
cigars and cigarettes and placed whiskey soda and ice
on the table after which he vanished

  welcome your lordship you come from canberra
was the trip comfortable

  your airplane was excellent mr schmidt

  did you bring the agreement

  the government has ratified it though the vote was
divided

  he gave my unde a document and the latter read it
aloud in several places nodding his head

  for the present half a million square kilometers the
survey being made in common price per square kilo-
meter one hundred pounds a total of fifty million
pounds sterling payable in fifty installments of a mil-
lion pounds each within fifty years a million pounds an-
nually on april first

  my uncle read these immense sums-fifty million


wonder stories quarterly

pounds sterling meant a thousand million marks-in an
indifferent voice as if the amounts were trifling

  if the purchaser should desire to pay more quickly
the amount is to be adjusted according to the interest
thus saved if the purchaser defaults in one payment
the land and all improvements and additions are to re-
vert without compensation to the government of aus-
tralia

  my uncle looked at his lordship the terms are hard
are they not 

  the australian government will be justified-

  is the agreement signed

  it goes into effect the moment i receive the first pay-
ment of a million

a great transaction

my uncle took a check-book from his pocket if i
still had any doubts of him-if he had still seemed
a bit fantastic-my respect for him now grew enormous-
ly when i saw him verjj calmly write out the check
and watch the signing of the agreement and when lord
albernoon took the check and read a million-the
australian national bank of canberra-all right the
agreement is in force

  his lordship must then have known that my uncle
was good for this sum the latter arose and held out his
hand to albernoon there was something like joyous
excitement in his voice now

  then i am lord of this land it is my property my
lord-to do with as i wish i can act with it as i de-
sire-

  provided it is not to the injury of the australian
continent

  my lord let us shake hands i believe that in less
than ten years i shall have paid off the rest of the sum
i saw that the peer seemed incredulous that he hfd a
smile that he evidently thought my uncle mad but he
said in a businesslike tone you yourself proposed this
agreement i feel it my duty to remind you that you
were in no way coerced and that the australian govern-
ment made you no promises-

  that i was buying anything but a desert quite cor-
rect and now sir i am sorry that i am not able to
offer you a comfortable hotel-

  if you will permit it i will fly right back to can-
berra

  quite as your lordship desires

  the lord carefully folded the check i hope that you
will not regret-

  my uncle smiled again i hope that you and your
government will not either

  he accompanied the peer who had taken no notice
of me to the car i saw that it was not empty but that
two australian soldiers in uniform were waiting in it
the servant opened the door his lordship got in there
was a whistle and again the car went rolling along the
oblique track

  my uncle looked after it gave a short laugh and rub-
bed his hands he was evidently extremely pleased
then he turned to me

  do you know what i am now

  i did not reply

  i might now call myself the emperor of australia
in ten years the britishers will be cursing this govern-
ment he laughed again it is nevertheless a pity
that his lordship was not wearing my uniform like you
a fine comedy could have been made out of this con-

   about 

versation and you would have laughed heartily

  again i did not understand but i did not want to ask
my uncle stepped over to me and looked me in the eye
do you believe in me he asked

  it was a hard question and i saw doubt in his face
without waiting for my answer he arose come
said he

  we now went over the threshold my uncle stopped
and again pressed a button a person should not exert
himself any more than is necessary

to the power plant

he put his arm on my shoulder and we glided for-
ward in the passageway which now branched
off from the oblique line of tracks a moving floor was
let in an endless belt which carried us along with it like
the belts i had seen in warehouses at home

  all this again had an unreal air the passage was
dark but as we glided forward it became bright about
us be careful said my uncle here we are going to
leave the belt

  we stepped off at the same moment a door opened
and we were surrounded by a deafening noise we were
standing in a very high grotto evidently a very ex-
tensive system of caves was in use here we were look-
ing into an electric power station of immense extent
gigantic fly-wheels were humming mighty turbines were
revolving their driving-wheels and one wall was covered
with marble slabs in which a system of levers was set
during my practical education with the personnel of the
siemens plant i had spent six months at the great rum-
melsburg power plant near berlin here i saw it dupli-
cated only on a still larger scale but one thing was
odd we saw only one single man apparently an ameri-
can controlling the whole mechanism he was sitting
in a chair looking sharply about he did not have
dirty hands instead there was before him only a level
switchboard with many buttons and levers

  is all well mr holborn

  all right

  we returned to the moving belt this time my uncle
had to fix a system of dials before a door opened we
entered a small room the walls of which were covered
with a substance unknown to me a great safe stood
here and this too had to be opened in a complicated
fashion before i saw a number of little boxes

  do you know what is in these boxes my army
if only i had been able to overcome the impression
that all this was a dream-or else-no if my uncle was
mad the lord-

  he locked the safe and said calmly each of these
boxes contains a quarter of a kilogram of radium i
have two hundred such boxes

a gigantic plan

again we were sitting in my uncles room we
sat silent for some time there was a strange
contradiction in this man flares of energy almost
fanatical activity an iron will when he was facing the
lord-and then again moments of lassitude moments
in which weariness came over his face when i almost

fitied him i wanted to jump up and embrace him as
used to embrace my father when he was ill

we sat opposite each other in silence my uncles
head was bowed and he was looking straight before him
i looked at him and felt as though we were talking to-
gether as though this strange man whom people at home
electropolis



illustration by paul

a shrill bell sounded and the whole kitchen seemed to come to life

that is how the entire meal is prepared

had spoken of only as an adventurer were related to me
as though i were beginning to be fond of him

  this silent conversation if i may call it so might
have lasted an hour then he raised his head and said
as though merely continuing a long talk then you wish
to work with me

  i felt that i trusted him that i had lost all doubts in
some strange manner if you can use me i replied

  he did not look at me but held out his hand

  i am no longer young to-day i am older than your
father lived to be i am sixty i have lived through
six decades alone very often i should not have cared
if it had been less but now i have a responsibility i
have a work which is my child i need help if you
are to be my co-worker if perhaps someday you are to
be my successor i must explain i have spoken more
to-day than i have in weeks it had to be you must
become acquainted first with the work that i want to
do then with my life

  i know you thought i was mad everyone does but
i am not you see a desert here useless land a step-
child of mother earth what is a desert  why is this
land desert because it lacks life and life for the
desert is water why does many a man remain in-

wardly a desert because water for him to swim in
is lacking because-but i was going to tell of my work

  the earth is great and yet small millions are
crowded together where nature makes life easy for them
and yet they painfully struggle together for bread in-
stead of conquering what is to be conquered

  bring water into the desert traverse it with canals
the earth becomes fruitful release the precious
chemicals here in the decomposed rock which has been
lying fallow for tens of thousands of years they will
become precious loam use the fruitfulness of the
tropical sun-and here where there is nothing but a
barren waste blooming gardens and fields will arise

  you cannot do it human hands cannot you are
right the intense heat of the tropics weakens muscles
that are not of iron that was die great teaching of
my master aporius

  but take machines where men fail you saw that
power plant down there i built it six months ago
a single man can control it and it gives me the power
to draw over the sea to men even the plane in which
you came

what feeds the power plant a subterranean river
and so this land was not always a desert do you
	wonder stories quarterly

know that it has now been discovered that even under
the great sahara there is a subterranean water supply
an entire system of rivers and lakes do you know
that wells have been bored in which animals were found
little water creatures originating far away and brought
there by these subterranean streams

  there is such a river here too perhaps you know
that in the east of the desert that i bought there are
mountains they are high mountains with vigorous
trees it is from these mountains that the river comes
it filled almost the whole of these caves when i found
it now it is under control it runs into my turbines
and feeds them and has to surrender its violent power
to provide me with the electric current which is the heart
of my work

  now for the plan even if i succeeded in turning
this desert into fruitful soil where would the people
come from to cultivate it we are in the tropics where
the white man cannot work

  my unde stopped and rose come with me 

  we entered another room nearby as soon as we
entered the light shone here too in the centre of this
room stood a drcular table with a sheet of glass upon it
under this glass was what appeared to be a remarkable
toy about ten centimeters below the glass sheet there
was another sheet but this one was not of glass it
was ydlow like sand and was traversed by a network
of miniature rails all these rails united in the centre
at one point and on them were tiny plows and planting
machines there were remarkable machines with long
knives stretching out from them and others with great
boxes it seemed as though someone had here imitated
all the agricultural apparatus in miniature for a child

  my unde pressed a switch the picture came to life
the tiny plows glided over the rails they seemed to
loosen the earth the blades were cutting up the ground
the planting machines automatically followed the plows
casting ihe seed behind them came the dark boxes
spraying water in all directions then all the apparatus
came back to the centre my unde pressed another
lever the rails now moved a little to one side and the
same process was repeated in a new place

a mountain of radium

mphis is the legacy of the inventor wenzel
x aporius that is what i intend to carry out
why cannot we perform on a great open expanse what
takes place here on a small scale imagine a network
of such rails with the machines on it and think further
you have seen clockwork and you understand electridty
imagine a dockwork set not for hours but for months
and days for instance the first of february comes a
contact is automatically made and the plows are set in
motion to break up the ground on the next day the
planters follow on the third the sprinklers 

  one single power plant located in the center of the
network like a spider in its web automatically sends
out all these machines the man is only the overseer
who watches over all these iron workers not the worker
himsdf

  imagine such spider webs spread over all the land
which i have bought imagine canals changing the
desert into fruitful land picture the ground tunneled
by mines which unearth treasures and imagine industrial
cities in which machines work for men from this
desert will go forth prosperity the air will be full of
mighty airships carrying in cooled rooms to all the world
the precious fruits and vegetables we shall produce

these airships will be directed by ourselves imagine
that later on in the same way all those parts of the earth
will be made fruitful which are now lying useless as
deserts or covered by the impenetrable primeval forest
want will disappear and with it the struggle for ex-
istence this earth will enter a new era war will
vanish from the earth for what are wars but the struggle
of nations for food it will be an age of joy and
peace-

  in rapt silence he gazed on the vista that opened up
before his eyes i looked at the little dockwork and
saw how the year passed before me just like the course
of the stars in a planetarium i saw ever-changing
machines little harvesters loaded with fruits and com

  the immensity of the idea made me dizzy and
you are going to execute this

  i shall make the start i know that it can be done 
who will complete it  only he who has the same faith
the same vision

  it will cost millions

  he shook his head billions my son

 and-

  perhaps i have them

  you

  perhaps they are buried in the depths of mt rus-
sell

reminiscences

mfcourse you dont know this mountain he went
v on it is in the australian desert it was
there i found the radium

  the radium

  in this world all is chance do you know how
diamonds were discovered in south africa a poor
struggling farmer went out on a trek with his ox-cart
to find some fertile land the rainy season surprised
him and he built a poor hut

  the ground became soft mud his animals died and
he himself was starving when one day his eye fell on
some strangely glittering little pebbles which had seem-
ingly got stuck in the mud they were scattered all
through the muddy crust on his wagon which had dried
in the sun and they were in the mud walls of his hut
again my unde was lost in thought and stood silent
for a while those were the first diamonds observed
before anyone was yet tunnelling in the earth for them
and the farmer became a rich man

  i was young at the time as you are now i was full
of wild dreams i had a tremendous urge in me but
i had no place to live my life i had no definite aim
and i kicked over the traces

  one gloomy day i came to the great aporius he
is dead he died mad the victim of his genius i shall
tdl you of that later

  greedily i drank in his ideas then i lost sight of
him i have been all over the world i went to alaska
in the gold rush i worked in the diamond mines in
kimberley then i was an engineer and earned my
living by hard grueling labor with small returns

ten years ago i came to australia life in the bush
you will learn it a life of wretchedness nevertheless-
i was a hunter of birds of paradise for weeks i
wandered about in the wild mountains i lived with the
wild natives so i came to mt russell

  a signal sounded the note of a bell and my unde
nodded

  once more machines are cleverer than we still it
took a human mind to start these machines and to con-
electropolis



trol them it is noon and probably you have not eaten
since you have been here come we wont keep the
good machine waiting

  he arose now i knew why i felt weak my uncle
looked at me

  you have passed your examination you are of my
blood i have not erred or rather frank allister has
been right again

  an examination but i didnt say anything 
youll understand that when you know the secret of
the chair i dont want to confuse you too much now
again a bell sounded now the ground glass plate
over the desk lit up and an english sentence appeared
returning with twelve german engineers send planes
allister

  my uncle mr schmidt manipulated a telegraphic
key he seemed very well pleased now things are
going to happen allister knows whom he is selecting
i had to have germans but now lets have dinner

  we entered a neighboring room a smaller grotto in
which was a table already set he poured wine into the
glasses wonderfully cooled rhine wine and smiled

  you know i am the big spider i have you in my
web but youll never regret it and now forget the
work for a while the great physician hufeland says
that eating does the most good when people are enjoy-
ing themselves

  heres to germany to our dear native land
youll see that i am not such a bad german as many
think

  he drank the toast then we had a good nourishing
meal i no longer wondered that no living servant
waited on us but that pushing a lever automatically
brought the food on little tables from an opening in the
wall or took it away again

  then my uncle led me to a larger room which was
comfortably fitted out the walls were covered with
hangings there was a couch and a table with books on
it

  i shall send for you when i need you just think
things over now

  he went out of the room and i was alone

chapter v

was it a dream

his is berlin broadcasting on a three hun-
dred and thirty-meter wavelength professor
windmuller will now lecture on australia
the land of the future ah right professor 

  ladies and gentlemen australia-

  i started up it was dark about me i listened sor-
rowfully to the words that came to my ear then i
had been dreaming after all dreaming about the air-
plane trip the figure of my uncle the strange work of
wenzel aporius i had been in berlin all the time i
had been sleeping seemingly sleeping all day

  i tried to think things out yesterday evening was
it yesterday  it was so long ago my trip came in be-
tween-no i had dreamed that but then that heavy
session with my friends was that a dream where was
i  there must be a loud speaker somewhere-

  if we next consider the australian desert which
stretches in its unproductive wastes from about mt rus-
sell on the west-

  mt russell-what did i know about mt russell
oh that was wliere the radium had been found

  i jumped up then the room became bright not
all at once but gradually a luminosity shone half way

up the room becoming stronger and stronger until
everything was completely lighted

  i was not in berlin i was in the room to which my
uncle had brought me in this disguised cave i was
lying on the couch carefully wrapped in a coverlet and
above me a loud speaker hung from the ceiling it was
a round wooden box such as i had seen in pictures of
american sets but now it was silent

  marvellous i was glad to be here i was glad yet
i had a little homesickness for berlin i scanned the
walls carefully it was indeed remarkable one spot
of the wall was brightly lighted by a beam there were
no electric lights as i knew them to brighten the grotto
there was a glow strange to me-a pleasant brightness
like that of day

  now a sunbeam if i may call it so rested on one spot
in the wall and as i looked at it and stepped up to with-
in about two paces a little door opened a washbasin
came down and cold water flowed into the basin from a
spigot

  after washing i felt splendidly refreshed i tried to
think things over i felt restless and desirous of seeing
my uncle of hearing more of his wonders i felt afraid
that these wonders would disappear

  the loud speaker commenced again this time it was
the voice of my uncle if you are awake come to
me

  i slipped on my coat stepped to the door which opened
for me and went along the passage a glow running
along the wall served to guide me then i came to the
place to which the car had brought me it was stand-
ing there ready

  the door of my uncles room opened and he seemed
waiting for me but he was not alone the american
who had previously been watching the great power plant
was now with him in the centre of the room stood a
supper table set for three

  you had a good sleep

  pardon me uncle i-

  perfectly ail right its a sign of healthy nerves
you look rested now there were all sorts of new im-
pressions-

  i heard the radio and woke up

  mr holbom-you know him from this morning-
tuned in on berlin for you at my request

  i was so startled i was afraid i had been dream-
ing

  were you really afraid

  uncle-

  in five minutes a plane is leaving for germany do
you want to go on it he asked smilingly

  may i not remain

  he looked at me and nodded i was fooling the
plane isnt for you and it isnt going to germany but
to san francisco i have to go there its not a bad
trip only about as far as berlin but im going to make
quick time i hope to be back in eight days

  i think if you are seriously determined on remain-
ing here that mr holborn my second in command
will have the kindness to initiate you into things hell
tell you a lot more and in fact show you what you
need to know

  when i come back i believe mr allister will also
be here with the twelve gentlemen the real work will
commence then its high time for the most important
things must be got out of the way before those clever
gentlemen in canberra wake up to their folly in signing
the agreement with me now for a quick cup of coffee

  my uncle seated himself comfortably there was
	wonder stories quarterly

 nothing in his manner to show that in eight days he was
 going to fly twenty-six thousand kilometers we drank
 the excellent coffee

 then he got up

 good-bye holborn fritz come with me to the car
 for a moment we stood alone together then you do
 want to stay

 yes i do

 very well on my return you will tell me in which
 department you wish to work my boy if you live up
 to the good impression you have made on me-

 a whistle sounded and my uncle laughed

 see once again the machine is my master if i am
 not quick-

 he jumped into the car at once the automatic door
 closed and away the car sped and vanished in the shaft
 a moment later i heard the trap-door opening above
 and walked back into the room mr holborn was
 sitting there with his legs stretched out smoking a
 large cigar he passed me one

to mt russell

 fclljr schmidt is the finest man in the world
 jy he said lazily

 i believe it

 but i know it old boy you must be a lucky fellow
 to have such an uncle and to please him so well

 do i really please him

 he isnt a man to put himself out for people and
 desert city is no nursery many a one has been here
 and left again by plane after three hours right on
 the dot they went literally while you-

 how long have you been with my uncle

 since we shined shoes together in sydney

 shined shoes

 yes sir and its a thoroughly honest job i know
 all about it but i like it better here do you feel in the
 mood to do things

 surely

 how about a little airplane ride this evening

 i laughed to frisco or have you the job of taking
 me over the frontier

 holborn suddenly became serious mr schmidt
 never says anything he doesnt mean he told me your
 contract was in effect

 where are we going

 to mt russell if you like

 i should like nothing better

 old boy you must be proud of this chance mt
 russell the real mt russell is known thus far to only
 two people in the world your uncle and myself

 the whistle that i now knew so well sounded there
 is the car already

 we went up again and again i was surprised for
 it was night i must then have slept many hours but
 it was no longer so hot before us was a plane quite
 different from that in which i had come-a simple plane
 without a cabin designed for the pilot and a companion
 do you know how to control a plane

 yes indeed

 i shall take it over and then i need not explain
 the way there was nobody in sight except ourselves
 the plane rose and glided along fairly close to the
 ground

 is it far i asked eagerly

 we shall be there in three hours that is at about
 midnight mt russell is part of our domain the most
 important part

 beneath us was the desert then came dense bush at

times though very rarely there was a settlement in
the bush then there might be a village with a bright
fire in the square with men and women dancing about it
natives i asked

  cannibals holborn said indifferently

  pleasant neighbors

  at least they are intelligent it also happens that
they dont eat white men they are too salty for them
and taste of alcohol

  i could not help laughing

  i hope that this is only hearsay

  they told me themselves holborn said seriously
their chief is our friend you will make his acquaint-
ance

  slowly the land below us rose and became moun-
tainmous densely-wooded places began to appear and
the moonbeams fell on valleys filled with splendid
flowers

  are there many wild animals

  none at all just kangaroos and the like they get
tiresome to the palate in the long run but to make up
for that fish climb-trees and the frogs bark like dogs
a crazy land this australia it is a bit of the primitive
world handed down to modern man

  the plane descended to the earth we had approached
a group of most remarkable rock formations there
were mountains which looked like uniform cones of once
molten silica and which had the appearance of huge
sugar-loaves or giant pieces of belemnite

  the glass mountains holborn pointed them out
they cant be climbed still at the same time-
the plane descended and the wheels rolled over the
ground lets get out

  on the ground again i looked around a thick bush
was about us we walked along a path a real path
which men had cut in this tropical wilderness it was
already starting to be overgrown

  it was cut only yesterday when the primeval forest
engages him in battle man is almost powerless

  after perhaps an hour had passed the narrow moun-
tain path opened out into a little hollow an extinct
crater said holborn it was a garden of heavenly
beauty never had i dreamed of such floral splendor
but the flowers were without fragrance

  come i have still better things to show you

  we climbed on and presently we stood beside one
of those steeply rising cones

  here is the mine

  a mine

  yes-one that mr schmidt discovered he found
it by chance while he was still going about the island
as a hunter of birds of paradise it is unlike any mine
you have ever seen i think it is about ten thousand
years old

into the mine

  looked at him but he was perfectly serious
ten thousand years he repeated mr schmidt
thinks so too what do we know we creatures who
live but for a day and are so proud of our knowledge
what can we guess of what has been aeons before us
what do we know of the golden fabled atlantis only
what plato tells us from the old egyptians what do
we know of the immense images on easter island  only
that they are there and that it was people of a great
civilization who made them they were certainly not
people living on a little island in the ocean but dwellers
in a great land now submerged what do we know about

   the pointed fossil shell of a cuttlefish
electropolis	

the builders of the palace of palenque still standing
today in mexico on the banks of the usumacinta outlast-
ing thousands of years  what do we know of the people
who lived before the deluge covered the earth and swept
them away what will the people who inhabit the earth
thousands of years after us know about us

  the american had become serious and thoughtful
we were nearing a black hole which opened up in the
wall of the mountain holbom pointed it out

  mr schmidt sought refuge in this when he was
overtaken by a rainstorm it almost cost him his life but
it was the beginning of his greatness

  we entered a rectangular chamber during the entire
trip mr holbom had carried in his hand a rectangular
box which i now learned was a great storage battery
he connected it with a wire and threw a switch a
lamp lighted up

  now we can have light for two hours this battery
wont last longer than that

  i looked about me the chamber was chiselled out of
the rock and its walls were decorated there were great
titanic faces pictured here but none of them were remi-
niscent of the australian race here and there were
even blurred remains of painted pictures then again
there were strange astronomical pictures like crowns
above the stone faces these were of gold and silver
finely inlaid in the rock

  i could not help feeling that i was in a mysterious
temple

  come here 

  holbom had opened a chest which stood in the
comer it was certainly a new chest roughly made of
boards he took out two suits of a material unknown
to me

  put them on

  why they are almost like diving suits

  youll soon see why we need them

  i got into a suit it was all in one piece and even cov-
ered my feet and hands at the ends of the sleeves were
gloves and in front of the face was a stiff mask with
eye-pieces apparently cut from crystal it was a very
uncomfortable suit but holbom put on one just like it

  take the lantern he said giving me an electric
flashlight then he commenced to climb down a ladder

  the ladders are new but the shaft is extremely old
you see it is cut from the living rock

  the shaft was perfectly rectangular and its walls
appeared to be polished it was altogether wonderfully
made at regular intervals the length of a ladder apart
it had a projection big enough to permit us to change
ladders we climbed down five such ladders and then
found ourselves standing in a great room

  we shall be at our destination in a moment

  we walked along a gallery it too was perfectly pre-
served because it was hewn in the solid rock soon i
saw that the ground was dirty underfoot and the walls
were no longer of rock like the floor they were formed
of a dirty bluish black mass which felt like sticky clay

  it was uranium ore pitchblende i had often seen
small samples of it when i was at school pitchblende
that was the substance from which the precious radium
was obtained elsewhere the ore is quite rare and found
only in small amounts but here there was such a profu-
sion of it that a whole gallery had been worked right
into the ore not by us-but thousands or ten thousands
of years before us by some mysterious forerunners
of our race

  here the gallery came to an end after we had looked
about for a while and i had taken a sample as holbom

suggested we made our way back i felt a violent head-
ache as we proceeded and had an inexplicable sick feel-
ing all over holborn then took the piece of pitchblende
from me and wrapped it in a piece of material like that
of which our suits were made not until then did we
take the suits off and climb up the shaft again to the
outer world

chapter vi
a sudden fortune

i breathed more easily when i felt the cool night
air on my brow holbom handed me a pill and took
one himself then he showed me a fine spring
from which we drank

  now you know the wealth of mr schmidt it is
radium pitchblende-from which radium can be ob-
tained in incredible amounts such as you saw there not
grams or pounds of it-it can perhaps be measured by
the hundreds of pounds this amount of radium could
revolutionize the entire world it is well that nobody
but mr schmidt discovered it

  how was it possible that it remained undiscovered
so long

  it is seldom that white men come into these moun-
tains besides you yourself have already realized that
a person cannot approach it in safety the effect of
such an amount of radium due to the rays it emits is
certain death the mountain and its caves which to the
bushman of today are of course caves of the gods and
devils are known as caves of death never has a native
ventured in or if perchance a rash one did it meant
certain death for him

  of course it was just this legend that impelled our
chief to go in he too nearly fell a victim to the demons
of the enchanted mountain he discovered what the
mountain contained and he brought back a sample with
him it caused him severe wounds and festering sores
in his hand but it was to be the source of his wealth
but isnt it strange that the australian govern-
ment-

  the government of course knows as little about the
mine as anybody else holbom interrupted and so
nothing has been changed we simply planted this hedge
of prickly pears which is safer than an iron door because
it allows nobody through and who would want to get
through but you saw the splendid garden here in
between the wild crags and the primeval forest prob-
ably this is due to the effect of the radium on the depths
of the mountain

  but-radium in such quantities-it is incredible -
holbom nodded and these mountains with their
bizarre forms are also a riddle probably millions of
years ago these formations fell to earth as parts of
another heavenly body maybe a comet and in this
outside body which seems to have been a sort of vit-
reous flux the pitchblende remained hidden like a
kernel in a nut it was as if it were insulated by this
covering and thus it remained until our predecessors
made their way to it for the first time perhaps making
great use of it perhaps perishing from it like the
present-day natives however i dont think they per-
ished were this so they would not have decorated the
shaft so well nor the ante-room up above and dedicated
them to the gods

  finding it was hard and to get the stuff out was all
but impossible your uncle confided in me we climbed
down after secretly cutting a path for ourselves through

   	resembling slass
	wonder stories quarterly

the prickly pears in die dead of night we were always
on guard against the local natives because they said
that any one who went into the demons cave destroyed
not only himself but the whole tribe we took along
a glass flask sewed up in asbestos with wooden shovels
we put a litde of the pitchblende into it and fled again
we washed ourselves here at the spring in the precious
radio-active water and made our way to sydney

  there we sold our guns our goods everything we
had and in the cellar of a house we set up a very small
laboratory in this mr schmidt in a manner that i
do not myself understand got the radium out of the
pitchblende

  we were poor devils o so poor i at least had lost
all faith in any fortune that was to blossom forth for
me so you can imagine how i felt when mr schmidt
showed me a litde box and said this is worth five
thousand pounds and half of it is yours

  but that did not mean luxury for us it was better
to toil and go hungry a while longer so we went down
again into the mine to work we soon had so much
radium it must have been worth about half a million
pounds we sewed the little boxes into our clothes and
took jobs as firemen for we did not want to show our
treasure in australia thus we worked our way to san
francisco even when we arrived there we were of
course very cautious there was still the danger that
we should be taken for thieves or swindlers believe me
it was far from pleasant

  we came back to australia with a quarter of a mil-
lion mr schmidt had meanwhile worked out his plan
and revealed it to me i was astounded and afraid i
was once an engineer and i am also one who has made
headway under difficulties but i am no genius like your
uncle if i had found the radium alone i should prob-
ably have sold it in sydney to the first comer taken a
seat in the nearest tavern and drunk until all my money
was gone then i should have repeated the performance
keeping it up until i was dead

  holborn was gazing ahead rather gloomily we were
still sitting by the radium spring and eating a lunch
which he had brought along in the plane

  then you are part-owner mr holborn 

  he looked at me in surprise absolutely not what
did i have to do with your uncles discovery of the
mine i have helped him and he has paid me today he
is paying very well too and i am glad to continue to
help him as well as i can

  i pressed his hand warmly how fortunate that my
uncle found a man like you

  why so because i have not killed him its all
very simple to explain first not every person is a
murderer second i am fond of him and i was already
fond of him as a good comrade when we two came
half-starved to sydney the ship in which he was first
engineer and i was fireman was wrecked and nobody in
sydney would do anything for us absolutely nothing
for the german and not a bit more for the american

  it was a tough time heaven knows shining shoes
until we had got together enough money to buy two
guns and go out into the bush and then-two years
later we had found the radium mine

  and what happened after that or am i too inquisitive
in asking you

  mr schmidt asked me to tell you he himself does
not like to talk yesterday i was surprised at his con-
versation for i dont think he had said so much in the
whole preceding year

a fools paradise

mr holborn laughed loudly it was a rare state
of affairs after we had our quarter of a million
we came back to australia this time we lived in the
victoria hotel then the best hotel in town the next
morning we went straight to the government head-
quarters there was then no capital city canberra i
can still see the face of the commissioner when mr
schmidt presented himself your uncle was dressed in
very fine clothes which hardly went with his weather-
beaten face he looked like a dyspeptic american the
kind you see in the comic papers he began

   excuse me i want to buy some land

  where

 a vitreous mountain in the middle of the desert

   what do you want of it

   i want to build a country house on it

  out in the desert

   yes on the vitreous mountain

   theres a number of them which one may it be
   i want to buy mt russell

  the commissioner laughed a long time just that
one do you know what sort of savages live there
mr schmidt nodded yes they are cannibals

 and what do you wish to pay for mt russell

   i offer you twenty thousand pounds

  it was a few days before the agreement was com-
lete the australian government must have laughed
eartily at the stupid american whom they did not
know to be a german they took the twenty thousand
pounds and mt russell came into the possession of
your uncle the agreement was well drawn but the
officials probably laughed mockingly when your uncle
inserted a clause stating that the mountain belonged to
him with everything on it and it together with a hun-
dred kilometers around likewise the air over the moun-
tain and all the ground under it

  again we fetched out some of the precious stuff
we spent nearly a year in america selling it for even
then your uncle wished to keep the secret then we
came back to australia this time carefully investigating
the possibilities of the desert that was so to speak the
beginning of your uncles great dream we spent two
years in investigations then we found the great cavern
in which we now live we discovered the subterranean
river which we believe to be the overflow of the de
grey river and now your uncle has bought this desert
region with die cave from the government they laughed
at him when he came but they took his money now
we can go to work

  six months later an entire shipload of turbines giant
dynamos and all the rest was in cambridge gulf

  during the two years we had spent in the bush we
had made friends with the savages it was simple enough
nearly all are like harmless children to be sure you
cannot whip them or murder their wives and children
or chase them from their villages the way the whites
used to do when they came to australia well it was
white criminals that the english government sent to
australia and any one who is a thief and murderer at
home is ill suited to making savages friendly with white
men

  we managed it however i dont mean we but only
your uncle i only helped him

  then the heavy machinery was taken over the desert
by a railroad which we laid and afterwards took away
again

  yes sir we already had ten years work in australia
behind us before we could erect this power plant before
elegtropolis	

the chief worked out his great plan before we slowly
and carefully sold so much radium that millions of
pounds sterling were in banks at our disposal and before
the australian government in canberra was ready to
sell this vast territory of course they are still convinced
that it is all nonsense but a million a year from his
wretched desert is to them a million clear profit and
they dont look a gift horse in the mouth

  i looked at the american do you believe that it will
be successful

  holborn nodded and said calmly if mr schmidt
were to tell me today that in a month he would bring
the moon down to the earth i am sure that he would do
it the chief says nothing he cannot do

  he stood up well i think we had better go home
the sun is about to rise and i must look at the power
plant

  leisurely we got into the plane again the sun was
rising a very strange sight at first far back over the
plateau a dark spot and then a disk with a silvery light
rose upward while the sky was all tinted with gay
colors

  how many people are living in desert city now
i asked when we were comfortably settled

  at present four white men five if you count mr
schmidt but he is not here now besides him there are
you i and two servants

  i laughed is that the total population of the city
that is the ruling class he said seriously besides
that there are the workers they are not numerous but
they are very strong

  white workers

  they are mostly black some are red but all are
strong strong dependable absolutely obedient if prop-
erly treated and tireless these workers are our ma-
chines-the turbines-the turbines the dynamos the
great driving wheels and transmission systems the
best of them is the subterranean river which gives its
power to drive all our machines

  and only four persons are here to tend these ma-
chines

  no i am the only one who tends the machines if
i need help mr schmidt aids me the other two are
simply servants they would not be needed except that
visitors frequently come like the english peer yesterday
who think there should be human servants before we
sent home the two hundred american mechanics who
built the power plant under your uncles supervision
we had them fix up the cavern we live in and equip it
with everything which now makes for our comfort
why send away the workers if my uncle is about
to bring his plans to realization

  it is not well to have too many who know what you
know we had sought out these mechanics from all
america five to a city they were not too curious about
things here they like the government in canberra
thought it was all a wild idea and by now they have
probably forgotten all about it now nobody need know
how it all originated and i can tend the power plant all
alone

  there was a silence

  in australia everything is different he said finally
pointing to the sky here the sun rises and sets not
golden but silver that is due to the mist

a marvelous toy

close beside us there now sounded twice and thrice
the sharp crack of a whip and the clucking sound
made by a driver urging on his horses involuntarily

i started and grasped the hand of holborn who was
about to start the motor

  a wagon how is it possible for a wagon to be
coming here now

  the american shook his head absolutely impos-
sible

  but listen

  again there sounded now very close to us the
sharp cracking of the whip and the clucking noise

  i was really very much startled but mr holborn
pointed to a pretty little bird sitting boldly on a branch
right before us it opened its bill and lo the sharp
cracking of the whip and the clucking came from the
little birds throat i started again when i plainly heard
nearby a loud mocking laugh mr holborn joined in
this laugh

  there are no people laughing those are the laugh-
ing jackasses as the popular name is see up there the
black flock in the branches truly they are the cleverest
of birds for i have found that they always laugh at
people who have done something foolish or have been
in some way befooled yes yes dear friend you must
get used to finding all things in australia different from
elsewhere in the world

  he started the motor and while the first rays of
morning were shining over the garden of paradise and
the forest which surrounded the foot of the vitreous
mountain our own artificial bird winged its way up into
the air and soared over the desert toward our cavern

	 

  that morning we went through the entire system of
caves and i had a chance to admire this gigantic power
station in all its details one power station is after all
much like another only this one differed in being com-
pletely arranged for automatic control even a little
natural oil pool was taken advantage of through in-
genious dropping devices it continuously let its drops
fall on the wheels and joints of the machinery mr
holborn had also taken me into a distant room in which
there was a tremendous rushing noise there the cur-
rent of water hitherto confined rushed with all its origi-
nal violence from its stone pipe and vanished in a seem-
ingly endless abyss

  we also went to the kitchen one of the servants
was here but he had nothing to do but watch things
mr holborn nodded and smiled saying here is the
first experiment in trying out the clockwork system
which will someday become the very heart of the whole
land so to speak

  the kitchen was in a great cave with smoothly pol-
ished walls in the centre stood an electric hearth above
it all around containers were fastened to th wall and
each of these had a long arm with a spout-like opening
everything was quiet and the servant was sitting there
indifferently smoking a cigarette

  mr holborn took out his watch with a smile it is
a quarter of twelve do you want to see how our lunch
is prepared 

  with pleasure

  there was a large clock in the kitchen it struck and
at the same moment a shrill bell sounded at that the
whole kitchen seemed to come to life first we heard
the loud clicking of a clockwork the operation of which
was started by the clock-hand

  the hearth also sprang into life a sharp ringing and
then as though pushed by an unseen hand a pot slipped
over the grate only in this case the grate was just
a plate heated by electricity from below a tubular arm
turned over the kettle and let water flow in while at
	electropolis

the same time from another tube cocoa powder flowed
mixed with sugar and milk in exactly measured por-
tions and a rotary mixing device descended from the
ceiling when the cocoa boiled up after a few moments
the kettle was automatically shoved back from the grate

  mr holbom went back with me into the great engine
room that is how the entire meal is prepared said he
thus you may see how pieces of meat are cut by auto-
matically driven knives and thrown in the pan you are
right perhaps it is all a toy but it is a very ingenious
toy and it lias serious value this little clock which
operates all the apparatus in the kitchen is proof that

roast but it doesnt know when the meat must be
washed it can only heat canned vegetables it can cut
open the cans and empty the contents but the same
machine cant clean fresh vegetables also the servant
has to set the lever which tells the machine how many
pieces of meat are to be cut and how long they are to
be roasted the machine carries out all its work won-
derfully but it will never become an artificial man

  deep in though i looked at him saying theres one
more question that troubles me who was wenzel apo-
rius

  i didnt know him ive only heard of him frdm the

uuujtration by pint

the realization of our great plans lies within the realm
of possibility

           chapter vii
           a terrible warning

we had eaten together of meat that had roasted
itself vegetables that had boiled themselves and
this cocoa that had poured itself into the kettle we
had lighted cigars and were sitting opposite each other

only intelligence is lacking holbom said slowly
man must always supervise the machine can cut and

chief he was a great inventor but an unhappy man
he thought out and developed all these machines some-
where in the primeval forest of mexico but his mind
gave way before his own work and when he was alone
with these machines when all human beings had left
him his reason became confused and he thought he had
created not machines but frightful persons who became
hostile to him

 i shook my head in wonder and he went on mr
schmidt made his acquaintance dont question your
uncle about that time i know it is hard for him to talk
of it he made aporius acquaintance when the night

i saw for the first time the most remarkable
fish which in the cool of the night climb up
on the branches of trees 
electropolis	

of insanky was already falling about the unfortunate
man but your uncle marvelled at his work-

  mr holborn was silent for a moment then he said
softly there must have been something else too i
think your uncle nearly became the son-in-law of this
man he does not speak of it he only told me that
wenzel aporius had a daughter who after she had
found him again nursed him until he died then a few
days later she herself was stricken with yellow fever
and succumbed to it

  again holborn was silent then he said hesitantly
at any rate mr schmidt has the right to call himself
the heir of the great inventor and he has never since
looked at any other girl if you some time should see a
womans picture in his room then it is the daughter of
the dead inventor whose work was lost in the primeval
forest i will tell you only one more thing which is all
i know he possesses the diary of wenzel aporius
holborn arose enough of that i think you know
now what you need to know also why your uncle called
you why he longs for you and why you are his hope
holborns voice again became softer and he laid his
hand on my shoulder at first i had taken this man for
a simple employee then at most for an average amer-
ican technician but now a kindly emotion sounded in
his voice

  it is for you to be the assurance that he docs not
meet a fate like that of wenzel aporius he is no longer
young and i am a year older than he man must not
be alone with machines which he himself creates and
which are stronger than himself i believe that a fair
future lies before you 

	 

  i was lying on the couch in my room for the moment
there was really nothing to do the big power plant was
running by itself my uncle was away and mr holborn
had lain down to sleep he had advised me too to take
a nap

  when the others have come the real work will com-
mence i think we will make a trip around tonight

  i had tried to sleep but i could not i felt that i was
afraid to be alone had what i had gone through in the
past few days been too much for my youthful nerves
i was afraid of sleeping or rather of waking again

  how incredible all this was yet how natural think
of this supply of radium unknown to any one sufficient
to revolutionize the world it was incredible yet ex-
plicable i knew that mighty fragments of meteors had
surely often struck our earth in earlier times why
should not this remarkable mountain of a rock re-
sembling glass flux be a meteor of this kind 

  doubtless there are infinitely great stores of radium
on other heavenly bodies why should not such meteors
have fallen in the desert in other places with their
precious contents isolated by chance i got up and
walked up and down my room why should not the idea
about the machines be feasible why should not- 

  i realized that thinking of these machines filled me
with horror and yet i was full of enthusiasm i felt
as though in this moment i could comprehend this plan
of my uncle this faust-like plan of changing a desert
into fruitful land

  the door opened and mr holborn entered you
cannot sleep he said i told you too much at once
drink this

a land of wonders

rwas evening i was again awakened by the fact
that the light slowly brightened up the ray passed
over the wall and the door to the bath opened i now

knew that all this was a sort of alarm clock which did
not ring its bell but instead made things light up and
at the same time switched on the loud speaker this time
i did not get berlin but a melting american negro
spiritual of course mr holborn had again done the
tuning in

  i bathed and went over to him the gleam of light
which went before me and which of course also obeyed
an impulse sent out by holborn or my uncle as on the
day before showed me the way to the dining room i
already knew its secret it was made in exactly the same
way as the moving writing on the squares of great
european cities

  we ate well and talked of indifferent things the
american looked at me searchingly

  did you sleep well

   splendidly

  we ate excellent food with a good appetite and i
asked was all this automatic

   not entirely between you and me the servant is a
splendid cook and as i have already said furnishes the
intelligence factor

	 

  it is now four days since i have arrived in desert
city four days in desert city and five days en route
today was the ninth of april to think that only ten
days ago i had been at my guardians it seemed as if
it must have been years ago i felt like a different person
much older with my views entirely altered-in short a
mature man 

   we were on the coast before me was the same barren
cambridge gulf which i had crossed at my arrival four
years-no four days ago i was sitting with holborn
on the rocky coast looking down at the jagged reefs
surrounding the bay across there was actually a city
here one was modest in estimating what makes a city
here were only a number of sheet iron shacks and the
place bore the proud name of wyndham city

  we had already been more than two days en route
in our trip of exploration this time we did not go by
plane but by auto-in a car with remarkably broad
wheels it was a strange land we had crossed the
desert an endless waste and then we stopped by a lake
how quickly things changed their nature here here
was a wide lake and on it black swans and long-legged
gaily-colored flamingos

  in the morning we camped by the lake putting up
the tent on the shore and preparing our breakfast with
the aid of the water we had spent the entire night
traveling and now we wanted to sleep through the heat
of the day

  how remarkable that there is a lake here

  holborn shook his head saying that is no lake
that is a puddle of rain probably it rained here a few
hours ago

   we noticed nothing of it

  we were a good many kilometers away if it does
happen to rain here which unfortunately happens very
seldom the rainfall is limited to a small area and is like
a cloudburst

   we lay down and slept it was so hot that i did not
sleep well it was not over three hours later that i
awoke

   mr holborn the lake i cried i did not mean to
wake him but i was greatly startled

   the wide lake had vanished instead of it there lay
before us the hard cracked earths crust baked by the
sun-just like what had covered the entire road by
which we had come
	wonder stories quarterly

  where is the lake

  holbom laughed i didnt want to spoil a surprise
for you that is the way australia is i told you it was
no lake but a large puddle of rain the hard ground
does not let the water through at first then the upper
layer softens and a few minutes after that the water
disappears into the granular layer of sand underneath
thats why a rain doesnt bring life here

  thoughtfully i looked out on this desolate expanse
then i pointed something out to my companion what
is that i asked isnt it a struggling animal

  mr holbom looked that way took his gun aimed
and fired it was a swan i have released it

  what was the matter with it

  oh it was just caught in the mud

  the mud

  it ate and went to sleep the swans are in the habit
of sleeping when they are well fed then the water
suddenly disappeared and the sun dried out the mud
just as quickly when the swan awoke it was already
too late its feet were stuck fast in the already stone-
like mud

  incredible

  yet it is often observed i have found flamingos that
were sleeping on one leg and woke up to find themselves
imprisoned thus i have known men who laughed at that
but i always put the animals out of their misery
but it happens so quickly

  it has even happened that men lay down to sleep
then a storm surprised them the ground softened and
when morning came they were lying dead in the mud
that had again become rigid it is not a hospitable land
but it is a land full of wonders

  shant we get the swan and at least eat it

  weve just had breakfast and by noon the heat of
the sun will have spoiled it lets leave it to the animals
and be glad that we have our thermos jars which keep
our food and drink cool many human bones are bleach-
ing in the deserts of australia yet there is one good
thing about the quickly stiffening mud he went on
it has preserved for us the remains of the marsupials
of prehistoric times

               a great plan

it was the cool of evening we were sitting on the
shore and a refreshing breeze was blowing from the
ocean here on the beach grew many wonderful palms
the water was a clear bright blue it rippled over bright
pink and golden sands in it swam gaudy fish looking
almost like gorgeous butterflies pelicans cranes and
black swans were on the beach and in the water won-
derful hyacinths and strange types of large flowers with
dark red calyxes stood among luxuriant ferns while up
in the palms sat loudly chattering parrots

  it was a wonderful evening more glorious than any
i had ever experienced the setting sun had a magic
coloring as it vanished in the slight mists

  this evening i had seen for the first time that most
remarkable fish the flesh of which resembles a salmon
which has lungs and which in the cool of the night
comes out of the sea climbs up on the branches of trees
and thence stares down dreamily with its great eyes

  marvellous australia where the birds are held fast
in ponds by the mud where there is laughter and the
cracking of whips in the trees and where the fish leave
the water and sit up in the foliage

	 

  we were again at home our trip by auto had lasted

	an animal such as the kangaroo with a pouch for carrying its young

six days when we arrived i naturally went first to
the power plant it had been working quietly since it
was so finely planned and constructed that nothing could
really happen to it when we arrived mr holbom
simply pressed a lever in the sheet iron house in a few
minutes came the shrill whistle the trap-door rose the
automatic car came up and we went to the cavern we
could have stayed away a month

   still perhaps that would not have been wise for we
found the two servants dead drunk in the kitchen with
empty rum bottles beside them

   the men were less reliable than the machines

  i sat in my room i had not been out all day i had
lying before me the exact maps made by holbom and
my uncle on them every mountain and every little
stream of water was indicated i sat there measured
with my dividers drew lines and hurriedly wrote down
my ideas

   i knew the entire territory by now it was far from
being all desert for there were great expanses covered
with dense bush i was now all afire for the mighty
task for i was working out a plan for dividing the
land into districts

  strange twelve days before i had laughed at desert
city and now i myself had a number of other cities on
my map and they consisted on paper of sheet iron
shacks

  mr holborn ate with me i have to leave you this
afternoon he said i must go to the coast tomorrow
mr allister is expected with the twelve german engi-
neers and i must meet him

  he did not ask me to go with him and i was glad i
saw him start in the plane it was toward evening and
i stood by the sheet iron hut i did not know where
the servants were perhaps they were again drunk in
the kitchen

   i was quite alone but by now i felt entirely at home
the levers were quite familiar to me i went to the great
engine room i almost felt that these driving wheels
and turbines had become friends of mine

   a shrill whistle sounded somewhere in the air i ran
to my uncles room there was writing on the ground
glass landing in five minutes schmidt

  i took the work which i had been doing during the
past few days and put it on my uncles desk then i
pressed the lever as i had seen him do the door opened
the whistle sounded the car stood ready and soon i
was beside the sheet iron house i was full of delight
for i saw gliding down to the ground the giant plane
which was bringing my uncle back from san francisco

chapter viii

an amazing plan

my uncle had returned i was rather disappointed
at his greeting to tell the truth he simply jumped
out of the cabin of the plane holding a brief-case in
his left hand and extending his right to me how do
you do he said in english

  evidently his thoughts were still over in america
seeing my bewildered face he laughed and said you
are right lad

   but therewith he rushed past me jumped into the car
which was standing ready evidently forgetting that i
was there at all before i could get in the door closed
and the car disappeared in the cave

   i waited patiently until the car returned then i also
went down and stood in the passage a bit doubtfully
because inside i could hear my uncle speaking loudly to
electropolis	

mr holborn it seemed to me that he had quite for-
gotten me i stepped to the door it opened and my
uncle saw me and cried in an impatient tone where
have you been lad we have our hands full why
didnt you come along with me

  you shut the door of the car in my face

  he looked at me and laughed you are right when
i return from a journey-and such a journey is really
the only time in which i actually have the leisure to
reflect-im so full of ideas that i see nothing at all
i had forgotten you

  he held out his hand to me and then i sat down on
a chair beside holborn

  i shall run over it again briefly early tomorrow the
first planes will arrive i purposely telegraphed allister
from san francisco to have the twelve engineers spend
two days viewing sumatra meanwhile we must make
preparations so early tomorrow two hundred gold-
miners from alaska are to arrive i hired these fellows
in san francisco they are poor diggers who were not
making their expenses now that everything there is
big business

  i interrupted him didnt you say that white men
couldnt work here in my travels of the past few
days i had learned by personal experience how incredibly
quickly one became exhausted even through one did
no work

  my uncle nodded you are right but these two hun-
dred miners are a different sort of people they have
bodies of iron as the result of a sort of natural selection
or survival of the fittest they have worked years in
alaska in extreme cold and before that some were in
the mines of africa every one of them has also dug
for gold and precious stones in australia before now

  their bodies are of iron but they are the worst gang
of criminals in the world they are fellows who can
work like devils but then at night they drink up or
gamble away all their money they are freer with knives
than we are with words

  while my uncle was pointing out the peculiar advan-
tages of these people i felt truly astonished and you
are bringing a mob like that here

  he shrugged his shoulders i need them they can
work here i have hired them for three months i prom-
ised them amazing wages if they will dig canals for
me and i also agreed to give them every bit of gold
and every precious stone that they find

  they know australia they know that it is by no
means impossible that they should find gold here at
least they imagine they may at first they wih work
furiously and then some day they will run off their
camp is going to be fine of course we have to provide
them with the necessary saloons and gambling-dens
without which they cannot exist and we must keep a
strict watch on this gang of thieves tell me lad how
would it be for you to show that you are really the
genius allister seems to thinkyou how would it be if
i put you in charge of the colony of gold-diggers and
made you responsible for the entire company

  i must have put on a sorry expression for my uncle
laughed out loud no my dear boy even if you were a
still greater genius you couldnt do that it takes beel-
zebub to deal with devils the director of our criminal
colony will be jim

  i was again amazed i remembered that when holborn
and i two days before had come in our trip through
the bush past a little lake he had shown me jim he
was an apparently very old little man with a leathery
face sitting half-naked on a rock on the shore of the

lake in a very drunken condition apparently engaged
in singing wild negro songs in his drunken screaming
voice to some tame young kangaroos

  are you in earnest uncle

  absolutely

  again my uncle became perfectly businesslike to-
night we must erect the tents in which the company is to
lodge they are not to enter the cavern and they are
to know as little of it as possible i will visit mormora
myself later so that he will help us with his people

a flattering offer

as yet i had never heard of a man by the name
of mormora and in surprise i asked who he was
my uncle who apparently did not like to be inter-
rupted shouted to me before turning again to holborn
the chief of a tribe of cannibals

  then he continued i think two other planes will
arrive tonight in america i hired ten dousers it is
urgently necessary that we bore a large number of wells
for this i need these men with their hazel rods
again i was amazed do you believe in that

  to be sure at present we have twelve engineers
the entire land must be divided into twelve districts
each of the twelve germans must be in full charge of
a district for the present of course each of them must
have human labor until our machines are in action
have you the list of the engineers

  holborn handed him a paper my uncle read it off
making comments morawetz chief engineer from
dresden-he gets two hundred arabs of the riad tribe
they left the port of jeddah for here four days ago
heinrich stobitzer of the brennabor plant-he has two
hundred tuaregs from the libyan desert they likewise
started four days ago from suez walter helding of
the siemens plant-two hundred chinese from formosa
also already en route otto kurzmuller of nuremberg
-two hundred somali negroes on the way from mak-
dichu karl heinze of potsdam-two hundred natives
of malacca who will be here soon ewald komgold of
mayence-two hundred negroes from dar es salaam
that makes twelve hundred men for the present exclu-
sive of the gold-miners for the time being we shall
operate only the six districts lying about us and messrs
gustav bolle heinrich trager kurt linz eugen
moller max herchner and willi mense will each be
assigned to one of these gentlemen as assistants

  and i uncle

  i shall tell you this evening

  i really felt somewhat grieved but i said nothing

	 

  it was evening i was out of sorts holborn was off
for all day in a plane and my uncle had withdrawn
to his room and expressly declared that he did not wish
to be disturbed i sat alone quite vexed to be sure
it was without reason i vainly told myself the truth
about it i had left the technical school only a few
months before and i had given no proof of my ability
of course in the last few days i had constructed great
plans but if mr allister thought me a genius he was
absurd

  nevertheless i had taken such pains in working out
my plan and now probably uncle was not even looking
at it at all

  the loud speaker sounded please come to me
knowing that it was my uncle i got up and went to
his room he had my plan in his hand

   men whose business it is to locate underground wells by means of

instruments
	wonder stories quarterly

  did you write this

  in the last two days yes i thought-

  he smiled oddly you thought you were giving me
a new idea with this plan unfortunately you were
mistaken

  at this i felt aggrieved anew

  on the contrary all these are things-dont look so
disappointed what i am saying to you now is not
blame you may be quite pleased if i tell you that you
worked out the plan of operation exactly as i had
decided to have it i am glad that i did not even show
it to holborn he is a very intelligent person but he
can only carry out what someone has designed for him
i am glad that you understood me you are intelligent
-you have the gift of comprehension i hope that you
will be equally energetic in execution i saw that you
were vexed because i did not give you one of the posi-
tions in charge i have something else for you you
are my nephew you are now as good as a son
to me some day you will be successor you will
now be what they so well term in germany a sort of
junior chief will you assist me and go everywhere
with me are you satisfied lad

  uncle-

  dont apologize i understand that you cant see
into my thick skull come now our plane is ready
tonight i must acquaint you with one of my dear
friends-with mormora the cannibal chief

             	 

  we had flown for three hours just my uncle and i
i steered the plane and he indicated the direction we
had flown northeast and dense woods lay at our feet
in between of course were small stretches of level
stony desert here my uncle ordered me to descend

  just leave the plane here we dont want to startle
our friend for he still has some distaste for the magic
birds of the europeans

chapter ix

the dance of the kangaroos

we walked through the gloomy wood my uncle
holding his compass in his hand we cant miss
them he said they have a different dwelling-
place each month the poor devils

  why dont you take them on as workmen

  its impossible you might just as well hitch a lion
to a plow forcing a free bushman to regular work is
like condemning him to death these savages are like
children they will work but only like a child at play
they must have the feeling that at any moment they
can throw away the toy and pick up another one
compulsion makes them unhappy i have also taken
thought for their future in my will i have stated that
this mountainous region and these woods are to belong
to them and that they are not to be molested they are
not to be civilized either for that would be the same
as condemning such savages to extinction

  uncle stopped speaking stood still a moment listen-
ing and then cautiously and noiselessly leaped a few
paces ahead and crouched behind a tree

  i thought of some danger the more as my nerves were
on edge at the thought of meeting savage cannibals in
the night though my uncle had only laughed at the
suggestion i had put a loaded revolver in my pocket
when we left he had forbidden me to bring a rifle
now i put my hand in my pocket and gripped the butt
of the weapon

  uncle beckoned to me at the same time putting his
finger to his lips and indicating that i should be quiet

all the indian stories of my youth were running through
my head silently i sneaked up to him he softly
whispered dont speak make no sound look over
there

  before us the trees opened up showing a little
meadow incredibly luxuriant at its edge hardly a
hundred paces from us was a herd of about fifty giant
kangaroos

  i had often eaten their meat in the past few days
during my auto trip i had likewise frequently seen one
of these animals fleeing in wild leaps but this was the
first time i had had a chance to see them at close
quarters some of them appeared to have eaten their
fill for they lay at full length on the ground their
muscular hind-legs and tails were stretched out but
their short fore-legs were drawn up so that they looked
somewhat like sleeping people others were hobbling
along comically using their tails like canes to preserve
their balance still others sat up on their tails and hind-
legs with their fore-legs crossed on their breasts while
their gaze was straight upward they almost seemed
to be praying the wind came from them to us which
explained why the leader of the herd did not notice us

  my uncle took my hand and bent close to my ear
now be very still this is a rare sight

  a most remarkable game started out hopped a young
kangaroo cavalier evidently in love with a kangaroo
maiden on his hind-legs and his tail he leaped about
the object of his affections in an incredibly droll man-
ner she sitting still very calmly followed him by turn-
ing her head gazing at him with her extremely stupid
eyes

  now he grew bolder he made a bleating noise some-
what like a hoarse cough hunched down beside her-
it was as though he knelt down-and began to rub her
back with his fore foot-i had almost said with his hand

   miss kangaroo however was a lady very well brought
up she spit at her violent lover and struck at him

still he managed to give her a proper hug with his fore-
legs now they both stood up in this embrace propped m
themselves up by their tails and bleated and shook
their heads as if in confusion

   they really looked almost like a couple about to dance
and their example appeared to be cratagious suddenly
various other such dancing couples appeared on the
meadow

   all they need is a jazz band to play for them said
my uncle aloud as he said it i could hardly restrain
my laughter and right then the leader of the herd uttered
a whistling sound in the same instant the entire herd
had vanished into the bush in wild flight all but one
large animal

   the latter was crossing the field in grotesque bounds
and now i saw that behind it raced a savage clad only
in a loin-cloth when the beast saw him close behind
it it ceased to flee and turned

   i felt sorry for the poor kangaroo leaning against a
tree it stood up with anxious gentle kindly eyes at
that moment a blow of a club fell on the animals head

i wanted to interfere by my uncle held me back the
kangaroo struck out with its fore-legs it looked like
a regular boxing match between the man and the beast
but naturally the savage with his club was stronger and
soon the poor kangaroo lay dead on the ground

   my uncle whispered to me you are right it is cruel
but they have to live and they have no firearms its
electropolis	

all right its better for them to be eating kangaroos
than-

  he did not finish the sentence but stepped up to the
savage who was engaged in getting the animal up on
his shoulders

  hello miami

  the savage jumped up dropping his animal his
startled eyes looking at first glance like a beast of prey
ready to leap when he recognized my uncle he threw
himself on the ground

  kobi he said i learned only later that this was
the expression for master then my uncle began to
speak to him i of course did not understand what he
was saying for it was in the language of  the savages
but i heard him use the name mormora at this the
young man nodded

  since he looked at me with distrustful eyes my uncle
said something drew me close and embraced me while
he put his other arm about the young savage the latter
hesitated for a moment and then he embraced me too
it was certainly a novel sensation

  the young fellow was medium height dressed in only
a loin-cloth with all kinds of gaudy decorations and
artificial protuberant scars on his body he was so thin
that you could see his ribs through his brownish leathery
skin his hair wild and filthy with mud stood out all
around his head like a gigantic wig in disarray

  i had not yet been long enough in australia to find
this embrace other than unappetizing and painful yet
i forced myself not only to endure it but also to return
it since my uncle had brought it about doubtless it
was necessary in order to seal the friendship

  then my uncle perhaps remembering the peace-pipe
of the american indians offered cigars to the young
man and myself smoking we walked along together
in the gloomy wood before long we heard noises-the
screeching of parrots the gloomy howling of dogs as
a matter of fact they were not dogs but dingos-pain-
fully tamed dingos which after all are probably nothing
but domestic dogs become wild and now the wood
grew light we came by a little cornfield after which
we saw the village of the savages

the savages

it was only a number of very simple huts made of
leaves very simple things woven together of the
twigs and stems as well as the shoots of the bamboo
in an open place before the huts were fires over which
kettles hung and about these fires were men and women
no more clothed than our guide all were screaming
together in confusion

  miami uttered a cry and at once all became silent
and disappeared into their huts at once the men came
out again with long spears woven shields and bows and
arrows in their hands while miami ran over to them
we quietly stood still and waited

  miami was now with one of the men who had espe-
cially brilliantly colored welts on his body the latters
hair which was dyed red was adorned with feathers of
the bird of paradise he listened to the report of the
young man and then called an order at which the women
rushed to the kettles and busied themselves in carrying
them away

  my uncle holding me by the hand walked quickly
up to this man who evidently was the chief and greeted
him in english

  i greet my brother mormora

  my white brother is welcome

  let your women go about their work i do not look
into your kettle nor you into mine

  an understanding smile flashed over the face of the
chief and he beckoned the women we squatted down
beside the fire at a sign of the chief a woman brought
corn-cakes while miami broiled a piece of the kangaroo
he had just killed on a spit

  during the next hour we ate the kangaroo meat and
the corn-cakes while the savages devoured the contents
of their kettles i had to force myself to eat the stuff
for i could not rid myself of the idea that it was human
flesh though my uncle assured me it was not

  that seldom happens and they are not now on the
warpath or else they would be painted very differently

  just the same-

  finally uncle took off his knapsack and removed
from it two bottles

  it is poison to them but i cant help it i give it
to them only seldom and in small amounts but today
i need them

  the rum bottles made the rounds and were soon
empty then the drums reverberated and the savages
danced enthusiastically they sprang toward one an-
other clashing their shields swinging their spears in the
air and shaking their bristling hair meanwhile uncle
spoke to the chief and he nodded his head

  again we sat in the plane now on our return the
savages had already started ahead of us running through
the wood at lightning speed with their chief leading
the way

  my uncle said to me they are poor children destined
to destruction they seem to be more bloodthirsty than
they are since the white man has been lord of australia
already for centuries nothing belongs to these people
but the loneliest wilderness there was certainly no
human flesh in the kettles it is only very rarely only
when a serious war breaks out between two tribes that
they become cannibals

  it is necessary that the white man who has not room
enough in his native land should spread out but i am
sorry for the natives the indians of north america
are as good as dead those in south america will die
out the former proud inhabitants of the moluccas
have been rooted out by the dutch likewise the bush-
men of australia will die out-just like the beasts of
the primeval forest it is sad it must be

  it was toward morning that the savages arrived at
desert city-not much later than we holbom admitted
them into the great supply cave whence they took mighty
bundles of canvas and many hundreds of iron stakes

  my uncle permitted the savages to go into the cave
after which the entrances were again carefully closed
and were planted with prickly pears which grow lux-
uriantly in a few days so that the arriving gold-miners
would not be able to find them

  a savage does not steal a savage who is once your
friend remains your friend unless you wrong him the
white mob is of a different breed unfortunately

  morning came now desert city was more like a city
beside the sheet iron shack stood four great tents three
of tnem were each to house four of the twelve german
engineers the fourth was for the dousers several
hundred meters away other large tents were erected
which the gold-miners were to occupy for a few days

  a few dozen native women directed by one of our
two white servants-a man who had lived a wild life
and had been a bird of paradise hunter also-were
engaged in fixing up a kitchen to take care of the
anticipated cooking on a large scale

chapter x
the work begins

two planes had arrived bringing the dousers and
then departing immediately
v they were strange men and at present there
was strife among them some were very modem persons
and had with them apparatus made of fine metal wires
they gave extensive lectures on their subjects and
seemed to have a scientific basis for their work

  the others were in appearance children of nature
they had long hair and wore silk shirts open at the
collar they wore sandals and no stockings with them
they brought rods of birch and willow and now they
all sat in one of the guest-tents and argued one against
another

  i asked my uncle whether he believed in these men
but he shrugged his shoulders i believe nothing but
i also deny nothing i know that the german govern-
ment in south-west africa often used such well-seekers
and they are said to have been successful if they find
subterranean watercourses very well if not then it
was in vain

  things became more and more active here the
twelve german engineers arrived and mr allister with
them i think that he had made a good selection they
were all energetic young men it was an interesting
time when uncle heinrich greeted them he took them
down below with him whereas he simply received the
american well-seekers up in the tents

  in the great cavern that served ordinarily as a dining
room a map of our territory was hung up it was
divided into twelve districts six of which we were to
begin operating first my uncle explained his plan at
first the faces of the engineers were incredulous some
even mocking but they all agreed in the end to these
schemes

  morawetz was to establish a new power station in
the south there was a large lake there carnegie lake
which we had determined did not dry up at any time
of the year my uncle thought that it too was con-
nected with a great underground river or some other
body of water accordingly we were to erect a new
power plant there

  heinrich stobitzer of the brennabor plant who had
formerly been a railroad construction engineer was first
to equip the district lying between desert city and
carnegie lake with a railroad walter helding of the
siemens plant the electrical engineer was to put up
great masts as quickly as possible in the district to the
east of us there we intended to make experiments
with radium for the acceleration of plant growth

  it was a very long speech that my uncle made when
he had finished the eyes of all were alight with en-
thusiasm doubts had disappeared

  my uncle pressed mr allisters hand i think you
chose the right men

  two mad weeks passed often it seemed as though
the sky were filled with airships that were flying about
like swarms of gigantic birds it was well that my
uncle had also bought cambridge gulf since australia
was first inhabited there had surely never been so many
ships in this bay as now new ones arrived daily and
the two hundred chinese working under the personal
supervision of mr allister had their hands full in un-
loading them as fast as possible towing them out of
the harbor again and setting to work on others

  the inhabitants of wyndham across the bay were
envious they had in former days objected to being
sold with the other land to the dyspeptic american
now they were beside themselves to see how a new city
had blossomed forth here in a few days uncle had
named it allister city after its founder it looked as
though some great agricultural exposition were to be
opened here monstrous crates stood about in which
were packed parts of turbines immense dynamos thous-
ands of tons of steel rails electric locomotives parts of
great masts and whole hills of rolls of copper wire

  mr allister went about quietly among all the con-
fusion he was the only one who knew where things
were i realized that if he were to die suddenly now
the work would be delayed for months

  we greeted each other for the first time since our
original meeting

  hello how do you he shook my hand with
a laugh are you already at home in desert city 

the district in the vicinity of desert city soon
acquired a wild look heavens what men the gold-
miners were each had his whole lifes history written
in his face-histories of wild passions frequently illus-
trated as it were by red scars on cheek and brow

  the miners made a peculiar splotch of color in our
peaceful life we and the other europeans preferred
to do most of our work at night and rest by day this
reversal of the normal procedure was rendered easy
by the great clusters of lights erected on high poles
equipped with powerful arc-ights and flooding the land
at night with brilliance while we thus changed night
into day the miners worked out in the burning sun
their wild greedy faces showed no effect of the heat
while their nervous fists gripped about shovels dug
out the earth with glowing eyes they looked through
this dirt letting it sift through their fingers whenever
the overseers who really were no different from them-
selves glanced away a moment occasionally they
actually had the good luck to find a gleaming grain
of gold

  at night when the cool breezes blew in from the
ocean when the dousers would slowly walk along in
the light of great electric lamps hung about their necks
holding their twigs or metal rods and looking like
magicians or sorcerers when the surveyors were hurry-
ing to work when engineer heldings two hundred
chinese were busy erecting the great iron masts and
running the high tension wires-then all was noise and
confusion in the gold-miners city of tents

  in the midst of the city stood a great shed pieced
together partly of sheet iron and partly of old crate-
covers in it was a chinese no one knows exactly
where he had come from at any rate my uncle had
not brought him there

  he had a crafty face and an untrustworthy expres-
sion in front of this shack which he had put up him-
self was a great sign with the enticing inscription
victoria hotel

  of course it was not a hotel but a wretched saloon
all in one big room at one side was a sort of buffet
on which stood all sorts of questionable foods and a
number of bottles of various colored distilled liquors
all with high-sounding names but all containing miser-
able fusel oil

  this part of the room was purposely separated from
the rest by a lattice in the other part tables stood
along the walls where dice were rolled every night
electropolis	

while in the great open space in the centre the gold-
miners did wild dancing together making the music
for it themselves

  my uncle shrugged his shoulders they are a neces-
sary evil said he they dig like the devil

six weeks passed a narrow-gauge railway was laid
with little electric locomotives that drew tiny cars
each of the cars carrying the heavy parts of the new
power stations which we were to build then a whole
ship-load of camels and elephants arrived we were to
make the experiment of introducing these powerful
beasts of burden wireless stations were erected on
mt russell at lady edith lagoon halfway between
mt russell and our central plant which we now called
desert city in the south at carnegie lake and in the
north at cambridge gulf we could now telephone
through a great part of our territory

  four more weeks passed in the meantime the four-
teen hundred colored workmen had been very active
to be sure they semed lost in the vast territory every-
where masts were rising and carrying electricity over
the land everywhere iron drills were eating into the
rock everywhere could be heard the sound of the blast-
ing which was tearing great holes for the canals

  i was almost continually traveling about in a plane
it was one with a very comfortable cabin which at the
same time served me as a work-room it was a wonder-
ful invention of my uncles with walls strongly insulated
and containing apparatus for artificial cooling there
was a whole system of pipe-coils in which sodium
chloride and magnesium chloride solutions circulated
kept in motion by the action of the airplane motor thus
it was pleasantly cool in the cabin even during the great-
est heat of the sun in this plane i went south to the
virginia range and east beyond mt russell as well as
to the teano range in the west where our territory
ended even here great masts were erected everywhere
and high tension wires were laid here the matthews
rays were to serve as a sort of frontier protection in
case it should ever be necessary to keep undesired guests
at a distance

  one evening my uncle called for me to go with him
but this time not by plane it was a saturday and
we never worked on sunday

  it was only a short trip by auto to the region where
helding was working with his chinese everywhere
stood masts bearing great apparatus of remarkable
shapes

  they looked like lamps and were covered above by
great asbestos screens at fixed distances apart over
the ground great sprayers were set up to which pumps
conducted water from recently bored wells

  we stood on a hill and my uncle pointed about with
his hand when i had arrived this had been a wretched
sandy desert now everything was green i had been
here a week before when the first shoots were just
sticking their heads up out of the ground now they
were already little young plants

  do you know what this is it is our first cocoanuf
plantation in those uprights up there are little bits of
radium during the day i let them send their radiation
over the ground which is watered during this time
it is incredible how much growth is accelerated thereby
i think we shall have the first crop in a year it wilt
be only a small one but it will prove that i am right
in my ideas

  then suddenly as he finished a wild noise reached
out ears a wild noise from the tent-city of the gold-

miners we hurried back in our auto a great fire
was blazing up the village of the gold-miners was in
flames

chapter xl

some reflections

to-day it is exactly a year since i arrived in
desert city it seems to me as though it must
have been at least ten years this morning i
looked at myself in the glass i think that if my berlin
friends saw me they would hardly recognize me my
figure has remained about the same thin and sinewy
but my features are much sharper and my face and
hands are leathery

  to-day is sunday and therefore we do not work
holbom is in the south and my uncle has made a
flying trip to mt russell he again needs money and
has gone to his great treasure chamber the old mine

  this time he took with him morawetz whom he has
appointed chief engineer morawetz is surely a very
clever man he is a diligent electrical engineer with
ideas of his own very often uncle sits with him and
works out new experiments frequently signs ap-
pear now that the people over in canberra are becom-
ing curious they proposed to build a railway into our
territory that would not be a bad idea since a line
already runs at laverton near mt margaret and from
there to the southern boundary of our land is only
a few kilometers

  if that were done we would have a connection with
the harbor of freemantle on the west coast of australia
in many respects that would be much more convenient
than our cambridge gulf in the north which often
greatly imperils the ships but uncle does not want
any connection by railroad with the cities of australia
for he does not want the australians to know what
happens in our territory

  certainly they are all inquisitive they mock at us
and shake their heads surely the gentlemen in can-
berra believed that this is all simply a fantastic whim
they are thoroughly convinced that my uncle will soon
lose all his interest in the place that his money will all
be gone and that he will leave the country

  naturally we read the papers which are published in
the large cities of australia the most remarkable
things about us are in them the people already know
that ships and great airplanes we now have also three
large dirigibles continually bring us all possible things
but they have not yet heard of any results from it all
they do not understand whence come the millions
which we possess but they mock at the way we spend
them

 i went up the hill behind our central plant by the
little cog-railway we now have a large number of
such railways they have no rails merely a chain
which runs over rollers and little cars with broad wheels
which can go anywhere these cars are like little auto-
mobiles provided with motors of their own but in front
they have a pole which can be depressed one goes
under ones own power where it is necessary and
where one meets these chains which continually rotate
one depresses the pole this catches between the links
of the chain and the car is drawn along

   it is the same system as was installed in san francisco
to help the street railways along we have already pro-
vided enormous stretches of ground with such chains
this is much quicker than building railways long
metal boxes with a slit on top and the rollers and chain

illustration by paul

           the dousers walked slowly along in the light of lamps hanging from their necks
           they held twigs or metal rods in their handslooking like magicians

built in are simply sunk in the stony ground the
chain is stretched taut and connected with our electric
power station and things are ready for traffic

  this serves very well wherever there is a stony desert
and we have no lack of them here in sandy districts
to be sure it is impossible since there the wind would
at once fill the slit with sand putting the chain out
of commission

  it is very practical for traffic to our harbor for both
small and large cars can use this chain and we are not
forced to any special rail-gauge it is merely a ques-
tion of having the tow-pole fit into the chain for
traffic in the sandy deserts we have immense electric
locomotives and cars built in the model of a tank or
caterpillar tractor of course they move much more
slowly but they overcome every difficulty

  by the chain-road i travelled up the hill the hill
is actually a marvel right in the midst of the everyday
things of our life it is the pride and solace of my
uncle for it is still the one and only answer to our
problem

  the hill has pretty grounds green turf well-tended
flower beds and a very charming little grove of young
cocoanut palms at the same time i remember well

how desolate it looked when i arrived here a year ago
it was nothing but a miserable sand hill at that time
i did not believe my uncle when he told me that this
yellow crumbly stuff was not sand at all but a sun-
dried stratum of humus released from the rocks by
weathering

  daily this whole hill is artificially watered by our
spraying machines and likewise daily for six hours
the radium apparatus works on the hill hence this
wondrous growth in the desert

  we have therefore a proof that it is possible to
cultivate the desert yet we are aware of a disappoint-
ment in this entire district which embraces about ten
square kilometers we have the lookout hill plantings of
wheat com sugar cocoa and coffee and groves of
young palms and eucalyptus trees but it is really only
like a great botanical garden can it really be done
this way over the entire land  apparently not

a growing city

i sit up on the hill here a little lookout pavilion
has been erected and the chain-road runs as far

a vegetable mold which has the capacity of exercising a toila
possibility of absorbing and retaining water
electropolis	

as this at my feet lies desert city during the past
year it has changed much and it is really beginning
to be a little city several streets have been made with
real houses to be sure these houses are not like those
in other countries they came over the ocean all ready
in great sections they are made o metal and have
within the walls a space for cooling purposes which
makes them very pleasant to live in

  this was the patent of an american inventor though
he was laughed at for it my uncle bought it of him
now we live in such houses i have one together with
mr holborn and we have our offices in it

  a little further down the valley stands the great
hangar for the zeppelins it is built of similar material
nearby is the great flying field all in all there are
now about five hundred white men already living here
among whom are about three hundred germans

  desert city is beginning to look like the centre of
a spider web in all directions run narrow gauge rail-
ways at present they total one hundred kilometers
another network of rails runs in a circle around the
outside and joins them all together we intend to
start cultivating this first circle our first farm in a
few months at present the engineers are building
four great concrete towers at equal intervals over the
circle mighty pipes are being laid from our central
station to these towers

  slowly comes the evening i look down at the
brightly lighted city which is slowly blossoming out
it is certainly a remarkable city in which there are no
women but only busily working meu at least there
are no european women

  i cannot help thinking of the evening when i stood
up here with my uncle die evening when the riot among
the gold-miners broke out we raced down hill with
the auto but all was really over by the time we arrived
the light tents had quickly burned the gold-miners
had vanished collectively when we cleared away the
ruins we found several dead bodies among them the
keeper of the gambling den and also unfortunately
old jim

  the rest were off and away and they remained ou
of sight it is certainly hard to find two hundred people
in so vast a territory uncle shrugged his shoulders

  it is not my fault he said if they lose their lives
they will attempt to dig gold somewhere on their own
account it was a mistaken effort on our part to dig
canals here human labor here is useless

  likewise the well-seekers returned home six months
ago at any rate they did some good for we have
bored twenty productive wells for the present these
wells are a sort of oasis in the roads across our territory

  my uncle is at mt russell with chief engineer
morawetz they not only want to fetch a new supply
of pitchblende from which we now obtain the radium
in the special chemical laboratories in our central station
itself but they also want to plan other things

  recently chief mormora visited my uncle several
times these are always very remarkable visits for
the chief is accustomed to appear in full warpaint and
has with him a few young warriors likewise tena
ingeit the conjurer in an extremely fantastic costume

  mormora always sends the young warriors ahead
then my uncle goes to meet him quite solemnly and
personally conducts him into the old cave where uncle
still lives

  i notice that many of the europeans are surprised
to see the friendly manner with which our chief deals
with the chieftain of the savages mormora dwells with

his tribe even now in the forest and bush about mt
russell eternally guarding as it were the old mine

  he is certainly a good guard for to him this mine is
an abode of the old gods and the precious radium is
worthless so far as he is concerned he was there
several times in the past few weeks he saw white
men snooping about near the mountain probably they
were some of the gold-miners who are still swarming
about the neighborhood

  once we even found a dead man in the mine the
rays had killed him the chieftain said that the god of
the mountain had judged him

  it is necessary to be cautious there are too many
people here at present and we want to try out the
effect of the rindell-matthews rays which perhaps later
will protect our whole territory from enemies

ambitious plans

a high tension cable has been laid from our central
power station to the mountain chief engineer
morawetz is now to install the apparatus i do not know
why i have such a distaste for morawetz he is cer-
tainly the most industrious of all and uncle treats him
with distinction but i do not like him- his eyes are
deceitful and he always has a mocking expression on
his face even when talking with my uncle

  once i mentioned this to holborn i am very fond
of honest old holborn but he only laughed and replied
are you jealous of morawetz

  that vexed me and since then i have been silent
about him i should not like my uncle to imagine that
i am jealous

  there are a few others among the engineers whom
i do not like and they are actually the best and most
industrious am i really jealous of them they are
stobitzer helding and kurzmiilier these three have
accomplished remarkable results but on sundays they
are always together gambling away all their salary
scolding about the work and making fun of uncles
plans

  of course they do not do this openly we now have
a club in desert city-for drinking purposes-a sort
of saloon it is really intended only for the airplane
pilots having a separate drinking room for the camel
drivers and for the mahouts of the elephants for the
actual officials a great casino has been built containing
also guest rooms

  our two former servants are running these two
houses one manages the casino the other the lodgings
and saloon in which there is of course gambling as
well as drinking

  the saloon manager is the same servant who first
received me on my arrival he often talks with me
from him i know that morawetz stobitzer helding
and frequently kurzmiilier as well often spend the
entire sunday playing cards in the room for the camel
drivers i regard that as undignified i am not the
only one who thinks so for i find that the other en-
gineers are not intimate with them it is a pity since
they are the best workers of all

  six months more have passed the days are much
the same and we are making slow progress

  sometimes i arrj worried about my uncle he sits
all day at his plans and allows himself only a few hours
of rest during the cool of the night we are often
traveling about together

  to-day was an interesting day chief engineer mora-

the keeper or driver of an elephant generally a mohammedan
	wonder stories quarterly

wetz completed the high tension system at mt russell
and we all gathered there it was a regular party in
the country the whole force celebrating it even mor-
mora was invited with his whole tribe

  there was actually little to see an artificial cave
was blasted in the pointed chimney-like cone of the
vitreous mountain above the entrance to the mine and
the old aztec cavern we called it tliat though we
well know that it was not aztecs who built it still
we do not know what sort of persons left behind the
sculptures which after all have some resemblance to
those of the aztecs

  in this newly made cave morawetz with the assistance
of helding set up the great machines which are fed
by the current from our central plant these are to
produce the rindell-matthews rays

  we all assembled in the garden below which to-day
is green and blooming in the same heavenly beauty as
when i first saw it morawetz was inside at his machine
a shrill whistle sounded the signal that he had switched
on the rays

  we had built a large number of little airplane models
we had also erected a machine temporarily connected
with the high tension circuit with which we governed
the little model planes which of course were unmanned
this was the same invention as was tested by the ger-
man inventor wirth years ago on the wannsee near
berlin long before the war

  during the war it took a very different development
it simply consists of building into the airship a receiv-
ing station which is exactly tuned in wavelength to
the sending station on the ground every controlling
movement sent out is received by a carefully worked
out relay this again releases the automatic rudders
which are stabilized by the use of gyroscopes to be
sure these little plane models are very expensive but
that does not matter to us

  from the mountain came a loud even humming sound
it was the warning signal which is known to all the
inhabitants of our territory also to our savages every-
where about the mountain are great signs when the
humming sound comes from the mountain do not
approach for it is dangerous

   at first we were disappointed most of all the savages
then we saw morawetzs dog he was down with us
but suddenly he went to look for his master before
we could call him back he went running toward the
mine all at once the dog seemed entirely surrounded
by a confusion of tiny little flashes of lightning then
he was wrapped in flames and in a few seconds he
was consumed

  we were sorry for the poor dog startled and yet
enthusiastic we had mixed feeling about the success
of our machine

  the experimental planes were launched some went
very low close to the bush others higher and still others
higher than the mountain twenty such little models
were simultaneously directed toward the mountain from
all sides at various heights alt just the same moment
all twenty caught fire and burned up in a few seconds
it was just as though an infernal invisible wall sur-
rounded the mountain

  uncle laughed i think our radium is safe he said

  the savages trembled in mortal terror the chieftain
hardly dared shake my uncles hand when the hum-
ming now ceased and morawetz came down from the
mountain unharmed the natives fled from him as though
he were a devil

chapter xii
what was overheard

during the night the four of us-uncle mora-
wetz holborn and i-put on the finishing
touches there is a completely concealed connec-
tion running from the machine in the mountain to the
little grotto in which the soda spring flows out we have
equipped this connection with a switch the position of
which is known only to the four of us now we can
switch on the machine from the outside and know from
the humming sound that the mountain is protected
the guard at the radio tower which is very close to the
mountain hears the humming and can at once inform us
if the machine stops working but we know our re-
liable machines it is quite sufficient to look at them
once in two weeks

  that evening my uncle put something into morawetzs
hand it turned out to be a large sum of money for
uncle is generous but i was again vexed morawetz
sat in the camel drivers saloon and gambled until early
morning--not merely with the other three engineers who
are his friends but with a couple of fellows with very
forbidding faces i should be willing to bet that they
were two of the runaway gold-miners

  chance occasioned my taking a message from my
uncle to one of the mahouts for otherwise i never enter
this saloon the company was so drunk and absorbed
in their game that they did not even notice me the
two men whom i took for gold-miners must have found
something after all for they had before them little sacks
from which they poured grains of gold upon the table
i saw their crafty glances and their malicious smiles
as they shuffled the cards

  it was nothing to me if the four engineers were so
silly as to gamble away their money but it grieved me
that they should do so with such scoundrels

  when i left the saloon i went quickly by plane to
allister city on cambridge gulf it has developed
finely and is much larger than desert city of course
the chinese live here-over a thousand of them-for
here is the office for the care of freight we are glad to
have the foreigners live here on the shore we do not
want any of them inland until we have made more
progress here mr allister rules as a sort of king

  it was sunrise when my plane again landed in desert
city it was sunday we had purposely held the in-
augural ceremony at mt russell on saturday as i
was going home from the airport i saw two men stag-
gering along before me to my disgust i recognized
morawetz and stobitzer morawetz was in an angry
mood and was cursing away

  all the money has gone to the devil the old man
was not stingy a hundred thousand marks in a night
it would have been best for me to have taken the first
lane to europe i am a wretched fellow a miserable
um

  i felt a repulsion toward him when he is drunk he
goes on an orgy of repentance stobitzer comforted
him mumbling indistinctly

nonsense-you do not need to give it a thought

  why not

  you are right at the source of supply

  what do you mean

  just need to shut off the current you know how
not a bad idea-what difference if the old man has a
pound or two less

in a sudden outburst of wrath morawetz seized him
electropolis	

by the collar are you persuading me to become a
thief

  stobitzer shook him off nonsense we are both
drunk

  purposely i was keeping a bit behind them it was
certainly better that they should not see me they did
not need to know that i had overheard them though
it was very probable that by the next day they would
have forgotten everything

  i went back to my dwelling the pretty house in which
i live with holbom it even has european furniture
the junior chief of new australia lives like a prince

  i felt grateful to my good uncle heinrich i hoped
that his great plan would succeed

  but when i thought of the two drunkards i was
alarmed should i speak about it to holborn he
would simply laugh at me and say that they were both
drunk should i tell my uncle it seemed a base thing
to accuse others i preferred to keep my eyes open and
to watch them myself

the great trial

again my uncle had a great day it was also a
jubilee for me too almost two years had passed
since i came here on this day the first test was to be
made now that the network of rails was completed
the great agricultural machines stood ready on all these
tracks there were immense things like steam-shovels
with arms rotating on an axle these arms holding steel
shovels with very sharp edges these were intended to
break up the ground first behind them stood others
intended to break up the clods still more and turn them
over again behind these stood harrows with sowing
machines last of all

  on all the many lines of track running out in all di-
rections from the centre of the spider web the apparatus
stood exactly in the middle at the central point was a
platform on this stood a table with the same spider
web repeated in miniature here was a great number
of electric buttons my uncle stood there surrounded
by his twelve engineers my two friends holborn and
allister and myself

  this was the day when this first circle two kilo-
meters in diameter was to be planted for the first time
our faces were tense those of most of the engineers
being a bit mocking there was a buzzing sound in
the air for the first time we had invited guests even
some from canberra uncle had sent a great zeppelin
over there lord albemoon who had not visited us
since the signing of the contract was coming himself

  the airship descended and shortly afterward the
guests of honor drove up before our platform in an
auto

  i did not want to make your lordship wait said
uncle we shall start right away

  the peer looked about him and cast some sarcastical-
ly smiling glances at mr spencer his secretary

  may i ask what is to happen here

  first we are going to make a cornfield out of this
circle the diameter of which is two kilo-
meters

  well well

  therefore we shall first till the soil by automatic
means and then sow it

  his lordship could hardly conceal his mockery

  and you believe do you most honorable magician
that something will grow here

  certainly this mellow ground which lias been
unused for thousands of years is splendid humus
assuredly so but i have been told that any soil
must be sufficiently watered before anything can thrive
on it

   you are perfectly right of course

  then perhaps you plan to spray about a bit with
watering pots

  the jest was now quite evident but while i felt
vexed and the other engineers who did not have much
faith in our success showed painfully affected expres-
sions uncle replied very calmly

   of course i am first going to make it rain i shall
do it as in the tropics i shall make it rain for two
hours each day at exactly the same time that will
suffice for the present

  lord albemoon became serious and looked searching-
ly at my uncle you are going to do what he
thought him insane

   make it rain of course that is not too difficult for
the present advancement of science will your lord-
ship permit us to start 

  the peer fell back heavily into the armchair pro-
vided for him i am curious to see it

  please have the kindness to look at those towers
through this telescope

   there were four immense rectangular towers erected
at equal intervals they looked something like great
cable towers used in mining also somewhat like towers
each floor of which was a hothouse

  now i am switching on the power said my uncle
pressing a button for some time there was nothing at
all to be seen but then uncle said if you now look
at the towers is there not already forming over each
of them a little stratum of mist in the glowing sun
which is now blazing down on the towers you can make
out very well the vibration of the air

artificial rain

we all looked at the towers all four were now
crowned with very small white clouds from
minute to minute these clouds grew larger turning
darker and spreading out on all sides great shreds of
clouds which were by now black rainclouds stretched
out over the open place strangely enough they did
not all go in the same direction but all went toward
the centre being evenly distributed over the circle
spanned by our network of tracks the four towers
themselves always seemed sunlit and they continually
had new clouds forming over them first light colored
then becoming darker

   a half-hour passed then a whole hour while we all
watched breathlessly the whole sky was black with
clouds

   will you permit me to make it rain now

   no one replied and my uncle fingered other switches
there were flashes of lightning and thunder rolled above
us at the same moment the rain poured down splash-
ing on the dry ground spattering in our faces rebound-
ing from the earth in pearly drops involuntarily the
lord drew his coat closer and my uncle smiled

   it was a good thing after all your lordship that i
had this platform covered with a roof you thought it
was only for the sun but i made it for the rain just
be patient a bit i have shut off the towers i shall
make it rain again during the night and to-day we
shall have a kind of gala performance
wonder stories quarterly

   slowly it became light the clouds brightened up
 and the rain vanished completely it was once more
 as sunny as before

   uncomprehendingly the englishman looked at my
 uncle

   how was that possible

   the entire affair is very simple clouds are formed
 by the evaporation of water through heat you can
 try that out very simply with any tea-kettle therefore
 i raise water into these towers through very fine pipes
 in countless little cables this water is electrically
 heated en route and flows out at the top of the towers
 in a very thin layer over electrically heated plates which
 at once bring it to a boil thus arises the water vapor
 constantly replenished by the water flowing after in
 the air which is heated by the sun it of course collects
 together into clouds
electropolis

  thus far all is very simple but now comes the dif-
ficulty you have already seen that the whole circle is
surrounded by some airships these are very ordinary
captive-balloons but they are connected with electric
current they have apparatus through which i send
waves out into the air which prevent my artificial clouds
from blowing away then by means of electric sparks
i produce an artificial thunderstorm the air is sud-
denly cooled and the rain falls

  all in all it is a perfectly natural process if only
the necessary machines are available above all the elec-
tric current which furnishes heat and power

  uncle worked his levers automatically the steam
shovels were set in motion first and dug up the ground
which had been softened by the rain after them came
the plows the harrows and the sowing machines very
slowly and perfectiy evenly all these giants moved ahead

on all the tracks digging plowing harrowing and sow-
ing

  when the machines reach the outer circuit the tracks
will move sideways just as used to be done in the con-
struction of the panama canal by the amount of a
track-breadth then the apparatus comes back again
the same way thus the entire district will gradually be
cultivated no human hand is necessary except that
of the one who stands here on the platform in the
centre and controls the whole operation even this
man will no longer be necessary in the future my
nephew is just now constructing the clockwork which

takes his place

  it was late in the evening for the first time my
uncle gave a ceremonial banquet to his guests it took
place in the big new hall of our casino-hotel it was
his wish to keep his australian guests as long as pos-
sible

  of course there were speeches made at this banquet
it was hard for the emissary of the australian common-
wealth to have to toast this american whom he after
all would have liked better to have cursed he was
enough of a man of the world to hide his feelings 
gentlemen i bow to the technical miracle which

illustration by paul

there were flashes of lighting from the towers
and thunder rolled then the rain poured
down splashing on the dry ground


wonder stories quarterly

i have witnessed to-day you will not think it ill of
me if i am still expectant and as i frankly admit mis-
trustful about the further effects of the things whfch i
have seen here

  two new cities have arisen in this continent can-
berra the capital of the great and noble australian
commonwealth which i have the honor to represent
and desert city the capital as it were of the wastes
you will permit me to empty my glass to the welfare
the blooming and the thriving and the continued good
feeling between these cities

rumors of trouble

y uncle arose

my heartiest thanks your lordship for your
charming words and now one thing more to-day
you have come not only to a rebirth of this poor coun-
try but also to a baptism you are quite right in speak-
ing of the might of science the name desert city the
city of the wastes will henceforth be unsuitable for
our settlement henceforth this city shall be called
electropolis the city of electricity the city of science
the city of iron arms which serve mankind as you quite
correctly remarked noble lord it is the city of technical
wonders

  may it be a peaceful competition between us can-
berra the capital of an established state relying on
tradition and supported by a well-tried government by
the power of the british empire by all the means which
hitherto have seemed necessary and indispensable and
electropolis the city of the new ideas the city of the
mind the capital of a state which will never carry on a
war which has no weapons and is without ambitions
save to be an example of unconquerable power to the
world despite its peacefulness-an example of peaceful
work an example of humanity and of the victory of
the mind over the low power of brute force

  i have the honor to repeat the toast of his excel-
lency the noble lord albemoon i empty my glass to
the health of canberra the capital of australia and
electropolis the city of science

  the lord and his companions raised their glasses with
mingled emotions albernoon smiled slightly he re-
frained from saying what he thought at this moment
the man is nothing but a lunatic after all lost in
fantasies

  on this occasion uncle heinrich needed no electrical
apparatus to guess the thoughts of the englishmen he
also smiled but inwardly he was very joyous

  i left the banquet for i had much to do at this time
i took my turn at controlling nature i made it rain
for several hours and switch on the apparatus releasing
the rays from the little bits of radium up on the poles
each of these sent the rays over a wide area

  morning came our guests had spent the night in
the casino-hotel the dirigible was ready to take them
back to canberra

  uncle gave them a pleasant smile may i trouble
you to go to the platform once more

  they all stood rigid in amazement and wonder over
the entire circle was a light green growth the seeds
had come up

  uncle smiled again the tropical sun speeds up
growth

  we said nothing about the radium lord albernoon
shook his head you are a magician said he

i simply seek to make the forces of nature service-
able to me it is a very small beginning i should like

to live to see my whole territory becoming fertile land
in the same way

  our guests went back again to canberra by zeppelin
we again had a sensation but this was of a very
different kind this time the newspapers gave it to us
in immense headlines

  the radium mountain in the desert-how lord
albernoon for a few pennies sold countless billions to
mr schmidt of san francisco-the german king
of australia-mr schmidts billions which fell from
heaven

  it was like that in all the australian papers heaven
knows how it got out but soon the whole world knew
the source of our wealth even many who were living
with us now learned for the first time the secret every-
one was excited except my uncle

  i was with him what will happen i asked
  nothing at all

  the australians are boiling with rage

  let them boil 

  what if they attack us

  now you know why i was so insistent on getting the
high tension wires for all our rays around the territory
who can have betrayed us

  perhaps the gold-miners i do not know

  the australian papers were full of nothing but the
radium discovery parliament assembled and the op-
position party was hard at work lord albernoon was
summoned back from his leave of absence as quickly
as possible

  i should not want to be in his shoes says my uncle
calmly going to bed the rest of us in great excitement
stood around the loud speaker in the big hall of the
casino to hear the course of the session of parliament

chapter xiii
cancel the agreement

there was an extremely stormy session in the
parliament at canberra the opposition could
not be quieted

  it was an incredible piece of folly

  we ask lord albemoon whether he has the right to
give away the property of australia

  we should like to be informed how many millions
his lordship personally obtained in this piece of busi-
ness

  his lordship beat on the table with his fists i
deprecate such a suspicion my hands are clean
then your lordship was not even businesslike on
your own behalf

  their voices became more and more excited there
had never been such an uproar in the australian parlia-
ment in vain the president used his gavel in an effort
to obtain quiet at length the leader of the opposition
won a hearing for himself by means of his mighty voice

  we insist that lord albernoon be instructed to
cancel the agreement with mr schmidt under any cir-
cumstances let the latter along with his friends and
co-workers be deported as troublesome aliens we
insist that his lordship be given a week for carrying this
out

  an unheard-of thing happened for the first time
since the origin of this parliament a motion of the op-
position was carried by the unanimous vote of all the
members

lord albemoon was pale but perfectly calm of
course i obey the vote of this honorable house but i
electropolis



 demand that i be given in advance absolute authority to
 adopt any means that seems necessary

 any at all

 lord albernoon again glanced over the assemblage
 took his brief case beckoned to harry spencer his
 secretary and left the government building

 an hour later the prime minister lord albernoon
 was in his office ready to go on a trip before him stood
 harry spencer

 is the plane ready

 yes your lordship

 how long a trip is it to electropolis  

 about sixteen hours it is about two thousand kilo-
 meters

 it is now six oclock we shall travel through the
 night and be on the spot at ten in the morning will
 you arrange to have our coming announced

 i have already ventured to do that

 the lord put his hand on his secretarys shoulder
 this is the hardest step i have ever taken

 the secretary shrugged his shoulders

 a german engineer and you-the most skilful
 diplomat whom australia has had in many decades

 i wish you were right

 he sighed heavily as they enterel the cabin of the
 plane

 for almost a week i had been working from morning
 until late at night on the great clockwork which was to
 become the heart of our agricultural establishment so
 to speak the general control of all our machines this
 entire week i had hardly come up to the world above
 i had even taken my meals in my laboratory

 now uncle henrich came in i had not seen him
 during the-week since he had been busy with other
 tasks this day he seemed to me especially gay

 finish up for to-day lad

 i cannot uncle i have perhaps tvvo days more to
 work and then we can start to operate it

 it will just be a day later that is all

 i was amazed uncle heinrich who found every
 moment so precious was himself putting it off

 what has happened

 he laughed heartily i am going to have you attend
 a theatrical performance

 i was surprised beyond measure a theatrical per-
 formance

 it is a pity that you were not with me yesterday
 afternoon i enjoyed the radio very much

 at that i began to feel a bit anxious but my uncle
 read my glance

 no lad i am not a bit ill my fun with the radio is
 actually just as serious a matter as the enjoyable per-
 formance which i shall show you to-day the truth
 is no more nor less than that very shortly lord alber-
 noon the australian prime minister and plenipoten-
 tiary will arrive here and in person will presumably
 declare war on us under the instructions of his govern-
 ment

i caused the fall

 ow i was really startled war 

 that is all right it will not endanger us at all
 he stepped to the table where my work was set up
 and calmly absorbed himself in what i had been doing

 very good said he i think you understood per-
 fectly what i want

 there was a sharp ring of a bell and my uncle took
 my arm

   now come he said

  at once we were in his office looking at the ground
 glass screen on which a message appeared in german
 australian plane just passed-musgrave range out-
 post

   i reflected a moment it is about three hundred
 kilometers from here to the musgrave range they
 will therefore be here at about ten

   uncle smiled strangely i think they will be an
 hour or two late we shall have plenty of time to
 make a close inspection of your work

   he sat down at the telegraph the words which he
 sent out appeared in writing on the ground glass have
 auto ready go to aid of plane bring occupants at
 once to me schmidt

   i could not understand surely the plane is not
 wrecked is it

   not yet but apparently it will be in an hour now
 come to your clockwork

   from his expression i could see that he did not wish
 to be questioned

   with the greatest calmness he spent an hour testing
 my work suggesting an improvement here and there
 praising other points until at length he looked at his
 watch and stood up

   will you come with me to the engine room 

   mr holborn was already waiting for us his face
 was just as odd as uncles

   all ready

   yes mr schmidt

   uncle stepped to a great switchboard and busied him-
 self at it meanwhile the light in the room went out
 while it was replaced by a brilliant illumination of a
 ground glass screen over the switchboard

   i saw a plane slowly crossing the sky it moved
 slowly because such a great expanse of sky was visible
 i could hear uncle continually working the switches
 while the plane slipped into a spin and landed on the
 earth shortly afterward a cloud of smoke became
 visible then the engine room was lighted up again
 and nothing could be seen on the screen

   at the same moment the signal bell rang again and we
 returned to uncles study again there was a message
 on the great screen of ground glass australian plane
 just fallen and burned occupants unhurt rescue
 car from musgrave range already on spot arriving
 electropolis as quickly as possible lady edith lagoon

   i looked at uncle in horror then you knew before-
 hand that the plane would fall

   of course since i myself with the aid of the rin-
 dell-matthews rays caused the fall or rather the forced
 glide and the subsequent fire

   but why

   simply to provide his lordship with the pleasure of
 a little auto ride in the blazing sun

   but uncle

   not from maliciousness there is a very important
 reason which you will learn later

   we went back to work and uncle seemed to be think-
 ing of nothing but my clockwork meclianism

   at eleven-thirty the bell rang again australian auto
 passed holborn plant

   uncle jumped up they will be here in twenty
 minutes and i must change my clothes we cannot re-
 ceive an english peer in a working jacket you change
 yours too
wonder stories quarterly

a serious conference

in half an hour we were standing up by the sheet iron
shack waiting for the approaching auto it was an
open car with no top and the lord and mr spencer
looked completely fagged out my uncle bowed deeply
how do you do your lordship

  the minister tried to smile

  we are roasted the devil only knows what sud-
denly went wrong with the plane i am grateful to
you mr schmidt for having your auto come so quick-
ly to our rescue

  uncle smiled cordially

  may i first offer your lordship a cool bath

  a noble idea

  i have also ventured to put out fresh linen for your
lordship of course it has never been worn i sus-
pect-

  now the lord actually smiled you are a most at-
tentive host since i planned to stay only an hour i
have not even a suitcase with me

  our two servants this time in formal livery con-
ducted the lord and his secretary into the two lavatories
prepared for them and we went back to uncles room
i had never seen him so much pleased as now

  half an hour passed uncle was standing before his
desk i before the secretarial table in the background
as the two servants brought in the lord and his secretary
in the new tropical suits and refreshed by their baths
they were again very cheerful

permit me mr schmidt to introduce the first sec-
retary of the australian foreign office mr spencer
in exactly the same tone uncle heinrich replied
your lordship will permit me to introduce my nephew
the first secretary of my domain

  the lord and mr spencer seated themselves in the
armchairs we sat down at our desks and uncle opened
the conversation

  has your lordship been so kind as to bring me in
person the receipt for the complete payment which i
have made ahead of time

  the lord made a perfectly evident effort and said
on the contrary i have been instructed by the aus-
tralian government to place again at your disposal not
only this final payment but also all your previous pay-
ments and to declare the agreement with you as void i
have the money with me and mr spencer will be kind
enough to-

  uncle again smiled very cordially then i am doub-
ly happy said he that you did not come to grief in
the plane-all that money

  the lord looked at uncle in amazement again he
started to speak and now began the strangest conversa-
tion perhaps which i have ever witnessed that is to
say only my uncle did any actual speaking the lord
and the secretary only made timid attempts from time
to time to interrupt him the less they succeeded in
this the longer he talked and the more horrified they
looked

  your lordship wishes to explain to me this sudden
change in the views of the australian parliament is
your lordship seeking words that is not necessary
we are human beings you and i

  therefore if i-

  no my lord said uncle becoming serious the
agreement was not based on any false pretences rather
you were extremely glad when i offered you the vast
sum for the worthless desert

  you should have-

  i did i bought mt russell from you outright

  but-

  yes indeed it is perfectly clearly stated look
at the agreement the mountain just as it is the
mountain with the air above it and the earth beneath it
even mining rights are mentioned in the agreement
though that was not at all nesessary

 we-

  uncle leaned back comfortably and laughed yes
my dear sir if you did not know what treasures the
mountain contained that is really not my fault to the
best of my knowledge an english captain named arthur
philip founded a colony in australia as long ago as 
from this later on the australian commonwealth de-
veloped the english have never once left the country
since and so you had over one hundred and fifty
years to learn what treasures your country contained
it is not my fault if you did not do this and i am not
responsible for it i who came here only a few years ago
being nothing but a simple hunter of birds of paradise
yet learning more about your country than you your-
selves and finding that ancient mine

  it was your duty-

  no your lordship it was not my duty i came to
you and asked you the price of mt russell with every-
thing on it and in it you set a price certainly a price
which was ridiculously high for a simple heap of rock
in the desert

  j 

  quite right you thought i was a crazy american
whom you could fool

a final word

while i sat there with open mouth my uncle
seeming to me in this hour just like a demon a
supernatural being and while mr spencer wore a look
of absolute horror albernoon sprang up i had per-
ceived that he was losing his composure more and more
with every sentence my uncle spoke now his nerves
were completely out of his control he almost shrieked
sir how dare you claim to read my thoughts

  uncle had also got up smiling very ironically he
said have i perhaps been wrong have i not read
every one of your thoughts have i not given you an
exact answer to every question before you asked it

  j 

  you know that i have been right and perhaps you
will now concede that a german is not so stupid as an
english peer assumes

  the lord did not reply and my uncle went on as
to the rest even if you were right even if you could
show me a clause in your laws stating that an english
parliament is not justified in disposing thus of aus-
tralias mineral wealth even then you would be wrong
i purchased mt russell from you purchased it legally
but mt russell is not a part of australia

  excuse me sir-

  no it is not a part of australia it is a meteor a
vast meteor which probably fell here from some dis-
integrated planet to call things by their right names
does the soil of australia perhaps contain radium
not that you or i have ever heard the radium i found
in a great meteoric rock which i purchased as is with
everything in and on it explicitly stated so you have
absolutely no claim to make on me and i regret that i
must insist on my contract if you withhold from me
the receipt of parliament i shall just have to content
myself with the fact that i have paid which my bank
electropolis

has confirmed to me and therewith this affair is settled
for me

  in exhaustion the lord fell back again into his chair
and my uncle also sat down fortunately uncle had
switched off the device which rolled back the chair as
soon as the guest arose it would have been somewhat
damaging to the dignity of the prime minister to have
sat down on the floor which he certainly would have
done if the chair had disappeared in the interim

  while the lord was seeking for ideas my uncle also
was silent he took from his desk a box of genuine
havana cigars and offered it to the lord

  i think it is purposeless for us to get excited you
know that i am right you are much too clever and
straightforward a man not to feel it yourself i under-
stand perfectly the australian government is dissatis-
fied with you the affair was all right when your rep-
resentatives were convinced that i was the loser

  i imagine that at that time they gave extraordinary
praise to yourself and your cleverness now things are
unfortunately different i mean unfortunately with re-
spect to you now it has turned out that i was the
cleverer one and now it is up to you to straighten mat-
ters out again

  you are to do this by any means any at all by
dishonest means if need be no lord albernoon you
are not the man for that all your life you have gone
straight ahead and this trip was very very hard for
you because you knew beforehand that i was in the
right to speak frankly i am sorry for you my lord



chapter xiv
banished

     lbernoon was about to start from his chair
     but uncle raised his hand

     you need not be offended you know that i
mean it honestly i will tell you something you shall
not have come to no purpose i will freely pay ten mil-
lions more which is i think no bad price for a trip
from canberra here besides i shall of course pay
for your plane which i destroyed

  the lord jumped up again which you-
certainly and in fact by an english invention by
the rindell-matthews rays which are at my disposal
here in any desired amount because of my great sub-
terranean power plant

  but why

  because i wanted to show you something about the
possibilities which i have prepared

  after walking up and down a few times nervously
the lord sat down again

i saw a plane crossing the sky and heard
uncle working the switches then the
plane slipped into a spin

wonder stories quarterly

 your lordship i think wa shall part good friends
 after all we have been talking a long time i have
 been most inhospitable you have travelled far and
 lunch time is past that is right it is being served
 now probably the bell will ring in a second

 he turned a switch and it became dark in the room
 then a strange humming commenced and i saw some-
 thing that made my hair stand

 we were separated from the part of the grotto which
 served as a dining room by a metal wall hung with
 tapestry now i could suddenly see through this wall
 it looked like a sort of gelatine

 i saw the dining room and the two servants in it in
 outline and then i saw through the next wall also into
 the engine room everything was transparent and in
 outline a remarkably reddish fluorescence filled the
 entire room while this was going on

 all this lasted only a moment then uncle switched
 on the light again and i saw that the two gentlemen had
 faces just as horrified as mine

 what was that

 the minister had his hands pressed to his temples
 he was evidently doubting his sanity my uncle smiled
 again

 nothing supernatural gentlemen absolutely nothing
 supernatural there is nothing supernatural in the
 world you will pardon me for having given you a
 little electrical exposition of your own to make up for
 your useless journey if first i had to show you the in-
 vention of one of your countrymen still what you just
 saw was the discovery of a german the gamma rays
 which certainly make it possible to look through almost
 all solid bodies

 my dear lord albernoon i really think you would
 do best to le friendly with mi i have all sorts of other
 little hidden things and powers-

 he stopped and said in another tone but now 
 may surely invite you to eat something

 i looked at the lord who showed that he was in no
 wise convinced that all these happenings were in accord
 with the laws of nature he pulled himself together
 and made a mighty effort to speak

 i regret that i think i have not the right to eat any-
 thing in this house

 uncle replied promptly that is too bad for the food
 is good

 then you refuse to give up your contract

 of course i refuse

 you will not take back your money

 i have no idea of doing so

 you are going to carry out your plans further

 i cannot imagine why else i should have conceived
 them

 you imagine that you can convert this desert into
 fertile land

 no

 you do not

 i do not imagine that i can i know it

 and what will be done with this land 

 it will make happy people of many immigrants
 immigrants coming from what country

 from germany of course and it will also export
 an extraordinary amount of wealth

 whither sir

 to germany if you do not object 

 man are you planning to found a sort of german
 colony in australia

 if you call it so

 i forbid you

 with what right

 in the name of parliament i banish you as an un-
 desirable alien as to whether i can render your con-
 tract null and void the courts will decide but you
 yourself i banish

then it is war

mttell

  you and your friends have three days to leave
 the country

 well

 did you understand me

 certainly

 and will you obey my order

 no

 and why not

 because on principle i obey no orders and moreover
 because here i am on my own territory your lord-
 ship please be so kind as to consider that i am the
 owner here and that i am extremely patient to let any-
 one address me thus

 then you refuse

 how often must i repeat it

 then i shall compel you

 uncle made up a very ironical face and smiled
 pleasantly

 would your lordship be kind enough to tell me how
 you will compel me 

 in case of need with my soldiers

 they are not here but in your cities

 i shall send them here a whole regiment if neces-
 sary

 you can do that you can even call upon the entire
 australian army

 will you perhaps resist them

 no

 very well then

 if i wanted to resist them they would first have to
 be here

 that will not take long

 not so

 sir you make me nervous

 it cannot happen at all

 why if i may ask

 i ventured to give your lordship a little demonstra-
 tion of the possibilities at my disposal

 i am sure that your lordship had a very good plane
 and probably you selected a very skilful flier when
 i thought it well to force you to land i merely turned
 a switch and sent out toward you those rays of which
 we were speaking previously your lordship were you
 not compelled to obey my command and when i wished
 did not your beautiful plane catch fire

 i have already told you that i am ready to pay for it
 that is a side-issue i now regard it as my duty to
 say to you leave your soldiers at home i am no
 advocate of bloody wars i do not like to kill people
 but i tell you this against my will no person and no
 plane will cross the border of the territory which i
 legally purchased from you i tell you this in all
 seriousness in case you disregard my warning i should
 be very sorry if through your fault-do you hear
 through your fault not through mine-australians
 whom i should be glad to regard as friends should
 lose their lives

 that is all nonsense

 perhaps then probably it was also nonsense that
 your plane fell that your pilot lost all control of it and
 that it finally burned up
electropolis



 the two gentlemen stood facing each other the
 lord said curtly and harshly then you want war
 no i want peace and justice

 we shall see farewell

 till we meet again your lordship till we meet
 again

 we shall never meet again

 he turned away and went accompanied by spencer
 through the automatically opening door the servant
 opened the door of the electric car and it went off
 uncle turned to me with a smile well my boy
 uncle you are the most powerful person on earth
 nonsense i simply know what i want and what i
 can do there was a time when these australian gentle-
 men thought they could treat us as they liked it will
 not hurt them to learn the contrary

 now he is your bitterest enemy he is gone
 uncle heinrich laughed loudly just wait here
 comes the epilogue of the play

 the whistle sounded as it did every time the car left
 or came back the door opened and the servant entered
 the room

 his lordship wishes to see mr schmidt

 with the greatest of pleasure come fritz

 we rode up and saw his lordship standing with a very
 red face by the sheet iron shack

 uncle greeted him politely but with a touch of irony
 was i not right in saying until we meet again
 the lord said angrily how am i to go away if i
 have neither a plane nor an auto 

 but your lordship left so positively and stormily
 that-

 the australian made an effort i could see how hard
 it was for him to say it i must ask you to lend me a
 conveyance

 with pleasure

 uncle worked some electric switches and in a few
 moments a brand new plane glided up

 may i request your lordship to accept this plane to
 take the place of the one burned

 i accept nothing of you have me taken to the
 frontier

 i am sorry but my pilot has no time you have
 yours the plane is your property

 the australian said no more got into the cabin along
 with his secretary the door was closed the pilot took his
 seat and the wheels ran over the sand the great bird
 rose into the air rapidly and uncle looked after it laugh-
 ing

 i think that of all that happened to him to-day the
 hardest thing was to have to ask me for the plane now
 come to dinner i think we can eat with better appetites
 than he i should not like to be in his shoes when he
 returns to canberra and has to report in parliament
 how things went with him here

the great secret

  

 it was evening by the time we had eaten the talk
 with the lord had lasted for hours we were again
 in uncles room

 will you allow me a question i said timidly
 speak

 i should not like to think you a magician

 nor am i one

 how was it possible for you to know beforehand
 every thought of the lord and every one of his objec-
 tions

 uncle was silent for a moment in thought and then
 he turned to me

  it is right i must tell you everything my boy
this is the greatest secret which i possess only you
shall know it because you are blood of my blood and
i love you but you must give me your word of honor
that you will keep this secret perhaps i shall request
of you to destroy it after my death and bury it for ever

  he spoke so seriously that i was embarrassed

  what frightful secret is this

  i understand how to read peoples thoughts

  uncle

  that is nothing remarkable it is merely a very
natural advance in already existing knowledge

  you know about radio you know that every sound
that the slightest movement by the sound of the softest
voice produces waves which are propagated in the air
and in the ether likewise every other activity produces
such waves naturally also the operation of thought by
the human brain

  extremely high electrical power such as i have at
my disposal through my machines such power as puts
at my disposal the gamma rays and the rindell-mat-
thews rayscan so amplify these tiny waves that they
vibrate an equally infinitely sensitive diaphragm

  to be sure it is necessary that the person whose
thoughts i wish to read and i along with my apparatus
be in very close contact therefore i have had shirts
made in the fabric of which are spun very fine wires of
a new metal and just such wires must be spun into the
suit if now the undershirt lies against the back and
the shirt and suit against the undershirt and the suit is
in contact with the back of the chair which contains in-
side it the apparatus with the necessary tubes and ap-
pliances while this chair is connected with my chair
by a wire while i wear on my body the same cloth-
ing which conducts the waves then those waves are
conducted to me

  you know that a person does not hear only with his
ears the auditory waves are also transmitted through
the bones so that a deaf person can under certain cir-
cumstances hear through his teeth and so it is suf-
ficient to have the diaphragm rest firmly against my
spine i am then able to hear these vibrations of the
other persons brain via my spinal cord just like the
spoken word

  it could be managed more simply by means of head-
phones but as i have these two chairs equipped i am in
a position to read the thoughts of any person sitting on
that chair without his perceiving it

  that is why i desire of each person who comes to
me to wear the linen and the suit which i have had put
out for him just as i did with you

  that is why i had to destroy the plane of the aus-
tralians and force them to use the auto in the heat that
was the only way i could make lord albernoon bathe
and put on the linen which was woven with those metal
wires

  he pressed my hand that is how i first guessed
your thoughts forgive me my boy it is an invasion
of human rights which i have found necessary to take
on myself i shall never use this for any other pur-
pose than to protect my work from destruction and to
take into my circle only such persons as have pure
thoughts

  it is a frightful weapon in the hands of mankind
and therefore i am not willing to bear the responsibility
for making it public although i am convinced that this
discovery will be made elsewhere sooner or later you
will give me your word of honor that you will tell no
one of it and you will not make me regret confiding in
	wonder stories quarterly

you something which i have never confided in anyone
else

  my word of honor uncle

  he pressed my hand firmly and we looked at each
other long and earnestly never in all these weeks was
i so convinced of the greatness and purity of this man
and never had i been so proud of his complete con-
fidence in me as in this hour for a long time we
sat there in silence i was reflecting what a dis-
covery that was what an incredible power silent
transference of human thought

  uncle then a time will come when anyone perhaps
will carry with him a little transmitter and a little re-
ceiver a time when any two people can communicate
together

  not any two only two persons whose wavelengths
are set for each other the others will apparently al-
ways be limited to such an apparatus as i have here to
a diaphragm and coils which equalize the wavelengths

  still what you say is true to-day without our
knowing or suspecting it is it not strange that thou-
sands of persons pass by one another without heeding
it and then suddenly two meet and feel that they belong
to each other  it may be man and woman or it may be
two friends who feel in perfect relation perhaps this
may be explained perhaps they are two persons who
from the first were tuned to the same wavelength

  it was a fine cool evening my uncle sat at his papers
but i lay up in the sand and thought over all the riddles
of humanity the solutions of which still lie in the
future

chapter xv
war

the war had begun that is to say we heard of
its preparations listening to australian news over
the radio in fact one of the engineers was now
on duty listening in continually

  the army was mobilized a whole fleet of airplanes
was called to duty we had our outpost planes every-
where in the air and our electric power plants of which
we now had four were at all times providing high
power current

  uncle was unhappy why are they doing that if
the people were reasonable they would see on the face
of things that it is impossible to conquer us why more
sacrifices of human life

  they believe that with a few squadrons of plane
they can so bomb our few settlements with shells and
poison gas that in a few hours all will be over

  they are mistaken nevertheless i do not like to
give orders to block the frontier everywhere with our
powerful rays that is a hazardous game too playing
such forces for we cannot fully guarantee the frightful
effects of them

  when i showed the australians the effect of the
gamma rays not as a game but as a warning example
even then i was aware of the danger the fact that
a tension of at least two hundred and fifty thousand
volts must be produced merely to obtain rays having a
wavelength of barely half a meter is astonishing

  to be sure this slight range has its good point it
makes it possible for us to erect a dividing wall in the
air before which and behind which there is no danger

  but our own machines we are like would-be magi-
cians working with weapons we hardly know and it
is possible that we shall ourselves be destroyed by them

  certainly much more dangerous rays shoot about in
space who knows-all the universe is nothing but a
struggle we strive to fly into space in rocket ships
seeking by all imaginable means to establish connections
with mars yet we do not even know whether it is in-
habited or has become a mass of eternal ice we cannot
see with our telescopes but-who knows whether the
inhabitants of other worlds have not other means
whether they are not striving for the earth as we for
the stars who knows whether the many rays which
are strange to us but fearful in their effect are not per-
haps a sort of bombardment from other planets i refer
to the millikan rays named after their discoverer which
infinitely surpass the gamma rays and penetrate through
two meters of lead with ease

  if these rays which shoot across the universe reached
our earth directly in a few seconds all life would be
destroyed by them but fortunately they are of such a
nature that they are at once lost as soon as they en-
counter a resistance even if no more than the atmos-
phere of the earth that is why we have only our little
wall in the air

  i was enroute with my uncle we crossed our ter-
ritory nine-tenths of it is still desert therefore we
put our protective wall about only that portion of our
land which was already under cultivation

  how slowly our work proceeds said uncle
why dont we cut great canals through the border
mountains and create a sea in the middle there was
formerly such an inland sea in australia

  uncle nodded there used to be but it is not merely
that the deposits of the rivers of that time raised up
the border mountains the interior also has risen it is
above sea level and cannot be flooded

  we were high up in a plane just uncle and i we
have an extremely delicate radio set on board and high-
power current in specially made storage batteries so
that we transmit messages with ease we also have keen
telescopes likewise a receiving set which brings us the
most minute vibrations

  we were justified in assuming that on this very day
the decisive step of the australians against us would
be carried out our protected territory is still so small
that although we cannot see all over it from this point
we can nevertheless hear over it with our electric radio
ears the enemy might do to the desert stretches just
what he liked

  we had agreed with our central station on a special
secret code a completely altered morse alphabet our
enemies are clever and we do not wish them to under-
stand our signals

  i heard sounds in my head phones uncle was man-
aging the transmitter we- floated almost motionless in
the still air like a huge eagle

  they are coming

  where

  from the south

  in the conversation that we had overheard the day
before they had spoken of an attack from the east that
had seemed strange to us why should they endanger
mt russell and the radium deposit besides that they
knew that we had a protective wall of rays there

  it was not long before i already could hear the noise
of the motors of the air fleet which was still hundreds
of kilometers away it is splendid to have so delicate
a microphone

  uncle nodded to me we shah go to meet them
we held our course straight to the south moving
along at a high speed
electropolis

the barrier

an hour had passed we were now perhaps half a
kilometer from our frontier protection we now
came closer very slowly approaching it within one hun-
dred meters and then we saw the hostile air fleet

  it was really a splendid sight they were bold and
enterprising men these australians they meant to
overwhelm us and finish matters at a single blow there
were at least one hundred and fifty planes speeding
along in squadron formation there were brave men
piloting those planes we had listened on the radio to
what the minister of war said to them they do not
underestimate our scientific power

  now our adversaries saw us they saw us and were
startled they were at any rate more startled by this
single plane than they would have been by an immense
fleet of planes for a moment the australians hesitated

   it was really a beautiful sight these hundred and fifty
perfectly uniform planes twenty-five to a squadron
headed toward us in the centre probably serving as
the military headquarters in this new type of battle
was a great dirigible they were all some eight hundred
meters in the air

  evidently an order was given for the planes set out
toward us for an instant i looked at uncle i must
admit that i felt somewhat uneasy but now i saw
uncle rise up his face a bit flushed his eyes shining
and a smile of contentment on his face

  it was not for nothing that uncle heinrich in all
these years had become half an american he was an
enthusiastic sportsman do they not look splendid
he said how fine they are with the sun shining on
their wings and their bright metal fuselages

  i marvelled at this and could not help thinking of
a story i had once read a man had been attacked by
a lion in the jungles of africa the lion stood over him
with his paw raised to strike the deadly blow from
its open mouth the saliva dripped on the mans face
although he was paralyzed by the fearful certainty of
death his only thought at the moment was what a
beautiful head the lion has

  but as uncle looked at the advancing planes there
was surely no fear of death in his mind we heard
the noise of the many motors and saw the six squadrons
shooting toward us at high speed there was still a
minute before they could reach us and then we would
surely be lost ridiculous as it may sound i involuntar-
ily clutched my revolver and then the miracle occurred

  no plane took fire but none reached us it was just
as though there were a glass wall between them and
us the planes stopped and hovered there we could
see clearly without using field glasses how the pilots
were working frantically at their controls but it did
them no good

  the controls no longer obeyed them the armatures
of their apparatus had become subject to our powerful
current the planes made a turn and although the pilots
worked like mad the six squadrons went back to the
dirigible broadside on uncle laughed so loudly that
it could be heard above the noise of the engines startling
me greatly his years in the bush and his life with
the savages had made a mark on him anyone who
did not know what was going on here would have
thought a man who stood up and laughed in a plane
eight hundred meters above the earth surely insane

  in the australian ranks a council of war was being
held then the fleet came back slowly in a single line
as yet they had not made out what was going on prob-

ably they imagined this uncanny power that so rudely
checked their victorious course came from our harmless
little plane they opened fire on us from a hundred
and fifty planes a storm of bullets came toward us in
quick succession with deafening crashes now i felt
like a soldier of the middle ages whom the devil has
made proof against his enemy the rain of shots seemed
to die away close before us on the invisible wall they
did not rebound but instead changed into a lively pyro-
technic display once the bullets entered the vicinity
of our fearful wall of rays they flamed up the drops
of molten metal turning to gas and burning

  yonder there was rage and indecision we almost
imagined we heard their words and saw their faces
trembling with wrath these men were no cowards
they were rash to the point of folly a single plane
came forward it sped along with all the power of its
motor straight ahead the pilot not touching the rudder

  the force of the impetus overcame the power of our
rays to turn the plane away i wondered whether the
current had failed for a moment the australian pilot
gave a cry of victoiy waved his hand to the others
and started to fire his machine gun then right before
us was a single brilliant flame

  in simply a second man and plane machine gun and
hand grenades all had vanished they had not fallen
they had simply melted been turned to gas and burned
up

   uncles face was now pale he shrugged his shoulders
angrily it is not my fault i warned them i did not
want to destroy a single human life they are fools if
they wil not listen

the bombardment

the bloodless battle lasted all day the hostile
squadrons climbed higher we followed them we
had everything with us even warm overcoats and oxy-
gen apparatus

  they climbed up and up already half fainting from
lack of air as they tried again and again to pierce our
wall in vain our wall seemed to reach up into the
very emptiness of space

  the fleet of planes finally turned and sped to the
south uncle nodded with satisfaction

  they have become reasonable at least they lost
only one plane and two men

  it was now evening and we were flying very low
here comes the sudden evening of the tropics directly
after the setting of the sun with no twilight to soften
the change we were enjoying a peculiar colossal dis-
play of fireworks the australian general was doing
his duty now that the fleet of planes had failed he
was trying to settle matters with his long distance guns

   it was pretty to see the heavy bombs and shells burst
on our wall of rays melting becoming gas and dying
a fiery death then there was another sight-misty
shadows which crept up as far as the rays and then
flashed up in bright flames

  those are poison gases it is a pity that many a
poor kangaroo will suffer from them

   i looked at him uncle is this the end of war for
the world

   perhaps but i do not believe so if only reasonable
and thoughtful persons were to use these rays as we do
for protection and defence yes woe to him who uses
these rays for attack in a few days he could destroy
the whole world and himself as well

  we had only one weak point this was allister city
on cambridge gulf i was surprised when in the middle
	wonder stories quarterly

of the night i returned to electropolis with uncle all
our zeppelins and planes were on the way to or from
there likewise all our chain-roads which led north
were dragging along countless cars all the camels and
elephants were en route and not far from electropolis
two hundred chinese were busily engaged in unloading
planes airships and cars they were piling up moun-
tains of goods

  what is going on here

  allister city is moving

  but why

  i am giving up the harbor it is too much exposed
i want to put the wall of rays a bit inland the sea
with its mighty surface of water diverges it recently
a ship going along caught fire the waves of the sea
conduct the rays too well besides the harbor is only
leased and why should i fight about it with the gentle-
men from canberra i do not need it

  you do not

  in the beginning i did but now we have our great
zeppelins where our wall of rays is to run i have set
up great transmitters to warn the ships but we must
act quickly

  i have just had word that the australian warships
are already on the way probably early tomorrow
allister city will be within the range of their guns let
them bombard it i do not care about a few sheet iron
shacks i cannot protect it either since wyndham city
lies on the same line and belongs to australia

  there was another battle the next day uncle and i
again went to be peaceful onlookers this time allister
and holborn went in two planes to the other frontiers
to observe matters there uncle and i flew to the north
and hovered behind the wall of rays which was now
cutting off our domain at a distancef of one hundred
kilometers from the coast

  the sun had risen and lay over the sea all was so
peaceful allister city had been abandoned looking
down i saw the bay where i spent the night -with
holborn and the little inlet where for the first time i
had seen the wonderful lung-fishes climb up into the
branches of the trees there where now there was
a green speck was the puddle in which the poor black
swan got its foot stuck in the mud

  there was a dull sound out at sea and the ground
was torn up among the sheet iron shacks an explod-
ing shell hurled quantities of sand and pieces of sheet
iron high in the air uncle nodded

  it is well that there are no persons there and nothing
of value to us we certainly must admit that they can
shoot the very first was a direct hit

  shell after shell struck the ground after half an
hour the entire city district looked like a heap of rub-
bish uncle smiled grimly

  that is one way to dig up the ground it works
almost better than our plows

the retreat

unfortunately a few direct hits were on
wyndham city the australians were killing their
own countrymen such a thing was almost inevitable
at that distance and uncle shook his head sadly three
hours had passed the bombardment had been over for
some time and the australian warships were cautiously
nearing the shore

  they seem to be wondering why we let them
bombard us without any resistance not even returning
their fire

  it was a stately fleet of great modern warships uncle
smiled

  if i wished i need only give an order they would
merely need to shift one lever over in electropolis and
all of these ships would be set afire i do not do so
for i am a man of peace and there is no need of it
boats came ashore at first there was only one after
a careful examination soldiers were sent out and cannon
brought ashore i wonder how these soldiers felt these
soldiers intoxicated with victory feeling that they had
just given us a severe defeat that they had now de-
stroyed our only seaport when they suddenly heard
above them in the air a loud warning voice go no
further a hundred paces to the south is certain death
look out for the electric wall

  we saw them stop-then we saw them laugh an
officer raised his hand he was giving commands
though we could not hear his voice he had seen our
plane and knew that the warning voice came from it

  we remained there quietly the officer was certainly
astounded at our madness in offering ourselves as a
target twenty machine guns flashed and two marine
cannon which had been brought on shore blazed it
was just the same as the day before the bullets became
little dots of fire and were harmless to us while we
calmly floated up there the soldiers stared at us the
sailors were of course superstitious as always

  there was a period of calm the men went back on
board the ships turned their broadsides to us a
mighty cannonade began the flaming cannon mouths
hurling their projectiles at us there was ten minutes
of frightful drumfire to us it meant nothing but a
gigantic display of fireworks then the firing ceased
signal flags went up everywhere and the ships with-
drew to the open sea

  uncle said they are still waiting for the attack
which never comes well it is over for awhile now
while we slowly flew back to electropolis night came
over us there was a bright full-moon and i could
plainly see my uncles face beside me it was perfectly
still all about us and we did not talk besides we were
too high up to hear the sounds of earth below us we
saw the long caravans of cars elephants and camels
still engaged in taking to desert city the materials they
had saved they looked like ants as they crawled along
apparently in silence over the great desert

  in this hour uncle seemed to me quite powerful more
powerful than ever before he was like a supernatural
being he held in his hand forces such as no inhabitant
of the earth had ever possessed in two days he repelled
the attack of a powerful nation firing not a shot himself
and purposely avoiding the destruction of a single life

           chapter xvi
           ominous quiet

uncle was planning a trip to san francisco i now
knew the significance of such trips which he made
frequently there was feverish activity in our chemical
laboratory in the past few weeks we had fetched
from the mine at mt russell immense amounts of
pitchblende and had obtained the radium from it

  transportation of the radium is managed in large
glass jars with an insulating fabric woven about them
the men wear clothes of that fabric while their faces
are covered by masks with windows for their eyes
they look much like the pest-doctors in the middle ages
uncle is careful one of the jars might get broken
electropolis	

as yet we do not know what rays might be released
and we want to protect everyone from injury

  we also hve a great metal keg in the mine which
can hold about two hundred pounds of the precious stuff

  uncle had a new side-cave blasted in the rock at the
central plant he intended to establish a cache there
for emergencies

  the australians appears to have ceased activities
after repeating their attacks for a week all was still
uncannily still each time uncle or mr allister went
away they came back with newspapers but there never
was the least word about us in them even our radio
receiving stations never reported any mention of us

  was uncles idea right did the australian govern-
ment see that it could not get at us was it therefore
ashamed and resolved to maintain a dignified silence
about us be that as it may we were going on with
our plans

  only this day we had commenced the cultivating of
the third district of a diameter of two kilometers now
besides our plows and sowers we had reaping and
threshing machines we also had some great store-
houses with central cooling to prevent early germina-
tion since we were already harvesting much more than
we needed	

  we even have a few immense meadow tracts of many
hundred kilometers also equipped with towers for arti-
ficial rain on the meadows were pastured hundreds
of sheep that savages brought us

  the great zeppelins had also brought us a number of
cattle of good stocks for breeding purposes raising
them of course is a slow business but we had the first
calves this year

  it is always a somewhat exciting day when zeppelins
or planes arrive here or leave the territory they fly very
high and at a fair distance from the coast they produce
an artificial mist about themselves in order not to be
seen that is no new invention it was tried out long
ago in the world war for us it has a special signifi-
cance if airships wish to enter or leave our territory
for the time being we must of course shut off part of
our electric protecting wall there is the danger that
australian fliers will try to come in at the same time

  part of our air fleet is always on duty watching the
unprotected place and carefully examining every enter-
ing airship those are the only occasions on which our
fliers are armed but they never yet used their weapons
it seems as though the australians had forgotten us
at any rate we never forget for a moment the needful
precautions and are always on our guard

  uncle was about to leave he had already left us
many times before but on this day i was uneasy i
looked at him searchingly he was not ill he was just
as sound and healthy as ever yet i was more anxious
than usual

  he assembled in the great hall of the casino-hotel all
the engineers holborn myself and allister who this
time was to go with him and remain abroad for a con-
siderable time uncle always had these assemblies be-
fore leaving he had to arrange his plans and name
a substitute for himself for the period of his absence

  formerly this substitute was always mr holborn of
whom i was very fond later when the technical de-
velopments became so great that the simple american
could no longer supervise them we all thought it natural
that chief engineer morawetz should take over the con-
trol during the absence of the chief

  now uncle was leaving for the first time since we
had been at war with australia there still was a war

even if complete quiet had prevailed for several weeks
since there had been no declaration of peace

a startling announcement

uncle made his announcement this time i shall
probably stay away a month

  chief engineer morawetz interrupted him you
know that you can leave us without fear mr schmidt
even now uncle has us call him mr schmidt
morawetz went on we all know our duties first
we will finish the fourth agricultural district i know
all your plans and you know that in me you have a
representative on whom you may rely absolutely in
every way

  uncle smiled at him i know my dear chief en-
gineer i know you perfectly i know every one of my
officials and i know just what to think of them

  i could not help being startled doubtless i erred
but it seemed to me as though morawetz looked taken
aback although my uncle smiled pleasantly

all this time i had been unable to overcome my aver-
sion for morawetz and his three friends now i re-
called as quick as lightning that the previous evening
uncle had had a long talk in his room with morawetz
and that the latter had sat during this time on the
chair which i had come to call the thought-chair
had uncle been reading his thoughts the night before 
my dear mr morawetz this time i must change
things during this trip i have determined to make
my nephew fritz my representative with full powers
i could feel myself blushing while morawetz grew
pale for a moment he lost his self-control and jumped
up have i deceived your confidence that you insult
me so it is-

  uncle had a still more friendly look not at all my
dear mr morawetz it is no msult it is simply my
wish that during my absence the new large high tension
plant at lady edith lagoon be completed and for that
you are indispensable i request you therefore to under-
take this new work with your proven industry which
i have always recognized that is much more important
than filling my place which my nephew will do mean-
time as my representative you see that do you not
my dear morawetz

  he held out his hand which morawetz took with
an expression more sour than sweet

  gentlemen you have heard my wishes and i request
you to work for my nephew during my absence just as
faithfully as you have for me you know that in spite
of his youth he is a good worker and that some day
if anything should befall me all this will belong to him
i therefore request you to remember that while i am
away he is your chief

  i was conscious that all were looking at me and i felt
embarrassed i was not only embarrassed but also per-
turbed uncle had never spoken so solemnly before
departing it almost sounded as though he feared he
would not return and was putting his house in order

              	 

  we were alone in uncles living room he was making
his last preparations for the journey i summed up all
my courage

  do you distrust morawetz

  he looked sharply at me you too

  morawetz stobitzer helding and kurzmiiller
  why

  i have noticed that they are inveterate gamblers and
often spend entire nights in the saloon of the camel
drivers

we looked intently at the wonderful sight the keg was rising faster
and shining more brightly
electropolis



  why did you never tell me

  i spoke to holborn about it and he laughed they
are otherwise good workers and you have confidence
in them i do not want to disturb you and i am averse
to accusing anyone i have not the slightest evidence
of any bad faith toward you and what they do with
their money is after all their own affair i just wanted
to keep on observing them in silence

  uncle looked searchingly at me for a while i think
that you have a keen eye for your years when i re-
turn i shall cancel my contracts with these four men
now i am still too much in need of them besides i
do not think they will do anything wrong at present
but it is well that you know them keep your eyes on
them but do not let it be noticed at any rate that we
have spoken about them

  i held out my hands to him thank you uncle for
your confidence in me i hope i shall prove worthy
of it

  he pressed my hand heres to a safe return

  i went with him to the plane which he himself was
to pilot full of anxiety i saw him off was there
not a gloomy foreboding in his last words

  then i myself went to the engine room and personally
saw to the shutting off of the electric current while uncle
left our territory i did not become until some time
later when i heard by radio from the ocean an hour
later that he had safely left the latitude of australia

the conspiracy

it was a month later i was hoping every moment
that uncle would return i really had no reason for
blaming myself in any way the work was going on
well i had been able to operate several new rain towers
the fourth agricultural district was completed every
evening i received news from morawetz by telephone
from lady edith lagoon and knew that the power sta-
tion there was close to completion

  mr holborn who made the daily rounds in my place
since i could not leave the central station where ques-
tions keep coming from all directions also brought
good news to me i had every reason to be content
yet i was not

  i was obeyed what i ordered was done yet i had
the feeling that there was always a certain mocking
smile on the lips of the engineers was it because i
am the youngest or was it simply because the ones
about me were those i distrusted-stobitzer helding
and kurzmiiller or was it just my imagination

  i felt like speaking about it to holborn but i did not
he was so very tired when he came back from the
flight he had aged greatly looking much older than
my uncle-and besides he would not have believed my
suspicions

  this afternoon something happened which had never
occurred before here we have a group of fifty chinese
laborers under the special command of stobitzer

  i never liked these people and i often had occasion
to scold them this afternoon it happened again and
i saw threatening glances and clenched fists did they
want to resist  for the first time i showed them a firm
will they yielded and said not a word as they sneaked
away still i know that they are inwardly hostile to me

	 

  it was night i was tired and my actual desire was
to sleep since the day had been hard for me yet i
felt uneasy was it because of the encounter with the
laborers did it come from the mocking smile on
stobitzers face

 i stepped once more from my house all was as still
 as death and i could see down the street to the saloon
 of the camel drivers this appeared to be perfectly
 dark but in the door stood the landlord it was jacques
 our former servant who from the first day had been
 much attached to me seeing me he put his finger to
 his lips and nodded his head to have me come nearer
 then he whispered i was just going to ret you
 what is it

 i do not know i understand people so poorly

 i went behind him through a dark passage i always
 carried a revolver and now i held it securely in my
 pocket the landlord led me into his living room which
 was dark and right behind the guest room

 i pressed close to the opening of a sliding window
 in the hall were stobitzer helding kurzmiiller and
 the fifty laborers they seemed about to break up a
 gathering and i could hear stobitzer speaking

 we must hurry are the three trucks coupled to-
 gether

 certainly

 are storage batteries in them

 yes

 we must get to mt russell during the night
 how do we get through the electric wall 

 that is our business we shall take the full keg
 and as much more as we can carry then quickly over
 the border early tomorrow an airship is expected and
 therefore the wall of rays must be opened at nine
 oclock at the same time we must get through the
 border

 you guarantee that there is no danger

 nonsense the junior chief is asleep

 and the pay

 as was agreed if we bring millions to the aus-
 tralians we can also demand millions

 then let us be quick about it

 they rushed to the exits i forced myself to be calm
 though i should have liked to rush out at them but
 that would have been senseless i could see by their
 greedy faces that they would simply have struck me
 down and then all would have been lost

 quick to the central station i said

 wait a minute until they are gone away there
 is no use in getting killed

 then i had an idea this evening morawetz had not
 telephoned from lady edith lagoon i questioned the
 landlord have you seen chief engineer morawetz
 certainly three hours ago

 did you see him here

 he came along with mr stobitzer and then went
 away

 which way

 toward the flying field

 now we were outside all was still and the three
 trucks had already left i ran as fast as i could to the
 central station

chapter xvii
mutiny

 i was completely out of breath when i reached the
 sheet iron house for the first time i was angered
 by our mechanical servants i pressed the lever to call
 the car and i knew that three minutes must pass before
 it arrived and two minutes more before it went down
 again with me it was of course foolish to be vexed
 even if it had been possible for me to lift the trapdoor
 and run down the steps no matter how fast i ran i


wonder stories quarterly

 would surely not have arrived sooner than the car would

 the whistle sounded the car came i jumped in on
 the way i counted the seconds before i should arrive
 at last i was in the great machine cave holborn had
 finished his evening rounds he was giving the switch-
 board another examination and was lighting a cigar
 when i rushed in so excited he looked at me in surprise
 what is it

  a conspiracy

 by whom

 the fifty chinese laborers-

  holborn shrugged his shoulders indifferently
  stobitzer helding and kurzmuller are in league
  with them by chance i overheard them settling mat-
  ters they are now en route to mt russell

 what do you mean by en route 

 they have coupled three trucks together

 holborn smiled grimly

  we can stop that for them

  he turned a lever

 now the road has no current

  they have storage batteries charged only yesterday
  do not take the matter too lightly the three engineers
  know what they are about i think the affair has been
  long planned

 what do they want to do

  i was in despair that the american could remain so
 calm

  simply to steal the radium

 again holborn shrugged his shoulders

  that would not be so terrible since we have still
  more of it you know as well as i do that it is impos-
  sible to get through the circuit of the rindell-matthews
  rays which surround the mountain with a safe wall i
  do not think that the engineers are so silly as to try
  if they do i am sorry for them but i suppose they
  have a right to run to their own destruction

  but what if the rays are shut off

 impossible it simply cannot be done there is
 nobody at the machine which works automatically do
 you think that the machine can be bribed or perhaps be
 influenced by a friendly shout

  you know perfectly well that there is only one pos-
  sibility of shutting off the machine he said in re-
  proval the subterranean wire which runs to the soda
  spring but nobody knows of the concealed little cave
  in which the wire lies and even if they did find the
  cave they would surely not discover the switch which
  lies under the prickly pears

 chief engineer morawetz knows it

 morawetz is as faithful as you and i besides he
 is not here tonight he is busy at carnegie lake about
 a thousand kilometers south of here installing the new
 plant

 the landlord jacques saw chief engineer morawetz
 this evening about three hours ago he was down in
 the city

  holborn paled

  we shall find out about that at once

 we went into the other room there holborn got
 central

 carnegie lake emergency

 all right there was a pause while the operator
 got the connection

 i want to speak with chief engineer morawetz

  i had taken the second receiver and could follow the
  conversation

 chief engineer morawetz has not been here for

 three days engineer weber is taking his place would
 you like to speak with him

 no thank you

 for the first time holborn was becoming uneasy
 morawetz left his post without telling us
 morawetz is stobitzers best friend

 where was morawetz

 down in the city near the flying field

 holborn asked for a connection with the flying field
 was chief engineer morawetz there

 he left the flying field two hours ago in plane 
 piloting it himself

 where was he going

 to carnegie lake

 holborn hung up

 i am convinced that he went to mt russell i said
 earnestly

 man you are making me terribly uneasy holborn
 said nervously

 again he telephoned the flying field

 get a fast plane ready at once and bring it to the
 central station

 we walked up and down in excitement then hol-
 born rushed again to the telephone

 lady edith lagoon post

 well

 immediate information when you sight a plane
 just saw plane  pass

 which way

 toward mt russell holborn slammed down the
 phone

 damn it you are right

the catastrophe

 the whistle announced the car we found the plane
 up above for a moment we hesitated

 a strange thing for the first time i doubt whether
 i can leave the power plant alone a mutiny among
 us incredible what if they should destroy the power
 plant

 shall i stay here i asked

 i should like to take you along i dont want to
 bear all the responsibility

 i do not believe there is any danger threatening the
 power plant i commented the people are crazy for
 the radium i believe that at this moment they are
 thinking of nothing else

 holborn busied himself with the levels he discon-
 nected some circuits and made other connections

 they will not get in easily i changed the wires
 now it is impossible to call the car and whoever touches
 the switch will be electrocuted i hope the chief does
 not come in our absence

 we must warn him

 that is impossible we must risk things as they
 are if he comes he will see that the switch is changed

	 

 we sped through the night the fast plane made
 more than three hundred kilometers an hour although
 the wind was against us in silence we sat side by side
 but we could hardly have spoken anyway the motor
 made so much noise holborn was at the controls

 it was midnight we saw mt russell before us
 silhouetted against the night sky there was the re-
 markable sugarloaf seemingly perched on the rounded
 lower part which looked like a brick-kiln at the foot
 of the mountain we saw lights-not torches or burning
 fagots such as the natives have-but electric lights
 people were running up and down with them we saw
electropolis	

a snaky line of such electric lamps climbing up the slope

  we glided down quickly holborn for once was
full of excitement

  now it must be decided now they are very close
to the wall of rays if they-

  he did not finish the sentence a frightful crash
resounded suddenly the rocky cone seemed to have
become a volcano sparks and flames jets of flame
many meters long shot out from the mountain in all
directions our plane cracked and split in all its joints
and was forced down to earth we lay under it and
involuntarily covered our faces with our hands all
hell seemed to have broken loose

  it was just as though we were in the centre of a fear-
ful bombardment at the same time an earthquake
seemed shaking the ground beneath us while a thunder-
storm filled the air

  i struggled to my feet my limbs ached and i felt
that my whole body had been showered by red-hot grains
of sand holborn was sitting near me his eyes full
of horror

  the moon was bright and full i could see that my
companion was almost naked and that his face his arms
and his chest were dotted with countless little black dots
holborn seized my hand

  mt russell has vanished

  not until now had i sufficiently collected my wits to
know clearly where we were i managed to look in the
direction of the mountain holborn was right to be
sure the broad lower part of the mountain still seemed
to be there but the pointed cone had completely dis-
appeared

  how can that be

  the immense transformer station was built into the
base of the cone that conducted the current for die
production of the rindell-matthews rays from the wire
from the central plant to the apparatus

  i know but what then

  morawetz wanted to shut off the current and the
whole plant exploded

  holborn said this in the energetic tone of a person
who asserts what he does not believe

  i slowly managed to step over to him

  how can a machine explode how can such an
explosion occur that the whole mountain breaks up and
flies into the air in a thousand pieces

  holborn nodded quite incredible there is only
one explanation

  what

  we have simply been children who were pleased
with the first thing they found perhaps it was just
as well for us we have done nothing and investigated
nothing we have been contented and happy with the
old mine and have taken out radium by the bucketful
which our cleverer forerunners of ten thousand years
ago left behind for us we never reflected as to what
that upper cone-may have contained

  perhaps by chance the whole giant meteor lay on
the crater of a volcano i ventured and the disturb-
ance now caused the eruption of the volcano

the strange sight

holborn shook his head in the interior of
australia there are no volcanoes the only ones
near here surround the continent in a wide belt of little
islands probably this whole strange cone was filled
with gas or some extremely powerful explosive per-
haps as yet unknown to us

   then perhaps we have lost a great discovery

  a discovery which can only do harm is no great
loss holborn said contentiously it probably hap-
pened that when morawetz who had never tended this
machine tried to shut off the powerful current by the
switch at the soda spring great sparks jumped inside
near the apparatus it is conceivable that the earth-
quakes which we have felt in the last few days made
rifts in the mountain

   if there really was a gigandc hollow space filled with
gases and explosives then it is conceivable that the
grotto where the machine was also was filled with these
gases and that the spark ignited them

  the mountain certainly was filled with gases and
explosives i replied in a tone of convicdon the jets
of flame spurted out on all sides

  holborn seized my hands again he showed his
warm heart

  do you know the single true marvel which happened
tonight

  i understood him and nodded that hleaven gave
both of us our lives

  holborn smiled a bit sadly the good plane was
true to the last we owe our lives to its great elastic
wings alone that withstood so well the air pressure it
was chance that the rain of rocks spared us

  but the others

   let us not think of them they have made a fearful
atonement it is absolutely impossible that one of them
should be alive look where the lights were gleaming
the crumbled fragments of the mountain have now
formed a new hill there

  slowly we climbed this hill the form of the lower
part of the mountain was also completely changed the
forest was covered with rubbish and tree-tops covered
with grey dust towered up sadly from the debris

  now we stood where one entered the little garden
the wonderful garden which had bloomed so marvelous-
ly under the influence of the radium a miracle had
happened here too perhaps the garden owed its safety
to the fact that it stood too close to the cone and that
the latter was blown up and over it the garden was
uninjured and its splendid flowers bloomed in their
former glory

   where the soda spring had been there was now a deep
hole like a shell hole and the spring had disappeared
the mountain itself now formed a sort of crater

   mr holborn it is a volcano dont you see in that
depression which probably hides the true crater the
reddish light

  we will go back

  we hurried a few steps and then we stood still as
though enchanted what use to flee why flee with
our weak feet if the mountain was really to hurl out fire
nd lava but it was not so it was a perfectly super-
natural sight at which we were staring overcome by its
strangeness

   in the centre above the now level top of the moun-
tain completely surrounded by a magic reddish light
floated a great cylindrical object with one of its some-
what pointed ends turned upward

  now i grasped holboms hand that is the great
metal keg in which we packed two hundred pounds of
radium to carry it to the central plant it will explode
holborn denied this his voice having the tone of a
person carrying out a most sacred duty radium does
not explode

  i wondered why i whispered when i replied how
is it possible for die heavy metal body with the radium
illustration by paul

inside it to float no it is not floating it i rising
faster and faster into the air

holborn was carried away by the sight in its sur-
rounding reddish shimmer does it not look like the
holy grail

chapter xviii

the return of schmidt

we looked intently at the wonderful sight the
meteor which we had actually made was rising
faster and shining more brightly then we saw
a flame leap high in the air and heard a hissing noise as

 though the thought was preposterous i had an intuition
 that made me convinced

we ran as fast as we could we found a heap of
twisted smoking ruins the cabin had split apart at
the crash and it was filled with flames

where is uncle

 holborn cried out here he is

at least twenty paces from the plane we saw the
body of my uncle the cabin had been burst open in
the crash perhaps even up in the air at any rate
uncle had been hurled out and had fallen into an in-
credibly dense growth of ferns which had somewhat
broken the fall

t-x

though some body which we could not recognize in the
speed of its fall rushed through the air and plunged
into the blooming garden not far from us

  at first we supposed that the meteor had burst but
on looking up again ve saw it going far up above us
in its course like a little glowing dot now we ran
into the garden holborn cried out a plane a plane
that has crashed

  i stood rigid my knees trembling is it uncle

 we knelt beside him holborn torn open his shirt and
 laid his hand on his heart he is alive 

 his face which was buried in the ferns was bloody
 yet waxy i trembled with anxiety for him and the
 american cautiously tried to investigate his wounds

 he stood up and looked earnestly at me now we
 need a good doctor

 have you discovered anything

 his limbs do not seem broken and i do not think

again he bent very close to the
wound-this savage with infinite
skill  then the brain began to pulse
electropolis



there are any internal injuries he breathes very calm-
ly now and he has no foam on his lips but i would
rather he had broken his arms and legs

  what has happened

  i could set broken legs in case of need but i think
a piece of iron which is lying nearby has fractured his
skull

  he will die

  holborn straightened up and glared at me no
weakness now no hesitation 

  what can we do take him to the central station
how we have neither a plane nor a car nor any
doctor either

  he reflected further there is only one way only
one resource truly it seems an extraordinary chance
he ran from me up the hill he put both hands to
his mouth and gave three times in succession a long-
drawn cry it was the same cry which my uncle had
used in calling for mormora the chief of the cannibals

  all remained still holborn repeated the cry even
more loudly and then i could have shouted for joy in
spite of my anguish for an answer came from the dis-
tance i did not know what holborn intended but i
had heard much about the healing powers of the savages
though i did not understand i clung to every hope

  uncle began to draw deep slow breaths his face
took on a bit of color and then became red as though
he were in a fever i could only kneel by him and i
was not ashamed that the tears came to my eyes how
sunken his face was this face full of a thousand
wrinkles bespeaking years of denial how weak and
helpless he lay there only a being who moved softly
instead of the great energetic courageous man he had
been

  i heard voices beside me three men stepped up
holborn and two savages as yet i had come into but
little contact with them they lived a shy existence in
the woods i merely knew that they were still cannibals
though secretly and furtively

  the two savages were almost naked their bodies
were extensively tattooed and colored strangely-shaped
scars which they had produced artificially accompanied
their wild ornaments each of them the old one as well
as the young man had a wild shock of hair dyed red
and stuck full of all possible bright feathers in their
hands were bows and arrows i knew that the points
were dipped in the deadly poison which they got from
the roots of the bamboo

  while the younger stood still with an impassive face
the old man knelt down beside my uncle felt of his
head and then spoke to holborn i understood nothing
of it but two words struck me agala and tena
ingeit i knew that the former word meant lord
and therefore meant my uncle and that the latter word
was the name of the conjurer of the tribe

  at once the two savages sped away in great bounds
  you mean to-

  holborn nodded we must have a good doctor
every minute is precious since we cannot conjure up
a white doctor we must rely on the magician

  we stepped aside a bit

  i was right the skull is fractured probably splinters
have entered the brain if anything can save him it is
au immediate trepanning of the skull and the careful
removal of all foreign bodies before festering and a
fever from the wound set in

  you think they can do this

  i hope so

  only a few minutes passedbefore the chief returned

  with a whole swarm of men and women with their
remarkably sharp stone knives and axes they at once
started to fell young bamboo shoots in the garden and
to build a little hut others equally quickly wove a
sort of litter and covered it with fern

  uncle groaned

  shall we not at least put a cold compress on his
head

  holborn said no we will now leave everything to
the conjurer

an operation in the wilderness

suddenly the latter stood before us he looked
very differently than when i had first seen him
now he was neither painted nor anointed on the con-
trary he was washed very clean and was stark naked
except for a loin cloth in his hand he had a little
package done up in green leaves this he laid on the
ground

  the man had a very serious face he was tall and
elderly afe he now knelt beside uncle and carefully
touched the injured head with incredibly gentle fingers
it seemed as though i were watching a european special-
ist making a diagnosis

  he beckoned to two young savages equally well
washed who seemed to be his assistants while tena
ingeit himself held the head of my uncle they carried
him to the litter which had been prepared and laid him
down the conjurer called out a few words and now
the assistants brought a number of opened cocoanuts
which were full of liquid but had not commenced to
sprout

  with this liquid all three now very carefully washed
their hands i could not help asking holborn why
doesnt he use water

  instead of holborn the chief replied in broken
english the wound shall not weep pus

  holborn whispered to me it must not fester prob-
ably the liquid has an antiseptic effect at any rate i
have never seen wounds which were treated with this
cocoanut juice suppurate

  meanwhile the conjurer had opened his package
there was nothing in it but a few very sharp splinters
of flint a few shells polished to a sharp edge and some
fishbones certainly they were very few implements
but he also washed these very carefully with the juice
of some other cocoanuts

  i was amazed to see how infinitely clean this ordinari-
ly dirty person could be and how thoughtfully and def-
initely he made every move first he made with the
flint knife a sharp cut right across the wound then
with two fishbones which he used as pincers he care-
fully lifted out the shattered bits of bone while the in-
valid groaned heavily

  the brain does not pulse bits of bone must have
been driven in

  then-is it all over

  be quiet and wait

  i saw a quick reproachful glance from the conjurer
to me what clever eyes the man had

  again he bent very close to the wound and i shud-
dered to see this savage with infinite skill in the act
of picking out a number of splinters without even
touching the brain with his hand then-the brain
began to-pulse very gently

 he now took the central leaf of a bunch of banana
 leaves washed this also in a new cocoanut warmed it
 over a hot fire and pressed it over the wound then
 he very skilfully drew the skin and tissues over it
	wonder stories quarterly

 again washed them also with a fresh cocoanut and then
 fastened the head up with all sorts of vegetable fibres
 which his assistants handed him

   for a moment the conjurer waited after he had laid
 my uncles head back on a cushion of cool ferns i
 myself was full of wonder uncles face again had its
 normal color he slept peacefully he did not seem
 feverish since his skin was not hot and his pulse was
 strong and regular

   i could not restrain myself i stepped up to the con-
 jurer seized his hands and pressed them he looked at
 me in amazement at this expression of friendship which
 was strange to him then he looked at uncle and back
 at me probably he thought i was uncles son he
 slapped me cordially on the shoulder stroked my hair
 smiled at me and went away with his assistants

  the other savages had also withdrawn after the
women had brought us some roast meat and fruit i
said to the american do you really think that he will
recover

   i certainly hope so

  then he sat down and took out his pocket-knife

   we will eat for we must keep up our strength

   he saw the rather close look which i gave the meat

   no no that is kangaroo

  are they really cannibals i asked looking up

   certainly others could not perform such an opera-
 tion perhaps it is just their cannibalism which makes
 them so conversant with human anatomy

   that is terrible yet there was something kind and
 intelligent in that fellows eyes

  holborn nodded it is a remarkable fact which
has been observed in new pomerania new mecklen-
burg and also in bougainville island that the cannibals
are mostly more intelligent than the non-cannibals

   i shook my head in surprise

   we must get a clear idea about it it certainly is
 terrible but cannibalism almost always is due to strange
 religious views it is not practiced because of a fond-
 ness for this meat sometimes it is sacrifices made to
 the gods as for instance the old aztecs in mexico
 thought to partake of the deity in the form of a hand-
 some youth or else they believe that if they eat a
 dead enemy who was mighty in life his power will
 pass over to them there are many things which are
 hard to understand and easy to condemn

alone i

we ate in silence uncle lay very still with closed
eyes apparently sleeping peacefully

   after weaving a sort of sunshade over uncles litter
 using shady branches we climbed right up the mountain
 to see the extent of the damage the old mine had dis-
 appeared

   there was a crater in semicircular form leading down
 to the lower end of the shaft almost everywhere we
 saw smooth rock but here and there some pitchblende
 was still in sight we at once recognized it by its greasy
 lustre

  holborn nodded there are still several hundred
pounds of it and we can get out a few millions worth
of radium in truth we must be quick about it be-
cause if once the plants of the primeval forest take pos-
session of this ground all is lost

   i feel faint

   holborn pulled me up i saw that he too was totter-
 in-

   we have no insulating garments

  with our machetes we cut off a number of prickly
pears and threw them down we knew that there was
no plant which grew more rapidly and kept others from
growing we also knew that prickly pears were easier
to remove than the roots of trees

  it was evening we had watched all day beside
uncles litter he had not opened his eyes but he was
breathing calmly now that it was cool and the sun
had set the savages came back we had said nothing
to them but they knew we needed them tena ingeit
had not come with them he seemed sure of success
without saying much the savages took up uncles litter
and began to walk slowly down the valley i went be-
side them with holborn

  one of us must get as quickly as possible to the
nearest plant we must have a plane here and one of
us must get to the central plant to see that everything
is all right there you are younger than i do you
want to go

  if you think it best

  it was two nights later in spite of the heat i had
traveled all day but luckily through the bush not
through the desert then i came upon one of the cars
on which the mutineers had ridden up to the mountain
it had rolled back by itself and chance had lodged a
stone in front of the wheels perhaps it was a stone
from the splintered mountain i was able to remove
this brake and now the car went back with me quickly
thus i saved many kilometers of walking until i came
to level ground again

  then came another night march i held my revolver
in my hand snakes crossed my path birds screamed up
in the trees kangaroos whisked about in the distance
and occasionally the laughing jackass guffawed above
me

  when the sun rose for the second time i had reached
our post at lady edith lagoon the guard had indeed
seen the glow in the sky but otherwise he knew nothing
i telephoned to the central station in electropolis en-
gineer zollner was there and he was amazed that none
of us was at the central plant i merely told him for
the moment that he should at once send two fast planes

  the two planes arrived one i at once sent on tell-
ing the pilot that he must fly low and keep a lookout
for the sick party i said that uncle was slightly hurt
and needed the plane with the other i myself flew
back to electropolis

  engineer zollner was waiting for me he had
noticed that the switch at the sheet iron house was al-
tered he had not touched it together we replaced
things as before nothing had happened in the city
the few inhabitants were caim and i saw from zollners
manner that the other eight engineers knew nothing
about the mutiny of the four who had atoned for it
with their lives

  i went through the empty caves through my uncles
room the doors opened and shut automatically before
and after me the lights went along the wall as usual
and accompanied me to the engine room here all was
as before the wheels hummed and roared the pulleys
whizzed regularly through the air the oil dripped into
the joints and the turbines roared and churned the
water all was as usual except that i was alone i
had not seen the servants and zollner had remained
above ground and had returned to the city uncle was
ill perhaps already dead-

  before me were those gigantic machines which did
not need me stretching out their iron arms and bending
like living beings to-the right and left singing their low-
electropolis	

pitched song-the song of the machine the song of the
iron man

  i stared at them and thought i understood how the
man of whom my uncle had told me had become mad
when he was alone with these iron men

chapter xix

uncertain days

was alone for almost eight weeks carrying on the
whole work myself but my thoughts were constantly
with my uncle he did not come back by plane
tena ingeit the conjurer and medicine man the can-
nibal opposed this he wanted uncle carried by the
savages to the central station i saw that he was right
and much wiser than i uncle was ill very ill

  even if the operation succeeded he had a very bad
wound and the least shock would have killed him to
be sure the plane trip would have lasted only an hour
and then he would have been at home but he could
easily have been shaken up by this trip even the vibra-
tion of the propeller would have shaken his body and
the rising and descending would have altered the flow
of blood to the brain

  tena ingeit was right and i could see that we our-
selves were not so very wise uncle was carried of
course only at night while in the daytime the savages
put up a new leaf hut each morning so that he would
have shade their women carried along all the material
for these huts

  i knew all this because a plane always went with them
and returned to me it carried ice from our refrigera-
tion plant also food and drink

  it is all so strange to me i feel calmer because this
savage tribe is accompanying and watching over my
uncle for i acquired more confidence in these cannibals
than in our own people our own people wanted to
rob us and caused the whole disaster they were re-
sponsible for the accident that befell uncle

  but it is good training for me to be alone -i feel
that i have learned very much i have not only learned
to discharge the tasks set me but also to act inde-
pendently i sit at the desk where uncle used to sit
i know exactly what is to be done and give by telegraph
the orders which i believe my uncle would have given
our territory is very great in most parts nothing is
known of uncles mishap the ground glass screen
keeps lighting up dispatches appear on it and i give
the answers i decide as i think best it would be
vain to put things off for weeks will pass before uncle
is well again unfortunately mr allister is away for
a long time

  i have commenced an investigation the four other
engineers who are in the vicinity i have summoned to
come by plane and now i know that all of these men
did not like morawetz and his three friends i realize
now that they suspected more than i

  we broke into the houses of the four criminals and
searched their possessions of course they were more
guilty than the laborers morawetz was the soul of
the whole affair

  i shuddered when i thought it all over it was well
that uncle had gone away they wanted to kill him
morawetz was either frivolous or else very sure of his
business he had not even burned his papers i found
letters from canberra they were written by mr
spencer lord albemoons secretary the lord him-
self apparently did not want his name used since
giving op the war they were trying to down uncle in

this way they offered morawetz an immense sum if
lie would deliver to them the contents of the mountain
and first of all that of the great keg-that great keg
which ultimately flew out into the ether as a meteor

  it seemed to me best to hide all this from uncle he
should believe it an accident until he got well again i
was startled by my own thoughts i was calculating on
his recovery as though it were certain and yet-

  at last the morning came when the savages reached
electropolis

  it looked as though they were carrying a corpse our
chinese stood on both sides of the street as they came
by first came the chieftain in full warpaint holding
spear bow and arrows as though he had to protect
uncle then came the litter on which the invalid lay
behind it walked together like two old friends old
holborn and tena ingeit the latter now adorned in all
his finery as a conjurer the entire tribe followed in a
procession

  we brought uncle down into the cave and put him on
his bed he looked very pale and his eyes were closed
i stood in the next room with holborn and tena in-
geit the conjurer emptied a brownish liquid from a
gourd into a glass uncle was to drink this on awaking
we were by now accustomed to regard the conjurer as
a physician but he pleased me better when he was naked
and only a simple person than when he was adorned in
his finery

  holborn looked much aged and worried he pressed
my hand

  if only his heart holds out

  i sat on the edge of the bed uncles eyes were open
and he spoke-his voice very soft but perfectly clear
he was asking about the work

  i was very happy he had no fever and was per-
fectly rational he looked at me with such kind af-
fectionate eyes

looking backward

to-day was a sad day it is four years since i
arrived in electropolis four years and what
years they were i still thought of the day when i first
landed in the plane and saw the desolate place-the lone-
ly shack of sheet iron-when i went with beating heart
for the first time down into the cavern to meet my
uncle	-

  i thought of the day when the village of the gold-
miners burned that was really the initial cause of
this gloomy day i thought of the hour when lord
albernoon brought us the agreement then there was
the day of triumph when he was again with us and
when for the first time the rain clouds were produced
over our four towers and later when the first green
growth lay over the first cornfields and i thought of
the day when the same lord albernoon declared war
on us and wanted to exile us

  i stood on the high tower the tallest of our radio
towers which had now been erected at the central sta-
tion and looked off i had a telescope and i could
see quite far now there were already six such great
circles each two kilometers in diameter under cultiva-
tion in each was a platform from which the machines
were directed we had given up the idea of a clock-
work there was already a beautiful forest of eucalyptus
about electropolis we had bananas corn and barley
to eat raised by ourselves growing out where there
was formerly a stony desert

  we had new and mighty plans we had seen that
since we produced rain and since we had the ether rays


wonder stories quarterly

more and more in our power even the climate had
changed we no longer needed to submit entirely to
the will of our machines

  uncles restless mind had thought out new plans
we would build cities these would be industrial cities
lying between the cultivated circles and using the land
between them these would be cities with houses hav-
ing not central heating as at home but central cooling
groves of palms would grow about them white men
would live and work in these cities

  since losing the port and cambridge gulf we had
been limiting ourselves to our planes and zeppelins
we had built no railways in quick succession the whole
country so far as it was under cultivation has been
spanned by a close network of airplane routes we have
also opened the iron works at lady edith lagoon and
we do not miss the coal we get electrical energy from
the great stony stretches of the deserts which the suns
rays strike and besides we have now bored down to
five subterranean rivers which give us water power

  our planes go in rapid succession during the day
we send ships with cooling apparatus during the night
the ships for passengers we have no pilots for them
all are controlled from the central station by the same
system which we used when we were testing the first
wall of rays at mt russell

  our ships go very high when they are to go overseas
when they leave our territory the ray wall is broken
just for a few minutes which makes it impossible for
any outsider to reach our land

  in canberra they ignore us they broadcast a yarn
telling the world that strange air currents make it im-
possible to fly over the interior since the australian
government does not allow any other nation to make
investigations the world believes it in fact has to be-
lieve it

  i had had a long talk with ujicle heinrich before he
went on his last journey he is now sixty-six years old
by his seventieth birthday we had hoped to have every-
thing under cultivation then all our colored laborers
the africans and chinese were to be sent away again
for we should no longer need them only white men
were to come here to live to enjoy the fruits of the great
works to live and work in the industrial cities to in-
vestigate further in our laboratories the various rays
and to eat what the newly created gardens produced

  it was eight weeks ago that uncle mentioned these
things with eyes shining with youth in his step eight
weeks now he was lying weakly on his couch i
knew that he must die i had known for an hour since
the physician whom we got from san francisco ex-
amined him

  tena ingeit had performed the operation splendidly
but uncles heart was exhausted this human heart which
unfortunately is no iron machine with replaceable parts

  uncle was to die probably this very night i could
have cried it out to all this vast work of his he was
to die-and what then

  a signal flashed below i had arranged with hol-
bom to send for me when uncle awoke i cast one
more glance about a plane was just leaving the air-
port and heading north it was the physician he was
leaving because his skill was useless

the passing of the master

i was down in the cave for in the same cave in
which he began his work the lion wanted to die
he scorned going to one of the new houses that make
up the electropolis of to-day

  holborn nodded to me in the last few days he had
become an old man he seemed shriveled up he was
a fearful sight and i had to fight back my tears i was
not ashamed but it was heartrending to see this old man
weep this man who spent a generation in the wilderness
and who is nothing but an embodied iron will

  he wants to speak to you

  uncle was lying in the great armchair hje did not
want to be in bed for his weak heart was more com-
fortable when he was sitting i would hardly have
known him if i had not gone through the last fewdays
with him tena ingeit was unable to save him yet it is
the savage perhaps to whom the entire work owes its
future he made uncles mind clear

  uncle looked at me a long time in silence suddenly
i remembered uncle was sitting in the old chair with
me opposite him-i knew the apparatus was working-
for the last time uncle was reading my thoughts well
let him read them-they were nothing but sorrow for
him

  get up and sit here on the stool no do not weep
we are only men after all the hour comes for each
of us some time heaven meant well with me better
far better than with wenzel aporius whom it smote
with madness

  again he paused his head sank forward a little
holborn stepped up to him he smiled andsaid not
yet-i feel- not yet

  he straightened up again i dictated my last will
to holborn i have signed it the witnesses were hol-
born and the foreign doctor who can do no more than
tena ingeit who told me yesterday that my heart was
no longer good for anything take the will to your
room read it carefully and then return it to me

  he saw me hesitate and smiled sorrowfully go
calmly i have time for that i beg you go

  i sat in the old cavern the one which had been my
first dwelling when i came to electropolis and read
it was not easy - mr holborn wrote it and his clumsy
hand is not accustomed to using the pen

  i am about to die i know it i should have pre-
ferred living longer but i am grateful to fate to you
my dear fritz i leave all that i possess you were my
nephew when i summoned you here and now you are
my son i long ago registered your adoption in the court
at san francisco i thank you fritz i have not been
disappointed in you now be a man in this hour read
what i propose and i will ask the great destiny that
rules mankind to let me live until i know your decision

  the work is ready the machines are where we
need them in the last few years i have taken a great
deal of radium out of the mountain and sold it myself
in san francisco i guessed that something would
happen like what did occur at mt russell in the bank
of san francisco i have on deposit one hundred million
pounds

  this money belongs to you as well as this land if
you will continue my work and fulfill my conditions

  my work belongs to germany only germans are
to enjoy its fruits but only men who wish welfare and
peace for these treasures are not to be used for the
purposes of war and its machines are never to become
machines of war

  will you accept my heritage i entrust it to you
call your friends to help you but let everything be a
riddle and a mystery until everything is completed and
new germany is a power if you will not if you want
to go back among mankind then take a million pounds
and go and do what you please
electropolis	

   it took me a long time to read all of it i could not
 restrain my tears when i saw that holborn had been
 crying as his stiff fingers made the letters

  i returned to uncle he was asleep holborn was
 sitting beside him feeling his pulse he beckoned to
 me

  he is getting weaker and weaker

  did uncle hear him  he straightened up and looked
 at me again his mighty energy controlled his weaken-
 ing body

   well

   i was going to sit in the big chair so that he could
 read my thoughts again but he did not wish it

  no longer-look me in the eye

   i thank you uncle i could hardly speak

  what for

   i swear to you by all that is sacred to me that my
 entire life belongs to your work

  my son

  i knelt before him his hand rested on my head
 with his other hand he took holboms for a long
 time we were silent then i felt a slight twitching of
 the fingers resting on my head

   it is over-over

  holborn had spoken but it was not the sound of a
 human voice it was the shriek of an animal in pain
 we laid my dead uncle on his bed then holborn and
 i embraced and wept

   it was late at night a wonderfully clear night the
 sky was dotted with stars while the moon shone full
 and bright it was one of the most beautiful nights i
 experienced in australia

  we followed uncles wishes exactly no telegraph
 cried out the death of the chief all over the country
 it was to remain secret no solemn funeral procession
 followed him to the grave

   a great electric shovel sank its blades into the earth
 one of the mechanical men that he had made was dig-
 ging his last resting place with its iron arms

  the body rested in a great heavy metal coffin he
 himself had brought it from america years before the
 iron arms of our machines carried it out and lowered
 it into the grave the electric shovel then filled in the
 hole

  this was as uncle had desired at the grave stood
 only holborn and i and mormora while the savages
 danced the solemn death dance of their nation about the
 grave

epilogue

 it was a foggy day of early winter the storm wind
 had howled all day over berlin and now it was damp
 and unpleasant the people coming from the open
 gates of the factories hurried home

  walter gerhard was hurrying along he was now
 a man of about thirty still unmarried and a little em-
 bittered he had not yet succeeded in getting a place
 as an engineer the last five years he had been a master
 mechanic at the siemens plant glad of any port in the
 storm

   to-day he was different from his usual self he was
 excited during his work he had been even somewhat
 absent-minded now he was impatiently leaping up the
 steps of his dwelling in elsasserstrasse

   good evening frau miillensiefen

   heavens mr gerhard you are jumping like a boy

  he hurriedly entered the large room which he had
 taken over five years before when his friend fritz went
 on his mysterious journey he looked about

  everything is ready

  yes i put in my big table with ten chairs around it
and i also ordered a whole case of beer

   then it is all right

  frau miillensiefen stood in the doorway and looked
wondering at her boarder

   this isnt your birthday is it

  she waited in vain for an answer and then she
shook her head and went away grumbling

  meanwhile walter gerhard had stepped to his desk
unlocked it and taken out a thick packet it was a
manuscript enclosed in an envelope and the envelope
was stuck with a very large number of chinese stamps
and bore the shanghai postmark

  an hour later walter gerhard was no longer alone
with him were ten young men the same who had been
assembled in the patzenhofer in friedrichstrasse on the
thirty-first of march five years before one would
readily see that none of them had made much money
but it was equally obvious that they were serious per-
sons who knew how to work hard

  they greeted walter gerhard the president of their
little club in considerable surprise

  why have the meeting in your room to-day

  why not in the patzenhofer as usual

  you will soon see gerhard answered mysterious-

  all were now assembled and sitting about the great
table looking expectantly at gerhard who had placed
the packet before him on the table

  to-day is again the thirty-first of march you know
the remarkable event which exactly five years ago to-
day snatched our friend fritz from our midst in so
strange a manner you know that i myself accompanied
him to the flying field that evening that he went out
into the night alone in a plane provided for him by a
man named allister you also know that while i was
gazing after the departing plane this mr allister dis-
appeared without leaving a trace and that we have never
succeeded either in finding a sign of this mr allister
or obtaining word from our friend

  you know that we slowly came to the conviction
that he fell victim to some crime totally inexplicable to
us but this morning i suddenly got news of fritz
the friends sprang up news of fritz

  yes indeed very detailed news see it is almost a
book this extensive manuscript bears a chinese post-
mark was sent about six weeks ago and seemingly
comes from the interior of australia

  rudolph sperber started up from australia was
it not said at that time that fritz was to go to australia
with this mysterious mr allister

  other voices joined in the clamor

  what does he write then

  is he well

  dont keep us in suspense

  walter gerhard rapped on the table

  you must let me finish speaking in the letter ac-
company this manuscript it says neither more nor less
than that fritz is the possessor not only of many mil-
lions but also of a great part of australia which has a
very promising future likewise that he requests all
of us-do you hear the eleven of us who by chance art
au still united in friendship-to come to him and to
bring our families along in case we are married he
wants us to help him under most advantageous condi-
tions for us in further developing his colony which is
said to contain half a million square kilometers
	wonder stories quarterly

the long story

the ten young engineers leaped to their feet again
why that is incredible  said one

  how can there be such a colony exclaimed an-
other

  nobody ever heard of it

  such an undertaking

  there must have been something about it in the
papers

  we are living in the age of radio

  again walter gerhard rapped his house-key on the
table

  children you must be quiet all that you are
shouting at me i have of course said to myself al-
ready here is a manuscript it is a sort of auto-
biography which fritz has written it begins with the
thirty-first of march five years ago and ends about six
weeks ago with the sending of this letter from
shanghai all last night i was reading through these
remarkable accounts and thinking about them they
by no means give the impression that they were written
by a lunatic yet they are so full of absolutely in-
credible and puzzling things that i cannot pass judgment
myself

  i will tell you only one more thing beforehand i
said that fritz asks us all to come to him alone or with
our families in this letter was a check for five
thousand english pounds which is a hundred thousand
marks in german money it is payable at the deutsche
bank in berlin to-day i used my noon-hour to go to
the deutsche bank the check is good and will be
cashed at once if the eleven of us will together sign a
receipt for it we are supposed to divide the amount
into equal parts in case one died in the meantime his
heirs were supposed to step into his place since all
eleven of us are together there is nothing to prevent
our cashing this check to be sure the letter shows that
it is his wish that we use the money to come to him

  before the rest could speak again gerhard raised his
hand

  it seems to me that the simplest thing will be for
us to sit here about the table while i read you the entire
autobiography which fritz has written even if it does
last several hours then when you have all heard it
we will exchange our views about it and take counsel
together

  they seated themselves about the great table and
passed beer and cigars around they were all full of
excitement and anticipation walter gerhard began
to read the strange stoiy fritz had written from the
moment when in despair about the continual letters of
rejection he received the puzzling letter from mr al-
lister on that thirty-first of march five years before un-
til the hour when he lowered his uncle into the grave
and promised himself that he would continue his work

  midnight was long past when walter gerhard laid
aside the last page of the manuscript outside the
wintry storm was rattling the windows blowing the
first snow against the panes

  here in the room sat the eleven young men with
glowing faces silently breathless all had listened to
the strange things which gerhard had read to them

  what do you say now

  after a pause rudolf sperber began it is a com-
plete puzzle it all sounds so simple and true yet it
must be impossible

  another jumped up and strode up and down in ex-
citement it must be a mistake the check which you

have cannot be paid poor fritz is not in his right
mind-perhaps he is in an insane asylum

  another put in how can there be a large colony in
australia about which no one knows anything

  otto walzmiiller arose he was a deep thinker who
concerned himself much with chemical things wait
a minute said he wasnt there really an item in the
papers two or three years ago telling about extraordin-
ary discoveries of radium in the deserts of australia
gustav schmelling pressed both hands to his head
i remember something else about a year ago the
observatory reported that a remarkable body a sort of
meteor had risen up in the south-east-somewhere in
the vicinity of australia-coming from the earth the
thing was observed by only two observatories and was
taken to be an error or else an attempt to send an ether
rocket up into space

  all that proves nothing this manuscript comes
from a lunatic perhaps he too heard of these things
and wove them into an incredible story

it is true

walter calmly allowed them all to express them-
selves then he said all these ideas came to me
also but i have discarded them besides say what you
will this check is genuine and will be paid therefore
there is no question that fritz has the disposal of such
a sum i have another plan each of us will manage
to get a few hours off tomorrow the matter is worth
it tomorrow i shall make inquiries at the australian
embassy they must know something there you
walzmiiller will investigate about the radium dis-
covery you schmelling will inquire at the observa-
tory regarding the meteor you grutzmacher have in-
formation at hand about san francisco perhaps you
can find out whether in the last few years great pur-
chases of machinery were sent from there to this mys-
terious mr schmidt you himmelsbach are in the
meteorological institute and can make inquiries about
rain-making you walter are to go to the geo-
graphical institute and try to learn what is actually
going on in the interior of australia

  it was about two in the morning when the young
people of course greatly excited went out into the night

  it was the next evening frau miillensiefen was
greatly surprised that she again had to set up the great
table and the chairs the eleven friends again assembled
punctually

  gerhard began i was at the australian embassy
the official was extremely discourteous and at first re-
fused all information finally he admitted that five
years ago a tract of the australian desert was sold to
what he called a crazy american named schmidt fur-
thermore i ascertained from old australian papers the
following established fact that at exactly the same time
as fritz gives the then president of the australian minis-
try albernoon suddenly had to resign and that he was
reproached for having foolishly sold very great treasures
of australia to this american schmidt

  herbert griitzmacher arose i have been able to
prove that in recent years the american machinery fac-
tories have made extraordinary shipments of electrical
and agricultural machines of all kinds likewise railroad
equipment to an american named schmidt that the
same person bought a great number of freight-steamers
in san francisco and that these with all the machinery
purchased went out into the pacific the destination al-
ways being kept secret

himmelsbach tendered his report such attempts to
electropolis

make rain as fritz describes are recognized and also
successful on a small scale the investigators are not
yet sure whether it is possible on a large scale it has
however been observed that in the last few years cloud
formations have actually been seen over the continent of
australia

  attempts have been made to investigate the path-
less regions by airplane but the australian govern-
ment which does not permit other nations to make such
attempts claims that remarkable currents of air have
arisen there which make it impossible for any plane to
fly to the interior or which rather turn back all planes
again

  gerhard sprang up that is the effect of the rin-
dell-matthews rays the electric wall and the distant
control about which fritz told

  the geographical institute confirm the impossibility
of making more exact investigation of the interior of
australia on account of the ton imposed by the aus-
tralian government

  finally walzmiiller said i have been unable to learn
anything about the discovery of radium in australia
hut in recent years a most extraordinary amount of
radium has been put on the market by america in fact
through a certain mr schmidt in san francisco he
would however give no hint as to the source of this
radium

  for a time deep silence prevailed among the young
people then gerhard took the floor again his voice
trembling with intense emotion

  my dear friends after all that we have heard we
may no longer doubt that not only has this mysterious
mr schmidt actually lived but also our dear friend
fritz has spoken the truth in everything

  no one contradicted this all were deeply moved
and some in the outburst of feeling put their arms about
the shoulders of their friends

  gerhard continued but if all this is true then it is
a mighty thing which is arising there not merely an
incredibly clever utilization of all the technical electrical
and chemical forces of our earth but also a new sort of
peaceful conquering of the world

  australia has perceived that it is powerless against



this conquest for all of us and for our fatherland
however it can be of infinite significance our friend
has taken upon himself the heritage of his dead uncle
he has called upon us to come to him-we who have
been consuming ourselves in the vain struggle here-
and to help him to construct it further he has richly
provided us with the means to go to him but he asks
of all of us our word of honor to remain silent at pres-
ent about the work which is being developed i shall
keep this word of honor i have already resigned my
position and i am going to fritz who is coming with
me

  one after another stepped up to him and held out his
hand i too me and mine as well

  then the eleven stood about the table with hands
clasped their eyes shining with inspired hope

  it is eight days later the steamer sierra ventarn of
the north german lloyd is leaving bremerhafen our
eleven friends are on board six of them with young
wives and little children the steamer is headed out to
sea with the destination eastern asia

  walter gerhard is holding in his hand a radiogram
which he has just received it reads thus

  hurrah two of my zeppelins will be awaiting you
at colombo in ceylon fritz

  the glowing sun is blazing down on the coast of
australia the scorching heat keeps away all living
things only over electropolis for several hours a day
there are black clouds

  the sierra ventara has left the suez canal and is
steaming across the open sea toward colombo

  the eleven and their families are expectantly longing
for the end of the voyage will the great airships be
there will they transport their passengers into the
land of mystery is all this miracle actually true

  is there a city of machines in the midst of the desert
is the mighty power plant humming and working away
in its subterranean cavern with all kinds of rays flow-
ing from its wires-this plant the heart of this miracu-
lous region

  will they find it the new germany of the future
will the mysterious land of the iron arms become
home to them

the monsters of neptune

henrik dahl juve

by the author of the vanishing fleet ffstreamers of death etc

jp manson president of the consolidated
interplanetary transport co was agitated and

	he expressed it as becomes a gentleman of refine-
ment-he frowned and he blew smoke at his mahogany
desk his ancestors had been pioneers in space travel
and they had left him with one of the leading interplanet-
ary freight and passenger lines manson himself was a
pioneer in that he was the first of his family to abandon
the hard and rough life of a pioneer
and sit back to an easy life of social
prestige and enjoyment he flecked
a bit of ash from his bright yellow
silk clothes a pajama-like affair
that was the prevailing fashion of
the day and again frowned care-
fully

  the door of the richly furnished
office opened leisurely the drone
and clatter of the main office con-
taminated the luxury and dignity of
the inner sanctum a young man
walked into the room with his
walking stick he pushed the door to
and sauntered over to the desk
where he sank into a deep chair he
was clad in a purple suit similar in
cut to that of the older mans but
threads of gold were interwoven
with the silk to form an intricate
pattern it was the
sports model the
campus extreme

  you sent for me
dad  he asked as he
fitted a cigarette in
a jeweled holder
and reached for the
lighter on the desk

  yes i sent for
you i have come to
a decision

really  and how
does it affect me

you talk inriddles

  manson was al-
most angry people
regarded him in awe
but dana was very
complacent and a
trifle droll regarding
the family bank roll
and social power

  you simply must
get to work the
older man continued

you are dragging the name of manson through the
papers you are considered the laziest dreamer in the
city even the comic strips are picking you up as good
material for ridicule it has gone too far-you must
get to work do you understand work

  dana leisurely blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceil-
ing i understand a lot more than you and the papers
give me credit for i am not lazy at all but i simply
havent found anything that i care to do

that is the old excuse-we have been over that

 our author seems to improve with each story
 in the present interplanetarian story we get
 the adventures of two explorers on neptune
 one of the little known planets of our solar system

   mr juve has that rare ability of making his story
 live for he has studied the atmosphere of the places
 he writes about and given us that local color which
 is so necessary when describing a strange planet

   the developments of this story may seem to some
 of us to be humorous especially when we consider
 the superstitions of the neptunians yet we modem
 civilized earthlings cannot afford to be so superior
 for if we were to examine our own habits and cus-
 toms we might find that we also guide our lives by
 things just as silly and pointless as those which move
 the neptunians

   our author in this story has not only given us a
 vivid picture of the life on a planet wholly different
 than ours but he has provided a story full of dra-
 matic situations and thrilling adventures

before i have decided to retire and turn over to you
the control of the lines that should give you something
to do

  you retire dana laughed but of course you need
a vacation all you do is to take in the money and enjoy
life and now you want me to do the same thing id go
crazy you have been hauling water to the people on
mercury and exchanging it weight for weight for gold

                  now you have so much gold here
                  that you are offering prizes to people
                  who can think up new uses for the
                  stuff you have settled back and are
                  coasting on the energy of our an-
                  cestors another generation of this
                  kind of control and the name man-
                  son will be in the help wanted col-
                  umns no i dont want to run the
                  outfit

                    what in heavens name do you
                  want to do then nothing you
                  are too lazy even to make yourself
                  agreeable in society

                       dana shrugged i dont like the
                    society you talk about it bores me
                    what i really want to do is to ex-
                    plore neptune

                     mansons jaw sagged limply he
                   stared at his son in startled amaze-
                   ment finally he recovered his voice

  explore n e p -
tune he almost
groaned have you
gone crazy

  of course not i
have been thinking
of it for years i
positively refuse to
sit around here and
go stale when there
is another world to
explore you haul
tourists into the very
clouds of neptune
but you are afraid to
land i want to land
and see what the
place looks like
preposterous  i
positively refuse to
let you go you
know just as well as
i that every expedi-
tion that ever went
there has never come
back they were
armed with the latest guns and death rays-but they
never came out of the clouds no youll not go

  humph and if your great grandfather back in 
had been afraid to fly to mars youd be shoveling snow
for a living whats the difference if i do get killed
anything is better than this

a startling announcement

manson sagged in his chair i have been afraid
of it i have been afraid that you were a throw-
	wonder stories quarterly

back a pioneer an explorer i have tried to guard you
against the spirit of your ancestors just to keep you out
of danger but ill keep you out of danger in spite of
yourself he said with unusual bitterness ill not let
you go

  youd rather have me sit around here and die of
overeating dana retorted sarcastically no i want
to visit neptune i have always felt that that is what i
am cut out to do and that is what i want to do

  no you take over the business get married and
settle down

  dana went over to the window and gzed dejectedly
out

  terriana wont marry me until i do something to
show the world that im worth my salt he said bitterly
and i dont blame her even if she were willing her
dad would raise the house

  terriana isnt the only girl in the world

  for me she is

  for once the elder manson fumed without reserve
dana leaned against the window sill gazing out his
handsome bold features were clouded with thought
he ran his fingers through his reddish brown hair
something of triumph stole into his eyes and he turned
to his father

  if i take over the business will you let me run it
any way i please he asked

  the older man straightened and brightened abso-
lutely i am glad to hear that you are coming to your
senses you may run it with a high hand or run it onto
the rocks you may divide it up among the employees or
give it to the poor i dont care how you run it and ill
not interfere ill sit back and watch your work and say
nothing unless you come to me for information or
advice

  all right ill take charge right now

  manson was elated he called in the two vice-presi-
dents and outlined the arrangement to them sour little
drisden who had had his eye on the presidents chair
looked positively ill but terrianas father big powerful
lozier was hearty in his congratulations he seemed
more pleased than manson himself

  now said dana when the surprise and congratu-
lations had subsided well carry on according to our
present policy until i get back

  his indolence had dropped from him like a worn-out
cloak and he had become a man of decision and force

  get back manson almost shouted what do you
mean 

  from neptune i am in charge of this transport com-
pany now and i am going to neptune to establish an
outpost if there is anything there to warrant our exten-
sion

  again the elder manson sagged in his chair the load
that had been lifted so suddenly now rested heavier than
ever upon his broad shoulders his face was gray lozier
was too astonished to speak sour little drisden looked
at the presidents chair once more and could scarcely
keep his face from wrinkling the wrong way dana never
had liked him

  if i dont come back he added lozier will take
my place as president

  drisden left the room

chapter ii
through the clouds

the newspapers were dumbfounded when they
learned of danas proposed exploration terriana
was repentant but in the face of a thousand warn-
ings and pleadings dana went about his preparations

calmly yet persistently he had advertised for men to
accompany him but only one agreed to go he was
dutch hoss a stolid blocky man serving a life sen-
tence in the penitentiary he was not criminally minded
but had made the mistake of hitting too hard a man
with a weak heart he was good natured and slow to
anger but a savage when aroused through his influ-
ence dana had induced the board to parole the man
over to him they had consented on the excuse that it
would save the state the expense of keeping him and get
him out of the way at the same time

   at last the machine guns and one of the newly-devel-
 oped death ray machines were mounted in danas own
 sport interplanetary cruiser with a last farewell to the
 throng about them they entered the toroidal flyer and
 closed the door while dana took the controls and turned
 on the cosmoray dutch sat down and complacently rolled
 a smoke

   the ship picked up speed rapidly and was soon hur-
tling through space at full speed about one tenth the
speed of light

   how longll it take us to get to neptune dutch
asked between puffs

  the earth and neptune are in opposition so the
straight line distance is nearly three billion miles but
we have to make a wide detour around the sun so it will
take us fully four days

   four days dutch exclaimed but we aint in a
hurry this beats sitting around in the pen when do
we eat

   they passed th blazing sun awe-inspiring despite
the many times they had seen the heaving mass dutch
who had served as oiler on board one of the earth-
satum freighters knew something about the handling of
the ship and was able to relieve dana at the controls
thus for nearly four days the two alternated at the
control board the galley and the sleeping quarters in-
cidentally becoming fast friends

   at last the huge formidable bulk of neptune loomed
 an immense sphere directly before them they were
 now bn the edge of explored space only the new ninth
 planet minerva about which little was yet known lay
 beyond dana had thought of visiting the outer planet
 but somehow neptune seemed more attractive with a
 feeling of sinister foreboding he viewed the mysterious
 neptune shrouded in a thick blanket of clouds moving
 majestically through space scornful of the puny efforts
 of man to probe his eternal secret

   dana took the controls and reduced the speed as they
 neared the clouds cautiously he flew into the first filmy
 shreds of vapor and then sank at a snails pace through
 the impenetrable dripping bank of fog

   hour after hour they dropped through the clouds
they could not see more than a few inches beyond the
windows so were afraid of striking something their
descent was little faster than normal landing speed they
had gone through nearly four miles of fog when they
noticed that the clouds began to thin dana reduced the
speed still more and finally they were beneath the en-
velope and only five hundred feet above the ground
he locked the controls in neutral and the ship hung mo-
tionless in the air

   come here and look dutch called from one of the

    shaped like a doughnut the new flyers were built in this doughnut
 shape to facilitate the action of the cosmoray the cosmoray is a flux
 similar to magnetism set up by the action of electricity d since an
 extract from tbe sap of the yucca tree was the only known conductor
 of electricity d the ccils in the ship consisted of copper tubing con-
 taining the liquid extract the tubing serving both as container and
 insulator twenty-two turns of the tubing were laid against the inner
 wall of the doughnut the flux or cosmoray set up in this solinoid
 caused the ship to move in any direction-with respect to cosmic rays
 -according to the operators selection of flux orientation and polarity
the monsters of neptune	

windows in the bottom of the craft do we have to land
in that mess

  dana left the control board and peered through the
window a great jungle spread out below them huge
almost white trees struggled high into the air while great
tangles of thick heavy vines tried to pull them back
steam rose from the tangled mass and lost itself in
the dank air it was as if one had lifted a board from
the ground and examined the greenish-white vegetation
beneath the whole scene was lighted by a weird violet
light slightly less brilliant than sunlight on the earth yet
brighter than moonlight

  dana turned off the lights in the ship and dropped
closer to the ground again he joined dutch at the
window

  now he noticed a strange thing the only light in the
cabin now came through the window it shone upon
his companions face and cast over it a ghastly hue his
cheeks and lips were utterly devoid of color his face
had more the appearance of a mass of pasty dough than
that of a human countenance

  dutch looked up i dont- he began and then
stopped in amazement whats the matter with you
scared you look like a corpse

  dana laughed no im not scared your face is no
more colorful that is because no red rays from the suns
light penetrates this atmosphere what do you think of
things

  the whole thing looks queer to me you especially
i get the creeps every time you turn toward me

  i hope that i dont look any worse than you do-
youre terrible

  but we cant waste our time passing compliments
well have to find a place to land lets open the door
and see what the air is like

  dana tried to pull the door open but the pressure
within the ship was greater than that without and he
found that the door was held against the rubber seal
with tremendous force he compared the pressures
indicated by the gauges on the control panel and then
opened a valve in the side of the ship the air inside
hissed and whistled as it escaped in a short time the
pressures were equalized and he swung the door open
he sniffed the air gingerly at first but could detect no ill
effects it was permeated by a queer musty odor

  the air smells like an old rotten cellar with a new
cedar door he informed dutch lets find a place to
land

a strange land

dana banged the door shut and again took the con-
trols they flew along at a three hundred-foot level
searching for a suitable place to land after traveling for
perhaps fifty miles over the impenetrable jungle dutch
who was on the lookout spied a rocky opening where
there was no vegetation other than a few serpentine
vines

  theres a place he called swing over a few
points to the left-there

  when they were over the spot dana lowered the
ship until they were close to the ground after lock-
ing the controls he examined the terrain but nothing
moved with a pair of binoculars he scrutinized it
more carefully and then searched the surrounding trees
but nothing stirred the air itself seemed to be
stagnant and lifeless

  he returned to the controls and lowered the ship
until it rested upon the yellow ground they opened
the door and ventured outside the air was heavy and
oppressive despite the dank air they felt strangely

light for their weights were only three-fourths of that
on the surface of the earth

  boy i feel young again said dutch if we only
had some decent air to breathe this wouldnt be such a
bad place to live where do we go now

  i think that we better fly around the planet before
we do anything else said dana we cant get very
far in that jungle

  they climbed back into the ship and flew swiftly
above the jungle and oceans the oceans were great
bodies of steaming water that lay as motionless as
mirrors

  how big is this place dutch asked when they had
flown for an hour and had found little change

  its about a hundred thousand miles around said
dana

  gee theres room for lots of politicians here dutch
grinned and i dont see even a buzzard

  on the side of the planet away from the sun where
they had expected to find darkness they were astonished
to find very little points of light dana was puzzled and
at a complete loss to explain it

   at last on the shore of a great placid lake they found
a wide clearing something had happened to leave it
almost devoid of vegetation as far as they could see
there were rocky pinnacles and great rolling hills of
solid rock near the edge of the jungle a shallow river
meandered among the hills and emptied into the lake
beyond the river the gullies gradually merged with the
hill tops to form a plateau

  dana lowered the ship and settled it gently upon the
top of a low hill beyond the river

  lets get out here and look around he suggested
wed better take that little machine gun along or
maybe better the portable death ray

  they opened the locker in which the light gun was
kept the gun was there and in it was a full drum of
cartridges but their pare ammunition had been taken
out

  i know that i checked that over carefully said
dana in astonishment i wonder-

  quickly he went to the death ray machine and turned
it on but the tubes failed to glow he opened the locker
in which spare tubes were kept-but it was empty

  of all the dirty-say i know who did it if i had
drisden here id break him in two

  better be careful-he might have a weak heart said
dutch i hit a skunk once

  but he lias tried to commit murder i-oh well
what is the use of crying about it ill attend to him
when we get back come on

  they left the ship and descended the hill briskly
they walked along a draw that wound around the next
hill suddenly dana stopped as if he had forgotten
something

  i know why the light here is so ghastly the sun
shines on the planet like about seven hundred full moons
but not much of the light gets through the heavy clouds
most of the light coires up from the ground and they
forgot to send up any red light notice that you dont
cast a shadow on the ground but if you hold your hand
up above your head your hand is in a shadow
a-huh said dutch thats why they dont have
any night here i spose wouldnt the electric light
company weep

  they had gone around another hill and were ascending
a steep pitch from which they could see the lake on
the distant shore dana noticed something bright steam
	wonder stories quarterly

billowed into the air as though water were being poured
into a furnace

  lets go over there dana suggested its too far
to walk-well take the ship

  they began retracing their steps when then heard a
taint thump they stopped to listen again they heard
the thump

  lets hurry dana said worriedly i wonder what
that noise is

the great menace

they ran down the hill and around through the
draws as they drew nearer the ship the thumps
became louder there was a metallic sound inter-
mingled they rounded the last hill and came in sight
of their ship they stared at it aghast and dismayed it
was battered almost beyond recognition

  cautiously they advanced up the hill over the snake-
like vines and through the pale grass dana carried the
machine gun in readiness and advanced ahead of dutch
they heard a loud thump and saw the edge of the ship
quiver but they were now on the slope of the hill from
where they could not see the other side of their craft
another thud and the ship danced under the impact

  dutch flared with anger he started up the hill at a
wild pace forgetful of all danger

  hey dana called what is the idea wait a
minute until we find out what is doing that

  but theyre breaking the ship im going to stop
them in their tracks

  and get stopped no you wait until we find out
what is there

  they were at the crest of the hill now and peered over
one look and they crouched down behind a rock and
stared into each others pasty faces dana felt his blood
chill and his face blanch he wondered how dutch
felt he recovered himself and slipped the safety catch
on the rapid fire gun and poked it up over the rock he
trained the gun upon the monster

   a huge pale violet-grey gorilla-like beast stood poised
above the remains of the ship it was more bulky than
any elephant its powerful body was covered with great
slab-like scales that rattled with the least motion its
wide ugly head covered with scales was frightful the
one eye in the center of its forehead gleamed yellow-
violet light of hate and triumph

  dana was paralyzed before this apparition he tried
to squeeze the trigger but he could not move

  in his powerful arms the monster held a boulder that
weighed half a ton or more slowly with a loud rattle
of scales he raised it in his herculean hands until it was
high above his head

shoot him dutch almost screamed shoot

  as if another were doing it dana pressed the trigger
the gun jerked and rattled with deafening explosions
the angry steel nosed bullets struck sparks on the thick
scales but the beast paid not the slightest heed

  with a mighty heave the neptunian brought the
boulder down upon the ship the rock struck with a
clanking thud bits of debris flew the already use-
less ship was flattened still more again dana fired a
burst at the center of the beast and again the sparks
flew the creature aroused at last began looking about
for the source of the annoyance he spied the two be-
hind the boulder and charged

  dana felt his blood congeal he fired several desper-
ate bursts at the oncoming mountain of heaving scales
but he might as well have been firing a pop gun their
antagonist came on dana could neither move nor run

he was hypnotized by the destruction bearing down
upon them the one yellow eye of blazing hate held
him transfixed

  in the eye dutch screamed shoot him in the
eye

  mechanically dana raised the gun and again pressed
the trigger the beast merely shook its gargantuan
head and came on frantically dana again took aim
the monster was now but twenty feet from them and
towering like an invincible army tank for the fourth
time dana put the gun to its utmost it was the last
desperate struggle and it steadied him the bullets
stitched a row of sparks across the hideous face and
drew closer to that blazing eye desperately he held the
trigger down and guided the chattering stream of steel
across the monsters forehead suddenly the blazing
yellow eye went dead the light went out

             chapter iii
             into the jungle

the monster stopped abruptly with a terrible shriek
of pain and surprise it halted emitted another
deafening bellow that reverberated among the
hills and then pitched to the ground with a thud that
fairly shook the rocks he lay there threshing about
kicking rocks and boulders in every direction

  trembling and weak the two stared at their dead foe
dutch lapsed into profanity but dana merely stared

  listen dana hissed suddenly sh-h

  far in the distance they could hear answering shrieks
and bellows they stared at each other with a groan
they listened intently and could hear the throb of many
heavy feet and knew that others were coming rapidly
the very ground trembled under the impact like the
rumble of a freight train

  hopelessly they looked at their ship but it was ground
and battered beyond recognition

  to the jungle dana yelled we cant fight the
whole herd

  the edge of the jungle was about two miles away and
they set out as fast as they could travel  they had
gone down into a valley across the small river and
topped another hill before they looked back the great
herd was just drawing up to the remains of the ship
they estimated that there were over two hundred of
the gruesome violet-grey monsters while they rested
they watched the neptunians they could hear the
turmoil of clattering scales and bellowing voices

  the beasts first attacked what was left of the ship
they threw hundreds of great boulders upon it and then
lifted it up on edge and rolled it down the hill faster
and faster the flattened doughnut rolled until it suddenly
broke into a shower of fragments then one of the
grotesque creatures saw the earth things there was a
screech and the whole band broke into an uproar four
of them seized the carcase of their dead cjmpanion and
the entire troop came in hot pursuit amid a rattling chaos
and a cloud of steam

  run dana cried in terror can we make it 

  dutch had become stolid again now that the fright-
ful creatures were still far off

  we can try he grinned whats the difference if
we make it or not theyll get us sooner or later

  they broke into a run toward the tangled forest the
beasts seeing them escaping came on thunderously in
full cry the ground rumbled with their heavy run-
ning and the air rattled and vibrated from their clatter-
ing scales and deafening voices

  gradually the herd gained upon them they aban-
the monsters of neptune	

doned caution and rushed wildly across the damp rocky
ground when they were within three hundreds yards
of the sheltering jungle dana glanced back the thun-
dering horde was less than two hundred yards behind
and gaining rapidly

   we cant make it he gasped im going to-
 throw away-the gun its about-empty anyway

    without waiting for an answer he dropped the gun
 he felt nude and helpless without the weapon but he
 ran easier and faster without the burden there was an
 increased uproar behind and he glanced back the
 beasts has stopped to demolish the gun

    hurry i he yelled between gasps theyre grind-
 ing up-the gun

   they gained the thicker underbrush and found it
 crossed and recrossed by many paths selecting one of
 these they staggered on abruptly they were up to the
 tangled mass of jungle each of the paths entered a
 great hole in the confused growth they plunged into
 one of these holes and found themselves in a steaming
 dripping perspiring tunnel the rich yellow soil of the
 path was trampled by thousands of cumbersome feet
 into a soft mud there was an abrupt turn in the tunnel
 and dana glanced back as he rounded it the first of
 the beasts were just entering the opening

    quick  he gasped crawl out-of the path-here
 they come

    they found a space between a huge tree and the tangle
  of vines and squeezed into it they pushed and pried
  their way around the tree and crouched trembling and
  gasping beside the almost white trunk they had scarce-
  ly hidden themselves when the first of the grotesque be-
  ings clattered by they were closely followed by the
  four carrying the dead animal and then an almost end-
  less chain of rattling scales and thundering splashing
  feet yellow mud sloshed up against and around their
  tree until they were drenched

what now

 the last of the stragglers rattled by and the pro-
 cession lost itself in the depths of the jungle
 while they recovered their breaths they listened to the
 sound of the monsters as it grew fainter ini the dis-
 tance

   dutch shoved some vines out of his way and lay
 down flat on his back he wiped the perspiration from
 his face with the back of his hand and proceeded to roll
 a smoke

    well he said as he moistened the edge of the brown
  paper mr president of the consolidated interplane-
  tary transport company where do we go from here

    dana did not answer he was thinking of terriana
 he wondered if she was worrying about him-he hoped
 so

    is there any chance of someone coming to help us 
  dutch persisted if someone forgets to come for us
  well have to get acquainted with the natives and pre-
  tend that we like it

   dana shook his head there isnt a chance in a
 million you couldnt hire anyone to come here and
 even if someone did how could they find us it would
 be about like flying over the state of california looking
 for a needle someone dropped dad might try to come
 but i dont think that mother would let him shed tell
 him that one lost from the family is enough no itll
 be just like it was with the others the telenewspapers
 will buzz for awhile and then theyll make room for the
 next sensation and forget all about us well have to do
 our own worrying

  dutch drew deeply at his cigarette oh well we
should worry this is no worse than sitting around in
the pen

  say  dana flared angrily are you kidding or are
you just plain dumb

  dutch grinned a pasty-faced grin that was ghastly in
the weird light i spose it all depends on how much
you lose me-he shrugged all im losing is a cot
and a lot of steel scenery

  dana dug his heel savagely in the wet yellow dirt
he looked about the putrid tangle of dripping steaming
trees and vines the dead ones of which were decaying
in mid air he decided that he would have to do his
own thinking perhaps the companionship of dutch
would keep him from going insane if the man did not
drive him crazy with his stolid fateful indifference

  if i had something to eat now dutch continued
id fill up and then sleep awhile my big worry comes
around three times a day did you ever get real hungry
and nothing in sight

  will you shut up dana almost shrieked dont
we have enough trouble without your rubbing it in

  but dutchs suggestion was practical dana began
to worry about what they could eat in this land of plenty
the more he thought about it the more convinced he
was that there was only one course open to them

  we had better follow that herd and watch them he
said we can probably live on the same kind of stuff
they eat if we begin experimenting we might eat some-
thing thats poisonous

chapter iv
the grotto of the beafts

hour after hour they traveled through the mud
splashed tunnel there were many criss-crossed
paths but they had no difficulty in following the
herd for the path they had used was newly churned and
the sides of the tunnel were dripping with ocher mud
at last they heard faintly the sound of rattling scales
and the bellowing of voices far in the distance they
advanced more cautiously now for they were afraid of
ambush or an outpost

  at last they came to a turn in the tunnel and could
hear that the cavalcade was just ahead dana peered
cautiously around the bend and drew back quickly

  the whole band is around there in a clearing i
thing that theyre resting and eating lets see if we
can burrow out of the tunnel and get ringside seats
they searched the matted sides of the tunnel until
they found a place where the vegetation was not so
heavy and wormed their way through there was no
danger of their presence being detected through any
sound they made for the din of the neptunians was
deafening at last they arrived near the edge of the
clearing and could plainly see the monsters

  they were eating and the two visitors watched care-
fully several of the great animals had swung into the
nearby trees with the agility of monkeys from their
position they dropped fruit to others below there
were several varieties that they ate the fruit was pale
green or pale yellow their coloring being so slight that
they were almost white there seemed to be one
favorite a bean-like affair of a yellow tint and about ten
feet long there was one hanging from a vine near
dutchs head and they opened it inside they found
twenty soft meated flat white fruits they were some
five inches in diameter and two inches thick dana
tasted the fruit it was juicy and delicious tasting
	wonder stories quarterly

something like a combination of apricots and strawber-
ries

  dana ate a little as an experiment but dutch ate free-
ly-

  better not eat too much to start with dana warned
well know more about how it agrees with us after
awhile

  it tastes fine-i should worry about what happens

  dana shrugged dutch was impossible to reason with
they tried other fruits which they had seen the na-
tives eat and found them good one in particular in-
terested dana it was a nearly transparent clear globe
about ten inches in diameter which hung from a vine
like a great drop of dew he bit into one and was al-
most drowned in the sweet fragrant juice

  at last the neptunians went on the march again
four of them picked up the dead member of their herd
and clanked into a tunnel opening into the far side of
the open space when they were out of sight dana and
his companion started after them

  i dont see what we are following them for any
longer said dana we know what they eat so can
live without them still if we watch them we can find
out more about them if we have to live here the rest
of our lives we had better learn all we can about their
habits

  for hours they followed the noisome procession on
the earth it would have been several days still the
neptunians continued deeper into the jungle as they
progressed they found the jungle becoming denser until
no light filtered in from thej translucent cloud above
the only illumination now was the ghastly violet light
from the ground

  they had followed for six sleeps as dutch put it
-for there were no days and nights-when they noticed
that the din ahead became louder

  cautiously they advanced but they found that they
were several miles away as they drew nearer they
noticed that the sound came in a definite rhythm as
though the beasts were keeping time the ground shook
under the thump of countless and massive feet at last
they came upon the assembled horde and concealed them-
selves in the dense foliage

  before them opened a vast amphitheater or grotto
the room was at least three hundred feet across the
dome-shaped ceiling was a hundred feet high in the cen-
ter and composed of living dripping vines not even
a pencil of light found its way through the dense mat-
ting in the center lay the dead neptunian and around
it danced the vast herd it was a grotesque dance of
rattling scales and thumping feet to one side eight
of the monsters beat time by bumping great hollow logs
with heavy rocks the ghastly light came from the
ground and cast a weird shadow dance of distorted
shapes on the ceiling of the grotto

the mystery of the lighi

they watched the thunderous dance for two hours
when there was a sudden change in the rhythm of
the drums the dance speeded up and then the entire
herd broke into line and filed away through an opening
in the wall while another troop of dancers came into the
grotto and resumed the bacchanalian contortions

  looks like only part of em chased us dutch
shouted above the din whats it all about

  probably a wake said dana they arent animals
but savages

  they resumed their observation of the ponderous
dance when dana noticed something that had escaped his

attention before near one edge of the grotto he saw
a tiny red light that gleamed steadily in the ghastly violet
light he wfas puzzled when he noticed that all the
beasts or savages carefully avoided the light refusing
to go nearer to it than fifty feet at the left edge of
this forbidden circle stood one of the neptunians as
motionless as a statue

  see that red spot over there he asked dutch
there-no right over beyond that fellow with a crook-
ed nose

  oh yes now i see it whats it for

how should i know lets go over and find out
they started through the maze of vines and under-
brush but came upon one of the tunnels the ground
was literally covered by the monsters lying in the steam-
ing mud evidently resting

  well have to wait until they change shifts dutch
said lets go back

  they crawled back to their former position and
watched the proceedings

id like to know what that red light is for dana
mused and why is that native standing over there
the visitors indulged in another of their sleeps to
the tune of booming logs rattling scales and thundering
feet still the grotesque wake continued

  wish i was selling tickets for this dance dutch
grinned id charge so much a ton

  if you were i suppose youd buy lots somewhere
around here with the proceeds and settle down dana
retorted id give everything i own for an old second
hand spaceflyer right now

  dutch snorted how do you figure that you own
anything on the earth when youre settled down here for
life forget it

  thats right but dont rub it in too much-its all in
how much you lose you said

  sure but we are stuck here and we might as well
face the music i have been thinking that i was wrong
it doesnt really make any difference how much you
lose whether you lose a nickel or half the world-
whats the difference

  i wasnt thinking of money dana said sadly

   they lapsed into silence and listened to the nerve-rack-
ing monotonous thump thump rattle rattle again
there was a sudden change in the time and rhythm of
the dance they looked up to watch any new develop-
ments tunnels poured out their inhabitants until the
grotto was filled there were hundreds of the scaly
monsters although the grotto was crowded they all
carefully avoided that red light

  the dance became wilder and wilder they seemed
to be working themselves into a frenzy as the dance
speeded up the clatter became deafening and the ground
jarred with the heavy thump of stamping feet the
monsters grew frantic swaying to the hollow-log time
the crowd milling about the dead member

  suddenly the thumping ceased and the milling herd
came to an abrupt halt for a moment they stood mo-
tionless as if recovering their balance a moment of
this silence and then the mob quivered a wave of bel-
lowing swept over them and a deadly rattle of scales
as one they rushed toward the carcass they were
upon the dead member when one of the foremost sud-
denly drew himself up over the heads of the others and
ran over the top of the solidly packed herd

  whats he think hes going to do dutch asked
tensly

  dana was awed by this strange ceremony he did not
answer but watched the lone member leap from the
the monsters of neptune	

heads of the others and rush to the red light quickly he
seized the miniature torch and with a loud bellow he ran
toward the thundering crowd the others drew back
clearing a path for him he waved the light the only
spark of red in this ghastly violet land and the mob
drew farther back as in awe and reverence as with a
magic wand he cleared a wide circle about the dead
member danced around it three times and then set the
sceptre upright in the ground

another human 

with his great thumbless hands he tore the carcass
open and took out the heart which he held up for
all to see again he went through some meaningless
ceremonies seized the little red-tipped wand and went
toward the edge of the grotto through the wide lane that
opened for him he set the light where he had found
it and disappeared into one of the tunnels carrying his
extra heart with him

  again the crowd fell upon the dead member and after
a few minutes of wild confusion they drew away leav-
ing nothing but a scattered litter of scales and bluish
grey bones

  u-uh said dana they eat their own dead i
wonder why all the ceremony

  what im wondering is what theyd do to us if they
caught us

  dana shuddered i had that figured out long ago
id rather try to figure out why all the ceremony and
why the long wait before they ate that dead one
probably waiting for the scales to loosen dutch
suggested

  for the-wait what is this

  the one who had eaten the heart came out of his
tunnel and stood behind the red-tipped wand the
herd stood in awe and respect in a loud voice the one
addressed the many several times he bellowed chang-
ing the pitch of his voice from high screeches to low
gutturals the speech was short and evidently to the
point for scarcely had he ceased when the herd broke
up and scattered through the many tunnels several
gathered up the debris of scales and bones and carried
them into a tunnel the mighty one picked up his
torch called a band of about seventy-five and led them
into another tunnel slowly the clatter and thunder died
away in the distance only one remained in the vast
grotto-the guard

  now we can crawl around there and see what that
guard is doing dana suggested

  its sure a funny outfit said dutch

  not so queer dana objected when people from
mars came to the earth for the first time they thought
that we were the strangest things they could imagine
and we thought the same about them now we dont
think anything about it because were used to them and
have adopted some of their customs these monsters
if they think at all probably think that we are queer little
animals with silly habits

  i spose youre right lets go

  now that the crashing din had ceased they had to
move with extreme caution carefully they burrowed
through the almost impenetrable tangle of vines making
a wide detour and coming up behind the guard they
worked with the infinite patience of prisoners who have
a lifetime in which to burrow through a stone wall or
cut through a bar they drew nearer the grotto and
could hear the scales of the guard chattering as he
shifted his position presently they stopped finding
their way blocked by great logs piled up to form a wall

or crib they could see the guard now through the mass
of vines

  dana peered through the chinks in the log crib and
then stared at dutch in amazement

  look in there he whispered softly

  dutch put an eye to one of the chinks and stared
astonishment was written all over his pasty face

  a man he gasped one just like us

  dana tapped lightly on the log the man inside
listened staring about to find out where the sound came
from dana tapped again and put his lips to the chink
sh-h he hissed right over here-in back
the man who had been sitting in a dejected heap
straightened up and tiptoed eagerly to the back of the
crib

  who are you dana demanded in a soft whisper
never mind formalities now the man said eagerly
there is no time to lose-that is if you want to get
me out of here

  of course we do dana whispered but how can
we get by that guard

  you cant the man whispered listen carefully
they made the floor of this prison out of logs so i
couldnt burrow out but there is a weak place on the
right side if you could find a pole about four feet long
i could pry the logs apart and get out and whatever
you do dont make a noise

  they withdrew from the prison some distance and be-
gan cutting a pole whittling through the three-inch
stick with their pocket knives was arduous labor but at
last they had a serviceable pry pole they crept back
to the crude cell and passed the stick through the crack
to the stranger

  fine he whispered that is made to order ill
try to force the logs apart without making a noise but
you better come around to the right wall td give me
assistance in case of trouble

            chapter v
            the escape

dana and dutch crept around the side of the
building and waited they saw the end of the
pole protrude from the side and held their
breaths gradually the strain came on and one of the
logs moved ever so little again the man pried and
the log moved a little more once more he pried a little
harder this time the log moved slightly and then sud-
denly fell out of the wall and to the ground with a crash
of underbrush at the same time they heard the guard
rattling up to investigate

  hurry the man yelled help me through
together they grasped his arms and dragged him
through the narrow opening just as the monster entered
the door now the vines which had befriended them
became a menace before they could draw away from
the wall into the tangled brush the neptunian reached
a great scaly arm through the opening and grasped the
strangers arm in its huge four fingered claw they
heard the dull sickening snap of breaking bones

  run for your lives the stranger screamed with
pain and fright im lost-run

  the other plated arm was coming out of the prison
and grasping for dutch he tried frantically to force
his way through the vines but he had no time the
groping claw paused a moment as though the monster
inside were changing his position he had put his
eye to the chink

  dana stared for a moment too horrified to move he
drew himself together when he saw the monster arm
	wonder stories quarterly

again seeking dutch the ugly one-eyed face was
pressed close to the opening the yellow eye gleaming
with untterable hate that baleful glare was almost
hypnotic dana forced his gaze away from the hideous
stare and searched frantically for some weapon the
pole it was still leaning against the bottom of the
opening

  dana became all action in a moment he seized the
pole and jabbed it with terrific force into the glaring
yellow eye inches it went into the monsters head
grating and crunching there was a frightful bellow
from within the prison and the beasts hand relaxed its
hold upon the strangers arm it ran about blindly with-
ing the log house tearing down the logs in a wild con-
fusion

  quickly the three drew back into the jungle to escape
the heaving logs

  hurry gasped the man get into the open and
then run for a tunnel well have to get as far away
from here as we can-theyll come in a little while

  dutch and dana helped the injured man -through the
brush his broken arm dangled limply and impeded his
progress they gained the grotto and ran toward one
of the tunnels

  this one the stranger cried have to go this way
anyway

  they penetrated deep into the jungle and then bur-
rowed into the tangte beside the path they cleared a
space and lay down to rest

  we better set this arm said dana when they had
recovered their breaths

  they found both bones between the elbow and wrist
broken and ugly bruises where the monsters powerful
fingers had dug into the flesh they set the bones as
best they could and bound up the arm with splints and
strips of cloth torn from their shirts they fashioned a
sling from more of their ragged shirts as they worked
dana plied the patient with questions

  my name is dana manson he said we were
only exploring around

  the man winced and grinned at the same time

  i have heard of you he said i am dr gailman
of i suppose the ill-fated gailman-tumer expedition
the others of the party were eaten but the brutes were
saving me for some special occasion

  dr gailman then you have been here almost a
year dana was incredulous but we can talk about
that later what have you found out about these
monsters thats what we are eager to know

  dr gailman patted his bandaged arm gingerly
plenty to last me a long time he grinned they
arent animals in a sense they have a language and
superstitions just as we have although theirs are very
crude but i have never seen them so thoroughly
aroused as they were over the death of their king

  their king was that dead one their king

  yes as soon as they had eaten him and the new
king had crowned himself he ordered the tribe to scat-
ter throughout the jungle to find something or other-
i couldnt catch it-you see while i was penned up
there i listened to their bellowing and grunting until i
finally picked up a word it took me six months to get
that word after that i learned faster until i can under-
stand them fairly well i sometimes conversed with the
guard

  then it was the big boss we shot dutch said with
a heave of satisfaction

  shot dr gailman groaned no wonder they

were agitated now we are confronted by serious prob-
lems 

the chase

ti t et us hear some more about the monsters said
lj dana the more we know the easier itll be to
combat them what about that red light it puzzled
me

  that red light is a puzzle i have studied about it
for days at a time i fancy that it is a crystal which
becomes fluorescent when the violet light shines upon
it and glows with an induced light that is red that
is the only explanation i have ever come upoh at any
rate the natives are afraid of it and never go near it
when the king dies the new king is chosen by the simple
expedient of electing the one who is not afraid of the
light i suppose one of them believes that he is the one
and overcomes his fear i have come to the conclusion
that it is like an earthly big sword or big stick or crown
or other mark of authority or reverence when a man
has courage to grasp it he finds it harmless if he is still
superstitious he believes himself superior if not he
merely winks up his sleeve and dictates to the rest

  if we could get that red light we could rule the
place dana suggested

  wed be monarchs they would keep away from
our superior selves and take our orders like slaves but
the king took the light the old king used to leave it
stuck upright before his den but the new one probably
feels like carrying his new toy

i have noticed that there are no other animals on the
planet said dana i wonder how that happened

  i have wondered too i believe that these monsters
have eaten them all and are the sole survivors they
seem to be famished for meat and so eat their dead
they heard the clatter of scales and the faint bellow-
ing of the monsters there were answering bellows
the sound drew nearer dr gailman listened intently

  they are coming in answer to the call of the guard
he said presently now they will be upset

  they lapsed into silence as the monsters galloped by
they were drawing in from every direction pres-
ently they were assembled in the grotto and the three
fugitives could hear the new king giving orders while
others interrupted him

  they want to eat the dead guard and the king is
telling them that they will have to find us first said
gailman theyll search frantically until they find us
their appetite for meat is almost like the craving for
narcotics-im surprised that he dares deny them
again they heard the confusion of hundreds of the
monsters departing in chase through the tangled vines
the three men could see the approaching throng the
king holding his scepter above his head came first fol-
lowed by about seventy-five subjects evidently the
others had scattered throughout the maze of tunnels
presently the last of the kings troop had clattered by
and the din began to fade in the distance

  i have been wojidering about that violet light said
dana it seems to come out of the ground

  it does said gailman we landed on a large
clearing on the shore of a large lake north of here
there was a place where the steam was denser than
usual we stopped to investigate and found that it
came from almost pure radium i fancy that the ground
is full of it and that spot was an outcropping i have
come to the conclusion that the particles from the radium
induce a fluorescent condition in the soil that causes the
violet light
the monsters of neptune	

  radium radium- dana exclaimed and mused
listen-will a death ray affect the brutes

  no that is how we were captured we tried the
death ray but they came right on as if nothing had hap-
pened

  dana turned to dutch perhaps drisden saved our
lives by taking our good tubes and ammunition i bet-
ter not be too hard on him

  if you ever see him again dutch suggested

  but dana had relapsed into thought and did not hear
him he was trying to figure some means of controlling
the native forces if not put them to work he visioned
an outpost with valuable cargoes of radium being trans-
ported to the earth over the lines of his company he
pictured the revolutionary developments in the power
equipment of those on the earth

  but he groaned aloud we are stranded so theres
no chance

  whats that demanded gailman stranded not
if we can keep out of sight and if they have not dis-
covered my ship-and im sure that they havent when
we were captured the ship was rather effectively con-
cealed

dana almost hugged him you mean that your ship
may be in condition to fly  then we must go at once
the ship is probably in condition to fly but remember
that the natives are between us and the ship its up to
us to keep in condition to fly

toward the space ship

for days in this dayless land they crept through the
tunneled jungle occasionally they heard searchers
and were forced to abandon the tunnel and hide in the
tangled vines they were near the edge of the clearing
after one of dutchs sleeps when dana picked up
one of the scales which had dropped in the path it
was about ten inches in diameter and over two inches
thick he examined it carefully it was made up of
an oily substance intermixed with a hard flint-like
mineral evidently it was oily to turn the persistent
dripping water of the jungle he tried cutting it with
his pocket knife but found it too hard to yield more
than a fine shaving from the thin edge from this he
deduced that the oil penetrated entirely through

  this stuff would make a valuable source of oil he
suggested

  thats right said dutch anything to make more
shipping for your precious lines me-my worry comes
only three times a day

  dana shrugged but did not utter the retort that was
on the end of his tongue the fact that his companion
accused him of thinking of his air lines when he was
really thinking of terriana did not bother him

  the jungle was becoming thinner a few more miles
and they would be in the clearing they sat down to
rest

  we shall have to be very careful now said gail-
man there is no shelter in the clearing and if we are
seen we shall all perish

  dutch rolled a smoke lets stay here he said
settling himself comfortably this beats sitting around
in the pen

  dana snorted now i know youre crazy

  it all depends on how much you lose as i said be-
fore all i lose is a cot and a lot of steel scenery
they resumed their march and relapsed into silence
gradually the jungle thinned until concealment was dif-
ficult and they were forced to keep large trees in mind in
case one of the pursuers should come they crept along

more cautiously than ever they ran from tree to tree
pausing at each stop to listen for the clatter or bellow
of the chase at last they were at the edge of the tangle
of vines and peered cautiously out upon the barren hills

  a faint glow filtered throug from the clouds mixing
some normal light with the violet that came from the
ground making the effect less weird and gruesome than
in the dense jungle far in the distance they could see
the steam rising from the outcropping of radium
they listened carefully but heard nothing

  my ship is over in that steam said gailman the
clearing seems to be deserted-i suppose we might as
well make a dash for the craft

  if it would only get dark here we could wait until
night said dana

  but it wont said dutch lets go

  they broke away from the jungle running at an easy
trot that covered the ground rapidly and noiselessly
they skirted a low hill and felt safer when they had put
it between them and the jungle they rested in the
shelter for a few minutes and then continued winding
around the low hills

  how much farther do we have to go dana asked
after an hour of travel in the open

  we are about half way there said gailman the
river we crossed is about a fourth of the way as i re-
call there is a big heap of scales sort of a burying
ground for the scales and bones near the ship it is
almost as large as one of these hills watch for it
then well know where the ship is

  they continued their flight over the rough valleys
since crossing the river the ground had been rising
rapidly gradually the valleys became more shallow and
finally they found themselves on a plateau they looked
back it was as if the water had cut up the plateau into
numerous hills and valleys far behind they could see
the violet-white edge of the jungle dana suddenly
leaned forward and strained his eyes toward one of the
hilltops

  what is that he asked pointing out a hill about
half way between them and the jungle

trapped

they looked at the object silhouetted against the
leaden sky faintly they heard a blood-chilling
bellow and saw the statue move as they watched other
figures joined it until there were perhaps seventy-five
they could hear the bellowing voices and then the rattle
of scales as the band started in their direction they
saw others coming out of the jungle and taking up the
pursuit

  now well have to run dana shouted gailman
you lead the way since you know where to go

  swiftly they ran over the plateau perspiration stream-
ing down their faces while the clatter and bellowing
became louder and louder spurring them to frenzied
effort they sighted the pile of scales which was their
landmark just beyond they could see the great clouds
of steam from the radium outcropping presently gail-
man weakened from long confinement and his broken
arm began to lag

  you go on he gasped no use for all of us-to
die if i stay behind-theyll stop to eat me-and you
can -get away the ship is hidden-just inside that
column of steam

  no dana cried either we all go or we all stay
here dutch help and well give gailman a lift

  one ran at each side of the weary doctor and seized
the legs of his trousers assisting him along the race
	wonder stories quarterly

became a torture for dana and dutch burdened as they
were their lungs pained them as they sucked in great
sobs of stale air still the monsters gained

  we cant make it gailman groaned i command
you to abandon me that is the only way-to save your-
selves

  command-nothing dana gasped run a little
faster not far-to go

  they gained the pile of scales it formed a low hill
the accumulation of centuries the edge of the rising
column of steam was still half a mile in the distance
and the beasts were only a quarter of a mile behind them
gailman collapsed

  you must go on gailman choked in the interest
of science you have the key to the situation here you
know that they have a superstitious fear of red light
use it you must go and leave me theyll stop here
long enough for you to make it

  no said dana we all go or we all stay

  fool gailman almost sobbed cant you see that
that is your only chance and while we argue they come
it is better that i die than that all three of use be killed
go

  no why should you die instead of either of one
of us why shouldnt i stay here and you and dutch
go on

  the beasts were coming in great leaps their cries
tinged with a note of savage triumph swiftly they
covered the ground their powerful feet hammering the
damp rocky soil with jarring force their scales rattling
in unison already they had sped over half the inter-
vening distance the three watched the oncoming horde
helpless and fascinated as with the approach of a thun-
dering freight train a few minutes and they would be
ground out of existence in the lead ran the king hold-
ing his red-tipped scepter high in the air

  with a great effort dana tore his eyes away from the
scene that held him like a magnet

  if only i had that red light he thought with
flashing swiftness red light-red-

saved by red

with a savage jerk dana pulled dutch around and
out of his openmouthed fascination

  quick he shouted shave off some of the edge
of these scales-start a fire

  with trembling hands they opened their pocket knives
and cut little shavings from the thin edges of several
scales these they heaped up and dutch took out his
waterproof match box his fingers shook as he struck
a match and held it under the shavings a drop of
water from the ever dripping scales struck the tiny flame
it sputtered and went out

  theres only one match left dutch groaned you
light it

  dana became calm and steady in his desperation he
forgot the thundering horde he forgot their danger
he concentrated his every attention upon the tiny flame
he added the burned out match to the first to increase
the size of the fire he thrust the flame under the little
heap of shavings and carefully held it a tiny spurt of
red fire a frying sound and gradually the fire spread
throughout the heap of shavings a little thread of black
smoke rose from the tinder carefully he placed the
edges of scales over the fire and the oil burst into flame
he added others the fire became hot and boiled the
oil out of the scales they sputtered and shot blasts of
fire like tiny blow torches the flames spread rapidly to
other scales

  dana drew back suddenly he became conscious of
the thunder of the approaching horde he spun around
they were but a few hundred feet away on they
came the king bellowing orders and waving his scepter
the fire behind the fugitives was becoming a roaring
furnace of fierce oil

  at fifty feet the monsters hesitated for here was a
red light much larger than they had ever seen even
the king hesitated then he looked at his magic spark
of red crystal and came on again

  dana seized gailman and dutch

  up the heap he shouted

  they ran around the fire and climbed desperately up
the shifting scales they paused above the fire and be-
hind the screen of greasy black smoke

  you think its better to roast alive asked dutch in
amazement and terror

  the smoke shifted and they could see the king coming
at them straight into the blazing furnace he ran

  he thinks that he has overcome the superstitious
dread of anything that is red gailman shouted he
is shouting his greatness to the herd he thinks that he
is a super monster he is invincible now that he has
winked once

  but the king was bellowing in pain and surprise he
backed out of the fire but the damage was done his
scales were blazing lustily as he wove drunkenly toward
his astonished followers they drew back in awe and
terror the kings bellows became louder and more
agonized and then began to weaken he was drunk
with his new-found might the living torch staggered
a few more steps and then collapsed his own funeral
pyre

  in his wild contortions the king had dropped his
scepter dutch never greatly awed slid down the oily
scales and ran to the symbol of power he seized the
red crystal and waved it in the faces of the monsters
they drew back in obedience and respect dana and
gailman slid down the heap that they might watch him
better for the smoke and heat was now almost unbear-
able

  

  when dutch returned his eyes blazed with a new
light he had lost his almost bovine contentment in the
realization of new power

  say dana he said smiling are you going to
establish a post in this planet

  yes i feel now that i am justified in taking what-
ever money and power may come to me since i shall
revolutionize power and transportation on the earth as
soon as i get back to earth ill begin on a new and
greater organization

  fine said dutch i am going to stay here and
make these brutes feed me this beats sitting around in
a pen

  then ill put you in charge of the diggings here
dana laughed what shall i send for the project

  ill turn these boys into tractors and steam shovels
but ill need hand picks and shovels-and extra heavy
ones too better send a gun that shoots liquid fire in
case anyone gets it into his head that this crystal aint
magic and ill need a jail made of pretty heavy armor
plate in case any of my men think they can get out of
work and say dont forget to send matches and
smokes

  dana still trembling from the reaction wanted to
laugh hysterically but he controlled himself

  ill probably think of at least ten ship loads of stuff
he smiled but we must be on our way-so long

between earth and moon

by otfrid von hanstein

the author of electropolis whose complete novel appears in this issue of the quarterly
has recently completed a new book entitled between earth and moon which
is one of the most up-to-date and remarkable interplanetarian stories that has been published
to date

mr von hanstein not only has the literary ability to write a remarkable story but he is a
story teller of that kind who never allows you to become bored for a moment as in
electropolis the author has spun a tremendous tale of science mixed with thrilling
adventures that fairly take away your breath the story not only created a sensation in
germany where it was first published but it was cause for such a well-known scientist as
prof otto baschin the geographical authority and polar explorer of the university of
berlin to write the author the following letter

        my dear mr von hanstein

           i have read your novel between earth and moon -with great
       interest and i must must admit that it has kept me highly interested from begin-
       ning to end  admire the thoroughness with which you handled the various
       situations that required a tremendous amount of thought as well as the manner
       in which you handled the scientific parts of the story with your most remarkable
       imagination

               your book certainly should be the direct cause to interest everyone in space
          flying and to cause widespread discussion of the problems connected with space
          flying

i trust and wish you from the depth of my heart that this world rocket
flight will give occasion to create for you feme as enduring as jules vernes

                                                            most sincerely yours

                                                      o baschin

jvith six-foot strides the giants came bearing down on old zulerich they
were hideous things without brains without feeling without souls


the eternal man revives

a sequel to the eternal man

you will remember old zulerich who sat paralyzed
in his glass case because he had drunk his pale green
drops which he had discovered after a lifetime of
search for some chemical which could give eternal life

  you will remember also that after drinking them he
was entirely unable to move because he lacked the power
to drink a few drops of alkali which he had held in one
hand

  you will remember no one suspected him of being
alive but thought  had discovered
a marvelous embalming fluid which
had preserved in him a semblance
of life so he was put in a glass
case and displayed in the museum
while scientists studied him

  years and years passed over him
sitting in his glass case entirely un-
able to move even to raise an eye-
brow nor lift a finger but he grew
no older however with the years
there came a change in the manners
and moods of the human beings
who passed him every day as
they wandered curiously about the
museum

  sentiment warmed and grew so
that it had a great influence over
the minds and actions of the people

they became more and more easily
swayed by soft
gush of unthink-
ing folks they
became

up over old zule-
rich and demand-
ed that he be bur-
ied some of them
sobbed a bit over
what they called
the desecration of
an old mans dead
body

  the scientists
who controlled the
museum protested
at the maudlin
sentiment they
almost guessed
that zulerich was
still alive and
needed but some
secret potion to
revive him
though they had
be

  zulerich heard the whispers and speeches and discov-
ered that a movement was under way to have him bur-
ied naturally in his condition he became terrified for
he could not speak he could not move he could make
no protesting outcry at all he could only stare straight
before him and feel very much afraid

  as months passed the movement gained support zu-
lerich thought day and night trying to think of some way
to beg the leaders of the new movement to let him alone
but he could think of no way at all

  he stared at the cleaners as they washed down his
case with great dousing swabs of alkali water from their
sloshing pails a few drops of that liquid would release



him yet there was no more way to hint that he wanted
a drink of the suds

  terrifying hours he spent he listened fearfully to
every footstep which came down the narrow aisle he
watched every solemn face he feared every approach
every man in black seemed to him to be the undertaker
who would remove him from the brightly lighted mu-
seum and take him to the darkness of an eternal grave

  finally the hour came two men entered the room
briskly zulerich did not guess their
mission until they opened his case and
took him out the keeper of the mu-
seum watched wistfully and turned his
back upon them as they took him
down he felt their warm hands upon
him and they chilled him with terror

  after he had been put in the ambu-
lance and driven away to the morgue
he was placed in a cheap steel casket
and rumbled out to the cemetery
fright grew in his kindly old soul as
he felt them remove his box and sink
it into the earth then he heard the
sullen fall of spaded earth

  every nerve was taut and strained
trying to command his voice to cry
out yet not a whisper left his lips
he tried to rise to pound a hand
against the lid but he could not make
the slightest move
the thudding be-
came fainter and
fainter until black
silence crept in to
keep him com-
pany silence rang
in his ears dark-
ness spread hke a
great void all
about

what the rain
did

so he lay day
on day night
on night and both
were tie same in
that black grave
and he grew used
to the darkness
and the silence
and his thoughts
quieted and ripened as old wine in a dark place he be-
came very wise in meditating upon things that he had
observed while upon the earth

  his thoughts were of bright sunshine upon bright
flowers and of the warm moist earth at springtime when
buried seeds burst their prison to send up their shoots
seeds that were so like him seemingly dead but with
eternal life prisoned in them

  he recalled poems and scanned them line by line to
dwell upon their beauty and mull upon their thought he
reasoned out theories he pondered upon facts he
dreamed dreams then when he could think of nothing
new at all he would begin all over and retrace his thought
again over and over his fancy circled the unending
memory of old days and wove into them new imaginings

d d sharp

 to those who read and enjoyed the eternal man
 which appeared in the august  issue of science
 wonder stories we offer a further treat in the
 present sequel mr sharp offers so much that is inter-
 esting exciting and yet food for thought that it is diffi-
 cult to know how to speak of his story there is no doubt
 that he points out a new road in science fiction-for his
 stories are witty yet sad deep and yet simple and pos-
 sessed of a poetry of feeling that cannot help but carry
 the reader away

   there is no doubt but that most people long for eternal
 life and fear death more than anything else yet as our
 author so convincingly points out eternal life might not
 be altogether a blessing and before we can ask for it
 we must prove that we are worthy of it if men such as
 the rulers that mr sharp pictures were given eternal
 life certainly they themselves would weary of it and the
 people they rule would feel it an intolerable curse we
 would like our readers opinions on this question

no idea what that potion might

still black silent night held reign

  eternity is a long time and much can happen in it

  even the steel box in which old zulerich lay rusted
and grew weak and thin there came the rains of the
great wet years water trickled into the sod and found
the mouldy cavity where rusted the steel box a tiny
leak came through a rusted hole in the casket lid and
water dripped upon his forehead all night all night or
all day he could not tell which for day was as night
in that grave

  on and on the drip continued tap tap tap tap like
the tick of a clock almost run down it broke in a new
place and dripped upon his chest his limbs and finally
into his upturned mouth his nerves were tortured with
the constant drip of it he tried to move just a little
he wanted to let the splatter of it fall in a new place
he tried to move though he knew from experience that
he could not

  but he did move  after more than a hundred years
of stiff hypnosis he moved he stretched his legs he
closed his muddy wide open eyes and then he fought
furiously to get out

  the drip through the gypsum clay had carried in it
the small amount of alkali he needed to get back the use
of his muscles

  squirming about against the steel lid it ripped loose
and a strip of it broke off in his hand with that as a
spade it did not take long for him to work his way out
and poke his grizzled half bald head into the gray light
of a rainy day he crawled naked into the fresh sweet
rain for his clothes were as ash and had fallen from
him as he worked his way out

  out on the top of the earth again he had not dared
dream of it as he lay paralyzed with earth spaded upon
him such a miracle had not occurred to him at all

  he smelled the moist clean freshness of a rainwashed
earth the fragrance of new blossoming flowers the
sweet meadows which spread green and luscious all about
him

  the pain and misery of his long dark wait below was
behind him it was forgotten in his joy at being above
the earth again able to move again he was in a new
century and the scientist in him was alert as he hurried
down from the top of the little hill where he had been
buried he wondered what he should find in the old
town had mankind advanced had they continued
with the unparallelled progress he had witnessed dur-
ing the twentieth century or had that been merely a
mushroom growth already decayed he hurried down
to see

  if population was any answer man had certainly
progressed for the old home town had swelled out be-
yond the old forested hills and it seemed to have been
remade it glowed with a white beauty undulled even
by the dreary day light glowed from every wall and
tower soft and radiant like the glow of a firefly the
whole city seemed painted with some luminous enamel
which glowed more brightly with the passing of dark
clouds and dimmed with the rifting of them

  there were no streets as he knew them in the old
days instead there were crescents and stars and circles
landscaped off for the setting of stately buildings many
people were about but they were high in the air trav-
elling here and there very rapidly in small planes which
were of a peculiar butterfly pattern they were tinted
and exquisitely lighted

  zulerich dared not enter the city for he was naked
still those above seemed not to notice him at all as he
crouched behind a statue of white marble

  finally a plane dropped vertically from the sky he
drew away expecting to see it dashed upon the base of
the statue near which he crouched but as it dived to-
ward the earth the beautiful butterfly wings began to
revolve around and around and it came ddwn as lightly
as a bird upon a twig

  a man crawled from the plane and stared at zulerich
in astonishment

  what are you doing out here naked old man he
asked

zulerich was staring a bit himself studying every
feature of man and plane so this was a product
of the twenty-third or twenty-fourth century zule-
richs interest was alive as to what change had taken
place in man and mechanics since his time on earth

  the man seemed rather more feminine than men were
used to be soft delicate features slim perfectly cared
for hands low well controlled voice the plane was
seemingly made to please the eye as well as to be of serv-
ice

  where did you come from the man asked seem-
ingly piqued by zulerichs close observation

  i dug myself from my grave zulerich answered
knowing the surprise he must awake my box rusted
from me and i dug through the wet clay

  the man frowned zulerich shook a little in the drizzle
of chill rain

  the mans tone changed when he spoke again it
became indulgent

  sure sure he said consolingly but who are your
folks old man

  there must be none alive zulerich answered with
nostalgia in his tone there will be no one i am sure
none who know me for i have been buried for so long
a time i had no way to number the years but i must
have lain there in the grave for centuries still you
may have a written remembrance of me for i was a
great marvel in my day i found the compound which
would perpetuate body cells the pale green drops of
eternal life

  sure sure the man said indulgently but where is
your home with whom do you stay i will take you
there cant you remember where you live

  i am not insane sir zulerich said looking the man
straight in the eye the story i tell is strange but i
can prove the most marvelous part of what i saw i still
remember my formula and i can give any man who
drinks of it eternal life

  you dont expect me to believe that

  yes

  old man youre crazy as a bolo youd better let
me take you home or else go there yourself get on
some clothes you must know its been a hundred years
since people were allowed naked in the streets the
new rule wont stand for naked men you ought to know
that

  i know nothing of your rule son i have just come
out of the grave i have not seen the good light of gods
day since the year of our lord twenty hundred and
thirty-nine

  you act well the man admitted you have taken
on the old form of speech you dare walk naked in the
street and you hint that you reckon time by the old ju-
lian calendar which had been in disuse for more than a
hundred years you act too well to be entirely insane
the man stared straight into old zulerichs clear eyes his
face lighted as he seemed to arrive at a conclusion
prove that you can give one eternal life by all the truth
the eternal man revives

of science it will open a place for us both in the cham-
ber of the rulers

  give me some clothes zulerich demanded take me
where we can talk and allow me yet a little time so that
i may see that man is ready for them and i will give to
every one that wishes the pale green drops which will
cause him to never die

  the man turned and opened the tinseled door of the
little plane

  come he decided ill give you clothes id do
that much for anyone not that i believe a thing you
say not a bit of it

  i will prove what i say zulerich affirmed i will
give my secret freely to you and all the people i have
always loved them felt a deep pity for them all sor-
rowed at the waste death laid upon their lives regretted
that when man was just learning how to live it was or-
dained as time that he should die the earth is already
filled with a new race they seem to have the secret of
perfect health and luxurious life i will add the last
and greatest gift they shall have time to work into
their years the pattern of their dreams they shall
never know again the fear of death

   into the mans face crept a glowing avidity zulerich
knew it was a hunger of eternal life a desire to outwit
eternal death

  god the man whispered if you were only not
crazy after all 

  he stared in dumb silence as though the possibilities
of such a dream were too much for speech

  there came a measured rumbling tread fromsome-
where below the earth the man drew rigidly erect
and stared about he grabbed eulerich by the arm

  get in he urged the telecops must not sense you
they would have you before the rulers

  zulerich slid his naked body into the seat and sank
into soft satin cushions against the far door there were
many strange switches and lights and knobs he did not
understand certainly the age of mechanics seemed
perfect

  the man slid in beside him the butterfly wings be-
gan to whirl around and around over the cab and sucked
the plane straight into the sky far above the city the
wings ceased whirling and the propeller ahead began to
roar the wings spread rigidly from each side of the
fuselage and they sped away much as planes had when
zulerich lived before upon the earth

  it would take volumes to recount half of the mechan-
ical marvels zulerich saw in that one city it seemed to
him the world had become an aladdins lamp where the
slightest touch yielded the greatest desires there was
one thing he remarked more than all the others and
that was this though all work that man desired was
done through power broadcast by radio over the whole
city not one smoking chimney told of a power house
not one river was harnessed and not one gasoline engine
sputtered in plane or factory zulerich asked his com-
panion about this and he told him that man had long
ago learned to use energy from the great source itself
the sun furnished all power through a series of inten-
sifiers which caught the sunlight and brought it into
one startling blaze of incandescent heat this beam was
shot downward like a searchlight to the engines which
ran all day and stored power for the night on occa-
sions power could be transmitted by radio from stations
with a surplus to those that needed it power could even
be drawn from the other side of the earth should it be
required



             chapter ii
             a new world

 the mans name proved to be rhuh which in ac-
 cordance with the new system of naming men gave
 his vocation his race his town and his standing in
 the community

   rhuh took zulerich to his home and gave him clothes
 he was invited to dinner and being very hungry and
 without an idea where else to obtain food zulerich
 accepted

   the meal was almost wholly of synthetic foods manu-
 factured so rhuh stated from sunlight gases and min-
 erals without recourse to the slow growth of plant life

 there were also fresh figs from smyrna grapes from
 california and a new tartly flavored fruit from southern
 texas zulerich had seen no railways nor freight planes
 and expressed a wonder how these fruits had come so
 fresh from so long a distance rhuh explained all food
 and other freight was sent into the cities through great
 tubes where compressed air shot the containers along at
 the rate of hundreds of miles an hour

   the cities are much overcrowded rhuh complained
 men pile upon each other like bees in a swarm there
 has been no war for two hundred years and no pestilence
 in more than half a century there are no longer guns
 or spears or lethal weapons of any kind there are not
 even sporting arms for there has been no wild game for
 generations the few animals left alive are in zoos or
 laboratories meat as diet is looked upon as barbaric

   rhuh made a pellet of a wax-like substance and rolled
 it toyingly between his finger and thumb then dropped
 it into a little bronze vessel where glowed a jet of purple
 flame immediately there came an aroma which filled
 the whole room the smell was rather heady but pleas-
 ant

   carteesh rhuh explained it has become a na-
 tional habit much as cigar and cigarette smoking in other
 days

   rather nice smelling stuff zulerich commented

   they sat breathing the peculiar incense relaxed day
 dreaming finally zulerich asked

   is the whole earth so over populated as this city
 seems to be

   rhuh drew himself from his fancies snapped a switch
 and pointed toward what before had been a tall white
 wall now it seemed a large window looking out upon
 an untamed jungle he touched another switch the
 jungle seemed to flow back like fields beyond the window
 of a railway coach zulerich leaped to his feet it seemed
 the whole house was in motion flowing over a tropical
 jungle he sat down again slightly embarrassed smiled
 and watched

   television i suppose he commented

   rhuh nodded and said the foibles of human nature
 have always puzzled me but here is one which exceeds
 all the rest for lack of explanation men are packed in
 our cities until the subways are cleared by oxygenized air
 and yet the most fertile and picturesque sections of our
 globe are totally uninhabited this would not seem
 queer were transportation a matter of discomfort
 there is absolutely no reason why we should pack up
 in certain spots as though there was no standing room
 anywhere else yet we do and were it not for our
 excellent medical service and our very efficient telecops
 we would be exterminated by our own gregariousness

   but surely zulerich exclaimed pointing to the in-
 tense tropical growth there are animals in those
 forests
	wonder stories quarterly

  rhuh twisted the little brass knob under his fingers
the forest seemed to rush closer until the long palmlike
foliage spread thick and jumbled before them the
tropics were there for all zulerich could tell dense
luxuriant and still he peered into the undergrowth and
scrutinized the foliage and tree trunks as they passed
very slowly now he could not find a bug nor a bird
an animal nor a snake

  why he asked

  it was not always that men were lazy as they are
now there was a time nearly a century ago when
everyone male and female vied with others in activity of
brain and body at that time scientists had learned that
disease was due almost entirely to parasitic life and
parasitic life was fostered mainly by the lower animals
that was the age of gas the age of electricity had just
passed and men having exhausted its resources were
turning to gas for study and accomplishment new
gases were found almost daily and new uses for gases
gas carried men about composed more than half their
foods heated them cooled their cities and their foods
healed them and entertained them

  acting upon the common impulse to rid life of
disease a great student of gas discovered tertopelium
it was brought from far above the earth by suction to
the cylinders and forced into tanks by compression it
is still the lightest known gas being found high above
the earths atmosphere this student found that terto-
pelium would destroy all lower animal and microscopic
life but would not harm man at all i believe even as
far back as the twentieth century of the old julian
calendar chemists had discovered powders that were
poisonous to insects but entirely harmless to man

  not to bore you with details tertopelium was con-
densed and mixed with a heavier gas to give it weight
then the entire surface of the earth was flooded with it
from planes since that time there has been no parasitic
nor animal life in our forests tertopelium made a very
efficient job whether nature will evolve the like again
can not be proved nor even guessed for a good many
thousands of years

the telecops

while the topic of conversation was life and death
zulerich asked rhuh what ideas prevailed as to
the ultimate future it seemed that man had abandoned
hope of eternal life upon this planet or any other though
the very fact that progress had always been toward per-
fection should have strengthened rather than weakened
faith in future life and because of this doubt as to
life beyond the grave rhuh was all the more eager to
prove the hope zulerich now dangled before him

  but as zulerich questioned and studied he was not
so enthusiastic about his promise to give life to the
people he was a man of deep faith he knew that
faith had fostered and mothered every accomplishment
and he doubted the wisdom of giving men eternal life
when they had no faith and no vision so he talked on
letting his mind run along one channel and his words
another

  he told how he had discovered the secret of the
mangled rat which had so upset him with the pain in its
eyes and of the scientists who had studied him and of
the sentiment which had buried him and rhuh in turn
told of many new and incredible marvels which zulerich
had never thought to be possible rhuh finally seemed
convinced that after all he was talking with a very old
and very remarkable man and admitted that he really
believed that zulerich might have discovered the elixir

of life for in those days there were so many new and
wonderful things men had long since ceased to hoot at
anything

  zulerich commended the spirit of progress so evident
all about but rhuh did not seem to possess any of his
enthusiasm

  yes he admitted we have made incredible progress
over the old age of invention of two hundred and more
years ago there is no need now that anyone should be
in want or be denied the luxuries of life

  but in the days that followed zulerich found that the
masses were in want the rulers had become insane
with power and ridden with a lust for accumulation of
wealth they took with a bold and greedy hand for
they no longer feared any uprising of the people nor any
embezzlement by employees the telecops which guarded
their treasure and maintained their power were strictly
mechanical and operated by a secret code that was known
only to the owners political and social relations had in
no wise kept pace with the progress of mechanical inven-
tion all advancement had been material politicians
openly abused their government humility charity
idealism self-sacrifice these were traits unknown love
had a new definition and the new life beneath its
mechanical perfection was a hollow thing

  so zulerich told rhuh finally that he would not give
the secret of life to the people nor to any one until
some semblance of justice was done man to man

  rhuh stared at him for a moment with the corners
of his mouth drawn awry then he grasped his arm and
snarled

  old man you make good if youve been lying to

me dangling a hope before me that is a hoax if--

his lips twitched and jerked but no sound passed them
for a while he was too angry and disappointed to com-
plete his threat instead he jabbed at a button beside
the table

  there came a hum above the house a big plane
dropped past the window zulerich looked out as it
landed light as a bird upon a twig its door opened
thrfe grotesque imitations of men got out they were
giant fellows they must have been ten feet tall with
angular arms as thick as a mans thigh and legs as
large in proportion as the arms they walked forward
with a stiff mechanical lock step they reached the door
wheeled in perfect unison and came tramping in bowing
their heads to clear the doors the whole inside of the
house reverberated with the pulse of their measured
tread they filed in and zulerich shrank involuntarily
from them as they marched to where he sat

  their heads were not round but box-like and to
make them more horrible they were fitted with great
glass eyes which stared at one with wide greenish pupils
as through they were dead of course they could not
see for they were not live things just mechanical police
but zulerich learned later that they sensed a man or an
object by the shadow thrown upon their eyes this oper-
ated an electrical device which guided them in the back
of each steel body was a hinged door which looked to
be a way of entering the mechanical chamber to mend
any defects

  one of the telecops stood back at the door the other
two advanced and zulerich sat as stiffly as he had
done in his glass case wondering what they were about
to do to him

  long stiff arms reached out with three jerky moves
and seized him with hard iron fingers

  we arrest you in the name of the rulers come

before the rulers

zulerich had thought the silent oncoming tele-
cops were terrible enough but that mechanical voice
had an impersonal tone which gave him a feeling of the
utter futility of protesting or begging for consideration
he abandoned hope and made no resistance he knew
any protest or defence would be useless he rose and
followed the man who had seized his arms running to
keep up but in spite of all he could do he could not
keep pace with the long legs of the mechanical giant
and was dragged towards the plane

  he passed rhuh at the door there was no pity nor
leniency in the glare rhuh gave him

  he was taken out and placed in the rear cab of the
large plane it was indeed a large plane in comparison
with the small ones which flew all about under its
wings and upon its fuselage was the triangle insignia
of the police

  they rose into the air through the glass of the cab
he could see a real man at the wheel the three telecops
rode in the rear cab with him

  a thousand feet above the city their course was set
toward the east they traveled all day and a short while
before dark they came to a very large city which was
the capital of the world there he was placed in prison
the prison showed none of the advancement of the day
for the rulers had little or no consideration for those
who fell into their hands the next day he was brought
to trial

  rhuh appeared against him testifying that zulerich
had told him of a secret elixir of eternal life and had
promised it to him for a suit of clothes and that zulerich
had taken the clothes but had not disclosed the secret

  the judge of the court was indignant that such a
case should be brought before him he dismissed zule-
rich and lectured rhuh for believing in such foolishness
but later in the night the judge sought out zulerich and
talked with him and tried to bargain for a portion of
the pale green drops

  zulerich was amazed at the cringing attitude of the
judge and said

  you ridicule me in your court yet you seek me in
the night judges of even my day would not be so bold
as this

  so he refused to bargain with him and was called
before a council of the high rulers they made much
over him at first inviting him to the palace as though
he were a guest they engaged him with sly questions
and finally prepared a feast for him every one of the
council of ten was there

  he was a little awed as he ate and drank with them
for zulerich had always been an humble man investi-
gating for the sake of truth and not coveting honor

  when the feast was over every man sat a while in
silence and watched him closely zulerich felt somewhat
uncomfortable under their scrutiny and sat in silence
wondering just vshat their gravity could mean

one of them finally asked has there been time

  a short dark man with a vandyke who had watched
zulerich even more closely and more carefully than the
rest of them nodded soberly then he turned to those
about the table and said

  there is something strange about this man zulerich
he drank the poison each of you saw me pour it into
his glass yet he seems entirely unharmed

  do you think he is as he claims the chairman
asked

i do not know the vandyke answered shaking his

knotty head by all law of nature this man should be
dead yet we must admit he lives 

   zulerich grew bolder then they had tested the truth
of his claim and had about become convinced i have
the secret of eternal life he vowed and i am one who
loves his fellow man when you shall do justice and
be content one man to rule himself rather than another
i will give it freely to you and to all the people

   they laughed at his speech calling him sentimental
and impractical and when their ridicule had no effect
they began to bargain with him for the secret but
zulerich in turn laughed at them deriding them for
offering so little for so great a thing as the secret of
immortality

   finding they had made no headway they reduced their
demands to one portion for each of the rulers but
zulerich shook his grizzled old head and muttered

   you are not fit for eternal life

   we are nearly perfect the chairman insisted we
lack but this one thing we have subdued the earth
we have mastered all natural law except this law of
life and death men and nature serve us we will give
you a place in our authority allow you to share equally
in our power though we have bought this good thing
with daring and danger and you have risked nothing
at all give us so that we may live always and we
will give you power over the earth

  still zulerich shook his head and speaking to the
chairman of the council he said sternly your lack is
greater than you know

  the trace of a fine sneer touched the chairmans
lips and he asked what is it old man that we lack
except this secret of life and death 

  imagination zulerich said slowly dwelling upon
each syllable you can not think beyond your own
selves

chapter iii

zulerich relents

the chairman pointed a long white finger at him
and said acridly i have no patience with your
chatter we offer no more bargains we will have
the secret out of you old man

  at the right of the chairman sat a big bullnecked
blonde man of about forty he shouted so that his bel-
lowing voice filled the hall that is what i wanted to
do at first

  have the old dodderers secret from him or give
him the garrotte

  checkmate gentlemen  the vandyke objected if
this old man really has the secret of eternal life he can
not die we are frustrated by the very thing we most
desire

  a bushy black-eyed man beside zulerich reached
over and grasped the scientists ear he gave it a violent
twist

   zulerich winced involuntarily with pain

  the bushy man chuckled and spoke in a deep bass
gentlemen i have shown you a way torture him
he can still feel pain

  the whole council smiled with relief the bullneck
blonde shouted boisterously have it out of him

   the chairman said very quietly come old man give
us the secret or youll have a mangled body to drag
about

  zulerich shuddered for the moment he wished he
had never clawed himself from his peaceful grave he
was a conscientious man and would rather have endured


wonder stories quarterly

that everlasting night than to give these brutal men
eyerlasting life in which to exploit the earth he re-
membered the mangled rat -the fiery pain in its eyes
he knew wherever it was then it still endured the pain
of the blow it liad received that day at the museum
more than two hundred years before if they mangled
him he would carry it into the eternal years ahead he
did not feel that he could submit to it and yet he knew
also that death was the only enemy these tyrants feared
death alone could conquer them and raise up new
rulers with kinder hearts should he reveal to them his
secret he would betray all men forever into their
power still he felt he could not submit to eternal pain
it was too great a price to pay for other peoples
comfort

   the chairman called out something in a peculiar
 tongue

   there came a measured tramping from outside the
 hall the whole palace seemed to throb with the sound
 of it the telecops were coming he would be given
 over to them that they might mangle him

   the great oaken doors at the end of the hall swung
 back zulerich hitched upward from his chair as the
 square-headed giants with their set hideous eyes came
 marching through with a measured precision which
 shook the tiled floor no one paid him any attention
 they were smiling with certitude as to what should
 transpire

   with six-foot strides the giants came bearing down
 upon old zulerich who stood erect and determined to
  meet his fate bravely they were hideous things men

 	without brains without feeling without souls they
 were more dreadful than a firing squad or an army
 with set bayonets

   iron hands reached to grasp him iron fingers clutched
 his arms iron arms raised him from the floor the
 giants whirled and struck off toward the still open
 doors

   wait zulerich begged turning his big eyes upon
 the chairman of the council give me a minute i
 relent i will give you each a portion of the secret drug 

   the chairman gave a sharp command in a peculiar
 tongue the iron fingers held him but the telecops halted
 and stood at attention

   i will give you each a portion that will give to you
 eternal life zulerich repeated stop this horrible pro-
 cedure

   very well the chairman answered but do not
 play with us or attempt any sly schemes

   another command was given and zulerich was let
 to the floor but still surrounded by the mechanical
 giants

   have five bottles brought to me together with the
 quantity of each chemical that i shall write down i
 will then mix them in my secret proportions and from
 the brew i will give each of you a vial of this solution
 and a vial for each of the governors of the provinces
 of the world this you must take at the first peep of
 the sun on the first day of the week following the new
 year then you shall have eternal life

   the rulers were in great spirits but one more cau-
 tion suggested that they put upon his pulse a new ma-
 chine which could defect by the quiver of red ink lines
 upon its tape whether a man lied or spoke the truth

   so they brought the lie detector and put its band upon
 his arm and its finger upon his pulse and then they
 asked him again

   will the secret portion which you shall give us render

 unto us eternal life if we take it in the manner you
 have said	r

   yes it will certainly give you eternal life zulerich
answered and as they looked at the register upon the
tape they agreed that he had spoken the truth

chaos

so they brought him the chemicals and the bottles
were put in the laboratory they furnished him and
when he had mixed the solution and bottled it he gave
it to the rulers who sent vials to each ruler of the
provinces throughout the world retaining a large por-
tion for themselves and their friends and families

  so it happened that on the peep of the sun on the
first day of the week following the new year all the
rulers and their friends and families throughout the
whole world drank of the pale green drops and sat
or stood or lay in whatever position they were when
they drank their drops for like zulerich when he first
drank the pale green drops they lived but they were
entirely unable to move

   but then zulerich entirely lost his head in his joy over
his success now that the tyrants were helpless and
deposed he should have been wise enough to gradually
release control to the masses instead he published
broadcast the news and proclaimed that all men should
take the rewards of their own labor and live peacefully
with one another he invited them to drink of his pale
green drops of eternal life and promised them additional
drops which would give freedom of movemenl

  the people were quick to claim control of affairs but
they were afraid of him and his drops which had stricken
their rulers in such a perplexing way even rhuh who
had followed zulerich to the palace eyed him with a
new awe and would not drink of the drops he had tried
so hard to obtain

  tilings rocked along in this way a few months zule-
rich having no other home stayed in the palace and
rhuh curious as to what the scientist was about stayed
to watch him

  some of the stronger labor societies and more intelli-
gent men and women met in the courts and organized
a new republic somewhat on the order of the old united
states of america people everywhere hailed the united
states of the world as a utopia which was to fill every
need nd wish but they leaned upon it too heavily and
it gave way even in an age of perfected mechanics
they learned that ones government depends a good deal
upon what he put into it himself

  riots started in the assembly rooms and spread from
city to city men fought in the plazas and the dis-
turbance was quickly scattered over the whole earth
there was soon no safety nor peace in any city of the
whole world

  anarchy followed industries became idle through
lack of labor and fear of pillage the fighting was
savage tooth and fist cudgel and stone with fire to
anything that would take flame

  soft cultured men suddenly slipped their veneer and
became wolves of rage and fear weakened by a life of
mechanical efficiency they had not fighting strength
yet they were as fiercely bloodthirsty as any of their
savage forebears	

  zulerich heard with growing sadness the tales rhuh
brought to the palace works of art chemical formulae
that had been perfected by a lifetime of patient experi-
ment machinery which had been constructed with years
of tireless labor were being mutilated and destroyed
the eternal man revives



men had gone mad with too much freedom they had
no control over themselves they had been too long
dependent upon stronger wills than their own and
zulerich became wiser through his second great mistake
he knew that he had overthrown one evil and spread
a greater one he found out most certainly that any
government no matter how despotic or rotten it might
be was far better than no government at all

  he faced a new problem he mulled over it as the
progress of a thousand years was being pushed back-
ward into oblivion

  should he revive the tyrants should he return the
selfish despots to power should he allow them again
to take control and grind the people forever now that
they would have eternal life

  before he reached the solution to these questions
rhuh betrayed his hiding place to the people zulerich
did not learn of this until it was too late for him to run
if he had wanted to do so the first idea he had that
the mob wanted to kill him was the drone of their planes
above the palace he could not believe they would hate
him because he had taken away their rulers from them

  he peered from the palace door as he heard the noise
of planes and raised voices the sky was swarming with
the small highly colored planes every landing place
in the park was crowded with them one lighted on
top of another men leaped from them to pack the court
they pushed forward toward the palace storming it
with sheer force of numbers they were in a frenzy
and seemed to acknowledge no leader

rebellion

zulerich stood alone there were no soldiers no
police the telecops which guarded the palace were
useless to him but he was courageous with self-forget-
ting superiority which ignored the menace all about him
his one thought was of right and reconstruction of
stopping the senseless destruction

  he pushed open the big glazed doors which opened
from the vestibule upon the outside steps hoping with
words of reason and a calm bearing to shame the crowd
and give them a new vision

  but these restless men below him were not to be
shamed by self-sacrifice and heroism they were used
only to obedience to iron wills they respected nothing
but the law of stronger forces they had no code no
standard except the desire to get while the getting was
good

  they charged up the broad sweeping steps which
spread a marble cascade below the doors he felt the
passion of their clawing hands the hoarse bellow of
their hate and lust saw their dancing bloodshot eyes
as they hissed and snarled

  the fury of it swelled until the very walls of the
palace seemed shaken the contagion passed from court
to court it seethed and boiled over to spread out through
the city

  the sound and sight of such babel almost drained
old zulerichs resolves but he stood his ground for
a moment daring them to be as brave and sane as he
stopped them in a semicircle of hesitating wrath like
beasts crouching before awhip he might have reasoned
with them then might have brought them to themselves
and a knowledge of their senseless mania but a sound
grew behind the palace walls as silence spread before
the palace steps

new howls now had the swelling throb of unrestrained

passion the chilling thrill of unreasoning lust the ter-
rifying swing of irresistible force

  zulerich had heard that cry of rebellion before it had
chilled him then to think of what the sleeping giant of
revolt could do if he awoke and it was awake now

  the swelling rhythm surged and grew pulse on pulse
throb on throb wave on wave he turned and ran who
could reason with this insanity terror had hold of the
earth

  he plunged headlong down the palace hall stopping
only to shut and lock the big oak doors he reached the
marble stairs and took them with his long agile leaps
he passed rank on rank of rigid telecops as they stood
at stiff mechanical attention against the wall he passed
rigid paralyzed rulers where they stood or sat or lay
their motionless eyes staring straight before them those
eyes sickened him as they burned on him with life he
knew what fear clutched those one-time fearless despots
as they lay helpless and cringed before the trampling
mob which howled down upon them

  but he had no time for pity palace doors were being
splintered furnishings wrecked and borne down as men
clawed and crushed each other and beat across the tile
with the drum of angry feet while over all the palace
swelled the rhythm of tramping feet

  fools fools zulerich sobbed as he leaped ahead
fools he shouted as he reached the next floor you
are pulling down your own protection why must you
always destroy that which you do not understand

  but his words were as useless as the line of tall
telecops which stood with infinite patience against the
palace walls the masses were as ignorant of controlling
themselves as he was of controlling the telecops there
stood the iron soldiers who knew only how to obey
they were the perfect soldier without initiative or fear
waiting only the proper word but he did not know how
to command

chapter iv

flame and fire

the masses piled into the halls like medieval peas-
ants storming a castle there were no firearms
men wielded sticks chairs missiles any weapon
they could find

  zulerich ran swiftly and with endurance the pale
green drops had restored the agility of his early youth
but there was no escape men already were upon the
stairs and swarming from the elevators overhead he
was surrounded there was no way past them at all
hoarse bellows which cried for his destruction rose
above the incessant howl he made aturn about the
second floor and took the next flight of stairs

  at the third floor men were also swarming he turned
down the hall toward the end of the building expansive
windows made up most of the outer walls through
these zulerich saw a flash of the dreaded heat ray it
whipped here and there over the city like the blade of a
great searchlight the brightness of it was such that it
cut daylight as an electric torch does night it raked the
city found the palace and shot a broad blade of incan-
descence through the windows and down the hall fire
burst from it and furnishings flamed as paper thrown
into an electric furnace it had no billowy roaring flame
which trailed lurid clouds of smoke it was a quiet
intense heat which blinded him and burned down the
struggling men with the suddenness of an explosion
a frightful sight that blazing tongue consuming and

leaving but ash of everything combustible it cracked
the white marble walls and left them a red blaze of
heat it ate woodwork like an acid which spread

  down in the lower floors of the palace rose shrieks
and moans as the flashes leaped from top to bottom of
the big palace zulerich darted into a nearby vault
stricken and almost overcome he know what had hap-
pened the sun-reflectors of the municipal towers were
turned upon the palace the mob inside was attacked
by men of different political beliefs

  zulerich lay panting in the open vault for he had
fallen exhausted upon the floor burned by the reflection
of the flashes against the wall as the blade swirled
about like the flash of an ancient searchlight he saw
it strike downward into the court came cries and
panic but the destruction went on shrieks drowned it
now and then but it did not die it rose again and
again with new and lusty vigor as men crowded into
the ashes of those just burned

  though it was bright day outside the vault the hall
seemed dim and hazy much as a room will after one
has stared into the naked sun zulerich got up and
stumbled out the door determined to leave the palace
and escape to some far land there he might possibly
gather around him a little band of men to organize a
government of sanity and restraint

  he stumbled over something near the door inside of
the vault the glaring search of the sunfire came swing-
ing up the palace walls again and gave him a fleeting
glimpse of what lay there

  it was the man in the vandyke beard one of the
rulers were still alive

  zulerich stooped and shook him shouting

  wake up man wake up the palace is aflame

  he had forgotten the man could not move that he
was one of the tyrants who had tried to worm the secret
of eternal life from him but when the man did not
move and stared up at him with fire in his eyes and
his body rigid as though frozen he remembered that
vandyke had drunk of his pale green drops and he
remembered too that he must know the code which
worked the telecops that all he lacked was a few drops
of alkali to give him speech and movement if he could
only get down to the basement where he had his vials of
alkali he could revive this man and bring about order
out of chaos the invulnerable police which once had
stricken fear into the hearts of the people could again
be about their jobs

  he picked up vandyke in his arms and ran out into
the hall even as he ran hurriedly for the lower floors
he noticed that the telecops were as good as ever despite
the terrific heat which had been thrown upon them they
were evidently made to stand intense heat as well as
any other mode of attack but the vials of alkali were
not for zulerich just then they were far below and
he could hear men already crowding back into the palace
singing their dread song of rebellion

  the glare of the diabolical heat ray came traveling
back again zulerich had reached the stairs and stumbled
down them falling heavily upon the landing where a
fountain spurted a jet of water and steam from its
cracked and blistered marble base the glare grew swift-
ly the heat ray was sweeping upon him like an ancient
machine gun seeking out a nest he twisted about and
pulled himself from under the helpless man in his arms
who had fallen across his thighs he got to his feet
with one leg wobbly and hurt and started to hobble
away but his kindly old eyes caught the upright stare

of the man whp could not move he thought of the
time he had also been helpless and waited for men to
come and put him in a grave his big heart would not
let him leave the helpless man to be consumed he
reached down and dragged the stiff length of him to
his feet and balanced him as he strove to make his
wounded leg obey his will

vandyke revives

the heat grew more intense already little waves
of heat were quivering from the walls and it
smarted his hands and face unbearably it began blister-
ing long before the blade of fire reached them zulerich
dragged vandyke over to the fountain hoping by some
miracle the blade of flame would miss them and he could
cool its reflection with the warm water yet it came
steadily on traveling upon them like sunshine across the
earth through a rift of fast moving cloud

  his whole thought then was of the alkali drops if
there was only some way to revive vandyke they could
run back to the vault and both be saved but there was
no way to revive him at all that zulerich knew without
alkali the rigid man was as helpless as an image of
stone

  his own leg badly hurt zulerich stared about the
palace like a trapped wolf his eyes swept the burned
furnishings the brick red blisters upon the white marble
walls the little heaps of ash which had been lounges
tapestries pictures and doors then he looked again into
the upstaring eyes of the only living thing beside himself
in that charnel house of destruction

  again he begged of heaven and earth some way to
put movement into vandyke true the man was a
tyrant a selfish brute man who had sought just that by
torturing him and still vandyke was the last link old
zulerich knew which might control the telecops he had
to save him not through pity so much as to save the
key to the mechanical men for they alone could restore
order to an unrestrained race

  he splashed water over himself and then over van-
dyke it steamed as it soaked the hot clothing the steam
of it seemed to scald him this must surely be the end
he thought he must either abandon vandyke and the
key to power over the mob or be consumed in the flames
himself he let vandyke fall and turned to run his
feet crunched fallen ash of the thick carpet which had
threaded the stairs and that gave him his solution
ashes were alkali

  he turned back to the man who lay across the marble
parapet of the dazzling pool he stooped and raked a
handful of ash from the stair and crammed it into the
open mouth he dipped a handful of water and washed
the ash down

  vandyke lay tense for a moment much as he had done
through all the months since zulerich had given him the
drops of eternal life then he quivered a little he
seemed to realize what had happened to him he leaped
to his feet and shouted in a tongue that was hissing and
strange

  there came a rumbling down the hall it grew and
reverberated throughout the heated place a weird
phoenixian life seemed roused within the blistered halls
it was the measured tread of iron men as they came
marching from their position against the seared walls

  vandyke turned and fled for the vault leaving old
zulerich alone

  zulerich stared helplessly at the back of the fleeing
man there was little use in trying to follow his leg
the eternal man revives



was badly hurt and he had delayed to revive vandyke
he could not run fast enough to reach the vault before
being overtaken by that speeding blade of the heat rays

  vandyke darted about the wall at the head of the
stair he would certainly make the vault in time he
would live on and on alone king of earth ruler of
telecops and master of men king of earth ruler of
ruthless control that asked no favors and feared no odds
it would be a tyranny a thousand fold more unendur-
able than that zulerich had sought to overthrow before
there were many rulers one suspicious of another now
there would be no check at all on the power of this new
king

  zulerich flung himself into the fountain pool he did
not expect the water which was already almost too hot
to bear to protect him from the heat ray but with all
his eternal life old zulerich was human and he post-
poned a dreaded thing as long as he possibly could

  a telecop came clanging by with iron shod heels that
bit into the blistered marble zulerich reached from the
pool and caught the mechanical man around the calf of
his leg with arms that were strong with fear he twined
his own legs around that iron one and was carried down
the stairs with the six foot strides which took four steps
at a time the telecop made no effort at all to shake
him loose it was obeying an order which sent it straight
to its duty and paid no attention to what it might trample
or thrust aside

  old zulerich held on with no idea at all where the
thing was taking him he hardly cared just so he got
away from the barrage of those oncoming rays but
at the next floor down he saw with a dull hopelessness
that the telecop was striding straight toward the ad-
vancing fire

  he let go of the leg and fell beside a door the tele-
cop ran onunmindful of him he got painfully to his
feet and opened the door then he went down on all
fours and crawled into the room it was a large sunny
room with big windows lining the east and south zule-
rich stared at them helplessly there was no protection
here

  before he could crawl away he found he had no more
need to fear that flash for it was stricken from the
palace and snapped out evidently vandykes command
had been broadcast to telecops much nearer the power
controls than the palace

what the book revealed

with an intense relief zulerich halted and dragged
himself into a chair then for a time the scien-
tific curiosity of his nature was stronger than the pain
of his wound he was in one of the famed experiment
rooms where machines of various types were perfected

  all around him was a bewildering array of strange
contrivances there were great vacuum tubes taller than
a man induction coils as large as an ordinary room wet
and dry batteries as large as the vault in which he had
escaped the sunflame and other batteries as small as
thimbles electrical charges were running through the
tubes with violet green and blue fires and one of them
glowed with a flame that was almost black there were
electrodes with knobs as large as footballs which reflected
his half-bald head in their polished brass wires ran
here and there while buttons and switches crowded the
table

  zulerich got up from his chair and hobbled around
looking curiously at the complicated mechanism he
found his way behind a panel of switches and sat upon

a stool to examine his leg there seemed to be an in-
complete fracture of the shin bone but it was not as
bad as it was painful he thought it would heal with
a few weeks in bed he lost interest in his wound when
he found a book lying open upon the table before him
where a scientist had probably last written in it before
going down to join the rulers when they drank their
pale green drops

  the book proved to be a tabulation of experiments
which the scientist had been making zulerich became
so interested in it he forgot vandyke was alive and that
he would probably try to destroy him he forgot his
blistered hands and face forgot the destroyed rulers and
the nightmare of horrible sunflame he forgot every-
thing except the marvel of scientific data before him
and the audacity of what the scientist claimed

  it seemed the man believed that all matter all life
all energy everything in the universe was electricity in
various forms and the man had proved it

  the paper dealt with molecules atoms electrons and
protons of course old zulerich knew of these long ago
the marvel was what this man claimed to have done with
these tiny components of the universe he claimed that
by placing a strip of metal between the electrodes of a
machine at zulerichs right hand and turning a dial
upon the table an electron or proton could be taken or
added at will which would change the metal into any
substance desired according to the formula given

  the book also claimed that the switch upon the panel
behind him controlled a current to the tall vacuum tubes
and that any substance placed between the electrodes
and the switch thrown would have its electrons stuck
close to its protons and form an inert mass which zule-
rich had once known in theory as neutrons material
could thus be shrunk either completely into a neutronic
mass or partially by narrowing the orbit of the electron
around its proton the scientist claimed tt have shrunk
foot thick pieces of metal until they seemed to dis-
appear though in truth they were still in existence as
infinitesimal particles of the same metal a mass of
steel weighing sixty million tons if shrunk until iti
protons and electrons touched and formed neutron
would fill a space of no more than a cubic inch

  this all sounded impossible to zulerich though in
reason he could not see why it should not be dont if
there was as much space between the electron and its
proton as he had always believed

  one paragraph particularly interested him it read
about like this

  my conclusion is that it is quite possible for a
properly equipped scientist to now expand or shrink
metals at will by narrowing or expand the orbir of its
electrons at the command of the imperial council of
ten i have placed electrodes at equal intervals alxut the
palace as an added precaution in case the people should
ever discover the secret code which governs thj police
and turn them against us by switching the current
through the knife of the center switch of the panel the
palace may be contracted to the size of a drop ot water
and by reversing the switch expanded again to itw present
size one should be careful not to fully contract the
orbit of its electrons so as to form the new substance
concluded on page 

   our author refers here to the theory that in an atom the actual
pace occupied by its material ubstance-the proton and elittrons-is
only an infinitesimal part of the actual volume of the atom most of
the volume is blank space so it was believed by the scientis referred
to that of the blank spaces could be eliminated and the protons and
electrons crowded together an incomprehensibly compact mass could be
formed

boundary back of the mountains
lay slavonia enormous relatively
poor and always seeking a seaport so
that she could enter into profitable
commerce with the world for cen-
turies she had tried to conquer par-
vonia and for as many centuries the
little kingdom had been able to hold
her enemy at arms length by clever
politicians and by the aid of the
other european nations

  but the time had come when the
allies of slavonia held the balance
of political power the friends of
parvonia had all that they could do
to attend to their own troubles

they even secretly informed the
little nation that if trouble came
they would be unable to furnish the
usual help this at-
titude was soon noised
around in political
circles in europe and
slavonia knew for
the first time that the
seaport of her dreams
was available when-
ever she wished to
stretch out her hands
and seize it

  parvonia realized
her danger and tried
in every way to pre-
pare for it her to-
tal available man-
power was small less
than twenty thousand
all told in past ages
her women had
fought by the side of
the men and they
would do so again in
extremes but this
would make only

twenty thousand more warriors against this handful
slavonia would be able to place a half million soldiers
in the first line of battle

   this would not be a war it would be a debacle

  consequently it was with sinking hearts that the
grand council of parvonia met to consider a note from
her enemy this note was couched in polite terms it
began in fact in protestations of the warmest friend-
ship the fact was commented on that for over two
hundred years the two nations had lived without any
overt act of war it reviewed the various treaties of
peace written and lived up to that had existed for many
centuries in consideration of all these friendly histori-
cal facts it would seem only a small matter for the

    t is a well-known fact that the atmospheric blanket of
 the earth shields us from many rays that emanate in
 space some of these are perceptible the cosmic
 rays are believed by many to be very destructive in their
 effect upon organic matter and it is felt that if it were not
 for our atmosphere life would not be possible on this
 pianet the same is believed to be true of the rays that
 emanate from the sun that it is our atmosphere that strains
 out of the suns rays those that are most destructive

   many fables that have come down to us from the past
 attribute a destructive effect to moonlight in fact people
 exposed to the moons rays were popularly supposed to be
 come insane-hence the words lunacy and looney

   dr keller as a physician takes the problem of the
 moons rays and constructs a story which not only has an
 excellent basis of scientific thought but is also both whim-
 sical and humorous in other words we are warning our
 readers that this story has its lighter sides and that our
 author does not mean us to take it with the same intense
 seriousness as some of his other stories

smaller nation to help the larger one in its commercial
difficulties and by combining their resources make
the seaport of atlanta available for the commerce of
slavonia without any import or export duties in other
words would it not be a timely act for the two nations
to be merged into one under a single government the
new nation to be known as slavonia 

   it was hoped the official letter went on to hint that
parvonia would look at this matter in a friendly man-
ner and not make it necessary to re-
sort to anything as old-fashioned
and horrible as war but so great
was the need of slavonia for a sea-
port the note added that it was
only fair to state that she was bound
to have one irrespective of the ef-
fort it took and as the only one
available was atlanta capital of
parvonia why that was the one
that she was determined to have

  after reading this letter which
concluded with the statement that
an answer would be expected within
a month the secretary of foreign
affairs handed it in a most formal
manner to the president of par-
vonia that country by the way
like so many other european enti-
ties had changed the name of its
ruler from king to president how-
ever the people had softened the
blow by electing the
former king to the
presidency and by
making the term of
office for life it was
really no longer the
fashion to have kings
but their love for
michael made it im-
possible for his sub-
jects to do anything
else but continue him
as the head of the
country

president

michael of par-
vonia took the letter in
his hand he had an
unlighted cigarette in
his mouth at the time
and with his free
hand he struck a
match this match
was in an apparently absent-minded manner placed to
the letter rather than to the cigarette it was only when
it was thoroughly in flames that michael seemed to notice
his error smiling he commented on it

  i always seem to do the wrong thing now it must
be evident to all of you that i meant to light my cigar-
ette but i am very much afraid that my action will be
misinterpreted by the good people in slavonia seri-
ously i fear that this is the beginning of the end
or the ending of the beginning interrupted the
secretary of foreign affairs

  there was practically no further discussion it was
felt that the only thing to do was to fight one battle
and then die as a nation at once preparations were

 
	wonder stories quarterly

made for mobilization envoys were sent to all the
friendly nations asking for their aid but it was real-
ized that this was for the first time quite a useless
step

  after that wasdone with a feeling of utter despair
the grand council adjourned

  to the surprise of all they were reconvened in eigh-
teen hours and at this second meeting a stranger was
present president michael lost no time in introducing
him

  gentlemen of the grand council i wish you to
meet mr peter perkins who has just arrived from the
united states in his private yacht which is anchored
in our magnificent seaport it appears that a year ago
he met and entertained our secretary of war while
that gentleman was touring the united states in search
of financial aid for our nation in fact the greater
part of the loan of ten million dollars in american
gold was subscribed by mr perkins it seems that
he has many investments in europe which from time
to time he investigates and at this most opportune
time he has arrived at parvonia to see just what was
done with his ten million and what the chances are for
his securing his interest naturally our secretary of
the treasury was forced to tell him that unless some-
thing wonderful happened his investment would be
lost when our nation became a hopeless servile portion
of slavonia he requested permission to address the
council and it is for this purpose that i have sum-
moned you i do not know how he can help us but
i do know that he comes here as a friend and we cer-
tainly welcome him

  peter perkins smiled his appreciation of this intro-
duction lighting a lone cigar he started to talk with-
out even the formality of rising to his feet

  of course folks ten million is ten million and
i do not care to see it just absolutely lost but it
seems to me that there is something more than money
at stake here there is a principle involved now if
only parvonia were on the other side of the ocean the
monroe doctrine would protect you whether you
wanted to be looked after or not but we americans
have had all the foreign involvements that we desire
and even though my country would be indignant about
the way slavonia is treating you they would feel that
they had to keep out of it the very fact that this ten
million is at stake makes it impossible for the united
states to interfere

  however i am here to do something definite and
i think that perhaps we can combine that idea with
your trouble in such a way that we can be of real aid
to you my suggestion is that you write a polite answer
to slavonia sort of stalling them off and asking for
sixty days instead of thirty to arrive at a final decision
that will give me just so much extra time to go on
with my scientific investigations and to see what can
be done to help you if our plans are successful then
you will be safe till the next time in the interval of
thirty or sixty days you might do what you can to
strengthen your frontier but i would advise that you
do not spend very much in this manner if i succeed
your efforts will be money wasted and if i fail all the
money that you can spend will do you no good

  what are you going to do asked president
michael

  i hesitate to tell you not because i fear that you
will not keep my secret but the plan is so remarkable
and perhaps in a way so foolish that you would sim-
ply laugh at me and become more desperate i will tell
you this however i am going to spend over five mil-

lion dollars just as fast as i can and i am going to
spend it all in slavonia

  briber- asked the secretary of foreign affairs

  propaganda questioned the secretary of war

  neither one was the answer both of those
plans would only mean unlimited trouble in the future
our plan is entirely different from anything that has
ever been done before or perhaps ever been thought
of before you leave the details with me and at the
proper time i will take you into my confidence

a great experiment

as that was all he would say the meeting ended
but this time there was not the deep despair that
had accompanied -the ending of the previous meeting
it was generally felt that americans were queer but
very capable and the very thought of a mans being
willing to spend five million dollars in an untried ex-
periment thrilled even the most practical of the leaders
of parvonia

  peter perkins at once returned to his yacht and
went into conference with a man who was as cele-
brated in his specialty as perkins was in the field of
finance

  now here is your chance dr hamilton the fi-
nancier announced we left new york with the idea
that somewhere in the world we could find a commu-
nity on which we could perform our experiment with
at least some justification after you appealed to me
for funds to carry out your investigations i felt more
than interested but at the same time i could not recon-
cile myself to working on human beings now these
people in slavonia are determined to slaughter my
friends in parvonia and if they actually start a war
thousands will be killed anyway so whatever we can
do will be really humane instead of anything like vivi-
section of course it is going to be on a much larger
scale than what you thought of but if it works with a
few hundred people it ought to work with a few
million suppose we go over all our plans and start at
once for slavonia we have at the most sixty days
and perhaps only thirty there is no time to waste
we shall have to buy a newspaper there and use their
men and their plant there will be no difficulty in that
gold buys everything these days there is only one
thing that is bothering me are you sure that your plan
will work

  no was the blunt answer of doctor hamilton if
i were sure that it would succeed there would be no
use of experimenting it is just a theory perhaps it
ought to be called a hypothesis i feel that there is a
fair chance of success and that is all that i can say
but if it works at all it will save the day for your
friends and it will also perform a great service to
medical science i think that it is worth the trial

  i like that answer commented peter perkins it
is the answer of an honest man i have always felt
that you were truthful not only to the world but also
to yourself i am strong for you and to show that i
am in earnest i am going to throw five million into
the experiment if it works i will save my ten million
in parvonia and if it does not work it was at least
a fifty-fifty game of chance-and that is the way that
i made my fortune taking chances

  that night the two men from america with a little
baggage and two servants took the train for serenia
the capital of slavonia the usual trouble in crossing
the frontier was eliminated by the liberal use of bribes
and within twenty-four hours peter perkins was in the
the moon rays	

office of the owner of the serenia press asking that
worthy what he would take for his paper printing plant
and good will and whether he would stay on as one of
the editors of the paper under the new management
the astonished newspaper man who for years had tot-
tered on the verge of bankruptcy sold his business and
accepted employment as quickly as possible trembling
lest the foolish american would change his mind before
the papers were signed

  at once the entire policy of the serenia press was
changed from a weekly it was converted to a daily
and instead of fifty thousand copies being printed ar-
rangements were at once made to print a million or
even two million if necessary the first three issues
under the new ownership were startling in their edi-
torial policy the new paper was to be a popular one
it was to be printed for the best interests of the com-
mon people the army was not to be neglected and
ever- day a quarter million copies were to be distrib-
uted free among the soldiers of slavonia this activity
was to be continued some time certainly for the next
sixty days

  but the most startling news contained in the third
issue of the paper was a notice of a series of cash prizes
which were to be given once a week for five weeks
these were not to be awarded on the basis of educa-
tion in fact anyone could try for one of the prizes
the first prize was to be one half million dollars in
gold then there were to be ten prizes of a hundred
thousand each fifty of ten thousand a hundred of one
thousand ten thousand of a hundred each besides
every one who brought an answer or sent it to the
office would be given a five dollar gold piece in fact
it was calmly stated that over ten million in gold would
be distributed to the fortunate slavonians within the
next two months this same issue contained a state-
ment from the president of the slavonian national
bank that peter perkins the owner of the paper was
worth many times this amount of money and that ar-
rangements were to be made at once to deposit at least
ten million of gold in the bank

  all that was necessary was the purchase of a paper
the careful reading of the terms of the contest the
filling in of one of the blank forms printed in each
issue of the paper and the mailing or presenting in
person of this blank to one of the officers of the paper
each person could hand in only one blank the larger
prizes would be given but once at the end of the fifth
week but the ten thousand prizes of one hundred dol-
lars each would be given out at the rate of two thou-
sand every week

  to properly judge the contest five hundred clerks
were employed and in a purely supervisory capacity
fifty college professors as these persons were not
to contest for the prizes they were adequately paid
the clerks each receiving five thousand dollars for their
five weeks of service and the professors twenty-five
thousand each the fact that these judges were paid
in advance in gold was substantial proof that the prize
offer was a bonafide one

the announcement

inside of twenty-four hours no one in slavonia was
talking about anything except the madness of the
rich american and his own determination to secure at
least one of the larger prizes each family that had
many children considered itself fortunate as each child
could send in one answer and receive for it at least
five dollars slavonia was a poor country many of its

population had never even seen a gold piece let alone
having owned one and the thought that in the next
five weeks every native of the country old and young
male and female might possess one of the yellow beau-
ties thrilled the imagination of the slavonians as noth-
ing had done for a long time

  the contest was such a simple one that even the
humblest peasant would have a chance to win the first
prize there was just nothing to it it was so easy
excited groups gathered around the paper while one
read aloud

  everyone has heard of the man in the moon no
  doubt almost every slavonian has seen the woman
  in the moon but how about the rabbit or the
  bundle of faggots or the bunch of cabbage
  leaves all these objects and many more can be
  seen in the moon in its different phases the moon
  is now new watch it -and see how many things
  you can see in it write your list on the blank
  form with your name and address and state
  whether you are trying for the weekly prize or one
  of the larger ones bring or send your answer to
  one of the local offices and receive your initial
  prize of five dollars watch this space for further
  notices on the eighth day a list of the winners of
  the first weeks prizes will be announced

  for the first week the citizens of slavonia were
divided into two groups one part entered seriously
into the contest with the expectation of winning one
of the prizes the rest of the country remained skep-
tical and satisfied that it was all a trick on the part of
the foolish american to increase the circulation of his
paper and that in some way he would evade the pay-
ment of the prizes on the eighth day however a list
of two thousand names appeared as being the winners
of the prize of five hundred dollars each these ten
thousand fortunate winners were from all parts of the
country and in every walk of life peasants shared with
lawyers and professional men the shower of gold with-
in twenty-four hours the attitude of the scoffers
changed and they hurried as they never had before in
their lives to secure a share of the gold in the follow-
ing weeks

  at the end of the second week another group of
two thousand prize winners were awarded five hundred
dollars each at this time a list of thirty objects was
printed with the statements that these had been dup-
licated so frequently by the contestants that they would
no longer lie considered as available for use in the
weekly contests though they could be used in the lists
submitted for the larger prizes

  the moon was now nearly full never in the his-
tory of the world had so many thousand persons spent
so many hours looking at the silver orb the moon-
gazing affected every vital portion of the life of sla-
vonia the clerks were dull and sleepy after their long
hours of looking and trying to identify the hills and
valleys of the moon with some familiar object espe-
cially was the army affected theefficiency and routine
being sadly disturbed an effort had been made at
first to limit the number of hours that a soldier could
remain out of barracks but when it was discovered
that the officers were looking at the moon while the
privates had to sleep a mutiny resulted that was pre-
vented from becoming serious only by allowing all

soups of the military forces the same nocturnal privi-
e-

  dictionaries were forced into use art galleries were
frequented ancient authorities such as wolf tobler
and praetorius were freely consulted by those who
	wonder stories quarterly

were able to read the learned boasted of lists con-
taining two thousand resemblances and even more
college savants were as enthusiastic as the poorest ser-
vant one proudly quoting a description of the moon
in de naturis rerum written by alexander neckam
in the twelfth century

   nonne novisti quid vulgus vocet rusticum in luna
portantum spinas

   all however was not easy going for the serenia
press several times groups of disappointed citizens
came near wrecking the establishment which was saved
only by the prompt and effective use of the army cer-
tain political parties tried in every way to force the
government to stop the paper as they claimed that the
contest was sadly demoralizing every part of the nation-
al life peter perkins however shrewdly added these
disappointed politicians to his force of judges making
as it were a group of super-judges and thus by an-
other shower of gold he turned potential enemies into
enthusiastic friends

   in this surprising course of events the annexation of
parvonia was for the time apparently lost sight of
rival papers existing only because they were in the
habit of doing so boldly stated in their editorials that
the nation was really being corrupted by this influx of
gold and that every one was better off in the good old
days of poverty they even went so far as to claim
that peter perkins had come to slavonia for no other
purpose than to divert that nation from its plan to
conquer parvonia perkins in his answering editorials
showed the folly of such a thought and proved that
the nation enriched by his gold would be better able
than before to begin a war he even suggested and
the legislature was not slow in adopting the hint that a
tax of ten percent be levied on all income not earned
by regular employment and at once every prize win-
ner was forced to divide with the government

   at the end of the third week a preliminary announce-
ment was made of a hundred winners of a thousand
dollars each and the money was promptly given to the
fortunate parties some of this gold was spent fool-
ishly but there were many who bought land and homes
or else hid it away in their houses habits of cen-
turies were hard to overcome thrift had always been
an enforced habit with the citizens of slavonia but
still the truth of easy come easy go was seen in
the number of new victrolas and small automobiles that
were bought by the prize winners jewelry was also
purchased and never in the history of the state had
there been as many weddings in such a short time

at the end of a month orders were given to the
commander-in-chief of the slavonian army to
advance over the frontier of parvonia the army
refused to do so they claimed that it was not fair to
ask them to begin a war when millions of dollars were
to be distributed in another week they urged their
officers to petition the government to wait for at least
another month and unable to take any other course
the secretary of war acceded to their demand

   but the cabinet officers of slavonia were not the
only ones in that part of europe that were uneasy
peter perkins and his friend dr hamilton waited
anxiously for indications that their experiment was
really working the one man was interested from a
financial standpoint while the other was thrilled by the
idea that something could be added to the sum total of
scientific knowledge slowly through the month the
moon had grown from a young crescent to full per-
fection and then had slowly shrunk to an old crescent

a full cycle of the moon had passed and so far nothing
unusual had happened five million persons had looked
at the moon with an intensity that had never before
been shown by a number that large-and still nothing
had happened

  the two men day after day faced each other with
the dreadful thought that maybe nothing would hap-
pen and that after all their experiment had been based
on false premises it was an awkward situation per-
haps never had such a sum of money been expended in
an experiment in group psychology in another week
the final prizes would have to be awarded the interest
would die down the citizens of slavonia would cease
to study the moon and then would come the conquest
of parvonia it is no wonder that both of the amer-
icans became rather neurasthenic at the same time it
is to their credit to state that they controlled themselves
very well never once did peter perkins show any
irritability or resentment over the possible failure of
his plans and dr hamiltons experiment

  on the twenty-ninth evening the two men had dinner
together dr hamilton was in a pleasant state of mind
and lost no time in making the fact known to his asso-
ciate

  i have just been talking to the head of the depart-
ment of marriages he tells me that during this month
his office has issued ten times as many licenses as in
any past month in the history of the marriage bureau
he also comments on the fact that divorces have been
very frequent this month and that practically all the
divorcees have remarried i think that this is a very
interesting fact and may mean something

  i am not sure of that replied perkins there are
always a lot of marriages just before a war and then
you have to remember that we have been making many
of the marriages a possibility from the financial stand-
point have you heard anything else

  yes though this last cost me a pretty sum to un-
cover twelve of the most important divisions in the
slavonian army have been demobilized on account of
an epidemic of illness it is rather hard to obtain any
exact description of this disease but evidently it is
some form of mental disorder that has rendered both
officers and privates unable to conform to military dis-
cipline there also seem to be sporadic episodes of a
peculiar lawlessness throughout the country many
respectable citizens who before this time have been
most exemplary in their conduct have been acting in
peculiar and unusual manners it is hard to place a
definite value on all these different facts but i feel
certain that the next week will determine the real value
of our plan frankly i must say that i am afraid that
it may succeed the very thought of its doing so is
alarming

  i admit that said perkins i feel that it might
have been better to have offered slavonia so many
millions if they had allowed the idea of war with par-
vonia to pass from their minds but had i done that
they would simply have wanted more millions next
year in some way they had to be taught a lesson and
if this is the lesson then we are simply instruments in
the hand of a greater power have you any idea if
it does work how long the effects will last 

  none whatever i think that in less than six months
all will be back to normal that is not the question
what will happen in those six months

  no one can say but surely not all will be affected
have we any idea as to how many claimed the five
dollar reward
the moon rays



  over half a million we were limited by our ca-
pacity to hand out the gold pieces

  that is not so bad and it is probable that a very
small percent of the population worked at the problem
for the entire month i feel that there will be enough
normal persons left to handle the emergency but they
will be so busy that for months to come they will have
no inclination for an unnecessary war i feel that we
did the best thing had there been a war thousands
would have been killed and mutilated-

  just then a servant announced visitors when ad-
mitted they proved to be the secretary of state and
the secretary of the department of public health
the first named official at once opened the conver-
sation

  in a way our visit is purely unofficial at the same
time we felt the urgent necessity of calling on you and
discussing affairs of the greatest importance to our
country it is needless to tell you that your advertis-
ing program has absolutely disturbed slavonia as noth-
ing has in the past the people are restless excited
almost insane during the next week this excitement
will increase when the time comes for the distribu-
tion of the larger prizes there will be serious rioting
if you fail in any way to keep your promises even if
you do there will be so many disappointed persons that
i am afraid for your safety i believe that it would be
best for you and your business associates to leave the
distribution of the prizes in the hands of the govern-
ment and get out of the country till the excitement dies
down

  there is another thing that is giving us concern
interrupted the secretary of public health in all
parts of the country our people are acting in an un-
usual and peculiar manner there seems to be almost
an epidemic of mental illness we shall be forced to
enlarge our hospitals in order to care for the more
serious cases could you give us a donation for this
purpose  and does dr hamilton understand why any-
thing like this should happen at this time 

exciting days

t will talk for dr hamilton answered peter

  jl perkins we will leave the country when the
time comes we have a plane and a trained pilot in
constant readiness as for turning over the cash for
the large prizes to the government i feel that this
would be the wrong thing to do however it is an in-
teresting fact that the winner of the first prize of one
half million dollars in gold is theophilus strauss i
wonder if that is the honorable secretary of state
mr strauss did you enter the contest you did
then you are the winner of the first prize and i shall
draw a check in your favor at once unless you want
to adhere to your original suggestion and have me turn
it over to the government with the other prizes i
think that you had better take it and i am sure that
you agree ivith me i shall be glad to give the health
department a quarter million to help them in this epi-
demic it is unfortunate that it happened at this time
just when you were going to enter into such a glorious
war with parvonia perhaps the sudden flood of gold
into your country was too much for the temperamental
minds of your people sudden wealth often is very
disturbing and now i shall ask you to excuse us for
we are very busy

  once more alone the two americans looked at each
other

    poor devils exclaimed dr hamilton

  but wonderful grafters added peter perkins
what fine officials they would make in the united
states did you note how quickly the secretary of
state changed his tune when he found that he could
make a half million for himself and how much of
the money for hospitals is going to stick to the hands
of the secretary of public health however i feel
that it would be a good idea to turn the entire matter
over to the former owner of the paper and ask him to
distribute the prizes i feel that this is not going to be
a very healthy country for us in a few weeks and per-
haps even in a few days the scientists of the nation
have not discovered as yet what we have done to their
people when they do they are not going to feel kindly
toward us

  during the next few days rioting started in every
town and city in slavonia had there been any con-
certed action the government would have been over-
thrown but it was a peculiar form of civic disturbance
all the participants seemed to act on their own initia-
tive and were apparently unable to unite in any definite
act with other individuals the police and army seemed
powerless to prevent the disturbance as many of these
forces were also acting peculiarly even the govern-
ment was impotent on account of the large percentage
of disability colleges were closed as the professors
had become oddly incapable of teaching and as the
average student refused to attend classes if they did
attend they paid absolutely no attention to the in-
struction

  meanwhile the paper was published as usual now
and then one of the larger prizes was announced and
the sworn statement of the winner printed to the effect
that he had received the money this only added to
the excitement one night perkins dr hamilton and
the pilot quietly reached their plane and rose into the
air headed directly for parvonia far beneath them lay
disturbed slavonia here and there fires told of the
rioting while sporadic gun fire bore the message of the
feeble efforts of the troops to hold the enraged popu-
lace in check the men were strangely silent on this
trip whatever they thought they kept to themselves
peter perkins sat with eyes closed while dr hamil-
ton was busy making notes in shorthand finally the
harbor of atlanta came into view and the plane landed
in the municipal airfield the two men entered a taxi
and went at once to a hotel

  later on to be exact at nine a m of the next day
another meeting of the grand council of parvonia was
held in the private chambers of the president of the
nation peter perkins was there also dr hamilton
president michael opened the meeting

  gentlemen of the grand council he said as the
head of the nation i have today received an urgent
appeal for funds to aid the work of the international
red cross it appears that an emergency of the great-
est importance has arisen in slavonia and it is be-
lieved that millions of dollars will have to be spent
there before a normal condition is restored the tele-
gram was vague in its detail but it seems that the na-
tion has developed a condition bordering on commu-
nity or mass psychosis the workers have ceased to
work the ruling class are incompetent the army and
police force are in a serious mutiny and even the aver-
age citizen is acting in various peculiar ways on my
own initiative i wired a contribution of a half million
from the entire nation i trust that this will meet with
your approval a war would have cost us many times
that amount as well as our national liberty

  now this evening we have with us our american
	wonder stories quarterly

friends when they last met with us they talked of
doing something to prevent war with slavonia that
war is now an impossibility due to the unfortunate
wave of sickness that has swept our enemys country
at the time of our last meeting our friend mr peter
perkins was very vague in his statements i trust that
he will pardon and assuage our curiosity and tell us
just what he did if anything to bring about such a
kindly ending to our troubles

  the american captain of industry stood up he was
a different man in some ways than he was when he
last met the grand council of parvonia he seemed
to realize that he was changed-there was less bragga-
docio in his voice a softer manner in his choice of
words

  my friends he said i think that i can call you
that this evening because of what i have done for you
and suffered for you dr hamilton and i have been
through a most trying experience it is safe to say
that during the past six weeks we have done the work
of a dozen average men this work was all the more
trying because of our absolute inability to foretell the
results and also because we had the unhappy sensation
that we were experimenting with human beings and
even though they were enemies of parvonia they were
still flesh and blood and body and soul the same as we

  the advances in the scientific side of medicine have
always been checked because there has been an un-
willingness to use human material in experimental
work probably for the first time in the history of the
human race they were experimented with by the mil-
l this was justifiable on account of the emergency
bui at the same time it was a most serious business
and i became almost a neurasthenic myself however
we prevented the conquest of parvonia and at the
same time dr hamilton found out some facts of
great scientific value i do not know just what the
whole experiment cost me but if by spending the
money i was able to prevent another war it was well
spent why not let dr hamilton tell just what we
tried to do i am sure that you would enjoy hearing
him doctor you tell these men all about it i know
that they can be trusted to keep our secret

the doctor explains

t am sure that we want to hear the learned doc-

  x tor remarked president michael there is no
doubt that mr perkins furnished the money for this
experiment which money we hope some day to replace
but dr hamilton must have been the source of the
scientific inspiration back of this much talked-of ex-
periment concerning which we are still in absolute
ignorance i can assure the learned doctor that any
statement which he wishes to remain a secret will be
carefully guarded by all of us

  dr hamilton had also changed during these weeks
of stress white hairs were now plentiful amid the
black ones and there were lines in his face that had
not been there two months before

  gentlemen of parvonia he began i want to thank
your president for his kind introduction i feel that
mr perkins is to be given all the credit for our ex-
periment because it was his energy financial ability
and genius for organization that enabled us to put
through the work of the last six weeks

  over a year ago i sought his aid in regard to cer-
tain experiments which i thought would be of value
to the human race briefly my idea at that time was
this in the rays of sunlight there are a variety of
different light rays of different values and lengths

some of these are very beneficial to the human being
and others are harmful and are even deadly if exposure
to them is prolonged only recently it was found that
some of the most beneficial rays were excluded by ordi-
nary window glass so the use of quartz glass was
advised in various chronic diseases

  for many years i have been studying the light rays
from the moon as you know the moon is a dead
body and simply reflects the light thrown on it by the
sun this reflected light being one-five hundred thou-
sandth the intensity of the suns light neverthe-
less the moon is a large mass of metal probably for
all we know similar in composition to a meteor was
it possible that this moon metal under the suns rays
gave off emanations which influenced or altered the
sunlight so that when it was reflected to the earth as
moonlight it had various properties not possessed by
sunlight if this was true would these moonbeams
have any direct effect beneficial or otherwise on the
human being

  in studying this question i was at once impressed
with the scanty material that we had to work with the
anthropologist told us that primitive man was somewhat
afraid of moonlight and that while it gave him pro-
tection against the beasts still it also favored the
beasts in hunting man so primitive man kept in his
cave as much on moonlight nights as on moonless
nights the greenlanders believed that the moon was
a male spirit and that it killed any woman whom it
shone on when it was full if a woman saw the cres-
cent moon she was likely to become impregnated from
a moonbeam the early races bordering around the
great sea credited the moonlight with causing in-
sanity and from this superstition arose the word
lunatic

  but could the moonlight cause mental disturbances 
we all know the supposed effect of the full moon on
love-making all the poets have stressed the effect of
the moon on the sexual desires at the same time the
artificiality of our present life is such that only seldom
do any human beings spend any length of timfe in the
moonlight they are in their homes or places of amuse-
ment and even if they do deliberately go into the
country on a moonlight night they are in their auto-
mobiles or they seek the shelter of secluded shade

  in  benjamin rush made some observations
concerning the effect of moonlight on the insane and
said that their behavior was the same when the moon
was full as when it was in the dark but these persons
were insane to begin with the problem of just what
moonlight would do to sane persons who were fre-
quendy exposed to it was still unsolved

  we found that there was a seeming relation be-
tween the cycle of the moons phases and certain hy-
gienic cycles in the female sex was this just a coin-
cidence or was it really the result of certain light rays
in the moonlight  was it possible that certain types
of human behavior were caused by other rays in the
moonlight  of course we knew that there were many
causes for the various types of insanity but was moon-
light one of them

  the only way that we could tell was by actual ex-
periment and as mr perkins has stated there has
always been a great objection to experimentation on
the human being i finally persuaded him to come to
europe with me to see if we could locate in some iso-
lated section a few hundred persons who would be
willing for pay to allow us to experiment with them
that was what led us to make this trip to europe
when we heard that parvonia was threatened with
the moon rays



war it suddenly occurred to me that here was a chance
to perform an experiment on large masses of human
beings at a time and in such a way that our conduct
would be justified if we could prevent a war that was
unjust and uncalled for then the fact that we altered
for a few months the mental life of a nation would be
sufficient excuse for our experiment

   so i suggested to mr perkins that we expose the
people in slavonia to a prolonged treatment of moon-
light there were millions of people to work on-they
could not be told about what we had in our mind-but
in some way they had to be induced to spend their
nights out in the open looking at the moon so
through the agency of a newspaper we offered large
sums in gold to the persons who were able to identify
the most objects in the moon immediately a large
number of persons of every walk of life spent their
nights looking at the moon the atmospheric con-
ditions were excellent as there are practically no fac-
tories in that country and the many hills and moun-
tains afford the best possible viewpoint of the heavens

   the prize contest started when the moon was an
early crescent and ran for five weeks this gave am-
ple lime for a complete observation and some addi-
tional days for the sending in of the lists

an unexpected consequence

i tt that happened  during this period there was
yv a great increase in the number of divorces
but a large percent of the divorcees at once remarried
the marriages were ten times more numerous than in
any preceding month it seemed that everybody who
was not married used that month to marry in and
those who were not happily married took that month
to try it again thus it seemed that the effect on the
sexual inclinations was all that the ancients claimed
for it and if love is a form of insanity then this month
of moonlight certainly produced a large number of
cases

   but other things happened mankind has always
had to repress its real desires this repression of de-
sire is one of the results of civilization i think that
the main psychic symptom shown by the bulk of the
people of slavonia during this period of mental upset
was this one and all of them started in to do the
things that they wanted to do instead of the things
that custom and social usage and civilization told them
that they should do as a result there was a great in-
crease in misdemeanors and petty crimes the army and

the

 the state police force revolted and became absolutely
 inefficient and untrustworthy society began to disin-
 tegrate respect for law order and the church dis-
 appeared had there been any unity the disorder would
 have passed into a revolution but no two persons
 wanted to do the same thing at the same time in other
 words or rather to use scientific language the popu-
 lace entered into an unusual type of maniac-depressive
 psychosis mainly of the maniac type and this espe-
 cially applied as far as it could be determined only to
 those who had by entering the contest been exposed
 to the rays of the moon during this month

   i believe that the effect will only be temporary no
 doubt within a year all the cases of insanity will have
 recovered but in that year slavonia will have received
 an economic blow that will take her many years to
 recover from these years will be years of security
 and peace for parvonia and perhaps when the next
 threat comes the political situation of the world will
 be in a better state to protect the weak nations

   i feel that we have definitely shown that moonlight
 is harmful i feel that the early folklore concerning
 its harmful effects was based on actual facts only a
 careful survey of this experiment and the comparison
 of the present symptoms with those exhibited by the
 average case of manic-depressive insanity can tell us
 just what etiological value the experiment has there
 may be other factors such as the excitement produced
 by sudden wealth which produce degrees of excite-
 ment but i feel that these can be practically excluded
 and the moonlight considered as the real cause fc- the
 change in the mental life of this nation

   just then a messenger brought a radiogram for peter
 perkins he read it silently then holding up his hand
 he asked for silence as he read it out loud

  dear father during this last
  month i spent many hours with
  rudolph as a result of the moon-
  light and his entreaties i was
  married to him last night please
  send us your blessing and ask his
  father president michael of par-
  vonia to do the same

                   ellen perkins

   the two fathers looked at each other and at last
 smiled

   dr hamilton broke the silence

   just one more proof that moonlight is dangerous
 i hope that they never recover

the war of the planets

the supreme council

  because they had disobeyed the laws of the supreme
council and made an unauthorized expedition to the
neighbor world they were to be considered as undesir-
able citizens unfit to mingle with the law-abiding popula-
tion and their punishment was to be banishment from
their native world because they had released forces of
nature that resulted in the death of millions of innocent
people they were to be subjected to the same forces be-
cause they had depopulated a world they were to repop-
ulate it with their own posterity every member of the
expedition and every person who had joined them in their
recent rebellion against the supreme council were to be
banished to barlenkoz but to impress them with the
difference between the militarists and the pacifists the
pacifists would show them mercy

  the exiles were to select whatever part of barlenkoz
they desired for the home of the race they were destined
to found the supreme council would not set them on
the giant world without any protection whatsoever but
would give them enough synthetic food supplies to last
them for a number of years they would help them to
find caves or shelter of some kind before placing them in
a region where the force of gravity was greater and
where the weight of their own bodies would be six times
as great as that to which they had always been accus-
tomed the women who had taken part in the expe-
dition were to accompany their husbands and any other
ladies who wished to marry any of the militarists were
to be granted that privilege and go along to help repop-
ulate the planet

  but what part of the frozen world would now be fit
for human habitation to the majority of the selenites
it did not matter very much whether or not any part was
habitable so long as they were ridding their own world
of undesirable inhabitants many selenites thought
death was too mild a punishment and that a lingering
death on a frozen world upon which they would be
unable to stand on their feet seemed to be a just punish-
ment but the exiled militarists had noticed that one
small continent appeared to be free from damage no
volcanoes had appeared on it and while other parts of
the world were sinking below a frozen sea their chosen
spot was safe it was not far from the equator and
offered the most favorable climate of all no human in-
habitants were there to dispute their choice and but few
carnivores had ever been seen on this continent their
choice was atlantis an ancient island or small continent
almost as large as australia that then existed in what is
now the atlantic ocean

atlantis

no time was lost in equipping an expedition for the
purpose of carrying the exiles to their future home
fisoka was defiant she refused the pardon offered by
the zerko and remained loyal to her chosen husband
she informed the supreme council that she would rather

go into exile as the slave of a man like krago than re-
main on her native world and share the throne with her
brother

   after an absence of about a year and a half kragos
 party arrived on the earth they now met with an over-
 whelming surprise the surface of the earth was not
 frozen as they had expected to find it the gray clouds
 of volcanic dust had dispersed and settled to the earth
 and the sun was shining with its usual brilliancy the
 volcanoes had ceased their violence as suddenly as it had
 started the ice caps that had threatened to cover the
 entire face of the earth had melted under the attacks of
 a benevolent sun shining supreme in a blue sky dotted
 with fleecy clouds of silver and gold

   in the vicinity of the caucasus mountains and mt
 ararat white refugees of the recent flood were com-
 fortably established the waters had receded and the
 land was dry their sufferings were over but the most
 pitiful group of humanity on the earth was the group
 from another world who had been the cause of the re-
 cent disasters krago and his followers had been
 marooned on the land of their choice the now lost con-
 tinent of atlantis it was a contrast to their former
 visit to the earth-they were no longer the conquerors
 but the conquered-the world they had once thought they
 were saving had banished them to the world they once
 thought they were destroying inside their spheres a
 condition of gravity had been maintained that approxim-
 ated that of the moon but on atlantis terrestrial con-
 ditions prevailed and they were unable to rise to their
 feet

   but their captors had been merciful caves and
 shelter were near and enough food had been left them
 to last for years small belts carrying gravity resisting
 material were given to each of the exiles which would
 support the greater part of their added weight and partly
 compensate for the conditions of terrestrial gravity
 this enabled krago and his followers to stand on their
 feet and walk but they did not have all their accustomed
 freedom of action it was a cruel process but in time
 they would become accustomed to barlenkozian condi-
 tions and after a number of generations their posterity
 would be the most enlightened and progressive peoples
 of the earth but the story of the adventures of the
 atlanteans and the final sinking of their continent is an-
 other story

   the story of humanity has now been brought down to
 within the earliest memories of the terrestrial branch of
 the human race from this period ancient records of
 earlier nations have bridged the gap between the events
 of this story and the present time when the pictures
 from which these stories were taken are brought to the
 earth and my readers see the scenes just described as
 we saw them during our recent sojourn on another
 world the present handful who now tread the globe will
 have a better understanding of the trials and tribulations
 of the multitudes who now slumber in its bosom

neutron this shrinking of the palace i have been
afraid to try out as yet

cornered

zulerich was so interested he did not hear the
door close behind him he read the incredible as-
sertions unmindful that vandyke had entered

  come out from back there old man you cant hide
from me every place in the city can be searched
through a visoscope vandyke snarled

zulerich hobbled to his feet and looked over the table

  vandyke studied him coldly zulerich stood and re-
turned the stare but did not say a word

  you cant die vandyke asserted with a slow de-
liberate emphasis on each word as he smiled sardonic-
ally neither can i old man but we can be consumed
by heat easily really it is ungrateful of me to crisp
you after you saved me as you did but you have fool
ideas and some day maybe when i am asleep you-
well you might be near the suntower and you might-

i dont say you would but you might

  he gave a hissing sound-that strange tongue which
controlled the iron men

  from down the hall came the sound of lockstep tread
marching toward the laboratory

  what are you going to do old zulerich cried re-
membering the power of the sunflame the shrieking men
who had died in the palace and the way they exploded
in the heat

  vandyke did not answer telecops flung open the
door

  zulerich stood helplessly before the giant square-
faced men now they were reddened a little by the
flame which gave them a grotesque clown-like appear-
ance otherwise the intense heat seemed not to have
harmed them at all

  they surrounded the table and clutched at him with
their six-foot arms outstretched

  as the iron fingers reached after him zulerich re-
membered the switch which would shrink the palace to
the size of a drop of water he would be crushed to
a jelly perhaps mangled and left alive forever like the
little rat at the museum but he remembered it would
crush vandyke also and the telecops which had set upon
him the armies of iron soldiers in the city had orders
to keep the people restrained order would be restored
and the world would go ahead in peace and productive-
ness some day when men learned the secret code of the
telecops they would make the steel men their slaves and
perhaps by that time they would have learned how to
govern themselves

  he flung the switch half doubting whether anything
would happen but it was a last desperate chance

  dont vandyke shouted as he jammed closed the
switch and cringed as he expected to feel the walls rush-
ing together to smash him

  but nothing seemed to happen the telecops came
on vandyke gave a startled stare out of the big win-
dows and zulerich seeing the astonishment upon his
face looked also

  the whole earth beyond the windows seemed to be
swelling up it was inflating like a toy balloon blown
by the breath of a lusty boy tall buildings swelled to
mountain height the small planes down in the court

the

 grew and reached instantaneously above the third story
 of the palace men grew tall as towers and reached far
 above the palace palaces towered up like high hills

   zulerich the scientist marvelled at the strange pheno-
 mena of a world popping like a grain of corn what
 had happened  quite suddenly it occurred to him he
 was not to be crushed at all he vandyke and the
 telecops were unharmed shrinking with the palace grow-
 ing smaller and smaller so that the world outside seemed
 to be puffing up

   the men down in the court seemed to shoot skyward
 the nearest mans shoes were all that could be seen of
 him now they were much larger than the palace their
 laces seemed great cotton cables entering eyelets as large
 as tunnels why he could not be larger than a flea

   then the shoes too ran up toward the sky and spread
 wide toward the horizon soon the soles of the shoes
 were higher than the palace only they did not look like
 soles but great ledges of substitute leather

   for a minute he was glad he and vandyke were not
 dead but they could now have no possible influence over
 the peace and comfort of men but then he recalled that
 if the switchwas reversed they would grow back to nor-
 mal again he was still in vandykes power for the
 telecops were as large and powerful in proportion to his
 size as they had ever been when the shock of the new
 experience had gone vandyke would certainly reverse
 the switch and they would grow back to old proportions

   he cudgeled his brain for a way out if he could
 only crash the tube its power would be broken and
 they would remain always microscopically small

   he reached for a bar of steel which was upon the
 table vandyke saw his purpose and shouted something
 to the telecops they leaped and caught his struggling
 arms his strongest efforts were of no avail he was
 like a fly under a mans thumb vandyke walked calmly
 around the table toward the switch which would return
 the palace to its normal size

   brave of you old man he taunted but i am king
 now not only king but i not you am the eternal
 man

   zulerich turned away from the leering triumph in
 vandykes face he stared out the windows where
 the earth was quickly growing more and more enormous
 he expected to see it begin shrinking back with the re-
 versed current

   there came a jar it felt as though something which
 supported the palace had given way the floor beneath
 him seemed to slip downward with accelerating speed

   darkness shot into the windows not a ray of sun-
 shine not a star nor a glow of any kind relieved the
 gloom blackness closed about the palace

   immediately the automatic lights came on softly
 against the white walls and glowed until the room was
 bright as day they cast a reflection upon the windows

   rock and dirt shot past breaking the glass and scat-
 tering debris upon the floor they seemed falling down
 the length of an unending shaft

   zulerich knew what had happened he knew

   all the weight of the palace had been contracted with-
 in the bulk of a drop of water thousands of tons of
 it the earths crust was not strong enough to hold it
 they were sinking to the earths center like a bullet
 dropped into the sea

wis

as a fan and an author

  where would the science-fiction fans be in
their efforts to make converts were it not for
the authors of the science-fiction itself ac-
cordingly i claim that the first palm must per-
force be awarded to some author for that award
i am a competitor

  in   wrote the radio man largely
to amuse my own children and interest them
in science fiction bob davis the discoverer of
edgar rice burroughs charles francis coe and
many other now noted authors immediately
bought it it appeared serially in the argosy
in 

  four serials of mine have appeared since
my latest story is the flashlight brigade
in the scientific detective monthly of may


  two articles by me on science fiction have
appeared in the boston sunday post and in the
excavating engineer

  four more stories by me are shortly to ap-
pear in three different magazines

  thus  am still furnishing the very essential
ammunition for the spreading of science fiction

  but not only that i have also been doftg
considerable of the actual spreading too by the
judicious mailing of marked copies of science
fiction magazines such mailings have resulted
in the enclosed twenty-two newspaper articles
on science fiction

  a letter which i sent to dr charles fort
the noted british author of science fiction re-
sulted in a large display article by him in the
boston sunday post and in a long letter from
him to the vineyard gasette

  copies of a magazine containing a scientific
fiction story which i sent anonymously to the
members of the library committee of the
u s senate resulted in winning at least one
of them to science fiction this gentleman none
other than the chairman of the committee
hon frederick h gillett senior senator from
massachusetts and formerly speaker of the
national house was so impressed by the story
that he wrote an unsolicited letter of apprecia-
tion to the magazine in question which letter
was reproduced and given wide circulalion for
the purpose of winning men of similar mentality
and standing to this type of fiction

  i sent copies of the magazines containing
my story the radio flyers to mrs rich-
ard e byrd the story so impressed her that
she forwarded the copies to the south pole
for admiral byrd to read on his trip home
her letter to me was given wide circulation
i hope the story makes a science fiction fan
of admiral byrd

  always am i seeking for scientific vindica-
tion and verification of stories of science fic-
tion see my attached vindication of both
ray cummings and myself printed in the at-
gosy of march   also the full page
write-up in the milwaukee journal of march
 

  during science fiction week i addressed
the local high school and junior high school
on science tiction

  thus i claim as an author to have furnished
more ammunition than any fan and as a fan
to have done moro propaganda work than any
author

  attached to mr farleys letter was a batch
of photostats of the letters and articles written
to newspapers and magazines relative to science
fiction  stories we can see from the clippings
that his stories have stirred up a great deal of
controversy about the possibilities of future
science and their application to fiction we
have no hesitation therefore in awarding mr
farlev the first prize in this final contest he
is quite right in stating that the authors are
the backbone of the science fiction movement and
by the stories they write they shall be
known mr farleys reputation testifies to
both his ability as a writer and a crusader for
the science fiction movement-editor

second prize 
awarded to f b eason
 jefferson ave east point ga
organized s lynn rohrer society

  i am attaching two newspaper clippings and
a letter as part proof of what i have done for
science and science fiction this for the pur-
pose of competing for the prize offered by you
believing that i have done enough to justify my
competing

  i have been successful in organizing a
branch of the science correspondence club
known as the s lynn rhorer society of great-
er atlanta this being named after s lynn
rhorer the great amateur astronomer and or-
ganizer of the southern cross observatory at
time of this writing we have twelve members
and each a member of the s c c

  i have donated to the society a club house
with lights free my entire collection of scienti-
fic books numbering well over a hundred both
ancient and modern my three inch telescope
and collection of fossilized bones these num-
bering nearly two hundred

  in addition to what i have personally do-
nated to the society there has been donated by
others over two hundred scientific books scien-
tific-fiction books and magazines also a large
collection of ores and rocks from different states
and countries

  my activities in the s c c has been that
of promptly replying to all communications and
obtaining authoritative answers to questions
asked have also been appointed southeastern
regional director of the s c c in addition
have assumed some of the s c cs obliga-
tions for which i am thankful that i could
as the printing of the monthly bulletin the
mailing of same etc

                     east point ga

  we have been familiar with mr easons
work for some time particularly his efforts to
interest amateurs in astronomy one of the
backbone sciences of science fiction the or-
ganization of the s  lynn rohrer society is a
further step in a direction which cannot help
but be beneficial in interesting the masses in
science and therefore in science fiction

  since this material has been received we
understand that the society has grown consider-
ably and is destined to play an active part in
the amateur scientist circles of he south as
an officer of the science correspondence club
the organizer and promoter of the robrer so-
ciety and a fervent advocate for the spread of
astronomy and science fiction we are glad to
award to mr eason the second prize-editor

third prize 
awarded to robert b konikow
secretary boston science club
 warren street roxbury mass

   about three years ago i read my first science
fiction magazine since that time i have read
and saved the copies of the four magazines of
that type that have been published three of
them by yourself i enjoyed them all heartily
and have tried to persuade my friends to read
them i dont know how many arguments i
have gotten into with skeptics who think i am
foolish enough to read that trash some i
have persuaded to change their opinions others
have been harder to convince however this
type of campaigning although it is well worth
the trouble has little to show as definite proof
so i will pass on to another phase

  another mthod of conversion has been the
boston science club i founded this organi-
zation a branch of the science correspondence
club early in january i used as a nucleus
the members of the s c c who lived in
metropolitan boston with this as a start we
tripled our membership in a month we still
have several prospective members the origi-
nal members are all avid science fiction fans
we have persuaded some of the new members

to read science fiction and are still trying to
convince the rest i am enclosing a copy of a
letter that was published in the boston trav-
eler for january   and some of the
answers i got a copy of this letter also ap-
peared in science wonder stories for april
 on page  i also enclose a copy oi
the circular letter sent to the science teachers
in the high schools of this vicinity

  then i have recently been made librarian of
the s c c we intend to form a library of
the best in science and in science fiction
this will help science fiction in two ways all
stories are based on science or they are worth-
less science must be obtained from books
we supply the books an author or a pros-
pective author in a big city can walk into his
library and have his pick of scientific books
but only the largest libraries can afford to keep
up a good science library in addition to their
general collection but we will buy only sci-
ence there we have an advantage also very
few libraries have a collection of science fic-
tion i know the one in boston one of the
largest has almost nothing good science fic-
tion serves as an incentive and as a model and
thus spurs more people on to writing better
science fiction this in turn will create a
bigger demand for it this library will do as
much to promote science fiction as any other
organization in the country

  i am enclosing some letters certifying to my
work here in boston could you please refrain
from using anybodys name unless absolutely
necessary

                    robert b konikow

                      sec boston science club
                       warren street
                      roxbury mass

  mr konikows logic is quite complete sci-
ence fiction depends on good science which de-
pends upon books  so a library is an essential
in the science fiction chain mr konikow ha
an excellent field to work on and with the tart
he has already made he should be able to do
quite a  bit of good work  we  are glad to
award him and his club the third prize-editor

for the best
in science fiction

interplanetary society now
formed

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i wish to inform you of the formation
of the first organization in america
whose sole purpose is the promotion of
interplanetary travel-i refer to the
american interplanetary society quot-
ing its constitution the objects are the
promotion of interest in and experimen-
tation toward interplanetary expeditions
and travel the mutual enlightenment of
its members bearing on the astronomical
physical and other problems pertinent to
mans ultimate conquest of space the
stimulation by expenditure of funds and
otherwise of american scientists toward
a solution of the problems which at pres-
ent bar the way toward travel among the
planets the collection correlation and
dissemination oi facts information
articles books pamphlets and other
literature bearing on interplanetary travel
and subjects relating thereto the estab-
lishment of a library containing such
literature for the information of mem-
bers scientists and others to whom the
privilege may be granted by the society
the raising of funds for research ex-
perimentation and such other activities
as the society may from time to time
deem necessary or valuable in connection
with the general aim of hastening the
day when interplanetary travel shall be-
come a reality

  the society has been organized by a
group of mature scientifically-trained
men who believe that through forming
a strong national society for the encour-
agement of interplanetary experiments
etc a great public interest can be aroused
in the matter and the day when the first
flight is made may be brought closer by
perhaps many years

  the headquarters are located in new
york city and the society is desirous of
adding to its active membership mature
imaginative interested men and women
who believe whole-heartedly in the pos-
sibility of interplanetary travel and arc
willing to participate in the necessary
activities to promote the aims of the
society

  associate membership is open to those
who wish to partake of the benefits of
the society but who do not vote at its
meetings or have an active voice in its
affairs

 among our members we number dr
robert h goddard of clark university
dr clyde fisher of the american mu-
seum of natural history captain sir
hubert wilkins the noted explorer and
hugo gemsback

  the officers are david lasser

  we cannot speak too highly of the
efforts of this society to popularize and
promote the idea of interplanetary travel-

 the fourth dimension will
reconcile them
editor wonder stones quarterly
each new edition of your most inter-
esting quarterly is looked forward to with
great expectation by me but there is a
criticism i would voice for myself and
i believe many other present and would-
be readers

  science and religion have in the
known past kept at no mean distance
from each other by their contrary be-
liefs in evolution and the absolute we
have known that only something lovable
and in common would reconcile one to
the other

  in spite of the lack of understandable
material proof science and religion have
found that something

  a thought that there is an irresistible
plane within our own called the fourth
dimension has taken root in the re-
ligious mind religion knowing science
holds such a belief is beginning to realize
science is not entirely wrong in its work-
ings and may be able to give religion a
believable and technical explanation i
know science will succeed in this and
then will come a reconciliation of science
and religion that will bring more hap-
piness and wonders than material beings
have ever known happiness that will
abolish crime and disease wonders that
will belittle greatly the mechanical age
we know now

  now the great thing is happening and
you science know the divine thoughts
religion must have of this other plane
please do not spoil and retard the growth
of this great and beautiful alliance by
printing such grotesque stories as via
the hewitt ray by m j rupert why
cannot m j r help by writing the
beautiful type of story l lorraine wrote
titled into the th century

  i do not wish m j rupert or yoor-
self to derive from my letter that i am
a critic of the intelligence of miss rupert
or yourself i want to convey to you that
the fourth dimension belief has taken
stronger hold on the religious and sci-
entific hupian of this plane than has come
to the surface but is deeply imbedded in
the mind

  thirty centuries ago the great hindu
soldier-statesman voiced ideas of the
fourth dimension thirty centuries
later his beliefs are cropping up in the
minds of people who never heard of
bhismal is it coincidence or another
knock on the door of the brain by the
fourth dimension in an era of higher
apparent intelligence

  lets show our intelligence by giving
them a chance at proof if not true what
a beautiful thought that will leave us
none the worse if true-

              mr clifford w ritch
              co richards  co
              stamford conn

  although we can appreciate our cor-
respondents point of view about the rec-
onciliation of science and religion by
means of the fourth dimension-we do
not quite see how miss rupert has re-
tarded any such understanding we
lieve that all truth should be able 
stand on its own legs and that the rec
onciliation should not flinch from a new

point of view miss rupert has simply
shown us three types of mankind in her
fourth dimensional world one type has
existed in the past one type still exists
for many students of our civilization
say we are ruled by women and one
type shows the future man miss rupert
is assuredly entitled to her own point of
view on what future man may be like
and it may be that miss lorraine did
not mean that the th century would
be as she pictured it but she showed
an ideal conception thereby pointing out
how far away from the ideal we are-
editor

there is no strain

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i wish to criticise your statement on
the table of contents page in the winter
quarterly which heads as follows
our cover illustration
depicts an exciting episode from otto
willi gails novel the shot into in-
finity

  here we sec the spaceship geryon
plunging towards the moon the moon
may be observed at the right-hand side
still a great distance away

  in the position shown the spaceship is
rushing ahead at a tremendous speed
yet it is possible for the adventurers to
venture outside the spaceship in airtight
and cold-insulated space-suits the men
are connected to the spaceship by lengths
of thin telephone wires by means of
which they can converse with each other
inasmuch as they are in the so-called
free-fall there is no strain on the light
telephone wires which they also use to
pull themselves back to the ship they
may also return to the ship by firing
pistols as is also shown in the opposite
direction to which they wish to travel
the best thing i do is criticise any of
my neighbors even my wife will tell
you that

  but just the same you say there is no
strain on the light telephone wires i
believe thats bunk at least as far as the
picture is concerned

  were this rocket falling freely and
then the men came out then your state-
ment would be true but the picture
shows the rocket firing propelling

 ac-

charges these charges would greatly 
celerate the rocket but would not do so

  re- i
  

on the men away to the side of the
rocket the result would be that the
rocket would jerk violently away break-
ing the wires and leaving the men float-
ing back behind in space

                         e l braley
                         cable wis

  let us explain what we mean when
we say that the adventurers can venture
outside the space-ship in airtight and
cold-insulated space-suits mr braley
probably refers to the fact that the ship
is traveling at a tremendous speed now
inasmuch as there is no air resistance
and we assume no gravity there is no
force necessary to keep the ships moving
at their present speed therefore when
the space travelers step outside the ship
they already have the velocity of the ship
and as nothing interferes to lower that
velocity they will continue to float along
with the ship at an undiminished speed

  with regard to the second point of
the strain on the telephone wires our
statement is admittedly not altogether
clear what we mean was that there was
no strain on the telephone wires due to
the weight of the space travelers but
there is probably a slight strain due to
to force necessary to accelerate the trav-
elers toward the space-ships-editor

we would have more progress

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i have just been re-reading lilith lor-
raines into the th century in the
winter quarterly and i am more than
enthusiastic about it

  perhaps miss or mrs lorraine is
more of a philosopher than a scientist
but that is by  means a criticism if
we had more philosopher-scientists and
less of the other kind that havent im-
agination enough to realize that there
mav be a lot of things going on around
us that never affect any one of our five
senses and never produce any visible ef-
fect on the phenomenon which we call
matter perhaps we would have a more
genuine progress

  miss lorraines story gives us some
interesting thoughts on the most impor-
tant of all sciences the science of every
day human relations she seems to be
one of the all-too-few people who realize
that real lasting happiness can come only
when we have become masters of our-
selves and that it never can come through
greater indulgence in passion as judge
lindsey and some others would have us
believe

  our advances in the material sciences
are all very interesting but they can never
lead to anything but the destruction of
what little real civilization we have un-
less we put into practice more of the
principles of true brotherly love

  what a wonderful world this soon
would be if we all had lilith lorraines
clean lofty ideals about life if no man
woman or child had any reason to fear
any other human being on earth if any
child could look with absolute confidence
to any older person as a safe and re-
liable guide and counselor and yes if
any woman could go anywhere alone
with any man for any length of time
without it ever occurring to anyone that
their relations while together would be
any other than that of an affectionate
brother and sister unless they had for-
mally entered into an agreement to as-
sume the responsibilities of parenthood
of course not quite all of this is touched
on in miss lorraines story but that is
about what one would expect from the
kind of people which she pictures

  one of the principal features of every
story about the future should be the
authors ideas of what humanity of the
future ought to be like what we need
is higher ideals to aim at not pessimistic
prophecies of civilization going to the
bow wows

  many space travel stories are very in-
teresting but i often wonder why some
authors will chase their imaginations all
over the universe in search of a hu-
manity meaner and uglier than any of
us isnt it more profitable to dream
about beauty of character and form then
the reverse

  well this is my first contribution to
your waste basket and you may be glad
to know that i get spells like this only
at rare intervals

                    roy e kimball

                      box 

                    wecota s dak

  there is no doubt buf that lilith lor-
raine gives us something real and vital
in science fiction she makes us discon-
tented with what is ugly tawdry and
mean-she gives us new ideals and in
her stories a means of realizing them

  we really dont think that civilization
is going to the bowwows but we do 
not think that we can complacently trust
is not to go there if it is put to a test
we must depend on ourselves to save it

but our author accomplished it in

although he is not a pessimist dr

continued from page 

   a dash
to freedom-
fame and fortune

if we arc to cscape the dangers that lie
before us with our ever more compli-
cated existence we must face the truths
of our existence and then determine to
remedy them unfortunately it may not
be possible when civilization is tottering
to cscape by fourth dimensional means
to a new century

  but lilith lorraine docs gives us
something by which to judge our own
civilization she teaches us that there is
nothing inevitable about our world-that
it is not the best of all possible worlds
and with strength and will we can build
a newer and better one-editor

if the foreign authors are as
good

  editor wonder stories quarterly

  if all your stories by foreign authors
are as good as the stone from the
moon i hope to see many of them in
wonder stories quarterly elec-
tropolis sounds good is it i also liked
the ape cycle by clare winger
harris and via the hewitt ray by
m f rupert your women writers can
write good stories i hope you publish
more of their stories in future issues

  instead of having an all gold or silver
cover why not have just a border of that
color and have a picture with a different
colored background inside of this border
 think it would look much better

  are yon going to use the new type of
print in science wonder quarterly as
you do in the monthly i like it because
it does not blur as the type you are
using now sometimes does

jack darrow

               n spalding ave
              chicago 

  the suggestion about the cover is
gratefully accepted and will be consid-
ered all issues of the monthly and the
quarterly will have the larger type
that which we used originally we have
discovered that is what our readers want
and we are giving it to them-editor

the stone is valuable

editor wonder stories quarterly

  upon examination i find the stone
from the moon to be no ordinary stone
but a very precious and valuable one it
is composed of about  good and
logical science and  of interest of a
rare sort otto willi gail is an author
you certainly cant afford to lose paul
as usual illustrated the story in a very
convincing manner

  if possible i would like to see either
in the quarterly or wonder stories
monthly a list of the motion pictures
and plays which have a scientific back-
ground such as the two german pic-
tures metropolis and the woman
from the moon

  and now mr editor i would like your
opinion as to whether you think it is
possible on some other planet for in-
stance for a color not known on earth
to exist i do not mean some weird
shade but an absolutely new color which
can not be found on earth

                 forrest ackerman
                  staples ave

                    san francisco calif
we will try on mr ackermans sug-
gestion to compile a list of motion pic-
tures that have a scientific background
we will probably have something to re-
port by the next issue of the quarterly

  we are somewhat in doubt as to the
meaning of the question regarding a
new color we become aware of color
because a substance absorbs all light rays

except certain ones the one it does not
absorb it reflects to our eyes there-
fore when an object appears red to us
it means that of all the wavelengths of
the light it receives are absorbed except
red which is reflected to our eyes now
to have a new color we assume mr
ackerman means a new pure color it
would be necessary for our eyes to be able
to sec further into the spectrum that
they do or there would be necessary a
kind of light which when broken up
yields other combinations-or provides an
entirely different kind of spectrum

  or looking at it another way-objects
do not have color they reflect a certain
wave length absorbing all others our
eyes interpret that wave length reflected
to us as color now if our eyes were
constructed differently if wc had the eyes
to see radio waves or heat waves or
x-rays wc might see something un-
usual it might easily be that beings on
another world might have the type of
sensory apparatus that yields much dif-
ferent results than our own-editor

 osmotic theorem startling

editor wonder stories quarterly

  on finishing the winter is of the
quarterly i can say that r h ro-
mans moon conquerors is the great-
est story i have read barring none gail s
shot into infinity was good but a little

e inserting of the history of the
dunelians made the story invaluable as
it gave a new theory of the possible his-
tory of the earth

  the osmotic theorem was a little
startling it was of course only a theory
and personally i dont believe in it but
everyone is entitled to his opinion

                 john reibel

                  main street
dunkirk new york
although the osmotic theorem was
in direct contradiction to the general
theory held-in that it propounds the idea
that the interior of the earth is cold and
not hot-the theory has much to sustain
it at least the general idea that the
interior of the earth is hot is only a
guess and has absolutely no experimental
evidence in back of it our explorations
into the earth have been mere pin pricks
and tell us nothing about the vast physical
and chemical changes that have gone on
and will go on at the-earths core cap-
tain meek like so many of our authors
has served a great purpose in his story
by showing us that what is held to be
absolute truth in one generation may be
entirely upset in another and that we
must always hold an open mind about
the things of which we know nothing-
editor

will keep the supremacy

  editor wonder stories quarterly

  i was much impressed with mr ro-
mans second offering-his incomparable
moon conquerors in the winter quar-
terly i have read the publications you
have edited since the days of station
x but i can truthfully say that the
romsis story is unequalled by any you
have published such stories as well as
the conquerors by david h keller
a rescue from jupiter the human
termites and others are exactly what
your readers want and so long as you
continue to publish such stories your
magazines will keep the supremacy you
have established for them

   what mr clark says is quite ap-
 plicable a science fiction story fails of
 its purpose in our opinion and from
 what we have learned from the opinion
 of our readers unless there is a point or
 purpose to it such a purpose or lesson
