 his work is difficult but more adventurous than the blood-
 curdling deeds of the spanish main instead of meeting an
 early and violent death on some forgotten shore he gathers
 wealth and honor through his invaluable contributions to hu-
 manity alfred nobel the swedish chemist who invented
 dynamite made so many millions that the income alone from
 his bequests provides five  prizes every year for the
 advancement of science and peace c m hall the chemist
 who discovered how to manufacture aluminum made millions

 able process for recovering the waste from flue gases james
 gayley who showed how to save enormous losses in steel

if all the radio sets ive fooled
with in my time were piled on top
of each other theyd reach abwi
halfway to mars the tr-oubk with
me was that  thought i knew so
much about radio that i reov
didnt know the first thing t
thought radio was a plaything-
that was all i could see in it for me

  i thought radio was a plaything

but now my eyes are opened and
im making over  a week

    a week man alive just one year ago
 a salary that big would have been the height
 of my ambition

   twelve months ago i was scrimping along
 on starvation wages just barely making
 both ends meet it was the same old story-
 a little job a salary just as small as the job
 while i myself had been dragging along
 in the rut so long i couldnt see over the
 sides

   if youd told me a year ago that in twelve
 months time i would be making  and
 week in the radio business--
 wiew i know id have thought you were
 but thats the sort of money im pull-
 ing clown right now-and in the future i
  expect even more why only today-

   but im getting ahead of my story  was
 hard up a year ago because i was kidding
 myself thats all-not because i had to be
 i could have been holding then the same
 sort of job im holding now if id only been
 wise to myself if youve fooled around with
 radio but never thought of it as a serious
 business maybe youre in just the same boat
 i was if so youll want to read how my
 eyes were opened for me

   when broadcasting first bccame the rage
 several years ago i first began my dabbling
 with the new art of radio i was nuts
 about the subject like many thousands of
 other fellows all over the country and no
 wonder theres a fascination-something
 that grabs hold of a fellow-about twirling
 a little knob and suddenly listening to a
 voice speaking a thousand miles away
 twirling it a little more and listening to the
 mysterious dots and dashes of steamers far
 at sea even today i get a thrill from this
 strange force in those days many times i
 stayed up almost the whole night trying for
 dx many times i missed supper because
 i couldnt be dragged away from the latest
 circuit i was trying out

   i never seemed to get very far with it
 though i used to read the radio magazines
 and occasionally a radio book but i never
 understood the subject very clearly and lots
 of things i didnt see through at all

   so up to a year ago i was just a dabbler
 -i thought radio was a plaything i never
 realized what an enormous fast-growing in-
 dustry radio had come to be-employing
 thousands and thousands of trained men

p lease fa y

i usually stayed home in the evenings after
work because i didnt make enough money
to go out very much and generally during
the evening id tinker a little with radio-
a set of my own or some friends i even
made a little spare change this way which
helped a lot but i didnt know enough to
go very far with such work

  and as for the idea chat a splendid radio
job might be mine if i made a little effort
to prepare for it-such an idea never entered
my head when a friend suggested it to me
one year ago i laughed at him

  youre kidding me i said

  im not he replied take a look at
this ad

  he pointed to a page ad in a magazine
an advertisement id seen many times but
just passed up without thinking never
dreaming it applied to me this time i read
the ad carefully it told of many big oppor-
tunities for trained men to succeed in the
great new radio field with the advertise-
ment was a coupon offering a big free book
full of information i sent the coupon in
and in a few days received a handsome -
page book printed in two colors telling all
about the opportunities in the radio field
and how a man can prepare quickly and
easily at home to take advantage of these
opportunities well it was a revelation to
me i read the book carefully and when i
finished it i made my decision

  whats happened in the twelve months
since that day as ive already told you
seems almost like a dream to me now for
ten of those twelve months ive had a
radio business of my own at first of
course i started it as a little proposition
on the side under the guidance of the na-
tional radio institute the outfit that gave
me my radio training it wasnt long be-
fore i was getting so much to do in the
radio line that i quit my measly little cleri-
cal job and devoted my full time to my
radio business

  since that time ive gone right on up
always under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute they
would have given me just as much help too
if i had wanted to follow some other line
of radio besides building my own retail
business-such as broadcasting manufactur-
ing experimenting sea operating or any one
of the score of lines they prepare you for

you s a w it in amazing

and to think that until that day i sent for
their eye-opening book id been wailing i
never had a chance

  now im making as i told you before
over  a week and i know the future
holds even more for radio is one of the
most progressive fastest-growing businesses
in the world today and its work that i
like-work a man caln jtet interested in

  h resttip you truly not he as bad
off as i was bitr thrk it over-are you
satisfied are you nssuhigenough money
at work that you like would you sign a
contract to stay where you are now for the
next ten years-making the same money if
not youd better be doing something about
it instead of drifting

  this new radio game is a live-wire field
of golden rewards the work in any of the
 different lines of radio is fascinating
absorbing well paid the national radio
institute-oldest and largest radio bome-
study school in the world-will train you
inexpensively in your own home to know
radio from a to z and to increase your
earnings in the radio field

  take another tip-no matter what your
plans are no matter how much or how little
you know about radio-clip the coupon be-
low and look their free book over it is
filled with interesting facts figures and
photos and the information it will give you
is worth a few minutes of anybodys time

life the amazing puzzle

 by hugo gernsback

  fish swimming in his natural element water
  perhaps never pays any attention to his surround-
  ings taking the water entirely for granted as
  a matter of fact he probably does not know of
  such a question because having been in the
  water always he has become so accustomed to
  his life here that he has accepted it as a matter
  of course and of no concern to him
  i

    the human being growing up among other human beings and
  among other living creatures also becomes so accustomed to
  life all about him that he accepts it and no- longer pays any
  particular attention to it

    once in a while a philosopher breaks loose and begins to
  p question life in general and to ask why i life of course
  no satisfactory answer has ever come forth and probably none
  ever will be found

    but to the thinking student the thought must occur that
  anything alive whether it be human being animal or plant is
  exceedingly out of keeping with the rest of the universe it
  may be said definitely that life as we know it occurs only
  in extremely isolated instances and such sort of life amounts
  to so little that it is entirely negligible in relation to the rest of
  the universe

    take our own planet for instance if you investigate the
  subject you will find that all life in proportion to the planet
  itself amounts to practically nothing the overwhelming ma-
  jority of the planet is inert matter-atmosphere oceans contin-
  ents and the material that composes them it is the same
  throughout nature take the parent body for example the
  sun which is responsible for all life we know definitely that
  it is impossible for life as we know it to exist on the sun
  neither animals nor plants could live on the sun even for the
  merest fraction of a second

     practically all of our planets tell the same story jupiter by
  far the largest of all the planets-as large in fact as all the rest
  of the planets combined-is still in a plastic form it has not
  as yet cooled down we know for a certainty that life such as
  we encounter on this planet cannot exist on jupiter

    on the other hand we also know for a certainty that life
  will not always be existent upon our own planet indeed for

billions of years before life appeared on this planet it was en-
tirely barren of plant and animal life and if we take a lesson
from our own moon from mars and from other celestial bodies
we may predict with equal certainty that a time will come on
earth when life will again be non-existent

  indeed scientists tell us that this recurring change is no longer
a novelty on this planet this idea of a sort of cycle is sup-
ported by the famous english scientist soddy due to radium
action the earth continuallyget-hetter until finally ivwill
practically burn up then will come another period of cooling
when a crust will again form upon the earth rwmch time it
may be possible for life to inhabit the thin crust once more the
same as it does now how long these cycles last no one knows
in between there are the ice ages jas well as the other cycles
well known to geologists

  no one seems to be certain that life appears on this planet
after every general destruction as a matter of fact life itself
is a great puzzle to pure science and really unaccountable

  human beings in their arrogance and conceit are prone to
point out that it is the human mind which controls the world
but this is plain foolishness and means nothing it is simply hu-
man vain-gloriousness to assume so human life and all other
life as well is of no necessity to nature in general millions
of celestial bodies get along very nicely without life just the
same as our sun and other heavenly bodies do

  it pleases us and pleases our vanity to think how important we
are to this world yet when we consider the problem soberly
we must admit that the human being is and probably always
will be subservient to all natures forces whether they be
earthquakes tornadoes tidal waves stellar cataclysms or
what not

  the sun  miles away gives us what we are pleased
to call life without it we should perish as many other races
have doubtless perished countless times in the history of the
universe no matter what we do on earth and no matter how
grandiose our handiwork nothing will remain after the usual
geological cataclysm it is probably certain that civilizations
much higher than ours were present upon this globe many
times in the history of the earth yet nothing remains to show
what went on before and it will probably always be thus

author of the man with the strange head the appendix and the spectacles etc

she head of jiles heagey instructor in
mathematics was bent low over the sheets
of figures and becomingly close to it
leaned the curly-haired one of his fiancee
sheila mathers daughter of the head of
the mathematics department sheila was no mean
mathematician herself and had published some original
papers

  are you trying to tell me that this stuff makes
any sense she laughed shaking her head over the
stack of papers

  your father couldnt follow it either heagey
answered he used abusive language at me when i
showed it to him

  now dont be mean to my father some day youll
learn that under his blustering exterior he has a heart
of gold but what do these things mean and what did
you bring me in here for

  you have followed through einsteins equation
for the transformation of coordinates have you not
heagey explained well this is einsteins stuff only
ive carried it farther than he did

v it doesnt look the same- sheila shook her

had

   that is because i am using four coordinates the
most complicated existing equations with the three
coordinates x y and z and involving three equations
each with the variables

              yi zu
              x y z

x y  z 

require that you keep in mind nine equations at a
time that is a heavy bur-
den and relatively few men - -

are able to do it here i
have four coordinates w x
y and z and the vari-

ables             
    w x  y  zl 
   w x y- z 
   wj x y z  
   w x y     
 y ur well-known antlior again has taken ilie fourth
 dimension as the basis of another of his interesting
 tales hut this time he takes us to a world of wonders by
 an entirely different route the story certainly is highly
 absorbing and will be found to give abundant food for
 thought

    it contains a great many original points which we believe
  have never been touched upon before in a fourth dimen-
  sional story

and requiring that i carry in 

my mind sixteen equations

at one time that may seem impossible but ive drilled
myself at it for two years and gradually i was able to

go farther and farther

but there are other quantities here sheila in-
terrupted studying the paper intently that do not
belong in equations for the rotation of coordinates

they look like the integrals in electromagnetic equa-
tions	diack nanclle ot the switcjl
good for you heagey cried enthusiastically a few seconds and pullec  out again



that pretty little head has something  the inside
too that is just exactly what they are electromag-
netic integrals you see the rotation of coordinates
looks very pretty in theory but when you hook it up
with a little practical dynamics-dont you understand
yet 

  sheila stared at the young mathematician in question-
ing wonder

  sheila jewel youre just irresistible that way i
cant help it he gathered her in his arms and kissed
her face in a dozen places she pushed him away

  no more until you tell me what this is about i
mean it she stamped her foot but a merry smile
contradicted her stern frown

  youre just like your father when youre like that
he said taking up the papers again very simple lit-
tle conception he continued why be satisfied with
rotating coordinates on paper  herds a way to rotate
them in concrete physical reality

  listen now when you rotate two coordinates
through ninety degrees you have an ordinate where
there previously was an abscissa if you rotate three
coordinates through ninety degrees you can make
a vertical plane occupy a horizontal position now-
suppose you rotate four coordinates through forty-five
degrees you can then make a portion of space occujjs-
a new position outside of what we know as space and
we can bring intothis space of ours a portion of the

unknown space along the fourth coordinate-

  the fourth dimension gasped sheila

  there it is on paper but were going to do it in
reality there- pointing across the room-are the

 coils by means of which we

- can rotate some real spaoe

i want you to see the pre-
liminary trial as i do not
know just exactly what may
happen i am going to ro-
tate only a small portion to
begin with

  sheilas eyes gleamed
with excited comprehension

- call father in hes just

across the corridor-

not for the very first trial i want you to see that

alone after we know what it will do-

but it may be dangerous something may happen
you think it might injure the furniture or damage
the building for the preliminary trial i shall rotate it
only for an instant and turn it back instantly

she clung to his arm nervously while he grasped the
black handle of the switch-nd threw it down waited
wung among millions of small spherical bodies disposed irregularly in all directions about me even below they moved
gently back and forth in small arcs and there were large brown bodies   




amazing stories

they saw nothing there was a crash instantan-
eously loud and fading almost instantly to a dis-
tant muffled rumble and ceasing suddenly there was
a heavy thud and a pounding on the floor sheila gave
a little scream

  there in front of them was a rapidly moving object
it bounced up and down off the floor to a height of
three feet about once a second it did not have the
harmonic motion of a bouncing body however it
stopped abruptly up in the air and shot downward at
high speed hit the floor stopped a moment and shot
back upward then it stopped suddenly and hung in
the air it was about the size of a large watermelon
and looked for all the world like human skin smooth
uniform unbroken all around

  the two stared at it amazed heagey walked up
and touched it with the tip of a finger it grew smaller
and suddenly it decreased to about one-half its former
size retaining its surface smoothness and uniformity
unchanged

  it had felt soft and warm like human flesh

  now it was increasing in size again while they stared
gasping speechless at it when it stopped growing
suddenly it was the size of a big barrel with rounded
ends there was a bulging ridge around the middle on
each side of which was a dark-brown strap of some-
thing like leather the rest of it was just naked skin

  sheila and heagey stood rooted to the spot staring
at it and at each other what was the thing where
had it come from

  the thing began thumping up and down off the
-flaor again with great thudding shocks after a while
it desisted andfay it was a most uncouth hideous
looking thing a great lump of naked flesh with two
straps around it it looked for all the world like some
huge tumor in a medical museum or like some mon-
strosity of birth could it be alive

  both of them approached it cautiously heagey
pricked it with a pin the skin was tough and he jabbed
hard a drop of blood appeared

  then there was a terrible commotion the object
decreased in size to a small sphere like a baseball in
fact there were several baseball-sized lumps of flesh
all around just naked flesh they moved rapidly and
two of them were between him and sheila two or
three were on the far side of her he counted ten of
them altogether five of them closed swiftly around
her then she was gone

  her scream cut suddenly short still rang in his
ears and she was gone suddenly vanished from in
front of him he groped about feeling for her in the
empty air but there was nothing anywhere there lay
the watermelon-like lump of flesh that he had first seen
it was on the floor and lay quite still and she was
gone he held his head distractedly

  the door opened and professor mathers sheilas
father came in

  whats going on in here he demanded blinking
his eyes

  heagey stared blankly trying to think

  this thumping and screaming  the professor con-
tinued

  i think i begin to understand heagey began

  think you understand the professor shouted
what have you done to my daughter she doesnt
scream for nothing

  he caught sight of the ovoid lump of flesh he
turned pale and stopped as if frozen some terrible
thought crossed his mind connecting it with his daugh-
ter had some nefarious experiment turned her into
that thing

  whats that he snapped savagely

  somethings got to be done heagey said chiefly to
himself weve got to bring her back here im
afraid to manipulate the thing too many times the lord
only knows what else it may dip up

  the professor glared

  you sound like a first-rate maniac-depressive crazy
man-

  wait till i shut that thing up heagey said getting
a hold on himself and ill explain all i know about
this i was getting ready to try to rotate a dog out of
space and so i have a new strong dog-cage here

  he set the dog-cage down beside the lump of flesh
very gently very slowly he pushed it in his touch
recoiled at the warm soft feel of it but he got it into
the cage and locked the door then he set out a chair
for the professor but his hand shook for his mind was
on sheila

  he sat down facing the professor his back to the
cage suddenly the professors face fell and his eyes
stared ahead with a look of utter blankness heagey
whirled around and looked at his specimen it was
out of the cage

  there hadnt been a sound his eyes had not been
off it for ten seconds the cage was still locked there
it lay three feet away from the cage only it wasijmhe
same there were two pieces of it now longtcylin-
drical rounded at the ends like a couple of legs with-
out knees or feet heagey got up and unlocked the
cage noting that it required fifteen seconds he felt
around inside the cage with his hands but found noth-
ing

  after all he sighed it is very simple

the professor stared at him now thoroughly con-
vinced that he was crazy heagey explained about
his sixteen equations and how readily they interlocked
with the electromagnetic integrals and of how the very
simple application of any form of electromagnetic
energy would rotate four coordinates

  i wanted her to see the preliminary experiment i
used but little power on a small field just opened a
little trap-door into space so to speak there is only
one explanation for what has happened here i rotated
a portion of a fourth dimension and left a hole in
hyperspace for an instant just as if you rotate up a
portion of this floor there will be a hole left as
chance would have it just at that moment some inhabi-
tant of hyperspace came along and stumbled into it
and i swung back on him and caught him

  here he is stuck what we see and feel is a cross-
section of him a solid cross-section of that part of him
that is cut by our three-dimensional space see if i
the captured cross-section



stick my finger through this sheet of paper the two-
dimensional inhabitants on its surface will perceive only
a circle at first the nail occupies a portion of its cir-
cumference  as i push my finger on through the nail is
gone and folds and ridges appear and disappear if
my whole hand goes through the circle increases greatly
in size if they draw a circle around my finger and try
to imprison it i can withdraw it and stick it through
somewhere else and they cannot understand how it was
done-

  but what about sheila  where is she 

  heageys face dropped he had been full of interest
and exultation in his problem the reminder of her
was an icy shock

  there is only one possible conclusion he went on in
a dead voice the struggles of the fourth-dimensional
creature swept her out into hyperspace

  the professor sprang up and walked rapidly out of
the room there was something determined in his stride
he slammed the door heagey sat down and thought
somehow he must rescue sheila

  how could it be done should he try the rotation
again he had all the figures and could repeat it ac-
curately but that would not be at all certain to get
her back the captured fourth-dimensional creature
might get away heagey didnt want to lose him not
only that he wanted to study him but somehow he felt
that he must hang on to the only link with that world
where sheila was now lost

  the thought of its getting away worried him how
could he make sure that it would not escape he
reasoned back to the plane section of a three-dimen-
sional object enclosing it in a circle would do no
gwid- but if tied tightly with a circle of rope it
might be kept from moving up and down analogically
if he could get this thing into some sort of a tight bag
he might feel free to flip his trap-door once more ah
then came the brilliant idea

  he could sally out into hyperspace and look for
sheila

  he got the lump of flesh fastened up tight in a canvas
sack and lashed the other end of the stout rope with
which he tied it around a concrete pillar then the
door opened and two policemen walked in followed by
the professor he was urging them on there he
is grab him he seemed to say in attitude and gesture
though not in words

  a pang of alarm shot through heagey he was
needed right here to rescue sheila what would become
of her if they locked him up his mind as usual worked
quickly and logically in contradistinction to the pro-
fessors who seemed to have been thrown into an un-
reasoning rage by his daughters disappearance he
sprang to his switchboard and shouted

  stop

  something in his determined attitude alarmed the
policcmen his hand on the ominous-looking apparatus
might mean something they stopped

  whats this what do you want heagey de-
manded

  the professors torrents broke loose

  he murdered my daughter made away with her

ive got a warrant for his arrest nonsensical twaddle
about the fourth dimension prosecute him to the
limit thats what ill do been hanging around her
too much hes crazy throw him in jail make him
bring her back

  heagey laughed a desperate laugh which made the
other three more certain that he was a dangerous
maniac

  like throwing debtors into jail heagey derided
acidly fat chance of paying the debt then move
another step and ill throw the three of you into un-
known hyperspace

  they were all afraid of they knew not what heagey
outlined to them that he wanted to go out into hyper-
space and search for sheila but he would tie himself
on a rope fastened at this end and be wanted some-
one here at this end who was friendly to him to man-
age things he telephoned out for a rope and for two
of his students the policemen watched too puzzled to
know what to do the professor acquiesced more from
fear like a man at the point of a gun than because he
saw the reason of it

  the rope was delivered and the two students adkins
and beemer arrived they helped him fix a firm sling
around his shoulders waist and thighs the loose rope
was coiled up on the floor several hundred feet of it
and the other end tied to a concrete pillar there
was some amazed staring by the students at the writhing
thing in the canvas sack

  ill tell you about that later heagey said all the
powers and dials are set all you need to do is to
throw this switch and jerk it back at onst -afhfmstyott
do that and beemer you watch the rope when i
signal by jerking it six times adkins you throw the
switch again the same way

  that was all without another word adkins threw
the switch there was the same crash instantaneously
muffled and almost suddenly fading away as at a dis-
tance there was a momentary sensation of agitation
though nothing really moved

heage was gone the loose end of the rope that
had tied him lay on the floor it was certainly a
breathless thing the professor stared with a sort of
vacant expression on his face as though the solid
ground had suddenly dropped from beneath his feet it
dawned upon him that perhaps sheila had really dis-
appeared that way

  beemer picked up the end of the rope it was not an
end it merely looked that way there was a strong
tension on it in fact it soon began to slip through his
hands and coil after coil was drawn off the pile on the
floor and simply vanished for a while it stopped and
then went on unwinding

  the policemen gazed blankly they were unable to
understand what had happened the man they were to
arrest had suddenly melted from sight they mumblgd
astonished monosyllables to each other but they were
not as astonished as was professor mathers thev
did not grasp the enormity of what was going on as he
did it upset his whole mental universe he sat a while
and then paced nervously up and down the vast room


amazing stories

 he came and looked at the rope then he looked at
 the canvas sack the sack lay loose as though the con-
 tents had escaped he felt of it and found that it con-
 tained three soft baseball-sized objects he jumped
 back and shrank away from it the time seemed in-
 terminable he waited and waited

   uesides an occasional mumble between the policemen
 or a short exclamation from adkins or beetner there
 was  conversation beemer watched the rope closely
 there was a tense nervous strain created largely by the
 professors distracted movements then after what
 seemed hours though in reality less than one hour there
 were six short tugs  the rope adkins threw his
 switch and out of the crash and tremor heagey tumbled
 out on the floor all tangled up in coils of rope

   he was breathless haggard wild-eyed he lay for
 a moment on the floor panting then he sprang up
 and gazed fiercely wildly about he seemed sud-
 denly to perceive where he was an expression of re-
 lief came over his face he sighed deeply and sank
 down to a sitting position he looked exhausted his
 clothes were disarranged and ripped in some places
 and were covered with dust

   the five people looked at him in silent amazement
 he looked from one to the other of them it was a long
 time before he spoke

   good to be back here i can hardly believe im
 really back never again for me

   what about sheila where is she the professor
 demanded

   heagey recoiled as though from some shock he sank
 ruaic-ista-prof ound depression at hrst he had seemed
 a little happy to getback apparently sheila had been
 forcibly driven out of his mind for the time

   let me tell you about it he began slowly he
 seemed not to know just how to proceed that is if
 i can i dont even know how to tell it i know what it
 must feel like to go insane

   i heard the switch go down as i gave adkins the
 signal then it seemed like an elevator starting and
 that was all until i looked around

   i was sitting  something that looked like rock or
 cement not far from me was that barrel-like lump of
 flesh with the two straps around it just exactly as i
 had seen it in the laboratory and- then a row of
 shapes reaching into the dim blue distance the nearer
 ones seemed to be of concrete or cement youve heard
 me jeer at the crazy cubistic and futuristic designs
 on book wrappers and wall-paper well those are
 pleasant and harmonious compared with the dizzy
 jagged angles the irregular zig-zag shapes with peaks
 and slants and everything out of sense and reason ex-
 cept perspective perspective was still correct just
 a long straight row fading into the distance what in
 the world it could be i hadnt the faintest idea how-
 ever i gradually reasoned it out

   naturally since i am a three-dimensional organism
 i can only perceive three dimensions even out in hyper-
 space i can only see three dimensions what i saw
 must therefore be the spatial cross-section of some sort
 of buildings i couldnt see the entire buildings but
 merely the cross-section cut by the particular set of

 coordinates in which i was now it occurs to me that
 since that barrel-like thing looked exactly the same to
 me out there as it did in the room here i must have
 been in a space or set of coordinates parallel to the

ones we are in now

tmagine a two-dimensional being whose life had
a been confined to a sheet of paper and who could
only perceive in two dimensions suddenly turned loose
in a room he could only see one plane at a time
everything he saw would be cross-sections of things
as we know them wouldnt he go crazy i nearly
did

  i first started out to walk along beside the row of
rock-like shapes suddenly near me there appeared two
spheres of flesh just like this one we have here they
rapidly increased in size coalesced into a barrel-shaped
thing with a metal-web belt around the middle and
then dwindled quickly there were three or four smaller
gobs of stuff and then ten or a dozen little ones finally
an irregular blotchy melon-like thing which quickly
disappeared in fifteen seconds it had all materialized
and gone

  i was beginning to understand the stuff now merely
some inhabitant or creature of hyperspace going by
as he passed through my particular spatial plane i saw
successive cross-sections of him just as though my
body were passing through a plane say feet first first
there would be two irregular circles then a larger oval
the trunk with two circles the arms at the sides and
separate from it and so on until the top of the head
vanished as a small spot

  i followed down the line of buildings looking
around bizarre shapes appeared around me changjng
size and shape in the wildest dizziest most uifcouth
ways splitting into a dozen pieces and comingtogether
into large irregular chunks some seemed to be metal
or concrete some human flesh naked or clothed in a
few minutes my mind became accustomed to interpret-
ing this passage of fourth-dimensional things through
my plane and i studied them with interest then i
slipped and fell down down i whizzed for a while
and everything about me disappeared

  i found myself rolling and sitting up i looked
around again there was nothing- i still seemedto
be  cement or stone and in all directions it stretched
away endlessly into the distance it was the most dis-
concerting thing i had ever seen in my life i was
just a speck in a universe of cement pavement i began
to get panicky but controlled myself and started to
walk feeling the reassuring pull of the rope behind
me i walked nervously and saw nothing anywhere
evidently i had slipped off my former plane and got
ten into a new one the rope tightened suddenly per
haps i had reached the end of it it jerked me back-
wards and i swung dizzily my feet hanging loose

  i swung among millions of small spherical bodies
disposed irregularly in all directions about me even
below they moved gently back and forth in small arcs
and there were large brown bodies-

  why go through it all  i stumbled from one spatial
plane into another each seemed a totally different
the captured cross section



universe i couldnt get them correlated in my mind
into any kind of a consistent whole at all for a long
time i climbed over some huge metal framework i
ran into moving things that grew larger and disap-
peared i struggled through a jungle of some soft
green vegetable stuff just all of a sudden i made up
my mind that id never find sheila

  she might be within a foot of me all the time yet
f couldnt get to her because i couldnt see out of three
dimensions i yelled her name until i was hoarse and
my head throbbed but nothing happened i grew
panicky and decided  wanted to go back i pulled on
the rope and dragged myself toward the direction from
which it came sometimes i slid rapidly toward it at
others i could feel myself dragging my entire weight
with my arms then i could go no further pull as i
might it seemed like trying to reach an inch higher
than you really can i couldnt quite stretch that far
so i gave it six short tugs very quietly i tumbled
out here i havent seen sheila

  the professor was calm his face was set hard

  either youre telling the truth or youre insane as a
loon he said and his voice was puzzled and sincere
perhaps im crazy too im broad-minded enough to
admit that is possible ive got you charged with
murder but ill give you a chance what are you go-
ing to do about sheila 

  heageys eyes blazed

  you can go to hell with your chance he roared
i want sheila back worse than you do if anyone can
get her back it is myself if you interfere you simply
guarantee that shes lost thats all if you want to see
her again keep your hands off see i

the professor was a better man than his blustering
actions might lead one to think

  well im worried lie said shortly can i help
you any

  heagey never changed expression

  perhaps you can i may need more money than ive
got just now you can help me most by getting out
of here and taking everybody with you and letting me
think ive got an idea ill phone you when i want
something

  well remember youre charged with murder and
thcye will be a police guard around this place

  how great and yet how small men will be under try-
ing conditions

  heagey left alone sat and thought he jumped up
and ran his hands through his hair

  god think of it he gasped sheila out there
alone in that mad placc not even a rope

  he paced rapidly around the room then he seized
paper and pencil and began to draw he drew circles
and ellipsoids of different sizes and laid the drawings in
a row the professor came in an hour later and found
him at it

  how do you ever expect to find her that way  he
growled peevishly

  shut up heagey snapped his nerves tautened into
disrespect he swept up the papers with his hand and
crumpled them into the waste-basket no use cant

study four-dimensional stuff on a two-dimensional
plane say  he shouted roughly at the professor get
me a hundred pounds of modeling clay up here quick
as you can

  the professor trotted out after it without a word
much less with any understanding of what it was about

  do you think youll do it was his eager attitude
one moment and if you dont you go on trial for
murder he raved a moment later

  far into the night heagey worked with modeling-
clay moulding the forms that had appeared in the labor-
atory and some of those he had seen in hyperspace he
tried to recollcct the order in which the various shapes
had appeared to him and laid them in rows in that
order late into the night he modeled and arranged
and stared and studied near midnight the professor
poked his head in the door

  shes really gone he moaned she hasnt comc
home shes nowhere he turned on the haggard
heagey the policemcn are on the job so dont try
to get away but im offering five thousand dollars to
anyone who brings sheila back

  heagey snatched a few hours sleep on the floor in
the morning when the professor opened the door lie
was arranging clay balls and clubs into rows and staring
at them as soon as the professors head appeared he
shouted

  ive got it the biggest photographs you can get
of sheila head and full-length both and fast
hurry

  he now turned his attention to the object in the
canvas sack he untied the rope from the fourteen-
ounce duck tied the corners of the canvas together in-
serted a stout stick obtained by breaking the leg off a
chairand twisted it squeezing the small ball of flesh
unmercifully at first sight it was a cruel looking pro-
cedure but there was method in it the thing began
to jump back and forth excitedly he loosened the
bulk of his pressure but kept up a steady firm tension
his strength was sufficient to hold it fairly steady sud-
denly lie loosened all pressure the mass of flesh sud-
denly grew larger and the satisfied expression in
i-ieageys face showed that was what he was working
for just as when you push hard against someone and
then suddenly let go he falls toward you

  he persisted steadily along this line when the cross-
section increased in size he held it loosely patted it
gently and even talked soothingly as soon as it
started to decrease he screwed up his stick and bore-
down on it remorselessly for an hour he wrestled
then the professor entered with two  by  photo-
graphs taken out of frames

  wait shouted heagey peremptorily stand there
and hold em he twisted up his stick again held it
and loosened it and was rewarded by seeing the bar-
rel-shaped mass appear then two long cylindrical bod-
ies beside it covered -with metal-mesh

  whats your idea  the professor asked

  dont bother me heagey panted irritatedly and
dont move i might need you any minute

  finally the thing decreased in size again but this
time heagey seemed satisfied with it he removed tli
	amazing

canvas sack there was an irregular sphere the size
of a bucket over its surface were queer patches
glassy places and iridescent rainbow-like spots that
changed color and looked deep

  quick now the pictures

  heagey set up the pictures in front of the thing as if
to show them to it the professor stared at him as
he would at a silly child heagey suddenly hit himself
in the side of the head with his fist

  what a prize fool i keep on being a fool he
shouted he turned savagely on the professor

  get me the two best fellows out of the fine-arts
department quick sculptors

  if the professor thought heagey was crazy never-
theless some glimmer of hope of rescuing sheila lent
him willingness and speed of thinking he scolded
rapidly into the telephone for a few minutes repeating
the word emergency several times then he started
down the driveway taking a policeman with him

heagey was feverishly busy he seemed to be
bringing every object in the room that could be
conveniently carried to set before the unearthly speci-
men he had there he seemed to be showing it things
he acted for all the world like some ignorant super-
stitious savage bringing things to his god books
chairs hats and coats mathematical medals hammers
and wrenches one thing after another he held them up
in front of it for a while and tossed them aside on the
growing heap when the two sculptors arrived he
barked his directions at them and continued what
seemed his silly efforts to entertain the object in front
of him by showing it everything he could find at
least it remained quiet and unchanged

  the sculptors infected with his determination
worked rapidly first there was a model of a heavy
bulging man with his foot caught in a hole like a
coal-chute and held fast bv a square lid then from
the pictures a model of sheila considering the speed
with which it was made it was a wonderful thing
with her pointed chin and curly hair all true to life
then a rough model of heagey

  heagey set the models down in front of the irides-
cent patchy thing and played puppets with the models
went through a regular dramatic performance with
them the models of sheila and himself stood near
the man caught in the trap-door the imprisoned man
struggled and knocked sheila over and she rolled away
she fell down off the surface of the block to a lower
level the imprisoned man continued to struggle and
the model of heagey searched around but could not
get past the edge of the block

  then very impressively motioning toward the thing

stories

  

as though he really believed it was looking heagey
made the model of the imprisoned man lean overand
pick up sheila and hand her over to the model of him-
self the model of himself held on to sheila and raised
the trap-door that imprisoned the bulging man who
hopped out of the hole and hastened away that was
the little show that heagey put on with the yard-high
clay models

  the patchy sphere changed suddenly first it shrank
and then it swelled then there were three or four
things moving back and forth and suddenly there
stood sheila

  pale and distracted and wan she looked and she
swayed as she looked blankly around then her eyes
widened and she gave a little scream but a look of
peace and content spread over her features by the
time heagey was at her side she fell limply into his
arms

  one moment dear lie said gently as he laid her
down carefully in the arm-chair the professor was
down on the floor beside her in a moment watching her
fluitering eyelids

  dad she breathed im all right

  heagey stepped quickly to his switches and threw
the big one in and out again again came the crash
cut short and the sensation of movement and the
thing was gone there was nothing left of it at all

  did you let the thing go the professor reproved
querulously

  i had to heagey snapped it was a promise-for
finding sheila

  the professor was sitting on the floor writing a
check

  do you think you deserve this  he said testily he
was merely trying to hide his emotion you wont
get it until you prove it explain how you did this

  heagey dropped into a chair looking exhausted to
the limit

  i reasoned from the things i saw out there that
this creature must be intelligent there were buildings
machines and leather and metal-webbing so i made
models and tried to deduce its shape somewhere on
it there must be a head and eyes you saw how i coaxed
it through this space of ours until the head was cut by
our space and the eyes could see us then i told it
what i wanted it to do with models-just as i would
explain things to you by means of drawings on a sheet
of paper

  now do you believe there are four dimensions
heagey demanded by way of vengeance

  ilm do you the professor countered

  four im convinced there are a dozen or a
thousand dimensions

amazing stories

quent words were carved and wrought into heraldic
grotesqueness holroyd tried to elucidate his religious
beliefs and-especially after whisky-lectured to him
against superstition and missionaries azuma-zi how-
ever shirked the discussion of his gods even though he
was kicked for it

  azuma-zi had come clad in white but insufficient
raiment out of the stoke-hole of the lord clive from
the straits settlements and beyond into london he
had heard even in his youth of the greatness and riches
of london where all the women are white and fair and
even the beggars in the streets are white and he had
arrived with newly-earned gold coins in his pocket
to worship at the shrine of civilization the day of his
landing was a dismal one the sky was dun and a
wind-worried drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets
but he plunged boldly into the delights of shadwell
and was presently cast up shattered in health civilized
in costume penniless and except in matters of the
direst necessity practically a dumb animal to toil for
james holroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo
shed at camberwell and to tames holroyd bullying
was a labor of love

  there were three dynamos with their engines at
camberwell the two that have been there since the
beginning are small machines the larger one was new
the smaller machines made a reasonable noise their
straps hummed over the drums every now and then
the brushes buzzed and fizzled and the air churned
steadily whoo whoo whoo between their poles
one was loose in its foundations and kept the shed
vibrating but the big dynamo drowned these little
noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron
core which somehow set part of the ironwork humming
the place made the visitors head reel with the throb
throb throb of the engines the rotation of the big
wheels the spinning ball-valves the occasional spittings
of the steam and over all the deep unceasing surging
note of the big dynamo this last noise was from an
engineering point of view a defect but azuma-zi
accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride

  if it were possible we would have the noises of that
shed always about the reader as he reads we would tell
all our story to such an accompaniment it was a
steady stream of din from which the ear picked out
first one- thread and then another there was the
intermittent snorting panting and seething of the
steam engines the suck and thud of their pistons the
dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great driving
wheels came round a note the leather straps made as
they ran tighter and looser and a fretful tumult from
the dynamos and over all sometimes inaudible as
the ear tired of it and then creeping back upon the
senses again was this trombone note of the big machine
the floor never felt steady and quiet beneath ones feet
but quivered and jarred it was a confusing unsteady
place and enough to send anyones thoughts jerking
into odd zigzags and for three months while the big
strike of the engineers was in progress holroyd who
was a blackleg and azuma-zi who was a mere black
were never out of the stir and eddy of it but slept and
fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed and

the gates

  holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text
of his big machine soon after azuma-zi came he had
to shout to be heard in the din look at that said
holroyd wheres your eathen idol to match ini
and azuma-zi looked for a moment holroyd was
inaudible and then azuma-zi heard kill a hundred
men twelve per cent on the ordinary shares said
holroyd and thats something like a gord

  holroyd was proud of his big dynamo and expatiated
upon its size and power to azuma-zi until heaven knows
what odd currents of thought that and the incessant
whirling and shindy set up within the curly black
cranium he would explain in the most graphic manner
the dozen or so ways in which a man might be killed by
it and once he gave azuma-zi a shock as a sample of
its quality after that in the breathing-times of his
labor-it was heavy laboir being not only his own
but most of holroyds-azuma-zi would sit and watch
the big machine now and then the brushes would
sparkle and spit blue flashes at which holroyd would
swear but all the rest was as smooth and rythmic as
breathing the band ran shooting over the shaft and
ever behind one as one watched was the complacent
thud of the piston so it lived all day in this big airy
shed with him and holroyd to wait upon it not pris-
oned up and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines
he knew-mere captive devils of the british solomon-
had been but a machine enthroned those two smaller
dynamos azuma-zi by force of contrast despised the
large one he privately christened the lord of the
dynamos they were fretful and irregular but the big
dynamo was steady how great it was how serene and
easy in its working greater and calmer even than the
buddhas he had seen at rangoon and yet not motion-
less but living the great black coils spun spun spun
the rings ran round under the brushes and the deep
note of its coil steadied the whole it affected azuma-zi
queerly

azuma-zi was not fond of labor he would sit
about and watch the lord of the dynamos while
holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get
whisky although his proper place was not in the dynamo
shed but behind the engines and moreover if holroyd
caught him skulking he got hit for it with a rod of stout
copper wire he would go and stand close to the
colossus and look up at the great leather band running
overhead there was a black patch on the band that
came round and it pleased him somehow among all
the clatter to watch this return again and again odd
thoughts spun with the whirl of it scientific people
tell us that savages give souls to rocks and trees-and
a machine is a thousand times more alive than a rock
or a tree and azuma-zi was practically a savage still
the veneer of civilization lay no deeper than his slop
suit his bruises and the coal grime on his face and
hands his father before him had worshipped a me-
teoric stone kindred blood it may be had splashed the
broad wheels of juggernaut

  he took every opportunity holroyd gave him of
touching and handling the great dynamo that was
the lord of dynamos



fascinating him he polished and cleaned it until the
metal parts were blinding in the sun he felt a mysteri-
ous sense of service in doing this he would go up to
it and touch its spinning coils gently the gods he
had worshipped were all far away the people in
london hid their gods

  at last his dim feelings grew more distinct and took
shape in thoughts and at last in acts when he came
into the roaring shed one morning he salaamed to the
lord of the dynamos and then when holroyd was
away he went and whispered to the thundering machine
that he was its servant and prayed it to have pity on
him and save him from holroyd as he did so a rare
gleam of light came in through the open archway of the
throbbing machine-shed and the lord of the dynamos
as he whirled and roared was radiant with pale gold
then azuma-zi knew that his service was acceptable
to his lord after that he did not feel so lonely as he
had done and even when his work time was over
which was rare he loitered about the shed

  then the next time holroyd maltreated him azuma-
zi went presently to the lord of the dynamos and
whispered thou seest o my lord and the angry
whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him there-
after it appeared to him that whenever holroyd came
into the shed a different note came into the sounds of
the dynamo my lord bides his time said azuma-zi
to himself the iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe
and he waited and watched for the day of reckoning
one day there was evidence of short circuiting and
holroyd making an unwary examination-it was in
the afternoon-got a rather severe shock azuma-zi
from behind the engine saw him jump off and curse at
the peccant coil

  he is warned said azuma-zi to himself surely
my lord is very patient

  holroyd had at first initiated his nigger into such
elementary conceptions of the dynamos working as
would enable him to take temporary charge of the
shed in his absence but when he noticed the manner
in which azuma-zi hung about the monster he became
suspicious he dimly perceived his assistant was up
to something and connecting him with the anointing
of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one
place he issued ail edict shouted above the confusion
of the machinery dont ee go nigh that big dynamo
any more pooh-bah or all take thy skin off besides
if it pleased azuma-zi to be near the big machine it
was plain sense and decency to keep him away from it

  azuma-zi obeyed at the time but later he was caught
bowing before the lord of the dynamos at which
holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he turned
to go away as azuma-zi presently stood behind the
engine and glared at the back of the hated holroyd
the noises of the machinery took a new rhythm and
sounded like four words in his native tongue

  it is hard to say exactly what madness is i fancy
azuma-zi was mad the incessant din and whirl of
the dynamo shed may have churned up his little store
of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy at
last into something akin to frenzy at any rate when
the idea of making holroyd a sacrifice to the dynamo

fetich was thus suggested to him it filled him with a
strange tumult of exultant emotion

  that night the two men and their black- shadows
were alone in the shed together the shed was lit with
one big arc light that winked and flickered purple the
shadows lay black behind the dynamos the ball gover-
nors of the engines whirled from light to darkness and
their pistons beat loud and steady the world outside
seen through the open end of the shed seemed incredibly
dim and remote it seemed absolutely silent too
since the riot of the machinery drowned every external
sound far away was the black fence of the yard with
gray shadowy houses behind and above was the deep
blue sky and the pale little stars azuma-zi suddenly
walked across the center of the shed above which the
leather bands were running and went into the shadow
by the big dynamo holroyd heard a click and the
spin of the armature changed

  what are you dewin with that switch he bawled
in surprise haint i told you--

  then he saw the set expression of azuma-zis eyes
as the asiatic came out of the shadow towards him

  in another moment the two men were grappling
fiercely in front of the great dynamo

  you coffee-headed fool gasped holroyd with
a brown hand at his throat keep off those contact
rings in another moment he was tripped and reeling
back upon the lord of the dynamos he instinctively
loosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself
from the machine

the messenger sent in furious haste from tne sw
tion to find out what had happened in the dynamo
shed met azuma-zi at the porters lodge by the gate
azuma-zi tried to explain something but the messenger
could make nothing of the blacks incoherent english
and hurried  to the shed the machines were 
noisily at work and nothing seemed to be disarranged
there was however a queer smell of singed hair then
he saw an odd-looking crumpled mass clinging to the
front of the big dynamo and approaching recognized
the distorted remains of holroyd

  the man stared and hesitated a moment then
he saw the face and shut his eyes convulsively he
turned on his heel before he opened them so that he
should not see holroyd again and went out of the shed
to get advice and help

  when azuma-zi saw holroyd die in the grip of the
great dynamo he had been a little scared about the
consequences of his act yet he felt strangely elated
and knew that the favor of the lord dynamo was
upon him his plan was already settled when he met
the man coming from the station and the scientific
manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at
the obvious conclusion of suicide this expert scarcely
noticed azuma-zi except to ask a few questions did
he see holroyd kill himself azuma-zi explained he
had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he
heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo it
was not a difficult examination being untinctured by
suspicion

  the distorted remains of holroyd which the electri-


amazing stories

cian removed from the machine were hastily covered by
the porter with a coffee-stained table-cloth some-
body by a happy inspiration fetched a medical man
the expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at
work again for seven or eight trains had stopped mid-
way in the stuffy tunnels of the electric railway azuma-
zi answering or misunderstanding the questions of the
people who had by authority or impudence come into
the shed was presently sent back to the stoke-hole
by the scientific manager of course a crowd collected
outside the gates of the yard-a crowd for no known
reason always hovers for a day or two near the scene
of a sudden death in london-two or three reporters
percolated somehow into the engine-slied and one even
got to azuma-zi but the scientific expert cleared them
out again being himself an amateur journalist

  presently the body was carried away and public
interest departed with it azuma-zi remained very
quietly at his furnace seeing over and over again in
the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became
still an hour after the murder to any one coming into
the shed it would have looked exactly as if nothing
remarkable had ever happened there peeping presently
from his engine-room the black saw the lord dynamo
spin and whirl beside his little brothers and the driving
wheels were beating round and the beating engines
went thud thud exactly as it had been earlier in the
evening after all from the mechanical point of view
it had been a most insignificant incident-the mere
temporary deflection of a current but now the slender

form and slender shadow of the scientific manager
replaced the sturdy outline of holroyd traveling up
and down the lane of light upon the vibrating  floor
under the straps between the engines and the
dynamos

 have i not served my lord said azuma-zi
inaudibly from his shadow and the note of the great
dynamo rang out full and clear as he looked at the
big whirly mechanism the strange fascination of ft
that had been a little in abeyance since holroyds death
resumed its sway

  never had azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and
pitilessly the big humming machine had slain its
victim without wavering for a second from its steady
beating it was indeed a mighty god

  the unconscious scientific manager stood with his
back to him scribbling on a piece of paper his shadow
lay at the foot of the monster

  was the lord dynamo still hungry his servant
was ready

  azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward then stopped
the scientific manager suddenly stopped writing and
walked down the shed to the endmost of the dynamos
and began to examine the brushes

  azuma-zi hesitated and then slipped across noise-
lessly into the shadow by the switch there he waited
presently the managers footsteps could be heard re-
turning he stopped in his old position unconscious
of the stoker crouching ten feet away from him then
the big dynamo suddenly fizzled and in another moment

vanguard of venus

magazine but we have arranged to give it
to our readers in attractive book form-
absolutely free turn to page
 and learn all about this big free
offer remember this is the only wax
that you will ever be able to read this
remarkable tale -
the lord of dynamos



azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him

  first the scientific manager was gripped round the
tiody and swung towards the big dynamo then kicking
with his knees and forcing his antagonists head down
with his hands he loosened the grip on his waist and
swung round away from the machine then the black
grasped him again putting a curly head against his
chest and they swayed and panted as jt seemed for an
age or so then the scientific manager was impelled
to catch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously
the black yelled hideously

  they rolled over on the floor and the black who had
apparently slipped from the vice of the teeth or parted
with some ear-the scientific manager wondered which
at the time-tried to throttle him the scientific
manager was making some ineffectual efforts to claw
something with his hands and to kick when the wel-
come sound of quick footsteps sounded on the floor
the next moment azuma-zi had left him and darted
towards the big dynamo there was a splutter amid
the roar

  the officer of the company who had entered stood
staring as azuma-zi caught the naked terminals in his
hands gave one horrible convulsion and then hung

motionless from the machine his face violently dis-
torted

  im jolly glad you came in when you did said
the scientific manager still sitting on the floor

  fie looked at the still quivering figure it is not a
nice death to die apparently-but it is quick

  the official was still staring at the body he was a
man of slow apprehension

  there was a pause

  the scientific manager got up on his feet rather
awkwardly he ran his fingers along his collar thought-
fully and moved his head to and fro several times

  poor holroyd  i see now then almost mechani-
cally he went towards the switch in the shadow and
turned the current into the railway circuit again as
he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the
machine and fell forward oil its face the core of the
dynamo roared out loud and clear and the armature
beat the air

so ended prematurely the worship of the dynamo
deity perhaps the most short-lived of all religions
yet withal it could at least boast a martyrdom and a
human sacrifice

                        what went before

 qftepiien reynard dunraven retired streefcar
  magnate and amateur paleontologist during one of his
 numerous expeditions in northern mexico discovers
among the indian aztec ruins there some inscribed tablets
which finally deciphered give ziarning to the world of another
glacial period after much study and research and mathe-
matical calculation the retired millionaire finds that the impend-
ing danger is very close because the earth zvas even then
approaching the frigid region of interstellar space

  naturally almost every scientific journal and nezvs paper
ignores dunravens findings except to pooh-pooh or ridicule
them and him

  bernard ilmore btdger editor-in-chief of the scientific
news arrives at the point zthere he begins to believe there
might be something to the old mans ravings after all and sends
his best correspondent bender to intcrviezv dunraven bender
has easy access to the irate amateur scientists home on account
of the existing friendship belzveen him and clara dunravens
only daughter

  not very long after the intcrviezv belief in the coming
danger is forced on the world for the advancing sheets of
ice from both poles moving tozvard the equator begin their

work of destruction with startling speed nezvs from copen-
hagen apprises the zvorld that their arctic zvinter is being
unduly ushered in though it is only june europe and asia
and the hudson bay vicinity are heard from next everybody

  bender as correspondent for the scientific nezvs must stay
on in new york until very near the bitter end dun-raven
and his daughter go back to the ruins in mexico when all he
can possibly do in nezv york is ended there in northern
mexico the amateur paleontologist plans to continue with his

  nezv york london and even italy are completely submerged
beneath the onrushing mountains of ice and still the glaciers
keep moving closer and closer to the tropics-which have now
become cool and habitable even san francisco has become

chapter ix continued

the world at bay

  do entered with hot tea and rum a fit
  beverage for such a cold climate

   ive hopes for the best continued my
host but of that later at present i have
something else for you and the readers of
the scientific news first we shall proceed to the
ruins next you shall wire enough to tampa to fill
a page or two of your magazine i hope old hillsboro
will be contrite enough to devote that much to the cause
of a very humble dilettante of science with a foolish
paleontological twist of mind paul is here and i will
endeavor to talk him into the notion of driving us over
to the digging which i must confess he is never over-
eager to do

   i trudged alongside of
him in silence and nodded
to paul as i took the back
seat of a mud beplastered
sedan of a more or less an-
cient vintage the corpu-
lent amateur-scientist sat
down heavily beside me
saying that a back seat was
more comfortable i smiled inwardly as i thought of
his fondness for me as a good listener

the sun was already reddening the western skyline

broken ill a hundred places by hog-back peaks when we
started for the huge excavation the trip would last
four or five hours and it would be dark by the time w-
arrived we must wait there overnight and only on
the morrow delve into the secrets of the mystery city
of the past

   stephen dunraven was a veritable fountain of words
to-day his topic was glaciers and he began to talk the
moment that paul threw in the cars clutch and a noisy
grating told that we were off i was a very interested
listener

   the first ice-ag he told me came many millions
of years ago during the long fiery youth of our little
globe the archeozoic which was bereft of all life
eons before the waters swarmed with life

   then came the second ice-age at the beginning of
the paleozoic when the world still had summers from
pole to pole as the fossil
corals found in the frigid
zones mutely tell us the
globe was vast swamp and
a vaster sea and sponges
jelly-fish and star-fish were
all alone in life land was
at a premium hence there
was no land-life

  and from then on each
geological era had an ice-age that lasted for a million
years and was divided into periods of glaciation as we
passed through the frigid belt only to pass through

 w f you have read the story thus far you must have become
  impressed zvith the fact that the author has taken extraor-
 dinary pains to make this an outstanding story as far as
 good scientific detail and cleverness in narration are con-
 cerned the closing part of the story is no less absorbing
 than zvhat has gone before and the solution offered by the
 author is no less impossible than the sixth glacier itself

 it is one of these exceedingly rare stories that ivill become
 better with time and zvill be spoken of in the years to come

amazing stories

if again in another one hundred some odd thousand
years thus five or six times during each ice-age the
glaciers from the two poles would come north and south
then would come eons when all would be iceless and
summer again as our little solar groups would vaga-
bond through spaces where no frigid belt played its
pranks and all the time our terrestrial orb was slowly
cooling off to make a home for humanity possible until
some day the fatal journey through the frigid belt
would come and mark a finis to it all drawing a cur-
tain of eternity on this short tragic drama of terrestrial
life

  immense coal-forests of cycads and giant forms
the sole vegetation of the carbonaceous period ab-
sorbed much of the carbon dioxide of the then thick
atmosphere of our earth and helped pave a way for
the ice and then when the glacier came these tender
trees died ages later upheavals covered and buried
them under the newer lands and to-day they are our
coal-mines yes the coal that you now burn in your
furnace was nothing more than carbon dioxide and
sunshine in the jurassic air

as there were immense forests in those days so too

  il there were immense beasts monstrous gargoyle-
visaged brainless behemoths such as opium eaters see
in opium dreams and then when the first cold days
came fast upon the heels of the warm and murky coal-
age they slew these dragons and made the existence of
man possible on the surface of the earth yes bender
i is a paradox but the ice ages had helped mankind
and its advent toward a civilized life by allowing only
the fittest to survive their terrible rigors nature slew
the giant beasts with whom the poor weaponless primi-
tive man would never have been able to compete
thinned the air for his tenderer lungs and destroyed the
huge miasmatic plants to make room for his forests and
plains then again the last ice-age socialized him the
primordial and savage one and made him gregarious
it was around the fires built for warmth and in the
caves sought for wind-breaks that home-life and clan-
life began in truth the glacier took the ape off the
tree-tops and setting him on his hind legs made a man
on the ground he had to use his brain and thus the
brain developed and in time the hunted one became the
hunter and the master of the world it was just
another way that nature had of keeping up the nobler
race that is just what the grand gardener is doing
to-day

  and yet the ice-ages grow severer and longer each
time this one is merely a foretaste of the endless
cold that is to come and which one day shall cover all
and leave our little globe a cold lifeless orb hurtling
through space our terrestrial divisions of tempera-
ture into torrid temperate and frigid zones are very
recent for it was only at the end of the cretaceous or
chalk period that these divisions began before that
all was summer the year round no i do not think
that we shall ever regain the temperatures of those
yestereons of yore cold days have followed each
ice-age and our little orb is steadily cooling down in
time an eternal winter shall take the place of the

eternal summer between which two our little span of
humanity is just a transitive period of springtime
weather

  a great average fall of temperature is not necessary
to an ice-age of course there is a sudden and enor-
mous drop as the first wall of ice hits heralded in by
the storm due to a mass of clouds that the ice is
pushing before it congealed particles of moisture in
the atmosphere i would not be one whit surprised to
find human beings even now alive on the jagged back
of the moving fields of ice maybe entire settlements
of overtaken fugitives which the glacier had spared for
a grimmer fate and would not release igloo villages
may have sprung up where cities once had stood this
is no impossibility

  a pretty dismal picture i interrupted with a sar-
donic smile anything else 

  oh yes one thing more a large part of the seas
solidify and thus there are no tides some even fear an
increase of the earths rotation because of the lack of
this tidal friction

chapter x
here stood a mighty city once

around the ruins a camp had sprung men
women and children were everywhere shifty-
k eyed scavengers with pinched faces were made
into human hyenas almost overnight and fearless beg-
gars lurked in the shadowy doorways of hovels or
walked stealthily in the slush of the narrow streets
whites dark peons and dark full-blooded indians
with tattered clothes elbowed one another on the noisy
narrow streets

  quite a mob paul remarked as he zig-zagged his
honking car through their midst and they gave way
reluctantly to the asthmatic sedan  i wish they
wouldnt clog up these narrow streets so much

  a quarter of an hour later we were challenged by a
dark-skinned rifleman and five minutes later we were
on our way into the earths interior

here stood a mighty city once now it was being
recaptured from time and decay with its chron-
icles of the dead eons it had braved the wrath of
time and decay the tall octagon-shaped tower which
the amateur scientist had so raved about stood there
a moulded pillar of reddish brown tall silent and aus-
tere like a captured prince among some tiny comrades

  everywhere before our eyes north east south and
west ran long straight narrow streets reminiscent of
chinese cities scantily clothed working men some
brown some white appeared like an army of busy ants
in the bottom of a huge pit ancient walls battered
by time and hoary with age saw their first daylight in
many a dark century as pick shovel and crowbar
brought them forth to vision beside me stood the
founder of it all stephen dunraven the avatist of d
napoleon and a scientific bedouin

  an old man advanced to meet us dust-covered
feeble of gait snow-white of heard a very old man
who appeared as if he long ago had forgotten to answer
the sixth glacier



the endless roll-call of time-a very imposing old man

  professor von moritz from munich paul was
whispering in my ear and a moment later the aged
savant confronted us panting like an asthmatic after
a severe spasm

  ach so it is you he chortled after a somewhat
lengthy scrutiny of the amateur paleontologist its
so good to see you his voice was cracked and very
low

  we shook hands his was a cracked and withered
hand like a tiny ancient parchment

  wonderful wonderful ejaculated the little ger-
man a lost city of the people who lived in the morn-
ing of the world

  i allowed my eyes to turn sideways and gaze at the
bulky figure of my host the amateur scientist and ex-
millionaire traction king who had lost his all a mon-
archs ransom under a mile of ice he was jubilant

  the diminutive scholar from munich was talking
what a strange world this is he philosophized in a
low squeaky tone what a strange world civilizations
upon civilizations first spiders and then men god
alone knows what was before the arachnidia

  spiders built this city bender the paleontologist
broke in abruptly huge spiders civilized arachnidia
they used us as their slaves or rather beasts of bur-
den of course by us i mean the early dawn man
the pithecanthropus who was more ape than man with
big teeth and little brain

  yes the professor is right civilizations over civi-
lizations-and who can truly say for how far back
rational mammalia to-day only a higher type of ape
rational bugs in a yester-eon rational what next 
nothing lasts in nature everything goes to make
room for others born of the already used material its
just like a man with a mass of clay he must destroy
the form lie just made before he can make another a
better one perhaps and so on ad infinitum why who
can say and like the fate of these spider people
our two-legged forms too shall go for man is by no
means the ne plus ultra of life and creation he is just
the beginning of something which our feeble minds
cannot comprehend

  these spiders were too weak to withstand the rig-
ors of the glacier very long though they did survive
long enough to record it and give posterity a warning
of a sixth catastrophe to come little did they realize
at that time the kind of posterity that would follow
and become humanized-almost ho-hum sic transit
gloria mundi thus passes away earthly glory just
as if our horses and mules a million years from now
were to become noble enough to erect cities and organ-
ize civilizations

  we had by now reached the base of the tall brick
tower labor of unwilling hands many years ago a
tousled-headed man in very dirty overalls came forward
to meet us

  mr brooks has been waiting for you all day yes-
terday he addressed stephen dunraven he says
that he is finished with the washing of the big iron tab-
let the one with the hole on top

  good boy frank ill find brooks soon he cant

be far away how about that sub-cellar is it clear

   all clear sir

  anything new

  no nothing

  and with this much the overalled one lingered a bit
but then upon seeing that no more attention was being
paid to him he turned around and walked away

mr brooks turned out to be a tall thin wry-
faced individual and the possessor of a rather
shrill voice he wore a much-abused leather jerkin
like the kind used among the truck drivers and team-
sters his head was long and bald and his age must
certainly have hovered in the neighborhood of fifty
before the sixth glacier had driven him to the south
and safety he had been a professor of chemistry in a
large mid-western university

  archeology however was his pet hobby and he had
to his credit one or two brochures that dealt with the
civilizations of the ancient races he himself appeared
to be almost like a mummy that had suddenly been by
some kind of black magic miraculously brought back
to life he seemed to be fresh from the case at
present he was in charge of a crew of laborers all of
them busy with rags chemicals and chisels bringing
forth to light and to knowledge the lore upon the metal-
lic and stone pages of the history books of the spider
peoples whose culture had once upon a time lingered
here

  morning folks was the way in which he greeted
us then turning toward stephen dimravch -its
done

  good where is it

  right here ill lead the way and with that he
moved ahead of us with almost elephantine dignity
such a contrast to his worn cowhide vest

  engraved on a huge plate of iron was the picture
of a spider he was performing some sort of rite
on a low altar upon which lay a monkey-visaged man
he was not the kind of a spider that you or i would
have expected to see imagine if you can a fiat oval
body almost human in its upright position standing
erect on four long thin legs a grotesque head was
popped almost neckless upon this oval ball a gargoyle
head out of a hashish-eaters dream a series of huge
eyes argus-like a blunt nose a cavernous gargan-
tuan mouth and a pair of long delicate mandibles were
all parts of his head four long arms as long and as
slender as were the legs protruding from the oval be-
neath the head judging by the sacrificed troglodyte
the spider must have been at least three feet tall a
smooth-skinned arachnid at one time natures highest
creation on our little orb

  funny little fellow with that big body and that
tiny head wonder what he ever did to get that big
half-man half-monkey brute to obey him it was
pauls voice

  brains brains answered the little teuton scholar
hastily brains my dear sir the ancient predecessor
of man lacked them he was more animal than he was
human just look at that frontal slope on his head
like an orang-utan eh  almost forty-five degrees


amazing stories

and these spiders they were of a noble race even if
only arachnidia astronomers mathematicians

  we never noticed the arrival of the newcomer a
short fat middle-aged mexican whose lighter com-
plexion showed him to be a caballero bereft of indian
or negroid blood his bearing was military as was
his tattered uniform he stopped short a few feet
from us clicked his heels together with a resounding
smack and saluted a few minutes of low conversa-
tion with stephen dunraven and he was leading our
little group away from the age-old ruins and out of
the buried city

it was evening the low uneven horizon of the west
was gory with a desert sunset from the arid hills
purple in the distance and the haze came the buzz of a
million refugees like disturbed hornets around their
nest and then the moon arose and the stars came out
and the landscape below was caught in an atmosphere
of pale light like a wisp of hazy smoke from an un-
seen fire a cloudlet floated across the sea of ink above
us radiant in the golden glow of the full moon for the
moon shines golden on the desert we were driving
home and the cold wind added no comfort to the ride

  only one way stephen dunraven was saying in
english to the fat mexican official heat her up
good and plenty ive got a scheme have it already
figured out on black and white in my tent step on
it a bit paul well soon be there and then over hot
coffee out of tin cups ido had learned to make ex-
cellent coffee well talk things over

it was four hours later stephen dunraven was
talking the scene was the crowded interior-of his
ancient khaki tent

  yes gentlemen the world is at bay all of us
are away well have to tear down these artificial bar-
riers of creed caste and nationality and fight nature
the one real foe here he slammed a walrus-flapper
of a hand heavily down on some blueprints almost up-
setting four cups of coffee are the plans of a jetty
a jetty that shall make history and have much to say
and do when the time comes to fight the ice what
i propose gentlemen is that we erect a number of huge
sea walls anywhere along the african and south amer-
ican coasts where the warm equatorial ocean currents
gather their torrid waters on their journey to the north
it was this same current returning from the frigid
ice-infected seas around the pole laden with the chill-
ing waters of the arctic ocean that gave our own
atlantic seaboard a land on one level with india snows
in the winter and frosts in the fall and during the late
springtimes when the northlands thawed it brought
along on its crest as it returned to the south again the
huge bergs of ice which proved a nemesis to many a
noble ship and this gulf stream still flows gentle-
men  it still flows under the ice it still continues to
bring down the colder waters fron beyond the arctic
circle and return to the pole with what little warm
water the tropics can yield now that is the reason
why london far above the latitude of new york city
received the blast of cold only a little while before the

huge american metropolis did that was also the rea-
son why the aerial observers with whom i am even
now in touch are able to report a concave dent in the
huge sea of ice-hills that only a few months ago were
the north atlantic ocean here the warm current of
the northward-bound gulf stream pushes itself into the
gigantic wall of ice

  and there are water currents just like this one ill
the atlantic ocean south of us and in the pacific oil
the other side my proposition then would be to build
a series of jetties of huge sea-walls and with each of
these walls a very powerful electric heating appliance
of some kind to heat the current as it goes north and
so on in relays more and more as the ice gives way
and then watch out for the icebergs heading south and
the flooded lowlands a central african jetty will
swerve the huge equatorial current which is caused by
trade winds from the east its boundaries are shifting
ones from its southeasterly course direct toward the
north where it will conjoin with our own gulf stream
which in truth is a part of it and receiving warm-
overs from a string of smaller jetties and their electric
heaters will finally reach the big jetty or sea-wall near
cuba which then will tend to swerve it nearer to our
own atlantic coast as it journeys toward europe only
to turn again in the far north and come south frigid
and frost-laden from labrador i recognize the mag-
nitude gentlemen of this monstrous undertaking which
will require men money and time galore of course
as we stand to-day the ice has practically stopped and
the jaws of the vice are still many miles apart never-
theless it is still here and who can say how long it will
stay when the interstellar zone of frigidity shall be
passed through the world is at bay it is our one
chance to strike

  with all attention on the speaker who in his enthu-
siasm had risen to his feet we had allowed our coffee
to become cold his words had brought us a newer
springtime a newer dawn in my minds eve i was
building jetties huge sea walls everywhere and the
tropical currents superheated in relays by huge electric
coils went north tore asunder the hills of ice and snow
sending down as proofs the gigantic bergs of ice and
reclaimed again the homes of mankind

chapter xi
the building of the jetty

los angeles met its fate an empty city on the
first day of the new year it required five whole
days for the wall of ice to pass from one end of
the californian metropolis to the other  longer a
fifty feet high advance guard of the glacier relentless
irresistible but a slow river of ice that had wasted all
of its fury in the dreadful deeds of the past it came
very slowly and failed to crush the biggest of the build-
ings and covered but slightly the west coast citys de-
serted streets the sixth glacier had already spent it-
self and could go no further it stood defiant on a
pair of twenty thousand mile long battle lines a mile
deep and with a jagged icy army of reserves at its
back and now it was mans turn to strike
the sixth glacier



  of conrsc the jetties would be but temporary-a
much-needed relief until the last outer fringe of the
frigid belt was passed the suns heat came down upon
us as strong as of yore and the ice receded to its polar
home then man would come into his own again
then too as the warm water currents could be only
on the oceans these and the coast lands alone would
be benefited the millions of square miles of inland
plateau high above the level of the sea would never
be affected and must remain realms of snow and ice a
waif of the boreal lords until the happy time would
come when the sun with its string of little balls shall be
in the icy grip of the frigid belt no longer

  the cities the towns and the hamlets that even now
lay crushed and scattered under the shroud of white
were to us lost forevermore when the ice will have
gone and left them uncovered to sunshine once more
only the stoutest of foundations would remain to show
where mankind fought with its back to the wall against
this icy lash of nature that spared neither young nor
old fifty centuries of toil are lost to us forever we
must start all over again gather the remnants that the
glacier spared and erect better houses out of the scat-
tered brick

  already happy wires were coming from everywhere
wherever the brave outpost watchmen of mans stand
before the glacier were posted that the ice had halted
on its marauding errands north and south the huge
jaws of the vise had failed to crush us completely
part of the world was safe at any rate and even if
the sun did shine down upon it through a frigid veil
and where sago and coco palm once flourished was now
the home of cold winds and frosty nights there was
ample space for every man woman and child to start
life all over again

  mexico city became the newest of world capitals
as buluwayo in the state of rhodesia equatorial
africa represented the headquarters of the peoples of
europe and javas swollen disease-infested main city
batavia became the capital of the heterogeneous castes
races and nations of the orient so the peoples of the
western hemisphere chose mexico city as the home of
their own temporary seat of government

  i dropped into it out of the sky one clear afternoon
only a day following the welcome news that stephen
dunravens versatile mind gave to an unhappy world
to make mens hearts glad with reborn hope a wait-
ing motor car took me from the airplane grounds and
brought me an emissary with glad tidings to the big
capitol building of the american confederacy where
the supervising triumvirate met me ten minutes later
i was expounding the happy news dunravens scheme
of the jetties the same day congress voted and
passed a bill a bill that made the state treasurer blink
his eyes for the building upkeep and manipulation
of any number of jetties or sea walls and their acces-
sory plants to be built in many parts of the world and
the powers-that-be on the other half of the globe gladly
cried aye to this vote telegrams burnt the wires
w-hilc wireless tore the ether with tidings of the happi-
est of messages that night mexico city was a bedlam
a jiappy madhouse of excited men women and chil-

dren who had suddenly realized that all hope need not
be abandoned after all

on the shores of gold coast in the central part of
mid-western africa where the deep and wide
equatorial current gathers much of its tropical waters
destined for more northern zones the first of the jetties
was started an offspring of the mind of a once rich
man who had given up the tinsel parts of life for the
more solid ones of science

  i left vera cruz an over-swollen port city on the
first workboat to go toward africa an erstwhile levia-
than ocean greyhound the mauretania formerly of the
cunard line to-day it was the unquestioned property
of the people of the world it takes mighty cataclysms
to do big deeds and even in the making and unmaking
of civilization and of worlds every dark cloud has its
silver lining

  three weeks went by on shipboard the maure-
tania was a heavy-laden and over-crowded vessel
though on it the hopes of a world rested it was bear-
ing to the battle front to open up the war-the van-
guard of the army that was to combat the glacier

  it was on board the big steamer that i made the ac-
quaintance of major reginal cummins u s a a
fatal acquaintance indeed to me the major was a
robust man tall and straight hitting on the decline side
of life long years in the uniform had given him a
ramrod back that was as straight as any pine that grew
in the woods and though a heavy man with the phy-
sique of a heavyweight prize-fighter he carried his two
hundred some odd pounds as a slender indian carries
his hundred and fifty an energetic egoist of a man
full of the vitality of animal magnetism brown-eyed
eager prematurely bald forever grinning a grin that
exposed an even row of very large buck teeth he re-
minded me of portraits i had seen of ex-president
roosevelt not exactly the man that one would choose
to lead neither was he a man to put at the tail end of
the ranks the clique of nations that made up the
american confederacy had seen fit to send him as a
representative to the forefront of the fight i went
along partly in the capacity of newspaperman and
partly as viceroy of the father of the scheme we soon
struck up an acquaintanceship it was difficult to
strike up a friendship with so vain a man

came the day when the pile-drivers sank the first
pillar into the ooze and sand four hundred and
eighty feet beneath the choppy icy surface of the sea
how the finny denizens of the deep must have won-
dered at this newest intrusion of their ancient pelagic
homes workingmen inside of huge metal rooms
veritable ten-men capacity diving bells were dropped
below the waves and from the safety of these undersea
workshops started the concrete foundations of this co-
lossal undertaking the building of the jetty upwards
and out of the sea rose the huge skeleton frameworks
of steel on their bases of stone the skeletal parts of
the gigantic sea wall that was to turn the current and
save the world for two months one hundred thou-
sand pairs of hands toiled day and night in eight-hour


amazing stories

shifts and one day a line of tall straight towers of
steel rose to an average of five hundred feet skyward
out of the oozy bottom of the sea at intervals of fifty
yards they were for over one hundred miles on the
oceans floor sometimes only fifty feet beneath the
crest of the waves and sometimes one thousand later
on these towers would be connected with huge girders
and these with stanchions erecting the skeleton frame-
work of the wall of solid concrete and reinforced by
steel one of the armies hurled against the icy foe

  dunraven came to view his brain-child when it was
but half grown merely a long line of steel towers jut-
ting for fifty feet out of the blue-green sea and on
and about them clustered men vessels big and little
and man-made islets that housed the workers and their
tools he brought clara along with him a jubilant
girlish clara who never minded my frayed overalls
and enjoyed my bewhiskered company in this anchored
city that was fighting desperately to recover from the
ice what it had stolen from the world

  that night it stormed with all the fury of an ocean
tempest yet there were four of us who sat unmindful
of it at the rickety table in my cabin stephen dun-
raven his daughter clara major cummins and my-
self a proud host over a supper of fish bread oleo-
margarine and tea the major was jubilant and the
corpulent amateur paleontologist only mirrored him
it will work im sure they kept repeating as if en-
couraging hopes that sought to stray supper over
came cigars the ubiquitous ido as taciturn as ever
superintending their distribution

  ive tried a little invention of my own said the
man upon whose scheme we were working we can
superheat with powerful coils the waters of rivers that
have their mouths at the regions inundated by the gla-
cier i endeavored to aid the battle of the jetties with
a land skirmish of my own thus far i have met with
only the most trivial of successes the heating of
course was done only on a small scale a mere experi-
ment but even then even a tyro could have foretold
that the heat would be dissipated by the cold atmos-
phere long before it reached the ice as there was no
warmer equatorial current to set it off

  at this point ido entered with a marconigram and
broke up our party stephen dunravenread the mes-
sage said a few words to the grinning major concern-
ing some shiploads of concrete and then they left to-
gether at the door he turned and remarked casually
it was twenty-two below in buenos aires yesterday
while rio de janeiro right under the equator has hit
the zero mark never mind the dishes clara ido will
take care of them a moment later clara and i were
alone

adversity gives one courage and hard times
make even the weakling bold i had experienced
adversity often in the last twelve months

  lets get married clara i said in an assumed
matter-of-fact tone as soon as the final echo of the
feet of the two men on the loose planks had died
away into the distance i knew that my anxious mien
belied my assumed tone but i enjoyed my own audacity

  she did not redden girls like clara never do be-
sides that the last twelve months had left a mark on
her too

  on what  she answered me with a question of her
own and in the same tone of voice that she would have
used had i asked her the time of day only a tinge of
elusiveness colored that tone and betrayed a more than
casual feeling

  on the ice i was trying to swerve it into a com-
ical channel and then more seriously the same on
wthich youd marry paul

  oh paul fiddlesticks a pause i joined the
red cross last month frank that is for active
service ambulance driving

  you do like paul 

  well

  do you

 why

  oh just so but do you

  ive no reason to hate him nor you either
  good little girl

  thanks for the pretty compliment

  how long do you expect to stay here 

  until the jetty is built i answered my own ques-
tion

  i dont know father is anxious to return to his
ruins in mexico he says that he has evidences of
other civilizations even before the spider people paul
is looking after it now-in a way he and that little
german professor herr-oh herr whatever his name
is

  oh pshaw let paul and little herr german pro-
fessor look after the spider ruins why should your
father waste his time there we the world need him
much more here id like to see him stay even if-
and me too she spoke softly and tittered but
never looked up from her shoes

  yes of course you too

  a silence followed neither one of us knew what
to say for i dared no longer speak the words i thought
ido entered with a huge dishpan in one hand and a tiny
mop in the other a miniature article on the model of
the kind that housewives use upon their floors came
the sound of tinware and of porcelain and of running
water clara was humming loves old sweet song
softly to herself i contemplated the frayed toes of
my boots for a long while but said nothing

  stephen dunraven much to my delight continued
to linger on major cummins more to my delight
became his constant companion clara and i saw more
and more of each other as the days slipped by and as
day by day the long jetty grew out of the seas bosom
a silent stationary monster of masonry and steel a
monster which wind and wave buffeted but which
never would give way

  the deluge of ice had stopped it had found its
battle-line dug-in as the soldier has it and though it
could advance no farther it would never relinquish an
inch all over the world on the three big oceans north
and south the nations were bending their backs over
gigantic sea walls of metal and stone set on the hriays
oozy bottom to send pole-ward the warm currents of 
the sixth glacier



water to meet the ice fang and claw the world was
fighting the ice and fighting hard

  on the opposite side of the globe the japs and the
chinese were bending under the burden of a series of
jetties that were to send the warmer water of the equa-
torial pacific scurrying into the regions of ice and snow

  in the bay of biscay europeans labored like mad-
men to swerve the warm current farther toward the
north

  on the coast of florida not far from jacksonville
a small jetty pushed inland the northbound waters of
the wide gulf stream that blue river in the green of
the ocean

  jetties everywhere rose out of the depths of the sea
as if by magic today the waves fell in unbroken in
huge crests capped with white and in deep hollow
troughs over an even sea to-morrow a long level
line of steel towers were to lift their skeleton heads
skyward out of it taller than the tallest of its waves a
while later came a wall a huge edifice of concrete for
an aladdins lamp had- been rubbed and a world was
working overtime

  nine months earlier the first diving bell descended
with its crew and sent word back that they had touched
the bottom of the sea and the concrete foundation of
the first pillar of steel was laid then four hundred and
eighty feet below the lowest valley of the waves the
current was turningiand the wanner waters were flow-
ing north to meet the ice and end the glaciers maraud-
ing career

it was one-half a year since the wall had been com-
pleted the first of the lot and already the big ice-
bergs were tearing themselves away from the main
-body and drifting southwards with the cold current
that came from the arctic circle under the surface of
the ocean in reality the gulf stream is a trio of
warm water streams about one hundred and seventy-
five miles wide with about fifty miles of cold water
ribbons between the three warm streams but now
thanks to the electric superheaters that received their
power via wireless from the huge dynamos at victoria
falls and the manufactured hot carbon-dioxide that
warmed the air above them they became one wide
stream of heated water and flowed with a daily speed
of five miles along the american atlantic coast and
then off toward the northeast and as the glacier
melted and receded smaller jetties some of them mere
anchored sea walls were swiftly erected at various ad-
vantageous points and each jetty comprised a series
of huge heating coils that kept warm the southern
waters and here and there artificially generated winds
kept them going on

  about forty miles of cold water separated the
gulf stream from the american coast and this cold
wall was pushed rudely aside by a number of smaller
sea walls anchored to the oceans floor this brought
the warmer waters so much nearer to the shore later
as the ice gradually melted and as it lessened along
wir coast more and more of these push-over jetties
were put up until just off sandy hook coast where the
great warm water stream-current turns northeast and

toward the coast of the european nations a huger
jetty was built to prevent the cold under water flow
of the arctic current from undoing the work of the
warm gulf stream then after the glacier had been
conquered and the resulting floods allowed it man
vanquished the ice still left on the high hinterlands
then man could start to rebuild his lost civilization 
a land bereft of everything

  so day bv day the huge ice wall retreated and as
it did so it sent down from its torn breast huge moun-
tains of ice multipeaked brilliant cathedrals resplen-
dent in the sun tall silent sentinels upholding the
azure of the sky the relics and fading monuments of
our former destroyer and conqueror

  one morning i arose early and peeked out of the
window where aurora on the rippling horizon of the
east had already made pink the skyline that had been
as ebony all through the night and merging sea and
sky into one had built a shimmering pathway of silver
on the crest of the waves a year had elapsed since
the first jetty had faithfully answered the hopes and
prayers of a waiting world now three hundred jet-
ties big and small lifted huge concrete backs out of
the deep it was only last night that a swift french
destroyer had landed me on the newest one of these
on the jersey coast and only a league away from the
high ice wall where the paean of victory was sung by
the warm current as the death-knell of the sixth gla-
cier rang through the air a hundred fathoms deep
the warm gulf stream was flowing and nearly two hun-
dred miles wide and it proved a terrible and unrelenting
nemesis to the ice that had held us for so long and
weary a time

  from hawaii now the main center of japan news
came that a certain army chemist named bendo had
invented a microscopic heat element which when put
into the sea transformed the current as it traveled with
it into an inter-oceanic river of steam thin wires
of silver in sets of twos were let down to the depth of
about five hundred feet and  the end of each was
suspended a perforated metal plate thick with a gluey
solution which in time threw off the hot electronic par-
ticles which flowed in a steady stream with the cur-
rent and keeping their heat for many miles made a
seething cauldron out of the current-streams of the
deep

  it was this that had from the very beginning proved
so dire a foe to the ice kings from the poles 
watched them often as they sent the superheated gulf
stream seething and foaming deep into the heart of
the ice fields and spreading an invisible blanket of
warmth over the land for five hundred miles inwards
from the coast

  electric heaters we quite properly named them and
we found them to be very effective also in combating
the ice-infested rivers which flowed toward the poles
as they melted the mile thickness of ice that lay over
the streams and sent floods everywhere they left a
bright chasm a mile deep and many miles wide as the
newest river bed with tall walls of ice rising on either
side

an so at last the ice gave way

and then came the floods oceans of water were
let loose the unfortunate ones near rivers and
 shores were trapped like rats in a swollen sewer
higher and higher rose the seas wherever bays were
narrow or coasts were low at times they even covered
the tops of jetties and as they went southwards they
inundated many beaches and often left behind them
huge hills of ice

  and not only did those lands which were nearest to
the melting wall of ice feel the damage of the flood
those which bordered the swollen rivers also were
affected beaten and kicking its last the sixth glacier
struck out at those whom it failed to get before

  italy was using volcanic heat and huge jets or
streams of hot water were uncovering lost lands on
that boot-shaped peninsula a one-time fortunate erup-
tion of vesuvius threw up large quantities of hot gases
and cut a large patch out of the ice-field that covered
naples the mediterranean sea was still one huge cake
of ice for the warmth of the current could not pass the
strait of gibraltar

happy was the world of fugitives who lived in the
torrid zone gradually coming into its own again
slowly the big walls of ice retreated northward and
southward here a jagged piece fell into the sea there
an overhanging mass dropped with a monstrous splash
and was carried toward the equator on the crest of the
waves and then one day when the warm air and
water spread and cut grooves into the ice-range entire
miles fell into the sea as if by the stroke of a magicians
wand newer cities were daily planned and newer
lands were divided among those who had lost every-
thing when the ice came from the poles even now
braving the terrors of the coastal floods families were
dropping into the relinquished lands slowly to be sure
but pioneers would never be pioneers if they came in
hordes or in vast multitudes

  famished nomads roamed the bleak interiors of the
ice-fields where cities and towns once had stood and
where millions once upon a time had lived toiled
played loved and died there these desperate creatures
from whom hunger and cold had taken the final vestiges
of civilization eked out a cruel existence by hunting
trapping fishing and robbing one another and when-
ever these methods failed a ghastly cannibalism took
their place of course many of these people eventually
found themselves in some outlying igloo village set on
the fringe of the halted glacier where the first of the
pioneers were awaiting the bugle-call to advance others
however merely wandered to and fro on the crest of the
glacier or finding a temporary nook safe from wind
and hunger erected homes of snow

  the broad prairies of the argentine the chilean
mexican and north african desert sand-wastes the
veldt of south africas spared regions the mountain-
ous countries of the andes cordilleras sierra madre
with the fertile vales and the swampy regions of the

tropical lowlands together with the south seas and
parts of asia were the havens of refuge of ten millions
the peoples of every tongue and clime started life
anew there on almost nothing and fought as only
the desperate can fight for their existence

  and then one day the sun came out reports from
several newer astronomical observatories reconstructed
from the salvaged material of the older ones had it
that safety and rescue were in view and that the outer
fringes of the vast interspacial belt of cold was not far
off and so at last the ice gave way

four weeks went by and with them went the end of
the frigid belt hundreds of gigantic icebergs
menaced the ships that were already carrying north-
ward those who had only three years ago fled in panic
before the ice and also the tiny newcomers who had
never experienced the ordeal of those dreadful days

  and as the ice melted the floods came and a second
deluge threatened the world its menace as terrible as
that of the icy flood that had preceded it rivers
became roaring cataracts that defied everything and
with the torrents came huge cakes of ice that jammed
at narrows and formed silvery dikes the mad waters
flooded the countryside for miles around airplane
bombs blew these ice walls into glittering oriental
smithereens that became rainbows as the powerful ex-
plosive hurled them -high into the air then side-
tracked waters receded back into their original tor-
mented beds the land was full of lakelets wherever
there was hollow ground

  the mississippi torn from its pre-glacial channels
by three years of moving ice proved to be a terrible
father of waters new orleans became a ghastly
death-trap to almost three million people early in the-
season of the big thaw one night the inhabitants were
told that there was no danger and then as the town
clocks chimed out the death knell of another day that
most dreadful of cries wrung the sleepers ears awake
awake the waters are rising the sun of the next
morning looked sadly down upon a demolished city and
its three million dead one vast graveyard that fifty feet
of flood water claimed as its own

  wide shallow torrents crisscrossed the deserts of
the southwest for the sands offered but the poorest of
river beds los angeles was flooded and san pedro
twenty miles away and by the sea was just swept away
sacramento became a veritable venice as the river
that coursed by it rose the remnants of san fran-
cisco which the glacier had spared were all swept away
into the sea the colorado river became one huge
lake covering four states and where the deep gorge of
the grand canyon impeded its way it became a raging
tearing fury of brown foamed with milky white a
demon of water the rio grande too became a lake
and on its bottom was el paso with only the hills of
fort bliss above the muddy water

  from where seattle once stood southeastward on a
more or less irregular line to the place where salt
lake city once was thence on a straight course to the
north rim of the grand canyon eastward from there
in a snaky line to the snow-capped rockies skirting
the sixth glacier



their sides only to orient itself toward the great lakes
and thence out to the atlantic was the newest line of
battle of the sixth glacier

  europe and asia was still covered north of the alps
and the balkans over the black sea where it formed a
low irregular wall and thence defied the sun on the
north side of the himalayas australia and africa
were entirely free though capetown sydney and mel-
bourne were no more tierra del fuego was still in
the glaciers grip

  somewhere a bit north of denver a city one mile
above the level of the sea and framed by many moun-
tain peaks was to be our new national capital and
though yet fast in the glaciers grasp the plans were
made and the men were ready

  new river courses found homes in the late desert
lands and the fertile soil washed down from hill and
stolen from arctic vale sent us sagebrush and manzan-
ita threefold as much as of yore on the banks of
rivers tules and arrow-weeds sprang up as if by
magic and all indications pointed toward verdant fields
where once only scrub-brush grew

  a score of cities with their outlying farm districts
grew like mushrooms overnight not huge cities of
towers and minarets but long straight avenues that
stretched across the flat lands or ran up and down the
hills treeless and barren homes of canvas of mud and
of stone lands were tilled and crops sown and peo-
ple lived anew on the northlands finest of soils brought
down by the glacier as the war indemnity of a con-
quered foe

  came thanksgiving day the last thursday in no-
vember of that happy year and the whole world made it
a day of joy although but one day was proclaimed
that day grew into one whole week

 it was at about this time that the pan-american
federafion of nations broke up broke up in bad blood
with one group demanding millions as rental debts
and another group just as impoverished moving out
and refusing to pay war for a while seemed imminent
but as there were no spoils for the victors the newest
of war-clouds drifted away amidst grumbling and
curses in such catastrophes the lands of the earth
are the possessions of no particular ones but of all who
seek shelter there

  greece was the first of europe to be freed italy
came next then spain and france together with the
lower balkans turkey had never been in the real grip
of the glacier and though it had suffered many boreal
days and months the land of the crescent and the scim-
itar never felt the icy grip from the pole that its
neighbors had persia was first cleared in asia and
in our own country maryland was the first state to free
itself of the sixth glacier

then one day war broke out in brazil a group
of huge national ghettoes had sprung up auto-
matically with the influx of north americans and euro-
peans lands were cleared and farms and houses were
erected hamlets became towns and sometimes cities
too much of hard labors offsprings to expect men to
give up without a struggle and yet the new fate-

driven settlers not only refused to become citizens of the
settled lands they refused to leave even when the
glacier retreated from their erstwhile homes in fact
they became distant colonists of a barren motherland
days of bloodshed followed skirmishes massacres bat-
tles while carcasses rotting beneath the tropical sky
fed the birds of the air and smouldering ash heaps held
reign where only a while ago towns had been finally
disease became the grand conqueror and germs proved
more terrible weapons than bayonets and bullets and
a train of sick and weary armies marched home un-
haloed and unsung

  of course many died in this grand exodus from a
refugees home but also many a one was born on that
northward march it was not like the mad stampede of
three years ago when a panic-stricken multitude tram-
pled the weak and left the sick behind the returning
armies came in more orderly fashion group by group
with tearful parting which smiles belied as one throng
received its orders to start singing poems of victory
they marched home defying the floods

chapter xiii
the people of the glacier

one day while at the new settlement of dttnra-
venia on the scarlet south rim of the grand
canyon the flap of my little tent was thrown
rudely to one side and clara ushered herself in with a
whirl of snow close behind her and grinning like a
huge cheshire cat was the big boyish major cummins
u s a little was said on any side clara was in a
hurry to go to the aid of some storm-stricken igloo vil-
lages in northern utah-the big major knew of nothing
to say as for me-my heart was too full for me to give
vent to my thoughts so we bowed to one another and
bid good-byes promising to meet again on some summer
day clara left a letter behind her and even before i
cut the flap of the envelope i recognized the almost
effeminate hand of the portly amateur of science whose
timely warning had saved so many lives clara gave
my hand a petulant squeeze which i wished could
linger on and she promised to call again as soon as her
red cross duties would allow paul she told me
had only recently arrived and then she lost herself in
the narrow confines of a rather diminutive aero-sedan
and even as she locked the door behind her my quick
eyes caught the sight of a glittering diamond on her left
hand which i knew well had not been there for very
long paul i said to myself half aloud youve won
congratulations old man and happy days but how in
the world did you do it  the age-old lament of the
beaten lover then a moment later i reflected what
is she gallivanting around with the old major for i
asked myself and echo answered feebly though oh
yes he too is going north to succor the hungry and
frozen ice-dwellers hes an army man however
i slept poorly that night

  paul came to see me at noon the next day a woe-
begone paul downcast and haggard to my half-
hearted congratulations he turned an askance mien
bosh was his momentary expression and a sickly


amazing stories

smile crossed his face then he continued in a chilling
 what-do-i-care tone of voice not me old boy he
said slowly im in the same boat with you con-
gratulate the right one though gone was my love
i slept a trifle sounder that night misery does love
company

  for two days dunravens missive had gone unread
mv mind was too full for scientific gossip strangely
the tie which a short while ago had held me so firmly
to the elder man was now somehow no more his
scientific rantings appeared  longer to hold an inter-
est for me and i found my idol to be of clay bah
i ejaculated peevishly as i sat partly dressed on the
edge of my cot what do i care about him and
his

  however i read the letter though hastily dunraven
predicted a world of involuntary vegetarians and later
years proved this to be too true the spider people of his
discovery had made use of poisoned arrows some of the
arrow-points having been found the aged german
savant had broken his foot while attempting to carry
a part of a very ancient cannon out of a very deep ex-
cavation a handle-less stone battle-ax more likely
than not of an eolithic era was also unearthed by the
sleepless bloodhounds of science reminiscent of the by-
gone glories of the ape-mans days it told how he
fought the spider race which conquered and enslaved
him with poisoned dart and iron shot that these so
very interesting creatures were fairly on their way to
hirl toward a kind of humanity is more or less ascer-
tained by the noticeable absence of any silk-sacs on the
pictures of themselves which they had left behind them
before relentless time claimed them their last pictures
that are growing in number with each stroke of the
pick the letter went on to say in part then followed a
very natural lament against the lack of any scientific
spirit in the new mexican government which was even
now casting an evil eye on the little yankee city that had
risen around the ruins the letter ended up with a
long tirade on the speculation of the government and
the social system of the spiders about their mode of
home life and whether they laid eggs or belonged to
some extinct order of ethnological mammalia of
clara nothing

  i sighed a very audible aw and threw the letter
into a corner of the tent the following day i made
ready for a trip to tampa

  those rivers which flowed toward the pole were
harnessed by the returning home-seekers to carry into
the heart of the frozen lands the great electrical heat
waves that melted the ice and as these worked only in
salt water an almost endless procession of salt trains
came from all directions of the compass on the newly
constructed narrow-gauge railways or by huge trucks
over the roads

  so rapid is the healthy recovery of nature that in
no more than one years time the tropics became the
tropics again and though palm and banyan did not
flourish until later the natives were already beginning
to forget those cold days which carried them off and
thick undergrowth came up almost overnight hearth
and home of noisy insect life were resumed and there

were huge ferns such as paleobotanical treatises allow
to the carbonaceous era in the days when most of our
coal was made they were as tall as trees and as lithe
as tules and as the ice-driven white settlers returned
to their nothern homes they left behind to the dark-
hued thick-lipped natives tilled acres and hastily built
villages relics of civilization as payment for the three
years of safety there just another chapter in the un-
written annals of civilization mankinds slow conquest
of nature in her fiercest of moods-mute ceaseless
struggles all unrecorded

  brown gray and mauve hills their broad backs
once covered with forests now carried tiny left-over
glaciers and their fertile valleys opulent with three
years of accumulation of northern soil were covered
with many feet of snow for a long time the lowlands
were soggy while the river valleys were constantly at
the mercy of newer and newer floods where gigantic
cities once upon a time had stood now to be located
only by latitude and longitude there were but flat ter-
rains or low rolling lands arid lifeless barren-mute
witnesses to show where the polar ice had crushed all as
it passed in its might yet if one dug in places deep
enough some bit of iron or stone would appear as a
reward a relic out of more orderly times which the
glacier had failed to carry off

   there was no wood for the reclaimed world was tree-
less and families had to start life all over again in
houses of mud and stone or in tents of canvas long
straight avenues bordered on each side by wind-flapped
tents or by sturdy adobe walls overlooked naked plains
or hilly countries that rose and fell away toward the
horizon surrounding them were patches of green that
seemed to bow before each breeze where the first buds
of the newly sown gifts of the soil had only a few days-
ago left their dark underground homes to taki their
first peep at the blue of the sky

those people who had braved the ice and defying
boreal days had played eskimo on the glaciers
back were glad to see the end of their game and their
igloo homes destroyed by the sun as the ice gave way
like savages they either roamed the unbounded ice-fields
or hid in the precarious safety of their little snow-
houses emerging only when hunger became the in-
centive there on the glaciers back they formed the
desperate vandal bands that knew no law but that of
self-preservation or became the quieter igloo-villagers
who hunted the polar bear and the arctic fox in order
to exist

   four years had already gone by since the first panic-
stricken refugee started for the south and by this time
the ice had already receded until only the lands north
of the canadian border were still in the glaciers grasp
there were still irregular patches of ice here and there
long arms of the mightiest of glaciers that projected
forth into the higher regions of the continent as if the
polar foe were reluctant to give back to man the land
that was his own in the mountainous districts of
colorado idaho wyoming and montana the sixth
glacier still stretched long icy arms and there remnants
of the polar demon still remained to tell of those terrible
the sixth glacier



days when pandemonium broke loose and reigned over
the world north of that all was still the glaciers own

  a squadron consisting of seven motor-sleds and their
huge lorries all of them overloaded with provisions
went to succor a group of survivors who for four years
had eked out a slim livelihood in the high mountain re-
gions of the yellowstone in the vicinity of the teton
basin this government train was overtaken and looted
by a gypsy band of famished snow-dwellers men and
women whom four years of hardship and deprivations
had returned to the cave ages upon report of this
newest outrage one of the many of its kind the gov-
ernment immediately dispatched a small fleet of fast
heavily armed motor-sleds accompanied by an esca-
drille of flying machinery to break up the boreal band-
itry that like the attacks of the redskins of old came
down in silence and stealth on the northernmost outpost
settlements even at his best man is but a short three-
hundred generations removed from the caves and a
hirsute large-tusked forbears ghost is with us yet and
an empty stomach understands no rules and regulations

  there was a battle during a snow-storm the strang-
est battle in history huge balls of snow that became
hugcr with each turn came down from the hill-tops
and buried part of our train in an avalanche machine
guns tear-bombs rifles grenades and aerial missiles
however soon routed the looters from their snowy fast-
nesses like covered beasts they fought the fur-clad
soldiers in ravines on slippery mountain-tops and the
prisoners that the soldiers could take were few as a
representative of a journal which was the first to decry
the coming terror i was allowed to interview them-
emaciated men and women of another eon-and in scat-
tered phrases learned the story of four years of terrible
life  the glaciers back

  they were landed a day later in a temporary camp
still a bit scared and wild busy with my camera i
failed to notice the arrival of half a dozen red cross
sleds and they left before i was able to see clara who
was among the red cross workers

  a day passed a day spent in motor-sledding back to
the site of the proposed new national capital washing-
tonia i directed my footsteps to the gigantic wood and
corrugated-tin edifice which housed the multitude of
wards of the emergency hospital a pompous middle-
aged chief orderly with the imperturbable air of a floor-
walker let me know in a brief sentence that neither
clara nor the contingent of red cross sleds to which
she belonged had as yet arrived then leaving me
rooted to the bare wooden floor of the building he
returned and strode majestically down the long cor-
ridor his heavy footsteps echoing throughout the spa-
cious place later one of the night nurses let me know
that although they were expecting the arrival of the
other red cross sleds at any moment not a few fears
were felt for the safety of the few men and women who
made up the personnel of the train of sleds a wireless
message from the military sled outfit with which i had
been and which even now was scouring the snow cov-
ered hills and valleys for any sign of the predatory
rovers on the glaciers back had given warning to all
of the outlying newly formed settlements to be on their

guard as hostile bands of crazed hunger-stricken men
and women those whom four long years of deprivation
after deprivation had hurled back into the antediluvian
eons and the days of the caves were outraging the coun-
tryside with looting and murder that night i slept
little

early the next morning the rising sun still below
the crimson of the eastern skyline major cum-
mins only partly dressed and very unmilitary-like in his
four days growth of bristling beard broke wildly into
my tent and between pantings of breath and accom-
panied by maniacal gesticulations each of which threat-
ened my clothing strung out on a line between the tent-
poles told me in excited words that clara had been
kidnapped by a horde of hungry igloo-villagers who
considered themselves neglected by the food distributing
committees she was now being held for ransom to
appease gnawing stomachs their terms were arbitrary
and the alternative too gruesome to relate fifteen
minutes later we were speeding northward as fast as a
propeller-driven motor-sled could take us at noon we
were searching the remains of what once had been a
red cross train of sleds night found us in the lower
regions of the mountainous teton basin south of yel-
lowstone national park still well within the chilly
grasp of the sixth glacier only the snow-laden tops
of the many tall peaks protruded above the world of ice
which seemed to encompass all as far as the eye was
able to see the next morning we were prisoners in
the hands of the starved villagers who had seen us
arrive and had awaited only darkness and the night to
pounce upon us

  that an unappeased hunger had brought cannibalism
upon these unfortunate people the many human bones
scattered about their snow dwellings told only too well
i pointed this out to the army man who immediately
turned pale beneath his stubby growth of beard we
must make terms with them-any terms they like was
all that he could find to say and then a couple of
minutes later my god my god i turned my head
and looked at him his huge head was lost in his pair
of huge fur-gloved hands cannibals he was say-
ing to himself as if there were no one close enough to
hear and weve only been married eleven days a
moment later he turned to me anxiety in both of his
wide-opened eyes but theyre after good food just
now and not human flesh isnt it so bender theyll
never eat her no never shes only a hostage to make
sure that we bring the grub well treat them right by
all means and promise to send up the chow-wagons right
away and theyll surely let her go dont you think so
sure my answer was almost an inarticulate uli
huh nearly a grunt for my chin had fallen and i felt
like a beaten dog relegated to the lowest limboes was
my final shred of hope and just like any other beaten
love-sick swain i was a silent morose man the
army had won again was the sole half-audible remark
i made after a half-hour of wicked thoughts before i
coiled up  my wolf-skin bed on the snow a moment
later i was in a dreamless slumber

  next day at noon inside of his igloo we stood face


amazing stories

	face with the chieftain of the hungry tribe a very
big and hirsute man wrapped in furs it was not
difficult to surmise that sheer strength and brutality had
given him a footing on the clans loftiest pedestal and
had kept him there and even now allowed him to hold
unqualified sway four young thin faced women hov-
ered sycophantly about him a quartette of fur-clad but-
terflies three be-whiskered men armed with- rifles
stood menacingly behind us the hungry clan leader
eyed me as the famished wolf would eye the well-fed
dog then for a brief instant his eyes rested on the
majors fur coat an army man eh he commented
with a leer that exposed a very irregular row of teeth
well old boy well army you here all right

  for our words of succor and food from the govern-
ment the burly men had complete contempt the
fact of the general helplessness in the face of the
glacier and the vast magnitude of the ice-fields never
seemed to have entered his mind he talked as a peevish
child might talk who had thought himself unjustly
wronged he never appeared to grasp the world-wide-
ness of the situation and answered only in an egocentric
way

  if the government is so bent upon feeding us then
why didnt it feed us all along we were here for four
years hungry all the time one by one we starved and
died and then because there was absolutely nothing else
to eat we ate the dead mere skin and bones they
were but we ate them my wife and my four kiddies
died the first year one after the other but what was
that to the big ones safe in the white house down in
washington they had plenty to eat im sure you
talk about the red cross well no red cross came
here in four long years they just allowed us to go
hungry and then you wonder why we steal anybody
will steal when hes hungry

  my arguments and explanations or rather my hasty
and puny efforts at such were futile for the man was
unable to grasp the vastness of the catastrophe and the
worlds helplessness before it it never entered his
mind that the very government which he thought had
neglected him so direfully had been non-existent during
all of the four years during which he went hungry i
endeavored to show him the wrong impressions that he
labored under but as every word of mine tended to
enrage him i realized the value of the ancient adage
that silence is golden

when we returned to our fur-floored prison of
snow the major became voluble again he feared
the teeth of these cannibal snow-dwellers for his young
bride he feared the harem of the burly leader more
i allowed him to talk on for about an hour or so when
in the steady outpour of his niagara of words he made
his one rational although unconscious remark

  i really do believe bender he said that-that big
fellow believes us to be on the square he really thinks
hell be fed and that we mean rescue but then theres
really something else in the wind back there once upon
a time you know he had nothing probably he was only
a day laborer or a farmer hes big enough now how-
ever hes king a real honest-to-goodness king and

his word is law he doesnt appear to be so starved to
me did you notice how they all jumped whenever he
spoke to them  i did a return to civilized ways once
more would mean to him the return of a king to the
farm and the plow or to the forge you know what
caesar answered the roman senate when they wanted
him to come back to rome and be second in command
its better to play first fiddle in iberia than second fid-
dle in bigger rome this man seems to think so too
a life of comparative ease now anything obtainable
at his command im sure that he never went hungry
and did you see his wives  i wonder if he intends to
include clara in his harem

  in answer i smiled an almost demoniacal smile a
blighted lover even at his best is but a poor companion
and he is of very much less value when the victor is at
his side

  we received no food i recalled the human bones
which i had seen scattered about the camp and my
hunger was appeased the major however felt other-
wise he cursed them volubly and in no uncertain
terms and told me many stories of savages who fed
their captives

  maybe they wanted to fatten them i answered
grimly but he merely contemplated me with a peculiar
glance and made no remark in return

  late that evening we heard a scattered series of
shots coming from the direction of the village shots
that the mountains roared back at the sky five
minutes passed riotously then the tumult and shouting
died away a minute later our three armed guards
fired twice apiece and then were lost beneath a pile of
waving arms and legs a couple of fur-clad bodies hug-
ging closely the snow that was even then swiftly be-
coming dyed a gruesome scarlet showed where two of
the guardsmens bullets had hit their mark shouts of
home again and of lets go back reached our ears
from the main part of the igloo settlement a sudden
revolt pent up by many cruel days had burst forth
and the big fur-clad king was dead his kingdom gone
and his adhering sycophants scattered to the winds
too many lean days had driven these men and women
who had known better times to desperation and a de-
sire to return to the civilized life that was awaiting
them there was no king to stand in their way now

  little use it was to give them any assurance of
safety these people had known terrible times most
of them even doubted that the fight was finally won
that the glacier was even now retreating its still
snowing is it not they would say and regard us with
the disdain with which one regards a prevaricator
even if the glacier has stopped due to your jetties
it stopped only in the tropics and on the shore-lands
here we are too far from the coast and too high up
in the air for warm sea currents to do us any good
and then too these winters are so long so very long
-and so very cold panama is too far a distance for
us half-starved as we are to travel over a world of ice
locked in by these few salvaged mountain peaks we
are to some extent safe even if we are hungry and we
do not care to risk the furies of the arctic gales on
the lower plain lands below if the heads of this new
the sixth glacier



government that you talk about really do want to help
us and are our friends then why do they not send
us food and fuel instead of armored sleds and soldiers
with guns isnt nature cruel enough with her ice
and storms

  however if you two are sincere and are really
speaking the truth then go home let them know how
we stand here and return with pardons and with food
well find some way out after that but no soldiers
for remember this and here a score of hard sunken
eyes gleamed upon the major weve got the girl she
is our hostage and the ransom is food

  a newcomer entered the group a cadaverous youth
hollow-eyed and prematurely aged in his hands he
carried some bits of broiled meat almost black from
too much open fire he handed it to me reluctantly
as if giving up part of himself

  for your trip he said theyll give you some
guns too dont be afraid to eat it buddy it aint
human flesh its coyotes paws kind o burned but
still bettern nothin at all an say hurry back with
some real grub will you

  well heres one at least that has a bit of faith in
us i told the silent major my judgment however
was short-lived for scarcely had we gone a hundred
steps when the thin youth shouted after us hey
you guys came his high pitched nasal tone and there
was not a little malice coupled with it better bring
the grub else well eat that girl the majors legs
became springs that instant lets hurry he said
and bring them something to eat the poor devils
are starving

  wc found our motor-sled almost intact where the
hungry igloo-dwellers had left it on the night of their
stealthy attack only the wooden parts of it were
gone for the nights were very cold here and fuel was
at a premium i started the motor and it purred
hopefully

  then followed a quarter hour or so of silence the
military man was drumming on the glass of the useless
and shaky door which rattled with each vibration of
the speeding sled once we passed a sample of heavily
fur-clad men on long and awkward snow-shoes with
rifles in their mittened hands they walked laboriously
as if the journey had been long and tedious and the
snow had been deep one had a dead fox slung over
his shoulder

  we were now entering a slope made hazardous to
such travel by a series of very sharp curves huge
pillars of ice jutting out of the snow made speed im-
possible i had just put all of my weight on the foot-
brake ntechanism which released a heavy spiked beam
into the soft snow under the running sled and at the
same instant stopped the huge propeller which pulled the
sled forward and had shouted to my companion to
take hold of the emergency brake lever at his side
when i felt the icy floor beneath us giving way at the
same time i was aware of a crash that sounded like a
million ice-picks at work at once down we slid on
the tumultuous crest of an avalanche men machine
ice snow rocks for about a quarter of a mile away
from the mountain-top home of the igloo-people that

loomed like an island out of the shining flat back of
the glacier a moment passed and we were pushing
our way fiercely and ponderously through a huge snow-
bank then everything came to a sudden standstill
we emerged scared shaken but uninjured the
wrecked auto-sled lay a mass of twisted iron of the
hill a long straight trail cut in the snow above us
showed the route we had come

  its all over now i guess i remarked as i con-
templated the hopeless wreck and it looks like snow
much snow the sky was like lead

  night will be upon us soon too thus from the
major

  oh well it always is--sooner or later

  its four now by my wrist-watch is there no way
out no way to fix er

  i shook my head slowly

  about how far are we from the nearest settlement
four hundred miles at a very conservative estimate
four hundred miles-gee we might try going
back why not 

  for answer i pointed to the almost perpendicular
wall above us

  uh oh yes guess we cant at that no chance
for climbing isnt there some way to repair the
machine though we have tools

  we have them scattered over about a quarter mile
of snow yes

  gosh but you seem to take it easy theres lives
depending on us man

  well what do you suggest

  uh cant fix er thats certain lets see

  he was gone for a few minutes and i could hear
him tinkering with the wreck

  no use he said upon returning fur and face
marked with black grease spots the motor fell out
i got the guns though we very likely will need them
huh-what was that

  sounded like wolves to me

  wolves

  yes  guess so wolves or coyotes better let
me have one of those rifles

a little while later we were inspecting the
wreckage together repair was absolutely beyond
possibility ill the rapid flight to the base of the hill
the entire fore part of the sled had broken loose and
was now buried in deep snow somewhere between the
base and the summit the top and one of the sides
were crushed in the radiator was gone as was the
battery one of the light aluminum-steel runners was
twisted into a spiral as if done by a cyclopean hand
and the light rapid-firer was torn from its tripod we
were lucky men to have escaped alive

  no its no use  absolutely no use i told the major
well have to stay until something turns up that
is unless you care to try four-hundred miles of snow
or this hill above us i dont know which would be
worse

  once more the series of long drawn-out howls arose
and pierced the air this time they seemed nearer
the wolves are calling to each other i said finger-


amazing stories

ing my rifle nervously they have sighted us keep
close to your gun cummins lets try to fix that
rapid-firer it may come in handy better have some
gasoline and matches near at hand the tanks in-
tact i hope have you ar flashlight 

  night came upon us suddenly and brought with it
the wind and snow it fell in streaks about as fast as
snow could fall it never fluttered it fell down in
chunks and small masses and covered everything in
a few seconds time with a blanket of smooth whiteness
at intervals of a few minutes the vandal beasts of
the ice-fields mad with appetite continued their weird
ominous calls

  it must have been somewhat past midnight before 
the wolf-pack howled itself into enough courage to
attack the grim gnawing pangs of hunger make
even the most cowardly brave the most discreet reck-
less the most lamb-like fierce the snowfall had
abated to some extent but the thick flakes were still
coining down and covering our wrecked sled amidst
the twisted tin and iron where we had taken refuge
from both beast and element we had decided upon
the plan of each taking four hour shifts on guard duty
while the other slept i was allowed the first shift 
at sleep huddled up among a pair of heavy blankets
which the people of the glacier had returned to us
and my own huge fur coat it seemed only a minute
after i had fallen asleep that the major awoke me
in the flare of the burning gasoline i could see that
his eyes were weary likejhose of a man who had only
nowr left behind him a long hard illness he pointed
to a couple of springfields near at hand

  they sound nearer every minute he let me know
in a low sepulchral tone once i was even able to
see the gleam of eyes a score of twinkling green pin-
points dark as all hell outside and im sleepy keep
pouring gas into that tin-plate or the fire will go out
and theyll attack no snows falling in i fixed our
roof and fearing that the weight would crush it in

i kept the snow brushed off its four oclock now and
not so very far away from dawn so lets hope for the
best theres some cigarettes on the seat next to you
better light up a fag is a good companion on a lonely
watch i can testify to that good night

  the night was cold and the wind blew hard and
wafted to my cars the long drawn-out eerie yelp of
the predatory beasts made mad by hungers unrelent-
ing lash i found the majors cigarettes and took his
advice then with nothing better to do i fingered
the magazine of one of the rifles and made the other
ready for combat at a moments notice the snow
kept falling steadily but as the wind came from an
opposite direction it did not bother me i was safe
behind the shelter of the wrecked auto-sled at times
however the strong blast from off the plains threatened
to push sled and all over on its side and i began to
have apprehensions for our little stronghold also
under the weight of the accumulated snow the weak
roof was beginning to give way protesting as it did
so with cracks and groans so with rifle in one hand
and flashlight in the other i crawled through the bat-
tered door of the sled and out into the wind and snow

i felt as the storm-struck mariner must feel when he
is aroused from his slumbers by the call of the mate
at midnight or when amidst the wild diapason of wave
wind and human throat he hears the most dreaded yeti
of those who dare the seven seas all hands on deck
to man the life-boats i lowered my head like an
angry bull as i bucked the gale-driven snowflakes in
the near distance the wolves howled and i could see
the reflection of my tiny gasoline fire in a hundred
green eyes i fired a wanton shot and for a few min-
utes there was a silence then i heard the majors
excited voice

  what is it bender ho bender where are you
his words ended in a scream and amid the crack of
his gun  could hear the scraping of paws and the
sounds of struggle within the sled i arrived as the
light went out a wolf yelped a cry of pain and major
cummins gun barked out again a stentorian stacatto
noise above the howls of the hungry pack a long
furry body fell heavily at my feet i turned my flash-
light on the major the man was a born soldier in
a moment i was at his side

  light the fire quick bender he snapped out in
a naturally commanding voice sharp and sudden my
god man what was your idea in leaving thats all
they were waiting for its a lucky thing for you that
you came back alive good shes lit keep er like
that our lives depend on that flare just now are
you sure that were safe on all four sides  better get
your light and see we cant take any risks you know
but i wish it was daylight here they come again
look at their eyes

  three score green spots flickering with evil intent
appeared suddenly in the dark about a hundred feet
or so from us the major had automatically taken
command for it was battle and war was his trade at
his advice i poured more gasoline into our make-
shift burner he fired three times in rapid succession
and a bowl of pain rang out in the night a series of
low hoarse growls contrasted grimly with it as the
unfortunate victim of the old soldiers aim was being
devoured by his famished fellow hunters

  weve got to go easy on our ammunition remarked
the major smiling and i began to like him a bit now
at his own game he was very different from the man
i knew

then for a long while it seemed a year the
howling continued it seemed to harmonize with
the voice of the wind at the price of two broken
pocket-knife blades and a cut thumb i managed to cut
some strips of tin folding these into a cup-like shape
we filled them with a gasoline of which the tank hap-
pily was still rather full thus we had in instant readi-
ness a dozen or more of very crude incendiary bombs
in case of a second attack the major had sallied forth
into the darkness and had brought back with him the
limp body of the second riddled beast which fell quite
close to the side it was an airedale dog gaunt shaggy
and fierce with a red hole behind his right ear

  wild dogs not wolves commented the major in
a more or less surprised tone once upon a time
the sixth glacier



mans best friend and companion now gone back to
the savage stage again just as these igloo-people have
gone back to the days of the caves it caused men to
become cannibals little wonder then that hunger should
drive a dog into a wild animal stage again

  yes i interjected its only a few thousand years
since this was their regular life lets throw him out
to the pack maybe itll ease their appetites a bit and
make them less eager for us

  it was at this moment that the first wild dog jumped
into the opened door and threw me bodily to the floor
of the sled i felt a cold snout at my throat and un-
loosening my glove got hold of a handful of coarse
fuzzy hair an icy paw clawed at my face and i
heard a rumbling growl only a few inches away in the
ebony of the darkness i kicked the beast loose after
an effort and then as i arose i heard the majors rifle
i picked up my own and fired twice at the open door-
way where a dark shadow appeared to merge into the
surrounding shadows i was rewarded by a yelp of
pain and then sharp teeth tore at my fur coat and i
fell again i beat at the head of my canine attacker
with the barrel of my rifle and then the heavy body of
my companion rolled on top of me panting fighting
silently someone was tearing viciously at my right
boot and with the other i placed a heavy kick on a
head and as the teeth gave way i heard a yelp of
pain somewhere during the turmoil i had picked up
a big wrench the sole survivor of a large set of tools
and with this i beat at the furry assailants on the
majors back a rifle is such an unweildy weapon when
the combat is hand to hand the major fired once
more emitted a horrible oath and then i heard the
pounding of huge fists on cracking ribs a moment
later i was on my feet

  in the flare of our small gasoline burner ghostly
in the whirling snow drift i saw an eager waiting
pack outside red tongues licking icy chops god help
us i thought if some of these hunger-maddened beasts
succeed in dragging us out from behind the compara-
tive safety of our little fort with that i lit one of
our improvised gasoline bombs and hurled it into the
midst of the yelping pack of dogs for a moment
they stood their ground nobly-only for a moment
four years of savage life had completely reverted them
into the primitive wolf-pack ages it made them fear
fire and the pack gave way as if struck by a thousand
furies the major was still struggling and once or
twice i heard him curse the next moment found me
at his side i kicked i struck i tore i fired my rifle
and hurled my grenades the gasoline burner suddenly
went out as a huge body fell against it a dog yelped
loudly in agony and jumped through the doorway and
disappeared into the night and the snow-drift his side
smouldering with the burning gasoline i heard the
stock of the majors springfield fall heavily upon some-
thing that cracked sharply beneath it once twice and
then three times and the next moment we were alone
again

  quick bender the major was speaking in an even
unperturbed tone light that gas again or theyll be
back upon us damn em for a thousand furies im

sore and bruised all over help me get er out of the
way

  he was badly bitten and his fur coat was in tatters
blood streamed from a gash in his right temple and
there was another in his right cheek i rubbed his
wounds with snow and bandaged them with a piece
torn off my once white undershirt

  the next ten minutes were silent i saw a maze
of sharply flickering green pin-points crawling slowly
upon us indeed these beasts who had been mans
born companions for more than fifty centuries and
had throughout those centuries learned not to fear his
fire and his noise were coming back again with grim
hunger a sure incentive foot by foot they came
slowly at first and then more boldly and in a minute
we were battling for life once more reaching for a
gasoline bomb i was dragged outside flat on my back
on the soft white snow newly fallen i had dropped
my rifle in the short melee but luckily still retained
my long-bladed pocket knife the best of weapons for
close fighting i felt the points of strong teeth sing
deep into my thighs and shoulders one big furry
fellow growled as he jerked madly at my coat-collar
one time i tore a hairy face loose from my neck and
received a severe gash on the back of my hand for my
trouble three times i felt my knife-blade stick deeply
into the soft flesh and i fought that much more ter-
ribly as i heard the accompanying yelps of pain a
dog tore at the heavily booted calf of my left leg and
with the other i struck out at him madly and swiftly
and arose automatically to my knees a big dog tore
loose my fur cap and his teeth grazed my scalp a
moment later i was aware of a warm trickle covering
my face at the same time my knife sank again and
the brutes body fell away from me then i was hurled
forward into the soft snow face first and crouched
together at the instant like a battling leopard who is
cornered by his foes i heard major cummins shouting
when i got to my feet again took two steps toward the
marooned sled tossing a dog bodily into the air and
away from me felt teeth sink painfully into the fleshy
part of my back once more i felt the warm ooze
of blood then i was tripped and rolled in the snow
again my head buzzing like a thousand bees the next
moment a huge and ponderous bulk sprawled over me
and i heard the majors reassuring voice soft as a
mothers yet firm as iron a blade in a velvet sheath
he fired once kicked a couple of canine enemies from
my limp form and then i became aware of huge arms
lifting me into the sally port and the safety of our
sled i heard the heavy slam of the door and the next
instant everything became dark the stygian ebony void
of all consciousness

ere drink this bender were the first words
i heard its molten snow and its as good
as water i melted it over the gasoline my god man
but you are torn up lucky for you that you were able
to make your way back to the sled as far as you did
for i certainly never would have been able to drag you
in if you were one foot farther away and that would
have meant the last of both of us i had to fight the


amazing stories

devil himself as it is those brutes were savagely hun-
gry there is not a solitary body left outside nothing
but a few bits of bones and hair and crimson snow

   i opened my eyes and it was daylight for a moment
i felt dizzy but after a drink from the majors prof-
fered cup full consciousness began to return i lay on
the furs swathed in crude bandages and red with my
own blood i looked at my companion the man to
whom i owed my life his mien was stern a military
mask his shirt and his o d breeches were in scarlet-
tinted rags his head was bandaged and across his left
cheek was a still fresh crimson-colored gash long and
deep showing only too well what those deadly fangs
could do i extended my hand and i said ill never
never forget this his answer was a smile

	i had two long scalp wounds and a number of slighter
ones my neck was batliy bruised and some skin was
torn from my throat and chest my left arm was
somewhat mangled by the sharp teeth of the canine
attackers and both of my legs and my back suffered
bites

  noon came and with it came fever i talked of
clara mournfully dolefully with ire i cursed the
major i shouted and i cried like a peevish child shrilly
and with force thrice so i learned later the soldiers
strong arms pushed me back upon my crude sick-bed
of blankets and furs once i tore my makeshift band-
ages from my wounds and ran semi-naked out into -
the snow the imps of delirium had me in their ter-
rible grip and it was only when complete exhaustion
had overtaken me and brought with it an icy sweat
that i became quiet cold snow-packs upon my fever-
flamed head relieved me a bit and i shut my eyes and
drowsed off into a restless sleep broken by bits of
bothersome dreams i saw the savage hunger-crazed
dogs again and i cried out to my companion to drive
them away they were big dogs giants and each of
them had the huge bewhiskered visage of the selfish
ex-king of the igloo clan on the hill-top above us
then came clara clad in furs and with a big rifle scat-
tered the dogs to the four quarters of heaven but
the major picked her up in his big arms and carried
her away leaving me behind to the mercies of the
mad canine foe i shouted curses after him as i
watched him go after that i awoke and asked for
water the major handed a tin to me and i drank
greedily for i was trying to quench a fire within me
tottering on the fever-ridden brink of that borderland
that lies between sleep and consciousness i shouted
to the major to keep off the dogs then once again

i opened my eyes everything seemed foggy and in
the mist stood clara the major tall and portly in his
tatters old stephen dunraven wrapped ill many furs
and two khaki-clad men one of them very tall and
thin the other short and stout as if from a distance
and through the dull roar of a pounding surf i could
hear words spoken involuntarily i shut my eyes
rubbed them and then opened them again clara tall
and junoesque in the olive-drab uniform of a red
cross ambulance driver was offering me a drink her
voice sounded pleasant and i accepted the drink a
white-clad nurse was fixing the bandages on my bead

with swift deft fingers that told of much experience
dunraven was in conversation with the short fat man
who was busy with my lacerated legs not bad is it
doctor  he was asking the stout disciple of esculapius
the tall man was standing very attentively near by
basin in hand i felt soft kindly fingers on my wounds
and i was indeed a happy man to know that this was
reality and not the mad hallucination of a fevered brain
succor had arrived at last

  an hour later i was prone upon a soft ambulance
cot speeding at a mad pace southward through the air
the bulky ex-magnate and man of science was sitting
by my side the medical man was near him while the
major stood at my head he was relating in a simple
way the story of the fight ungarnished statistical
later in the clay i learned that soon after my last de-
lirious attack had weakened me and i had fallen into
a moaning and a broken slumber the ever-vigilant
soldier army man that he was had espied far overhead
outlined like so many tiny black specks against the
leaden sky a score of northward bound airplanes tak-
ing them for the searching party as they actually turned
out to be he hit upon the happy idea of signaling them
with fire emptying the residue of the contents of the
unlucky sleds gasoline tank on some rocks from which
he had scraped the snow he lit this and now that the
snow fall had ceased it flared up and threw a huge
column of black smoke toward the heavens fifty
feet from it the major stood wildly waving his shredded
fur coat one of the pilots flying lower than the rest
and on the lookout for either roving bands of fur-clad
vandals hungry igloo-dwellers or wandering sur-
vivors of any of the numerous expeditions that had
failed to return had eyes sharp enough to be able to
discern the tiny figure and the huge ostrich feather
curl of smoke a mile beneath him he signalled his
companions and the rest is history

  it was in the emergency hospital at washingtonia
that the corpulent amateur of science congratulated me
bully-boy bender he said the major here says
that you fought like a wildcat lucky though that we
came in time

  major cummins however now that the dog war
was over fell from his natural element and became
plebian and awkward again with clara  his arm
unconscious of my very natural chagrin he stood at
the foot of my cot looming bulky beside his graceful
spouse and recalling to my mind scenes of twenty years
ago and schoolboy days when i had in one class with
me a big overgrown dull country boy five grades be-
hind his age

chapter ix

a retrospect

five swift years have already flown by since the
solar system became free of the nebulous frigid
ocean in space and since the last of the sixth gla-
cier receded beyond the arctic circle and left behind it
a barren land ten years since the first warning cry of
stephen dunraven which was echoed so suddenly by
the cries of terror from the northern lands to-day i
review in retrospect those terrible days when the polar
the sixth glacier



ice fields invaded the temperate zones safe in the little
red brick structure on the brink o the newer new york
bay the new home of the scientific news b i b
sad to say died about a month ago and now i am the
editor old stephen dunraven was in to see me yes-
terday he has grown fatter grayer grouchier
now however he is a happy man three whole pages
amply illustrated had i vouchsafed him for the story
of the days when the spiders ruled the roost the big
black cigar that he gave me was delicious even though
i had to be a very patient listener to an arachnidean
diatribe that took up the better part of an hour

  also  learned that the cordillerian ice sheet of
many years ago was nearly five hundred miles wide aud
extended as far as washington as it came swiftly
and steadily from the pole it drove this spider race
before its icy fury to seek newer homes in more south-
ern climes where the fifth glacier could never go then
from the region of the deewatin ice sheet which like
an immense finger of destruction reached down from
the hudson bay countries deep into the heart of the
kansan plains came another race of spider people
also fugitives from the boreal foe and they too set-
tled at the site of what today is the mecca of all scien-
tists there the two races of spiders found the savage
ape man our tree-climbing ancestor and made of him
their hauler of stones and builder of cities later came
wars as wars will ever come where two peoples dwell
close to one another and as the warring arachnideans
slaughtered each other the glacier coming from the
north turned the summers into winters and the temper-
ate winters into winters of arctic climes nature true
to its law of destruction of all that is unfit for the
place and time drove the weak spider race ruthlessly
into the sand-waste regions with her icy lash from the
northern pole then the ape man lived wildly amidst
the ruins of old-time grandeur for countless years in
a glory which he never could understand time slowly
buried them as it passed on beneath its waste of cen-
turies till only the moulded tablets remained intact to
tell of the history of these strange four-legged people
who lived loved fought wrought and died there and
then became one with the darkest oblivion fugitives
like us from the northern ice they who had raised
aloft a civilization and were contemporaries of the
dawn man the auroch and the giant-elk

  in sharp terse sentences such an antithesis to his
hollow voice the amateur scientist spoke to me and
every word of his speech sounded like a command
from a tomb

  what strange manners of earthly life he said
even now lie buried beneath the soil since the first
bit of animism crawled out of the bathybian ooze at
the birth of life who can say  we two-legged human-
kind are by  means the sole boasters of a rational
mind only the over-egoed fool dare say he is

  he left a while later a man who had lost everything
yet faltered not in that which he had chosen as a life
work a rebel forever at odds with the rest of the
conservative world one of the few of its dwellers who
help make progress possible by never crying surrender
and by never being satisfied-a skeptic of an old man

long ago disillusioned by life man and pleasures yet
after his visit somehow or other i could not help but
think that in reality there had been two stephen dun-
ravens one who had died during the sixth ice age
and the other who sphinx-like rose out of his shroud
a tender more contrite man born of the others ashes
though he still dared to doubt

the great gardener had weeded his earthly gar-
den only too well and left but one-third of its
former one and a half billion to refill and recruit the
world discontent and strife followed fast upon the
heels of the settlement of the reclaimed lands people
still insisted upon recalling old boundary lines and their
petty hatreds of the past men and women wanted
power more than they wanted homes newer nations
sprang up north east south and west over hill and
dale as soon as the ice had gone and the floods had
abated the first comers naturally enough settled
upon the choicest of lands and wars soon followed
then plague followed war as it often does sparing
neither young nor old aud the grim bony man with
the scythe easily settled the disputes that guns had
failed to do for ten years after the sixth glacier
had joined the hoary past the heterogeneous popula-
tion of europe and for thrice that long the more
heterogeneous populations of asia grappled with itself
while those who had deigned to linger behind in the
tropics fought the natives with equal fury

   on this side of the atlantic however things were
more quiet a stricken one-quarter of a once one-
hundred and twenty-five million came back in four
years to a land of many million barren acres towns
sprang up on prairies and on hills or in vales and cities
along rivers and bays farming commenced on the
day that the first settler from the south set a rock down
on the ground as a stake and said that these few sur-
rounding acres are to me and mine home as i write
today five years after the ice has left at least for
another thousand centuries the new united states of
america that extends from the rio grande and the
huge gulf to the icy top of the globe is starting all
over again just as it did once nearly five hundred
years ago cities are springing up over the glacier-
demolished terrain where other cities once hail been
on the water-girded site of new york city  the
broad lakefront where once chicago stood on san
francisco bay  denvers mile-high altitude los
angeles is rebuilding with a furore just as el paso
new orleans and galveston are doing the new homes
everywhere are mocking the beaten icy foe by now
peoplb only know from memory about the ravages of
the ice king from the poles

   the newcomers are still drifting in slowly every
day-weary heartsick men and women from the des-
erts of mexico or from the plain lands farther south
big ships which had happily survived the big ice walls
that for five years unmercifully swept the seven seas
are crossing the oceans back and forth laden heavily
with huge cargoes of food timber and humanity while
the nucleus of a future railroad system is even now
stretching its long fingers of steel into the heart of


amazing stories

mountain desert and plain gigantic cargo planes are
daily alighting to succor the inhabitants of locations
where neither track nor broad highway has penetrated
wise men whose eyes could pierce the futures dim
veil are planting tiny trees on the hillsides and lowlands
where only so short a number of years ago giant trees
had stood unbowed in the turmoil of reconstruction
the nightmare that was the sixth glacier is forgotten
and only mourned ones occasionally remind us of those
terrible days when the ice came down from the north
and we went wild yet we can almost forget them as
we gaze up out toward the broad horizon and begin
again

   todays morning paper was filled with the spirit of
reform europe the five thousand-year-old hot-bed of
war and international hatreds tired of arms and worn
by disease decided to bury the hatchet and start a new
world on a better social plan a protocol was sent out
to the rest of the earths nations thus the idealists
dream of a utopia may after all not be so far away
a catastrophe is sometimes the gift of the gods

   most of the huge jetties are still standing though
the heating machines have long ago been taken down
and put to other uses northern europe and the lower
and centra parts of our own atlantic coast are even
warmer today than they were during the pre-glacial
years the winters are shorter and less harsh and
the summers come early and linger long for the series
of small jetties that raise gray concrete backs out of
the blue sea are still at their duty along our coast push-
ing the warm equatorial waters of the gulf stream
toward our shores and i for one say let them stay

now allow me a bit of time for one more brief
birds-eye view of the world as it is today the
sixth glacier has become history already new york
city is made up of islands no more the sudden rush
of the ice fields and the consequent passage for almost
five years of a mile thickness of moving ice turned
both the harlem and the east rivers out of their true
beds and now only the bigger hudson flows into the
bay where a newer and greater statue of liberty greets
it day and night the once huge metropolis of tall sky-
scrapers and brobdingnagian bridges of avenues of
magnificent houses and of more than five million souls
is now the hearth and home of but a mere half-million
a long drawn-out city facing the open and almost
bayless sea here and there the faint trace of some
street may still show strange prank of the glacier and
every now and then one does come across some half-
buried scrap of steel or masonry which the morning
ire field had failed to carry away the subway alone is
the most intact and although caved-in at scores of
places and full of debris of all kinds it still is the new
york subway of ten years ago and new yorkers daily
look forward to the time when they shall be able to use
it again one mile of ice stood over it for four long
years but it had borne the burden nobly

   both japan and britain had been pushed out of their
sites by the glacier while little iceland had been torn
in halves and shot two hundred miles to the south
the isle of man is no more when the sixth glacier

retreated it was no longer there in the antarctic part
of the world the glacier had been more merciful prob-
ably because there was not so much to ruin the ghosts
of capetown kimberly melbourne and of sydney are
to-day looking down from some municipal paradise in
the skies upon the newer cities that have taken their
earthly places sahara is a sea one with the cerulean
mediterranean gobi is a lake

  our own southern states unfortunate victims of
crazed mobs from the north are once more breathing
normally and under the strain of the added millions
are living anew many of cubas newest population
have refused to return to the states they seem to
like that hot little island whose population to-day is
thirty million

  but from asia came uglier news the yellow men
from the north have decided to stay south of the
himalayas china consequently is barren and the
russ is pouring into its fertile southern parts japan
retrogressed in civilizations scale for almost a thou-
sand years a tiny island kingdom full of hills and
flowers that proved so terrible a death-trap to its fifty
millions now about one million little swarthy men
and women live quiet bucolic lives in a barren mountain
land that was once opulent with pretty outlandish
houses and blossoming cherry trees

  the alps in europe and the rockies and the sierra
nevadas here have caught in their grips and have re-
fused to let go here and there a piece of the glacier
as it went back now in many a crevice and gorge
flow slowly down to the plain below huge glaciers off-
spring of a huger one prodigals who would never re-
turn

yesterday was christmas day and the world
forgot and made merry in the new paris a
little unpaved city on the seine there was exhibited
a relic picked up near the morroccan city of fez by a
moorish donkey-driver a piece of the tall eifel tower
that had been carried across the wide mediterranean
by the moving ice a mute witness of the pomp and
glamour that once had been paris a week ago a
farmer in virginia unearthed the huge pyramid top-
piece of the washington monument one hundred
thousand years from now when the time will be ripe
for the seventh glacier and the northern world will
have to hurry south again maybe some future stephen
dunraven will pick up a piece of the brooklyn bridge
or the white house and warn a sleepy world of the
coming of the ice

  just one more little picture ere i close clara
plumper now and quite matronly and the major now
an army man no more come to sec me often they
too have settled in the new city of new york that
stands facing the sea her father still a bit grouchy
and full of gout is with them-the proud grandpa of
two long-legged boys-still the same old pessimist nev-
ertheless he talks spiders with me whenever we meet
sometimes perhaps glaciers but never has he yet men-
tioned the many lost millions or the miles of car lines

moscow nov -soviet scien-
tists through an amazing series of
laboratory experiments are pene-
trating many secrets at life and
death

in moscow the head of a dog has
bean resuscitated and kept alive on
a plate for three hours after the
body to which it once had been t-
urtird was dead and discarded

the detached head barked with
pain and with pleasure although no
wniudi resulted as the vocal cords
had been severed it cfened and
closed its eyes which were ar sen-
sitive to light and touch as a living
dogs

the bodjless head-even swallowed
food despite the fact there was no
stomach for it to go into

artificial heart

the experiment was accomplished
by the use of an artificial heart-
an intricate apparatus of steel and
itober-which pumped blood to the
evsi head

t this artificial circulation of blood
which opens new vistas to the sci-
entific world is one of the experi-
ments-by which biologists and phy-
sieiftn of the soviet union expect
to establish the possibility of resur-
recting dead organisms it was con-
ducted by drs   brukhanenko
and  i chechulin at the moscow
scientific chemical institute

after administering an anaesthetic
the dogs head was severed

responds to toncb

the artificial heart then was at-
tached to the ope wood vessels
i an biocd watsent coursing through

the head that seemed completely
dead immediately there were signs
of life full consciousness however
did not return until the effects of
the anesthetic wore off

thereafter the head responded fo
the slightest touch the reactionto
pain or annoyance was so strong iu
nearly to wrench the head from the
mechanism that was keeping it
alive at the same time the mouth
opened widely baring the teeth a
if the dog were snarling and howl-
ing no sound of course issued
the tear glands lf the eyes also
functioned

still able to taste

a piece of cotton dipped in quinine
quickly was expelled from the mouth
by the detached head a piece of
cheese however was swallowed in-
dicating the head was capable of
tasting

all these experiments dr bru-
khanenko said prove that the or-
gans of sight taste and so forth
are functioning-that is the nature
of the central nervous system of the
detached head has not changed
much in- conditions of artificial
blood circulation but the question
whether the head actually feels
cannot be answered so easily as
whether it reacts it reacts to light
but we cannot decide whether it
sees

a similar experiment was reported
in tashkent on a monkey which
had been dead several hours it
was resuscitated by the reinjection
of its own btood and still is alive
and apparently quiet normal
cording to the report

the above is an authentic photograph just received from russia
and shows drs s s brukhanenko and s l chechulin of the
moscow scientific chemical institute who have been able to keep
a dogs head alive for a long period after its decapitation

in the past amazing stories magazine has often been criticised
even by experts who have denounced some of the stories in the
magazine as wild and entirely impossible particularly the stories
which we printed recently entitled the head by joe kleier in the
august  issue and the living test tube by joe simmons
in the november  issue came in lor severe condemnation in
each of these stories the author depicted a human head as living after
it was severed from the body

  a number of doctors and surgeons were most vehement in their
denunciation of such impossible stories yet exactly the same
experiment has now been made at the moscow scientific chemical
institute by drs s s brukhanenko and s l chechulin these
famous experimenters used the head of a dog in their operations the
results of which may be said to have been quite successful from an
experimental standpoint

  while the thing is of course gruesome in the extreme one never
knows what far-reaching effect experiments of this kind may have
it may be quite possible in the future to resuscitate people who other-
wise would be declared dead by keeping them alive artificially until
surgery has repaired damages which may have been due to accidents
and disease

  before you rashly condemn such experimentation remember
that it may be the means of saving untold thousands of lives in the
future

is given in the february issue of science and invention

the tube

y name is henry james and i am a fanner
astronomer living in the south of new
hampshire this name may mean little
to some of you but it is well known among
the scientists of america since the finding
of the tube from memos it is due to my study of
astronomy that the tube was found and the contents
were given to the people of the earth for had i been
an ordinary farmer i would not probably have had
enough curiosity to dig it out of the earth where it
had fallen

  you ask where is memos memos is the missing
planet of the solar system of ours i say missing planet
for it is a well known fact that there is a regular order
in the way the planets lie from the sun except between
mars and jupiter there has lain a gap until the facts
about memos were published it had been the idea
of most astronomers that the asteroids were the frag-
ments of the missing planet which in some huge catas-
trophe had been blown to pieces but we now know
that the black planet of memos fills the gap and main-
tains the regular order of our solar system why it
has not been seen is another strange thing but all is
now explained

  it was a hot afternoon in august and i was seated
under a huge maple tree near my observatory trying
to get cooled off when there came a swishing sound
and a white hot missile
buried itself in the ground
not ten feet from where i
was seated

  a meteorite
claimed i must dig it up
if it hasnt gone into dust

  i procured a spade and
dug down and around the
celestial visitor which had
buried itself to a depth of
about  inches in the soft
soil i finally uncovered it
and it lay there shimmering
with the heat my first
glance at it showed that it
was somewhat different
from the ordinary meteor-
ite in that it was almost a perfect cylinder in shape
i could not make out anything much about it on account
of its red hot state it took almost half of a day for
the thing to cool so that i could pick it up still warm
from its bed in the earth and when i did so i saw to
my astonishment that it was a perfect cylinder and
instead of being constructed of the materials that ordi-
nary meteorites are composed of it was made of a

greenish metal near one end was a groove running
around it there was no doubt that the missile had been
fashioned by hands and that i held a message from
another world

   i took the tube into the observatory and putting it
in a vise applied a wrench to it-gently at first then
with increased pressure but it did not seem to move
i tried turning it the other way and after a few mo-
ments the cap moved easily it came off after it was
started and soon the cap lay in my hands with
trembling fingers i took the cylinder from the vise
and up-ended it a glass case fell out on the bench
but was it glass it seemed to be yet it gave like
rubber it was without a seam apparently it had
been formed around the contents which were closely
rolled sheets of paper covered with writing finally
i took a pair of scissors and slit the container the
manuscript fell out and eagerly i picked it up it
was in a strange language and i could not figure it out

  i had to tell someone of my great find and the
first person i thought of was professor margehtes my
next door neighbor he was a german scientist who
had been exiled from germany at the beginning of
the great war on account of his pacifist tendencies
coming to america he had purchased the farm next
to me we had many ideas in common and i saw a
great deal of him

   i got him on the telephone very quickly for he hao-
pened to be in his laboratory when i called

  hello came his voice

                            this is james profes-
                          sor

yes vatiss
something big i think
i just dug a meteorite out
of the yard and it has a
manuscript in it in a lan-
guage i dont understand
vat  say dat again
i repeated my informa-
tion to the professor

  gott i vill be right
ofer

  and he was

   vere iss it he asked

  i	pointed it out to him
                          and with shaking fingers he
                          picked it up

  gott in himmel he exclaimed it iss in german

  then someone in germany tried to communicate
with mars or some other planet and it fell back on the
earth i said in a disappointed tone

  dot vas it butvait vait it iss vrum anudder
blanet

  is it from another planet i asked in astonish-
ment how could they have the german language

 rt many it might seem that all of the planets in
 - existence have now been discovered nothing could be
 i ex- further from the truth astronomers discover new planets
 every year as a matter of fact seven new ones were dis-
 covered in october 

              it is true that these planets are mostly of the asteroid
            variety and their orbit lies between mars and jupiter and
            that these planets also designated by the name of plane-
            toids are usually quite small on the other hand astronomers
            now suspect that there is an extra neptunian planet far be-
            yond the orbit of neptune professor pickering has even
            gone so far as to describe the supposed planet giving its
            diameter its mass and its orbit but the planet has not yet
            been found in the telescope

              memos is a charming interplanetarian story that will de-
            light you it might be called an interplanetarian extrava-
            ganza


as it steadied itself in the air i gazed at it in some apprehension for i was unarmed but it showed no hostility whatever-
nothing but curiosity then suddenly the words were imprinted on my brain as clearly as if they had been spoken whence
came you    then i became aware of others and turned




amazing stories

on another planet professor or even know about it
i will not reproduce the professors broken english
but will merely give the conversation

  they dont said the professor this is from
professor von altenberg who is on memos

  and which planet is memos

  that i dont know yet it may be venus and it
may be mars but how did he ever get there  i knew
von altenberg he disappeared from the face of the
earth just before the big war started he said he had
some kind of a rocket which would take him to mars
i never believed it nor did anyone else and we
thought that the ridicule had driven him into retire-
ment in some foreign country but he has succeeded
he has succeeded

  read it i said

  i will read it and translate it and you put it down
it is a story that must be given to the world especially
to the scientists for i do not doubt that it is true
now get ready

  but where is memos  i demanded again

  we will come to that it must be a planet we know
nothing about or lie would have called it by its right
name memos i wonder

  i got out a bundle of paper and sharpened a few
lead pencils and we began the transcription of one of
the strangest stories ever told what made it more
strange was that it was true it took us all that after-
noon and four successive afternoons to get the whole
story down in the form in which it follows i am not
a writer so the reader will pardon any errors of gram-
mar or syntax that may creep in but i am endeavoring
to give it exactly as it was written by professor von
altenberg and translated by professor margehtes
there will be many doubters of this tale but we have
the cylinders of an unknown substance to substantiate
our story and there is the mysterious disappearance
of von altenberg to be accounted for now the astron-
omers are sweeping the sky nightly hoping for a
glimpse of the black planet which sweeps along in its
orbit filling the supposed empty gap in the order of
the solar system

  i will let the rest of the story be the tale of pro-
fessor von altenberg

ii

the rocket

this is the eighth message i am sending ten
of these messages to the earth in hopes that one
of them will be found they are all exactly the
same except that each one starts with its own serial
message number

  for reasons which will become obvious i will  never
return to the earth except in the astral i will know
if one of my communications is found and it will be
revealed later how i will know

  my disappearance from the earth if remarked at
that time has been forgotten by now time is dif-
erent here than  the earth and i find that it seems
to pass more quickly many things have transpired
cm the earth since i left among other things the hum-

bling of my fatherland ah you ask how can you know
that and be on another planet wait

  i am professor von altenberg once rated one of
the leading astronomers of germany i was a pro-
fessor at heidelberg university when i began to experi-
ment on devices to establish interplanetary communi-
cation i believed that a rocket could be constructed
that could be fired to mars this led to even deeper
thinking and the consideration of the return trip which
could not be accomplished if explosives were used
finally after several years of experimenting i solved
the problem or thought i had i then began the con-
struction of the car which was to take me to mars and
return i will describe it but not in detail as the space
i have to use in these cylinders is limited aluminum
was used for the outer and inner shells toughened by
a process known only to me which i will later give
to the world if communication can be established i
think it can between the two shells was a filling of
asbestos packed tight the cylinder was twenty feet
in length and seven feet across on the outside which
gave it an inner diameter of six feet but two feet
of this was taken up by compartments that lined the
inner wall so that there were only four feet of clear
space in the cylinder

  on each of four sides was a porthole of specially
constructed glass double tat so arranged that the
vision was not distorted in any way the-cap of the
rocket was of casehardened steel and filled with a
complicated mass of springs to break the fall when the
car should light space forbids me giving the intri-
cate designs of the springs that may come later
just at the junction of the cap and the cylinder were
four small propellers which i hoped to use to deflect
the course of the car if necessary i never tried these
out so can not say if they would be successful or not
beneath the cylinder were four legs about three feet
in length on which the car was to be poised ready for
its flight through space between these legs was the
propeller which was to give the car its start and carry
it through the earths atmosphere beyond that my
cap which was highly de-energized in the gravitational
sense would go for the body to which it was headed
pulling the cylinder behind it the construction of the
propeller which is one of the greatest strides in propul-
sion will also be given to the world later on

  about three inches from the base of the cylinder was
a ring of a specially constructed alloy which revolved
over a series of magnets and generated power faster
than it was used to whirl the propellers you may
doubt this but i have proved it to my own satisfaction
at least in the base of the cylinder were the dynamos
and other electric appliances for its propulsion this
left me a space in the car of four feet by eight plenty
of room for one person

  i am going to cease telling of the details of the car
because my space is limited as i said before these
messages are being sent on a mernosiau day which
is about every forty hours of earth time for it takei
memos forty hours to revolve on its axis twanty
hours of daylight and twenty hours of darkness all the
year around when the sun sets  memos there is
mernos



no twilight but a swift transition from daylight to
dark and vice versa the temperature varies but little
and is about like that of the earth when the days and
nights are equal

  the cylinder at last was finished and sat on its four
legs pointing to the sky i tried to get scientists inter-
ested enough in the venture to help me finance the
trip for the building of the cylinder had impoverished
me

   met nothing but ridicule and finally the university
took cognizance enough of my scheme to ask for my
resignation as they said i was too hairbrained to be
a professor at the greatest institution of learning in
the world my cylinder achieved fame as the vagary of
a crazy professor these blows hurt and i determined
that i would show these know-it-alls whether i was
crazy or not i sold all of my scientific paraphernalia
and used the money to stock the car

  i had no ties to bind me to the earth and i was an
outcast in my chosen profession so i determined to
strike out for somewhere caring little where i landed

  i had a months wait until mars was overhead that
was a miserable period for me for i was openly jeered
at and ridiculed even the children pointed me out
as the crazy professor

  finally the time came when the red planet was above

i made no confidant of anyone but secretly prepared
for the trip i had water in a specially constructed
tank that would last me for three months and enough
provisions for six months i was more sure of finding
water at my ultimate destination than food

  when everything was ready i myself began to doubt
the feasibility of the thing the jeers egged me on
to one of the strangest trips that man has ever taken

  i got in the car by one of the two doors with which
it was equipped and made them fast then i turned on
the oxygen restorer which was a wonderful contrivance
invented by dr von bethwig a glance around the
car showed me that everything was in readiness for
the great experiment even then i hesitated to turn
on the current that would send the car into space but
would it a haunting fear began to possess me that
the scoffers might be right after all

  finally i walked over to the switch and threw it
with a mental prayer that the cylinder would go a
vibration in the car told me that the propellers were
going and i waited for some motion to tell me that i
was on the way there was no motion the car was
a failure i walked over to the door and threw it
open to get out suicide loomed before my eyes then
i gasped with astonishment the car was in the air
and rising fast

ill

mars

i came near falling out of the car in my astonish-
ment but the air was getting very rare and i
made haste to shut the door it zvas a success
but was  headed in the right direction  that thought
sobered me up and t went to the periscopic tube that
ted to a mirror on the point of the cap yes i was

headed right mars was directly above me i went to
the portholes and watched the earth now a vast con-
cave as it slowly receded i went to the etherograph
a delicate instrument i had invented myself which
gave the speed through space and soon found that i
was traveling at the rate of about  miles an hour
but would the speed continue to increase as sooii as
i left the earths atmosphere that was the important
question

  i curled up in the car and slept for the first time in
two nights when i awoke it was pitch dark in the
car i went to the porthole and peered out i was
still going the earth was a huge black mass that cov-
ered the entire visible heavens slightly luminous at
the edges ahead the red planet still glowed but with
a splendor not seen from the earth everywhere was
the intense blackness of space broken by the brilliant
points that represented stars the outside tempera-
ture had fallen to s degrees below zero and it stayed
at practically this point all the time i was traversing
space

  i will not go into details about the trip suffice to
say that the car attained a speed of  miles an
hour before i started the propellers in reverse and the
speed began to decrease so well did i time it that on
the twenty-first day out i landed on the surface of
mars with hardly a jar the car fell over on its side
and i got ready to alight my atmospheric gauge told
me that the atmospheric pressure on mars was just
about half of what it was on the earth i couldnt
ascertain the temperature as the thermometer had not
yet settled after its prolonged run at the absolute zero

  one of the doors was uppermost and i dragged out
a short ladder that i had for the purpose and opened
it cautiously a rush of air from the car and then i
felt the air of mars warm as a summer day on the
earth another theory of the scientists gone i got
out and looked around and exulted in the fact that i
had shown all those to be wrong who had ridiculed me
i stood upon mars the first man from the earth
i started to dance and then i was startled instead of
hopping up about ten inches i went up into the air
a couple of feet the planet being almost half the
size of the earth the attraction of gravity was con-
sequently less i found that i could leap nearly six
feet straight up into the air but the exertion fairly
winded me on account of the thinner atmosphere

  all around me was a vast sandy plain stretching
away as far as the eye could see without a mountain
peak to break the monotony nothing but an enormous
gulch that lay on my left far into the distance as
wide as the grand canyon and as deep it stretched and
it came to me at once here was the solution of the
canals of mars the canals of mars were nothing but
huge cracks in the surface of the planet not hand-
made at all

  vegetation there was but it consisted as far as i
could discern of only one plant a short growth with
dark yellow leaves and purple veins only about four
inches tall it seemed to grow in bunches on the desert
mechanically i broke off a frond and a thick purple
sap exuded i tasted it then i tasted it again it


amazing stories

was delicious the thought that it might have been
poisonous never entered my mind and i ravenously
devoured the sap of the plant soon i felt that i had
eaten a square meal

  the soil of this desert was of decomposed granite
evidently the planet was so old that the mountains
had all been eroded into sand-at least as far as i
could see

  not a bird not an animal not the least trace of one
nor of human life all was desolation but what was
that  looked again just on the edge of the gulf
stood a ruined wall there was no mistaking it it
was the relic of an ancient wall built by hands at
one time there was life on this planet but how many
ages ago i walked over and exariiined it it was
built of a stone whose like i had never seen on the
earth of a coarse texture brown- and yellow-streaked
i picked up a small piece and gave an exclamation
it was heavier than iron which meant that it would
have been as heavy as lead on the earth the wall
was about three feet in height and formed a perfect
square what it had been built for i could not imagine
the walls had never been any higher for there were
onlv a few fragments lying around and they came off
from the top of the wall where ages had loosened the
cement that held them together it might have been
a hundred years old and it might have been thousands
aha i had it the walls were the tops of the walls
of a building and the shifting sands had covered them
so that the portion that i saw was all that remained
above thesurface

  obviously this was the solution of the situation

  i stood gazing upon the scenery the sun shone
as brightly as it did upon the earth notwithstanding
the fact that i was forty million miles further from
it now flat flat flat nothing to rest the eye in the
vast expanse of desert the gulch was only a few
hundred feet away and i walked over and looked into
it then drew back with a shudder it was fully four
thousand feet to the bottom and twenty miles across
how far it ran i did not know but the canals of mars
so called covered nearly the entire surface so the gulch
may have run from pole to pole for all i knew or
cared there were indications of water erosion in the
gulch plainly showing that at one time a mighty river
ran through it but where was the water now had
the drying up of the planet spelled doom to the inhabi-
tants or had they been carried off by sonfe terrible
cataclysm before the water supply had failed

  here i was one of gods creatures alone as i sup-
posed upon a tiny speck in the vast universe and forty
million miles from the planet where i belonged how
many more of the tiny specks carried their load of
humanity in the vast realms of space how many had
lived out their span as had this one how many were
just beginning to teem with human life i stood mus-
ing on the inscrutable ways of the great architect of
the universe forgetting my weird and strange sur-
roundings altogether

  suddenly i was recalled to things martian by a light
touch on the shoulder rapidly i turned around and
then t saw it

 iv

manos

suspended in the air about three feet off the
ground was a spherical body about a foot in
diameter without visible means of support the
thing remained there as steady as a rock surmount-
ing the spherical body were five tentacles each about
eighteen inches in length four of them had fingers
at the extremities while the fifth had an orifice

  the body was so nearly translucent that i could see
the blood pulsating through the veins underneath
was a rudder-like appendage that waved to and fro
like the fin of a fish there were also two of the ap-
pendages at the sides of the globe it had one eye set
in the middle of the globe and very much like the eye
of a human being except for the fact that it was pur-
ple in color with a red pupil the globe itself was
of a reddish yellow shade approaching orange

  as it steadied itself in the air i gazed at it in some
apprehension for i was unarmed but it showed 
hostility whatever-nothing but curiosity then sud-
denly the words were imprinted on my brain as clearly
as if they had been spoken

  whence came you

  i pointed to the sky and answered

  the earth

  where is the earth came the question

  no need of language here the thing could read
thoughts as readily as i could read a book and could
project its thoughts as well project them so well
that i could get them as plainly as if spoken

the bright red star you see at night i hazarded

  polus thought the thing

  then i became aware of others and turned at my
back were six more of the globes gazing at me with
undisguised curiosity

  what are you called  i asked aloud but the vocal
part was unnecessary

  manos came the thought

  and what do you call this planet 

  manova

  then the globes floated together and held a spirited
thought conversation some of which i was able to
get after they had conversed in this manner for
some ten minutes the one who had first spoken to me
or i should say thought to me telepathed to me as
i may term it

  come with us to the great samozar he would like
to see you

  readily i consented for i saw that there was nothing
but friendliness in their attitude and the guide started
ahead while the rest folldwed at my side they were
actually fishes of the air and the fins kept them going
in the direction that they wished i afterwards found
they were very light being but a little heavier than
the atmosphere

  we went over the sands of the desert for about a
mile and then we came to a vast circular hole in the
ground nearly a hundred feet across i looked down
and saw that it was about sixty feet to the bottom and
spiralling it was a ramp that lead to the bottom 
mernos



went down the ramp while the manos floated down the
center of the pit timing their motion so as to keep
abreast of me gently as a feather falls they wafted
themselves to the bottom of the pit

  at the bottom was an arched opening and wc went
through it into a brightly lighted passage way i have
never figured out the source of the light they had but
it must have been a kind of radium energy that would
last for ages the lights were in round globes sus-
pended by a thin wire from the ceiling and i could
see that there was no place for a current of electricity
to enter them at intervals were lights of blue green
and violet which gave a beautiful color effect in the
corridors

  the passageway must have been nearly six hundred
feet long and it opened into a circular room that had
about ten doors leading out of it my guide conducted
me to a doorway on one side and through it into an-
other passage that led for a hundred feet on a down-
ward slant into a small square room

  and here was the great samozar upon a cushioned
throne at one side of the room lay one of the globes
but almost a third bigger than any of those who had
accompanied me he was of the same shade as the
others however

  what is this came the thought

  he comes from the sky said my guide

  how did he come asked the samozar

i described the way i had come and the samozar
nodded in understanding at least he thought he un-
derstood since i have learned more about the mental
processes of a mano however i doubt whether he did
what are you called

  a man i said

  how odd you a man and l a mano perhaps
that is where the former people of this world went to
then there were people like me on this planet once 
so it is handed down but so many countless ages
back that we dare not think about it once the outside
of this world was covered with huge cities of stone
they are naught but ruins now who lived in them
or where they went we do not know

  how long ago did you build this cavern i asked
we did not build it was the reply it was here
before any mano can remember

  i found that the manos did not have any traditions
of what must have been their great past when the
brain of the mano dominated the sphere all they
seemed to know was that they lived truly a decadent
brain they knew that there were three tribes of the
manos still living on the planet in different caverns
but the race was fast dying out through diseases that
they were too indolent to combat and didnt know
how to if they wanted to altogether about five thou-
sand of the manos survived on the planet they
were of a composite sex and the young manos which
were few nowadays came from eggs the average
life of a healthy mano was about iso years dfeath
came suddenly for there was nothing but the brain
to die and lingering sickness was practically unknown

  their burial custom was simple in the extreme
when a mano died his corpse was carried to the edge

of the great gulch and thrown over there were no
other forms of life on the planet except in the small
seas that still existed at the poles there a few fishes
survived the lupos the sap of which i had eaten
was the only vegetation on the planet and it was every-
where it was watered by the numerous fogs that
swept down from the poles

  i spent a week on mars and found that there was
very little to learn the manos knew next to nothing
and the only relic of their past greatness was the ability
to transfer their thoughts i visited the ruins of one
of the cities that was near the cavern and found that
it was indeed the relic of a lost race what were once
magnificent buildings stood in ruined grandeur over
a few of the doorways that had not fallen were in-
scribed strange characters i jotted down several of
these which resembled english characters greatly

  no traces of pottery or other articles could be found
though i hunted very sedulously through the ruins all
but the shattered walls were gone then i made ready
to return to the earth with my information-informa-
tion that would astonish the world if the world would
believe it

v

lost

how was i to get the cylinder in an upright
position  that question troubled me i studied
it from every angle i put it up to the manos
but they could give me no aid had a thousand of
them been able to get around the car they might have
raised it as it was they were useless to me aha
i had it the solution was plain providing the sandy
soil was deep enough

  i would dig down at the base of the cylinder and
work the sand out from under it then the cylinder
would slide into the hole and i could tilt it the rest
of the way it seemed easy but i worked for a week
before i got the rocket in a nearly perpendicular posi-
tion finally to my intense gratification it was accom-
plished i had it pointed directly at the earth the
manos stood around in curious groups as i toiled at
my task and if they could have cheered they would
have done so when the cylinder slid down into the pit
i had dug at its base

  i was all ready to start and i climbed into the car
that night as the earth drew near to the spot that i
wanted it in when by the periscope i saw the cylin-
der pointed directly at it i threw in the power and
again came the vibration this time i did not open
the door i looked through the porthole and saw the
surface of the red planet slowly recede which it did
more slowly than had the earth on account of the
thinness of the atmosphere which more than counter-
acted the lesser gravity i was homeward bound after
one of the strangest trips if not tlic strangest trip
that mortal man had ever attempted

  on the sixth day i had attained a speed of 
miles an hour and was congratulating myself that in
two weeks i would be home again to give the scoffers
a taste of their own medicine when there came a


amazing stories

violent jar and for a moment the car spun like a top
i was thrown here and there and received a number of
painful bruises before the car straightened again
hastily i rushed to the portholes and there skimming
away was a gigantic black mass i had just escaped
being smashed by a giant meteorite had it been a
few inches closer my career would have ended then
and there for the flying body would have burned the
car to a molten mass by the sheer impact as it was
it just grazed one of the legs i afterwards found and
tore it loose

  but where was i headed for now and what would
be my fate i was practically lost in the boundless
realms of space for the earth was no longer dead ahead
it was almost in my rear and i was going back in the
general direction of mars but i saw that i would
miss that planet by a long ways my only hope was
to land on one of the asteroids and from it head my
cylinder again towards the earth so that i could get
to my ultimate destination forty million miles to
go before i got into the orbit of the asteroids at least
and then no surety that i would hit one of them the
only thing i could do was to go at top speed until i was
within several million miles of the orbit of those bodies
and then slacken the speed and trust to god but
somehow or other i was not downcast at my ill fortune
for i seemed to have a feeling that all would come
out right should i miss any of the asteroids i would
most likely be condemned to rove the areas of space
until i died of starvation and then the shell would
finally be cast  some far-off planet to cause wonder
to the inhabitants thereof but this did not seem to
worry me for some reason or other i would come
through

  for eight days i traveled at the rate of 
miles an hour and then i reversed the propeller and
began to slacken there seemed to be some body pull-
ing me along but a close scrutiny of the ether ahead
showed nothing in sight slower and slower grew
the speed of the car and then looking out of the peri-
scope i saw a black body ahead and approaching fast
i was going to make a landing i wondered how hard
i would hit i could not slacken the speed any more
what was the body ahead a dead world it must
be for it did not shine with any refracted light which
denotes an atmosphere would it be possible for me
to leave the car to re-set it or would the temperature
be that of infinite space and too cold for me to survive

  that was something that could only be known after
i had landed nearer and nearer drew the huge black
sphere in the orbit of the asteroids where no such
body should exist its deadness had prevented it from
being seen from the earth and yet that was a strange
thing for the body should show some glow when the
suns rays felt on it i could figure out that it was a
trifle larger than the earth ah this was the missing
planet of the solar system but it was dead dead
and i would be too ere i could get away from it well
if it was the end i would meet it like a man

  suddenly like coming from darkness into light the
planet took on a luminosity and i was in an atmo-
sphere but i was traveling at the rate of  miles

an hour the periscope was useless it was covered
with vapor caused by the warmer air of the planet
striking the glass of the periscope and the lenses thus
clouding them up i was going to hit and hit lifcrd
it was the end i sat down on the floor of the car
and mechanically put my arms over my head why
i dont know as the shock would be so violent that i
had every chance of being dashed into a pulp at the
opposite end of the car

  then came the shock but it was not the shock that
i was expecting for the cylinder shot into the waters of
a sea down down went the cylinder until i began to
think that the dense pressure of the water would crack
the seams or collapse the cylinder as i was about
to give up hope in the creaking car it stopped its
downward flight and began to rise to the surface but
the damage was done in one end of the car a thin
trickle of water showed where the seams had been
sprung ever so little but enough to finally fill the car
with water and drown me i could not swim a stroke
mechanically i shut off the reversed propellers then
daylight flooded the cylinder and i was floating on
the surface

  the doorway was right on the top fortunately and
the car rolled but little i got out my ladder and climb-
ing up opened the door and peered about i was in a
great ocean but all was quiet and peaceful

vi

ashore

as i said i was in a mighty ocean apparently but
dead ahead and a mile distant was a shoreline
- and a sandy beach back from the beach was
a great forest the water was rising in the cylinder
and my only hope was to get it ashore or nearly so
i started the propeller and the cylinder moved ahead
through the water nearer and nearer drew the shore
and when we were about a quarter of a mile away there
came a shock and the cylinder was aground but how
to get to shore was the next problem the cylinder
had settled in the water until it was a scant eight inches
between the surface and the door and the vagrant
waves were breaking in it every once in a while had
the waves been anything like the waves of one of our
earthly oceans i would have been sunk long before i
had gotten this close to shore

  if i had been able to swim i could have made it
easily but i couldnt swim and drowning stared me
in the face after breasting the terrors of interplanetary
space but the tide was there a tide at low tide
i could probably wade ashore

  i made a mark on the side of the cylinder and
anxiously began to watch it fraction by fraction the
water rose the tide was coming in there was a
little hope however in the fact that it was rising so
slowly for that indicated it had nearly reached its
height the water was even with the door of the car
ere it began to go down again and i was drenched to
my shoulders besides a light wind was coming up
and the waves were getting a little higher then the
water began to recede-very slowly it is true but every
mernos



slight recession helped i began to take on new hope

  the sun which was a red globe in the east was
slowly sinking behind the forest it would be dark ere
i could get ashore but i was resolved to do so before
the tide rose again regardless of what unknown ter-
rors might lie in wait for me in those woods

	i shouted several times but no answering hail came
from the woody shore apparently i was on an un-
inhabited planet or at least in the uninhabited part of
one anxiously i watched the water line in the twi-
light of the strange planet not a sound of bird or
beast came from the woods- the breaking of the surf
upon the sandy beach was the only sound that assailed
my ears down down went the water line ever going
faster and faster and my hopes rose correspondingly
it would be but a short while until i could venture forth
but the darkness fell and the stars came out shining
with a sort of dim luminosity that was almost uncanny
not the twinkle that they displayed on old mother
earth but a steady glow far off to the west hung
two red planets or stars almost in a straight line and
i had no doubt that they were the earth and mars
forty and eighty million miles away they appeared the
same size because of the fact that the earth was twice
as large as the red planet

  at last i judged i could wade ashore and i slipped
off the top of the car into the warm water of the un-
known sea the water came to my chin and i cau-
tiously advanced a step or two it got no deeper nor
did it seem to get any shallower a few more steps
and i slipped down over my head frantically i ran
ahead through the water holding my breath and then
my head emerged again and i was in shallower water
i had stepped into a hole in the ocean bed shallower
and shallower got the water and soon i was only waist
deep then i fairly shouted with joy as i ran the
balance of the way

  saved saved

  but was i what unknown terrors might lurk in
those forests little did i care i was ashore and
that was enough tired and hungry i lay down under
a tree and quickly was fast asleep

  i awoke with a start it was daylight and the sun
was about an hour high i had the feeling that there
was a presence near me but a close scrutiny of my
surroundings failed to disclose anything though the
feeling that i was being watched kept its hold upon
me i shook off the feeling partly and began to think
of something to eat for i was hungry as well as wet
near me was a tall bush with a bright red fruit upon
it which looked good to the eye i reached up to pick
one and as clearly as if they had been spoken the words
were impressed upon my brain

  dont touch it

  i jumped and looked around there was not any-
thing or anybody in sight yet the warning had been
very plain i started to reach again and then desisted
over a little farther was a short bush with yellow
globes of fruit upon it i walked over to it and reached
for one expecting to get the warning message again
but i was hungry and determined to eat one anyway
warning or no warning but the warning did not

come so  took a bite of the fruit and ate it rapidly
it was delicious having somewhat the taste of a
banana with a pineapple flavor six of the fruits ap-
peased my hunger then i began to take stock of
my surroundings the trees and bushes were very like
their kindred on old mother earth the ground was cov-
ered with a short grass of a deep green color and there
were some flowers one in particular i noticed it
was fully ten inches across of a deep purple with red
edges and a brilliant scarlet center

  then i saw the first life of the strange planet out
of the woods came a great bird almost as tall as i was
and brilliantly marked the body was scarlet with
white spots the tail shaped like that of a peacock
was many hued it had a short blue neck surmounted
by a very large head which was shaped like the head
of an earth bird it was wingless and soundless as i
quickly learned upon the head was a tuft of purple
feathers

  calmly and in a dignified manner the bird approached
me showing not the least trace of fear it was either
used to human beings or else it had never seen one
before anyway i knew that it had nothing to fear
in the forest which was encouragement for me too
it walked around me in a circle with its head cocked
on one side and as i held my hand out it pecked at it
gingerly with its long bill then it turned and quietly
and dignifiedly walked back into the forest

  i scanned the woods carefully but could see no fur-
ther trace of life then i turned towards the sea far
off in the west a speck was growing larger in the sky
was it a gigantic bird or an airplane or airship i
was not destined to know for a twig cracked behind
me and rapidly turning i had my first glimpse of a
mernosian

vii

lorenda

calmly and unafraid he advanced toward me
and i will take this opportunity of describing
him for he was a representative type of the
mernosians he was clad in shimmery green tights
with a doublet of yellow and with blue shoes that re-
sembled leather though i have since learned that they
were made of the fibers of the bolu tree upon his head
was a conical cap of a greenish metal like the metal
that this cylinder containing the message i am sending
to the earth was made of upon his shoulders was
strapped a tube of the same material as the cap about
ten inches long and about two inches in diameter from
which two wires led to a medal or small plate depending
from his neck and which contained two push-buttons
rising from the cap were two small antennae which
trembled in the light wind that was now blowing

  as to his personal appearance he was exactly like
an earth man except for the fact that bis features were
delicate more spiritual and his complexion rather pale

  when he had advanced to within a few feet of me
he fixed his eyes upon me and as plainly as if he had
spoken came the impression on my wondering brain

  are you from the earth or from norros


amazing stories

   was astounded here  was on a strange planet
and the inhabitant of that planet surmised that i had
come from the earth i couldnt understand it my
mental faculties were in a daze and i could not even
think an answer

  you are from the earth he thought positively i
say he thought for he did not speak

  how did you know it  i asked aloud he cringed
a little as i spoke and i saw that he was unused to
sounds so i tried to remember to think my questions
and answers thereafter

  because only norros and your earth-in this solar
system-have the same kind of people as we you must
have come from one of the two because the people of
the planets of other solar systems are too far away to
reach us

  how do you know we call it the earth

  because i have been there often

  i gasped in astonishment this was beyond me
here upon a hitherto unknown planet i was meeting
a man who had visited the earth how had he made
the trip  these people must be far in advance of the
people of the earth to be able to travel thus

  what do you call this planet i asked

  memos was the reply

  how is it that it has never been discovered by the
astronomers of the earth i asked in wonderment

  because memos is surrounded by a belt of unknown
vapor that does not reflect back the rays of rhdor or
the sun as you call it all of the rays are absorbed by
this vapor and retained and transmitted to our sphere
this renders memos invisible to the puny instruments
of the earth

  in what kind of a car did you make your trips to
the earth how is it that no one has known of your
visit there

  answering your first question we traveled in no
car the mind alone has made the trips for know you
man of the earth we mernosians can detach the mind
from the body and travel at will among the far-off
stars

  himmel i exclaimed and that was all

  he smiled and waited for my next question as soon
as i could get my breath i asked it

  how much ahead of us are you in progress 
  thousands of years

  thousands of years 

  aye about four thousand years roughly speaking
starting from the time when conditions were the same
here as they now are on your earth but you are mak-
ing rapid strides in the right direction though there is
a terrible new conflict raging on your planet this
new conflict may complicate matters considerably
between whom

  austria and germany on one side and the allied
powers of france england and russia on the other
there was uneasiness when i left but no rumors of
war truly it amazes me to know that you know what
is transpiring on the earth perhaps you can foretell
also who will win the conflict

  it is not in the mind to foretell no one can say
the central powers may win then again they may not

   i am a german i said a little proudly

  then your sympathy will be with germany how-
ever you will get over that for i believe you will re-
main here the rest of your life

   i dont think it i know it unless you can get my
cylinder out of the ocean and repair it

   it can be done he said seriously but i think you
will elect to stay here when you know more about our
life

  what is your name for the earth

we call your planet julio you call narro saturn
but come he continued let us go before the coun-
cil of nine they will be anxious to see you and hear
your tale you are the first inhabitant from another
planet that has set his foot on memos

   in that way i am ahead of you even am i not 
oh no long ere your pyramids were built long
ere the sinking of your lost atlantis one horro milla
made a car such as yours and flew to mars and back
at one time interplanetary traffic was talked of but it
was abandoned because one sirro polu discovered the
ways to transport the mind through space why take
a month or more to go to one of the closest planets
when the mind can be transported in an instant to the
farthest limits of the universe

   no need at all i agreed will i be able to learn
to transfer my mind to other planets

   that rests with you alone you will probably stay
with us as long as you live though we will give you
every assistance if you desire to go back to julio the
secret of mind transmission may come to you also if
you have a receptive mind and you may visit your earth
in the astral and roam through boundless space at will
but you will have to study and concentrate there
will be no necessity to build ships and devices for safer
guarding the physical body from the various interstellar
dangers and inconveniences the astral body needs no
such form of protection

  we had been walking through the forest as we
talked and we now came out on a beautiful green
meadow with two low hills ahead of us separated by a
road

   beyond those hills lies lorenda said the merno-
sian

   what is the average length of life here i asked
   three hundred years came the amazing response
   and how long is your year

  just two of yours but when i said our life span
was three hundred years i meant three hundred of your
years

  what is your religion or are you too far ad-
vanced to have any

   that is a foolish thought you can not be too far
advanced to have religion we worship zerno the
same as your god the creator of the universe but
we do not see him as a personal being sitting on a
bank of clouds or on a golden throne god is all good
we have no conception of hell as many teach it on
your earth for there is no hell in our minds hell is
of your own making

  by now we were cresting the hills and as we came
to the summit i gasped in astonishment

government

lorenda the beautiful spread before me and
apparently covering a space of ten miles each
way lay a marvelously beautiful city skyscrapers were
there but they were more beautiful than any i had
ever seen upon the earth the skyline was not irregu-
lar but symmetrical here and there a dome or a
minaret pushed its head into the pale blue of the merno-
sian sky at the four corners of the city were four
spidery towers of steel or of a metal like steel with a
broad platform on the top and from one of which a
long cylindrical airship was rising straight into the air

but what amazed memore than anything else was
the fact that the air was literally filled with small fig-
ures that appeared to be mernosians

 what are those figures in the air  i asked

they are mernosians was the startling reply

 but how do they stay in the air i asked

 by virtue of this little tube you have noticed on my
 shoulders and wondered what it was for it is done
 by radium and radioactivity you will find out more
 about it later

 hinimel was my outspoken exclamation

 we seemed to be the only ones walking and i men-
 tioned it to my guide

 i walk because of you he replied were i alone
 i would transport myself by the tube no one thinks of
 doing much walking here the transportation by the
 tube is easier and quicker you will be doing it too
 fcefore long

 i would be afraid of falling

 there is no danger should the power fail in one
 station the next one is close enough to prevent you from
 falling

 suppose something happened to the tube

 the tubes are perfect not one has failed in the
 last four hundred years

 how big is this city

 lorenda is ten of your miles each way and con-
 tains a million and a half people

 how old is it

 five thousand of your years it was first built by
 mordos n the last king of memos

 then they are all republics here as i would naturally
 conclude since you have progressed so far

 one republic

 you mean the whole planet is under one govern-
 ment 

 precisely

 has the ruler much power 

 there is not one ruler the government is vested
 in the council of thirteen one from each political di-
 vision these political divisions were once the ancient
 kingdoms of memos the principal ones at least each
 one of these divisions is ruled by a council of nine
 who attend to local matters we are now going before
 the council of nine of lorenda

 i was too much lost in the wonders of the city to ask
 any more questions for a time magnificent it was
 beyond anything i have ever seen with no harshness

of architecture anywhere here and there a large
motor car went noiselessly by one loaded one empty
but not a pleasure machine did i see i was going to
ask the reason for this and then it came to me that
with the tubes vehicles were obsolete except for freight
hauling

  the streets were paved with a substance that re-
sembled asphalt except that it was of a dark green
color the sidewalks were wide and of a bluish green
stone which was very restful to the eye i remarked
this to the mernosian and he said that experiment ages
before had proven that this color was the easiest for
the eye the streets were uniform in width and fully
eighty feet there were no narrow streets or alleys
and the city was laid out in an absolute checkerboard
form there were no small residences all were tall
buildings the lower floors were given over to what
i supposed were shops

  here is the building of the council of nine said
my guide and we went into the magnificent building
over the door of which was an inscription which means
let the just govern the just

  once inside the great doorway we stood in a beau-
tiful hall of reddish marble paved with a beautiful
mosaic of flowers

  a red clad mernosian approached us

  a visitor from another planet he thought evinc-
ing not the least surprise

  yes thought my guide i am bringing him before
the council of nine

  it is fortunate that they are in session now i will
advise them of your arrival he left the hall and
went into a side room from which he returned very
shortly

  the council awaits you he said and then ushered
us through the doorway into the room of the council

i	expected to see a group of long-bearded men sitting
around a table and in this i was disappointed for they
were all young-looking men and were lounging in rock-
ing chairs which had a sort of desk fastened to one
arm one was clad in black the other were dressed in
yellow later i learned the significance of colored
clothes on memos the highest person in a torman
or political division wore a suit of black the council
wore yellow state officers of a lesser nature and over-
seers wore green as did my guide ordinary persons
were allowed to wear any color they wanted except
those noted the one in black directed his thoughts at
me

  i see that you expected to find us with hair on our
faces is it not so there has been no hair on the
tropic earth then again back to normal and later to
two exceptions where there was a throw-back to an-
cient times hair was unnecessary so it disappeared

  i	had gotten past being amazed at the ready reading
of thoughts possessed by this great race i can only
wonder now when the people of the earth will advance
to a similar state and do away with all deceit envy and
crime

  there may be things about us that are strange to
you continued the black-clad one but your people are
familiar to us we have visited your planet more


amazing stories

times than we can recall we have endeavored to get
into communication with some one of the earth thus
far no one has gotten far enough advanced to com-
municate with us however it may be that through you
a message will finally reach the earth

  then there is nothing i can tell you about the
earth

  nothing but we can tell you a great deal about
your earth that you do not know for instance do you
know hat a tropic era is approaching your earth an
era in which the ice caps will be melted from the poles
and there will be no cold spots 

  i do know that the temperature is said to be gradu-
ally rising i replied

  it is true and it is no idle prophecy many thou-
sands of years ago was a glacial period on your earth
and before that the carboniferous age when all was
warmth and tropical growth was ill profusion before
that was another glacial period and before that an-
other warm time and so  back to the time when the
earth was evolved from a nucleus you no doubt know
that our solar system trarerses a regular orbit but you
do not know that it completes a circle of that orbit in a
million years at one end of the orbit there is a belt
of warmth and at the other the intense cold of abso-
lute zero the earth and the solar system are now 
the edge of the warm belt which explains the rising
temperature of the earth already noticeable enough to
cause discussion among your scientists for ages the
earth will swing through the warm belt and become a
tropic earth then again back to normal and later to
another glacial period and so on

  how do you know all this

  we of memos know the uttermost secrets of the
universe we traverse the boundless realms of space
at will and naught is hidden from our prying minds
tell me are the other planets inhabited
mercury is inhabited by reptiles venus by intelli-
gent beings who have developed through the birds and
are consequently gigantic birds possessing an intelli-
gence on a par with the inhabitants of your planet
mars by globes-

  i was  mars before i came here i interrupted
then you know of the manos saturns moons are
inhabited by a race like you but in development date
back to the time of your julius caesar both saturn
and jupiter are in a gaseous condition so there is no
life there neptune is inhabited only by insects of
gigantic size of which the spider as you know it is
the dominating intelligence

  then neptune is the last of the planets of this solar
system

  yes there are none beyond it

  how long does it take this planet to revolve on its
axis 

  our days are just forty of your hours long and
our hour or lumo is practically the same as yours
from season to season we have twenty hours of day-
light and twenty hours of darkness our twilight is
short as you have undoubtedly noticed we have an
equal temperature the year around and the temperature
is the same from pole to pole that is occasioned by

 that ring of unknown vapor that surrounds us and
 wards off the absolute cold of outer space or rather
 keeps the suns rays on our planet after they have pene-
 trated it

row continued the leader or patrot as he
was called you will be afforded every cour-
tesy while here and your staying will not be
compulsory if you feel that you want to go back to the
earth we will assist you in every way we can dupli-
cate your machine for you and even improve it the
case will be made of arror which is the green metal
which when alloyed with certain other metals will de-
stroy the power of gravitation but we would like you
to stay with us a month or so before you decide what
you will do have you any near and dear relatives on
the earth

  not one i replied

  in a way that is fortunate said the patrot
while you are here you shall be clad as a mernosian
and shall have a mernosian name your name as long
as you are with us shall be guros julio guros means
visitor and julio is our name for your earth i have
no doubt that you will prefer our advanced civilization
to that of your earth and will become a permanent citi-
zen filos i leave guros julio iti your care the
council is adjourned

  i left the council chamber with filos who was no
other than the mernosian who had discovered me on
the sea shore and he conducted me down the street to
a tall building constructed of blue stone and very beau-
tifully carved we entered through the spacious open-
ing and went over to an automatic elevator alongside
the elevator was a shaft that ran clear through to the
roof and opened there on the blue sky or rather gray
sky of memos filos pointed out the shaft

  we always use that he said the elevator is for
freight purposes only but as you are not yet equipped
with a tube we will ascend by it

  noiselessly the elevator took us to our floor and then
filos conducted me down the hall and ushered me into
a beautiful suite of rooms

  this suite is next to mine and is yours as long as
you live on memos he said

  but how about the rent  i asked

  rent rent oh i understand there is no rent
  who pays for it i asked

  no one

  but i vyill have to find employment to pay for my
living

  he laughed joyously

  i forgot you came from the earth where money is
a necessity here you do not need money

  do not need money

  no whatever you want or need is furnished you
by the government no one abuses the power how-
ever for every mind is an open book

  how is it paid for and what supports the govern-
ment 
mernos



  everyone has his allotted task there is very little
arduous labor as radio energy takes the place of elec-
tricity and with it power is conveyed to machines that
do marvelous things about the hardest job is to watch
the machinery and see that it is oiled every so often
of course in the machine shops there are tasks that
require hard work but they are filled by volunteers
who are relieved by others at frequent intervals those
who do the hard work are rewarded by a term on the
council of nine which is the highest honor that can
be conferred by a state except the election to the coun-
cil of thirteen the member to the council of thir-
teen is picked from the council of nine and is gen-
erally one who has done some special work

  then things are different than on the earth where
the hardest workers get the smallest pay

  the time will come though it is still in the distant
future when the earth will attain the point we have
reached it is bound to come with education comes
higher thinking and higher thinking brings more scien-
tific deductions but come you are hungry

  i had to confess that i was

  come over here then he said hold your mouth
up close to this horn and press the fourth button on
that board

  i did so and immediately tny nostrils were assailed
by a most delicious odor

  inhale it said filos i did so and gradually the
hunger was appeased

  that is our method of feeding ages ago we did
away with the mastication of food now as you per-
ceive it is all taken into the system by inhalation it
took centuries of experiment to attain this perfection
but of course that does not mean we do not eat at
times for instance there are fruits in the forests that
we eat though some of them are poisonous-

  then it was you who warned me in the forest when
i reached for that red fruit

  yes one taste of that fruit and you would have
suffered agonies for an hour that was the fruit of
the jomo one of the two poisonous fruits on this planet
now if you will cotne here you will get your first les-
son on this board this first button is for music
the second button is for drama on that screen over
there the third is for the news of the day the fourth
you have already used now that you are familiar
with your apartment we will go to the tuberer and the
clothier and get you a tube and clothes then you will
look like a mernosian except for your beard there is
no law against wearing a beard here so if you want to
retain it as a distinguishing mark you are free to do
so but if you want to have it permanently removed
however it can be done in an absolutely painless
manner

  we descended by the freight elevator which i can
not remember ever using again out on the street
filos pointed to a mernosian number on the building

  remember you live at  filrom street in case
you lose your way you can ask to be directed the
streets are all named after ancient kings of memos
and the cross streets are all numbered from first street
up the system here is similar to that of your earth

  if there is no money why all these shops i asked

  they are not shops they are merely exhibitions
you will find that these shops constitute a regular mu-
seum of course there are a few shops such as the
tuberers and the clothiers shops and a few others but
in the main they are to show ancient costumes and
relics of the dead past

  i leaned up against a glass window to get a better
view of some of the exhibits and sprang back with an
exclamation the glass gave like rubber filos laughed
noiselessly

  our glass is flexible he said it is unbreakable
consequently no one ever gets cut on broken glass it
can be cut with a knife but as we have  such thing
as thieves here the articles would be perfectly safe if
openly exposed the glass is only for protection against
the weather as it rains here at certain seasons of the
year to a certain extent the rain is controlled by
the rain board but that is something we have not per-
fected yet we finally hope to control the precipita-
tion so that we can have it rain at will and where
needed

  we finally reached the clothiers and i picked out a
suit of dark blue tights and a dark red doublet the
clothier approved my taste and  was shown a little
room where i quickly made the change and emerged
a mernosian in apparel at least then we went to the
cappers and i was fitted with one of the conical metal
caps i was shown a button and by pressing it i had
thoughts come to me from a distance this was what
the antennae were for

  then we went to the tuberers where i was given
one of the tubes and the dependent plate which would
enable me to go through the air as did the other merno-
sians once out of the shop filos gave me the direc-
tions as to its manipulation

  you press the button on the right the left but-
ton is for a light if you are flying at night when the
left button is pressed a soft light is diffused by the
tube now how do you feel

  i felt as if all weight had left me and so informed
filos

  it has was the astounding rejoinder now think
up in the air

  i did so and immediately began to rise when i
had risen to a considerable height i began to wonder
how i would quit going up filos read my thoughts

  whatever you think will happen while you are
connected with the tube as far as motion is concerned
if you want to remain stationary think that way you
can attain any speed within reason by thinking that
speed

x

facts

when we had attained considerable height we
floated slowly back to our apartment into
the doorway and up the shaft we went and by
that time all sense of strangeness had worn off and i
was feeling a sense of exuberance at being able to
navigate the air


amazing stories

  how far up could j go i asked of filos

  as far as you could stand it the temperature on
this planet is identical with yours and you might go up
four or five miles without running short of breath
the difference between our atmosphere and yours lies
in the fact that here it is no colder ten miles above
the surface than it is on the surface the belt of vapor
begins fifteen miles above the surface and it holds out
the cold and keeps a great amount of the warmth in
this power in the tubes  how does it get to them
and where is it generated 

  the power is sent out by six different stations in
this state and is absorbed by the tubes you will no-
tice a pointed piece of white metal at each end of the
tube those are the poles for the reception of this
power which we call jorro these stations are equi-
distant from each other and should one fail to function
there would still be power coming from one of the
others to keep the tube bearers going the lights lit
and the trucks running

  where does this power come from

  from ltimidor the sun during the days of sun-
shine the essence is taken from the rays of the sun as
they are filtered through the vapor layer enough sur-
plus energy is stored however to allow for ten days
of cloudy weather but three days is the longest spell
of cloudy weather thus far known on memos

  the lights everything comes from the same en-
ergy

  yes

  i le pushed the light button and immediately the
room was bathed in sunshine a soft light that cast
 shadows seemed to come from everywhere and yet
from nowhere

  how many languages are there on memos i
asked

  spoken or written he grinned at me oddly
  spoken

  none

  none what do you mean by that

  has anyone spoken to you while you were here
a great light dawned on me we had used no lan-
guage whatever it had been thought transference and
consequently no spoken language

  i see i see but how many written languages
have you 

  just one what is known as the borozian from
borozia where it was originated borozian has been
the only language of the planet for nearly two thousand
years before that there were numerous dialects and
languages which at times was confusing to travelers
by a decree of the council of thirteen in  year
of loro one language was made universal and on
account of the predominance of the borozian it was
chosen the others soon faded away however books
in all the languages are in the great public library here
in lorenda but with each book in one of the older
languages there is a translation in borozian i must
take you to the library for it contains books ten thou-
sands of your years in age but it is late in the after-
noon and nearing night you have had a strenuous
day on memos and so you should sleep sleep is still

a necessity to a certain extent among us but we some-
times go days without it

  before you go filos tell me this doesnt it get
monotonous at times on memos with the everlasting
sameness 

  it would if it were-not for the fact that we can
send our minds at will to other planets then we have
our games we have adopted your american game of
baseball as our national sport we have found it to
be one that requires quick thinking and i would wager
that one of the teams in our league could defeat any
team you could make up on the earth if it were pos-
sible to match them life is a pleasure here and you
will find it so you will have to concentrate on send-
ing your mind from your body with our help and
advice you can master it

  filos left and i tumbled into the bed which was the
most comfortable one i havf ever slept in i slept like
a log and dreamlessly i was awakened by filos shak-
ing me he grinned as i rubbed my eyes

  it is late and i want to take you to the power-
station there is a bathroom over through that door-
way

  the bathroom was much like the earthly bathrooms
equipped with hot and cold water showers tub and
all the appliances necessary after i had bathed i felt
a glow all over my body and as soon as i located filos
i asked him about it

  that is radium energy or rather jorro all water
going into baths is charged with it it invigorates the
body and kills any fatigue that might be there

  i had almost forgotten to eat but remembered it
and went over to the food tube and soon had inhaled a
wonderful breakfast

  what will be my allotted work on memos if i
stay i asked

  as our guest from another planet you will be ex-
empt from any duty

  but that is hardly right i objected

  you were an astronomer on the earth were you
not

  yes

  then if you insist on doing something you can work-
in the national astronomy hall where the younger
generation are taught astronomy we are so far ahead
of your earth in astronomy that you will practically
have to go to school yourself our roving among
the planets and sums has given us all the knowledge
there is about the heavenly bodies we know the
largest sun which is not betelgeuse as you state on
earth but tolo off at the edge of the universe which
is twice as large as betelgeuse we know almost
all the inhabited planets of the universe you must
learn to read the written language so that you can
study up and read of wonderful and weird peoples
that inhabit other planets you have seen the people
of mars the once powerful brains that formerly dic-
tated the policies of that planet and you have met us
of memos who are the same as you in form but
i have no doubt that you will master mind-despatching
so that you too will be able to roam through space
this is a real utopia i said
mernos



  almost as near to it as is possible there can be no
crime here no deceit no envy the last crime was
committed ages ago

  i have already made up my mind as to going back
to the earth i observed

   you will be glad that you decided to stay said
filos casually

  how did you know i had decided to stay i asked
what else could you decide here is peace and
tranquility and on your earth crime discord and the
horrors of war but let us go to the power station
we went down the shaft and out into the air of
memos up we floated and then to the east soon
we were over enormous farms in the finest of order

  these farms are for raising the food that is served
you through the inhalation tube said filos those
forests that you see are for pleasure parks they are
filled with the only other kind of life there is on
memos there are sixty different specimens of birds
all wingless and voiceless except the hodo which flies
and sings a plaintive note

  werent there ever animals  memos
centuries ago the last wild animal was killed there
are no domestic animals they too were disposed of we
do not eat anything but fruits and vegetables so why
keep useless animals

  we went across the beautiful country for many
miles only low hills here and there

  are there no mountains on memos i asked
yes but not in this state around on the other side
in the state of pilaro are mountains taller than any
you have on the earth mount alos is six and a half
of your miles in the air there are no volcanoes nor
have there been in the memory of mernosians not
even a volcanic crater has been found

xi

power

a huge building loomed ahead of us about ten
miles away it was an enormous dome of pris-
 matic appearance

central power station number four said filos

  as we drew near to it i observed that it was indeed
an enormous building the dome towering six hundred
feet or more into the air and having a diameter of
five hundred feet or more at the largest part were
prisms made of crystals that shimmered in the sun

  that is what catches the rays of lumidor said
filos when we get inside you will see something
even more wonderful than the enormous globe

  we approached the building upon which the dome
rested and it was nearly seventy feet to where the
dome started from a large arched opening was in-
scribed with mernosian letters which filos translated
to me as literally meaning god gives all power
inside we were in a long hall that ran the length of
the building about seven hundred feet and was filled
with machinery the like of which i had never seen
o all four sides of this square building ran these
halls each filled with its machines we crossed the
hall and entered the huge central room and i gave a

gasp of amazement and awe under the prismatic
dome that developed every color of the rainbow sat
the most gigantic hand-made sphere that anyone had
ever seen it was of solid crystal and five hundred
feet in diameter and it towered nearly four hundred
feet above the floor

  but another thing about the crystal commanded awe
the sunlight as it was filtered through the prisms over-
head seemed to fall down over the gigantic crystal as
water falls glowing with irridescence wave after
wave of the liquid sunlight flowed to the base of the
globe and there caught in a trough that encircled
the ball ran into openings to a place below

  touch the ball said filos

  i could just reach it and i put the tip of one finger
on it immediately the wave of liquid sunshine cas-
caded over my hand and gave me a feeling of enormous
power

  dont hold your finger there too long for it will
eventually burn you said filos

  hastily i jerked my finger away and looked at it
a slight red spot was on the tip where i had touched
the crystal

  the ball reaches a hundred feet into the ground
said filos below that is an enormous pit lined with
the greenish metal which catches the energy as it pours
down over the bowl the machines that convert the
rays into power are in a huge subterranean hall below
i will take you down there later

  but how was that ball ever made i asked

  it was made in sections and put together with a
liquid cement that becomes transparent as soon as it
hardens the cutting of the parts was done with such
nicety that it would almost take a microscope to see
the places where it was joined it is a kind of crystal
that is found in profusion up near the northern pole
of the planet

  how long has the ball been here

  for two thousand years it has sat there the
machinery has been renewed at times but the crystal
ball will endure until the end of time on a cloudy
day when the suns rays are not pouring over it it
glows with a faint luminosity caused by the reflection
of the energy in the pit beneath

  then i looked beyond the sphere to the gigantic dome
that covered it gossamery it looked and i mar-
velled that so light a construction held so great a
weight

  the beams are made of girro said filos in answer
to my unspoken query it is a metal found here but
not on your earth it is tougher than your toughest
steel and almost as light as aluminum that dome
has stood there for five hundred years not that the
old dome weakened but a different arrangement of
the prisms was found that gave better results it has
now reached perfection we think the prisms are
of the same material as the great ball and are lighter
than they look here is one here hold it

  i picked up the prism and found that it indeed was
light lighter than any similar material that i had ever
seen then we went down the shaft into the machinery
hall below tn the soft glow of sunshine sat machine


amazing stories

 after machine spinning noiselessly almost in its tire-
 less task just a gentle hum was all that i could
 hear though filos complained that he could not stand
 the terrible noise any length of time the mernosian
 ear had become so unaccustomed to sounds that the
 least murmer was as the cascading of a waterfall i
 wandered through the maze of machines with filos
 lost in wonderment i shall take neither the time nor
 the space to describe the machines here if i establish
 communication with the earth i shall send a full de-
 scription of the principles upon which they work so
  that the earth may benefit

   but where they would get the crystal in such enor-
 mous quantities is beyond me unless it is possible to
 make the crystal out of glass

  then we went up to the main floor and there i
found a few machines that had an almost familiar look
there were broadcasting machines of several types
some of which i could almost understand one of the
familiar ones was the news-broadcasting machine in the
news-room here in the middle of the room was the
broadcaster its mernosian operator did not speak into
it however he merely transferred his thoughts into
it and they were carried far over the state around
the room at little tables sat mernosians with disks to
their ears and a pen and paper before them i looked
inquiringly at filos

   they are the newsgetters and each one is tuned in
 with a different sending station as soon as a bit of
 news comes in they write it on a piece of paper and
 one of the messengers takes it to the broadcaster i
 will answer your thought by saying that were the news-
 getters to convey it by thought there might be con-
 fusion afterwards all this news is printed in the
 evening papers for those who have missed the broad-
 casting

   in the play broadcasting room plays were being
 acted for the broadcasting machine that sent the plays
 everywhere this machine was beyond my compre-
 hension a play dealing with our earth was being made
 and i watched in admiration as familiar scenes were
 sent out upon the screen

   in the food broadcasting room huge vats of food
 were being cooked and the fumes gathered into enor-
 mous horns thence to be broadcast all over the state
 each day a different menu was prepared

wonders

 yow that you have seen practically all that
there is to see here i will take you to inspect

  --  one of the airships and also the airship
stations we will have to go back to lorenda for that

   almost in a daze i followed filos back to the city
 and when we reached it we went up to one of the
 enormous towers that was used as a landing for the
 freighters a huge elevator ran up the center of the
 tower to carry the freight to and from the airship
 landing these towers were all four hundred feet
 in height about a hundred feet in diameter at the base
 and seventy feet at ibe top with an overhanging plat-

 form that was a hundred feet square filos told me
 the tower ran a hundred feet into the solid ground so
 that it was firmly anchored the airships were two
 hundred feet long and the bow and stern projected
 far beyond the edges of the platform

  these ships of the air were made of the same
greenish metal and had no wings they had propellers
at the sides and at the bow and stern the ones at
the sides exerted their pressure down and helped to
keep the ship on an even keel

  how do they run i asked

  come inside invited filos

  once inside he took me to the engine or control
room after seeing the captain and getting his permis-
sion the captain was deeply interested in me when
he learned that i was guros julio the man from the
earth as he had read about my arrival in the papers
and had heard it announced over the radio i had to
answer several questions about my trip before he would
let us proceed as he had made several trips to the
earth he was interested only in the car that had carried
me through space

  in the control room i saw a tube like the one i
carried on my shoulders though it was ten times as
big the propellers were run by little motors that
had no apparent connection with anything all kinds
of instruments were seen

  the car or ship can be closed airtight said filos
then it can go clear up into the vapor belt that
renders us invisible several ships have reached a height
of fifty miles and one took a load of scientists who
tried to get samples of the vapor belt and analyze it
they got the samples but the vapor defied analyzing so
we are no farther along than we were five thousand
years ago in knowing what that belt is it is evidently
an element unknown there is no other planet that
i know of that has the same vapor except hurmos in
the solar system of the star you call polaris

  i thought i saw one of these ships coming from
the west the morning you found me i said

  probably you did if so it was coming from the
island of rinos where it had been for the alloy we
put with arror the green metal to make the tubes for
flying in no other place on this planet is it found and
the supply there will be exhausted in ten more years

  what will you do then

  bring it from povnor a satellite of jupiter wheie
it abounds

  but how will you do that  i asked in amazement

  we will build ships that will traverse space which
is not hard to do as we have an alloy now that will
destroy all gravitation we will make a large ship
or several large ships encase them with this metal
and go by planetary attraction to any planet we wish
slides on the car to expose the arror body beneath will
be the controlling method there are two of those
machines in existence that have been to povnor and
have brought back a load of the dunor as it is called
they came near being all killed on povnor as the
superstitious inhabitants thought they were demons

  then that is what the patrot meant when he said
that a way was open for me to return to the earth

i
mernos

i

  exactly and we will make such a car if you
hesire to return to the earth

  i have overcome all desire for that my only
desire now is to stay on mernos and to master mind-
traveling

  one is easily satisfied grinned filos but the
other is a more difficult proposition it rests with you
however

  i wandered through the big airship and saw that it
was built for freight only of course no passengers
would want to travel for the tubes would take them
where they wanted to go then we went down through
the air to the ground again and back to my apartment
and once there filos brought in some books and taught
me the mernosian characters there were twenty-seven
characters and as many sounds in the language

               xiii	

mind travel

    then got him to tell me what he could of travel-
    ing with the mind alone

       concentration is the secret of it all it will take
you a long time to master it but i believe that you can
do it you have a powerful mind sit each day and
think think think of sending your mind on a journey

  but if i get my mind out of my body can i return
easily 

  that is the easiest thing of all for the mind always
wants to return to the body you will have difficulty
in keeping the mind away from the body at first

  do the children have this power

  once in a while an infant prodigy masters it at
the age of around ten of our years or twenty of yours
but very seldom it is never mastered thoroughly
until about sixty of your years in age

  i am not going to describe the time i spent in trying
to separate my mind from my body i had not succeeded
at the end of six months and had about made up my
mind to give it up as apparently i was not far enough
advanced to master it

  dont give up said filos when i told him this
it may come to you suddenly when you least
expect it

  i determined to try it one week more it was the last
day of the week i had set and suddenly i was looking
down at my seated body in the chair i had succeeded
at last where should i go on my first journey back
to the earth yes that was what i would do as i
hovered there in indecision filos came into the room

  ah he has succeeded at last i knew he would
was his mental comment

  i stood in the astral upon the planet that i had
left all around me was desolation and devastation
huge holes torn in the bosom of the earth and villages
in ruin not a sign of life what had happened i
fled the scene of desolation and then i saw the cause
i was upon a vast battlefield and the armies of europe
were tearing at their foes it was in eastern france

  upon one side waved the tricolor of france the
union jack of england and the yellow red and black
of belgium the flag of russia with its blue cross

was also there on the other side the flags of austria
and germany floated side by side i noted with pride
that the fighting was on french soil and i thought that
we were destined to win but why say we i was
not a mundane being any more i was a mernosian

  yet a feeling of sadness came over me as i watched
the ghastly struggle so many brave men were going to
their deaths for what if only the peace of mernos
could be implanted upon this war-torn world yet
there was one country at peace and it was prosperous
in that country lay the salvation of the earth that
country was america where the lowliest man had a
chance to rise where ability and not nobility ruled

i returned to mernos and found filos in the room
as i reanimated rriy body he grinned in happiness

  you have succeeded at last i told you you would
now it will be easier and easier until you can leave
and return at will where did you go

  to julio

  and you found 

  a world torn with wars no peace on the eastern
hemisphere

  nor will it be entirely confined to the eastern hemi-
sphere guros we of mernos have followed the war
as it progressed and we can see the writing on the
wall as you on the earth would say you will have
to explain that saying to me some day for i have heard
of the handwriting on the wall numerous times the
united states will be forced into the war but on whose
side i do not know whatever side she assists will
win

  what makes you think that

  just the march of events

  i do not feel as i thought i would i thought that
i would be filled with bitterness for the enemies of
germany and patriotism for the fatherland but that
thought has been submerged in the sorrow that such
things should be oh that they could have a taste of
the peace of mernos

  already you are more mernosian than jullonian
smiled filos and ere long you will like us look upon
the people of the earth as beings groping in a benighted
age but they will make up after the war and while
this war will not be the last yet the way will be paved
for peace not until the big countries of the earth
lay aside their greed and love of domination will total
peace come to your world kings and dictators must
g-

  but will this utopia ever come to the earth i
asked

  as certainly as it has come to mernos but the
years it will take may have to be counted by the thous-
ands still from what i know of the past history of
mernos we were once as badly off as your earth now
is once war after war devastated the planet it
culminated in the great war of all nations about five
thousand years ago then began to come peace and
common sense then the ability to read minds came
as a boon and no one could hide his guilt if he had
any thus died crime and envy and discord and with
it all such things leaving friendship and brotherly love
poverty died with the progress of the mind and we


amazing stories

now stand all millionaires for we have all that we
desire and no man hoards his pile to the detriment of
his fellow man

   again i say it is utopian

  aye and more

  god grant that it may come to the earth and soon
but i will not live to see it

  not in the body but in the spirit you will or in
another body for the soul never dies

  how fortunate i am to be here

xiv

roaming

as the days fled by i became more and more expert
in separating my mind from my body and at
- last it was without an effort that i did so i
must say something of the things i saw on other planets
and satellites before i close this message and send it to
the world

  i even stood upon the sun and there i saw why it
could shine with undiminished energy through billions
of years and would do so for countless ages more it
is not a place of flames and fire it is a ball of radium
energy with which the suns rays are filled thus giving
life to the peoples and the vegetation of the far-off
spheres i sensed that the temperature of the sun was
the intense cold of space and as i stood there the rays
of energy crossed and recrossed above my head shoot-
ing out into the blackness for thousands upon thousands
of miles the sunspots were merely places where a
deposit of some kind impervious to the rays held
them down

  i exulted as i thought that i was the first of the
earth people to get the real solution of the mystery of
the sun and i must tell it here so that it will be a
mystery no more but will i be believed  i am afraid
not though a man of science should know it must be
true for otherwise the sun would have been burned out
ages ago and very few suns burn out

  jupiter the immense i hung above the planet and
looked down upon a gaseous planet that was in the
proccss of formation here and there the bank of
vapors would break and i would get a glimpse of the
semi-molten surface of the giant planet at times it
would boil and bubble and then it would seem to be
almost solid many ages would have to pass before this
planet became habitable there were nine moons
around this great planet and i explored them all to
my astonishment i found that one two-thirds the size
of mars was inhabited but such inhabitants they
were about five feet tall with the bodies of lizards and
the heads of frogs their attenuated legs were three
feet long ending in a frog-like foot the heads while
like a frogs differed in that their eyes were mere slits
and upon their heads was a coarse reddish hair the
arms were so long that they almost touched the ground
and ended in six-fingered hands with double-jointed
fingers they breathed through the mouth which was
always open

   in mentality they were like the cave dwellers of the
earth of ages ago they spoke in a queer piping

voice and their thoughts were simple and easily read
clothing was not a part of their equipment and  the
women had longer hair  their heads than the men
did they called jupiter which filled about a fourth of
their visible sky muzit and it was supposed to be
where they went when they died i have since decided
that this was the jupiterian moon known to earth as-
tronomers as ganymede and by the inhabitants zitzo
our sun was sometimes seen as a bright bright star
dimmed by the overpowering brightness of jupiter
they lived in mud huts in which they had enormous
fireplaces and an abnormal lot of filth

  i visited all of the planets of our solar system on
saturns moons i found the peoples to be our kind
but dressing and living as in the time of julius caesar

i went to the uttermost ends of our own universe
out past the last huge sun and its attendant planets

  filos it is wonderful i remarked to that person
one day

  yet it has ceased to seem that way to us we take
it as a matter of course countless trips through space
have taken off the glamor it is true that it never gets
monotonous for there are millions of different planets
to visit but it is done so easily that we have lost all
idea of its being marvelous

  i dont think i will cease to think it marvelous 
i said

  yes you will the time will come when you too
will consider it commonplace

  are there any other planets as far advanced as
memos 

  many and one that seems to be even farther ad-
vanced that one is far off opar a planet of one of
the gigantic suns that hover in outer space near to
the end of the universe it is so near that at certain
times of its year the night sky is almost devoid of stars
but two or three are further away than opar we
call that sun onaro but it can not be seen from here
nor from your earth there the people are as happy
as we are as peaceful and contented but they have
advanced one step further they can not only project
the mind to another world they can usurp the body of
a dweller in another planet we know that for one
of them did it here that is how we learned about 
opar	

 i shall go to opar	

  it will be well worth your while opar is like
mernos ruled as one big country by a council of
sixteen they use the power of their sun as we do
and in kirol they have a crystal hall one-third larger
than the one you saw but their crystal is hewn from
the solid substance instead of having been built up
like ours

i was in opar opar the magnificent it was at
at night but instead of the starry sky i was wont
to see only three stars were in sight and the moon of
opar but to describe that moon not a yellowish
golden sphere as is our moon but a thing of still
greater beauty a bright bluish green it cast a soft
glow over the landscape that lay before me bringing -
into relief the gossamery buildings that comprised the
mernos



beautiful city in which i stood bigger than our moon
by a third and moving majestically across the heavens
with a speed that almost made her motion visible it
was a glorious sight long i stood and reveled in
the beauty of the satellite ere i turned my attention to
the city in which i stood then i looked around me
shimmering in the soft light were tall buildings that
seemed to have an irridescence of their own

  they towered in the air majestically large at the
base and gradually worked in something on the order
of a pyramid there wasa uniformity about them
and none were unsightly nor were there any low
buildings all rose to an average height of at least three
hundred feet the moons rays were reflected back
from the pavements in irridescent splendour for the
pavements seemed to be made of a material with a sheen
to it late as it seemed to be the streets were not
devoid of people here and there oparians were com-
ing and going and i examined them closely they
were like the people of the earth except that the ears
were very small almost gone they were about as
delicate featured as the mernosians

  in the glow of the speeding moon i wandered
through the magnificent city that was about twice as
large as lorenda and viewed many a magnificent park
and lake here and there in large squares were
pieces of statuary that would put most of the statuary
of the earth to shame some of the groups were ap-
parently allegorical and some statues seemed to be of
famous oparians naught however that wouldbring
to mind warfare or strife those things had ceased to
be for so long that they were not even commemorated
by a statue

  like memos only beauty and peace and calmness
reigned yet i could not see that this planet was any
further along than memos except for the fact that
they had learned to usurp a body upon another planet
undoubtedly this would be accomplished on memos
also when the giant sun onaro cast its rays upon the
now sleeping city i returned to memos

message

i went to filos not long after this and was about
to speak about the feasibility of getting into com-
munication with the earth when he got ahead of
me to say that the council of nine requested my
presence as soon as it was convenient for me to attend
i wondered what it was for and began to try to
remem vr if i had in any way violated any of the
laws of memos we found the council in session
as i told filos that i was ready to go at once the
patrot addressed me as i stood before them

   guros julio you have been  this planet for close
to one of your years and we called you before us to
ascertain if you wished to stay or wished us to give
you assistance to get back to the planet that you left
the choice lies with you and should you decide in
favor of your home planet we will give you every
assistance in our power

  we invite you to stay among us to the end of your
days but the desires of  your own heart come first

  worthy patrot and members of the council of
nine my mind has been made up for many days i
have no desire to go back to the place of warfare
and strife and envy and discord from whence i came
i will stay on memos if it pleases you

  it is well now there is a chance for you to get
a message to the people of the earth mind communi-
cation seems to be impossible the only communica-
tion that seems possible now is one by which a written
message will be given them i think it can be done
in the great museum at dovenla is an instrument that
was once used to shoot messages to mars in a vain
attempt to communicate with that body this was
before mind transference had become an accomplished
fact we knew that the messages reached mars but
none were ever found now we can use that instru-
ment to send a message to the earth tell us your
message or better still you can write it and we will
have it copied nine times by our special process this
will give you ten messages at least one of them
should be found

  thank you i will write my message at once and
yet i feel that if it is found it will be received with
skepticism and doubt

  it will probably be so but some may believe

  we left the council chamber and went to my apart-
ment where there was writing material in profusion
but filos objected to my using any of the paper that
was there and he produced some very thin but exceed-
ingly tough sheets and a special ink

  this ink and paper will stand being heated in incan-
descence without being harmed thus if the cylinder
you are to send gets overheated in the atmosphere of
the earth and it surely will no harm will be done to
the contents besides it will be enclosed in a case
of ludo which is like your glass but flexible you
have seen it in the show windows

  what will the tube be made of

  a special alloy that will not melt at less than 
of your temperature you call fahrenheit now you
can write your message and i will have it copied not
only nine times but more one copy with a transla-
tion will go to the great library of lorenda to be placed
in the archives there we will shoot ten copies to the
earth and if one of them is not found we will shoot
ten more constant shooting may at last place one
where it will be discovered

  so i am writing this message to the earth to be
copied many times the messages are all the same
except for the opening sentence which tell the order
in which the cylinders are sent out it took me a long
time to write this message for i am not a writer there
may be some slight discrepancies in the tale but they
are easily explained i will make daily trips to the
earth as the tubes are shot forth and watch for publi-
cation of the fact that a tube has been found

  finder of this tube will you not see that publication
of the fact is made in the berlin staats-zeitung i
sball scan the copies of that paper each day for informa-
tion let the news of the finding be upon the first
page of that paper where it can be easily seen i

by a h johnson

y world is - far different from yours a
hundred years ago my story would have
been utterly unintelligible to you but
your science has made such strides that to-
day much of my story will be entirely clear
to all there arc still many things however that the
scientists of your outer world do not know perhaps
my story may shed light on some of these things

  my earliest recollections are of ceaseless movement
i floated in a fast moving current through a series of
passages or tunnels the fluid in which i floated held
many other beings besides myself we were all of
shapes and of contours that would amaze you of the
outer world

  the size of the passages varied continually the
very smallest were too small for me to enter while a
great number were only a little larger than myself
from these smaller ones they ranged te a size o large
that many hundreds of beings like myself could move
through them at once in the smaller corridors the
low of the stream was slow but in the larger ones it
was very rapid and in four of the largest tunnels
it boiled with terrific speed

  these passages had a number of inhabitants most
of them floated free in the stream but a few lived
around the edges of the tunnels i belonged to what
i will call the white race few or none of the other
animals were as large as we our bodies were oval or
round in shape and somewhat flat  the upper and
lower sides giving us a disk-like appearance the
fluid in which we lived completely filled the tunnels
and we lived in it somewhat
as the fish of your world
live in the sea we had a
number of very small and
thin arms or limbs and by
means of these we swam
in the stream we could
neither speak nor hear but
by means of a sense which
you do not have we were
able to communicate with
one another for the sake
of making my history clear
to you i will refer to our
means of communication as speech we were not the
most numerous species in our world the red race
outnumbered us hundreds to one they resembled us
in appearance except that they were even more disk-
like and they were only from two-thirds to one-half
as large as we also while we were white in color
they were a brilliant red

  in addition to the red race and ourselves thsre
were numerous other species most of these other ani-

they varied in size from one-sixth the size of the
red race to a few species slightly larger than the
reds some were spherical in shape others resembled
a curved twisted or straight cylinder most of them
had tentacles or arms which enabled them to swim
under normal conditions these smaller animals formed
only one-half of one per cent or less of the inhabitants
of the tunnels some of them were entirely harmless
but many were very ferocious and attacked the red
race savagely the red race could not fight it was
their duty to keep the tunnels in good condition and
carry food to certain animals that lived around the
smaller tunnels they also removed certain waste
products from the stream keeping it pure it was
our duty to protect the red race for we knew that
if enough of them were killed the impurities in the
stream would increase and we would be unable to live
thus our two races were mutually dependent neither
could exist without the other

  i did not know all this at first my memory of my
earlier days only contains a record of passively floating
through the passages and absorbing food from the
surrounding stream but gradually i grew in size
and became more active also my knowledge increased
i began to learn my way about some of the larger pas-
sages the smaller passages were so numerous that i
despaired of ever knowing one ten-thousandth of them
but they were not so important to be known as were
the larger passages for the current was so swift in
the larger passages that it was impossible to swim
against it and one could only control ones destina-
tion by choosing the branch
passages to go into the
current swept in a great
circle through the tunnels
it went from the larger
tunnels to the smaller and
then through the smallest
and these small tunnels
were innumerable in quan-
tity  then it went into larger
ones and then through the
largest and then through
the smaller again and so 
around the circle but the
length of the circuit varied greatly according to the
passages one took some of these passages were so
long and circuitous that it was possible to make only
a few circuits through them in a life time others were
very short	 

  before preached my full growth i learned how -to
attack our enemies whom we called ancytes all of
our race were great fighters we had  other duties or

                                                     pastimes than fighting and we thought- nothing of
trials were hostile to us and to the red race and it tacklingthreeor four ofthe largest speciesof ancytes
was our duty to see that they did not become numerous or a dozen of the smaller species of our manner of

 t is usually the things nearest to us that we know least
 about humanity lived for thousands of years until
 finally only a short term of years ago the scientist william
 harvey discovered that there was such a thing as blood
 circulation

    tlic present story is really not a romance because prac-
 tically  per cent of the story is fact maybe the present
 story will be the forerunner of others to show us what is
 going on in that great mysterious machine called the
 human body

here no doubt is an unusual story that caps the climax


the nars were poshed back some distance into the labyrinth but they soon rallied and returned to the attack the stream
was filled with bits of bodies and the red race had been almost exterminated in these places their absence meant that the
stream was becoming impure this was worse for us than for the nars for the stream flowed from them to us




amazing stories

fighting you shall learn later when i describe the great
invasion since we were so superior to the ancytes
in fighting you may wonder how we could ever be in
danger from them but as a matter of fact we were
always in danger and ceaseless vigilance and activity
were necessary to preserve our existence our danger
was due to the great powers of multiplication possessed
by the ancytcs if only a small group of them were
allowed to breed undisturbed in some remote passage-
way they would in a short time emerge in immense
multitudes and we knew that if we were sufficiently
outnumbered we would be unable to cope with them

  so we scattered ourselves far and wide through the
passages and tried to keep every smallest alcove under
watch whenever any of the ancytes were discovered
we either hunted them down and destroyed them by
ourselves or if they were too numerous we signaled
to as many of our comrades as necessary to join in
the hunt

  exactly where the ancytes came from we did not
know it was from somewhere in the great outside
they either obtained entrance through breaks in the
wall of the passages or through places where the walls
were very thin in the smaller passages they prac-
tically always appeared in the smaller tunnels there
were two sets of passages where they were particularly
likely to appear we kept strict watch over both of
these and as they were far removed from each other
we kept a good force near each

  the worst of these two sets of passages was almost
boundless in extent and we called it the black labyrinth
because of the endless tunnels it contained and because
the ancytes that appeared in it were usually dark in
color the other we called narrow places because of
the small size of the passages

i had attained full growth and considerable knowl-
edge and experience when the dark day of our
race dawned i was floating quietly near one of the
entrances to the black labyrinth when the word came
that the bors one of the most active but smaller species
of ancytes had appeared in considerable numbers ill
the narrow places i knew at once that the situation
must be serious or even the news of such an event
would not have reached us for if the number of
white soldiers near the narrow places had been suffi-
cient to deal with the situation they would never have
said anything about it

  i and a number of other while warriors moved
toward the larger passages where the current would
carry us toward the narrow places the dark laby-
rinth and the narrow places were almost at opposite
ends of the passages and it was a long journey from
one to the other the circular motion of the current
made it possible to choose such passages as always to
have the current in ones favor in moving from one
place to the other were it not for this fact a con-
siderable portion of a lifetime would have been ex-
pended in such a journey

  we moved from the smaller passages into the larger
where the current moved very swiftly in the largest
of the passages the current boiled and foamed with

speed and we did not attempt swimming all our
efforts were expended in preventing ourselves from
either bumping into the wall or into each other the
larger tunnels were so big that as long as one did not
attempt to move off into branch passages there was
little danger of bumping into the walls but we fre-
quently had to make turns and if one were thrown
against the walls at this speed it meant serious injury
or death

  as we approached the smaller passages near the
narrow places the current slowed down and we were
again able to swim we moved slowly forward for
we knew we would receive word if there was any
very pressing need of assistance we considered the
bors very troublesome but not very dangerous they
were too small to constitute a real threat against us
unless in such numbers as to literally block the passages
with their bodies

  we began to notice signs of them as we approached
the narrow places these signs were small bits of
members of the red race who had been devoured by
the bors the red race could not desert these pas-
sages without allowing the stream to become so filled
with impurities as to prevent our living in it and
they stuck nobly to their work in the face of this
danger

  before entering the narrow places we decided to
make use of the fact that although the passages through
the narrow places were innumerable the entrances
were few thus the stream entered the narrow places
rather as a stream in your world might enter a marsh
and flow through the marsh in innumerable small
streams to combine into one again we posted guards
at the entrances in order to confine the bors to this sec-
tion of the passages then we slowly advanced upon
them

  we found that the white soldiers already present
were winning even without our aid the bors had
been pressed back into the smallest of the passages and
were being slowly run down and exterminated the
litter in the stream showed however that a consider-
able fight was taking place thousands of the red
race had been destroyed and the stream was thick with
small pieces of the bors we saw no white dead
many of the white soldiers had however temporarily
withdrawn from the battle to digest such of our enemies
as they had seized we fight by grasping our enemies
with our tentacles and eating them we do not eat
as you eat with a particular section of the body we
can eat with our whole body and we curl around and
envelope whatever we eat whenever we have envel-
oped all we can digest we withdraw to digest it and
then return to the fight we could not afford to do
as you do in attacking an enemy that is merely injure
him enough to kill for the bodies would soon litter the
passages so as to hamper movement also the bodies
of the ancytes if left exposed to the stream produce
a mixture that is poisonous to us we must not only
kill but also destroy the body

we divided into small groups in order to search
the innumerable small passages i and three other
phagocytes



of our race were moving slowly along a small passage
when far in front we saw several bors instantly we
dashed forward with the bors fleeing before us we
pursued them through many winding tunnels until at
last we knew we were approaching the further edge
of the narrow places we knew then that we had them
cornered for the entrances to both sides of the narrow
places were held by our men the bors knew it too
and seeing our small numbers they turned in a savage
effort to break through us and double back on their
path there were perhaps twenty of them

  the passage here was only wide enough for two of
us to stand abreast so i and the largest of the other
three of our men stood in front and the other two just
behind us the bors were only about one-sixth of our
size and bulk but they were equipped with sharp teeth
as well as the tentacles we had they were shaped like
a short squat rod with a knot on one end this knot
was their head and contained their teeth they swam
forward in a mass and attacked savagely i seized
three at once and began to envelope and kill them i
could feel their sharp teeth tearing at me and even bit-
ing off small pieces but i come of a hardy race and
in order to kill me it would have been necessary to
tear me entirely apart my comrade had seized four of
the bors and was handling them easily i grabbed
two more and the end of this group of the enemy seemed
well in sight for we had not yet called on the two
soldiers we had in reserve but at this time we heard
a noise in the passage behind us and saw some thirty
of the bors coming rapidly towards us they were
evidently pursued by another group of our soldiers

  this meant that we were caught between two fires
the bors behind us would fight desperately believing
that if they could break through us they could escape
there was only one thing to do and that was to attack
the bors in front and either annihilate them or force
them to retreat to the entrance of the narrow places
where the guards would annihilate them and come to
our assistance

  we charged at once and the bors were forced back
a short distance but they understood the situation and
did not retreat far there were only eleven of them
now but my comrade was rather badly torn and i was
somewhat tired we each seized two of them and
then retired a little to let our two fresh soldiers attack
they accounted for four more but while they did so
the bors from behind reached us eight of them seized
my wounded comrade and literally tore him into small
pieces only twelve of them could come abreast so
only four were left to attack me i grasped two and
on my friends seeing the situation one of them came
to my assistance leaving the other to finish the remain-
ing three bors between us and the entrance to the nar-
row places the situation seemed desperate when i
saw a line of white warriors sweeping down on the
rear of the twenty-eight bors behind us now it was
they that were held in a trap and the slaughter was
sudden and complete the white warriors charged into
the bors with the impunity and deadly effect of tanks
among infantry not one of the bors escaped

  scenes like these were taking place all through the

narrow places and continued to take place for over
one life-span of the bors we have no measurement
of time similar to your days and years our environ-
ment never changes to correspond to your days and
nights or seasons if it did we would probably die
our only measurement of time is the duration of our
lives and those of the animals about us we live about
twenty times as long as the bors thus this war with
them took about three of your years

amazing stories

most of the fighting was done in the first part
of the war and the latter part was more a mere
hunt but the passages were so numerous that almost
our entire force was required to search them thor-
oughly we could not divide into groups of less than
five or six for fear of coming on some such situation
as we had encountered in the first part of the war we
were determined to do the work thoroughly and in
order to do so withdrew our patrols from the black
labyrinth which had been unusually quiet during the
bors war the only precaution we took with regard
to the black labyrinth was to leave strong guards at
all entrances we were to regret this negligence sadly
later

  we finished the war in excellent shape we lost
less than a hundred soldiers and most of these were
killed in circumstances similar to those in which the
warrior with me had been killed with this small loss
we had completely exterminated the bors it was true
that many thousands of the red race had been killed
but they were so numerous that the losses could hardly
be noticed also they were a prolific race and their
natural increase soon filled the gaps

  we had hardly finished the bors war however when
the red race brought the most dire news their work
had carried them through the black labyrinth and
they reported that the most dreaded of the ancytes
the nars were present there in great numbers the
nars were fully twice the size of the bors and much
more savage and active in addition they had a weapon
not possessed by the bors they could throw off from
their bodies a poison which if present in the stream
in sufficient quantities would first paralyze and then
kill us it was also deadly to the red race

  leaving only a small contingent to guard the nar-
row places the rest of our soldiers headed at once
for the channels where the current flowed toward the
dark labyrinth we had hardly started before we
received further and worse news

  the nars had attacked the guards at both entrances
of the dark labyrinth and they were so numerous
that it was feared that their attack would succeed
they were attacking the guards at the far entrances
with particular fury

  this meant a very grave situation for us for it
would be long before help could reach the guards at
the far entrances the course of the stream was
from the set of entrances of the narrow places where
we now were toward the near entrances of the dark
labyrinth then through the dark labyrinth and out
the far entrances and so around to the other entrances
to the narrow places thus in order to reach the far
entrances to the dark labyrinth it would be neces-
sary either to go through the dark labyrinth which
was swarming with nars or to swim against the cur-
rent and go back by the same route through which we
had come to the narrow places or and this was the
only route that left any hope of reaching the far
entrances in time to be of any use to follow the cur-
rent on past the near entrances of the dark labyrinth
and on beyond the labyrinth where it curved around
in a great half circle and finally came back by the

far entrances by following this route we would
have the current with us all the way but it was so
extremely long that we doubted if we could arrive
in time

  still since this was our only chance we determined
to take it a third of our force composed of the ablest
fighters and fastest swimmers was sent to follow this
route the rest followed in a more leisurely manner
they were to attack the nars from the near entrances
of the labyrinth

i formed part of the advance force we swam
rapidly forward hunting for the channels where
the current moved with terrible speed we did not
merely float with it but aided our progress by swim-
ming the turns were taken at a desperate pace and
several of our number were crushed at almost every
turn but we did not hesitate for we knew that if
the nars broke past the guard at the far entrances
they would spread through the whole stream and we
would never be able to beat them the stream whirled
and seethed around us but we still continued our mad
pace then we were moving through the smaller and
slower passages and were more than halfway to the
near entrances next we approached the near en-
trances we saw no sign of the struggle that must
be going on for the current flowed away from us and
carried such signs toward the far entrances

  then we shot past the near entrances in a brief
glimpse we saw hundreds of our warriors grouped
near them we later learned that the attack on them
had merely been strong enough to prevent them from
sending aid to the guards at the other gates

  the passages that go beyond and around the dark
labyrinth are small and we had little benefit from the
current in moving through them we went at the top
of our speed we must reach the far entrances while
our guards still held them or our race was doomed
the red workers who were drifting through the pas-
sages were glad to see our warriors and told us that
the guards at the near entrances were standing firm
but they had no news from the far entrances

  on we swept three-fourths of our journey was
done the passages were again becoming larger and
the current added to our speed our warriors were
spread out in a straggling line with the fastest swim-
mers in front the slower swimmers were thoroughly
exhausted and a stop was determined upon to allow
them to rest before attacking the nars but a fourth
of our group composed of the fastest swimmers de-
cided to proceed without a pause

  i formed part of this group leaving the rest of
our party we moved on soon we were approaching
the far entrances we made a momentary pause to
reorganize just before turning the last curve before
reaching the far entrances then we rushed on

  as we turned the curve a terrible sight met our eyes
we had left over a thousand of our best warriors to
guard these entrances now we saw perhaps a hundred
and fifty badly torn and wounded white warriors slowly
giving way before a swarm of nars the passage into
the black labyrinth was very large it was big enough
phagocytes



to allow two hundred of our soldiers to stand abreast
our hundred and fifty warriors were a short distance
down this passage and slowly retreating towards us
the nars are egg-shaped with numerous arms or legs
looking somewhat like an egg with a ragged fringe
around it the fringe is composed of their legs or
tentacles the nars have powerful teeth and jaws
and they were using them against our soldiers with
deadly effect the stream was filled with bits of the
red race and pieces of our soldiers and of the nars
it was apparent that our soldiers were practically beaten
but they still held the entrance

  we dashed into the fight at once and at first we
were uniformly successful the nars were pushed
back some distance into the labyrinth but they soon
rallied and returned to the attack the stream was
filled with bits of bodies and the red race had been
almost exterminated in these places their absence
meant that the stream was becoming impure this was
worse for us than for the nars for the stream flowed
from them to us

  then the nars began to use their poisonous emis-
sions many of our white warriors were partially para-
lyzed and some killed we were forced to draw back
to the outer edges of the entrances so that the pure
stream which flowed around the dark labyrinth would
wash away the poisons

   the nars seeing only a short distance between them
and the open stream attacked with renewed ferocity
we were entirely outnumbered we had some 
warriors already at the far entrances and  more
were due to arrive but the nars were numberless
and as fast as we killed off the front ranks others
replaced them

  this could not go on long when one of our war-
riors was attacked by ten or more of the nars his
fate was sealed at once our front rank was melting
away we could not retreat for to do so would turn
the nars loose in the stream so our soldiers died
where they stood half of them had been killed and
many more partially or wholly disabled by the nars
poisons when our main force came up they at once
took over the battle while we received a brief rest

  we soon saw that even these numbers would be
insufficient to hold back the nars for more than a short
time where was the rest of our force why were
they not attacking the near entrances and sweeping
through the labyrinth to fall on the rear of the nars
that attacked us unless they completed some such
maneuver speedily we would be finished we would
not retreat while we lived but there would come a time
and that time was not far off when there would be
none of us alive

   we were ordered back into the battle i was in the
fifth rank and so far entirely unhurt

   i watched the nars sweep against the first rank in
a raging mass the line seemed to dissolve under their
attack the second rank moved forward through the
floating pieces of bodies to take their place the stream
was becoming even more filled with bits of our war-
riors and pieces of the nars as i have told you we

not only killed the nars but destroyed their bodies
by eating them but when one of our warriors who
had seized several of the nars was torn in pieces the
bits of the nars were turned loose in the stream

next the second rank was destroyed and the third
moved up to take its place our warriors seized
and enveloped thousands of the nars but still they came
on in apparently undiminished numbers for every-
one of our soldiers killed five or six of the nars must
have died but still the nars came on

  soon i was in next to the front rank and then we
moved up to the front itself i was at the very end
of the line with the passage wall on my left and this
fact gave me some protection i seized two of them

  only four thousand of our warriors were left now
and many of these were both wounded and gorged with
the bodies of the nars this gorged condition made
our soldiers inactive the nars for some reason
ceased pressing the attack for a short time we after-
wards found that they were holding a council

  then they came forward with renewed energy and
in even greater numbers the rest had done our war-
riors good and we met them with greater ferocity than
their own our front rank charged them savagelv
and pushed them far back into the labyrinth

  but this proved our undoing for our front rank
went past several side passages and the nars came out
of these side passages and attacked them in the rear
not one of them came back

  the nars encouraged by their destruction of our
front rank attacked with increased vigor we knew
that we could not hold out much longer

  but at last the longed-for event happened we heard
the sound of fighting far back in the labyrinth it
could mean but one thing our troops had fought tlieir
way through the labyrinth and would soon arrive to
support us the nars were caught between us and
were in a trap but would the walls of the trap hold 

  the nars realized the situation and attacked with
a wild and desperate abandon that made their previous
efforts seem tame no longer did they spar for open-
ings with our warriors somewhat as a wolf attacks an
elk in your world now they rushed right in knowing
that the first three or four would be killed under
such tactics our soldiers melted away like snow before
the sun soon there were only six hundred of us left
we stood in three ranks it seemed to be almost over

  but in spending their energy in attacking us the
nars had left their rear almost unguarded and our
main force composed of some twenty thousand soldiers
was sweeping them before them fully three-fourths
of the nars turned to hold off this force while the
rest were to finish us but the rest were insufficient to
finish us we held our own the nars were finished

  they broke before the attack of our main body and
fled down various side passages then two thousand
of our warriors forced their way through and rein-
forced us after that we hunted them down as we
had hunted the bors

  we had won

            grassy treeless plain for the most part
smooth and level swept off to the far hori-
zon across its surface a few small bodies
of water were scattered quiet and motion-
less in the drowsy sunlight northward a
cliff rose abruptly from the peaceful level of the sur-
rounding country trailing off on either side out of
sight it appeared to consist of some hard rock such
as granite and was much worn by water its surface
being studded with the mouths of caves and small
queerly carved out-thrustings of its strata upon the
summit of the cliff grew a lush and semi-tropical vege-
tation in direct contrast to the plain this plant-life
consisted of a brilliantly colored undergrowth and tall
peculiar looking trees all of which followed the trend
of the cliff and vanished in the distance over this
quiet and peaceful scene the mellow and hazy sun
beamed while primitive-looking insects droned and
hummed in the undergrowth of plain and cliff alike
suddenly the quiet was broken by a scream of fearful
agony at the edge of one of the lakes a horrible bony-
scaled fish-like creature with blank expressionless
eyes had seized upon an over-sized amphibian and was
mechanically chewing him in half the fish dragged
its victim below the surface and the screaming ceased
the scene was not as peaceful as it appeared long be-
fore this the unending cycle 

had begun	

   such was the greater part
of the continent of north
america five million years
ago when time was nearing
what is known as the end of
the cretaceous period and

preparing the workl for the	-

advent of the domination

of mammals at that era of formation the great amer-
ican continent was being constantly flooded over vast
areas by a shallow half warm sea which was just as
constantly drained off again the withdrawal of the
sea left great expanses of treeless plains with here and
there on ground which had not been submerged large
forests of the weird vegetation of that period there
was also animal life with the inrushing seas came the
marine life and the amphibian giants who had ages
before lost their world dominance and had not yet come
to their final extinction with the rising of the land and

the draining off of the waters came the land animals
the kings of the earth following their environment
always

   during this period came the lull just before the ter-
 rific glacial ages which followed it in rapid succession
 the climate was mild and warm there were no great
 upheavals or floods and it was in this setting that the
 dinosaurs played their last great part in the drama of
 life and gave over world dominion to the mammals
 theirs was a glorious farewell indeed for they cul-
 minated their race which was the greatest of all the
 orders of the reptiles and their carnivores were the
 mightiest beasts of prey that ever walked the earth
 and the mightiest of these the most terrible engine
 of destruction known to the history of the world was
 tyranosaurus rex king of the tyrant lizards

   as the scream ceased the monstrous ferns and other
 foliages upon the cliffs edge parted and into the cheer-
 ful sunlight stepped tyranosaurus rex he walked
 upright as did all carnivorous dinosaurs and his ugly
 cruel head with its incredibly powerful jaws towered
 a full eighteen feet above the earth his fore limbs
 were much shorter than his hind legs and wert carried
 as a man would his hands all four feet were armed
 with long curved claws any of which could rip open
 an enemy from jowl to ilank in one lightning-like
 stroke in the hind limbs were also the tremendous
 running and jumping muscles capable of carrying the
 heavy body over the ground at a speed that was truly
 marvelous his body though ponderous was compact
 and lithe hiding within it muscles that were the boast
 of nature while to finish it off was a long and weighty
  but easily handled tail

amazing stories

approached the feeding saurian the latter a mon-
strous grotesque beast heavy of body and legs but
with an inconceivably elongated neck and tiny head
stood on all fours plucking and eating the succulent
roots and grasses at the lake side from time to time
his head and neck writhed above the surrounding tall
rush-like vegetation as he watched for possible ene-
mies at such times the great beast stalking him would
cease all motion holding himself tense in the peculiar
manner of reptiles skin loose but muscles held like
corded steel when he had reached the limitations
of the taller rushes tyranosaurus gathered his hind
limbs under him the final move before the charge
this was not a test of strength he was about to enter
but a trial of speed the herbivore had no valid means
of defending itself against the meat eater and so de-
pended upon its ability to reach the comparative safety
of the lake into which tyranosaurus would not follow
him just as the latter was prepared to leap his prey
raised its head for another wary inspection slowly
the ridiculously small head turned to take in all of the
scene was about to sink to its feast of grasses again
when it stopped short and stood as though frozen

  steadily the two great beasts stared at each other
resembling fantastically carved rocks in their motion-
lessness  an easy roaming wind sighed aud rustled
among the rush tops and a weird throbbing cry floated
across the serene surface of the lake then the tension
broke and the gigantic saurians sprang into action
with a dry sibilant hiss the carnivore flashed across
the clearing in great earth-shaking bounds while the
grass-eater charged at amazing speed for so ponderous
a creature toward the shore of the lake fast as he
was tyranosaurus was even faster and not ten feet
from the shore sprang fairly upon his victims back
there was a moment of thunderous crashing an in-
tense high-pitched screaming and then the violently
agitated rushes resumed their tranquil bowing to the
idling wind tyranosaurus rex had once more proved
his right to kingship

while the kings of the earth roamed and fought
over the forming surface of their world the fate
of an entire race hung on the word of one individual
some two hundred and forty thousand miles away was
the moon offspring and captive of the earth being much
less than half the size of its larger companion it had
naturally cooled much more quickly and at a far earlier
period was capable of supporting life and life with
its incomprehensible purpose and apparently aimless
struggles immediately took possession of the diminu-
tive globe it developed and prospered reached its
maturity and then the moon began to die

  though evolution upon the satellite had not pro-
ceeded along the same lines as that upon the earth it
had produced as a climax an intelligence which was
in advance of that existing in man upon the terrestrial
sphere to-day the creatures representing the pinnacle
of lunarian intelligence were confined to a single
species and had been able for an enormous period of
time to support their life upon the moon by artificial
methods however thousands of years before the

actual occurrence the lunarian scientists had predicted
that the necessary chemicals mineral ores aud natural
gases used for the manufacture of the artificial foods
air water and other staples of life would disappear un-
der pressure of constant use it was apparent that the
only course left when such a condition arose would be
to leave the moon for another celestial body and natu-
rally as the earth was the nearest the migration would
turn in that direction for this purpose through thou-
sands of years the lunarian scientists had been work-
ing the progress coming closer aud closer to the
achievement throughout the centuries

  it thus developed that just before the extinction of
the dinosaurs upon earth the accrued knowledge of
thousands of years of lunarian toil was possessed by
one individual who had from this tremendous research
work evolved a machine which he believed could con-
vey him and his race to the safety of the terrestrial
planet this machine came none too soon however
for already the life on the higher mountains was fleeing
to the lowlands there was therefore no time for
the scientists to make trial flights in which to make cer-
tain of the ability of his machine to cross the fearful
limitless abyss or to ascertain whether or not his race
could exist upon the new world into whose characteris-
tics though so near the lunarians had been unable to
probe very deeply the inventor under these pressing
urgencies decided that he and a number of the most
brilliant scientific minds in his world would embark on
this greatest of all journeys as soon as conditions al-
lowed if it was successful he would return alone
and direct the completion of the thousands of inter-
planetary cars then under construction and the immense
migration would begin it was urgently necessary that
he should return for he alone understood the intricate
and complex machinery of the cars without him all
would be lost all other occupations had been long
sincc abandoned and the whole lunarian world waited
breathlessly for the hourly reports coming from all over
its surface to the great underground workshop where
the vehicle to convey the inventor and his colleagues
was receiving its last overhauling and testing their
purport was monotonously the same one after another
the gigantic air manufacturing plants ceased work for
lack of materials the heat-dispensing centers gave out
or the lighting systems were failing the lunarian
populace as a body were moving to the three great
workshops where the migration would start and here
rumor and panicky fear had run riot

  the testing and stocking of the inventors private
machine were soon completed and as they wcre just
entering the moons long night the inventor determined
that before the next daylight he would have left for
the earth it is perhaps well to explain here that the
lunarian night is now about twenty-nine earthly days in
length and was even at that early period but little
shorter

  the workshop in which the completed machine was
housed was situated at the end of a long narrow valley
between stark rugged mountains high beyond all com- 
prehension these terrific piles ranged miles into the
sky fantastic and abrupt in outline and formed a fitting
the death of the moon



background for this strangest of all ventures the
workshop which was underground was nevertheless
higher than the rest of the valley being on a portion
of the valley floor which had been volcanically raised
it was on the roof of this workshop that the machine
now stood a sharp-nosed winged cylinder it seemed
to be as it awaited the appearance of the tremendous
orb of the earth over the guarding mountains some
dread messenger of fate sombrely indifferent

underground all was seething bustle in the
workshop last minute tests were being taken har-
nesses were donned and strange apparatus were being
gone over minutely in the great underground cham-
bers beneath the main valley floor the mightiest con-
course ever gathered together awaited with tense
emotions the signal which would send them rushing
to the surface at last it came and in a trice the valley
was filled to overflowing all eyes concentrated upon
the dominant figure of the cylinder upon the platform
a death-like silence fell the mountains the lunarians
the car itself seemed waiting the appearance of those
great adventurers who dared the very depths of in-
finity then a trap-door beside the car opened and
the scientists filed out all immediately entering the
machine with the exception of the inventor who care-
fully went over its entire exterior finishing his in-
spection he turned and gazed out upon his fellows
who had come to see him off in this most monstrous of
all journeys in him lay their hope of life

  in one way only he resembled a human he stood
upright in every other way he had progressed along
different lines of development his body was curiously
like some of the lower terrestrial animals in that it
was segmented though the segmentation ceased at
a portion which could be called the thorax as the head
was immediately joined to this latter part he possessed
six limbs all of whose extremities were equipped with
elongations resembling digits but which were much
more flexible each so-called digit contained a number
of strong sucking organs the entire body was encased
in a hard horny substance which was jointed frequently
his head was in contrast covered with some growth
resembling fur which completely encircled the large
compound eyes and side closing horn-like jaws he
used only two limbs for walking

  dressed in thick cold-resisting clothes and carrying
a heavy helmet he presented a peculiar figure on all
sides were the tremendous mountains behind him was
the sullen machine while slowly creeping down the val-
ley floor over the heads of the lunarians showed the
baleful green light of the great earth orb

  what strange thoughts and feelings roamed through
the mind of this being who thought to wander at will
in the motionless boundless depths of eternal space as
he bade good-bye to his world did some prophetic
foreboding stir uneasily in the depths of his mind
silently he looked and silently his fellows returned his
look  then he turned and entered the cylinder the
great circular door clanged shut sounding weirdly hol-
low in that silent valley the powerful mechanism be-
neath the rocket-like car slowly in dead silence raised

it until its nose pointed into the far mysterious reaches
of the star-studded sky and all was ready for the most
momentous journey ever conceived

  all was tensely strainedly silent in the valley from
high above the earth-orb looked down coldly imper-
sonal flooding the valley and the jagged peaks in its
strange green light beyond it innumerable stars sar-
donically watched this attempt to avoid the inevitable
and upon the platform rested the planet car seemingly
waiting for some remote call to send it hurrying into the
darkness above for ages it seemed the portentous
silence held all motion lost then came a tremendous
earth-shaking roar and in a monstrous cloud of green-
ish vapor the sky car flashed away on its fearful plunge
into space in heavy silence the lunarians departed
from the valley and left it once more to the desolate
solitude

once more the warm golden sun shed his hazy
effulgence over the vast prehistoric american
plain the tall drowsy rushes bowed fitfully to the
unhurried breeze and billowy sun-reflecting clouds
sailed slowly along the horizon in the distance the
dancing heat waves performed queer antics against the
background of the familiar water-worn cliff and the
quiet lakes smiled dreamily as the breeze rumpled their
surfaces strange and heavily armored insects zoomed
and rumbled among the reed-beds and high above so
high as to be barely distinguishable against the faultless
blue of the sky-vault some distant progenitor of the
immense bird-life to be swung on motionless wings in
great continuous circles

  without any jarring effect on this somnolent peace
a deep resonant thrumming became gradually percept-
ible increasing in volume until a pointed winged cylin-
der from which the sound came appeared from behind
the cliff and sank gently into the rushes for some
time it lay there without sign of life but at last the
thick circular door opened and the lunarian inventor
stepped boldly into the earthly sunlight he gazed at
the strange landscape for a space and none may know
what thoughts and feelings passed through his mind
what ambitions were appeased or what long restrained
desires were in this hour fulfilled and satisfied he
had accomplished the impossible he had crossed the
greatest boundary life has yet encountered

  as he stood there in thought his companions began
to group themselves about him gazing with wonder and
delight at the luxuriant vegetation the darkly limpid
water-ways and the varied and plentiful life it now
only remained for the inventor to return across the bot-
tomless abyss direct the completion of the thousands
of sky-cars which he had before been unable to do and
the great migration could begin it was necessary
however to remain some days on the earth for the
machine had to be tested and gone over before attempt-
ing the return trip during this time they could explore
the immediate vicinity and gain some knowledge of the
earths condition and life they therefore spent that
day in a rigorous examination of the life about and
composition of the nearest of the lakes

  when the sound of the lunarian car had first become

noticeable tyranosaurus rex perhaps out of curiosity
had followed it through the jungle on the cliff to the
edge of the plain he had therefore been a witness to
the landing and primary exploration of the lunarians
for some reason he had not attacked them but after a
few hours he returned to the depths of the jungle
where he would have probably remained had it not
been for the moon-men led on by wonder after won-
der the latter had wandered farther and farther afield
and on the second day decided to explore part of the
jungle on the cliff before the inventor left as yet they
had seen none of the great dinosaurs and had no knowl-
edge of them

  the lunarians set out in a body and after laboriously
scaling the face of the cliff proceeded directly into the
dense tropical woodland this afforded them much of
interest and after aimlessly drifting from one object to
another for several hours they came upon a gulch
which had at one time been a water course and now led
down in a gradual slope to the plain here the geologi-
cal and mineralogical formations held their attention
and they were soon engrossed in the study of specimens
unknown to them this was the habitual path used by
tyranosaurus when going down to the plain the forces
of fate had gathered and were soon to strike

  tyranosaurus rex coming down the canyon with his
usual easy caution came suddenly upon the strange
creatures he had seen the day before he was undis-
covered so he stopped and watched them his unwink-
ing jet eyes and cruel hideously-armed mouth giving
no expression at all to his face he had come upon
them at an abrupt turn in the canyon and only his head
was visible the remainder of his body was hidden by
the moss-covered rock from here his great body held
tense and rigid he watched them with that crouching
utter motionless gaze which only reptiles can assume
the afternoon had almost gone the sun was approach-
ing the distant unbroken horizon and the long beams
of sunlight were feeling their way up the tree shaded
canyon which opened into the west when the lunarians
decided to start back to the car and then fate struck

a lunarian preparing to leave looked up from
a rock he had been studying and stared straight
into the grim glare of the gigantic saurian for per-
haps a minute he stared motionless one limb out-
stretched for an instrument and half bent over this
was the moment before the blow fell and the forest the
air the whole universe seemed held in breathless sus-
pense then with a peculiar chattering cry he sprang
upright seized a strangely formed apparatus from his
middle and worked the tentacles on the end of his limb
convulsively over it with a rasping hiss a dark red
stream which ceased almost as suddenly as it began
sprang from one end of the instrument and flickered
lightly over a portion of the saurians throat leaving
behind it a deep gash from which the blood flowed slug-
gishly at the sound of the cry the lunarians faced
about just in time to see tyranosaurus bleeding at the
throat and hissing terribly spring from behind the turn
in the canyon some distance away they saw with
horror the tremendous power expressed in every line of

the great beast and with one accord began retreating
slowly down the gorge this retreat changed imme-
diately into swift flight as tyranosaurus sprang in
pursuit

   it was hopeless from the start the monstrous leaps of
 the saurian far surpassed in speed anything they had
 thought could be possible to lesser living creatures they
 soon stopped running therefore and faced the charging
 giant their one thought being to save the life of the
 inventor at any cost to their own though the red
 streaks from the lunarian weapons seared his body con-
 stantly tyranosaurus rex did not once hesitate from
 his fearful charge down the canyon and unknowingly
 the fate of humanity to come hung upon his ability to
 reach and wipe out his enemies if he failed if he were
 killed and the lunarians escaped they would overrun
 the world and preclude forever the development of man
 on the earth but nothing could stop that irresistible
 charge suddenly he was among them striking and
 ripping with all four feet in the first second the
 heavy tail crushed the life from two and the death of
 the others soon followed until there remained only the
 inventor backed against the canyon wall tyranosaurus
 stood breathing heavily in the center eyeing him the
 saurian had not escaped unscathed from his attack
 blood ran from wounds all over his body and one fore-
 leg hung limp and useless at his side

   for only a second did he pause and then sprang full
 at the lunarian even as he left the ground a red
 stream played momentarily upon his body but could
 not stop him from his purpose he struck beside the
 inventor one huge foreleg delivered a fearful blow
 and the lunarian lay stretched upon the rock floor of
 the ancient water course

   a flashing movement a second of time and the work
 of uncountable centuries of unnumbered millions of
 years was gone for naught as though it had never been
 why had life originated upon the moon why had it
 struggled up from simplicity to complexity from ignor-
 ance to brilliant knowledge if it were only to be de-
 stroyed in the end by a giant inhabitant of the earth
 such is life always seemingly without purpose aimless
 incomprehensible and playing a game it cannot hope to
 win extinction is the only end for any species thus
 went the great amphibians on earth giving place to the
 dinosaurs who also after millions of years develop-
 ment disappeared and were replaced by the mammals

   as tyranosaurus gave the death stroke he swayed
 and a second after the lunarian fell his slayer sank be-
 side him a few lunarians stirred and twitched but
 finally except for the sobbing breath of the dying dino-
 saur all was still tyranosaurus lay as did the still-
 living inventor facing the west and both could look out
 over the unbroken plains to the western sky the great
 tawny sun was just sinking behind the wavering grass-
 lands and its level rays reached far across the plains
 floor and up the canyon bathing all in a solemn ethereal
 glow high above them in the broken canopy of multi-
 colored trees and giant ferns an easy roaming wind
 sighed and rustled now and then exposing a patch of
 blue sky from far away across the still bosoms of
 the dreaming lakes drifted a weird throbbing cry
the death of the moon



a cry as sorrowful as mysterious as age-old life itself

  the sinking sun bathed the saurians grim visage in a
soft warm light and as he gazed into the last sunset he
would ever see across far spaces into the mellow glory
of the life-giver tyranosaurus eyes softened and he
was vested with a dim far-away dignity as one whose
purpose is accomplished gradually the harsh sobbing
diminished and finally ceased and tyranosaurus rex
king of the giant lizards most terrible of all carni-

vores and most feared had gone forever from earth

  the sun was gone far along the west stretched a
streak of amber light all else the night had claimed
high above the canyon showing through a space in the
leaves sailed the round full moon throwing her pure
white light like a protecting mantle over the broken
pathetic body of her perished son the inventor while
deep below her surface she hid a race awaiting his
triumphal return long would they wait-long

the world of the
giant ants

by a hyatt verrill

otories about ants are no longer a novelty in fiction
oscientifiction stories about ants have been written
before

  but zee unhesitatingly state that this new story by
the well-knozvn writer is no doubt the greatest ant story
that has ever been conceived

  the editor of this magazine in a talk with mr verrill
who is not only an author of note but a noted explorer as
zvell asked him to do a special ant story for this magazine
it is interesting to note that practically the entire story
was written in the south american jungle during mr
verrilvs latest expedition

  readers will remember that mr verrill discovered a
new race of bearded indians near the peruvian wilds in
south america outside of this mr verrill has for many
years been making a deep study of ants and their habits
and the things that he tells its of them in this story are
not at all exaggerated if you magnify the usual ant you
will have exactly what mr verrill gives vs in this notable
document

  we wish to impress upon the reader the important fact
that the habits of the ants as described in this story are
scientifically accurate in practically all respects

  fezv people are interested enough to study a dry scien-
tific work of ant-life but here we are given the greatest
scientifiction story of ants and the way they live made
particularly interesting because it is in fiction form

  in order to enhance the value of the story the editor
has taken the liberty to bring in a number of illustrations
taken from well-knozvn scientific zvorks

  ivc live in a machine age only efficiency and accom-
plishment is of any importance in our present scheme of
life everything zvorks along the stencil line nowadays
we wear the same clothes of -which several thousand are
cut with the same die we wear the same sort of shoes all
made by the same machines and all alike including the
polish we eat the same sort of food coming out of the
same cans by the million zve read the same kind of litera-
ture printed by the thousand and the hundred-thousand

  the stamp of the machine is upon our bodies anti upon
our minds we all act alike and come pretty near think-
ing alike i seems to be quite the thing for all of us to
be as exactly alike as we possibly can be if zve vary this
formula ever so little zve become conspicuous at once
which is not always to our liking

  and uhen it comes to the great industrial interests the
big employers naturally expect to have efficiency which
apparently they can only get by having their workers all
perform along certain mechanical lines all must work
alike in certain endeavors and all must perform alike if
results arc to be had

    by that time however a significant pre-
cedent will have been established and a lesson learnt
that will not easily be forgotten the superfluous-
ness of men above a certain essential minimum will
have become recognized officially and unofficially
as a social fact the legislature will establish laws
to guarantee that this minimum should not be sur-

passed and in a very short while it will beecme a
mere matter of routine to proceed to an annual
slaughter of males who have either outlived their
prime or else have failed to fulfill the promise of
their youth in meekness general emasculatcness
and stupidity

-anthony m ludovicis lysistrala

- sat in his glass demonstration cage and
hated he hated the endless sultry after-
noon he hated the dusty museum in
which he had spent all his life he hated
the limp trees of the park which stretched
in all directions their fronds sagging and listless in the
midsummer heat half obscuring half revealing the
gigantic structures of the metropolis in which they
panted for breath

  but most of all he hated himself why could he
not have been born a woman he stared enviously
at the crowd of narrowflanked flat-breasted workers
who stood outside the cage and gazed at him with
dull curiosity on their soulless faces women at least
had a purpose in life he ruminated they could
work straining their muscles and minds eternally at
tasks that exhausted them so that at night they sank
into a stupor of forgetfulness which was only broken
when the work gong sounded again

  while he the last man had nothing to do but appear
in his cage on rest days to appease the workers curi-
osity as to what a man had
been during the dark ages
when the human race was
bi-sexual otherwise his
time was his own

  nobody molested him un-
less he attempted to leave
the museum unattended his
keepers brought the best
food obtainable saw that
his wants were attended to
and allowed him to browse
knlg months away in the
files of the museum library
where the dust of ages was piled inches thick over the
imperishable metal-foil volumes

  even curiosity that one trait which had dragged
mankind through the mire of prehistoric times into
the trees across the seas and at last to a magnificence
which had almost allowed him to touch the stars
was dying it was only the fact that the last man
might be seen there that dragged the plodding toil-
ers through the little park on rest days otherwise
they strictly avoided the place spending their time
sleeping or staring blankly in front of them like

wearied cattle it was useless to think of new things

  the museum was a mystery even to m-l built
ages ago before the race had started its long decay
into automatism it towered story on story above
the ground level and burrowed additional stories be-
neath the earth vast stretches of it he had never ex-
plored in other wings the lights had long ago expired
and he was forced to creep through tottering skeletons
of prehistoric animals among the ruins of towering
bookstacks searching here there everywhere in an ef-
fort to find the meaning of all this

the bloated sun sank with infinite slowness behind
a gigantic glittering structure which occupied one
whole side of the park the crowd of curious drifted
away with equal slowness the rest day was over
to-morrow the human hive would drone again with
unceasing breath-taking activity striving ever striving
to produce enough food to supply the myriads of be-
ings which inhabited nil yok

  why he wondered was not the population cut  with
reproduction reduced to a
mere matter of chemistry
that should be an easy mat-
ter then he realized that
if the population were re-
duced factories would be
idle wheels would cease to
turn he nodded to himself
as he gathered up the few
books with which he had
been killing time during the
day that would be against
the economy of the hive no
one must be idle-no one
must cease from unremitting toil-except himself he
ruminated on these strange things as he slowly retraced
his steps toward the little room where he ate and slept

  perhaps it would be well to describe this museum
freak as he loiters down a long crumbling corridor in
the half-darkness broken here and there bv spots of
semi-incandeseent glow he is tall well-formed hardly
distinguishable from the man of the twenty-fifth or
thirtieth century except that his cranial development is
somewhat more marked he appears to be in mature
youth he is perhaps sixty or seventy years of age he

   a ccordng to kipling the female of the species
 si is always more deadly by that he means that she
 is stronger in her own way and we know that she usually
 is more numerous even among human beings there are
 more females than males perhaps in thousands of years
 evolution will have progressed in such a manner that the
 world will he entirely peopled by females this is not so
 impossible as it would seem to be because with many insects
 the female of the species already predominates

   the present story then is founded upon an excellent
 scientific basis and the story itself is as excellent as it is
 original and unusual yon will not forget it for a long time

is slim and taut of body like one who has taken care of
himself physically but he has a slight stoop which indi-
cates that he has spent much of his life poring over
books his form is trim and masculine with flat hips
and broad shoulders and lacks that sexless smoothness
which was so noticeable in his watchers of the after-
noon

  in fact he is a throwback an unexplainable atavar
which the physicians have decided to preserve for a
while as a warning and a curiosity

  he lounged listlessly in his room where a gaunt
sour-faced woman-if you could call a creature a
woman who was as sexless as a worker bee-was stir-
ring a mess in a bubbling kettle

  what he grumbled carbohydrate  again
why dont the food laboratories vary their formula
once in a while they used to when i was a young-
ling

  costs labor costs labor she snapped back the
sources of supply are getting scarcer too besides its
not for the likes of such as you to be complaining

  but why not discover new courses of supply he
puzzled

  she straightened from her stirring and surveyed him
with loathing and undisguised hatred  tis a good
thing you are the last man she stormed such crazy
ideas new sources of supply when you well know
the last source of supply was discovered two hundred
thousand years ago shame to suggest such blas-
phemy  atavist

  with that last shot which made him wince she left
him to his food

  he attacked the chemically manufactured soap with
something like gusto he knew it contained all the
vitamines proteins and other ingredients combined into
just the right form to sustain life at the lowest pos-
sible cost

  he ate in the shortest possible time then relaxed
and surfeited he dropped into a reverie which as al-
ways revolved around his uselessness in this feminine
world from his reading of forgotten books he un-
derstood pretty well the conditions which had brought
about the mono-sexual world in which he lived the
enormous release of feminine energy in the twentieth
to thirtieth centuries due to the increased life span
and the fact that the world had been populated to such
an extent that women  longer were required to spend
most of their time bearing children had resulted in
more and more usurpation by women of what had been
considered purely masculine endeavors and the proper
occupations of the male sex

   gradually and without organized resistance from the
stronger sex women with their unused super-abun-
dant energy had taken over the work of the world
gradually complacent lazy and decadent man had con-
fined his activities to war and sports thinking these the
only worth-while things in life

   then almost over night it seemed although in reality
it had taken long ages war became an impossibility
due to the unity of the nations of the earth and sports
were entered into and conquered by the ever-invading
females

after that the rest of the pitiful story was simple
the useless ornamental males began to be treated
in much the same fashion in which the worker bees treat
the drones having lost the mastery of the world the
men found themselves helpless and in the way slowly
but steadily they were exterminated by the ambitious
females

  there had been fighting of course m-l recalled
with a thrill the tales of those last battles it was dur-
ing the great famine just before chemists had dis-
covered how to manufacture food out of inorganic
matter

   then suddenly to quote a book of that period a
few of the leading women perceived with apocalyptic
clarity not only that the superfluity of men had be-
come a burden on the community and a menace to the
food of the children but also that the reduction of their
number to the barest minimum indispensable for the
purposes of fertilization would be a two-fold boon-it
would relieve the food crisis both for the moment and
possibly also for the future and obviate forever the
danger of a masculine or slave rising

  a sex-fight at the distributing station of a large
store sufficed to light the first spark of this new con-
flagration a dead set was made against the men not
only around the original focus of the trouble but
everywhere the legislature recognizing their oppor-
tunity supported the popular fury and proceeded to a
systematic slaughter of males until with the help of
the regular troops it was found practicable to protect
and preserve a small nucleus for next years fertiliza-
tion

  oddly enough m-l admired the neatness and dispatch
with which his kind had been wiped out what use
were they

  finally some last genius of that glorious age had
discovered the method of reproducing human life by
chemical formula and the men were dispensed with
altogether only a few museum specimens were re-
tained to warn the world of the horror from which it
had escaped

  in the ages which followed great physiological
changes took place women no longer having need of
sex dropped it like a worn-out cloak and became sex-
less tall angular narrow-hipped flat-breasted and un-
beautiful

  but the world was perfect now m-l realized no
further change was necessary he grew ashamed of
his suggestion that new discoveries might be made
everything was known life was complete vibrant
the millenium was at hand and he was the only dis-
cordant factor	

  but somehow he was dissatisfied nervous excited
catching up a warm robe-for the long nights caused
by the gradual slowing down of the earths rotation
during the ages were as icy as the days were sultry-
he wrapped it about him and started pacing the cor-
ridor again toward the observation cage something at
variance with his environment stirred within him he
knew not what some urge of the summer which he
could not drive away the world was perfect yet he
felt a note of misery which sickened him
the last man



  he remembered the dull work-besotted faces of those
for whom he posed once every ten days there was not
the joy among them that should be expected in a per-
fect world-the joy that the old old books of poetry
and love which he had deciphered indicated the world
to be full of what was wrong

  his steps muffled by the thick dust he stumbled
along finally emerging into the glass cage where he
had spent the day to stand staring hopelessly at the
stars for the first time he had a feeling that things
were not well that life had become shamefully muddled
somehow

   shaking himself out of his lethargy he glanced about
him-at the city which glittered not far off its lights
flashing like the signals of fairyland-at the dreaming
trees now revived from the universal weariness-at the
half moon just peeping over the horizon

  suddenly he felt that he was not alone glancing
sharply over his shoulder he fancied that he saw a
dark shape take form among the trees

  then winging its way through the impenetrable
glass of the cage came a voice clear and musical un-
like the dead accents which he had become accustomed
to from his keepers and from occasional curious celeb-
rities

  in his astonishment he forgot the purport of the
words-if they were words-for the message seemed to
ring inside his head rather than in his ears like a
flash he realized that the person outside was using
telepathy that mythical art supposedly lost since almost
the dawn of history

  who are you like a knife thrust the query
flashed into his consciousness through the soundproof
glass

   as in a dreani he felt the segments of his brain click
into a long-forgotten connection to reply in kind m-l
the last man

  the figure outside approached the cage and in the
dim moonlight he stared in wonder hair red as a
slumberous fire-eyes blue as the heavens-a face fair
as the dream faces which sometimes tortured him

   unconsciously true to his training he recoiled an
atavist he gasped a throwback how did you
escape 

  she laughed and though he could not hear the fairy
sound he saw the back thrown head the rounded throat
the laughing eyes the keepers are so dumb she
answered it is so easy to be free why dont you
join me

   he shivered as at a sacrilege

  dont talk so he protested it would mean your
death if the keepers heard it is wicked

  again she laughed and this time tossed one milk-
white arm against the moon nothing is wicked
came the message and their dead minds are too dull
to understand come out and dance in the moonlight
with me

  for a splendid instant he had the impulse to seize a
chair and smash his prison of glass but lifelong in-
hibitions were too strong a wave of horror and loath-
ing seized him go away demon he gasped you
are a rebel i shall warn the guard

   unafraid she wrinkled her nose at him then wrap-
ping about her a long black robe which but half con-
cealed her deep breasts and the forgotten womanly
grace of her carriage she whispered another time
and vanished among the shadows of the park

frightened horrified yet fascinated as though
by a devil he stood staring after her for a long mo-
ment before he fled back down the protecting corridor
to his room as if he were pursued by a ghost

   for long hours he sat at jiis desk staring into the
shadows which the light did not dispel well he knew
that it was his duty to report an atavist at large well
he knew the havoc they had wrought in the past by
waking uprisings against the established order by fan-
ning dying sparks of revolt into short-lived conflagra-
tions with their talk of beauty and love-and liberty
but that was long ago while there were still men al-
though a dwindling minority

  now he was the last man the call was to him a
witch like those in the old old stories was lying in
wait for him

  he fell into a fitful slumber but was beset by
dreams-strange-mad dreams of beauty and soft arms
and flashing limbs which brought him to his feet in a
sweat of agony a dozen times during the night

  old wa  na  whom in defiance of the rules
he always called wana found him dishevelled and fev-
erish when she brought the morning meal

   whats the trouble  she queried anxiously for the
position of warden to the last man had its responsibil-
ities are you ill  shall i call a physician 

   no he snapped i need a change wana thats
all lets drive to the seashore for a day this place
chokes me

  all right she grumbled though what good you
get out of sitting and staring at the waves i cant un-
derstand nobody else does it but youre a freak
and in spite of her surliness a wisp of pathos crept
into the last words and her face which looked as if the
soul had been eroded from it long ago assumed a
haunted expression

  a car was brought round and they clambered in--
wana dressed in nothing at all for with the passing
of sex the need for clothing had ceased to exist and
the man swathed in a long black robe such as those
used to cover the infirmities of the aged

   through the wide straight boulevards flanked on
either side by glistening skyscrapers of surpassing
beauty they drove at breathless speed everything was
clean with a dazzling agonizing cleanness which made
the senses reel he longed before ihey had driven
half an hour for the forgotten dust and gloom of the
museum

   there there was no traffic jam no noise no hurry-
but only a dogged persistent energy that was capable
of moving mountains but knew not where to move
them through the sides of the plate glass edifices of
the metropolis he caught glimpses of myriads of
workers toiling frantically in perfectly hygienic sur-
roundings soaked in the health-giving ultra-violet rays
of the sun which the crystal walls admitted in their

full power he found himself panting for breath like
a runner in a nightmare and cursed his stupidity in
allowing himself always to be thus affected when he
was taken through the manufacturing district

  at last they passed between two thousand foot high
structures and emerged abruptly into the open country
there were no suburbs no encircling truck farms the
city ended witli the abruptness of a thunderclap and
towered behind them like a heap of diamonds

  wana pushed forward a silver handle a rocket
motor in the rear outhe car began coughing gently
the machine rose into the air and shot at tremendous
speed over the deserted countryside then under the
skilful guidance of the driver it settled to the ground
on a sunny tree-covered knoll near the seashore

  on all sides stretched unutterable desolation for the
race long ago had abandoned the unprofitable tilling of
the soil and now resorted solely to the converting of
inorganic into organic matter for food the country-
side round about was as wild and abandoned as in the
forgotten days when sir walter raleigh first stepped
ashore there

  never straying from under the watchful eye of his
keeper m-l strolled about the beach or swam in the
warm waters of the atlantic he had tossed aside his
disguising robe now that there were no spectators and
relieved from the tension of the city romped in the
warm sunshine like a child

  at noon he swallowed some food pills and tired by
his mornings exercise went to sleep under a massive
oak tree

he awakened by a sibilant hissing close beside him
looking up he beheld the girl he had met in the
moonlight the night before

  shh  she cautioned your nurse is asleep

  how did you get here he gasped

  vacation she giggled my guards are searching
for me in the woods

  you followed us he accused

she nodded and her face assumed a faint pink tinge
which puzzled him yet set his pulses throbbing i
heard you talking about your vacation so i became
conveniently ill and suggested a trip to the same place
heard me he puzzled

  well yes or thought you-or-something tele-
pathy you know

  why are you was his next question as he stared
at her supple grace i mean why are you alive
oh a sub-normal development like yourself she
replied and oddly enough there was no shame in her
voice rather he decided she gloried in the fact that
she was a hundred thousand years behind her age

  you see they thought i was normal while i was a
child she added then when i went queer-you
know their horror of killing things

  do you work he asked remembering the universal
law

  oh sometimes she nodded as she seated herself
beside him you know they she spoke almost he re-
alized as if she were mentioning some lower order of
animals have lost their sense of color values to a

large extent and they find me very valuable in the
food factories where the color of the slides has a great
deal to do with the ionization

  why she asked suddenly turning toward him
do you stay in that musty museum

  why he answered her do you stay in the food
factory- because you cant escape

  cant i  she mocked

  yes you could run away he admitted but then
what away from the food distributing stations youd
starve to death in two weeks what would you eat  he
demanded his exasperation rising at her superior smile
bugs grass animals the horror of this last sug-
gestion almost choked him

  why yes she admitted serenely and to his con-
sternation began stripping a bush of its fruit and put-
ting the dark red berries into her mouth

  stop he cried grasping her arm that stuff
will kill you you must know that the human stomach
has atrophied from eating concentrated food for thou-
sands of years

  mine hasnt ive tried these berries before yours
hasnt you forget that we were born out of our time
of course these-these animated fossils-would die
she admitted turning up her nose at the reclining fig-
ure of wana but not us try these she dropped
a cluster of the ripe fruit into his hands

  hesitantly he complied his mouth unused to any-
thing but pills and liquids puckered strangely but
fired by her example he persisted long idle salivary
glands came slowly into action his jaws unaccustomed
to munching began to ache but a satisfying feeling
of warmth and well-being pervaded him taste that
long-lost fifth sense returned

  music he muttered its like music inside of
one he reached for another bunch of the fruit

  easy she laughed dancing nimbly out of reach
dont forget that this is your first trial youll
probably be sick as it is

  their voices unconsciously had risen during this ex-
change and wana stirred in her sleep

  shh whispered his companion ill see you next
restday night goodbye like a shadow she fled
through the trees before his keeper could rub her an-
cient eyes and sit up

  what have you been doing-letting me sleep like
this she scolded jumping to her feet for wana was
very active in spite of the fact that she had about
reached the limit of usefulness and would be shuf-
fling off this mortal coil in the lethal chambers not
many years hence come its time to go she said
throwing his funereal robe about his shoulders the
sun is setting climb into the car

  escape  he idea not entirely new interested him
as they rushed homeward through the evening sky
was it possible to live as the birds and animals did
he was fascinated

  then as if in answer to his query an awful stom-
ach-ache gripped him as his digestive track unused to
solid nourishment rebelled against the berries he
writhed in agony and knew the horror of approaching
dissolution luckily wana was in the control cabin
the last man



and saw nothing of what transpired between the two

  but he did not die the pains subsided leaving
him limp and covered with cold sweat was liberty
worth such a price he wondered

during the next ten days he prowled in unac-
customed corners of the museum library and as
chance would have it came upon a book entitled
natural food a warning of its perils written at
a time when concentrated nourishment had been in uni-
versal use but a short time this volume warned back-
sliders into gourmandism of the awful penalty which
would ensue if vegetable or animal food was con-
sumed unconsciously it dropped hints now and then
however of the manner of preparing those odious
viands he read and remembered

  the next restday dawned and brought its usual crowd
of worn toilers to stare into his crystal cage but he
no longer envied them he no longer hated himself in
fact he was not thinking of such things he was think-
ing only of the night that was coming

  forgotten was his horror of the witch girl sub-
consciously his mind had made common cause with hers
they were one fighting an alien world

  darkness came at last after consuming his nourish-
ment he avoided wana crept into the park garbed
in his black robe and waited almost at once a soft
strong hand slipped into his

  the spell works said the well-known laughing
voice the witch has you charmed did i not tell
you escape was easy

  they stopped and looked at each other under the
moon which had just passed the zenith a great wave
of tenderness and admiration swept over him awk-
wardly he seized both her hands in his

  youre so different he marveled you make me
feel queer here he tapped his chest like tears
be stumbled and sunshine and flowers

  she smiled and leaning forward gently touched her
lips to his a shock like that from a dynamo passed
through him he leaped back as though she had struck
him then reapproached

  what was that  he asked stupidly

  a kiss she answered

  through the long avenue of elm trees just the same
as those which lined parks when the world was young
they wandered into the flood-lighted streets

  they attracted little attention as they loitered along
a few persons crossed their hands on their chests as
they passed in a sign of respect with their cowls
closely drawn and their slow pace m-l and his com-
panion were easily mistaken for the ancients or law
givers and so passed unquestioned

  for although it was a universal rule that persons
should enter the lethal gas chambers as soon as they
bad passed the limit of usefulness-that is when they
could no longer do their twelve hours of labor daily-
exceptions were made in the case of legislators and
captains of working units who were presumed to re-
tain their intellectual faculties after their physical pow-
ers had declined

  these lucky ones lived until they died natural deaths

but they went clothed in long black robes to avoid
awakening envy in those who were doomed to die much
younger

what is your number m-l asked suddenly as
they entered a long roofed thoroughfare lined on both
sides with great warehouses and humming factories

my name is eve she replied smiling i gave
it to myself i have forgotten my number

 a half-memory of some old myth stirred him the
 first woman he mused and i am the last man
 strange

 he felt her mocking eyes upon him i shall call
 you adam she said softly

 but that would be wrong he objected adam was
 the first man wasnt he

 she merely laughed at him

 they turned into the portal of a vast structure which
 stretched for thousands of feet along the street

where do we go he queried

 this is unit  of the food factory she ex-
 plained i work here have you ever seen the inside
 of the hive

 only in pictures he replied i never was allowed
 to enter the factories

 they wandered down a long corridor doors in which
 opened into what seemed endless rooms humming with
 monstrous machinery here and there however a
 room stood idle its machines covered with dust

those engines are broken she explained the
mechanics have forgotten how to fix them

 they went on through labyrinthian tunnels under
 overhead bridges and on dizzy galleries that looked
 down on unremitting industry

 decay she said suddenly look at it all about
 you in spite of their breathless efforts see she
 pointed to a great mill its screens broken and torn its
 cogs rusted from centuries of disuse the world is
 dying soon-in a few thousand years perhaps when
 this almost perfect machinery crumbles yet more-it
 will be dead

 and you and i will be dead too he said bitterly

 and the world will be given over to the animals
 and the birds and the insects oh the pity of it a
 living tomb

 but i thought the world had attained perfection
 he puzzled that all the great secrets of life had been
 attained  that life purred gently like a perfect ma-
 chine

 so they say she replied to hide the horror of
 the thing but the machine is not eternal and they
 have forgotten so much so much 

passing into the street once more they stepped on
one of the rapidly moving surface platforms which
long ago had supplanted the clumsy street cars and
elevateds and sped at breakneck pace through the
heart of the city

 where to now he asked

 to the birth factory she answered nonchalantly

 he gasped and something of his old fear of her re-
 turned

but you dare not he cried clutching her arm


amazing stories

remember the law reads no atavist on pain of death
shall enter the precincts of the birth factory 

  she laughed gayly we shall not be discovered
remember they have forgotten so much-you have
seen pictures of the place

  he nodded

 remember the dome

  yes

  well there is a little gallery half way up it looks
like a mere frieze from the floor they have forgotten
it i found the secret in an old book we shall not
be discovered

  they stopped in front of a magnificent building not
of glass but of marble it was without adornment and
beautiful as a naked sword blade unlike the other
buildings of the city it was detached from the crystal
roof that capped all the streets and stood alone in a
little park

  before its portals paced a strong guard heavily
armed strangely enough with weapons closely resem-
bling those used in the last wars rifles and automatic
revolvers were the only mobile killing machines known
for progress in that direction as in all others had
stopped long ago

  come eve directed

  they skirted the building under the watchful eye of
the guard and entered a warehouse half a block away
through a long series of storerooms which were de-
serted at that late hour she led him finally to stop in
front of a blank wall drawing a pitch pipe from her
robe she blew three soft notes

  what do you want said a hollow mechanical
voice above their heads adam for we shall call him
thus hereafter cowered in terror at this new develop-
ment but the girl replied slo-wly and distinctly

     

  slowly ponderously a panel in the wall swung back
they stepped into a tiny hall the door closed behind
them

  a clever safe combination she smiled i hope it
doesnt wear out while were in here it hasnt been
cared for in ages wonderful artificers these ancients
must have been

  they climbed endless narrow stairs after passing
through what must have been a subterranean gallery
connecting the warehouse with the birth factory and
at last emerged upon the tiny balcony she had spoken
of they looked down far below in the middle of
a vast hall pulsed six amber globes of light arranged
about a great globe of crystal

  the central globe he knew was filled with germ
plasm from which reservoir the human race was per-
petuated from it flowed the eternal stream of life
which turned the wheels and manned the factories the
world over

  the system in its essentials had been discovered in
the twentieth century when a surgeon had placed a
bit of tissue from the heart of a chicken in a sterile
medium fed it carefully and kept it in an ideal en-
vironment he and his successors had watched that
tissue live for a hundred years it was growing so
rapidly that it had to be watched carefully and trimmed

continually to keep it within the limits of the container

  as the growing scarcity and uselessness of the males
and the antagonism of the free women to becoming
mothers had grown in the old days the legislators hit
upon a similar scheme for perpetuating the race by
chemical means it might have been called the last
creative work of the human mind

  a small quantity of germ serum was enclosed in the
gigantic crystal globe under proper conditions given
the right type of food and allowed to grow which it
did at a tremendous rate then it was fertilized by
the same methods which the ancient french physicians
alexis carrel ebleing and fische had used to produce
fatherless frogs

  this fertilized ovum cultivated in embryonic tissue
juice then was allowed to grow in a type of incubator
until it developed skin bones and muscles and was
ready to be taken to the nursery a normal infant

two things the ancients had not calculated upon
however first they forgot that the eternally
growing germ plasm could not continue the develop-
ment of the race every child produced in this man-
ner was on the same intellectual spiritual and physical
level with every other child with the development of
artificial birth the long increase in human brain capacity-
had stopped short in fact a slow decay had set in as
the serum lost its original virility through the ages

  the second mistake was in creating one gigantic birth
factory instead of a number of branches this resulted
in terrific congestion as millions of children yearly had
to be started in their growth and then shipped to dis-
tant lands where their adolescence was to be spent
in the old days there always had been danger of an up-
rising among the males to smash the plant but this
had long since passed and the guard about the portal
was merely a formality

  adam was interrupted in his revery by the voice of
his companion

  you understand of course why atavists are forbid-
den here

  he nodded because in the dark ages they always
tried to destroy the life factory

  but now it is too late for that he continued
soberly children no longer can be produced natu-
rally even if any one so desired then forgetting
his oft-repeated assertion that the world was perfect
the utter blankness into which the race was drifting
swept down upon him like a bank of fog and be added
bitterly

  we are doomed i see it all so clearly now there
can be no more progress there can be no more super-
men to drag mankind forward in spite of its blindness

  no eve whispered but there are atavists to drag
mankind backward to a point where it can get a fresh
start

  the idea dazzled him you mean-we-we could
have children-and build a new clean race

  she looked down blushing

  still trying to grasp the immensity of her sugges-
tion he turned back to the scene below but he
muttered we would have to stop all this-stop all
the last man



this or they would crush us by the sheer weight of
numbers he stared at the softly glowing container
below with a new and bitter loathing instead of the
cradle of mankind it suddenly had become a races
prison house

  unwittingly he had leaned farther and farther over
the railing of the balcony now without warning its
ancient moorings parted and a large section of the
balustrade tottered slowly outward and fell

  he heard a shriek behind him felt his robe caught
as he reeled on the edge and was jerked backward to the
safety of the balcony unable to tear his gaze from
the falling railing he stared aghast would it strike
the precious globe and shatter it would it would
it but the mass of twisted metal fell to one side
crushing one of the many guards below into a horrid
pulp of blood and brains

  for a moment there was stunned silence in the hall
then a babble of shrill voices arose and a battery of
spectacled eyes turned toward the two who clung to
their perch on the balcony

  atavists atavists man the doors open fire
guard the crystal shouted a captain of the guards
waving her arms in strangely ant-like gestures adam
found time to marvel at the ineffectiveness of it all
at the foreshorfened figures scurrying about below at
their feeble shouts at his impotence

  an explosive rifle bullet which tore a hole as big
as a barrel in the wall beside him brought him to his
senses but unmindful of his danger he crouched at
the edge of the floor and stared

  bedlam had broken loose as guards strove to draw
an armor plate cover over the precious globe of life
serum shouts shrieks prayers mingled to make a
sound strangely like that of pigs squealing for it
must be understood that the people worshipped the
crystal as their only god it was the giver of life
long ago they had discarded all idea of personal im-
mortality but the dream of immortality for the race
through the germ plasm still persisted and the human
bees sprang into battle formation as ready to sting to
death anything any person that attacked their life
stream as a real swarm of bees is to fight for its queen

  adam was shaken out of dazed horror by his compan-
ion quick she screamed all her gaiety vanished-
her fair face drawn into a mask of fear the stairs
it is the only way they will throw a guard about the
district but perhaps we can squeeze through hurry
for gods sake

  down those endless stairs they ran-fell-rolled-
their robes first in shreds then lost bleeding and
bruised they reached the panel

  eve blew three shaky notes on the pitch pipe which
she had held clutched in her hand what do you
want grumbled the mechanism

  - - she gasped between breaths

  the panel remained immovable

  clenching her fists until the blood started where the
nails cut into the palms eve strove to regain her breath
while the precious moments passed

  finally she tried again-three short notes

  what do you want queried the sullen impersonal

voice within which seemed to lurk a note of mockery

   this time she repeated the combination with a voice
 clear and serene

   slowly the panel turned

   down the dimly lighted warehouse alleys they fled
 back of them a voice raised the view halloo the game
 seemed ended the worlds last chance gone

   somehow nevertheless they kept ahead of their pur-
 suers winding twisting dodging through piles of
 machinery bales of goods past unknown bruising lurk-
  ing inanimate objects which seemed designed to beat
 out their brains they finally saw a flood-lighted street
 ahead

   a bolt of dark cloth caught his eye as they raced
 for the entrance here he gasped tearing off two
 lengths wrap this around you as a cloak well
 make it yet the alarm has not spread this way they
 have forgotten to inform the radio controls

   you go ahead she panted im done for my
cell house is back the other way ill never get in un-
noticed now

   come with me he directed propelling her toward
 the deserted speeding platforms they never can
 find you in the museum probably theyll never think
 to look and if they do i know every nook and hiding-
 place hurry dont forget our purpose  -

   the platform swept them away but not before they
 could hear the cell houses bursting into frenzy behind
 them as the workers learned of the attack and poured
 forth to the chase

   still for some strange reason the radio alarms were
 silent no one impeded them as the almost deserted
 ways swept along

   at the park they leaped to the ground and fled
 through the dark trees wasting no time he dragged
 her through the museum entrance hid her behind a
 mass of bones that once might have been the skeleton
 of a mastodon and divesting himself of his robe
 threw himself on his couch and lay as though asleep

   and not a moment too soon the alarms were work-
 ing at last loud raucous and shrill they blared
 throughout the city the news of the outrage check
 all atavists came the message kill instantly those
 who are not in their cells kill kill the humani-
 tarian laws are in abeyance spare no suspicious ata-
 vist our race must be preserved

   shaking with fright and apprehension old wana
 who had pledged her life to keep watch over m-l but
 who could not resist taking a nap now and then peered
 into his shadowy cell

   he lay at ease breathing deeply-evenly with a
 sigh of relief she closed the curtains a minute later
 he heard her reporting to the chief that her charge
 was in his bed

 the next weeks were full of formless terror yet
 lighted by the growing loe between the last man
 and the woman he now had chosen as his mate during
 the long dusty days when they prowled the shadowv
 alcoves together their love blossomed like a flower

   endlessly they planned escape but in their hearts
 they felt it was useless endlessly he toiled through


amazing stories

 brittle volumes seeking some method of destroying the
 hateful life factory but although there were hints of
 forgotten explosives the formulae were meaningless to
 bin besides he had not the materials to manufacture
 even black powder

  adam shared his food rations with eve without
exciting the suspicions of wana but he and the girl
grew wan and weak from lack of sufficient nourish-
ment she still hid in the dark recesses of the build-
ing where he would find her waiting for him with the
same gay smile on her pinched face every morning
after wana had made inspection

  hand in hand they would wander for hours in the
dreary ruin stopping to wonder at some monstrous
skeleton shouting with delight when they found a
beautiful trinket or ancient scarab among the debris of
an exhibit

  or their arms about each other they would sit in
some far-away sunny corner and dream great impos-
sible dreams of the world they would create when they
escaped

  somewhere he had run across a scrap from a forgot-
ten poet which kept running through his head as though
in mockery

    ah love could you and i with fate conspire
    to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire
    would not we shatter it to bits-and then
    re-mould it nearer to our hearts desire

  he quoted it to eve one day and comforted her
when she burst into tears

  then when all seemed lost when the shrinking of
undernourished tissues made them nervous and ir-
ritable  when it seemed they no longer could hold out
he found the secret

  in an unexplored subterranean gallery where cob-
webs hung in yard-long streamers where bats flitted
squeaking from rafter to rafter and where the only
light was furnished by a flashlight he carried they came
upon rows and rows of hermetically sealed jars with
unfamiliar inscriptions

  rubbing the dust from several of the labels he puz-
zled over them

  suddenly eve clapped her hands in delight its
ancient english script she cried excitedly see
the kind that was used before the phonetic alphabet
was brought into use lets see-i know a little about
th century writing-

   samples of high ex-plos-ives used in the world
war  she spelled out laboriously  in this group
are some of the dead-li-est chemi-cals ever dis-covered
by man the m-a-t-e-r-i-a- con-tained in the cen-tral
can-i-ster is tnt trinitrotoluene do not
touch 

  their lips trembling they stared at each other over
the feeble lamp tnt he breathed ive heard
of it

  slowly she continued her translation  enough
tnt is contained in this canister to sink a b-a-t-t-l-e-
s-h-i-p whats that she puzzled

  a big floating war vessel i suppose he whispered

  read on

   a slight concussion is enough to explode this ma-
terial  she continued more rapidly  for tbis rea-
son especial care has been taken to seal the canister
hermetically and to protect it from shock in a sub-
terranean room  then followed instructions for
moving the exhibit if it were ever found necessary

  do you suppose it has deteriorated  she pondered

  he said nothing for a moment then replied  sup-
pose it has its our only chance if we can destroy
the life factory it probably will disrupt the air patrd
so that we can escape-if we can steal an air car

hunger and the desperateness of their situation
forgotten eve threw back her splendid head with
the old reckless gesture

  ill drop the canister from the balcony she cried
if i live we shall escape i feel it

  but adam shook his head its my place to do this
thing i will creep over the roof spaces to-night to
the warehouse entrance and may succeed in reaching
the gallery one chance in a thousand to escape or
overpower the guards-and i am stronger than you

  in spite of her entreaties he persisted finally she
stopped trying to dissuade him kissed him tenderly
and said no more

  gently they lifted the long steel canister and carried
it as near as they dared to the entrance of the museum
there tbey wrapped it in cloths and adjusted straps
about it so that adam could swing it over his shoulders

  i will ask to take a night flight in the air car the
last man plotted wana will humor me because i look
so ill and she suspects nothing then before the car
arrives i will take the canister and try to drop it from
the balcony when you hear the explosion overpower
wana instantly and drive to the entrance of the ware-
house can you do that he queried noticing her
sagging shoulders

  she straightened quickly and the tired lines left her
face yes she nodded wana is old and i am yet
strong

  the final arrangements were quickly made wana
acceded to what she called her wards foolish whim
he asked her not to disturb him while he took a short
sleep and to bring the car in an hour this also she
agreed to

  then as midnight approached he slipped to the en-
trance shouldered the grey canister wrapped his robe
about him in concealing folds and crept into the park

  cautiously he worked his way among the trees then
when the way seemed clear crept into a building across
the square evading the watchwoman he started
mounting the many flights of unused stairs toward the
roof spaces his heart pounded under the unused ex-
ertion but he persisted resting at landing after land-
ing

  as he had hoped the door to the roof was unlocked
he pushed it open and crept out upon the citys glassy
shield which extended for miles in all directions and
was broken only by the tops of the greatest of the
crystal skyscrapers

  a heavy rain was falling the glass was wet and
the last man



slippery and his load made him clumsy but he stag-
gered along toward the life factory which he knew
lay about a mile to the northward

  hiding under eaves and projections when search-
lights from the skyscraper tops swept the blank ex-
panse and dodging out as soon as the beams passed
he pushed forward doggedly

  at last the tower of the factory loomed before him
across the open expanse of its park he tried the roof
door of the warehouse in which lay the secret passage
it was locked the legislature was taking no chances
with roaming atavists in fact he knew that several
hundred female retrogrades had been killed since the
falling of the balustrade

 in desperation he hammered upon the door with
clenched lists perhaps someone would investigate he
held his ear to the jamb footsteps approached from
within it was a lower level guard

  whos there came the challenge

  one of the roof guard he replied in feigned ex-
citement theres an atavist at large on the roof
spaces i need help

  quickly he laid the canister on the roof and crouched
beside the door would the ruse work

  unsuspecting the dull-witted guard turned the lock
and stepped upon the roof he flung himself upon her
with fury before she realized the situation pinioning
her arms so that she could not reach her weapons he
hurled her to the roof her head struck sharply against
a grating her struggles ceased

  snatching the canister he leaped inside and locked
the door he would have to chance her reviving and
warning the real roof guard

  not daring to use the elevators he raced down the
stairs just escaping disastrous falls more than once
by a miracle he missed the other guards and at last
stood before the panel

  shielding the noise as much as possible he blew the
whistle and gave the combination

  the door swung open and closed behind him safe
so far

  at last he stood again upon the balcony below
the room seemed filled with armed soldiers a rope
ladder dangled from the ledge to the floor hundreds of
feet below not five feet in front of him drowsing
over her rifle stood a guard the secret had been dis-
covered a second perhaps and she would turn 

  tearing the tnt from his back he hurled it at
the steel armor which still covered the life globe below
and said a swift prayer to a forgotten god

  things happened with amazing swiftness and clarity
the guard in front had heard him she whirled her
rifle at ready

then-there was nothing he felt himself drift-
ing in a world without sound or light at peace
hours afterward it seemed an agonizing pain awak-
ened him into consciousness

  he peered into blackness-a soundless still opacity
a wild desire to scream came over him he shouted
but heard no sound remembering his flashlight be
tried it find it in the pocket of his robe only to dis-

cover that the robe was gone and that his right aft
dangled uselessly

  with his sound arm he felt about him two feet
along the balcony his hand descended into space back
of him the wall had a jagged rent extending as far as
he could reach the truth of the situation dawned
upon him the explosion had been so terrific as to
tear away all of the balcony except a tiny projection
upon which he lay

  fearfully he felt his way along this was his escape
cut off he touched the edges of the doorway safe
unable to stand he crept down the stairs on hands and
knees half of the steps seemed missing once he
fell five or six feet but he persisted

  a sense of power filled him the life serum was no
more he knew the top of the life factory dome must
have been blown off by the concussion he owed his
life to a miracle but he had succeeded

  there was one thing more to be done what was
that his brain reeled and plunged escape es-
cape  the thought spurred his lagging senses down
-down-always down one step-two-a dozen-
then a dizzy slip through darkness where the steps
had been torn away by the blast oil on into the
depths of darkness

  at last he reached the portal the pitch pipe
where was it gone with his robe and the flash-
light 

  drawing himself together he tried to remember the
notes were they c d and a or s d and f he
whistled the latter as nearly in the tone of the pipe as
possible

  tn reply came merely a jumbled whirring clicking
sound he tried again-c d and f this time the
whirring was a little clearer and he fancied he heard
a blurred corpse of the word want

  --- he answered  then held bis
breath

  a jarring sound of dislocated machinery was the
only answer the door remained closed

  frantically he hurled himself against it with the
sudden strength of a maniac he beat upon the edge

  it gave

  slowly grinding and jarring it swung open-an
inch-two-six there it stuck he forced his shoul-
der through the aperture still more it gave once
again push it swung wide open and he fell faint-
ing to the floor outside

  another interval then an insistent voice seemed
calling

  where are you adam the words rang inside
his head who was it he was dead why bother
nothingmattered

  but again the command came hurry adam
hurry i am waiting it is eve all the lights have
gone out the guard isdemoralized we can escape
you are not dead foolish one come

  slowly with swaying head he crept on all fours
toward the entrance of the warehouse even here
the force of the explosion had been felt bales of
goods parts of machines mangled bodies were scat-
tered in all directions semi-conscious he squirmed
amazing stories

tinder the debris-over it-on and on toward the
entrance where eve with the air car ready was bend-
ing every atom of her being into that telepathic urge
once he placed his hand on a cold face and screamed

  he reached the door cool air fanned his bleeding
forehead he saw the car but the effort had been
too great he slumped forward a sudden heap

he recovered consciousness to find eve bathing his
face and talking tenderly to him as to a child
he opened his eyes his head was in her lap in the
cockpit of the air car it was morning behind them
the motor coughed gently he was alive and free

  where are we headed he breathed as he smiled
up at her dear face through the waves of pain which
threatened to engulf him again

  toward the mountains she replied kissing him
tenderly there we can hide there we can be
happy

  then as if she had forgotten the greater purpose of
their flight she was silent for a long moment at last
she added softly

  there if we are not discovered and can live like
the animals a new and finer race may yet be born
as she ceased speaking the first rays of the rising
sun splashed into the cockpit a shower of pale gold

as amazing treatment of mrs harris menace of mars evidently from one of her admirers

 editor amazing stonies

   after having repressed the elemental urge to
 communicate with you tor some eight months and
 in consequcnee subjecting my subconscious as
 modern psychological parlance catalogues it to all
 the blasting turbulence of an unadulterated hades
 to-day i feel liberated from my freudian complex-
 divinely disembodied i feel like the absolute in
 nirvana so you may expect a little criticism which
  hope will reflect to your ultimate credit

   the menacc of mars was a highly plausible
 tale it is hyper-imaginative and as far as that
 goes it is a tribute to and riot a tribulation of
 its creator mrs harris it always gives me a
 stimulus to ee an abstruse metaphysical speculation
 -the abstraction of formality garbed with the in-
 nervating robes of imagery predatory scientists
 in their avid quest fcr brilliantly immutable facts
 exhibit a slant towards mental fixation it is just
 this geometrical rigidity that is a janus while it
 appeals to the technician and to the philosophic
 pundit who loves perfection more than life whose
 vocation is speculation to the average human being
 it holds little attraction save perhaps as the magni-
 tude or incredibility of the fact awakens a parallel
 response in the homo sapiens construction since
 the normal human being prefers his data of the
 external world in romantically inconsistent version
 it is c xtremely essential that fictions shall be
 created about facts in pleasantly possible situa-
 tions man experiences vicariously the emotions
 of the literary creations he is reading about for
 that reason fictions of novel expository import
 serve to elevate the creature of free will within the
 confines of mechanism from the sordid level of
 sense experience and humdrum routine incon-
 sistency therefore enlivens life preventing extreme
 intellectual specialization which would inevitably
 end in automatism thus robbing the one so afflicted
 of his own individuality the author of the
 menace of mars however has yet a long and
 arduous trail to relative metaphysical perfection
 in this she has my wishes for the success of her
 venture if the inconsequential efforts of one so
 addicted may accelerate her progress

   the story evidences a curious admixture of ob-
 jective dispassionateness and a specious sophistry
 i say this not with an arrogated omniscience but
 merely as a self-evident analysis it is objectively
 analytic inasmuch as it excludes human prejudice
 even in the storys context but paradoxically enough
 when the author is well within the outer fortifica-
 tions of depersonalized synthesis she foolishly falls
 a victim to a common error of the popular mind
 that of anthropomorphism investing the inhabi-

 	tants of the martian planet with the attributes of

man a highly emotional and malevolent one at
that the basic philosophy of the story though
probably not easily perceptible to a superficial
scrutinizing is the jaded husk of mechanism in
its most rudimentary form the story is thus
an atavism to which the author has recourse for
no apparent reason when there are so many logical
systems that could have been annexed with no
extra expenditure of energy radiant energy ac-
cording to the author is the end and cause of
everything-of course obviously this is a malignant
world obviously human beings are only excres-
cences not at all teleological agents obviously
since there is theoretically such a thing as friction-
less action there must be some universal end
which is an all inclusive realization of all poten-
tiality which even infinitesimal electrons frolicking
erratically through an enormous inter-play of energy
are striving toward as a common aim-manifestly
it is so-didnt the author pre-suppose it even
assuming that radiant energy was the basis of
all existence and a universal harmonic synthesis
and the ultimate aim-where did radiant energy
receive its primal impulse science doesnt pro-
fess to know the religionist pushing back the
skein of logic one more step offers god as the
creator of all but yet there remains unanswered
the insistent query who or what created god
did he exist since the beginning is time non-
existent fcr him or is he identical with the toy
of the enamored metaphysicist the absolute log-
ically there was a first cause even if a beginning
or any casual force is remotely pre-supposed now
since i have pointed out that which i believe to
be manifest concerning mrs harris charming tale
she will readily perceive that metaphysics should
be treated by an individual of the trade perhaps
she unconsciously transgressed the limits of scienti-
fiction in that case i revoke my criticism and
praise her genius

  with the hopes that you still remained physio-
logically unchanged i am mr editor a booster
of amazing sicries internally externally and
eternally

  mrs harris has certainly won a great deal of
favor from our readers we are glad to see you
criticising bccause we do not want praise to the
exclusion of real appreciation we appreciate
highly your analysis of the story but as we have
said more than once you cannot look for strict
science in the interstellar space flier story the dis-
tances in interplanetary space are so great that
unendurable acceleration of speed has to be as-

sumed by a sort of poetic license but allowing
for this and for some other liberties taken with
rigid accuracy much scientific atmosphere will
be found in the stories in question and the
trouble  is that our readers like them we
are sure that many who have read the stories of
this type in amazing stories have assimilated
a lot of the science of the cosmic system of our
part of the universe-editor

  an appreciation from canada

editor amazing stories

i want to take the opportunity of expressing my
appreciation of your publication

i came to canada two years ago from scotland
and discovered amazing stories there since
that time i have never missed a publication

i do not intend to discuss in detail the contents
of your magazine because such a discussion would
involve too much space and time i will say this
however i am a librarians son and ever since early
boyhood have been an omnivorous reader never
in all my experience of books have i come across
any literature in which one could find such a vari-
ance of food for thought that is a strong state-
ment to make but  do not think it can be dis-
puted in amazing stories one finds comment
made on practically every subject directly or in-
directly which can bear discussion

i wish your magazine every success and heres
hoping that by this time next year people wlio
up to the present time have only glanced at the
covers and said sensationalism will have had
the common sense to look inside and find out for
themselves just exactly what they have been
missing

                      lain mciiairn

the pas manitoba canada

    we are interested in this communication be-
cause it comes  from a librarians son and who
ever since his boyhood days seems to have been
turned loose upon books which is one of the best
ways of bringing up a boy this makes his com-
plimentary remarks of special value because he
knows whereof he writes so we will accept his com-
pliments as valid ones we have always held that
we appreciate brickbats of course unfavorable
criticism is very usual in many cases but we feel
ourselves fortunate in getting so little of it we
often think that our correspondents are almost too
appreciative of out humble work it is surprising
how few of the letters criticize us unfavorably

continued from page 

have no doubt that you can persuade them to publish
the story of it there

  and to communicate with the earth through the
mind i say this to the one who translates the manuscript
in this cylinder if it lands in a country that has a
different tongue than that of germany i will be in
your place in the mind at three oclock on the day
after the notice appears in the paper and will endeavor
to communicate with you mentally put yourself in
a position to receive my thoughts by concentration upon
the fact that you can receive my mental message should
i find a reccptive mind i will tell of the way to use
the power of the suns rays to do the work that
electricity does and more i will tell of the wonders
that  have seen upon the far off planets of different
solar systems

  mernos is to be my future home i have no desire
to return to the earth except in the mind to see the
discord that rules there would that the earth could
attain the state of perfection that exists on mernos
perhaps my message if received may have some effect
on bringing that condition a little nearer

xvi

iiiexry james again take up the pen when
professor margchtcs had finished the last line and
i had transcribed it we stood looking at each other
in amazement

  gott in himmel exclaimed the professor vat
a vundcrful message

  yes i replied and who will believe it

  very few but we must get it before the world
he called the boston post on long distance and told
them that a message had been received from another
planet they laughed at him until he told them it was
professor margehtes and that name carried weight
enough to have them send a reporter a line in the
paper brought out several more and in the next three
days we were besieged by reporters some openly
scoffed at the strange tale but others were convinced
they examined the cylinder and the flexible glass and
admitted that they had never seen anything like it
before

  headlines were carried in all the papers and as pro-
fessor von altenberg was a german the german papers
broadcast it in screaming type on the first page which
of course was what von altenberg or guros julio had
requested some of the papers spoke of it as the most
gigantic hoax ever attempted but a few took it as a
fact and soberly declared that it opened up unheard
of possibilities

the fact that guros julio was to attempt to com-

municate mentally was of interest to all and several
scientists came posthaste to my observatory to see if
the attempt would be a success i had no way of
knowing at that time on just what day the headlines
appeared in the german papers as there was little com-
munication on account of the war so every afternoon
after it was given to the world we met in the observa-
tory before three oclock and waited patiently for some-
thing to conie it was the third day after the news had
been published in the american papers and quite a
little group was in the observatory as i remember it
there were professor simplon of washington profes-
sor davidsky of petrograd professor hartbeest of
south africa and a half dozen reporters the profes-
sors of the foreign universities happened to be in bos-
ton at the time the find was published and came right
out to see for themselves

  several mind-readers and clairvoyants wanted to be
there also but i had denied them that privilege why
i do not know unless it was because i was very skepti-
cal about them

  the hands on the clock dragged slowly and finally
reached three oclock everyone was tensed for the
possible message from guros julio i doubted if he
could communicate with the earth-mind and most of
them agreed with me but professor margehtes was
sure that he would find a way

  he is here he is here suddenly cried margehtes

  all eyes were on margehtes as he began to speak

  guros julio you arc here and i feel your pres-
ence we thank you for the message from mernos

  margehtes was not alone in the reception of the re-
ply for i too got the mind message from guros julio

  thank you for your faith in me was imprinted on
my mind as clearly as if the words had been spoken
teach the conditions on mernos wherever you can

i	will return in the mind later

  that was all but it showed that mental communica-
tion could be had with guros julio professor davidsky
got a part of the message and was convinced of the
truth of the talc as were nearly all the others i am
now trying to study concentration in order that i may
freely communicate with guros julio when next he
visits my observatory i am in hopes that i can per-
fect myself in this so that i can learn the secrets of
the machines of memos and give those secrets to the
world the way is opening for us to learn the secret
of harnessing the power of the sun long the dream of
many scientists perhaps others will study out this
mental communication and get from a mernosian
the ideas that will revolutionize the world i long to
attain mind separation that i too may roam at will
in the vastness of the universe

the deadly mathematics applied
to kemptonia

  editor amazing stories

    so many good stories have appeared in amazing
  stories that up to now i have refrained from
  registering any complaints about the poor science-
  or total lack of it-displayed by a few of your
  authors this time however i can no longer
  restrain myself

    in the october issue there is one story in par-
  ticular that arouses my ire this is the voyage
  to kcmptonia had the author of this atrocity re-
  frained from giving dimensions and figures things
  would not have been so bad here is the informa-
  tion he gives the reader

    distance of kemptonia above surface of earth
   miles period  days surface area 
  acrcs loss of weight of bodies transported from
  earth to kemptonia  now look at this

    if a body could revolve about the earth at such
  a distance in the earths atmosphere by the way
  it would do so in a period of  days or if
  its period were  days it would be  miles
  from the earths center if the body was of the
  same density as the earth it would probably be
  much less an object would weigh only 
  of the amount that it would weigh on the earth
  hence a normal man instead of weighing  lbs
  would weigh only  lbs he could stride 
  feet and leap  feet as easily as six on the
  earth

    the magnifying power of a telescope is given in
  diameters not magnitudes and can be changed
  instantly by swinging another eyepiece into posi-
  tion-a power as low as twenty is not practical
  with a large telescope and the light elimination
  lining is foolish

    a body the size of kemptonia would be read-
  ily visible to the naked eye subtending at its clos-
  est approach an angle of over six and one half
  degrees-thirteen times the apparent diameter of
  the moon

    another author makes a slip in this issue in
  the menace of mars the author speaks of
  antares being seen in the west after sunset on
  april  on april  antares would have set
  several hours before the sun it is seen in the
  southwest after sunset in october does this
  author know that mars has extensive tracts of
  vegetation it has and moreover the canals
  arc not cracks but vegetation

    having delivered this broadside of brickbats
  i will close with a few bouquets the skylark
  of space was excellent-even though the authors
  did play havoc with the theory of relativity dr
  kellers biological experiment was very fine and
  contained some beautiful thoughts armageddon-
   a d was very good station x is one
  of the tost you have published the red dust-
  and the other by the same author-were very fine
  all of wells i liked though i have read them all
  years ago

    i am enclosing the computations from which
  the results given in my criticism of the voyage
  to kemptonia were derived but i dont suppose
  they would interest your readers hoping that
  your authors watch their sciencc a little closer in
  the future i am

    this interesting letter is accompanied by a
  sheet of calculations which we do not reproduce
  but are keeping on our file for any of our readers
  who want to follow this very valuable critique
  we arc delighted to see that while our correspond-
  ent inclined to pick kemptonia to pieces some of
  our other stories please him greatly the trouble
  is that our readers want to enjoy interplanetary
  stories and if any one can write one without
  indulging in a considerable license of treatment
  and yet make a good story of it we will be glad
  to sec his work as regards the canals on mars
  and vegetation of the same planet we are inclined

  termined if they ever will be-editor

the set

   dr keller was chosen by the publishers of
 thesevolumes as being one of the few physicians
 in america who could write on so delicate a
 subject in language that even a child could un-
 derstand heretofore educational sex books
 have been written by professionals usually in
 such technical language that the non-profes-
 sional reader could not understand it conse-
 quently the sexual educational series can
 be read by anyone as a matter of fact much
 of the subject matter has been written for
 young people

   while writing these books dr keller wrote
 a long letter to the publishers part of which
 follows

   my idea is to write in simple language
   in a conversational or lecture style or to
   use the language of my wife just as you
   talk to us i my wife is a college graduate
   and taught eight years in the high schools
   of the south one daughter is preparing
   to study medicine and the other is just
   about to graduate from our local high
   shool and i consider their advice and
   opinion as a very good index of the average
   mentality of our expected readers my
   ultimate aim is to make the world a little
   better place to live in by educating the
   masses along the lines which have previ-
   ously been inaccessible to them in writ-
   ing i am going to keep in mind that
   we want to help folks to be-
   come happier

 most of the misery and suffering in human
 life can be directly attributed to sex misinfor-
 mation dr keller in these books offers a
 solution for this evil as well as for other and
 perhaps greater evils the author knows his
 subject as few other physicians in the country
 know it and as a well-known author he is able
 to write in such a way that there is nothing
 offensive even for the most unsophisticated of
 young girl

  parents have not as yet arrived at the state
where they can be perfectly frank in matters
of sex with their children but henceforth
dr kellers valuable books can be safely en-
trusted to all intelligent young people the
older generation themselves will find much of
value in the scries

  there is little question but that these books
will become famous will blaze a new trail
they will be read and reread for more thorough
comprehension of the subject matter involved
the sexual education series gives you fact
and knowledge contained in the highest type of
literature with the exception that it is written
down to the understanding of the every-day
man and woman girl and bow the excellent
anatomical drawings which are profusely dis-
tributed through these books are so mechani-
cally treated that they will never arouse the
sensibilities of even the greatest prude yet they
are an education in themselves dr keller has
torn the veil of mystery from sex matters and
presented to the american public the true facts of
sexual life he has debunked sex

  these books are printed in brand new type the
subject matter has never been published before

 some odd theories about light
 waves the action of a high tension
 line on a distant telephone system

  editor amazing stories

  i have never been able to find a magazine so en-
  tertaining as yours it acts as a stimulant for the
  brain what i wonder at is this why has not
  some writer made an interesting story about the
  clcctro-magnetic semi-circle around the earth now
  if i could write i would surely hop to it for i
  happen to have seen quite a bit of some mighty
  queer things that ought to be good for stories
  here is one if light was refined by reflectors
  tuned to a certain light vibration only and then
  this vibration was amplified and tuned to different
  degrees of a wave by means of a heterodyne sys-
  tem you would have a perfect system of making
  anything of anybody from idiot to superman well
  what could a real writer do with that

  regarding letter and answer to norman h moore
  of canada

  your answer is incomplete and almost wrong a
  high tension line can affect a telephone line 
  meters away if the commutator ripples in both
  lines if dc current would synchronize or the
  generator ripple of the phone line equal the ac
  there would be h- to pay in the phone line
  there may also be a current drop in the high
  tension line due to a dense line caused by high
  frequency currents set up through this electrical
  sympathy but your error is excusable as very
  few ever had trouble of that nature in their work
  and therefore do not know anything about it

                           address missing

  we like the point of view you have about our
  magazine being a stimulant for the brain you
  will see in another letter in our discussions
  columns that one of our readers was incited to con-
  struct a -inch reflecting telescope by the effect
  which amazing stories has produced your sug-
  gestions for stories are quite clever perhaps
  some of our authors will use them

  your statements about the reaction between the
  high potential line and the distant telephone line
  arc quite interesting do you not think that be-
  cause very few ever had trouble of that nature
  that it must be very rare and unusual  mile
  is a long way for the action of lines of force to be
  effective-editor

one of our readers

  editor amazing stories

    in beginning allow me to compliment you upon
  the publishing of such a magazine for such a price
  of course you have good stories as well as bad
  stories some of them are good scientifiction while
  others arc not as to the stories themselves
  among the outstanding stories published by you
  arc columbus of space skylark of space
  island of dr moreau station x and others
  of such ilk those that did not strike me as well
  written scientifiction are a story of days to
  come too dry and full of detail there arc
  many scientific mistakes in the invisible man
  by h g wells here is one if our friend was
  able to make invisible o piece of linen then why
  when he has made himself invisible cannot be per-
  form the same feat upon his clothes it is not
  up to me to criticize stories of the poor type but
  those of the good type the menace of mars
  is very well written but i must disagree with the
  author as well as mr gernshack on the theory
  about which the story is written we not the
  laymen are all familiar with the electronic theory
  no doubt but when one attempts to claim that
  the earth may be an electron of an atom of a gas
  liquid or solid that is another matter it is
  known that the nucleus of an atom is composed
  of protons and electrons in varying degrees while
  the element is determined by the number of elec-
  trons that revolve about this nucleus as far as
  i can see i cannot understand how one can con-
  sider our solar system as a larger atom surely
  if we consider the sun as a proton and its planets
  as electrons you cannot make me believe that
  protons have an orbital path around the nucleus for
  the electrons certainly counterbalance the proton
  within the nucleus if it can be shown that the
  solar system can be considered as a cosmic
  atom then will i believe until then im from
  missouri the facts are against it

    nothing much can be said about to the moon
  by proxy except that it is well written and
  contains excellent science reprisal may have
  been well written but does not meet with my
  approval the only thing mentioned there that
  might be scientific is his explanation of the diverted
  gulf stream the same applies to the voyage
  to kemptonia the only scicntific thing is his
  mention of the new or extra terrestrial body the
  explanation or description of the characters on that
  body indicates that they may be lunarians

    i say more from the pens of b and geo c
 wallis their the world at bay is a master-
 piece in the acientifiction field none of their light
 rays are new i have come across the disintegrating
 ray before and am callous to it therefore other-
 wise there is no fault as it is a possibility al-
 though  hope it is not probable one need not
 discuss ir keller his stories are already well
 known though i believe he made a mistake in
 writing the menace scries it may give the
 colored people some thought no science at ail
 in the ananias gland very much surprised to
 see it published all he docs is let you know
 that it docs not pay to lie all the time or tell the
 truth all the time but to have a mixture of both
 no criticism about the moon men it is very
 well written and contains excellent science the
 fye of the vulture is also very good among your
 best stories were the man who was and the
 other i believe is the telepathic pick-up the
 last mentioned is a very good method of explaining
 the radio principle for a thought pick-up as
 dairacd by the editor the living test tube
 idea is an old one  didnt like it

    in conclusion allow me to state that i would
 appreciate more stories of the caliber stated in
 my first paragraph among which i number sta-
 tion x as the best

    paul is very realistic let him keep up the
 fod work his drawings arc realistic plus

                   samuel jarfinxel

 avenue m brooklyn n v

    if an author writes about visiting mars or of
 taking a short run oft to the moon he simply has
 to make a story out of it and acceleration is
 one of the things which from the scientific stand-
 point suffers acutely our correspondent says that
 one story is full of detail but this is the very life
 of narration and abundance of detail with conver-
 sation and dialogue marks the best fiction there is
 so do not object to detail without it the stories
 would be very flat the invisible man dealing
 with an impossibility is peculiarly open to criticism
 and you must expect some very remarkable occur-
 rences in it

    wc are certainly inclined to feel exactly as you
 do about the earth being an electron in a giant
 atom whose proton is the sun it is an old story
 to say that the truth should not always be spoken
 this has been worked out in many a story the
 point being that we are not obliged to talk per-
 petually but that wc can leave our destinies to
 that extent wc certainly appreciate the work
 you put into this letter we are glad to hear
 you admire paul so much-editor

a very flattering tribute to
amazing stories and its
editorials

 editor amazing stories

    recently i have noticed several accounts run-
 ning in the newspapers about a well known scientist
 who had accomplished another one of the impos-
 sibles by communicating with mars via radio
 this happened in england during the fourth week
 of october the associated press and the united
 press dispatched many of the stories to the pub-
 lications here in america and i am sure these
 stories were printed in nearly every newspaper
 in the country for that reason i believe you are
 already acquainted with the facta  of the
 affair nevertheless i am sending along one clip-
 ping of one of the stories

 i am anxious to know if this is all a farce or
 is it really fact i would like to have you state
 your opinion and conclusions on this in some
 future edition of amazing stories perhaps its
 all simply a publicity stunt yet the associated
 press and the united press news services are of
 course wise to such things and i do not believe
 that the news vriters would write such stories
 if the facts were not proven i have had some
 experience in this line myself i would like to
 see an editorial by you on this soon in amazing
 stories

 amazing stories has progressed much during
 the time it has been on the newsstands i believe
 and after reading close to ninety-nine copies of
 it is this not right i cannot praise it too highly

 it may be of some interest to you to know that
 amazing stories has proven its merit several
 times in our local high school excerpts from
 several of the stories as well as facts from the
 editorials have lcen used as references for students
 in geography history mathematics etc indeed
 the entire editorial in the november issue ws
 read by the instructor to the biology class recently
 the substance of the editorial was exactly parallel
 with the work being studied by the class i wish
 to congratulate the editor on his work in amazing
 stqries-the editorials are always interesting

please sa

    we think you arc perfectly safe in treating the
  alleged communication of mars as an utter absurd-
  ity to use a mild expression- it was given such
  a publicity in england that international press
  services had to give it space while we try to
  bring out the scientific cast of amazing stories
  by the questionnaire there is liable to be a lot
  of science touched upon in the discussion column
  we are glad so many of our readers have ex-
  pressed warm appreciation of the editorials we
  have not yet rcachcd number  of amazing
  stories-editor

the type of stories desired by one

reader pauls pictures-love
motif in a story

  editor amazing stories

    i have read your very interesting magazine for
  almost two years but this is the first time i ever
  tried to invade your sanctum with a letter i find
  the letters from your readers most interesting for
  they show what a wide range of tastes prevails
  among the patrons of amazing stories

    first i want to say that your cover designs are
  original striking usually artistic and just what
  your magazine needs to attract new readers with
  the newsstands so cluttered up today with sexy
  stories smutty stories western stories war
  stories and the like the contents of which are as
  alike as peas in a pod it is necessary for a maga-
  zine of the type of am zing stories to have a cover
  design that gives the prospective buyer an immedi-
  ate idea of its contents i well remember it was
  the cover design that led me to buy my first copy
  of amazing stories had it not been for the
  picture on the cover i would have passed it up as
  just another one of those magazines and so
  missed some delightful hours spent in the perusal
  of your pages

    now as to the type of stories i prefer assum-
  ing that you are interested first interplanetary
  stcries they have always had the greatest fascina-
  tion for me i can read them for hours and not
  tire of them second stories of the fourth dimen-
  sion and stories of advanced science also stories
  of the future

    there is just one fault i have to find with
  your stories and that is only with some of
  them yours is a scientific magazine and there
  are hundreds of magazines catering to the roman-
  tic type why do your writers write a perfectly
  fascinating interplanetary or futuristic story scien-
  tifically correct in every detail and then throw in
  a girl usually named ooomlag or poo-bah or sook
  sook or some such juvenile name who falls in love
  with the earth hero and does most unconvincing
  things to show her love usually getting killed at the
  end of the story cease the bloodshed let the poor
  oomlags poo-bahs and sook-sooks stay out of the
  story altogether the people who read your mag-
  azineare i believe more interested in the unusual
  features of the story than in a certainly mediocre
  love plot thrown in as a cook at the last minute
  throws in a piece of onion to make the stew more
  tasty it is quite possible i am wrong many peo-
  ple have to have some mushy stuff in everything
  they read even if its the congressional rccord

    nojv that is the only kick i have to register
  against your very excellent magazine and most likely
  that kick is out of order so please retain your
  artist paul and tell him to make his cover designs
  as striking as he pleases and dont be stingy about
  illustrating the stories

    do you not think that the editor of a magazine
  such as amazing stories is to be sympathized
  with precisely because his readers have such a wide
  range of tastes as you express it in your first
  paragraph we like your criticisms of our cover
  designs every one has been studied out in order to
  present the scientific aspect of the story it illustrates
  and we see nothing in them to frighten people
  away the mere fact that there is so much to be
  shown on each cover apparatus and general de-
  tails along with the personnel of the story makes
  the picture rather full and sometimes what an
  artist would call a rather big spot of color and
  we believe that this unavoidable character is what
  has awakened some unmeaning criticisms its
  cover designs are certainly very distinctive and
  differ from those of other magazines it is inter-
  esting to notice that with so many others you like
  interplanetary stories and stories of the fourth di-
  mension these stories absolutely demand and are
  entitled to a considerable degree of license but
  there will always be found in them a thread of true
  science many generations of readers have liked
  love stories so you cannot blame our authors for
  yielding to some of their readers who wish to
  read about loves young dream however we
  doubt if you will find mushy stuff in the con-
  gressional record we have not the least idea of
  parting company with tbe artist paul-editor

professor poor and the fourtb
dimension

  editor amazing stowes

    tbe long put off time to write to your dicu
  fcions columns is at band i am a sophomore
  chemical engineer at the university of michigan
  and have l-een reading your publications since the
  days of the old electrical experimenter i have
  all the copies of your magazine which have ytt ap-
  peared except two or three and on v additional
  sheet enclosed here you will find my orders for
  them and for the renewal of my subscription

    i have so much to say that i hardly know where
  tc start so t will note the various things a they
  come to me

    the first and most important item is this i re-
  lieve that if your covers were just a littl less
  fantastic you would have a much larger circulation
  i have repeatedly had people who had never seen
  the tnopflsiite before take one look at the name and
  cover design and immediately say what do you
  read that imaginative trash and bunkum for-what
  good is it i have even seen people on the buses
  look at a copy under my arm and openly give me
  a pitying look i have noticed that some of your
  other readers agree with me entirely on this point
  i do not say that your artists are not good-on
  the contrary i think they are excellent but their
  efforts are merely a little too brilliant

    by all means let us have the pleasure of read-
  ing some more stories by murray leinster and f
  mcleod winsor-i think that the latters station
  x was the best story you have ever published
  with the land that time forgot the color
  out of space and treasures of tantalus elose
  behind it i have also much praise to offer your
  doctor-authors drs keller  breuer and mr bob
  olsen for his plausible explanation that the fourth
  dimension could exist in fourth dimensional sur-
  gery

    i am much in favor of having the quarterly-
  perhaps in time amazinv stories will be a semi
  monthly magazine do you intend to publish another
  annual this summer or have i missed it

    the comments of so many readers on the theory
  that time is or is not the fourth dimension amuse
  me greatly although i agree with h g wells
  when he says that an instantaneous cube could
  have no real existence nevertheless i would rather
  take the viewpoint of bob olsen in four dimen-
  sional surgery

    if one is going to start adding other dimensions
  to the linear ones why not group all the linear di
  mensions under the one word position then the
  other necessary dimensions could possibly be
  taken as time and mass for example an
  object such as a chair could not exist without being
  located in some one place it could not exist with-
  out a definite size and weight nor could it exist if
  it had no time of existence-that is if it never ex-
  isted i realize that i have mixed up my meaning
  of mass by putting in the words size and weight-
  it would have leen simpler to just say mass of
  course i am not saying that this is my pet
  theory-it is merely my way of showing that it is
  hard to say which are dimensions and which are
  not

    in your editorial comment on mr l a maples
  letter in the september issue you quote something
  from prof poors gravitation vs relativity
  which i question    as the speed of my room
  increased my desk clock would run more and more
  slowly each tick would represent the passing of an
  hour or a day  of our ordinary earthly time
     at the end of half an hour by my clock i would
  have traversed the depths of space and returned
  home    prof poor then goes on to say that
  he would find that time on the earth had progressed
  several centuries while it was only a half hour to
  him now the ordinary span of human life is
  somewhat less than  years-why then would he
  not die of old age during his half hour trip on
  the other hand if he in some manner managed to
  prolong bis life and did return to the earth after
  several centuries surely the effects of traveling
  through space must have slightly injured his clock
  as it only registered a half hour

    i realize of course that if what mr kinstein
  says is true that time varies with motion that an
  hour is not always an hour then i am wrong
  but otherwise i cannot understand it

                        harry ii purcell
                             iawton
                            detroit mich

    our correspondent asks for enlightenment and
  we in our editorial modesty hardly feel that we can
  give it to him the minute most people take up
  the fourth dimension and kinstein they are apt to
  find themselves submerged many efforts have
  been made and books have been published to explain
  relativity but with little success from the popular
  standpoint slosson has even gone so far as to
  give a chapter on einstein in words of one
  syllable we think einstein is bard to elucidate
  even in polysyllables-editor

 then i gave my husband
 the surprise of his life

 tpvont be silly mary youre

 ii perfectly foolish to believe you
 can learn to play music by that
 method you are silly to even
 think about it why it claims
 to teach music in half the usual
 time and without a teacher its
 impossible

 that is how my husband felt
 when i showed him an ad telling
 about a new way to learn music

 but how i hated to give up my
 new hope of learning to play the
 piano when i heard others
 playing i envied them so that it
 almost spoiled the pleasure of
 the music for me for they could
 entertain their friends and family    they
 were musicians  had to be satisfied with
 only hearing music

  i was so disappointed i felt very bitter as
  i put away the magazine containing the adver-
  tisement for a week i resisted the tempta-
  tion to look at it again but finally i couldnt
  keep from peeking at it it fascinated me
  so much that finally half-frightened half-
  enthusiastic i wrote to the u s school of
  music-without letting my husband know

 imagine my joy when the lessons started
 and i found that they were as easy as a b c
 why a mere child could master them my
 progress was wonderfully rapid and before i
 realized it i was rendering selections which
 many pupils who study with private teachers
 cant play for thru this short-cut method
 all the difficult tiresome parts of music have
 been eliminated and the playing of melodics
 has been reduced to a simplicity which anyone
 can follow with ease

 finally i decided to play for jack and
 show him what a crazy course had taught
 me so one night when he was sitting read-
 ing i went casually over to the piano and
 started playing a lovely song words cant
 describe his astonish-
 ment why    why
    he floundered
 i simply smiled and
 went on playing but
 soon jack insisted that
 i tell him where i had
 learned    when   
 how so i told of
 my secret

                        one day not long
                      after my husband
                      came to me and said
                      mary dont laugh
                      but i want to try
                      learning to play the

please say	saw if in amazing

the hfth dimension and the edi-
torial an amazing phenomenon

  editor amazing stories

    i have just finished reading the fifth dimen-
  sion and your interesting editorial an amaz-
  ing phenomenon in the december number

    while i quite agree with you regarding our re-
  turn after death to human form albeit in minute
  particlcs widely distributed as to time and personnel
  in the bodies we will inhabit i far from agree with
  you in your idea that we will retain enough memory
  cells in one piece to have even a fraction of a
  thought that we had in a previous existence

    your idea is too fantastic and far-fetched for so
  simple a matter particularly the instance to which
  you refer that of the sccne from the train inas-
  much as steam trains are a relatively modern inven-
  tion you could hardly have seen that bit of land-
  scape from cxactly the same angle a thousand or
  five thousand years ago even had there been no
  changes in the scene

    i have often had the same impression and have
  applied a theory i heard of as a boy i think it was
  a surmise of henry james though i forget just
  where i got it and i have always fouifd that the
  so-called phenomenon occurs under certain definite
  rules i am cither very tired or bored or under
  the influence of a monotonous sound or movement
  or both such as the jogging of a horse the rumble
  of a train etc in other words i am half asleep

    and there is your answer we lapse into momen-
  tary naps under such circumstances then start
  awake the trend of thought has been broken and
  the impression we had a split-second ago returns as
  a memory test this out the next time you are
  conscious of this phenomenon in about thirty
  years experience i have found it to fit the cir-
  cumstances in both my own case and in those of
  all others who have related similar cases to me

    i have read your magazine since the first edition
  and hope that you will continue the good work what
  a relief it is to see it on the newsstand amidst all
  the true-what-not trash i thank whatever gods
  there be that at least one publisher is not afraid to
  label his wares fiction no matter how amazing

 your letter embodies a very nice bit of psychol-
 ogy and your theory is very interesting the letter
 tells its story so well that we hardly can add any
 comments to it many of the phenomena which the
 credulous impute to spirits are due to the action
 of the subconscious in ourselves-editor

likes and dislikes

  editor amazing stories

  although i am not an habitual letter writer i
  am writing you now to tell you what i like about
  amazing stories and what i dont because if
  i dont youre liable to take the advice of some of
  those others who write to you and i dont agree
  with all of them im giving you my views in
  self-defense

  in a general way i like my scientifiction short
  long-winded stories riakc me lose interest and the
  more short stories you have the better i like the
  issue the december number was particularly
  pleasing to me on this account its hard to pick
  the best story out of that issue i hesitate between
  the metal man and the appendix and the
  spectacles a flight to venus is fully as en-
  tertaining in parts but only in parts the irony of
  this story lifts it a bit above the ordinary the
  space bender is a fine bit of sarcasm and an in-
  genious exposition of fourth dimensional ideas
  however i can not agree that a thin sheet of
  paper can be considered two-dimensional nothing
  can be so thin that it isnt three-dimensional-not
  even the thinnest sheet of gold leaf and i can prove
  it to you with a good micrometer if there are
  two-dimensional objects we have no means of per-
  ceiving them any more than a four-dimensional
  man could perceive us wrong shadows are per-
  feet two-dimensional objects-editor however
  i dont let such reflections spoil my enjoyment of
  a good dimensional story

  i enjoyed ten minutes of reading and hours of
  pleasant contemplation from out of the sub-uni-
  verse thats what i call a story with a kick
  of course some objections occurrcd to me for
  instance the time it took to raise the little people
  to normal size must have been centuries to them
  we can only assume that the process of changing
  their wavelength temporarily arrested the vital
  processes and that suspended animation prevented
  them from aging rapidly

  heres another question how did the professor
  keep his ultra-cosmic ray focused on one spot of
  electron whicfi was probably revolving and whirling
  on its orbit at the same time dont you suppose
  it is likely that the body of the man and woman
  and their descendants had some subtle attraction for
  the ray which nothing indigenous to electron would

  have ac  large number f t ifm were corgre-
  atrd at tlu appointed place a sjot on the planet
  already polarized ly the initial impingement of the
  ray it is rational to assume that the ray would
  be again drawn to them

    in further proof of this theory let me cite that
  nothing was brought back except the bodies of the
  people had the temple been susceptible to the ray
  from outside it would have been brought back too
  one must further assume that their clothing being
  inintimate contact with them participated in this
  susceptibility possibly the temple did start to come
  up but being less susceptible came more slowly and
  was trampled underfoot by the rapidly growing mob

    i also liked that story monorail while
  theres nothing really extravagant about it its a
  good story as it is it isnt too long and it has
  action the world of the giant ants gets my
  vote too even if it was rather long the world
  at bay would have pleased me better if it had
  been boiled down to about half its length and run
  in one issue

    i notice that a lot of readers liked the facc
  in the abyss lest you think its unanimous let
  me say i didnt like it its mystification not
  scientifiction-more in the order of a fairy talc

    i like h g wells stuff but seem to be out-
  voted i dont can for jules verne because hes
  out of date there arc some other stories which i
  wanted to commend but theyve slipped my mind
  now and i no longer have the magazines as i gave
  them to friends here and there for missionary pur-
  pose they get the first copy from me for nothing
  and some of them buy their copies after that

    i cant find any fault with the covers the paper
  the size of the magazine or the kind of neckties the
  editor wears its all right with me and i grab
  every issue monthly quarterly and annual as they
  appear

    paper i sd in describing two-dimensional
  space as a xrt ut model only so your criticism
  does rot apply we all know that a sheet of paper
  las three dimensions

    it certainly is great praise for a story to say
  that its reading took less time than did the subse-
  quent contemplation of its task and ideas white
  they must involve impossibilities we find that our
  readers like interplanetary stories and wc see you
  are no exception to the rule wc often feel that
  some of our stories are too short but you take quite
  the opposite view your theories of the actions de-
  scribed in out of the sub-universe are quite
  ingenious and really indicates that the story had
  considerable depth

    the world of the giant ants is written by a
  very distinguished explorer who is the author of
  a great many very entertaining kpular scientific
  looks

  we thank you sincerely for your good wishes
  and appreciation of our bumble efforts-editor

    why this great furore over pauls covers and

  really miraculous animal pictures paul rransom to
  a less extent and otto anton fisher whose sea
  drawings are usually perfect pictures of the ships he
  means to illustrate are almost tbe only exceptions
  of which i know

    i rue his human icings sometimes appear to be
  rather queer but then  have seen men in schenec-
  tady who were almost their exact duplicates during
  the last week i took particular notice and as to
  the future who can say the past he has almost
  never dealt with so theres no kick coming there
  too his animals are somewhat strained but there
  are exceptions great ones compare the horse in
  kaws time eliminator and the dinosaurs in the
  land that time forgot with the blasts of the sec-
  ond instalment of the skylark of space or the
  dinosaurs from the way of a dinosaur what
  a difference his horses are without exception
  rather awful hut what is a horse theyre devilish
  bard even to copy when there are martians for the
  asking with no valid excuse for criticism keep it
  up paul youre growing with every issue

    as to covers they are startling but again there
  are exceptions the february  cover illus-
  trating baron munchhausen is to my mind the
  best youve had more like that following this in
  order of preference arc the may  well

 abyss september  the war of tbe
 worlds august  the blue dimension
 june  and the new december issue are
 corkers too in fact theres a virtue about them
 for the july  cover is the only one i cant re-
 member in detail beginning with the very first
 date details title the plot and outstanding features
 of the story illustrated-i can give them all and
 they ought to draw trade whether they do or not
 as i said before the february  cover is 
 the very best by a good deal that should draw
 and not drive off buyers 

    lawlor is not so hot or maybe hes too hot
  his drawings certainly look as if they had been
  distorted by the heat then again he has done
  some really good pictures though on thewhole hes
  way below paul maybe i say that because my
  imagination isnt well enough trained at any rate

  i say it the best artist youve had yet speak-
  ing from the realistic point of view where men are
  men and not french dolls or wax scarecrows with a
  decided tendency to run is the man who illustrated
  leinsters the red dust way back in january
   and the first two parts of wells the first
  men in the moon in the same and preceding is-
  sues wbo was he and why hasnt there been more
  of him id really like to see more of his work
  if its consistently good paul can be such a
  pleasure and then such a shock

    about my brain let the poor artists have a
  chance after all it is for an artist to criticise an
  artist wc plcbes are or should be out of it
  literature is different wc have more of a chance
  there wells certainly doesnt need championing
  but he docs draw a lot of adverse comment from
  those who want a steady diet of wholesale ex-
  plosions and ten-hoursto-live-if-the-scicntist-doesnt-
  discover-a-new-element story wells and merritt arc
  reliefs the one with his wonderful insight into the
  public mind and the other with his gigantic imagin-
  ation their stories are mental setting-up exercises
  edmond hamilton is another of their kind and kay
  cummings burroughs is entertaining but his
  scicncc is a bit wobbly and he hasnt wit to go be
  yond science as merritt king of them all docs

    detective stories and short sketches like the
  way of a dinosaur are excellent there are more
  and better stories in these fields than youve ever
  published and plenty worse i devour both types
  eagerly incidentally it is interesting to note that
  the scientific detective leads in his field characters
  like dr thorndye craig kennedy and dr ilailley
  lead the hunt the latest dr thorndyke book con-
  tains a questionnaire on the points of scicnce illus-
  trated in his various stories

    still some people dont like them and they have
  as much right to their preference is  to mine i
  for one couldnt be satisfied with an issue made
  specially for me id want to sec if perhaps there
  werent something belter in the other fellows copy

    theres plenty more to say of coursc but i wont
  try to say it editors ore people after all whether
  they or we admit it or not and just now if youve
  reached this point youre probably cursing me

ahita mwtnote hi anita bmx newark n i

please say you saw it in amazing stories

   an astronomer is inspired by
   amazing stories to build his
   own reflecting telescope

  editor amazing storifs

    the discussions departmcnt of your very in-
  teresting magazine is always the part to which i
  turn first some of the letters have afforded me
  much thought as well as some amusement

    the many letters regarding the proposed scicnce
  club led me to believe that many of your readers
  would welcome an opportunity to make the ac-
  quaintance of some branch of scicnce so i would
  like to tell them how easily they can be introduced
  to the scicnce of astronomy

    some time ago i became interested in the science
  of the heavens from reading some of your astron-
  omical stories and purchased a small refracting
  telescope which only sufficed to show me enough
  of the wonders of the sky to whet my desire to
  know and sec more

    as astronomical telescopes are quite expensive
  no doubt some of your readers like myself will
  be willing to tackle the rather particular job of
  making a telescope it is not as difficult as one
  might think in fact i believe that any one wbo
  has the ability to construct a good radio set cavi
  build a telescope

    i purchased a book called amateur telescope
  making which explains in a very understandable
amazing stories



  way the fascinating art of grinding and figuring
  mirrors and lenses as it did not seem too diffi-
  cult i tackled the job of making a six-inch niew-
  tonian reflector and was pleasantly surprised by
  the results it gave when completed

    for a cost of less than  i have a telc-
  scopc that shows the rings of saturn the moons
  and belts of jupiter the phases of venus some
  of the surface markings of mars and nebulae
  double stars and other interesting objects too
  numerous to mention our moon alone is suffi-
  ciently beautiful and interesting to repay one for
  the labor of making a telcscopc

    the book cited will serve to introduce one to a
  very fascinating hobby even if one does not care
  to go into astronomy very deeply

    i am not connected in any way with the pub-
  lishers of amateur telcscopc making my only
  wish is to see others become interested in astronomy

    perhaps it is over-conscientiousness on our part
  but we sometimes feel as if we did not do enough
  on the scientific side of our field of work letting the
  literary part crowd out some of the scientific part
  but a letter like this goes to show how much good
  we really arc doing amazing stories has started
  a man into astronomy who has actually ground up
  a -inch mirror for a reflecting telescope this
  letter to our mind is an impressive tribute to
  amazing stories some interesting articles on
  the construction of astronomical telescopes lens
  grinding polishing and silvering with full illus-
  trations have been published in science and
  invention we give a few titles with references

    the february  issue of science and in-

the editorial an amazing phe-
nomenon

  editor amazing stories

    this is chiefly in reference to your editorial in
  the december issue of amazing stories entitled
  an amazing phenomenon i would criticize al-
  though mayhap without apparent justification

    i have been a reader of amazing stories since it
  was first introduced aud i have found your edi-
  torials almost uniformly to my liking and cer-
  tainly rich in that expression of intelligent insight
  that characterizes the thinking man but with this
  one i feel that i must find fault

    you offer what you call a theory that tends to
  explain the supposed facts of what is commonly
  known as premonition that it may appear fan-
  tastic is no ground for objection and as a basic
  working hypothesis it might le accepted subject to
  the derivation of a theory but havent you over-
  looked a few rather important details to enum-
  erate you illustrate by using an almost classical
  example of paramnesia the intricate structure of a
  brain cell might in the case of cannibals or were
  the deceased of our race used to fatten the pork
  -which we in turn consumed maintain something
  of its original structure but when one considers
  the transformations through which it must go be-
  fore it or any of its parts might enter into an-
  other human system it seems most incredible that
  it should still retain the memory impressions of
  five thousand years ago or of five months ago

    experiment with which i have been associated
  has tended to prove that although light and color
  sensations are tclepathically transmissible that form
  is not except possibly in those unusual cases of
  ideation or thought transference the very existence
  of which is not too well proven that would tend
  to weaken a telepathic explanation

    it has been my experience as it has been the ex-
  perience of most people to have had at one time or
  oftener that feeling of having observed a scene
  previously often enough this can be explained by
  lag in the perceptive speed in one of the hemis-
  pheres of the brain sometimes that is not so
  applicable in my own case i have generally been

    the editorial you refer to has certainly attracted
  our readers attention yours is the sccond letter
  we have published about it we referred in our
  comment on another letter to the subconscious
  self this has much to do with such things as
  spirit writing and the ouija hoard which in their
  manifestations arc due to nothing more occult than
  the same subconscious self wc have much to
  learn about all these phenomena which really in
  many cases elude our powers of explanation-

  editor amazing stories

    i have just finished reading the september issue
  of amazing stories and still maintain my record
  since the original first one through the short
  years while amazing stories has truly grown amaz-
  ingly it has been my one magazine pal north
  south east and west alike i first saw your mag-
  azine at a friends house in providence r i-
  then i was so hct up over this new and unrivalled 
  magazine that i got the next three numbers in
  rhode island and continued in connecticut the
  annual accompanied me from new haven conn to
  new orleans la-and then to houston texas
  issue after issue found me in various parts of the
  country-but they always found me or i found
  them once again in little rhody i got tbe
  september issue and here i am

    i have been called several uncomplimentary very
  names for lieing such a devoted reader but upon 
  insisting that they prove their point they usually
  say lets take a look at it anyway and then
  they get interested however reluctantly and the
  local newsdealer has to order a few more copies to
  meet the demand i am not going to ask a commis-
  sion for this campaign of mine but within two
  weeks iu one texas town i bad the local demand
  of amazing stories jump from  to 

    my mother was one of the severest critics in my-
  choice of uplifting literature but one night at the
  table i was telling a friend of mine about tbe
  comet doom and ten million miles sunward
  and the mrs prickcd up her ear and asked
  where i had gotten all that information trium-
  phantly i told her that it was obtained from no other
  source than that uplifting literature she scoffed
  at she aid shed have to start reading and she
  being a devoted reader of edgar rice burroughs
  i started her on the master mind of mars
  which in my opinion is about the best story ive
  ever read and ive read widely-that one sur-
  passes even burroughs former stories in book
  form of his martian creations and the phoenician-
  character of his john carter

    criticisms should come next and usually your
  critics start with no  and tear apart every piee
  of the magazine regardless of the hard work of the
  editors to please them but such is life personally

  i am not going to criticize for the very simple
  reason that i have no criticisms to make absolutely
  none

    if i may-i should like to add another wreath
  to the now swelling pile at the feet of mr paul
  your arlist mr paul is unusually adept at pic-
  turing the things as is-and that alone is a point
  many artists never attain

    i shall look forward to more of merritts stories
  and tell e r burroughs if he still survives to
  go to mars and get some more dope on the im-
  mortal john carter

  you have ccrtainly been unfailing in the in-
  terest you have shown in our amazing stories
  and such interest is most flattering you have given

  you have found the magazine this we do not
  publish but it is enough to tell our readers that it
  covers cities in a number of states from texas to
  rhode island you say you have no criticisms to
  make our own criticism on your letter is due to
  our modesty wc feel that you are really too mat-

flatlanders and the third dimen-
sion the three dimension man
and the fourth dimension

  editor amazing stories

  i have just re-read ob olsens great story the
   fourth-dimensional robberies and the more i
  think over the matter the more i am convinced j
  that it should be classed with dr mentiroso 
  while the puzzlement in the latter is from the
  man-made differences in time in the former it i
  merely a play on perspective

  another thing olsen says in demonstrating
  his jioint that if  flatlander of two dimensions
  would use a sjtecially constructed forceps it could
  extract an object from a three dimensional prison j
  in this case a rubber band now it stands to 
  reason that a latlauder could not use above the 
  two dimensions or even grasp the handles of a 
  three dimensional forceps to turn olsens reason- 
  ing against him how then could a three dimension
  person deal in the fourth dimension

  ill regards to the cubes the author says that
  taking two one-inch cules he moves one of them
  onc-inch into the fourth dimension so that it is
  inside of the other if it were not it would j
  coincide now has he really moved it into the
  fourth dimension no lie has merely condensed
  it into  smaller space and in reality made smaller 
  its three dimensions

  to cloe why should we take one more theory
  einsteins as being correct doubtless he had 
  a great intellect but stil he is human and to err
  is human docs it not seem that everything can
  e explained perfectly with only three dimensions

                    james phklak

              charles st edwardsvillc 

  we think that ierhaps it is a compliment to le j
  classed with dr mentiroso tor the titularily men- j
  dacious gentleman in question in spite of his 
  lack of veracity certainly made people think and 
  your letter shows that you have been giving con-
  siderate thought to the subject of the fourth di-
  mension as regards your last query everything
  cannot be explained with only three dimensions
  and we firmly believe that gravitation or the ether
  could not be explained with any number of dimen-
  sions einsteins laws arc not universally accepted
  by any means although some of the highest authori-
  ties have adopted him enthusiastically-editor

precognition dreams forecasting
the future

  editor amazing stories

  in his story unlocking the past dr david
  h keller in shaking about inherited memory
  has this to say as a hypothesis this is hard to
  prove all of us have exjericnccd the peculiar
  psychic sensation in reading a book that somewhere
  sometime we have read it before or we feel c
  have iertormed a certain act before or visited a
  certain shop in a european city when we know
  positively that this is our first trip across the
  atlantic when these sensations arc subjected
  to careful analysis they become difficult to evaluate
  aud can be put to no scientific proof

  the t explanation of the-e sensations or feel-
  imrs is in my opinion that given by j y dunne
  ii his lhik an experiment with time mr
  ihiniic claims that dreams-dreams in general all
  dreams everybodys dreams-are composed of irn-
  of pas experience and images of future cx-
  pvricncc blended together in approximately equal
  proportions lie shows how any one can verify
  this statement for himself mr dunne says hat
  hidden fleeting disturbing conviction that some-
  thing which is happening at that moment has hap-
  jned before has happened before--in a dream
  which eludes precise recollection

  no longer can precognition or premonition be
  denied as many scientific men do deny it deny
  not because it is not a fact but lecausc it docs
  not square with their preconceive  ideas perhaps
  scieucc doesnt know it but precognition is a
  challenge to its theories precognition being a fact
  science roust change many t its theories

                              wm crocker
  prescott ariz
  we do not believe for a moment that dreams
  can foretell the future and we would suggest that
  you take up the subject with the editors of science
  axn invention dreams are now attributed to the
  recollection conscious or subconscious of things
  that iiave happened in the past we certainly have
  no hesitation in denying precognition and premoni-
  tion except as far as they may be indicated by
  experience of the past giving a guess at what
  course one may pursue in the immediate future
  a very few years ago everyone would have pro-
  nounced wireless in this present development as
  impossible and any conception of it corresponding
  to what has been done and what is being done
  every day as ridiculous this also applies to
  television but do not believe in precognition
  premonition is attributable to a guess based on
  experience-editok

houdini was deeply interested in spiritualism
he spent years in the study of this fascinating
subject when he had fully mastered every
angle he turned his attention to exposing the fraudu-
lent practices of mediums mysterious voices in the
air unearthly tappings on the tahle weirdly moving
furniture floating figures hands lights-every trick
employed by mediums in order to make their seances

more realistic houdini was able to explain and dupli-
cate by perfectly natural means

with his death the work of exposing ths practices of
spiritualistic mediums slackened in a very noticeable
degree in consequence mediums each day have grown
bolder until now the voice of houdini as if called from
the grave has returned and can be heard to echo
throughout the pages of this amazing book hou-
dinis spirit exposes here houdini lives
again to crush the swelling number of mediums para-
sitical bleeding their victims of their most cherished
possessions while posing in the guise of the living dead

all should read this tremendously interesting book the en-
tire treatise has been written from the personal notes of h-
dini-a startling expose on one of the biggest frands of tbe
day do not fail to get jour copy- pages-fully illustrated
