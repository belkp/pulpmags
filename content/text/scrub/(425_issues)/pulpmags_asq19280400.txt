the rise of scientifiction

by hugo gernsback

 since amazing stories and its sister maga-
 zines amazing stories annual and
 amazing stories quarterly camc into being
 a great change has taken place in scientifiction
 literature when the magazine was first
 launched we had no original manuscripts at
 all little by little as the magazine continued
 to grow original scientifiction manuscripts began
 to arrive and it became possible to have less and
 less reprints the initial issue of amazing
 stories contained  reprints that is stories
 all of which had been published before the
 tendency now however is distinctly the other
 way in the current issues of amazing stories
 the only reprints published are some of the stories
 of the jules verne and h g wells type for
 which there seems to be a constant demand by the
 many readers who have not seen these classics
 before

   when we brought out the year book last
 summer we featured only one original story
 the master mind of mars by edgar rice
 burroughs all other stories were reprints the
 first quarterly three months ago contained
 only one reprint-h g wells famous story
 when the sleeper wakes all other stories
 were original

   and now the second issue of the quarterly
 contain  new stories all of them original
 this again is an experiment in the first place
 because until very recently there were not
 enough new scientifiction stories to go around

 and secondly because the few that were sub-
 mitted were not always good enough to publish

    but times are rapidly changing scientifiction
 may now be said to have arrived with a bang
 more and more authors of the better kind are
 taking to scientifiction as the proverbial duck
 takes to water it is a great source of satisfaction
 to us and we point to it with pride that 
 of the really good scientifiction authors are
 americans the rest being scattered over the
 world wc believe that america will in time
 become known as the hotbed of scientifiction and
 that more excellent scientifiction will be turned
 out in this country than anywhere else already
 in our editorial opinion our modern authors have
 far eclipsed both jules verne and h g wells
 we know that is a broad statement and one
 of vast import but it is true nevertheless it
 takes time for a new art to develop and while
 we are not as yet at the top we arc slowly get-
 ting there certainly and the movement of sci-
 entifiction will sooner or later assume proportions
 far exceeding the expectations of most of us

    just as there are cycles in style there are cy-
 cles in literature during the last few decades
 for instance there were cycles of the expose
 story then we had the boys detective cycle next
 the real detective stories more recently the sex
 story and still more recently the self confession
 story these are only the outstanding distinct
 types of course there are many others but the
 scientifiction cycle is now in its ascendancy and
 is growing rapidly

the next issue of the quarterly will be on the
newsstands july th

 prologue

on a certain winters night in  a small group
of men chatted comfortably about an open fire
in the great room of the harvard club in new
york city they had been classmates a few years
before when the imperial german government elected
to dictate to the sovereign people of these united
states as to when where and under what conditions
ships might sail on the high seas without being
sent to davy jones locker by german submarines in
the days that had followed had come the dissolution
of ties-family social and fraternal among those
now reassembled this narrative is concerned only
with two

   bob holden tall slender
and dynamic in personality
and action had placed at
the service of his govern-
ment during those trying
times a well balanced sci-
entific mind destined to
brilliant achievements in
the field of aeronautics

much valuable data con-
tributed by him now lies
buried in the sepulchres of
the extensive government
graveyards in washing-
ton some day his mono-
graphs may be found red
penciled with the com-
ments and vetoes of a corps
of efficiency experts the
just reward of whose
merits lies in the fact that
they have been entirely
forgotten in the era of post
war progress

  jerry scott soldier of
fortune gentleman vaga-
bond artist and rover had
served overseas in a var-
iety of capacities his war
posters were much sought
in england france and
america to stimulate and
encourage the various
branches of service he
played and sang his way
into the hearts of the
doughboys and organized
amateur theatricals and
minstrel shows to reinspire flagging spirits his unfail-
ing optimism and contagious flow of good spirits made
him a great favourite with both officers and men and led
to many special details where the morale of the troops
needed stimulation thus he substituted at first aid
stations on the fighting front when doctors were
scarce had an ambulance blown from under him by a
shell near verdun captured six germans in one day
in the argonne and after the armistice went blithely
jon an extended tour to little known corners of the
world finally turning up in new york after a lapse
of some two years

  on the night in question the conversation had
drifted to the limitation of armaments conference
then in session in washington some one ventured
the opinion that secretary hughes was playing a
foxy hand-he knew from the results of recent naval
tests of bombing planes that battleships were things
of the past holden remarked that it would be only
a matter of a few years before airplanes in war
would likewise become obsolete another member of
the group had opened his mouth to question holdens
reasons for such a statement when jerry scott who
had been rummaging through a newspaper suddenly

jumped up with

  good god did you see
this bob fellows did you
read this thing about jack
rutherford we were pals
in france went through
hell together you all re-
member jack you know
he wouldnt do a thing like
that in his right mind i
tell you he couldnt
well what is it said
ilolden what has jack
done

  jerry scott was still
clutching the paper waving
it excitedly why of all
the vile things he deserted
her - the woman who
saved his life-was about
to marry another church
wedding and all that when
his wife appears at the al-
tar tells her story and ex-
hibits their marriage cer-
tificate and there was a
marriage fellows i was
with them when they were
married in paris now
jack doesnt even remem-
ber her-amnesia due to
shell shock his folks say
scott dropped into a
chair and continued remi-
niscently kathleen riley
was her name a bewitch-
ing irish lass-fathomless
blue eyes and hair black as
ravens wing you know
the type and true as steel father was a noted exponent
of irish freedom-got implicated some way with sir
roger casement smuggling arms into ireland case
against him wasnt very clear but he was convicted on
circumstantial evidence under plotting against the
realm act feeling ran high at that time and he was
executed that made her hate england so she got across
to the german lines somehow and went in for nursing
just wanted to lose her own trouble by doing her bit
to relieve the suffering of others her mother had died
when she was a baby and she was educated in a
french convent afterwards became a great pal

 t has been said with a good deal of
    justification that the average sc-ienti-
    fiction story is just what its name implies
    i e science and fiction jules verne for
    instance wrote good science in his fiction
    but there was little literature contained in
    it the same may be said of many others

      --xhe present story however is a scienti-
      fiction classic that will gain in importance
      as years go by yet fantastic as the story
      seems it is all based upon absolute fact

        the invention of the isleports was made
      some years ago by edio r armstrong an
      engineer of wilmington del he actually
      built a number of models and it was be-

 lieved that the isleport would make an
     ideal base in the middle of the atlantic
     the models demonstrated that a model ship
     alongside would pitch and toss whereas the
     isleport would stand as steady as a rock in
     the midst of the heavy seas photographs
     of the models have been reproduced in the
     text of this story for the sake of complete-
     ness and lest you think that the deadly
     ray which the author shows so vividly is a
     matter of pure fiction-no doubt it was
     fiction when mr hodge wrote the story-
     read the may issue of radio news maga-
     zine in which an account of these new rays
     will be found it is true that the rays are
     still only in the laboratory but you may be
     sure that within a very few years they will
     be used for practical purposes and then we
     will witness scenes not unlike those de-
     scribed by the author


guests arriving ot tho isleport by airplane alighted on a vast level field which constituted the upper landing deck from this feck they
were conducted down a long inclined ramp to the fourth deck here they entered the hotel at the seventh hoor and descended by elevator
to the third floor and so on to tho different decks the lower deck was used for engineering purposes    there was  splendidi mu couree
tennis courts a palm garden etc on the various levels  the light between the decks was excellent and uniform owing to tho fact that

for her dad and they traveled about together all over
europe spoke half a dozen european tongues like
the natives and had lived in vienna prague berlin
berne and all over italy and france couldnt have
been over nineteen when the war closed it seemed as
though she had lived a century she was still a flower
in the bud she had laughing eyes always challenging
to a frolic and the type of spirit that can never
die

  you see i met her the same day jack rutherford
met her it was in the argonne august  when
we were just getting fairly started on the final drive
there was a small french village that was taken and
retaken several times the same day we drove em
into the village and they rallied dont make any
mistake about it those heinies were fighting about
that time machine guns were rat-a-tating from every
window and from behind every wall and we beat
it back for reinforcements then i missed jack
well our artillery laid down a barrage and we went
at em again just as we made the rise in front
of the village i stumbled and half fell into a shell
hole it was big as a house and as i looked across
the chasm i saw her she had just come out to give
first aid to a wounded doughboy in the hole and a
long-armed gorilla type austrian officer was pulling
her back to cover she resisted and tried to wench
free from his grasp it took a moment for me to
get the situation clear then i saw the austrian whip
out a revolver and his arm-swung out and down for
a pot shot at the yank thatmsde me mad clean
through it was the sort of thing that hadnt been
done since early in the war and just then she knocked
his hand up he struck her with his clenched fist
and i fired

  it had all taken place in an instant but each sep-
arate movement was etched into my mind like a series
of motion pictures flashed on a screen and i was
crossing the big hole to find jack rutherford his
head supported on the arm of the nurse drinking from
her flask the austrian with blood streaming from
his jaw escaped into the doorway of a house on the
upper edge of the hole

  scott passed his hand over his eyes as if to erase
the scene from his brain and then resumed well
god only knows how she got him back behind our
lines for i had to leave them there and go on with
the rest of the boys couldnt stop to help a wounded
pal you know that was orders but that nurse was

as cool and self-possessed as if she were sitting on a
bench in central park

  we were driven out of the village half an hour
later when the heinies laid down a barrage that re-
duced it to gravel but they were gone when i passed
the hole on the way back i didnt see them again
until after the armistice it was then that she told
me about her life it seems that she had foreseen the
end of the war and wanted to get away from that
austrian who had been pestering her with his atten-
tions and wanted to marry her jack had been plugged
in the arm and leg she had nursed him through
fever and shell-shock and when i ran across them in
paris he was coming round to the old jack ruther-
ford again except for occasional fainting spells and
some queer lapses of memory at times i was with
them when they were married then i slipped away-
gave her my best pal and went down to the land
where king tut once ruled to try and forgot the
triumphs that civilization had brought to the world
jack was going to return home leaving her to
straighten out some matters concerning her fathers
estate he wanted to break the news to his people
rather gently for he knew that they had other plans
for him he expected to return for her in a few
months

  its only one little incident in the aftermath of war
but i never could forget that little irish nurse risk-
ing her life to save one from the camp of the enemy
in the name of humanity boys what a picture i
once tried to paint her fighting with that beast over
the broken body of jack rutherford-american dough-
boy but gentlemen there never was a sable that
grew hair fine enough to put the humanity into the
eyes of the woman who saved jacks life and for
what purpose now for what

  no one had ever seen jerry scott so moved and
there was silence and a lump in the throat of his
comrades for a time after he had finished hi story
finally bob holden broke the spell

  jerry has painted his picture he said simply and
it will live with all of us to such a woman no man
could ever give the half of the happiness that she de-
serves but war is a destroyer whose toll is not to
be numbered by its casualties in honor of this
woman who has given so much i pledge myself and
whatever i can do to the abolition of war

  standing with uplifted glasses the little group re-
peated as one man

  to the abolition of war

chapter i
the fate of an incognito

eptember sun was some two hours
the western horizon one afternoon
e early nineteen thirties when out
its red hazed disk there floated a
aerobird with steadily increasing re-
verberations which broke in upon the stillness of the
autumn air like the roll of a machine gun approach-
ing its mid-ocean destination the staccato from its ex-
hausts was diminished as the pilot successively cut
out eight of its ten powerful motors then as it de-
scended in a sweeping curve the last two were silenced
and it glided gracefully as some super-gull to its rest-
ing place on top of what might have appeared to be
another species of the same genus only infinitely
greater in size

had it been possible for one to stand at a dis-

tance on that waste of waters the spectacle might
easily have translated itself into the illusion of a
chick hopping to the back of its mother as she dozed
in the quiet of her afternoon siesta

  an observer at closer range mingling in the throng
which like the inhabitants of some remote village
had gathered on the landing deck of isleport number
two to witness the arrival of the daily mail might
have noticed among the seventy or more passengers
who disembarked for a few moments to stretch their
tired muscles while the plane was being refueled
a man of more than medium height accompanied by
a woman wrapped in a fur coat slipping quietly and
unobtrusively through the crowd threading their
passage to the outskirts of the assembly the man led
the way with the directness of familiarity to a ramp
at the edge of the landing deck down the ramp and
through a garden of such semi-tropical luxuriance as
to remind one of some sequestered haven of the an-
a modern atlantis



tilles their course soon brought them to a building
centrally located in the ensemble an outer door
facing upon the garden was opened with a pass key
and the two proceeded through a passage up a flight
of stairs then through another door similarly opened
and into a spacious room answering to the require-
ments of library and general lounging room

  bob holden for such was the designation of the
tall traveler was one of those few geniuses who live
to see their visions materialize isleport number two
was one of a system of mid-ocean roadsteads now
moored in the atlantic wastes and offering the mul-
tifold advantages of hotel country-club ocean liner
and marine and airplane base there were in all
four such isleports three on direct line be-
tween new york and the azores and one
between the latter and london isleport
number one in the gulf
stream was a popular week-
end resort for jaded gotham-
ites and number four sup-
plied a similar rendezvous for
the elite of the
worlds metropolis

ample transporta-
tion facilities were
provided by the
trans-atlantic air-

plane service inc which ran a daily line of planes
making the crossing between the hemispheres in ap-
proximately the same time as that required by the
earth for a single revolution about its axis addi-
tional passenger service was furnished between the
metropolises and their nearest isleports by means of
local planes on a schedule adapted to meet the re-
quirements of the season

threading their passage to the outskirts of the assembly the man led
the way with the directness of familiarity to a ramp at the edge of
the landing deck down the ramp and through a garden of semi-
tropical luxuriance

   the apartment which holden and his traveling com-
 panion now entered comprised a wing of the upper
 floor of the hotel it had been designed and equipped
 for his personal requirements and offered a quiet
 retreat for rest and study far removed from the dis-
 tractions which since the materialization of his chi-
 merical fantasy had made life ashore a burdensome
 round of business and social engagements although
 featured in magazine and newspaper articles as the
 wizard who had united the hemispheres there were
 few indeed who could boast of his personal acquaint-
 ance fewer still of his friendship he had entered
 the lime-light of his brilliant career a man of mystery
 and was rapidly becoming a recluse but on the isle-
 port he was a natural free man unknown save to the
 manager who was under strict orders to preserve
 under all circumstances the incognito of his illustrious
 guest

   thus it often happened as on the present occa-
 sion that holden arrived on the isleport without even
 the manager being aware of his presence occa-
 sionally he was accompanied by one or two guests
 college friends of former years or men well known


amazing stories quarterly

in the annals of science but for the most part he
loved to come alomj in order that he might be better
able to concentrate on some of the baffling problems
ever present to men of broad vision and mental re-
source

  the apartment provided in addition to the library
three sleeping rooms a kitchenette and pantry which
was kept well stocked with provisions replaced every
week thus he was enabled to slip quietly into the
privacy of home life or if he preferred he could have
his meals supplied in his own apartment through the
chief steward or in the more public dininrt rooms of
the hotel life on the isleport therefore offered him
the greatest range of freedom and the opportunity
to pursue any course of study or recreation to which
he felt inclined

to account for the presence on this occasion of his
female traveling companion it is necessary to go
back into the more recent years of holdens life
at the time of the events herein set forth he was a
man in his early forties possessing a well-built athletic
figure despite his height he moved with a freedom
which just fell short of smoothness because of a cer-
tain decisiveness and alertness which made his actions
unexpected and therefore lacking in that finish
commonly accorded to graceful movement in his
earlier career at college he had taken an active part
in the lighter forms of athletics such as fencing and
track and then with the advent of war had plunged
suddenly into arduous indoor laboursover the draught-
ing board and in the laboratory with long hours of
the most exacting mental drudgery and mathematical
calculations where a single slip might have meant the
loss of many lives and the war had exacted its
toll even as it did over millions of those who never
saw the fighting front the close of the war left
him tired and worn but the restlessness of the post
war period had seized him and he did not pause or
relax the vision of the floating isleports had firmly
implanted itself in the fructifying soil of his mind
and his labours increased now with the materializa-
tion of the dream to which he had set himself and
which he had carried on by sheer force of will there
had come the warnings of a recalcitrant heart occa-
sional fainting spells general lassitude and physical
inability to keep the pace that his ever active mind
demanded immediately he had placed himself under
the care of a specialist the trouble had not become
organic and might under proper care and treatment
over an extended period entirely disappear it was
therefore by the orders of his physician one dr
von sturm that he had accepted the constant attend-
ance of the trained nurse which the doctor procured
for him and it was she who accompanied him on
his present sojourn

  dr von sturm a man of international reputation
in the treatment of cardiac diseases had realized
that the selection of a nurse for bob holden was a
matter requiring unusual consideration he had studied
holdens eccentricities carefully and knew that his
selection must be a woman who would combine un-
usual proficiency in her profession with qualities of
mind which would whenever required place her on a
plane of companionship with the scientist she must
moreover be a lover of nature and outdoor life and
something more than a dub at golf the only game
in which holden was allowed to participate in
searching through his files he came across the record
of one kitty cromwell with copious notes on her
character life and the ability she had displayed in
the handling of several cases she had been used by
him on a number of occasions where linguistic attain-

ments had been an important factor for the doctor
had a large foreign clientele he sent for her and
after an hours conversation presented to her the de-
tails of the case she was familiar with the news-
paper accounts of holden and his floating isleports
and was at once interested in the prospect of a posi-
tion which in addition to its peculiar character offered
unusually large lucrative inducements

  kitty cromwell had been in holdens employ only
a few months and this was her first trip to the en-
chanted isles about which she had read and heard
so much the trip on the giant aircraft which had
carried them steadier than an ocean liner and swifter
than a bird in flight had been filled with excitement
and interest but upon their arrival in holdens apart-
ment she succumbed to the feeling of restful languor
that seemed a part of the place holden showed un-
mistakable signs of fatigue so she suppressed her de-
sire to explore the isleport-there would be days pos-
sibly weeks for that delightful occupation-and set
herself about the work of making the place comfortable
for her patient and herself

  the discovery of the well stocked larder coupled
with the quiet homelike atmosphere of the surround-
ings quickly led to the decision to prepare the eve-
ning meal herself rather than requisition the services
of the hotel chef as holden had suggested and she
was soon busily engaged in the arts which are rapidly
being relegated to the age of the unemancipated fe-
male

  the meal was soon served in the library and seldom
had holden enjoyed a meal at once so simple and so
wholesome the long voyage through the early autumn
air had whetted their appetites and they ate with
that freedom of appreciation which distinguishes keen
relish from aesthetic insouciance as the last glow of
the setting sun flooded the room then quickly faded
into the short autumn twilight holden switched on
the light and sinking into his easy chair lighted his
pipe and picked up a late magazine in a short time
miss cromwell too sat down with a book she had
selected from the shelves and listlessly perused the
pages but her mind drifted away on the currents and
counter-currents of life that had shaped her course
into this haven of rest and peace from far below
there came to them the rythmic swish and rush of
the rollers breaking through the bridge-work of the
structure and this constant repetition at regular inter-
vals relaxed the tension of tired nerves until the
great outer world seemed to recede leaving behind a
feeling of isolation-a sense of being carried along on
some wave of destiny out into the great adventurous
unknown

neither one felt under necessity to make conver-
sation for during the few months of their as-
sociation there had come about a mutual feeling of
freedom from the constraint which too often blights
companionship with the chit-chat of enforced conversa-
tion but holden finally looked up from an article he
had been reading on our european relations and
more to himself than to her he said

  this european turmoil seems to grow apace no
telling where it will end if our country continues her
demand for payment of war loans it may mean the
eventual bankruptcy of many european countries we
build a tariff wall around american industries to
keep out european competition and in so doing cut
off one of their chief sources of revenue they look
upon us as a grasping creditor who like shylock
would extract the pound of flesh a number of euro-
pean countries have banded themselves together in an
industrial boycott of all goods from the united
a modern atlantis



states to add seriousness to the situation immense
sums of money which our country claims should be
used in payment of europes debts to us are being
expended in the interests of european military pre-
paredness and their development and production of
airplanes has grown beyond all measure of industrial
necessity all wars of the past have had their roots in
economic causes and the present situation is to say
the least pregnant with alarming possibilities but
still the united states sleeps confident in her security
as the worlds banker the law often contributes to
the making of thieves and murderers and we should
not loose sight of the fact that a successful blow
struck by our debtors would absolve them from their
present obligations and at the same time place our
immense wealth at their disposal

  in case of trouble between europe and the united
states what about these isleports she asked an
air fleet such as europe could mobilize could easily
seize them and make them a base for operations
against america

  such an emergency has been provided for orders
have been given to the resident engineer on each of
the isleports that in case of a declaration or any act
of war against the united states the sea-cocks are
to be opened and the isleports sunk you may know
or perhaps you dont that these isleports are floated
on long necked steel bottles the bodies of these
bottles are deep down in the ocean below the level
of surface disturbances waves affect the water under
the surface less and less as the depth is greater at a
sufficient depth there is no effect this keeps the
isleports to use a sailors term on even keel and pre-
vents their being tossed about on the waves like ships
this isleport rests upon the necks of ten thousand
of these steel bottles and the lower deck is a hundred
and fifty feet above the bodies of the bottles inas-
much as the highest waves known in the atlantic are
about forty feet high no storm however violent can
disturb the equilibrium of the decks the bottles and
their necks are bridged and stayed together in such a
manner as to defy the shocks due to wind and wave

  in the bottom of each bottle is what is known as
a seacock which acts much like the stopper to an
ordinary bottle except that in this case the stopper
is inside of the bottle each bottle is partly filled with
sea-water and above the water with air under pres-
sure the air is forced in by means of a series of
large compressors the bottle necks are connected on
the lower deck level into pipe lines running to the
compressors in these pipe lines each of which con-
nects a group of the bottles are air valves by means
of which the air can be let out the air valves and the
sea-cocks are opened or closed by motors to lower
the isleport it is only necessary to open both the
air-valves and the sea-cocks as the water enters the
bottles through the sea-cocks the air is forced out
through the valves it would take seven or eight hours
to sink this isleport as it will float with only one
third of the bottles in use to raise the isleport
higher out of the water the sea-cocks are likewise
opened but the air-valves are closed and the com-
pressors are used to pump more air into the bottles
forcing the water out through the sea-cocks

  but how she queried are the isleports held in the
same location the ocean must be very deep here
too deep to anchor them by any ordinary means then
too the size of the isleport is such that the pull on an
anchor would be almost certain to shift it

  that is a matter he replied which occasioned
some months of engineering work and presented great
difficulties it finally resulted however in anchoring
each isleport by means of three cables each of these

cables is approximately three times as long as the
ocean is deep and is of such size that alone it will
withstand the total pull of the isleport the anchor
is shaped like a clamshell and lies on the bottom of
the ocean in such a manner that the edge of the shell
sinks into the mud the anchors are so positioned
that the cables attached to them converge on a centra
point near to this center the cables rise from the
ocean bed to a floating buoy of a size sufficient to
carry the combined weight of the cables this buoy
is attached by a short cable to the center of the long
side of the isleport the buoy prevents the weight of
the cables from dragging down on the side of the isle-
port and careening the structure and also allows it to
swing in such a manner as to always bring the long
side to face the wind

  why the long side she asked it would seem bet-
ter to have the short side facing the wind

  that is due to certain requirements of our power
equipment which i will show you later moreover the
hotel runs transversely across the isleport and presents
its longest side toward the ends of the isleport the
resistance from either side is therefore approximately
equal the pull of the structure on the cables may
either be all on one cable or may be distributed on
any two of them depending on the direction of the
wind as the isleport pulls on these cables they are
lifted from the ocean bed in a curved line but in
any case there will be some miles of cable lying down
in the mud of the bottom this makes the pull on
the anchor horizontal and in order to shift it several
miles of cable would have to be pulled with it

  but she hazarded wars do not come over night
and foreseeing such an event the isleports might be
towed back to america and saved the destruction of
such a wonderful work should be resorted to only as
an absolute necessity

he shook his head slowly as he said no i fear
that there is no such assurance the next war
will come practically unheralded it is even possible
that actual hostilities may precede any formal declar-
ation of intentions japan did not declare war against
russia-she struck first germany overrode all peace
overtures by starting her march through belgium
moreover it would take months to tow such an un-
wieldly craft to our shores without injury it took
eight weeks to anchor this one in its present position
even though the flow of the gulf stream was in our
favor no war is war and by its very nature it is
a destroyer but much as i would hate to have them
sunk it would be far better than to have them fall
into the hands of an enemy who would use them as a
means of attacking our country

  it seems incredible she replied that nations
would again plunge the world into war will they
never learn that war is no solution of their problems
that it is a test of might and not of right and that
in the long run industrial and not military supremacy
is the real indicator of a nations might why must the
justness of a cause be forever dependent upon the
power to kill have you men of science no panacea
to offer

  i am convinced that the only thing that will bring
an end to wars is the discovery of some super-power
of destruction which will be held in secret by a na-
tion or an individual and used only to checkmate any
warlike disposition a single man he continued may
at some not far distant day hold the fate of the
world in his hands this may come about in any one
of a number of ways a new metal as light as
aluminum yet with a tensile strength many times that
of steel would make it possible to armour airships as


amazing stories quarterly

we now do naval vessels and equip them with long
range guns a means of sending electric power through
the air as we now send radio waves and yet concen-
trate such power in any given direction the discovery
of a new ray that will counter-act cohesion in matter
or the harnessing of atomic energy any one of these
might make war impossible it would be fortunate for
the world if such a discovery came to one who would
use it in the interests of world peace it would be dis-
astrous were it to be used for selfish ends or national
aggrandizement

   during the few months of their acquaintance she
had never heard him talk so freely she had had a
glimpse of the real man that lay concealed beneath the
cold and exact scientist and the view was humanized
and drew her to him she was deeply interested in
this new aspect of one whom the world denoted as a
man of mystery and she knew now that the world had
never known him he was a scientist but beneath
it all he was a man-one who would use his brilliant
mind for the betterment of humanity the question
as to whether he might be working toward some one
of the ends he had indicated came half formed into her
mind but she gave it no utterance

   the silence that had followed his last remarks was
broken only by the low muffled swish-swish of the
waves breaking through the steel structure and now
and then when an outer door was opened in the hotel
below a momentary strain of music floated up to
them from the orchestra in the dancing hall

   holden mused talking in low tones as if half to him-
self his train of thought taking its cue partly from
the thought he had last expressed and partly from the
sound of the waves in the ocean below funny thing
waves-the hallmark of universal energy-always in
motion that old greek knew a thing or two when he
postulated motion as the essence of all being ocean
waves atmospheric waves ether waves even the atoms
in steel vibrating rythmically we humans with our
puny sense organs catch a few of them and think that
we know the universe they impact upon our sense
organs and those coming at a rate of from thirty to
ten thousand per second set up vibrations in the ear
we hear these and call the waves sound waves when
they come at the rate of two hundred and fifty-six
per second we name that sound middle c on the
musical scale down in the ocean the fish are equipped
with an organ for interpreting wave velocities far be-
low our range of hearing what is their interpreta-
tion not sound nor color but something pleasant
vhen it sends them in pursuit of food and unpleasant
when they are pursued probably if the fish thinks at
all he believes that he knows the world through his
sense impressions yet fish have no sense organs for
the interpretation of atmospheric waves and our own
ability to receive and interpret ether waves is but
little in advance of that of the fish when one con-
siders the immense range of wave velocities which we
have no sense organ to interpret thus waves from
ten thousand to three hundred million millions per
second are all lost to us from that point to seven
hundred million millions is the range of heat and light
waves above that again is the ultra violet range
which is beyond the reach of any of our sense organs
though we had a hundred times our five senses with
which mankind is usually accredited we would still not
know our universe sir john lubbock that brilliant
student of ants bees and wasps demonstrated by more
than a hundred tests that ants see ultra-violet rays
which are beyond our range of vision back in the
early ages of the human race the range of color
vision was much more limited than it is at present
it was william e gladstone who although a noted

opponent of evolution first broached the idea that the
greeks of homers day did not see the higher colors
of the spectrum such as green blue and violet the
sky for them was steel gray and they had no words
in their language for green or blue moreover in re-
cent years certain races in the phillipines have been
found who have no perception for these higher colors
such colors being seen only as shades of gray or in
the black and white tones of a photograph the race
has at least doubled its range of color vision during
the period of written history and we may even look
forward to the time when we shall have advanced to
the ant stage but in any case there will always be
an infinite range of waves beyond our ken

   he reached to the table touched a button and slowly
 turned a dial and through the room there floated
 music from an orchestra in boston waves he con-
 tinued just waves harmonized in a hall in boston
 then raised into the range between sound and sight
 where there is no sense organ that can interpret
 them these shorter waves travel faster and farther
 and are finally transferred back into the range of
 hearing by this receiver

   the interpretation and control of ether waves is
the key to utopia and we are standing on fhe thresh-
hold some day the door will be opened some one will
find the key that will unlock it and in that day the
science that now is will appear to us as the child who
builds his world from a sand pile and a few blocks
of wood

  kitty cromwell knew that a prophet had spoken
yet it all seemed so simple so easy to understand his
sureness of himself and of the matters about which
he talked carried conviction they were not the un-
tried hypotheses of a fanatical dreamer but the simple
facts of scientific achievement reaching out its hand
into the future a philosophy that would germinate
into scientific activity and endow the world with its
fruits intuitively she felt that the trend of his
present investigation and experiments the work which
he had come here to complete was in an intricate way
connected with the two leading thoughts of his discus-
sion war and ether waves she recalled his words

   i am convinced that the only thing that will bring
an end to war is the discovery of some super-power
of destruction which will be held in secret by a na-
tion or an individual and used only to checkmate any
warlike disposition

   as she arose and bade him good night there came
to her the desire to express her new found faith in
him and the work to which she now felt certain he
had committed himself and to pledge to him her own
support and help but then there came the realization
that he had no need for such poor help as she could
offer he was self sufficient for any work he had
planned

   holden sat smoking his pipe for a long time after
she had gone it was seldom that he had found any-
one to whom he could express himself so freely and it
was always a satisfaction to him when he could talk
about the broader aspects of his work for it is a
paramount necessity to one engrossed in the develop-
ment of any important project that the basic prin-
ciples shall not be lost to view in the maze of details
and the general truths he had just reviewed found
their clearest expression in conversation with an ap-
preciative listener finally he rose from his chair
and went to his room

   both were fatigued by their long trip and under the
 spell of the ocean and the song of the waves were
 soon lost in sleep but neither dreamed of the mes-
 sages which while they slept were flying through the
a modern atlantis

s

ether nor of the mysterious adventures upon which
they had already embarked

chapter ii

the enchanted isle

there is abundant evidence that in the dim and
distant prehistoric ages the contours of the
eastern and western hemispheres differed widely
from those of modern times the discussion of these
important geographical differences however must be
left to those modern savants who while differing as
to the details have arrived at a fairly uniform con-
sensus of opinion respecting some of the greater
changes involved thus it is fairly well established
that in those remote times before man had become an
upright animal physically speaking the continent of
europe extended westward to a line known as the at-
lantic shelf many miles to the west of the present
coast lines of ireland and spain the british isles were
at that time a part of continental europe the eng-
lish channel would have presented no such challenge
to the daring and endurance of swimmers as at the
present day for its bed was a beautiful valley through
which the seine and the thames flowed westward to
the ocean the mediterranean was a system of two
inland seas separated by the isthmus the northern
part of which is now known as italy which united the
northern coast of africa with the southern part of
europe

  whence the legend of atlantis originated is un-
known for legend is as old as language itself while
its fair daughter history is a twin to the graphic
art but long before the first crude ideographs were
cut on wood bark or chiselled in stone the great con-
tinental changes that made britain an island and
caused the mediterranean to flow westward through the
pillars of hercules into the atlantic had taken place
the human race was cradled in the east but its
march wes ever westward westward lay the unknown
and to minds impregnated with the raw materials of
imagination the unknown was the land of golden op-
portunity as the centuries rolled on this westward
migration fringed the shores of the mediterranean
and spread north and south along the western coasts
of europe and it was but natural to this hardy race
of adventurers that as they gathered about their
campfires in cave and hut the thought that the sea
which beat upon their own rocky coasts must likewise
wash the gravelly beach of an opposite shore became
the subject of their conversation and their dreams

  the legend of atlantis was first recorded by plato
who had received it from certain egyptian priests
according to these priests atlantis was a continent of
considerable size many days voyage to the west of
the pillars of hercules ten thousand years before
the christian era it had been a powerful kingdom
and its armies had overrun the lands which bordered
the mediterranean it is not surprising therefore that
in the minds of ancient mariners the westward ocean
cradled a utopia which offered to them the fulfillment
of their wildest dreams of adventure or avarice this
fabled land offered all that the heart could desire its
climate was warmed by favoring breezes and warm
ocean currents its rich vegetation supplied food in
plenty without the necessity of cultivation its waters
flowed in crystal clear streams which defied the rav-
ages of age and made sickness a thing unknown and
its inhabitants were adorned with pearls of a size and
opalescence exceeding any ever seen

  this idea like those of paradise heaven nirvana
or the elysian fields may have been nurtured by the
desire that has ever animated the mind of man with

the hope of perfection here or hereafter but what-
ever its source certain it is that the idea was the
mainspring of many voyages of discovery and we
may not be too certain that the adventurous spirits
of columbus and vespucci were not more concentrated
in the hope of discovery of the lost atlantis than by
the more mercantile pursuit of a shorter passage to
india nor has this ancient conceit lost any of its
allurement before the modern advances of science for
ever and anon this legendary lost continent becomes
directly or indirectly the object of oceanographic re-
search countless expeditions have made its discovery
their objective and have for the most part become en-
tangled in that great floating mass of seaweed thrown
centripetally inward by the north atlantic eddy and
known as the sargasso sea

  on that september afternoon in which the events of
this story begin isleport number two might well have
been that fabled atlantis which attracted the ancient
mind with its illusions of an earthly paradise as its
waving palms and emerald-hued verdure caught the
glint of the rays from the setting sun and flung them
back glowing with golden green to form a jeweled
mosaic against the background of ocean blue which
was broken into lines and facets by white feather
tipped runners

structurally the isleport might have been
likened to a gigantic airplane a quintoplane with
wings more than half a mile in length but the
similarity was only in ita structural outline for in
place of the fuselage was an eight story hotel and
the wings instead of being designed to lift and sus-
tain a plane in flight were in reality five great decks
which converted the isleport into a country club with
some four hundred acres of grounds offering un-
parelleled facilities for recreation these great wings
or decks were covered with soil from one to four feet
in depth in which grew trees shrubbery and flowers
and over its undulating surface was a velvety carpet
of grass offering many enticing banks for repose
gravel walks wound in and out amidst the semi-tropi-
cal shrubbery while canaries mocking birds parrots
macaws and a variety of bright plumaged birds flitted
about freely among the branches of the trees content
to remain in the unmolested security of this island
paradise

  in nautical parlance isleport number two was sit-
uated in lat - and long - west and
was in direct line between new york and the azores
approximately twelve hundred miles from each it was
therefore in the path of the north atlantic eddy
which takes its eastward movement from the current
friction of the gulf stream a hundred miles or so
to the north of the isleport some four hundred miles
to the south of it was that mass of seaweed throw
out by the motion of the eddy known as the sargasso
sea the location therefore was one calculated to
suggest the analogy with that land of ancient lore
supposed now to lie at the bottom of the ocean but
this resemblance to its ancient prototype carried a
deeper significance for as the legend of the lost at-
lantis provided for the ancients the allurement of a
new destiny which led them to progress and discov-
ery so was this modern antitype destined to mark a
new stage in human progress the beginning of a new
voyage of discovery in the furtherance of international
peace and concord

  guests arriving at the isleport by airplane alighted
on a vast level field which constituted the upper land-
ing deck from this deck they were conducted down
a long inclined ramp to the fourth deck known as the
palm garden here they entered the hotel at the


amazing stories quarterly

seventh floor and descended by elevator to the third
floor on which the offices were located there were
two floors of the hotel to each outer deck and the office
floor was therefore on the same level as the second
deck in addition to the offices the third floor of the
hotel included the main dining room theatre music
room and a large open foyer which offered the facil-
ities of a general assembly and lounging room and
gave access to reading and writing rooms on the same
level the fourth story was provided with an inner
court or mezzanine which looked down into the foyer
on the floor below beneath the office floor on the sec-
ond level were grill room reading room smoking and
game rooms while the first floor contained a large
bathing pool the tank being underslung beneath the
level of the first deck

   the lower deck of the isleport was used for en-
gineering purposes it provided extensive machine
shops for the repair of planes and for general attention
to the mechanical equipment of the isleport on this
deck the hotel expanded into two lateral wings hous-
ing the shops pumps compressors and generators
which furnished power light and heat outside of
these wings were stored a number of lifeboats and
seagoing motor launches which were kept equipped
and provisioned at all times for emergency

   the second deck provided a nine hole golf course
number one tee was located near to the front end of
the hotel and the fairway extended toward the far end of
the deck but bore slightly inward about fifty yards
from this tee a ravine dipped down some twenty feet
toward the lower deck the sides of this ravine were
dotted with outcropping rock ledges and a drive from
the first tee must needs be well over a hundred and
fifty yards in order to safely cross this hazard the
course was covered with grass while bushes trees
and shrubbery were skillfully arranged to provide
plenty of rough ground the supporting columns of the
structure offered many obstacles to the balls and made
straight driving essential on the opposite end of the
isleport beyond where the fifth fairway dog-legged
around the rear end of the hotel an artificial lake
some eighty yards across provided a water hazard
this lake was dotted with pond lilies and surrounded
with bushes and rough ground and the approach to the
fifth green was directly across it the links offered
bunkers sand traps and all the paraphernalia of a
golfers paradise laid out with such consummate skill
and wealth of engineering and landscape gardening that
the course carried the conviction of a natural stretch
of terra firma with no suggestion that earth trees
and lakes were sustained in mid-air by means of a
steel structure the holes ranged from a hundred and
fifty to three hundred and fifty yards not long holes
for the most part but beset with difficulties far greater
than those usually encountered

  the space between decks was thirty feet on the
average but for structural purposes this height was
not uniform there were sections where it reached
forty feet in height due to the fact that the decks
were stepped up or down in order to provide for more
adequate bracing and bridging and the layout of
the course had been skillfully arranged to take ad-
vantage of this variation in heigtit in such a manner
as to give greater room for the ordinary trajectory
of the balls at those sides where the fairways par-
alleled the outer edges of the structure a wall of wire
netting prevented the loss of balls in the ocean the
light between the decks was excellent and uniform
owing to the fact that on the ocean light is reflected
from the facets of the waves at every possible angle
it permeated between the decks giving light of great
strength and power yet without the blinding glare of

sunlight the effect would have been impossible any
where except upon the ocean

   the third deck was equipped with tennis courts a
childrens playground and an outdoor gymnasium
here the guests could receive instruction in fencing or
could play shuffleboard or various other games in
which they might wish to indulge around the out-
side of the isleport on this level was a wide walk cov-
ering a distance of a mile and a half in the circuit
the various branches of athletics and recreation were
in charge of a corps of instructors who looked after
the physical well-being of the guests and gave special
instruction in any sports desired

   the fourth deck was as previously noted the palm
garden and in its presence the renowned hanging
gardens of babylon must have been dimmed if not
eclipsed by the greater luxuriance of the semi-tropical
verdure in some subtle manner the palm has become
the symbol of ease and luxury-of a life that may be
lived without effort we associate its presence with
tropical countries where life runs smoothly along the
even tenor of its way unmoved by the struggle for ex-
istences which is accelerated in proportion to the
rigors of the climate but the presence of the palm
has contributed to the ease of this struggle rather
than derived its associations from it in those parts
of the earth to whose soil it is indigenous in a gen-
eral way it might be said that were all other vegeta-
tion destroyed those countries which include the palm
in their flora could obtain from its various species all
the necessities of life some eight hundred uses have
been catalogued for the palmyra palm found in india
and ceylon from the fruit of the cocoanut and date
palms may be obtained food milk butter and oil
the sap produces jaggery a kind of sugar or it may
be fermented to make wine and arrack or again it
may be made into soap candles or wax from the
cocoanut shell are made cups and bowls while in some
localities the spines from the leaves are used for arrow
and spear tips the wood is used for furniture and
takes a beautiful polish and the leaves are used for
thatch rugs writing paper and ropes

however it was not with a view to any of these
specific uses that the palm had been introduced by
holden into the plans for his floating isleports but
rather that they might bring from their native habitat
something of that peace and restfulness which is man-
ifested in the lives of those whose lot is cast within
their graceful shadows the temperature of atlantis
ranging between  and  f was well adapted
to the growth of many of the more than a thousand
species of this family and from these a score or more
of varieties had been selected there were heavy bodied
acrocomias with their ringed columns surmounted
with crowns of feathery plumage mingled with the
more slender stemmed kentias some of the latter re-
sembling the rush-like bamboo there were seaforthias
from new south wales with buttressed bases and
straight columns rising fifteen or twenty feet in the
air and surmounted by flat wide spreading tops then
there were the attaleas or oil palms which produce
a finer grade of oil than the cocoanut the howeas
resembling the kentias and used for thatch and the
low ornamental date palms the latanias or bour-
bon palms with their fan-like leaves were not so suit-
able for the rough treatment of the atlantic breezes
as the pinnate leaved varieties the taller genuses
were of necessity omitted on account of the limita-
tions imposed by the landing deck though there were
some which towered from thirty to forty feet between
decks and a few of greater height were planted near
to the edge of the garden with their bodies inclined
a modern atlantis



outward in such a manner as to pass outside of the
landing deck their tufted crowns rising high above
the isleport all of the trees were braced to the
structure to secure them against the effect of wind
and storm

  it would be a mistake however to infer that palms
were the only family of plant life which adorned the
palm garden the walks were bordered with ferns
almost infinite in their variety while here and there
were scattered a few of the delicate feathery mimosas
the structural columns beams and braces were fes-
tooned with running varieties of the palm and with
the bougainvillea vine whose large clusters of flowers
surrounded by their deep rose colored bracts added a
fascinating touch of color to the green of the palms

  throughout the garden the paths were widened in
sheltered places to give room for small tables and
steamer chairs and on pleasant days many guests
were wont to lunch here under the magic spell of
rustling leaves and the songs of the birds here also
came the artist to paint the author to write and the
book-lover to read amid the twin charms of ocean and
forest in the center of a broad plaza fronting the
hotel a fountain played into a marble rimmed basin
and from its overflow a running brook trickled in a
winding course throughout the length of the garden
mjjv losing itself beneath overhanging shrubbery then
coursing over rocks and beneath fantastic bridges
while here and there it widened to form alabaster pools
which caught the reflection of the graceful lanceolate
leaves as they swayed to and fro in the gentle breezes

  sunrise and sunset from the palm garden was a
sight never to be forgotten changeable through all
combinations of color and mutations of cloud and
mist the great luminary rose sometimes scintillating
or again refulgent in the red robes of matutinal birth
darting its horizontal rays through the leafy para-
dise and turning each leaf to gold or setting in a
bank of brilliant cerise flaunting its long streamers
across the heavens then suddenly dropping from sight
behind the horizon of troubled white-capped waves it
presented a symphony of colors beyond power of de-
scription then the afterglow never twice alike
changing from moment to moment and as it changed
tinting the crests of the rollers with red purple mauve
pink or gold the clouds above meanwhile assuming
fantastic shapes their edges fringed with the colors
reflected on the waves to an observer standing among
the palms and looking out through their arching grace-
fulness the sight was calculated to inspire with the
romance of color the sentient artistry that lies deep in
the roots of every soul

  but one cannot linger too long amidst the beauties
of this resort without giving some consideration to
the elaborate means that had been provided to meet
the various demands of such a haven far removed from
the ordinary sources of power which haye become an
integral part of our modern life the meeting of
these demands had been accomplished only through
feats of engineering that would have daunted a less
indefatigable worker than bob holden the isleport
needed power for its compressors pumps and gener-
ators for light and heat and he had wrested it from
wind and wave beneath the lower deck was an elab-
orate system of tubes running transversely across the
structure these tubes caught the wind and as it
whirled through the long passages it revolved the
turbines which drove the generators and converted the
power of the winds into electric energy

  a similar series of tubes beneath the surface of the
ocean utilized the motion of the waves for the same
purpose while storage batteries took up the excess

energy and held it in order that it might be utilized
in time of calm in much the same manner as that of
the storage battery in an automobile

   the water system of the isleport was threefold salt
water was pumped from deep down in the ocean
passed through filters and offered for use in the baths
and swimming pool rain water was collected by gut-
ters from the vast field of the upper landing deck and
conducted through filters into large storage tanks which
were suspended in the bottle bridge work well down
beneath the surface to avoid the necessity of carrying
their weight above the water from these tanks the
water was lifted by air pressure to laundry and bath
and also for use in the fountain and gardens drink-
ing water was supplied from the mainland by means of
a specially constructed tank boat and was kept cold in
a tank also submerged deep in the ocean arrange-
ments were further provided for the distillation of
water for drinking purposes in case of necessity the
rain was another reliance

the hotel extended transversely across the center
of the isleport although its length was less by
some two hundred feet than the width of the decks
the front end of the hotel was pointed like the bow
of a boat so that with the isleport anchored to the
buoy in the center of its long side this bow-shaped end
faced the wind this arrangement served to greatly
lessen the wind resistance of the structure and at the
same time the power tubes extending transversely
across the structure beneath the lower deck were held
in the position of greatest efficiency

  the eighth floor of the hotel at the front end ex-
tended out over the fourth deck leaving beneath it a
broad passage which connected the palm garden on
either side of the hotel this overhanging floor com-
prised the laboratories of bob holden and beneath its
jutting eaves was the outer door through which he
had passed when he entered with miss cromwell on
the night of their arrival at the extreme outer end
of this over-hanging structure was a circular room
built of steel plate and containing no windows and
this room was surmounted by a semi-spherical dome
above the level of the landing deck which gave to it
the appearance of an astronomical observatory its
outer walls were covered with clematis and bougain-
villea vines which gave to it something of the ap-
pearanceof a turreted castle and added much to the
beauty of the garden

   travellers who had stopped at the other isleports of
the trans-atlantic airplane service inc had noted
that isleport number two alone possessed an observa-
tory and among the guests the subject provided the
ground work for many queer surmises gradually this
circular room had gathered about it an air of mystery
enhanced by that type of romantic fiction which at
least serves the purpose of a mental gymnasium for
the otherwise masterful inactivity of the social gossip

  one woman frequenter of the resort had learned
through a cousin in washington that this room had
been provided by the united states hydrographic
office for the purposes of investigation but had never
been used owing to lajik of appropriations another
was author of the report that it had been built by a
retired scientist who held large stock interests in the
company but that he had died before the isleports
were formally opened and that the room had never
been used many other fantastic stories were in
circulation but only a few of the more astute visitors
persisted in linking the name of bob holden with the
mystery inasmuch however as no one had ever
known of holdens visits to the isleport this report like
the others lacked verification


amazing stories quarterly

  the financing of the enterprise had not been the
difficult task that holden had at first expected as
early as may  colonel charles a lindbergh had
made the first non-stop flight from new york to paris
in his report of this flight colonel lindbergh had
pointed out that any attempt at regular trans-atlantic
passenger service by airplane would require a system of
weather observation stations and water stations along
the route his daring single handed flight had given
a great impetus to the project for a regular passenger
service but it was universally admitted by aviators
that this would not be realized until a system of mid-
ocean roadsteads was established such a system
would solve the difficult problem of fuel carriage which
otherwise presented one of the greatest difficulties
moreover the cost of such a system would not be pro-
hibitive some two or three of the existing trans-
atlantic steamship lines together represented a capital
outlay equal to that demanded by the entire isleport
system and it was rightly reasoned that such a system
with the many advantages offered to the traveller
would soon exercise a virtual monopoly in the passenger
carrying business isleport number one had first been
constructed and operated for a season as a week-end
resort and had effectually demonstrated the feasibility
of the enterprise within a few months after the open-
ing of the system every european steamship line had
been compelled to drop all first class classification and
lower their rates in order to remain in business and
some lines had dropped the passenger service entirely
and were handling freight only the financial side of
the venture was therefore a success from the be-
ginning the second year had seen the service doubled
and the stock market had experienced many an anxious
day as a result of this enterprise

  the success of the venture however was dependent
upon the man who had first conceived the plan a less
thorough investigator must surely have overlooked some
important detail a less indefatigable worker would
have succumbed early in its development to the dif-
ficulties to be surmounted but bob holden never
faltered never lost faith in the enterprise nor in his
ability to make it a success he had personally
checked all calculations and supervised all drawings
had handled the purchase of materials organized a
corps of marine engineers draughtsmen and material
inspectors and provided means for the testing of each
part of the equipment before it was assembled into
the structure the isleports had been assembled in the
deep waters of hampton roads by means of specially
designed floating docks

   the problem of towing the isleports to their various
destinations had been one of unimaginable difficulties
they could not be moved through the waters at an
average rate exceeding two miles an hour storms and
currents had to be taken into consideration no tow-
ing company was equipped for the extraordinary ven-
ture and no marine insurance would underwrite the
risk six tugs had been constructed for the purpose
wide of beam and equipped with high powered low
speed diesel engines but the question of carrying
fuel for the long journey was one which threatened
for a time to prove the nemesis of the undertaking
finally it was decided on holdens suggestion to tow
the isleports into the gulf stream then to drift with
the current to the point nearest their final destination
thus conserving fuel finally they would be towed
from such a point to their final destination thus it
was due to the extraordinary completeness of the plans
in every detail and the provisions made to meet every
emergency that this greatest engineering feat of all
times was made possible

   each isleport had finally been anchored in its prear-
 ranged position without mishap and tonight the
 builder of dreams slept peacefully on his own material-
 ization slept as orion and the pleiades and the milky
 way passed in succession over his head and as the sun
 arose and the smoke curled upward from the camp-
 fires of thibet and afganistan and from the chimneys
 of eastern middle and western europe slept as the
 sun shot its slanting rays through the palm garden
 of isleport number two and rose higher and higher
 into the sky slept until the rattle and roar of the
 subways of new york carried their millions of cliff-
 dwellers downtown into the maelstrom of business
 slept while the news-boys on the corners loudly cried
 from their extras the headlines which brought con-
 sternation to the western world

robinson crusoe

when holden retired on the night of his arrival
at isleport number two he had decided upon a
few days of absolute rest after that he would
begin certain experiments on the problem which had
for some time been engrossing all his attention and in-
terest accordingly he did not awake on the following
morning until the sun was nearing its zenith as he
looked from his window he noted that the palms were
casting short shadows in the garden and a noontime
quiet pervaded the place slipping quickly into his
bath he whistled an aria from the opera that had come
over the air the previous night he was cheerful and
happy as he heard miss cromwell moving about the
library and caught the appetizing aroma of coffee
coming through the open transom

   he emerged from his room clad in a neat gray sport
suit and was greeted cheerfully by kitty cromwell
who wore however a puzzled expression as she said
i tried for ten minutes to call up the chief steward
and have breakfast sent up but could get no answer
so i have prepared a light breakfast

   he crossed the room picked up the receiver and
slowly worked the hook up and down the telephone
was apparently dead must be a defective connec-
tion he said but its too late for breakfast in the
hotel anyway and after we have finished ill attend to
the telephone and we can lunch there later

  holden opened the long windows overlooking the
palm garden and they enjoyed their grapefruit coffee
and toast as the gentle but invigorating september
breeze blew softly through the room occasionally the
chirrup of a bird mingled with the song of the surf
to break the noonday hush and they spoke but seldom
yielding themselves to the serenity with which nature
had enveloped the place

   breakfast over holden arose and went out into the
passage at the far end was a door leading into the
main hallway of the hotel this was kept locked but
he produced a pass key and opened it and was soon
standing before the elevator shaft he pushed the but-
ton and waited but there was no response-no sound of
the moving cage nor flashing of the indicator bulbs
he pushed the button again and again but with like
results so he was finally compelled to walk down the
five flights to the office floor at the fourth floor he
turned aside and walked out onto the mezzanine where
he could look down into the foyer below open books
magazines and newspapers lay scattered about on
tables and chairs giving to the place a rather dis-
ordered appearance but not a person was in sight
this absence of people puzzled him until he reflected
that it was nearly time for the express plane from
europe and the people would naturally have gathered
a modern atlantis



at the outer end of this overhanging structure was a circular room built of steel plate and containing no windows and this room was
surmounted by a semi-spherical dome above the level of the landing deck which gave to it the appearance of an astronomical observatory

on the landing deck with the disabled telephone and
the absence of elevator service on his mind he de-
scended the remaining flight to the offices this laxity
in service demanded that a severe reprimand be given
the manager unless some unforeseen circumstance had
been instrumental in putting the electric service out of
commission arriving at the desk he found it also
deserted and with mingled feelings of consternation
and anger he passed through the office to an inner
door opening into the private office of the manager
the key was in the door and the door itself stood
ajar he opened it to find the room vacant and the
large hotel safe open and empty overwhelmed with
amazement he returned to the outer office and made
a more thorough examination the hotel register had
been removed but the room file contained cards for
more than a hundred and seventy guests what could
have happened to have caused this sudden evacuation
could some roving captain kidd with his band of
bold buccaneers have visited the place for the purpose
of robbery there was no evidence of combat or
bloodshed and surely no privateer would have burdened
himself with a human cargo of more than two hun-
dred robbery was dismissed from his mind as a
possible motive everything indicated an orderly
leave-taking then he suddenly remembered that
neither miss cromwell nor himself were registered in
the hotel no one was even aware of their presence
and whatever circumstances might have occurred de-
manding the evacuation of the isleport they would
not have been notified

  he walked out upon the golf course and de-
scended the ramp far enough to get a view of the
lower deck the life-boats were lashed to their moor-
ings and covered with tarpaulins the motor launches
were likewise undisturbed reascending he passed
up the series of ramps constantly ascending until he
stood on the landing deck the isleport was unques-
tionably deserted

  bob holden was not the type of man to be easily
disconcerted but the unusual situation presented by
this evacuatiop of the isleport confronted him with a
problem which aside from the question of its causes
was calculated to overthrow his plans for the furth-
erance of an investigation of great importance which
it had been the object of this visit to bring to com-
pletion but beyond this there was also the possi-
bility of damage to the isleport and its equipment
then again there was the still greater problem of its
causes nothing short of some imminent peril a
peril which might involve their own safety would
appear to account for such an unpremeditated move
but try as he would he could think of nothing of
sufficient gravity to lead to such extreme measures
as he slowly turned his footsteps back toward the
apartment he paused often by the way to review the

various aspects of the incomprehensible situation he
wondered whether the other isleports had been sim-
ilarly vacated then his thoughts turned to kitty
cromwell and the strange turn of events that had
led to their being marooned here together while it

was true they were not shipwrecked nor could the
isleport be called a desert island save for the absence
of other human beings yet in the main they were
left in that situation which from the dawn of litera-
ture has occupied the minds of writers of fiction
his thoughts finally led him to the decision to get
into communication with his office in new york and
even though he should feel the necessity of himself
remaining on the isleport he would provide means
for her return

   as he opened the door to his library he met kitty
cromwell on the point of leaving in search of him
she had spent an anxious hour waiting for his re-
turn and was beginning to sense the occurrence of
some unusual event or possibly an accident his ex-
pression as he crossed the room and beckoned her
to be seated added an intangible air of mystery to
the growing enigma

   guess we are selected as the principals in a mod-
ern version of crusoe he said our fairy island
save for our own presence is suddenly and unac-
countably deserted-not even a footprint to indicate
the presence of man friday

   deserted she repeated but how-last night did
you not see the crowd on the landing deck

   he nodded with an enigmatic smile as if almost
doubting the evidence of his own senses as he replied
yes but all have disappeared in a single night all
are gone we alone are left

   she had arisen and stood before him now unable
to grasp the full meaning of what he had said it
is a joke you are trying to tease me some of your
friends are playing a joke on us-on you she cor-
rected to all of which he shook his head and she
knew by his demeanor the truth of the thing he had
stated something has occurred he resumed to
cause the sudden evacuation of the isleport and our
presence here not being known to the office we were
naturally not notified i am sorry to have been in-
strumental in bringing about such a state of affairs

i should have notified the office immediately upon our
arrival instead of following my usual course on coming
here

she stepped swiftly across to the table and turned
the dial of the radio but no sound came from it
her action however brought back to him his previous
decision to get in touch with his office and quickly
arising from his chair he took her by the arm and
led her out into the passage down the stairs and
around the hotel to the radiotelegraph room find-
ing the door unlocked they entered and holden seated
himself in the operators chair he adjusted the
head-phones to his ears and rapidly turned switches
and dials to see what might be on the air at first
there was no response and he was about to take the
key and call his office code signal when there came
a faint whistle which in response to his tuning
quickly resolved itself into the dots and dashes of
the continental code he sat quietly before the in-
strument for fifteen or twenty minutes then as the
signals died he opened the antennae switch and facing
kitty cromwell said

  it has come the thing we talked about last
night the european alliance consisting of eight
nations has prepared to strike a crushing blow against
the united states i could not get full particulars
the message was sent from london by the interna-
tional wireless news association it appears that a
council was held in vienna yesterday and lasted far
into the night england was invited to join the alli-
ance but refused she has now been offered along with
other european non-members freedom from molesta-

tion as a recompense for their neutrality france has
accepted and england will probably do likewise her
council of state is still in session and can hardly do
othenvise united states diplomatic officials have
been handed their passports and have left the euro-
pean capitals for england the united states am-
bassador to england has communicated with the gov-
ernment at washington and all american ships and
airplanes have been warned either to make for america
immediately or to intern in their nearest neutral port
all europe is aflame a powerful fleet of airplanes and
naval vessels have already been concentrated for an
attack on america which is expected to be launched
without delay all of our planes from here to the
azores must have returned early this morning and
picked up the inhabitants from all the isleports
those in england will in all probability fly directly to
america there would be six between the azores
and the united states and each one is capable of
carrying a hundred and seventy-five passengers and
crew

   could you not send for one of your planes to come
out and take us back she asked

  he shook his head as in doubt it will probably
be impossible all planes will have been comman-
deered by the government and none will be allowed to
leave however i will do my best to get you safely
back personally i shall remain here as i have work
to do and this turn of events may bring to me an
exceptional opportunity he reached for the send-
ing key but she stayed his hand

  i am not a quitter she said if you stay so
shall i if there is danger or risk in remaining
there is no reason why i should not share in it war
is not new to me and there may be some ways in
which i can also be of service

  he extended his hand and she placed hers in it
to seal the compact and in that simple act a new
comradeship was born out of the subtle quality of
the emergency that confronted them for to both there
had come the intangible lure of this adventure beck-
oning them onward it is yours to choose he said
and after all there may be something in the raison
detre of things that has placed you here i confess
that i should see you leave with regret for i have a
feeling that before this is over i shall need you

   his expression of such a thought pleased her for
she had sometimes felt keenly his unconscious assump-
tion of self-sufficiency and had inwardly resented it
for to the sex that has mothered the race no attitude
on the part of others may stir up as keen resentment
as that which fails to acknowledge their individual
usefulness or necessity but in behalf of holden
let it be noted that his self-sufficient attitude was re-
lated only to the scientific side of his nature his
achievements had forced him to be self-reliant he
worked in a field of his own creation and his reliance
on himself was therefore not the result of egotism
but of necessity for egotism is a state of mind which
is impossible to a man of vision who must by his
very nature comprehend the immensity of the field
in which his own achievements however outstanding
are at best insignificant

  kitty cromwell had moreover another reason for
desiring to render appreciated service to holden a
reason that had been giving her many anxious moments
as her interest in and admiration for him increased
this anxiety was related to certain stipulations of
dr von sturm he had among other things asked
her for frequent periodic reports on everything touch-
ing holden his ideas work anything she could glean
from conversation or observation these had been
his exact words adroitly impressed upon her and ac-
a modern atlantis



companied by a wealth of medical discussion-too
much discussion she had felt at the time he had
seemed to over-emphasize the necessity and had left
her with the feeling that she was but little less than
a spy on the man whom she had been commissioned
to restore to health but she knew that dr von
sturms methods were unusual and he had based
his demand upon the necessity of knowing his patient
thoroughly thereby the better to be enabled to pre-
vent him from detrimental occupations or excesses
the salary was liberal almost too liberal she thought
to be sure holden was able to pay liberally but why
had the doctor insisted on supplementing her salary
by additions from his own purse nurses however
were often called upon to do unusual things and were
not expected to reason why but reason about it
as she would there was always an intuitional feeling
of unrest when she thought of dr von sturms re-
quirements however she would use her own judg-
ment when it came to the reports and now that they
were under war conditions she would not be expected
to send any for some time at least

 they had left the wireless room and walked to-
gether each busy with his own thoughts out into the
palm garden scanning the horizon they could see
far to the north a faint wisp of smoke from some
ocean liner scurrying for america the wind had
risen and a heavy swell was breaking through the
bridge work underneath suddenly there was a shock
and the isleport trembled as a higher roller broke
over the lower deck which ordinarily was thirty or
forty feet above the sea level her face blanched as
she looked at him saying the sea-cocks had you
forgotten them you told about your instructions last
night and now the isleport is much lower

 catching her by the hand he raced her down the
ramps down and down until they reached the lower
deck but in theirhaste they had failed to properly
time their arrival for just as they reached the lower
deck they saw a giant roller with upcurved crest
swooping down upon them it was too late to retreat
so he threw an arm about her and hooked the other
arm around a post to which the ramp was attached
at the same time he swung her into such a position
that the force of the wave would be diminished by
breaking over him first on it came and while an
instant before it had seemed that it would arrive all
too soon now the moments dragged as they awaited
the impact tons of water swept over the deck it
tore at his arm but he held on and clasped her tightly
to him the deluge passed the waters lowed from
the deck making little rivulets from the scuppers at
the sides but still he held her-held her until she
moved slightly to free herself at the time he could
not account for the feeling that he was in an especial
sense her protector he would have done the same
for anyone else but would he have had the same
feeling of elation in shielding another he released
her from the embrace in which he had held her but
still clasped her tightly by the arm as they made a
dash for the door of the compressor room

it is one of the doctrines of modern psychology that
the interpretation of an idea or the meaning at-
tached to any individual experience depends for each
individual upon the associations which they have built
up during their past experiences two people there-
fore subjected to the same set of outward circum-
stances would exhibit very different reactions our
perception of things therefore never gives to us a true
picture of the thing itself but only of the thing as
it appears to us in the light of previous experiences
this fact might well lead us into the philosophical

discussion of whether we really know anything from
the standpoint of its own essential being but waiv-
ing the deeper discussion of such recondite matters
it must nevertheless be admitted that the broader and
more varied our experiences have been with regard
to any given subject the better are we fitted for the
interpretation of new experiences of a similar nature

  as kitty cromwell and bob holden entered the
compressor room and turned on the lights the scene
which met their eyes was a complex which held for
each of them widely variant meanings what she be-
held was in its general significance merely a mass
of machinery her eyes wandered down the long
lines of turbines and compressors attracted here and
there by the polished brass of the oiling system and
the shining steel of the motors proper the low hum
of the lighting generators run by the wind turbines
which had been left in operation was scarcely noticed
by her unpracticed ear at the end of the room a
large control board covered with switches and polished
clock-like gauges caught her eye and fascinated her
imagination while it baffled her uninitiated mind to
interpret the meaning and use of the individual items
but for holden each separate piece of apparatus had
its definite purpose and she could not but marvel at
the coolness and assurance with which he set to
work his every move betokened the definiteness of
exact knowledge there was no indecision and not
a moment was wasted

she had been unconscious of the low hiss of escap-
ing air until he threw a switch which started a series
of small motors then as these gathered speed he turned
a wheel which engaged the clutches operating the air
valves and gradually the hissing sound died and the
motors automatically cut out turning to her with
a look of relief on his face he said the air valves
are now closed and no more water can enter the
bottles the isleport is safe then leading her to
the control board he pointed out a series of electrically
controlled depth gauges which showed the height to
which the water had risen in the bottles normally
he said these gauges should show a hundred and
eighty feet above the water level in the bottles and
this level should never be less than a hundred and
sixty feet the gauges now show a hundred and
sixty-three another hour and we would have been
too late

  he was working again now with the same assur-
ance and quick decisiveness throwing switches and
levers and passing rapidly from one machine to an-
other she heard the hum of starting motors then
the rapidly increasing pulsations of the compressors
from time to time the structure trembled as some
higher roller washed over the lower deck but with
the compressors all in action forcing air into the bot-
tles against the tremendous weight of the isleport
the structure was lifted little by little out of the
danger zone of the waves as they waited holden
explained to her the mysteries of the different types
of machines and taught her how to distinguish be-
tween compressor turbine motor and pump gradu-
ally under his tuition the appearance of the room
and its equipment seemed to undergo a change as
there came to her a more accurate understanding of
its paraphernalia after half an hour he shut down
the compressors and closed the sea-cocks as they
stepped forth again upon the lower deck the rollers
were running far beneath them

  how foolish of me to forget he said yet the
order was issued many months ago at the suggestion
of the navy department the other isleports prob-
ably now lie at the bottom of the ocean i am glad
that you thought of it in time judging from the


amazing stories quarterly

depth to which the isleport had settled i would think
the evacuation took place between seven and eight
oclock this morning the cabinet meeting in wash-
ington took place last night and the warning must
have reached our fields in england and the azores
during the night now we must prepare for the
emergency i shall spend most of my time in the
laboratory from now on and will have to depend upon
you for our meals should you need anything not
in the pantry i can get it from the hotel store room
you will find plenty to interest you for a few days
wandering about the isleport and we will not have to
wait long

  it was after two oclock when he left her and she
wandered out into the palm garden and picked up a
magazine but soon found it impossible to keep her
mind on the printed page with so many startling
events pressing upon her her gaze drifted off across
the rolling blue ocean the world was about to be
plunged into the horrors of war again and she shud-
dered as she reviewed some of the scenes of another
conflict she had done a prodigious amount of war
work then although but just in her teens knowing
nothing about it when she began it but she had done
it well now she knew the awfulness of it and her
soul recoiled at the contemplation of another reign
of strife it maddened men made them hate because
of an intangible something called patriotism which
stirred up a tangible atavistic lust to kill would
the world never learn that war meant inevitable
loss no matter what the fancied gain she recalled
holdens words of the previous night a single man
may some day hold the fate of the world in his
hands-it would be fortunate for the world should
such a discovery come to one who would use it for
world peace

  suddenly she was startled and arose from her chair
a shadow seemed to have passed over her and she had
that vague perturbing sense of being watched but
look as she might into every nook and shadow of the
garden she could see nothing to arouse suspicion
she decided to wander about the isleport and finally
went to the apartment and rummaged about in its
closets until she unearthed a set of golf clubs-then
went down to the links the afternoon air was in-
vigorating and she became so engrossed in making
the round that the sun was low down toward the
horizon before she bethought herself of the new
duties laid upon her to provide meals for holden and
herself ascending hastily up the ramps she crossed
the palm garden where she had sat earlier in the
afternoon she was again startled to note that the
magazine which she had laid down back upwards upon
a table now lay in a chair some distance from where
she had sat she would question holden at dinner
to find out whether he had been in the palm garden
but would do it adroitly so as not to alarm or worry
him but the later events of the evening made such
interrogation unnecessary

chapter iv
decoding a discovery

although a product of the modern age and a
fi believer in the economic independence of
women kitty cromwell held to a few old-
fashioned ideas among which was the doctrine that
every woman should be able to prepare an appetizing
and wholesome meal often her career as a nurse
had placed her in circumstances where such an art
was an asset of the greatest value there were also
times when satiated by the monotony of food procured
from the vendors of table delicacies whether in hotel

restaurant or in that mongrel of the species known as
a delicatessen store she would seek in her apartment
to rejuvenate the jaded appetites of herself and friends
with delicious concoctions of her own materialization
the request of bob holden that afternoon had come
therefore as an inspiration to do her bit in the pro-
gram he was endeavoring to carry out rather than
as an irksome duty and she set to work upon the
evening meal with a song in her heart and upon her
lips

  it was dark when holden returned from his work
in the laboratory and he smiled brightly as he beheld
her in a gaily colored apron and was greeted by the
enticing aroma of chops muffins and other delicacies
dear to the heart of a club habitu the atmosphere
was one of home life and reminded him of his boy-
hood days on a new england farm when his mother
had provided food often frugal but of a memory
that still lingered with him

  the dinner was carried off with a spirit of good
fellowship and the room rang with laughter as they
told amusing incidents of earlier days especially when
he demonstrated how the boys at a certain college he
had attended forced all freshmen to somersault their
spoons over their forks to land upright in their cups
before they were allowed coffee or tea neither one
mentioned the shadow of war hanging over them nor
the perils or hazards of their situation both knew
that the sword of damocles hung above them but they
were willing for a time to forget it

  dinner over holden reached to the table and started
to tune in the radio but the only sounds were a
series of whistles and spurts which recalled the radio
bugbear but suddenly his experienced ear caught and
recognized certain signals and reaching for pencil and
paper he began to record a series of dots and dashes
but whatever the purport of the message might be
it was in code and he could make nothing of it then
as it ceased he pushed the paper aside and said
there will be nothing on the air tonight as the
government will have sealed all broadcasting stations
until arrangements have been completed for the cen-
soring of all news but lets go out to the radio tele-
graph room perhaps we can pick up something
from england

  as he was about to rise from the receiver he sud-
denly bent over and examined one of the dials on
which was indicated the meter wave length thats
funny he observed that wave length is the same as
we use throughout our isleport system and the message
wasnt in our code i didnt know that anyone else
was on the same wave length

  they proceeded without delay to the radio room
where they had earlier in the day received news of
the war it was equipped with apparatus similar to
that found on most of the large ocean liners its
sending equipment was of the continuous wave type
and utilized three one-half k w tubes in parallel
these tubes were not water cooled as in some of the
higher powered land stations the reception was re-
corded by means of a light flashed on a moving strip
of motion picture film which when developed made
a permanent record it was also provided with head
phones for tuning in

  as holden seated himself at the instrument he was
mentally engrossed with the matter of the wave length
which he had noticed before leaving his apartment
passing his hands over the apparatus he suddenly
uttered a cry of astonishment as he pointed to the
bank of vacuum tubes those tubes are warm-
some one has been in here thats what i was getting
over the receiver a message sent from this room we
a modern atlantis



are not alone on the isleport i must decode that
message tonight

  to kitty cromwell there came in mental review the
presentiments of that afternoon the impression of
being watched and the circumstance of the magazine
but she quickly decided not to mention these inci-
dents to holden it would only add to his worries
and could do no good she must not do anything that
would interfere with the work he had in hand by
arousing any feelings of uneasiness concerning her
safety or welfare

  holden sat down again and turned the dials seeking
some message from the air but he arose after about
twenty minutes during which time no signals had
come they went out leaving the door unlocked as
they had found it it would be well not to arouse
the suspicions of the third party by any act that
might indicate that his presence there was known to
them then too he might desire to send other
messages which should they be fortunate enough to
intercept them would give some further clue to his
purposes as they walked back to the apartment they
did not know that from a covert in the palm garden
they were being watched but the watcher was not
he who had sent the message a half hour ago

  in the library bob holden analyzed the situation
a wireless operator would not have been placed on
the isleport and left there by mere chance his pres-
ence coupled with the sending of the code message
indicated that he had been placed there for the carry-
ing out of a definite purpose the nature of that pur-
pose would be revealed when the message was decoded
holden had acquired that expertness as a wireless
operator both with the continental and with the older
morse system of dots and dashes which enabled him
to recognize the individual characteristics of the sender
in much the same manner as a musician is enabled to
recognize the playing of one noted artist from that
of another thus he knew intuitively when he was
receiving the message that the sender was an expert
operator who was working under some nervous pres-
sure as if in haste to finish the dots and dashes
had come across rapidly but he had been able to in-
terpret the letters and transcribe them with accuracy
on the paper which now lay on his table but what-
ever the message might be that which lay before him
was a meaningless jargon of letters not forming any
known words

the construction of code messages involves a multi-
tude of systems devised for the purpose of insur-
ing the secrecy of the message from all save the one
to whom it is sent and who is provided with the key
for its interpretation simplest of all the systems is
that which merely substitutes one letter for another
throughout as for example the use of k where e
is intended or the use of h in place of a and
so on throughout the alphabet- but such a code may
be readily decoded by studying the numerical rela-
tionship of the letters used and no message of
valued secrecy would be sent in so simple a code

  of much greater complexity are the so-called inter-
mediate code systems where a key word or phrase is
used as an intermediate between the code sent and
the message intended to be communicated such an
intermediate may be the name of a city or a historical
character a catch phrase or an entire story anything
previously agreed upon between sender and receiver
in using such a system each letter of the intermediate
or key word is added on the basis of its numerical
position in the alphabet to the corresponding letter
in the code message in order to obtain the decoded

message to illustrate we may wish to say meet
me in london tomorrow and as a code intermediate
we will use the word paris the message would run
thus

 code message wdmk - to - hv - cvxcwe

-	aylwiyyv

 key word pari sp ar ispari sparispa

 decoded message meet me in london to-
morrow

  the recipient of the code message merely applies
the word paris as previously agreed upon by adding
p the sixteenth letter of the alphabet to w the
twenty-third letter and the resulting letter is m
in like manner a the first letter is added to d
and the resulting letter is e

 the work of decoding such a message when the
intermediate key word is unknown is often a matter
of great difficulty if the message however is of
such length as to cause the key word to be repeated
a great many times in succession the work of decoding
is greatly facilitated in any case the decoding of
intermediate code messages is a task not to be at-
tempted except by an expert the only message that
may successfully resist the decoding expert is one
wherein the intermediate is a phrase sentence or story
as long as the message itself in such a case the in-
termediate is not repeated

  bob holden had during his residence in washing-
ton at the time of the world war spent many eve-
nings with a classmate who was in the signal corps
and whose duties involved the solution of many so-
called unsolvable code systems which were offered by
their inventors to the government they had often
worked together over these problems and had found
this form of mental gymnastics one which offered a
broader and more varied field than was to be found
in any of the current forms of puzzles the interest
once acquired had been pursued at random intervals
during the succeeding years and he had become quite
expert in the deciphering of difficult code systems
the code used by the isleport system was of his own
invention he now took the code message which he
had tapped earlier in the evening and laying it on
the table before them proceeded to explain to miss
cromwell some of the more important principles in-
volved in decoding the message as he had received
it was

  in the code as received by holden the letters were
grouped in a manner which would correspond to the
words in the final decoded message and this division
was accomplished by the use of a dot and dash charac-
ter differing from any of the characters of the alpha-
bet the use of this character is denoted in the
message as given above by a dash holden had noted
it almost intuitively as he transcribed the message
and had correctly interpreted it as indicating the com-
pletion of a word in the final message he now
explained to kitty cromwell that their first step would
be to determine if possible the number of letters
in the key word if they could determine this they
would then be able to tell at what intervals they
might expect a repetition of the letters of the key

word to this end they proceeded to carefully examine
the code message in order to detect if possible any
similarity of construction they were not long in
noticing two similar words each having four letters
the first two of which were the same in each case
these two words unquestionably corresponded to two

to give w and as i is the ninth letter of the
alphabet while w is the twenty-third the four-
teenth letter which is n was the key letter sought
similarly a letter must be found which added tc
 gives i and this letter was found to be t
the solution of these two words now stood thus

words in the final message each of which would have
four letters if it should happen that the two first
letters in each of these two words were the same it
would naturally indicate that the corresponding letters
in the key word were repeated and would give an
important clue to the number of letters in the key
word these words as indicated in the code were
ioko and iocs they were forty letters apart
in the code message this indicated if his reasoning
should prove correct that forty was some multiple of
the number of letters in the key word it was of
course possible that the key was a phrase or sentence
or it might be a word of eight or possibly of ten let-
ters after some consideration they decided on an
eight letter word as the more probable they began
with the first letter of the code and went through it
pointing it off into groups of eight letters each
using a small dot or period as indicated in the fore-
going message this if correct would serve to show
where any given letter of the key word was repeated
they next considered the two four letter words
ioko and iocs and then made a list of all the
pairs of four letter words they could think of where
the two first letters were the same from this list
they selected as expressing the greatest degree of
probability the words will and with and printed
them in below the two code words in order to test
the value of this solution it was now necessary to
determine the corresponding letters of the key word
in each case something must be added to i in order

 code message ioko iocs

 key word nt nt

 decoded message will with

  if now two other key word letters could be found
which when added to the two remaining letters in
each of the code words would form the decoded words
will and with the solution could hardly be doubted
their first attempt proved a failure they then re-
versed the positions of will and with and the re-
sult was as follows

 code message ioko iocs
 key word n t i s n t i s
 decoded message with will

this result was highly gratifying and they now
applied themselves to the work with redoubled
interest that they had found four letters of the key
word could hardly be doubted referring back to the
original code they noted that both ioko and
iocs corresponded to the last four letters of the
key word if their assumption of an eight letter key
word was correct therefore leaving the first four
letter spaces in each repetition of the key word blank
they went through the message and inserted the
ntis of the key in each of the fifth sixth seventh
and eighth key letter positions throughout the message
from these key letters they next proceeded to fill in
the letters in the decoded message that resulted from
the addition of the four key letters already obtained
a modern atlantis



this process supplied a decoded message consisting mtp
of blocks of four letters alternating with four blank nti
spaces which when completed read	any

it was now a simple matter to find the remaining
letters of the key word from some of the words which
were partially decoded they picked the word labo

letters the key word came to them simultaneously
and they shouted as with one breath atlantis

  holden was elated he had evidently tapped the
message at its very beginning he had not been
in time to hear the station signal but in all probability
it was a private one and would not be listed he
surmised that the message was sent to the mobiliza-
tion base and that he now felt certain would be in
the azores this enemy had played into his hands
and the european alliance he now knew would make
the isleport their base for operations against the
united states they had placed this ravnowickz here
to prepare for their coming then as he thought
over the situation he suddenly laughed aloud and his
companion looked inquiringly at him as she said

poses of mankind would have served the spy a worthy

recompense had it not been for the intervention of
the man whose designs it was the business of ravno-
wickz to frustrate

  the situation which now confronted them was to
say the least hazardous an enemy was on the isle-
port and while holden was too well balanced mentally
to have any fears as to the final outcome he did not
underestimate the sagacity or ingenuity of his enemy
nor the power of the forces arrayed against him re-
flection showed that such a commission would be
intrusted only to a man of unusual resources and
cunning and that the spy would let nothing inter-
fere with the accomplishment of the ends for which
he had been placed there holden felt certain how-
ever that the desire to know more of his own inten-
tions would postpone any open attack on the part
of the spy he had signified in his message that he
was watching holden and that he would prevent any
interference with the designs of the european alliance
but the message also showed very clearly that the spy
was totally ignorant of the coup detat which holden
was preparing if the european alliance thought that
he was in possession of any valuable secrets they
would wish to acquire them for their own use his
first thought therefore must be to keep all knowledge
of his intentions from the enemy furthermore he
must provide against any emergency that might leave
him incapacitated he needed someone on whom he
could rely to act in any capacity under his directions
and there was left to him no choice kitty cromwell
had been referred to in the message as nurse x
what did the spy know of her x in the language
of science stood for the unknown and that was the
obvious interpretation of the message he felt that
he could trust her fully and if he were going to en-
trust to her the secrets of the circular room and the
blow he was preparing to strike he must for the same
reason provide for her protection the spy might
seek to wrest from her the information he desired
she had already retired leaving him to his pipe and
his thoughts but he would talk with her on the morrow

  he went out into the passage to assure himself that
the doors were all securely fastened it was now
past midnight but he had no inclination for sleep
for his mind like that of most students worked best
when the silence of night had shut out the diversions
which the sights and sounds of daytime introduced
only twenty-four hours ago war had been virtually
declared but it seemed as if weeks had been crowded
into the events of that single day for time like space
is measured by the succession of events which occupy
it on the morrow he would make some final tests
and inspection of the apparatus which was housed
under the dome of the circular room he had hoped
for the opportunity to make these tests in the open
with the dome rolled aside but the presence of the
spy would preclude that now he had been working
on this apparatus for a number of years even dur-
ing the later years of the isleport venture it had
been gradually absorbing his interest and taking more
and more definite form the present apparatus had
been installed only for the purpose of making more
complete tests on a more powerful scale than he had
hitherto been able to provide now had come the
opportunity to put it to tests that he had never
dreamed of coming to so soon he would have pre-
ferred another year in which to study and develop it
but there could be no postponement now well he
jvould do his best

  his thoughts wandered back through the years
groping among the friendships of the past he re-
called that night at the harvard club and the scene
passed like a drama before his eyes the pledge he

had made that night had been kept and soon he would
test its fruits where was jerry scott he had not
seen him for the past three or four years jerry had
meant much to him in those days he had bought the
first large block of stock in the isleport venture and
then had left for parts unknown-a wandering spirit
was jerrys how his adventure loving nature would
tingle to be here now letters had come from him
at long intervals from china india and the south
seas the last one from africa where he was about
to depart for the interior on a hunting expedition for
big game some day after this affair was over and
peace restored he would bring jerry here-and the
girl the one who had saved jack rutherford-wonder
if jerry ever-if he ever-but holden had drifted
off to sleep in his arm chair

             chapter v
             out of the past

jerry scott sat at a table in an unobstrusive cor-
ner of a night cafe in budapest he loved the
beautiful vivacious city on the banks of the
danube for it was here that he had come as a young
man to study art the years had left but slight im-
print of their passage upon him he still retained the
well-knit athletic figure of former days his hair had
grayed a bit above the temples but his eyes flashed
with their old time clearness and there was no flab-
biness of flesh on face or body for jerry had always
lived in a clean wholesome manner

  he was disappointed as he sat there not discouraged
nor despondent for these extreme moods were practi-
cally unknown to him he had worked all day in his
studio on a picture that through the years was seldom
out of his mind and ever and anon sought to find
expression at last he thought he had discovered a
model the eyes were deep blue the hair lustrous
black but somehow the expression he sought was not
there and try as he would he could not coax it into
being he had hoped to exhibit at a paris salon the
coming winter and he had hoped to make this his mas-
terpiece but why continue the pursuit of a phantom
honors had come to him without the seeking he
had sufficient wealth to maintain himself in his happy-
go-lucky care-free existence

  now the old restlessness had seized upon him again
he longed for adventure excitement even for hard-
ships for the battle of wits against man or nature
the whole city and country was restless in fact all
europe seethed with an undercurrent of excitement
groups of army officers filled the hotels and cafis
and were the center of interest to all eyes as they
strutted about with a suddenly elevated idea of self-
importance there was an undisguised feeling of ani-
mosity against america american travelers were no
longer welcome they were treated with haughty dis-
dain and in many cases openly insulted even the
money they spent could no longer secure for them the
ordinary courtesies due to travelers and they were
rapidly leaving for england or for home but jerry
scott was a cosmopolitan who spoke the language and
adopted the customs of the native born so he went
about unobserved and unmolested

  the cod was of the order of an old time borkaz or
wine hall with a door at either end as he sat in
the half shadows of his corner he interested himself
with the occupants of the various tables a stringed
orchestra on a raised dais played czigany music
gypsy music submits itself to no musical precepts it
is invented to speak for them it fascinates while its
strident tones annoy at times it was almost drowned
in the babble of conversation and laughter but never
a modern atlantis



quite a strolling band of gypsies entered their color-
ful costumes adding picturesqueness to the kaleido-
scopic scene they began to play and dance it was
the famous csardas or tavern dance loved by all
hungarians a number of the occupants left their
places at the tables and joined in the weird fantastic
movements of the dance it was intoxicating fascinat-
ing in its subtleties and palpitating with power the
music steals over the senses and kindles memories and
yearnings bitter and sweet it scourges while it en-
chains and one longs for the peace and quietude of
nature of the mountains and streams the dancers
race and swing weird notes chase each other up and
down over the strings the music suddenly becomes
rythmical and measured then it mounts again in con-
fusion and the csardas ends in a bursting crescendo

  jerry scott looked around the room not a few of
the denizens of the place were wiping their eyes the
scene was a familiar one to him yet it always accentu-
ated his unrest now he knew why he had come here
he really wanted the unrest it was the chord of the
seventh in his nature which he had never been able
to resolve that was the thing in czigany music that
called to him it was the expression of their own un-
rest the thing that had made them wanderers

  as the evening slipped by new groups entered while
others left but generally the numbers in the room in-
creased a group of army officers entered there was
no vacant table but the attendants hastened to clear one
and none of the occupants objected the army had sud-
denly risen to a position which demanded respectful
deference as its right the round table offered them
was only a short distance from the place where scott
was sitting and as they took their chairs the clanking
of scabbards added to the din and confusion one of
their number was dressed in citizens clothes and was
apparently about to depart the city on some mission
of importance scott payed but slight attention to the
group who talked mostly in undertones until there
suddenly came a loud scraping of chairs and jingle of
accoutrements as they arose and with uplifted glasses
drank a toast to der tag he had heard that toast
twenty years before in the bier-hallen of germany and
its fulfillment had been sealed in blood it aroused him
now and he listened to catch if possible something of
the conversation as it drifted across the intervening
sound waves the man in citizens clothes sat with his
back toward him and the conversation was carried on
in german words and phrases came to him in the
disjointed manner characteristic of words which must
find their way through gaps in the general conversa-
tion-the laughter and the clinking of glasses sud-
denly he caught the words uebersee flugzeug
verkehr then irnel zwei that would be bob
holdens system and isleport number two scott
shifted his seat around the table in order to get
a better view of the party and at the same time place
himself in a deeper shadow another half hour passed
in which he caught nothing further of importance
but noted much conversation carried on in low tones
the party evidently shared in some information which
they did not intend should be revealed finally they
arose again to drink another toast this time to the
success of their departing comrade as the man in
citizens clothes turned from right to left to clink
glasses with his compatriots his side face was turned
in jerry scotts direction he was a powerfully built
man of average height with a slight stoop to his
shoulders which served to accentuate the unusual
length of his arms and his face bore a pointed black
beard which continued up the side face around the
base of the jaw scott was struck by a feeling of
familiarity where had he seen that face before his

artistic training had made him a keen observer of
people and he seldom forgot a face or figure the
group now left the caf and for a time jerry scott
sat there turning over in his mind the pages of the
past then suddenly he jumped to his feet and rushed
from the place hailing a passing taxicab he was
driven rapidly to his hotel he had barely time to
catch a night express train for vienna

  arriving at vienna he watched the passengers dis-
embarking from the train but saw no sign of black-
beard the austrian would probably go by way of
cologne to calais thence by boat to london jerry
scott did not care to shadow his man instead he would
make for london by the fastest route taking airplane
from vienna to paris then from paris to london this
would bring him to the latter place late that after-
noon the austrian would probably be a day later in
arriving once in london he would wait about the
landing field of the trans-atlantic airplane service
inc during such times-as planes were scheduled to
leave until the man he was following put in an ap-
pearance he had never seen any of the isleports of
holdens system but he had read much of them and
knew the general features of the service between the
continents he did not have to wait long late on the
afternoon of the day following his own arrival black-
beard was at the landing field and they took the same
plane for isleport number two leaving london after
dark there were more than a hundred passengers on
the plane so that it was an easy matter for scott to
remain at a distance and yet keep a close watch on his
quarry but through the night the austrian slept and
scott dozed in his comfortable reclining couch chair

they arrived at fayal in the azores early the fol-
lowing morning and seeing that the austrian was
having his ticket punched for a stop-over scott did like-
wise a number of the passengers were stopping over
on thelfsland and others were preparing to take their
places they all disembarked for a time to stretch
themselves while the plane was being refurnished with
fuel and water and examined by the mechanicians the
general bustle and confusion enabled jerry scott to
keep track of his man without appearing to do so

  the landing field was of necessity outside of the
city on a tract of ground covering some hundred acres
or more and situated on a high plateau overlooking
the port a road had been constructed from the landing
field down into the city of sufficient width and evenness
to admit of automotive traffic buses were waiting for
the arrival of the plane and seeing the austrian turn
his bags over to the driver of one of these vehicles
jerry placed his own luggage in the care of the one
immediately following seating himself beside the
chauffeur he questioned him on the way to the port
regarding their destination and found that all the
buses had their terminal at the one principal hotel
leaving directions with the chauffeur for the disposal
of his bags he disembarked a short distance before
they arrived and strolled through the quaint portuguese
streets keeping his eyes meanwhile on the passengers
of the first bus now unloading in front of the hotel
he watched the austrian as he entered the building but
he soon reappeared and entered a waiting automobile
scott summoned another and managed to convey to the
portuguese driver that he wanted to follow at a rea-
sonable distance they wound through a maze of rough
streets and finally entered upon an apparently newly
constructed roadway leading out of the city on the
opposite side to that which they had entered the
road had been cut through the rough volcanic rock
following more or less the devious courses of a series
of ravines until it emerged on a high tableland not

unlike the one at the place where they had landed
that morning on the opposite side of the city as they
came out on this plateau the driver stopped and
seemed unwilling to proceed any further jerry scott
was nonplussed the chauffeur spoke only a few words
in broken english and he could get no explanation from
him finally jerry addressed him in french and the
face of the portuguese brightened as he broke into vol-
uble explanations the plateau was government
ground they would soon encounter the guard who
would question them demand their passes and when
told that they did not have any would probably put
them in prison of late they had become very strict
what were they doing on the plateau he knew not
only work much work leveling it like the floor of a
dance hall they said it was to plant vineyards but-
le diable every one knew that it was not necessary
that a vineyard be so smooth then there were many
men in the city men from all over europe strong
men with square shoulders they wore no uniforms
but it was easy to see that they walked like soldiers
no inducement that scott could offer would persuade
him to go further so he finally ordered him to return
to the hotel at any rate it would not do to risk the
chance of being himself detained while his quarry pro-
ceeded on his way

  arriving again at the hotel he entered and looked
over the register but so far as he was able to de-
termine there was no indication of the austrians sig-
nature he decided therefore to delay his own regis-
tration and await further developments about noon
the man for whom he waited appeared in company with
a group of four others all younger men of distinctive
military bearing as they stood conversing in the
lobby they were joined by another older man of
germanic appearance and wearing a close cropped
mustache as he approached the group the austrian
raised his hand and clicked his heels in the beginning of
a military salute but the gesture was cut short by one
of his companions intercepting his rising arm a low
voiced admonition caused him to change the direction
of motion which ended in an awkward hand-shake
after talking for a few moments the party went to
the elevator and ascended scott spent a weary day
waiting for their reappearance

  it was late in the afternoon when they re-emerged
from the elevator and went into the dining room to-
gether scott followed them mingling with a number
of guests and managed to secure a small table near
to the outer wall a short distance from where the
group were sitting to avoid notice he seated himself
with his back toward them and as he ate perused a
german newspaper which he had picked up in the
lobby but secretly he listened to every word of the
conversation that he could catch turning over the
pages of the paper his eye caught a news item ac-
companied by a photograph which at first glance had
a decidedly familiar look a closer inspection revealed
that it was a picture of the officer who had joined the
group in the lobby the picture showed an officer in
military uniform but the original was now in citizens
dress scott read the item it announced that colonel
- who was one of the leading aeronautical en-
gineers in the german air service had left for lisbon
to confer with the portuguese government relative to
the establishment of an extensive aeroplane service
between lisbon and the azores the service was to be
established for the purpose of rapid transportation of
grapes and other fruits from the islands to the main-
land scott read the article over again carefully it
was evidently published to avoid suspicion should any
one recognize the colonel en route he was more than
dubious of the truthfulness of the account in so far as

it related to the real business in hand something was
certainly brewing he recalled the military activities
in hungary and the journey of the man whom he had
followed here and whose objective was in all probabil-
ity one of bob holdens isleports only twelve hundred
miles from the coast of america why should these
two now be in conference he was certain that the
newly constructed road over which he had ridden that
day led to a landing field for airplanes and the pur-
pose of such extensive and secret preparations was not
to be found in peaceful agricultural pursuits but in
more warlike preparations against the united states
he could catch but little of the conversation and there
was nothing in what he did overhear that was out of
the ordinary trend after dinner they arose and re-
turned to the lobby and scott following overheard the
colonel say then you will leave tonight let me
hear from you when you arrive

jerry scott knew that a plane leaving london
about noon was due to arrive at fayal at ten
v clock that night and would leave an hour later ar-
riving at isleport number two early the next morn-
ing in order to avoid being noticed by the austrian
during the interval of waiting for the plane he secured
his luggage and found a taxi which took him out to
the landing field there were offices and a waiting
room on the field and the employees lived in a small
hotel there scott sought and found the manager of
the station to him he presented his credentials as a
director of the company and they spent the hours until
the arrival of the plane in a conference upon the situa-
tion the manager was an ace of world war fame and
was greatly interested in what scott told him he
had heard rumors but knew very little of what was
actually taking place on the other side of the city as
he and his men were confined very closely by their
duties at the landing field it was finally decided be-
tween them that he was to warn his men secretly to
be ready to leave at a moments notice a spare plane
was kept at the field for use in case of accident or
injury to one of the regular planes this would be
kept fueled and conditioned for a quick getaway to
insure the needed opportunity they decided to keep the
gates to the grounds closed except during the time of
arrival and leaving of planes in case of any trouble
arising he would be notified by wireless from the
companys headquarters in london or new york

  the arrival of the london plane was attended by
the usual confusion of disembarking passengers as the
buses arrived from the hotel he noted with satisfac-
tion the presence of the man whom he was following
many of the passengers were making a stop-over at
the azores and scott found no difficulty in securing
passage he selected a vacant chair in the rear end
of the great car and made himself comfortable for
the night the car was equipped with sleeping chairs
which could be inclined backward at any angle de-
sired and the smooth motion of the airplane was con-
ducive to sleep so the night passed without event

  they arrived at isleport number two shortly after
seven oclock on the morning of the day preceding
holdens arrival jerry scott gave his bags to a
porter on the landing deck and followed the austrian
at a distance the latter was unencumbered with
baggage having evidently left it at fayal this in-
dicated to jerry that he would not be on the hotel
register inasmuch as passengers often stopped over
for a few hours between planes little notice was paid
to arrivals who wandered about as they desired dur-
ing intervals of the service the austrian evidently
knew the ground and wandered about in leisurely
fashion taking a circuitous route which eventually led
a modern atlantis



down the series of ramps to the lower deck from a
secluded position scott watched him as he examined
the life boats and when he thought himself unob-
served the austrian peered underneath the tarpaulin
which covered one of the motor launches and jerry
rightly conjectured that it was his intention to stow
himself away in one of these launches having settled
the matter of the headquarters of his quarry jerry
scott went to the office and registered using an as-
sumed name

  during the remainder of that day and the succeed-
ing one he kept unobtrusive watch over the move-
ments of the austrian the latter kept aloof from the
hotel offices and the more public places remaining in
remote parts of the palm garden he appeared to
be leisurely waiting for the arrival of some person or
event only once did scott see him enter the dining
room and that just after the arrival of one of the
planes

  at seven oclock on the morning of the second day
after his arrival jerry scott was called to the tele-
phone and told to pack his bags leave them in the hall
outside his room and come immediately to the office
as the isleport was to be evacuated dressing quickly
he slipped his largest bag into a closet and left the
others as instructed as he went out to take the ele-
vator for the office floor he found the hall alive with
excited people running to and fro asking questions
which no one could answer arranging baggage and
carrying coats and bundles arriving at the office
floor the elevator opened upon a scene of greater con-
fusion a line was formed to the desk as the guests
checked out the foyer was rapidly filling with ex-
cited groups as each elevator from the upper stories
deposited its human load coffee and sandwiches were
being served in the dining room with everyone stand-
ing while the hotel staff moved from group to group
assuring them that there was no immediate danger
when a majority of the guests had gathered the man-
ager called for silence and explained that the man-
agement had received a radiogram telling them that
war against the united states was imminent and that
the orders were to evacuate the isleports three planes
were on their way two having left fayal in response
to a message from england the third had been halted
at isleport number three and would wait there for
the arrival of the other two then would proceed to the
united states stopping for the passengers at this
isleport three other planes were returning from eng-
land on a non-stop flight

  at a few minutes after eight the three planes ar-
rived they told how they had received the message
just in time to make their getaway while a mob was
storming at the locked gates a few planes from the
landing field on the opposite side of fayal had fol-
lowed them for a short distance then had turned back
the embarkation began jerry scott went through the
crowd looking for the austrian but he was not in
sight he then slipped away in the confusion and
secreted himself in some dense shrubbery in the palm
garden where he remained until long after the last
plane had vanished in the morning haze as he saw
it swallowed up in the western mist he felt that he had
done a foolish thing his love of adventure however
could not be denied if as he now felt certain the
austrian had come to the isleport to prepare a base for
operations against america he scott would event-
ually be made a prisoner he could easily manage
however to manufacture a story of having inadvert-
ently been left behind it would be a matter of greater
difficulty to keep out of sight of the spy who would
imagine himself alone on the isleport scott knew
nothing of the presence of holden who had arrived the

previous night he would not now risk going below to
find out what the austrian was doing so he remained
hidden in a place whence he could command a view of
the ramp

  it was past noon when he espied a figure slowly as-
cending the ramp as the figure came into full view
although at some distance away scott was astounded
to note first the absence of beard then the growing
resemblance not to the austrian but to bob holden
he was on the point of revealing himself when he
caught sight of the austrian slipping around a far
corner of the hotel holden was under surveillance in
the instant of pause occasioned by the sight of the
spy scott did some rapid thinking he knew that the
presence of the austrian boded no good to his friend
and in such a situation he reasoned that ittwere better
for him to remain as a spy upon the spy controlling
himself by an almost superhuman effort he dropped
back into his place of concealment why had bob
holden not left with the planes that morning when
the isleport was evacuated knowing the scientist as
he did he conjectured that his remaining behind must
be related in a definite manner to the impending war
at any rate he would see to it that his friend had
every opportunity to carry on unmolested jerry
scott smiled inwardly over the subtleties of the situa-
tion and the smile ended in a tension of the jaw
muscles as the old fighting instinct reasserted itself
he was at the old game again on scout duty and all
his old time cunning swept over him making every
faculty alert he loved the game with its lure of ad-
venture and he would play it now as never before he
knew that his most arduous duties would be at night
so he slipped through the thickets keeping always con-
cealed until he reached the hotel where he went to
his room and caught a few hours of sleep

he awoke as the light was fading in the early
autumn sky and it was dark by the time he
emerged from the hotel he descended to the second
deck where he secreted himslf a short distanc from the
ramp and waited in about half an hour he heard
footsteps stealthily ascending the ramp from the deck
below and soon saw the broad shoulders of the aus-
trian ascending through the gloom as the spy con-
tinued his ascent to the deck above scott followed
the sound of the waves below served to drown his
footsteps especially as his quarry was also moving
arriving at the fourth deck the spy moved along the
wall of the hotel and entered a door in one of the
wings scott was considering whether or not he would
follow and run the risk of being discovered by the spy
inside for he was uncertain whether the door opened
into a room or a hall when a light appeared through
the drawn blind of a nearby window he passed around
the two outer walls of the room and discovered a blind
not fully drawn through which he could see into the
interior it proved to be the radio-telegraph room and
the austrian was seated at the table operating the
key he was sending a message probably to those
with whom he had been in conference the day they
had stopped at fayal scott withdrew again into the
shadows of the shrubbery soon the light was flicked
out and the spy emerged from the room and slipped
away in the direction of the ramp jerry scott re-
mained for a few minutes in his place of concealment
considering this new development he knew nothing
of radio and must therefore remain unenlightened re-
garding any messages that the spy might send he
wished for bob holden bob was an expert in every-
thing pertaining to radio and might be able to tap any
messages meditating over this he wondered whether
he ought not to go immediately in search of holdens

apartment and enlist his aid he was startled to see
two figures approaching from around the end of the
hotel he was too far distant to recognize them in the
darkness but he knew by the general figure and car-
riage that one of them was holden the other-could
it be a woman had holden married during his ab-
sence he could hardly believe it the companion might
after all be a man but he had no time to investigate
he must follow the spy back on the lower deck he
reconnoitred the situation and as he approached the
motor-launch rendezvous of the spy noted a faint
streamer of light through a crevice in the covering
he crept nearer and peered through a small opening
the austrian was rolling himself up in a blanket on
the leather cushions of the launch two service re-
volvers lay within easy reach then the lights were
switched off his work for the night was over

  scott considered whether it would not be best to
enter and bind his adversary while he slept but he was
unarmed and it would be impossible to enter the launch
in the dark without making some noise he had no
feeling of fear regarding such an unequal combat but
on the whole it was inadvisable to enter into situations
of extreme risk if he would protect holden more-
over he wished to know more of the purposes of the
spy and the designs of those who had placed him on
the isleport he therefore abandoned the idea for the
present

  for some hours he prowled about the isleport steep-
ing himself in the glories of the moon imbued tropical
night a mocking bird woke the echoes in the palm
garden and as the flute-like notes floated from his
silvery throat and trilled off through the waving palms
the night cast its enchantment over him the chill of
early autumn was in the air and the moaning of the
breakers formed a melodious fundamental for the over-
tones of the winged songster a steamer rug that had
been left behind in the precipitate hegira of the morn-
ing caught his eye and stretching himself in a steam-
er chair he wrapped the rug about him and was soon
lost in the fantastic fabric of his dreams dreams not
of war and combat but of laughing blue eyes and
raven hair and of lips that lightly kissed his fore-
head just as he awoke to find the first slanting rays
of the morning sun shining in his face he arose
hastily and slipped cautiously back to his room here
he bathed and shaved and then descended to the hotel
kitchen in search of food

  jerry scott yearned to seek out the quarters of his
friend to sit and talk with him in the old time good
fellowship but when the yearning was strongest
there came to him the thought that the best service
he could render to holden was by keeping relentless
watch over his adversary the situation was excep-
tional for of the four persons on the isleport he alone
knew of the existence of the other three and he there-
fore held the position of vantage ordinarily one does
not watch another of whose presence they know noth-
ing the spy would naturally be on the lookout only for
holden and his companion assuming that he knew
that holden had a companion scott would thus find
it an easier task to watch the spy if he kept himself
separated from holden and his quarters his alleg-
iance to his friend and to the cause of which holden
was the exemplar called up within him an unwavering
stoicism to which the granite of the new england
hills the playground of his early youth seemed to have
contributed something of their essential nature and
after all the pleasures which this lifelong friendship
offered would only be deferred for a short time mean-
while he must watch and wait giving to holden the
opportunity to carry on with the work which had led
him into this voluntary exile

  but in order to carry out his plan scott reasoned
that it would first be necessary to locate holdens quar-
ters then select a room for himsejf so positioned that
he would have a clear view of the entrance to his
friends rooms holden had in the days of their former
association often talked to him about equipping one of
the isleports with laboratories and workshop for the
development of his various experiments and scott dur-
ing the few days he had been there had noted the
circular room and the overhanging wing and had con-
cluded that this was the consummation of his friends
plans holdens apartment would undoubtedly be closely
connected with these rooms and scott had often noted
the door opening upon the area near the fountain he
was at a loss however as to means for obtaining con-
firmation of this view until he thought of the prob-
ability of procuring a room plan of the hotel from the
office with this prospect in view he went to the office
and found the plan he sought each deck plan was en-
closed in a glass covered frame and with them was
shown the two corresponding floors of the hotel on
the plan of the fourth deck he located the outer door
and saw the stairway leading up from it to the eighth
floor and on the plan of this floor he noted the apart-
ment and laboratories which were marked perman-
ently reserved he was certain now that this
was the location of holdens quarters he also noticed
the door at the end of the apartment hallway leading
out into the hotel hall on the same level making his
way up through the hotel to this door he found it
securely locked with a special type of lock not to be
found on any of the other doors of the hotel he re-
turned to the room which he had been occupying and
gathering up his belongings transferred them to the
room he had selected for himself in a projecting wing
of the seventh floor this room was so situated that
it commanded a view of the approach to the outer door
of holdens apartment and he spent the remainder of
the day there reading and watching but the best laid
plans gang aft agley for even as he watched kitty
cromwell was walking into the clutches of the spy
at the opposite end of the palm garden

chapter vi
ravnowickz shows his hand

their second morning on the isleport found bob
holden and kitty cromwell early astir at break-
fast he broached the subject of the spy he
sought to allay any misgivings on her part by recalling
that inasmuch as their own visit to the isleport was
unknown the presence of the spy was therefore not
intended as a menace or threat to them personally yet
he continued it was always better to be prepared for
any emergency and it was but the part of precaution
that they take all reasonable measures against the
hazards of the situation which confronted them cross-
ing the room he opened a small closet and took from a
drawer two revolvers at the same time asking her if
she were familiar with the use of firearms

  she replied that revolver practice had been required
of her while in hospital service during the world war
and that she had attained some proficiency in shoot-
ing at a mark

  that is good he replied and handing her one of
the revolvers he continued i think it best for both
of us to go armed do not leave the room at any time
without this it would be foolish as well as hazardous
to attempt to find our enemy in so vast a place as this
with so many opportunities for hiding besides it
would be better not to arouse suspicion concerning our
knowledge of his presence here i shall feel much
easier knowing that you will have a means of protec-
tion should an emergency arise i shall be busy in the
a modern atlantis



laboratory all day and cannot ask you to make your-
self a prisoner here but first i will go down to the
switchboard and connect it so that a call from any
part of the isleport will come to me direct you will
also find in every hall of the hotel and at various sta-
tions outside an alarm bell and push button by press-
ing one of these buttons an alarm will be sounded all
over the isleport they are used as a danger signal in
case of fire or storm should you ring it i can get
the station where the call was made and will hasten
to you

  after he left she busied herself for a time about
the apartment finally she put on her coat and plac-
ing the revolver in her pocket went out for a stroll
about the isleport instead of leaving by the usual
door however she proceeded to the opposite end of the
hall through the door to which holden had furnished
her with a key and into the hotel hallway finally
emerging from the opposite side of the building out
upon the fourth deck so it happened that jerry scott
who had placed himself in a position to watch the
outer door missed her

  the wind had risen and to the northwest a bank
of storm-clouds rose tier on tier like distant hills
huge rollers were breaking into lines of feathery
foam at thur crests it was an exhilarating sight to
see them coming on and on like the serried phalanxes
of a mighty army to hear them break through the
struts and braces beneath the structure then watch
them as they regathered force and continuity beyond
the opposite side of the isleport gradually the picture
transposed itself in her mind the onrushing rollers
became the ranks of mighty armies seeking to engulf
the work of one man but were broken into fragments
by the creation that his hand and brain had wrought
was the picture prophetic of the results about to be
consummated when the mighty armada now gathering
should be hurled against them looked at with eyes
that had witnessed the devastating effects of war and
the destruction which involved victor and vanquished
alike it seemed hopelessly incredible a few days
would see this marvel of the age either sunk to the
bottom of the ocean or worse still occupied by the
advancing hordes of central and eastern europe she
abhorred war and would willingly lay down her life
that others might live in peace but against all rea-
son all the experience of the past she had faith in
the ability of this man even though he defied the
universe she knew that whatever he had planned to
do would not be done by any of the known agents
of destruction and that it must be accomplished be-
fore the enemy was near enough to retaliate one
shell or torpedo would wreck the thinly armored ob-
servatory or the unarmored isleport

  as these thoughts were passing through her mind
she continued her stroll along the gravelly walks paus-
ing now and then to gaze off across the ocean until
she had reached the farther end of the garden stand-
ing for a moment beside a thicket of shrubbery her
arms were suddenly seized from behind and pinioned
to her sides and she was forcibly propelled into a
secluded spot the admonition spoken into her ear from
behind not to scream or make any noise was unneces-
sary for she inwardly knew that her assailant would
seek to gain information from her rather than to in-
flict upon her any bodily harm she gripped the re-
volver in her coat pocket and it gave her a feeling of
assurance her senses were keenly alert as they stopped
within a sheltering fringe of bushes and the spy faced
her about he wore no mask other than the black
beard that covered his chin and extended well up over
his side face he was about five feet ten inches in
height heavy shouldered and muscular there was

something about his face and build that gave rise in
her mind to a feeling of familiarity a vague sense of
having seen him somewhere before but there was no
time to consider this for he was speaking to her and
she must be alert to win in the game of wits that she
would have to play

  you know me not he said half questioningly but
i too am working with herr doctor von sturm he
hissed his ss he wish that you give me information
concerning herr holden she noted that all his
sentences ended with a rising inflection as if half in
question also that he enunciated with a certain pre-
cision indicative of one who has acquired a language
after the passing of the early and more acquisitive
years a wave of disgust swept over her at the insinu-
ation that he considered her a partner in spying on
holden she made no reply for a moment his insin-
uation must be overlooked even though she appear to
be in league with him in order to protect her friend

  well he said i wait your answer what does he
do in there he pointed to the observatory i have
nothing to report she replied i have been here only
a day and have never been inside of his workshop

  only a day he queried and why did you remain
here when the others all leave she told him briefly
of how they had been inadvertently left behind then
you knew not of the war he knows now is it not
so and why has he not sent a message for tin
flugzeug 

  she did not know whether he intended to trap her
into answering in german or whether it was a mere
slip into his own tongue but she lied bravely he
wirelessed for one but all planes are commandeered
and none are allowed to leave

  this seemed to satisfy him then suddenly he said
i must get into his laboratory the observatory i
would see what he does in there you must help me
you will get his key and make an impression of it in
sealing wax for me she shook her head slowly then
came the thought that she must appear to acquiesce in
his wishes such a course would at least gain for
them some time that will be very hard to do she
said but i will try

  his face hardened and he clutched her arm until she
winced with the pain and he almost hissed as he said
no double dealing with me i know all about you
herr doctor help you when you needed help we will
stand for nothing but loyalty and service you get me
that key or an impression of it today if possible-cer-
tainly not later than tomorrow morning leave it on
that table where you sometimes sit across from the
fountain on the other side of the hotel that is nearer
to your door remember if you double-cross me neither
of you will leave this place alive

  he disappeared into the underbrush as silently as
he had come kitty cromwell continued her walk
around the garden reviewing in her mind her recent
interview where had she seen him before the
upper face had a haunting unpleasant familiarity it
had probably been at dr von sturms where she
had come in contact with many of his friends and
clients the doctors purpose in placing her with
holden was now apparent von sturm was undoubt-
edly an emissary of some of the central european
states and had been supplying them with information
preparatory to the war for some time

the double role in which he had placed her in-
censed her she was a spy the thought was re-
volting but in this capacity she was in a better posi-
tion to serve holden by unmasking the intentions of
the enemy she would use the doctors own methods
against him would use them for the man she admired

above all men she had not comprehended any deeper
feelings respecting him hers was the homage offered
to an ideal holden appealed to her in all the es-
sentials which represented to her mind the attributes
most to be desired in an ideal companion she had
reached that stage in life and experience which rates
mental attainments as paramount to all others that
coterie whom the social set denominated as thinkers
the pseudo-philosophic clique who manufactured a
philosophy to suit the demands of their own existence
who centered their system in the relations of the sexes
and used biology and psychology as a cloak for liber-
tinism-for them the emotions stood in place of the
mind kitty cromwell had thought too deeply about
matters of the heart the emotions about life itself
to treat such matters superficially not that she
adopted the sophisticated pose for she realized that
sophistication in its modern sense had become more
a pose than designation for a true lover of knowledge
which the term originally implied but experience
had taught her that premature advances in the path
of friendship usually presaged an unwarranted pre-
cocity in the manifestations of what passed for affec-
tion it was not that she felt in any sense bound by
conventions for none foresaw more clearly than she
that conventions are short cuts rules of thumb for
the guidance of non-thinking humans they existed
for the purpose of making thought unnecessary but
she also saw clearly that the abrogation of conven-
tions does not and never can establish the intellectual
soundness of unconventional acts she disliked con-
ventions because they were unthinking and therefore
superficial but she avoided the equally stereotyped
anomalism of the social iconoclast

  holdens friendship had therefore appealed to her
as something real his philosophy transcended the re-
lations of sex and found its roots in the broader
human relations to neither of them had there ever
occurred the slightest question as to the status of their
association on the isleport for their relations had
always been on the impersonal plane his treatment
of her was tinged with an inbred consideration ac-
corded to the sex of which his mother would ever re-
main the prototype an old-fashioned dogma if one
should choose so to call it yet one which expresses
a sentiment whose passing may be viewed with regret
whatever therefore had been her attitude when she
accepted the commission which had placed her in her
present situation the constant association with this
man the insight into his thoughts and motives which
had been revealed to her and the conspicuous bearing
of his purposes on the present international imbroglio
all conspired to win her whole hearted allegiance to
him and to the cause he sponsored

  returning in her thoughts to the matter of the key
demanded by ravnowickz she could easily procure a
complicated looking key from several she had already
noticed in a desk drawer take an impression of it
and leave it in the morning on the table indicated by
the spy he would not ascertain the deception until
the following night and by that time anything might
happen if it became necessary she would go to
holden and tell him all then remain with him until
after the battle

  she reentered the apartment by the same route that
she had taken in leaving earlier in the morning it
was now almost noon so she set about preparing a
lunch which she decided she would take on a tray to
holden in the laboratory

after leaving kitty cromwell in the apartment
that morning holden went directly to the tele-
phone switchboard and made the connection which he

had indicated in their conversation he then went
to the laboratory and proceeded with the work he had
planned his workshop comprised two large rooms
situated on opposite sides of a hallway which con-
nected at one end with the hall of his apartment and
at the other with the circular room called the ob
servatory of the two opposite rooms opening on
this hallway one was his laboratory and the other his
instrument and machine workshop the observatory
was a large room also but did not convey the idea
of spaciousness on account of the amount of equip-
ment installed in it in the center of this room was
a pedestal on which an instrument resembling in its
general appearance a sawed-off telescope was mounted
this instrument was raised well into the semi-spherical
dome above the level of the landing deck and was
surrounded by an operating platform situated at such
a height that a man standing on the platform would
have his head and shoulders raised above the level of
the upper deck

  the instrument which bore a superficial resem-
blance to a telescope comprised a barrel devise of some
two feet in diameter and about ten feet in length
and was pivoted in such a manner as to allow it to be
turned in any direction or depressed to any angle of
inclination that might be desired within the limits
imposed by the circular steel wall of the room this
tube was equipped with a series of metallic disks made
of a new metallic element whose discovery was credited
to holden this metal was known as glorium because
of certain reactions to the cathode ray connected
with the glorium disks was a series of high tension
electric apparatus with complicated wiring on one
side of the room was a bank of twenty vacuum tubes
some four feet in height these tubes recalled in
their general appearance the large vacuum tubes of a
high powered radio transmitting equipment but dif-
fered from these in the essentials of their inner con-
struction it was the function of these tubes to
transmute the current furnished them into that form
required for use in connection with the glorium disks
and these in turn when actuated by that particular
form of electric discharge produced the peculiar phe-
nomenon that holden intended using against the forces
of the european alliance

  although originally installed only for test purposes
there was no inadequacy in power or in the general
structure of the equipment with a wind blowing
from fifteen to twenty miles an hour a current was
produced by the generators which was adequate to
the running requirements of the apparatus with a
wind of less force the storage batteries could be used
for additional power if required moreover the cur-
rent would be used only during short periods of time
holden therefore had no misgivings as to the effec-
tiveness of the apparatus as to the distance at which
it would be effective he had made no adequate tests
and had only theory and his own calculations to fall
back upon in addition to this matter of incomplete
test data there were many refinements which it had
been his intention to work out but on the whole
he was not unprepared for the magnitude of the test
so suddenly thrust upon him

  while kitty cromwell was walking about the isle-
port bob holden was giving a final minute examina-
tion to each part of the apparatus testing out its
various circuits and seeking for any possible mechan-
ical imperfections the vernier adjustment to one
of the glorium disks worked hard and stiff releasing
itself with sudden jerks he removed the screw took
it into his workshop and putting it into a small lathe
worked the screw in with oil until it ran smoothly
then reassembled it in its place a ground wire at-

tached to the steel framework of the structure had
become corroded he prepared a new surface and
brazed the wire to it then coated the joint with a
hard wax to protect it from the corroding action of
the salt air

  he worked rapidly and with precision his hands
putting into execution the dictates of his ever active
mind as with artificers of skill there seemed to be
an intangible union between his receptive senses and
his manual power of expression as if his mental ideas
took to themselves outward forms like crystals defining
themselves from the mother-liquor of thought much
of the apparatus had been shaped into its present being
by his own hands and to all of it he had given the
fnishing touches so that it was doubly his own crea-
tion this exercise of his own handiwork was not due
to any refusal on his part to acknowledge the existence
of superior craftsmen but a perfect work must of
necessity involve something of the soul of the artisan
and the delicate balance of forces the perfect homo-
geneity demanded in the functioning of all of its parts
eliminated of necessity the unsympathetic fashioning
of uninspired labor

   the telephone bell rang kitty cromwell had prepared
lunch and wished to serve it in the laboratory the
thought of a few moments of rest and refreshment
captivated him luncheon over he proposed to show her
the mysteries of the circular room the peculiar looking
tube mounted on the central pedestal with its maze of
wires generators and control apparatus excited her im-
agination until her countenance expressed the questions
she would not ask she knew that he would tell her in
due time if he wished to do so he did and the story
lost nothing of interest in the telling

  back in the aeons when the earth was a whirling
mass of gaees thrown out from the sun of such intense
heat that no particle of matter could exist except in a
gaseous state this great ball of gas was infused with
infinite powers the power of electricity the power of
heat and the power of motion as this mass whirled
through interstellar space it slowly cooled and as it
cooled it contracted so that to these other powers was
added the power of compression each minute particle of
gas carried an electric charge and these charged particles
called electrons became associated together under the
great pressure of the cooling mass and formed the atoms
which we now designate as the chemical elements thus
it happened that an atom containing one single electron
became an atom of hydrogen while an atom containing
ninety-two electrons was an atom of uranium and the
atoms of gold iron nitrogen or lead contained various
numbers of electrons between these two figures every
atom of matter therefore contains a definite number of
electrons plus a large amount of the thermal electral
and mechanical forces which endowed the original gas-
eous mass and these forces which were exerted in the
make-up of matter as we now know it are still locked
up in the atom ready to be released by whoever will
find the key to unlock them

 the makeup of matter in the multitude of ita
jl present forms did not stop with the formation
of the atom for atoms either of the same or of differ-
ent kinds again entered into combination forming mole-
cules water for instance is as you know made up
of molecules each of which contains two atoms of
hydrogen and one of oxygen infinitesimal as is the
size of these atoms their electrons circulate within
them with lightning-like velocity and the same thing
b true of each atom in the molecule every mole-
cule is therefore a universe in miniature in which
the atoms represent the solar systems and the electrons
play the part of planets the universe whether we

consider it from the standpoint of the infinitely large
or the infinitesimally small exhibits the same plan
for size is after all only a comparison of an object
to ourselves and has no place in the arrangement of
things when viewed from the impersonal standpoint

   thus far the science of chemistry has had to content
itself with effecting changes in molecular structure
the molecule may be decomposed into its atoms and
these atoms recombined almost at will it is possible
therefore to make perfumes from coal-tar or glycerine
from sewage but in all the changes accomplished by
the chemical industries the atoms remain as they were
originally formed when the world was slowly evolving
into being from its gaseous nebula

   if we lay a piece of wood on the fire the cellulose mole-
cule is decomposed and the carbon and hydrogen atoms
unite with the oxygen of the air but the heat energy
stored up in that stick of wood while its molecules
were slowly forming under the action of years of
sunlight is released in a few minutes the atoms
however remain unchanged merely entering into
new molecular combinations what would happen if
the infinitely greater stores of energy in the atoms
were released the atomic energy in a pound of coal
would run an ocean liner for months possibly for a
year where it now takes the molecular energy of tons
of coal to turn the powerful engines for a single
hour

  there is however another peculiarity of the atom
with which i must acquaint you if the subject is not
getting too boring she signified her interest and
begged him to proceed electricity he resumed in
so far as we know and use it is negative the elec-
trons in every atom are likewise negative but each
atom has a positively charged nucleus which acts like
the sun in our solar system and around it the plane-
tary electrons revolve this nucleus contains a posi-
tive electric charge equal to the negative charges of
all of its planetary electrons combined the electric
charges in an atom are therefore neutralized and
their opposite charges hold the atom together there
is one case of an unbalanced atom known to science
that is the radium atom and it is in a continual
process of decomposition breaking down with little
explosions which throw off some of its original char-
acteristics when an atom of radium has thus exploded
five times flung away five of its electronic charges it be-
comes a substance which is indistinguishable from
lead

  for years this question of unlocking the energy
stored in the atom has interested me as it has many
other scientists if a means could be found for pro-
ducing positive electric energy the forces which now
bind the atom together might be thrown out of bal-
ance thiswould disrupt the atom and release the
energy stored in it the production of such a posi-
tive ray became possible with the discovery of glorium
a substance whose atomic weight shows that it con-
tains ninety-three electrons to each atom and there-
fore a larger nucleus carrying a greater positive elec-
tric charge than any other atom known glorium
atoms like those of radium are unbalanced and i
have found a means whereby they may be disrupted
at will as the atoms disrupt their nuclei shoot out
into the path of a new type of ray this ray has
the shortest wave length known it becomes saturated
with the positive nuclei which are carried along at a
velocity approaching that of light when these nuclei
collide with the atoms of oxygen or nitrogen in the
air the latter are unbalanced and explode releasing
the energy stored in them into the path of the ray
thus the heat and electric energy of the ray is con-
stantly increased no substance can withstand the
a modern atlantis



bombardment of these positive nuclei by means of

it i have been able to dissolve steel nickel-even a

diamond-in an instant of time in its attack on

metals where atoms are closely packed together the re-
action seems to increase in violence even outside of the
path of the ray it is as if one could shoot out mil-
lions of suns of larger size than any of the suns in
celestial space they would not only disintegrate every
other body with which they came in contact but
would disrupt other solar systems outside of their
path by drawing their planets into the path of bom-
bardment

  but she faltered when this power is released
what will happen to the apparatus which generates the
ray and to this isleport and-to us

  he was pleased with her keenness of insight and
replied that is a matter which cost me a great
deal of thought its answer however is not so diffi-
cult as it might seem the enormous disintegration
of glorium atoms it might naturally appear would
soon use up the plates but when one considers the
countless millions of millions of atoms in one square
centimeter of surface and the relatively large size of
the disks winch give off nuclei from their whole sur-
face this feature becomes unimportant there are
several disks in operation at once and the energy
derived from this decomposition is carried off by the
high velocity of the ray it is only when the ray
comes into contact with a dense material that its
terrific destructive force is apparent the energy
then released does not come from the ray but from
the atomic disintegration of the material under bom-
bardment

  the afternoon sped swiftly away as he worked
over the apparatus stopping from time to time to
explain to her some new mystery or to engage her
mind over the intricacies of some device which had
been perfected only after months of untiring labor
sometimes as he talked to her he stroked some piece
of equipment with his hand even as the master strokes
the head of his favorite dog she understood his
feeling for this marvelous creation of his brain and
hand and inwardly smiled at his act of unconscious
devotion

  near the close of the day they locked the laboratory
and returned to the apartment both had come to
look forward to their evenings together in the library
they talked of their varied interests their likes and
dislikes in art music and philosophy of literature and
books and of nature in her multiform expressions
now and then a fleeting shadow crossed her mental
vision as she thought of her interview that morning
with ravnowickz and of the double role she was re-
quired for a time to play but most of our worries
and troubles are caused by the narrow limits which
circumscribe our senses were it possible for some
sense of television to reveal to us the things that are
transpiring just beydnd the horizon of knowledge
our clouds would disappear had kitty cromwell been
permitted to look out that night on the golf course
her shadows would have vanished and her heart would
have thrilled at the sight of the ally who was cham-
pioning the cause in which she felt herself to be
holdens sole supporter

chapter vii
combat

jerry scott arose from a late afternoon nap and
stretched into suppleness the sinewy muscles of
his athletic figure as he looked from the window
of his room the light of a brilliant afterglow was
tinting the facets of the waves into paths of pink and

gold soon the mantle of night would be cast over
the waters and he loved night time with its tranquil
spirit of mystery he was never lonesome at night
for when alone he philosophized and philosophy eval-
uates life interprets the unknown and imparts an
orderly sequence to actions to think alone at night
is to think clearly and to think clearly is a gift en-
joyed by very few to one who stands thus solitary
before the altar of nature removed from the petti-
ness of human intrigue and the subtleties of ambition
there comes a readjustment of perspective born of
the immensity of that macrocosm in which our micro-
cosm moves for such an one philosophy leads to
paths of simplicity unselfishness and wisdom and
it had so transpired that this alchemy of thought
instilled into his soul during his nocturnal rambles
had served to temper the turbulence and impetuosity
of jerry scotts devil-may-care disposition and had
transmuted a predestined vagrant into a character
whose unassuming simplicity and directness had won
for him both homage and love from all who knew him

  but the mellowing effect of years and the fruits of
philosophical thinking had not carried in their train
any relaxation of that masculine virility which was
ever ready to maintain the freedom of his indomit-
able spirit to him the cause of a friend was his
own cause and he knew full well that sooner or later
it would be his privilege to match himself against the
austrian in holdens behalf how or when such a
contest might arise he knew not and cared not to-
night he felt equal to any emergency that might be
thrust upon him he did not intend to force any
issue with the spy but he knew that the austrian
would not delay much longer to strike his blow at
holden

  it was dark as he stepped through the outer door
of the hotel into the palm garden and he paused for
a few moments to give his eyes time to adjust them-
selves to the night he wore a dark colored sweater
in lieu of a coat in order to give himself greater
freedom of action and at the same time make him-
self more invisible groping his way along the hotel
wall h reached the ramp and descended two decks to
the golf course he could see more clearly now but
still only for a few yards ahead his first objective
would be to locate the austrian then keep strict watch
over his movements there was little trouble to be
expected from him by day but by night he must be
on guard especially as the time for the allied blow
drew near

  it will be remembered that number one tee of the
course was located near to the front end of the hotel
and that the fairway crossed a ravine about fifty
yards from this tee the ramp coming up from the
lower deck was situated on the opposite side of the
hotel from this tee coming down from the deck
above scott made a circuit of the hotel in order to
assure himself that the spy had not yet ascended
and as he rounded the bow-like front of the struc-
ture he crashed forcibly into the heavy set frame of
the man he sought both were propelled backward
for an instant by the shock of the collision and there
was a momentary pause during which each gathered
himself together and regarded his antagonist through the
darkness jerry scott was quickest in recovering himself
but he remained alertly poised not wishing to take the
offensive until his antagonists purpose was revealed
then the spys hand leapt from his pocket and scotts
eye caught through the gloom the glint of steel

  jerry scott during his wanderings had picked up
many tricks of offense and defense and among them
were not a few of the famous jiu jitsu system which
had been taught him by a japanese master of the art

to apply one of these was but second nature in such
an emergency before his assailants arm had even
started to straighten out in order to bring his pistol
into firing position scott sprang at him and grasped
the spys right wrist in his left hand at the same
instant his right hand shot out with terrific force
palm outward in such a manner that his palm caught
the back of the austrians pistol hand bending it vio-
lently inward at the wrist which scott held with a
grasp of iron this sudden inward flexing of the
spys hand automatically released his grip on the re-
volver which dropped from his inert fingers even as
it fell toward the deck a lucky kick of scotts right
foot caught it and propelled it through the air into
a distant bunch of shrubbery the infuriated austrian
tried to grapple with him but scott sprang backwards
out of the reach of those powerful arms sensing full
well the strength of his assailant and they faced each
other again on more equal terms

  the spy was a powerful man heavily muscled through
back shoulders and arms his was the muscular sys-
tem of the bear he could crush and break a man
like an eggshell but powerful muscles of this type
are lacking in that pliant elasticity which is a pre-
requisite to scientific self-defense in the coming com-
bat he would depend on his strength brains meant
nothing to him especially when as in the present in-
stance he was enraged his fighting instinct told
him but one thing and that was mastery through
brute force he would certainly underestimate hia
antagonist

  jerry scott on the other hand had muscles of the
pliability of whipcord they were of the active type
of the leopard he was strong but his strength was
dynamic moreover scott was controlled by his brain
rather than by his emotions and he would proceed
intelligently to seek out his enemys weaknesses his
attack would overwhelm by its surprises it would be
varied from moment to moment and each variation
would inflict some new source of pain on the body
of his antagonist finally jerry scott was a prac-
tised and proficient boxer who would waste none of
his stpingth but would make every blow count in
the struggle for ultimate victory

  as the austrian rushed in like an enraged ber-
serker to grapple with his antagonist scott lightly
eide-stepped with the movement of a skillful boxer
and sent a smashing right to the jaw of his antag-
onist but the blow seemed only to anger his assailant
who paused only for an instant and came at him
again swinging his long sledge hammer arms wildly
like flails to the boxer who has learned to lead and
counter with a skillful opponent along the definite
lines laid down for the art of self-defense nothing is
more disconcerting than the untrained movements of
an antagonist who utterly oblivious to the science of
blow and parry uses his arms as clubs to beat down
the guard of his more scientific adversary with a total
disregard of purpose or direction many a profes-
sional fighters hopes have been wrecked in this man-
ner by an unscientific but more rugged opponent
scott knew full well that such a course would rapidly
exhaust the spy and if he could only evade those
club-like blows inflicting meanwhile sufficient punish-
ment to keep the spy enraged victory would ultimately
be his the light was becoming stronger as the moon
neared its rising and the possibility of an accidental
misstep would soon be removed

again and again the austrian rushed at him with
those wildly flailing arms and as often as he did
so scott side-stepped to right or left just in the nick
of time staggering his opponent as he did so with

hard jabs to the head time and again he caught
the spy on a certain spot on the jaw which he had
reason to believe would most quickly and effectually
curtail his opponents power of resistance once as
he side-stepped a powerful swing of his opponents
fist struck and glanced off his left shoulder whisking
him slightly off balance the austrian seeing his ad-
vantage unexpectedly made a dive to catch him round
the legs scott jumped back a fraction too late and
both went down rolling over and over on the grassy
fairway but jerry scott was the quicker and managed
to kick himself free from his opponents uncertain
grasp both were panting as they came to their feet
again for the pace had been terrific and there was
no gong to sound a rest period scott however had
husbanded his strength and his superior strategem
now began to tell in his favor the moment for which
he waited had now arrived and he took the offensive
without giving his opponent a chance to catch his
second wind he rushed in and with the skill of long
practice uppercut through the austrians guard land-
ing a terrific blow on the point of the chin his
timing and placement were perfect and he noted that
his enemys knees sagged but only for an instant
his opponent showed a surprising ability to take all
the punishment scott could give but he knew that the
end was approaching he had learned through past
experience never to exert himself beyond a certain
limit always to have something in reserve for a final
effort and this reserve now stood him in good stead

  during the combat scott had subsconsciously worked
their position down the fairway toward the ravine
this bit of ring generalship was not premeditated by
any definite thought it was intuitively inspired by a
knowledge of the ground and might in case of neces-
sity be used either as offensive or defensive tactics
suddenly he saw through the increasing light the
ravine falling away only a few yards behind his op-
ponent he rushed and his opponent gave ground
step by step as the blows rained over his face and
head blows that lacked power for scott was not
exerting himself now but in every one there was a
sufficient menace the spy now stood within a yard
of the steep bank of the ravine and jerry scott sum-
moned all his reserve power for the final blow feint-
ing with his left to open his opponents guard he
stepped in and as he drove his right home he raised
himself on the ball of his foot swinging his body
from the waist upward into a crashing blow perfectly
timed and directed at just the right upward angle
the austrian was fairly lifted off his feet his hands
dropped and his knees sagged beneath him then he
crumpled up and fell backward over the edge rolling
down over the jagged rocks until he lay limp cut
and bleeding at the bottom of the ravine

  exhausted though he was scott made his way
slowly down the ramp to the lower deck where he
cut a piece of rope from the lashings of one of the
life boats returning he descended into the ravine
and bound the hands of his still unconscious ad-
versary behind him the moon had now risen and
the face of the austrian as he turned it up into the
light was fearfully cut and swollen he ran his
fingers through the beard covering over the jaw and
said as if to himself

  thought i knew you dont usually forget a
face then he seated himself on a nearby rock
lighted his pipe and waited for his captives awakening

  that scott had by this time fully recovered from
his exertion was an evidence of the excellent physical
condition which it was his habit to maintain to a
degree seldom found save in the professional athlete
his life no less than his ideals demanded this for
a modern atlantis



in the varied exigencies of his wandering career he
was often called upon to endure extraordinary hard-
ships he had kept the pace with expert mountain
climbers was a swimmer of no mean attainments
and had joined in the arduous life of big game hunt-
ing in africa it had therefore become to him a
matter of pride as well as satisfaction to ever main-
tain that physical condition which made him second
to none in the emergencies of his adventurous life he
had received no hurt in his conflict with the austrian
save for a slight bruise on his shoulder where the
latter had struck him

  the spy moved and opened his eyes -he made a
futile endeavor to raise his hand to his head then
realized for the first time that his hands were bound
he was dazed and shook his head from time to time
to clear his muddled brain then as the mind gradu-
ally cleared his cunning reasserted itself and he tried
to open conversation with his captor

  a ferry great fighter i could not haf pelief it
in a gentleman of science and a so great student
scott knew that the accent was unnecessary was in
fact an attempt to mislead him the spy evidently
labored under the delusion that his opponent was bob
holden jerry decided not to enlighten him so re-
mained silent and smoked his pipe the austrian
meantime had swiftly concocted his story and resumed
the conversation

  you surprise me i tink i am left all alone on
dis island i stowavay to go to america you tie
me up mebbie you tink i do harm not to you enny
more once try is enuff but tell me why do people
all leaf

  scott was bored by the childish attempt to deceive
him so he knocked out his pipe on the rock put it
in his pocket and said now listen old timer dont
try to bluff me i know more about you than youd
care to listen to you are a spy and came here to
prepare this place - a base for the attack of the
european alliance on the united states the austrian
showed his disappointment and scott continued now
knowing you and your purpose here im going to
take every precaution against your carrying out any
of your plans get up

  he jerked the rope and administered a few light
kicks to his prostrate foe the austrian complied
grudgingly and arose stiffly to his feet placing his
captive in front of him scott prodded him along the
bottom of the ravine to a flight of steps which they
ascended he then conducted his captive in the same
manner to the hotel and into the private office of
the manager here he ordered his captive to lie down
on a couch in which position he bound him to the
couch and left him leaving the room scott closed
and locked the door removed the key and placed
it in his pocket

jerry scott was well pleased with the outcome of
his evenings adventure although he would have
preferred to defer the encounter until the spy had
disclosed more fully his plans or those of the alliance
he felt somewhat perturbed when he considered that
by holding the spy captive he would necessarily cut
off the source of wireless information to the alliance
this might make them suspicious and lead to the
check-mating of holdens plans but there could be
no step backward now he considered going to bob
holdens apartment to consult upon the situation
it was still early in the evening and there was now
no longer need for his remaining in seclusion then
there came to him the recollection of the previous
night when he had seen the spy retiring in the launch
and with this visual reconstitution of the scene he

saw again the two revolvers that the spy had laid
beside him then there came the thought that the
spy might still be armed this thought however
was quickly dismissed for he remembered that he had
on binding the austrian almost subconsciously passed
his hand over his assailants pockets with that military
sense of picaution acquired during his service in
france and which once acquired never deserts one
in an emergency moreover had the austrian possessed
any weapon he had had abundant opportunity to use
it during their encounter scott decided therefore
to have a look at the stowaways retreat

  in the launch he struck a match and located the
switch which turned on a storage battery light then
began a systematic search for the missing weapon
as already noted the austrian had arrived at the
isleport without any baggage but his overcoat lay
neatly folded up on the cockpit cushions and in search-
ing through the pockets of this coat scott found a
billfold containing some papers opening this he
searched through it for any notes or information and
on a sheet of paper he found the message which un-
known to him had been so laboriously decoded by
bob holden and kitty cromwell the message was
given in code together with the key word and decoded
form it was evidently the sheet on which the spy
had worked out his message before going to the wire-
less room to send it it explained much that scott
had before only hazily guessed at the reference to
nurse x was particularly illuminating the woman
then was not bob holdens wife but for some un-
known reason his friend was under the care of a
nurse scott felt that he should go immediately to
holden and inform him of the message but if his
friend were ill or even recuperating from some con-
dition which made excitement inadvisable the meet-
ing should be deferred after careful consideration
he decided that he would not disturb holden that
night there was nothing in the message after all
which could not be reasonably delayed until the mor-
row its purport together with his own appearance
would serve only to excite his friend who would stand
in need of all the rest he could get until the time for
the final test came for scott was certain that holdens
presence boded no good for the cause of the european
alliance he would wait

  finding nothing further of interest in his search of
the stowaways quarters scott returned to the scene of
his early evenings combat and searched for the re-
volver of which he had so dextrously relieved the
spy a half hours careful search of the ground foot
by foot rewarded him and he picked up the weapon
from the spot where it had fallen in some rank grass
beneath overhanging branches it was a service weapon
of the lugger type withdrawing the shell clip he
found it filled and snapping it back into place he
dropped the weapon into his hip pocket

  in the now glorious light of the risen moon he
wandered over the golf course lost in wonder at the
wealth of talent displayed in the layout he stood
on the tees and took fancied swings at an imaginary
ball that caught the moonbeams as it sailed down the
fairways now gloriously lighted by the filtered rays
that distilled beneath the upper deck and through the
leafy paradise he ascended to the landing deck the
better to view the glories of the heavens and watched
as orion climbed the eastern skies and the milky way
like a gigantic skip-rope swung over his head watched
until his restless spirit succumbed to the harmony of
the spheres bringing to him a sense of ineffable peace
and quiet and the memories of nights spent in many
a curious untravelled quarter of the globe he heard
with rupert brooke the calling of the moon and

the whispering scents that strayed about the idle warm
lagoon on such a night had cleopatra met mark
anthony beside the sphinx memory carried him back
to a night when he too had wandered about the the-
ban oracle and like napoleon had visualized the cen-
turies that looked down upon him on such a night
had lorenzo wooed jessica in the gardens of portia at
belmont with those immortal words how sweet the
moonlight sleeps upon this bank on such a night
conrads lord jim had seen the lunar orb hovering
over the red sea like a shaving curled up from a
plank of gold how much of the wealth of history
and literature was indebted to the same moonlight
which now melted from his soul all traces of the con-
flict in which he had earlier engaged all thought of
that greater conflict soon to be launched upon this
mid-ocean paradise the red rays of mars tradi-
tional god of war were tonight dissolved in the re-
fulgence of that nearer neighbor in celestial space
steeped in its peace loving emanescence jerry scott
wandered back to the palm garden where he had spent
the previous night and finding there the discarded
steamer rug wrapped himself in it stretched out upon
a grassy bank and was soon asleep

  he awoke toward morning with a dash of rain in
his face the wind was howling through the palms
and the isleport was almost blotted out in the fury
of the oncoming storm groping his way through the
rain now falling in sheets he reached the door open-
ing into the hall on which his room was located he
entered his room removed his drenched clothing went
to bed and slept until the morning

  when he finally arose the storm continued with
unabated fury making his way downward to the
hotel kitchen he prepared breakfast and after eating
placed hot coffee and sandwiches on a tray for his cap-
tive proceeding through the dining room to the
office he took from his pocket the key to the man-
agers office and was about to unlock the door when
he saw that it was ajar he opened it to find the
room empty

chapter viii
a key and its sequel

it may well be that the philosopher hobbes was right
in his inexorable logic when he reasoned that an
absolute monarchy was the most efficient form of
government certain it is that if one admits his prem-
ises his conclusions follow of necessity that the
rights of individuals are more and more conflicting in
proportion to the congestion of population is undoubt-
edly true and it is for the adjustment of such con-
flicts of rights that we have our elaborate systems of
courts and governments but that such a conflict of
rights inevitably leads toward war a ruthless war
of each individual against every other individual may
reasonably be doubted that war however is the
greatest catastrophe that can befall individuals or na-
tions and is to be avoided at any cost meets with our
heartfelt approval having arrived at this point
hobbes proceeds to demonstrate that the chief func-
tion of government is to prevent war that the most
effectual form of government is that form which most
efficiently operates toward this end and that inas-
much as absolute monarchy is most potent in this direc-
tion it is therefore the ideal form of government and
is to be preferred above all other forms but what-
ever may be our ideas concerning the value of these
conclusions it must be admitted that the effectual
abrogation of war by an individual would certainly
bespeak for such an individual that fealty which has
traditionally been accorded to absolute rulers

  while it must be admitted that for kitty cromwell

the question of this or that type of government as a
panacea for war was not one of any considerable im-
portance in fact it is to be doubted whether such a
question had ever entered her mind yet it was cer-
tainly due to some comparable line of reasoning that
she had evolved her allegiance to bob holden as the
man who she believed was destined to abolish war
for all time but her allegiance to holden the scient-
ist was daily expanding into a more personal interest
in holden the man for between these two there had
sprung into being a comradeship that absorbed with-
out negating the logic that had given it birth with-
out discounting the virtues of the aristotelian logic
it is apparent to all who have struggled through the
dry as bonedust system of the brilliant athenian that
like the much abused platonic friendship of his pre-
decessor it must ever be subservient to the more
dynamic forces of personality and it had so tran-
spired in the daily relations of holden and miss
cromwell that this latter force was rapidly becoming
dominant

  it is moreover one of the happy attributes of per-
sonal interest that beginning in any one of a thou-
sand coincidents it offers unlimited means for de-
velopment through the progressive stages of con-
cord compatibility and congeniality into the rarer
stages of friendship and affection into this royal
road tinged with romance and accentuated by the
jeopardy of their situation bob holden and kitty
cromwell had unconsciously entered and among the
many circumstances which had contributed to thi
elevation of their comradeship none had more effec-
tually conspired to bring about this mutual attach-
ment than their conversations for the art of con-
versation an art which like letter writing is
threatened with extinction in an age when anti-gov-
ernment cocktails bridge and the abrogation of con-
ventions have become the end rather than the incidents
of social intercourse among the intelligentsia is one
which lies at the roots of all human achievement
shorn of its fruits the human race would soon fall
back upon its original atavistic tendencies for while
talking is an ability inherited along with the vermi-
form appendix the thyroid gland and the fissure of
rolando the art of conversation which is based upon
this more primitive acquirement has to do with the
expression of those finer distinctions of thought which
lie at the base of nil human progress

  to the casual observer kitty cromwell may appear
as a non-contributing member to the duologues in
which bob holden usually took the leading part but
inasmuch as conversation requires the incentive of a
persuasive listener possessing broad interests and a
thirst for knowledge she was able to supply the in-
centive which lured him from the habitual taciturnity
in which it had been his wont to hide from the purely
inquisitive

  but the art of conversation is only a representative
art whose ultimate limitations are to be found in
the powers of mental discrimination which underlie
it for it is evident that no expression of ideas may
exceed the ideas themselves and the subtle use of
words to express the finer shades of meaning must
in the final analysis rest in the ability of the mind
to perceive such differences conversation is expres-
sion and just as the musician expresses himself in
the interpretation of a fugue or rhapsody or the
artist puts his thoughts his attitude toward life on
his canvas so the conversationalist must and does
whether he wills it or not express his evaluation of
lifes meanings the question therefore of the value
of conversation resolves itself into the more funda-
mental one of our evaluation of life and this might bo
a modern atlantis



interpreted by seme natural classification which would
certainly include the market value the surface or
superficial value artistic and scientific values such
a classification may be illustrated by the attitudes
of different individuals concerning perchance a flower
let us say an orchid

  to the admirer who attaches his engraved card and
sends by special messenger to the subject of his devo-
tion the orchid is an expression of his adoration and
thoughtfulness because it is the most expensive of
flowers to the woman who decorates herself with
its glories it represents the quintessence of taste and
refinement an outward and very visible sign of what
let us hope is an inward and spiritual grace to the
artist it is a symphony in color tones which defies
his consummate skill to depict as he poises on tiptoe
with bated breath in the effort to caress into life the
delicate tracery of veins and laciness of feathery tex-
ture which lie mellowed in its tinted pulchritude only
the botanist may know the secret of the slippered door
which closes after the entering bee forcing him out
through the cloistered arches at the base in order that
he may in so doing rub his nose against the pro-
truding anthers thus gathering his load of pollen to
be carried to the next flower and so complete the
round of nature in her efforts to reproduce its kind

  there is nothing in the relation of the orchid to
the corsage that is of fundamental value its rarity
designates its market value and its market value
predicates its social prestige but beyond this super-
ficiality orchids have fundamental values which lift
them high in the scale of eminence and it is in the
appreciation of these deeper values that conversation
is lifted out of the chit-chat of social intercourse into
the eminence of an art

  as might be surmised bob holden avoided conversa-
tion of the superficial type and it was this fact that
had caused him to be looked upon as a silent man
immersed in his science and out of touch with the
world but among a select circle of intimates he was
known as a brilliant conversationalist when stimulated
by a responsive environment

  kitty cromwell had received a liberal education
which had been augmented by an unusual breadth of
experience her training had contributed to her well
balanced mind a scientific viewpoint which was deep-
ened by a natural instinct to prefer the real to the
semblance one of emersons illuminating gems of
thought tells us god gives to every man the choice
between truth and repose choose whichever you will
you cannot have both and she had long ago made her
choice her thirst for knowledge could never be satis-
fied but it was not the thirst of the scholar who
spends a life-time on some one of the insignificant
problems of being but that type of desire which sees
in every thing a mystery to be unravelled a new
beauty to be unfolded life itself was ever an inter-
esting adventure and its disappointments of which
she had had a full share had not sufficed to disillusion
her much less to cast her upon the rocks of cynicism
or despair while possessed of a happy disposition
she was not of the polyanna type for she had seen
too much of life to believe that there was good in
everything rather she sought reality whether good
or evil and once convinced that a thing was not worth
while she merely aiiminated it from her field of in-
terests it had been impressed upon her during her
early life that happiness must come from within that
it was not so much a matter of the things one possesses
as it was our reaction to the things which make up
our environment a life of unalloyed happiness is a
chimera for happiness like gold must be alloyed with
baser metals to make it enduring

  to say however that bob holden found in kitty
cromwell that type of character which offered a
natural complement to his own would smack of an
idealism for which life with its babel of purposes
offers no justification both were individuals who had
reasoned clearly upon the experiences which life had
brought to them and from the lessons learned had
developed a pragmatism which in the intimacy of their
present associations offered a common ground where
the flowers of their companionship might flourish

dawn of the day following that on which rav-
nowickz had met kitty cromwell in the garden
came reluctantly with a slow gray penetration of light
through clouded skies and a steady down-pour of rain
the wind shrieked and howled through the structure
and the sea was lashed by the tempest into a white
foaming fury it was the same storm-that earlier had
driven jerry scott from his bivouac in the palm gar-
den to the shelter of his room

  bob holden and kitty cromwell had talked late
on the preceding night and the gray stormy day was
not conducive to early rising he knew moreover that
no apprehensions concerning the impending attack need
worry them until after the storm had passed he
stepped from his room into the library to find that
miss cromwell had preceded him and that breakfast
was ready to serve a half hour later he lighted his
pipe and left for the laboratory there was not much
to be done there now except to wait but he was al-
ways more at ease when surrounded by the para-
phernalia of the realm over which he ruled

  as soon as he left the apartment kitty cromwell
went to the desk and began to rummage through a
drawer that was used as a receptacle for a variety of
knick-knacks from it she selected a complicated look-
ing key taking a small block of wood procured from
a box in the store room she smeared one of the sur-
faces with sealing wax heated in the flame of a
candle and while the wax was still soft pressed the
key into it producing a clear impression of its sur-
face grooves and notches she took pains to make the
impression as clear as possible and in every way
strove to carry out the instructions of the spy to the
letter in order to deceive him into a complete ac-
ceptance of her role as accomplice the impression
was to be sure of no value but would she felt be
instrumental in postponing any action on his part for
at least another day then she donned a slicker and
souwester procured from a closet and leaving the
apartment made her way out into the palm garden
as she left the shelter of the hotel to cross the open
area by the fountain the wind almost swept her from
her feet but she continued her way with care clinging
at times to any support that offered as the gusts
of wind tore at her finally she reached the shelter
of the trees deposited the block on the table indicated
by the spy and returned across the storm swept area
to the apartment here she removed all traces of
her wet garments set the room in order and spent
the remainder of the morning in reading looking out
of the windows from time to time to see if the storm
showed any signs of abating

  holden responded to her call for lunch he told
her that during the morning he had been down to the
pump room and had raised the isleport higher above
the waves which had increased with the violence of
the wind this he told her he had intended doing
in any event as they would be able to see an ap-
proaching fleet at a greater distance he was cer-
tain that the storm would prevent any attack while
it lasted but should the skies clear during the day
they might look for the air fleet on the following

morning they would naturally figure on making the
crossing directly after such a blow depending on a
succeeding season of fair weather continuing he
said i have been in the habit of locking myself in
the laboratory and now that there is an enemy on the
isleport this course seems doubly warranted but one
thing has been troubling me that is i might have
one of the old attacks and you would not be able to
reach rae

  he went to the desk and opening the drawer selected
a key which he handed to her saying as he did so
here is a key to the hall leading into the laboratory
quarters keep it with you for use in an emergency

  as she took it her heart almost ceased to beat and
she paled visibly by one of those coincidences which
seem ever at hand to tangle the ways of life into a
mystic maze of uncertainty he had handed her the
identical key from which she had that morning taken
the impression he noticed the change come over her
and offered her a chair but kitty cromwell had been
schooled to action she had a keen perception of a
crisis and knew that nothing could be gained in such
a situation by waiting mutely for the blow to fall
holden might learn that she had betrayed a trust but
he must at all events be warned against the conse-
quences of her rash act dashing across the room she
took the slicker and souwester from the closet and
put them on saying as she did so please wait here
until i return i have something of the greatest im-
portance to tell you

  he watched her in puzzled
bewilderment as she ran from
the room then followed her to
the outer doorway but made
no effort to stop her he
watched her as she crossed
the stormswept area and en-

tered the woods beyond and still stood waiting anxiously
for her return

  she reached the table only to find that the block
of wood that she had placed there a few hours before
was gone then with faltering steps and downcast
bearing she returned she uttered no word as he fol-
lowed her into the library then a great weariness
seized her and she dropped limply into a chair and
said to think that i should have even unwittingly
betrayed you

  he saw that she was deeply moved but could not
comprehend the reason surely she must be laboring
under some delusion then she told him all how she
had unconsciously been the tool of dr von sturm

of her meeting with ravnowickz on the
previous day and of her resolve to de-
ceive him with a counterfeit key in
order to gain time as she finished
her head sank in her arms and her
body shook with sobs

holden came to her where she sat
and taking her gently by the shoulders
raised her from the chair turning her
as he did so until she faced him then
he slowly tilted her chin upward until
she looked into his eyes and said with
a smile suffusing his face kitty
cromwell you have never betrayed a
trust stop worrying for there is no
harm done by telling me all you
have cleared your own actions of any
blame or doubt we will go to the lab-
a modern atlantis



oratory and put another lock on the door i have one
that i will guarantee against this ravnowickz no matter
how clever or ingenious he may be we are going to out-
wit this spy and those who are behind him but do not
venture out on the isleport alone again

  her face flushed and the tears stood in her eyes as
she thanked him for his confidence and the courage
he had given her to carry on then they went to-
gether to the laboratory and added the lock to the
door in his company her spirits returned and the
troubled look gradually left her about mid-after-
noon the rain ceased and the sun broke through the
clouds and as they witnessed this transformation of
nature the last traces of the clouds that had cast
their shadows within were swept away

  how could they know that the lock was an unneces-
sary precaution that her fears had all been groundless
for less than a stones throw away jerry scott sat
in his room wrestling hour after hour with the mys-
tery of a block of wood containing a wax impression
of a key which had been deposited by holdens nurse
on a table in the palm garden in the midst of a tor-
rential rain

chapter ix

ravnowickz

when jerry scott left the spy bound and
locked in the inner office of the hotel he did
not reckon with the craftiness or ability of his
antagonist reasonable consideration of the man whom
the european alliance had chosen for so important
an enterprise as that entrusted to ravnowickz would
have indicated that the spy was a man of unusual re-
sources his defeat of the spy in personal combat
had led the usually cautious scott into underesti-
mating the sagacity and ability of his captive a state
of mind which has too often caused the downfall of
the best laid plans to men whose lives have been
spent in outwitting the forces of law and order and
to whom captivity is a menace ever lurking in the im-
mediate offing reflection aided by a little practice pre-
sents a multitude of expedients for release from what-
ever form of durance is imposed upon them alex-
andre dumas relates how the due de beaufort told
his jailer that he had often thought what he should
do in case he were put into prison and that he had
found out forty ways of escaping

  for one of such resources as those with which the
spy was endowed no form of restraint presents less
difficulties of escape than that of binding the wrists
and feet with cords for reflection in an analytical
manner will demonstrate that in order to overcome that
restraint imposed by this form of bondage it is neces-
sary only to obtain the freedom of one hand complete
freedom is then only a matter of the use of the free
hand in undoing the remainder of the bonds the
annals of criminology are replete with instances of
men who by dint of constant practice from the flex-
ible years of early childhood have acquired the ability
to fold up the hand laying the thumb over the palm
until it flattens along the line of the little finger in
such a manner that the hand becomes as small in com-
pass as the wrist under such circumstances a bond
placed about the wrist when loosened slightly by work-
ing will allow the hand to be withdrawn a more
sure method of binding is to bind the elbows close
to the sides of the body then bind the forearms and
wrists one in front and the other in back of the
body in such a manner that even though the bonds
were loosened the hands could not be withdrawn but
jerry scott was not versed in the ways of the law-
breaker and had not considered the possibility of his

captives escape the famous houdini had developed
this trick to such marvelous perfection that handcuffs
which apparently fitted closely over the wrists offered
no obstacle to the withdrawal of the hand when folded
up in the manner described

  with the checquered career of ravnowickz we are
not concerned except to note that this trick was one
at which he was an adept and that it had stood him
in good stead on numerous occasions no sooner had
scotts footsteps died away after he had locked the
door of the room in which his captive lay bound than
the spy began the slow straining at the ropes which he
knew would eventually gain him his freedom but in
binding the spy scott had used the sailors square knot
which does not loosen under strain any flexibility
obtained must be through the gradual stretching of
the hempen fibre fully two hours had passed before
he felt the pressure of the rope sufficiently relaxed to
begin the painful process of withdrawal his right
wrist had swollen under the impact of the blow de-
livered by scott when he had disarmed the spy at the
beginning of their encounter but while the sprain hin-
dered him greatly in his efforts it also worked indirectly
to his advantage for the swollen wrist had prevented
the rope from being drawn into as small a circum-
ference as that about his uninjured wrist and once
the strain of the rope was relaxed about this injured
member the process of withdrawing the hand was
facilitated with the freedom of his right hand accom-
plished he rested for a time working his fingers and
hand to restore circulation in them before attacking
the remaining bonds with one free hand the final
extrication from his fetters was a matter requiring
only a short time the only bar to his freedom now
lay in the locked door he felt certain that his captor
would not return before daybreak and as the room
was an inner one devoid of windows he followed round
the walls in the darkness until he arrived at the door
he had noted the position of the push-button for
the lights when scott had made use of it the night
before and found it without difficulty the room
was an oblong one of the size of an ordinary office
and contained a desk a table couch and chairs a
large safe was built into an alcove its door even with
the wall of the room he considered hiding himself
in the safe in the hope that when his captor came
and found the room empty he would go away and 
leave the room unlocked but on second thought he
realized that the man whom he thought of as holden
would quickly reason that he had not left the room
and would institute a thorough search for him he
did not care again to engage in a combat with one
who had already proven himself more than his equal
for he had gained a wholesome respect for the athletic
prowess of the man he had encountered the previous
night he crossed the room to the door and made a
careful examination of the lock it was evidently a
high grade of the mortised lock type not of the tumbler
or night latch variety it must be locked or unlocked
with a key and his adversary of the previous night
had taken the key with him it would be an interest-
ing study for those practical savants of psychological
thought to determine the effect of ones early vocation
on the tendencies of later life ravnowickz had in early
life been a locksmiths apprentice a calling which opens
into two avenues only slightly divergent at their begin-
ning but widening as they proceed until their direc-
tions become opposite it is one of those few trades
wherein too great skill is an almost certain menace
both to society and to the individual that plies it the
japanese have a maxim to the effect that a perfect vase
was neer turned out from a poor potters wheel
while americans claim that a good workman can use

a poor tool in the absence of tools ravnowickz fell
back on the american aphorism first he searched
through the desk in the hope of finding a duplicate
key but finding none his practiced eye fell upon
a long metal pin affixed to a base and used as a file
for papers it could be bent to serve the purpose the
bending was accomplished by inserting the point in the
crack left by the desk drawer until it resembled the
form of a skeleton key with this implement he set
to work upon the lock it was a slow process for it
was necessary to feel out with great delicacy the inner
structure of the lock changing the form of the bends
from time to time in order to conform the instrument
to the work to be done but at last he succeeded in
lifting the dog which locked the bolt in place and at
the same time he threw the bolt sufficiently to keep the
dog displaced then the bolt was turned back and the
door was opened he was free

  ravnowickz knew that he must seek a hiding place
where he could while remaining himself unseen
command a view of the approaches first however
he descended cautiously to the motor launch and
secured the revolver which he had hidden for safe
keeping in a small receptacle beneath the motor
placing this in his coat pocket he took his overcoat
and some food from the stores in the launch and
passing through the pump and compressor rooms came
to the mechanicians bunk room on the lower floor
of the hotel this was a large room used as a
sleeping and lounging room for the crew of me-
chanics which under the regular routine of the
isleport had charge of the repairs and equipment it
resembled somewhat the forecastle of an old-time
sailing vessel having the bunks arranged in tiers
along the two sides of the room selecting an upper
bunk at the far end of the room commanding a view
of the door he climbed into it and was soon asleep

jerry scott displayed a crestfallen countenance
as he stood in the doorway of the room where he
had left his captive bound on the previous night he
noted the loosened knots and ropes and realized that
he had to deal with a man of unusual dexterity the
work was by no means that of a novice and by what
means the spy had succeeded in freeing himself from
his bonds scott was at a loss to know inasmuch as
the spy had undoubtedly possessed himself of the other
revolver it would be dangerous to attempt his recap-
ture it was better therefore to act on the defensive
and take every possible means for protecting holden
from the austrian the spy would now have an addi-
tional incentive for action against his friend inas-
much as he labored under the delusion that it was
holden who had made him a captive the night before
scott had counted on revealing his presence to holden
this morning but now as on a number of previous
occasions during the past few days another obstacle
had arisen to prevent it his role clearly called upon
him to retain his position as an unknown

  he returned the tray on which was the breakfast
he had brought to his whilom captive to the hotel
kitchen then ascended through the hotel to iis room
the storm was raging without so he pulled his chair
alongside one of the windows where he could read and
at the same time keep an eye on the entrance to
holdens quarters for a time he was engrossed in
watching the sheets of rain as they swept across the
open area near the fountain he had sat there for an
hour or more when he saw a figure in oil skins emerge
from the door and cross the open area he knew by
the movements that it was a woman and must there-
fore be the nurse she passed out of sight among
the trees but soon returned and reentered the building

he wondered what mission could have led her to ven-
ture out in such a storm it evidently must be a mat-
ter of great importance he decided to investigate so
putting on his storm coat he passed through the hotel
and slipped out of the opposite side of the building
then around the end beneath the overhanging ob-
servatory crossing the open area he entered the
woods and was passing a table when he espied a
block of wood apparently recently placed there for it
was not rain soaked picking it up he discovered on
the under side an impression of a key clearly defined
in sealing wax here indeed was a new complication
holdens companion had evidently placed the impression
there for some one that it was not for bob holden
was certain equally certain that it was not for him-
self inasmuch as his presence was unknown to any-
one for whom was it then except for ravnowickz
he was loathe to believe that holden had a spy in his
own camp yet there was the evidence and try as he
would he could not deny it he now understood the
reference to nurse x in the code message she was
known to the austrian and his coworkers by this
symbol moreover she had undoubtedly been in com-
munication with the spy the situation had suddenly
become extremely complicated there was a spy within
and a spy without and it would devolve solely upon
him to keep them separated to prevent any communica-
tion between them he regretted now that he had
not taken greater pains to incarcerate the spy more
securely to prevent their communication meant a
relentless watch over one of them at least and in the
circumstances it would be easier to watch the spy
thus there was forged another link in the chain of
circumstances that would keep him from revealing
himself to his friend bob needed him now as never
before and the cause of america needed him he
pictured to himself the intrigue which had placed this
woman near to holden to report on his every action
and he wondered how much she knew of his experi-
ments and of the plans he had consummated to thwart
the enemy he felt certain that since that night when
he had seen the spy enter the wireless room no
further messages had been sent following the send-
ing of that message he had shadowed the spy to the
launch and on last night had made him a captive in
all probability ravnowickz had been on his way to
the wireless room last night when they met on the
golf course it was possible to be sure that the
spy had sent a message after he had broken his cap-
tivity early that morning scott doubted this how-
ever his escape had been a matter which had un-
doubtedly occupied him for some considerable time
then the thought came that the spy might have had
assistance but this was discarded as improbable for
it was not possible for the nurse to have known of
the captivity of her ally

  jerry scott spent the remainder of that day in his
room shortly after noon he was surprised to see the
nurse emerge a second time from the doorway and
again cross the open area only to return a few min-
utes later he could not from where he sat see bob
holden who stood a little back from the open door
scott was infuriated at what he thought to be the
deception of this woman he again donned his coat
and hat and made his way out into the palm garden
to the table where he expected to find some message
for the spy but he found nothing he searched the
surroundings but the search was unavailing so he re-
turned to his room he was nonplussed to account for
this second appearance it did not fit in with any ra-
tional explanation why should she have made that
second trip through the storm unless-yes that was
it she wanted to be certain that the spy had taken
a modern atlantis



the block with the key impression she was afraid
that possibly holden might discover it he took the
block from his pocket and examined it more closely
then he went out into the hall and up to the next floor
finally stopping before the door that opened from the
hall of holdens apartment into the hotel hallway the
door was securely fastened he doubted if it were ever
used he compared the key impression with the lock
on the door but found no similarity the key was
that of a complicated form of tumbler lock while that
required for the door was of a different type he
next went back to his room and putting on his coat
and hat went out and around the hotel to the outer
door to the apartment here he made another com-
parison as to the key but with like results the key
impression must therefore apply to some door within
the apartment probably to the door into the labora-
tories the spy evidently had a means of ingress
through the outer door or it would be opened for him
from within well he and not the spy had the pat-
tern of the key

  with the coming of night scott put on his sweater
and sallied forth he crossed the open area to the
edge of the palms and placed a bench under a conveni-
ent cover of overhanging shrubbery this afforded him
an unobstructed view of the door across the open space
where he could see without being seen the rain had
made the air damp and chilly so he returned to his
room and procured a steamer rug to wrap about him
the ocean had subsided with the falling of the wind
and he noticed that the isleport rode higher above the
rollers could this be the result of some automatic
provision that raised it above the reach of the storm-
tossed waves or had it been raised by holden for
some other purpose the attack he felt certain was
near at hand and holden was unquestionably taking
every precaution and making final preparations for his
master stroke against the militant forces of europe

the night dragged slowly along occasionally the
chirrup of a cricket waked the echoes of the wood
or a bird stirred uneasily in the branches jerry
scott breathed with deep regularity but he was not
asleep through his stream of consciousness trouped
the images of the past the scenes of war and the
friendships of peace mingling incongruously in the
stream as it carried on now he drifted over a tropic
isle to the whirring beat of an airplane propellor
anon he painted he often painted in his dreams and
semi-conscious visions and always it was the head
with the winsome blue eyes and the raven hair but
just as he tried to catch the elusive charm it faded
and vanished he was not asleep but he had learned
the art of jungle rest-rest that leaves the mind tuned
to arouse the body at the subconscious perception of
danger the moon had risen behind banks of fleecy
clouds and barely lighted the wall of the hotel wrap-
ping it rather in a dark gray mysteriousness which to
eyes unaccustomed to the darkness would have been
black as erebus

  suddenly he raised himself on his elbow and peered
through the shelter of his leafy bower automatically
his hand drew the revolver from his pocket a dark
shadow was gliding stealthily along the wall pausing
from time to time to listen then slipping along again
with noiseless tread before the door to holdens
quarters it paused and knelt before the lock then
he saw the clear round ray from a pocket flash light
at intervals he could hear a faint rattling as of a key
or tools he considered taking a pot shot at the spy
it was war but his sportsmans instinct revolted at
the thought of shooting a man in the back then too
he wondered if the nurse would appear to hold mid-

night converse with her ally he would wait and see
a window above and to the right of the door opened
stealthily scott could hardly repress the feeling of
indignation that boiled within him they would meet
these two in order to plot against his friend well
he would see to it that there was not much plotting
done he leveled his revolver at the spy then on
the stillness of the air a shot rang out he watched
the would be house breaker as he fled precipitately
around the end of the hotel through the overhanging
archway then he saw through the open window a
room suddenly flooded with light and heard a womans
voice answering to holdens call dim in the distance
he saw a figure in dressing gown cross the room and
open the door and he knew that it was the nurse who
had fired at ravnowickz

  jerry scott had an analytical mind those con-
clusions often attributed to the much overworked
faculty of intuition came to him in a far more logical
manner thus it had transpired that of the various
events taking place on the isleport he had arrived at
the true significance of all save in the one matter of his
classification of kitty cromwell as an ally of the aus-
trian his error in this one instance was but natural
and was therefore pardonable and all the more so
in that he had never seen her face nor had any com-
munication with her for it is harder to misjudge those
we know than those who are strangers to us it is
possible that a more intimate knowledge of feminine
psychology would have caused him to hesitate before
forming any conclusion however sustained by appear-
ances in his favor however be it said that in his
varied wandering career he had probably seen more
of woman at her worst than at her best yet he had
never become convinced of the justice of the kipling-
esque version to say the least he was now in a
quandary he felt that somewhere his analysis had
slipped a cog it was obviously unreasonable that the
same woman who earlier in the day had provided
an ally with a key should shoot at him when he at-
tempted to pick a lock yet these were the facts which
demanded an explanation and try as he might he
could find no solution to the riddle that the nurse
was aware of the identity of the man at whom she
had fired could not be doubted as so far as she knew
the austrian was the only person on the isleport
with the exception of herself and holden in the
light of the earlier experiences of that day the shoot-
ing was deliberately incongruous from the standpoint
of the shooting why had she provided him with the
impression of the key there certainly must have been
some earlier collusion between them but summing up
all the evidence the affair of the key was decidedly cir-
cumstantial while the shooting was a fact the obvious
intention of which it was impossible to deny in fair-
ness to her therefore he must take the shooting as
an indication of her real attitude toward the spy this
view made his own work easier and gave to him a
greater peace of mind

  with this problem settled even though it lacked a
reasonable explanation he rolled the blanket about
him and stretched himself upon the bench he would
remain there for a few hours to see if anything further
happened and if not would go to his room in his re-
action to the excitement and the lightening of his
burden of anxiety for holden he soon found rest and
sleep it was nearly morning when he rose from the
bench and sought his bed long before that hour
some twelve hundred miles to eastward the camp of
the enemy was astir and the plateau which he had
viewed from a distance a few days before resounded
with the whir of planes the attack on america was
under way

chapter x
exit-ravnowickz

morning dawned bright and clear all traces
of yesterdays storm was banished in the danc-
ing sunbeams of a new day the rollers having
spent themselves in their mad race now came in steady
succession grouping themselves in triads with slightly
lengthened pauses between group and group the
birds sang in the trees and nature was bathed in
peace

  breakfast on the isleport in the apartment holden
and kitty cromwell talked on the spy and his mid-
night escapade cant see how i missed him she said
but he certainly had a surprise lock-picking must be
a favorite occupation with him i wonder that he even
asked for a key impression to the laboratory

  it is as well that you missed him replied holden
for it will be a lesson to him even though we are at
war it seems rather personal to kill a man when not
in the heat of battle you see i am not much of a
killer i know that i shall have plenty of it to do but
my war experience was not on the fighting front

  i hate it all she answered but i know that the
success of your plans will never be assured until this
ravnowickz is put beyond the power to do you harm
for the ultimate success of the thing you would do i
would gladly kill him

  in his upper bunk in the mechanicians room the
subject of their conversation lay nursing a slight flesh
wound in his left hand where a bullet after perforat-
ing his cap and missing his head only by the fraction
of an inch had halted the application of his lock-pick-
ing prowess he was angry but had he known who
fired the shot the vials of his wrath would have
choked him as he munched the remnants of food
secured from the locker of the launch

  in the hotel kitchen jerry scott wrestled with the
enigma of a shot fired by one whom he had only yes-
terday accounted as an ally of the spy while he
busied himself in the exercise of his culinary skill

  breakfast over bob holden insisted that miss
cromwell accompany him into the laboratory he
would not allow her again to run the risk of meeting
their enemy moreover he felt that this day would
bring about the culmination of that for which they so
anxiously waited they had been in the observatory
but a short time when a small buzzer attached to a
microphone detector announced the distant approach
of airplanes holden stepped to the small table on
which the microphone rested and adjusted a pair of
head-phones to his ears he slowly turned a dial and
presently announced the approach of a fleet of several
planes from the east in some twenty or thirty min-
utes they would be in sight

  with the same calm assurance that she had noted
in his actions on the day he had saved the isleport
from sinking he now set about making the final
preparations for his master stroke against the king-
dom of mars he threw a switch that started a motor
and slowly and steadily she saw the great leaves which
formed the semi-spherical dome open and roll aside
folding themselves downward into the sides of the
room until the entire top was opened to a level with
the landing deck still other switches turned on series
of turbines in the tubes which were not ordinarily
used for the routine power requirements until the en-
tire power equipment of the isleport was running and
available for use in the positive ray he next turned
the current through the bank of vacuum tubes ad-
justing it until they showed just the right uniform
flow watching as he did so a number of meters in
order to obtain the necessary balance and steadiness

again she noted that his hand often lingered on some
piece of apparatus caressing it as she had often seen
soldiers stroke some favorite rifle or machine gun in
mute expression of their faith in and reliance upon the
implement of destruction

  the wind was blowing steadily from the north-
east and the isleport had swung with it so that the
bow-shaped end of the hotel and the circular room
faced in that direction the cable which attached the
isleport to the buoy was augmented by an additional
cable from each end of the isleport to the buoy by
taking up on either of these auxiliary cables by means
of a winch the structure could be swung so as to
quarter the wind in the present position however
the attacking planes coming from the direction of the
azores would approach the isleport at an angle of
about forty-five degrees from the long side of the
structure

  with everything tuned for the impending attack they
waited listening from time to time to the advancing
planes with the head-phones suddenly he took her by
the hand and led her back into the laboratory where
he gathered up an armful of coats and blankets we
will need these he said for it will be cold the ac-
tion of the ray draws the heat from the surrounding
air into its path near to the point where it meets
with a dense material the heat would be intolerable but
that will be far away

  back again in the observatory they mounted the op-
erating platform he explained to her the simple
method of sighting the tube and showed her the pedal
which when pressed downward connected the power
through a series of rheostats to the tube for great
distance or increased power the pedal should be
pressed clear down she wondered vaguely whether it
would work it was all so involved yet so simple in its
operation it was hardly more revolutionary however
than his isleport scheme must have appeared when
first proposed and her confidence in him was supreme

  then far away to the eastward a speck floated out
of the gray for an instant into the sunlight under
ordinary circumstances it might have been a ray of
sunlight flashing from the white wings of a gull
holden picked up a pair of binoculars focussed them
then slowly swept the heavens from side to side paus-
ing at intervals as he did so his hand showed no
slightest tremor but his voice vibrated with something
more akin to eagerness than excitement as he passed
the glasses to her saying it is the first squadron of
scout planes-ten in all

  little by little the planes emerged from the eastern
sky taking on more definiteness of form as they did
so on and on they came until their arrow-like forma-
tion was distinguishable like a flock of wild geese
they flew to right and left of their leader each
plane stepped back in order to those ahead room
for change of speed or direction without the pos-
sibility f mishap

  holden had once hunted partridges in the north-
west and had learned that a flock treed at dusk may
all be bagged if the lowest bird is picked off first then
the next higher by this means the falling of a bird
from the tree does not disturb the other birds above
it it had been his intention to take the leading plane
first but by some peculiar operation of the sub-
conscious mind this hunting experience now came to
mind he would let the leaders come on without any
knowledge of the fate of those behind

  they were flying at an altitude of about three thous-
and feet and had reached a distance of nine or ten
miles from the isleport when he suddenly sprang into
action sighting the tube at the outermost plane on
the left of the fan shaped line he stepped on the
a modern atlantis



dlvlio of airplanes scott mounted the pedestal and in an instant kitty cromwell

y h not onff to wait    jerry scott marvelled at the silent destruction that followod a rapid succession of flashes

pedal the air about them was filled with an acrid
ozonizing odor a path of faintly violet tinted light
reached out from the tube in the direction of the dis-
tant plane out where the plane had been there was
a soundless flash and a patch of white smoke drifted
lazily on the wind like a small feathery cloud but the
place of the winged messenger of war was empty
there was no falling of debris no buckling of wings
or stays just an instantaneous change of matter back
into the original gases from which aeons ago it had
been formed

holden hardly waited to note these effects he
saw only that the plane had vanished then swung
the tube to the other end of the line to catch the plane
farthest in the rear there was no instant of wait-
ing no moment between action and result simultan-
eous with the pressure on the pedal came the flash
the puff of white smoke and the space where a mo-
ment before a mighty bird had flown was a void

  on and on came the squadron and as they came
holden swung the tube from side to side with noise-
less precision and deadly accuracy with each swing
came the pressure of the foot the flash and puff of
smoke the leaders were unaware of the fate of those
following their eyes were fixed on the tranquil ap-
pearing isle ahead their thoughts conjured up no
vision of the destruction awaiting them on and on
they came and as they came they vanished one by
one until the leader alone was left suddenly the
pilot had a premonition of something wrong and looked
around he was all alone had he outdistanced his
comrades he banked his plane wheeling to right but
too late came the pressure on that pedal and the
sky was clear save for some little patches of white
smoke that marked the effacement of the squadron

  the conflict had lasted but a few minutes but
during its progress there had come an ever increasing
draught of cold air as the heat from the surrounding
atmosphere was drawn into the path of the ray in
the excitement of the conflict they had failed to notice
the benumbing cold but now holden grabbed a
blanket and wrapped it about her and put on a heavy
jacket and gloves all about them the isleport had
taken on a coating of hoar-frost but with the cessa-
tion of the ray there came with equal suddenness the
melting of the frost in the warm rays of the sun

the allies had made thorough plans for their coup
against america landing fields had been con-
structed both on fayal and st michaels and immense
stores of oil petrol and other supplies had been gath-
ered tank boats were already on their way with
supplies for the isleport base the work had been
carried on as already noted under the guise of
agricultural developments with the inauguration of
war a thousand planes had set out from various parts
of europe for their point of mobilization in the azores
in the plans of the european alliance isleport num-
ber two was a key position of the highest importance
since the record breaking flight of colonel charles a
lindbergh in  there had been hundreds of sim-
ilarly successful crossings but there had also been
numerous disasters the use of large many-motored
planes however had made the passage relatively safe
but until the launching of the isleport enterprise the
problem of fuel carriage had been one of the greatest
obstacles in the matter of the attack now to be made
on america a mid-ocean base was of paramount im-
portance it would be necessary to send out several
divisions of planes each day which after bombing the
seaboard cities would return to their isleport base to

replenish their store of ammunition and fuel not less
than a thousand planes would be thus engaged but it
was a foregone conclusion that many of these would be
lost and a constant source of replacement must be
provided the european alliance had mobilized five
thousand planes for this purpose which were distrib-
uted thus a thousand on the fighting front another
thousand in the azores and the balance to be drawn
on as needed from the reserves in europe

  on the third or fourth day after the first attack
on the seaboard cities a combined air and naval at-
tack would be made on new york the reduction of a
few cities such as boston new york philadelphia and
washington it was thought would bring about a hasty
armistice and peace in order to launch the attack
the planes were to leave the azores for isleport num-
ber two in the following order first a squadron of
ten scout planes to prepare the isleport following
these a half hour later a full division of fifty planes
including ten large bombers finally at intervals of
two hours four more divisions of fifty planes each
this would give time for lowering the planes from
the landing deck and storing them on the decks below
the landing deck was equipped with derricks for the
hoisting and lowering of planes also with catapults
for starting them off most of the planes were equipped
for landing either in water or on the land but the
landing deck presented less difficulties and would be
used to full capacity on the second day it was
planned to send fifteen more divisions to the isleport
thus making up the full fighting force of a thousand
planes a naval squadron was also timed to arrive on
the second day and would include a number of air-
craft motherships which would aid in operations at
the front and provide storage for a number of planes
as well as means for the repair of minor injuries

  bob holden had no certain knowledge of the stu-
pendous scale of operations planned by the european
alliance but none were more familiar than he with
the aircraft resources of europe and he had calculated
with remarkable precision the details of the attack
thus he reasoned that the squadron of scout planes
would be followed shortly by a larger division and that
the work was only begun when the first squadron was
destroyed in the interval following the annihilation
of the scout squadron he was busy making readjust-
ments in the apparatus in order to conserve as much
power as possible as long as the wind continued at
its present rate the supply was sufficient for the re-
quirements but he did not care to be throw too
quickly upon his storage battery reserve he knew
that the larger division which would follow would re-
quire greater power as the tube would be in operation
during a longer period of time in case of necessity
he could of course let them come closer and cut down
the power by decreasing the range such a procedure
however would expose the isleport to the enemies
machine guns and must unquestionably place in
jeopardy the outcome of the war

  ten minutes sped quickly by and then to the anxious
watchers a group of small specks appeared almost
simultaneously in the eastern sky a few minutes and
the group had spread out fan like as those farther
away came into view their formation was like that
of the previous squadron except that the heavier bomb-
ing planes were concealed behind the center of the
wedge in a position where they would be protected by
the attack planes

  holden now perceived that the plan of attack which
he had followed in dealing with the scout squadron
would not be feasible in meeting the attack of this
larger division the positive ray tube was provided
a modern atlantis



with an automatic moving device which acted on the
pivot of the tube moving it through an arc from left
to right or vice versa in much the same manner as
that on an astronomical telescope which may be set
to follow a star throughout the night this mechanism
when thrown into gear moved the tube almost im-
perceptibly sweeping the ray through a segment of
space and destroying everything in the vertical plane
through which it passed for while the ray was con-
centrated along parallel lines it spread out slightly in
the vertical plane an inch of movement of the tube
on the circumference of its twelve inch disk would
sweep the ray through a six mile arc at a distance of
ten miles from the isleport and this movement would
take approximately two minutes to accomplish

holden now decided to aim the tube slightly to
the left of the outermost plane and engage the
gears of the moving device then as he pressed the
pedal down a slight motion to the side would lock it in
place until released and the ray would be in continu-
ous action during the time it was thus locked the
perpendicular spreading out of the ray would prevent
a plane from escaping it by diving or seeking higher
altitudes the division was now in full view and he
decided that it would be necessary to let the foremost
plane approach to within about eight miles before be-
ginning the attack he knew that they carried no
guns that could reach the isleport at more than five
miles even though they desired to do so they would
naturally expect that the scout division had made a
landing and stowed away their planes on the decks
below and would entertain no suspicion that the isle-
port was in the hands of an enemy but in the event
that they became warned through the destruction of
their planes and should open fire on the defenders
the automatic moving device would enable holden and
kitty cromwell to seek shelter behind the light steel
wall of the circular room

  on they came a magnificent sight thrilling with
potential power a flock of birds carrying with them
the elements of human destiny holden had a sickening
sense at thought of the destruction he was about to
accomplish but he set his teeth and hardened himself
with the counter thought of the destruction of de-
fenseless women and children which it was their mis-
sion to consummate and which he alone could frus-
trate ten miles nine eight he aimed the tube
locked in the moving device and pressed and locked
the pedal in position a flash a puff of smoke then
another and another

  they were both so intent upon their work that they
failed to notice a figure stealthily emerging from the
ramp on the landing deck some thirty yards in their
rear barely half a minute had elapsed after holden
locked in the pedal thirty seconds during which the
low hum of whirring propellors was carried faintly to
them on the wind suddenly the nearer air was broken
by a shot and bob holden dropped to the platform
kitty cromwells revolver was in her hand as she
wheeled to face ravnowickz coming over the landing
deck but quickly as she fired her shot was as the echo
to another report from the direction of the ramp

  ravnowickz revolver dropped from his relaxing
fingers and his hand clutched his breast slowly he
spun round with sagging knees lurching as he did
so nearer and nearer to the edge of the landing deck
then with a final plunge he hung for half a second
over the edge and as his muscles stiffened the body
balanced over and was carried down into the ocean far
below

chapter xi

scott renews a friendship

on the morning of the first days battle scott and
ravnowickz were each in the lower part of the
structure while the defeat of the scout squadron
was being silently accomplished by holden in the cir-
cular room on his way down to the hotel kitchen
where he breakfasted scott had left the hotel and
slipped silently around the outer door of holdens
apartment to search for any visible signs of the
austrians midnight escapade he found a few drops
of blood on the door sill but reasoned that inasmuch
as ravnowickz had run away he was not seriously
disabled the spy had undoubtedly received a warning
that would keep him in hiding until the time for the
attack following out his plan of keeping watch over
the spy immediately after his breakfast jerry scott
secreted himself in one of the sand traps on the golf
course where he could keep watch of the ramp leading
to the upper decks here he stretched himself on one
of the banks peering over the edge through a cluster
of branches that fringed the upper surface

  the warm sunshine was slanting in at the sides of
the structure drying up the moisture left by the
storm of the preceding day suddenly as he lay there
he became chilled to the marrow and at the same time
there came to him the odor of ozone that is character-
istic of violent electric discharges as he pondered
over whether to leave his hiding place in search of
warmer clothing there came a coating of frost that
covered the grass and all parts of the structure mar-
veling at this sudden glacial temperature his first
thought was that an iceberg was approaching this
idea was promptly dismissed however as it was not
the season for bergs and in any case the isleport was
protected against them at all seasons by the warm
waters of the gulf stream to the north of it the
cold passed as quickly as it had come and the frost
disappeared almost instantaneously astounded by this
vagary in the program of nature scott again crouched
in his covert in vain he strove to account for it it
could hardly be a work of nature it must be in some
way connected with bob holden he knew the im-
measurable resources of the man knew that he was
preparing to unsheath some prodigious weapon of
science against the powers of europe knew also that
whatever be the nature of his cowp it would be an un-
heralded use of forces as yet unknown to science
holden had probably been giving his apparatus a final
test and this subversion of elemental forces was a
product or a by-product of the forces he had har-
nessed from the ether of space

  he lay there for fully twenty minutes after the frost
had melted thinking over these matters and watching
at the same time the ascent from the lower deck he
was aroused from his thoughts by a tautening of the
muscles for he had experienced that indefinable sensa-
tion not to be ascribed definitely to the action of any
particular sense a feeling as of footsteps coming
stealthily up the ramp his alert senses were quickly
justified for as he looked there appeared first the
head then the shoulders then the full form of the aus-
trian as he reached the deck he turned and walked
straight toward where scott lay concealed until he
reached the bottom of the ascent to the third deck
turning he ascended the ramp on tip-toe to the deck
above scott noted that his left hand was bound up
in a handkerchief the right hand he carried in the
pocket of his coat no sooner had he passed from
sight on the deck above than scott followed in his
hand he carried the lugger pistol ready for instant ac-
tion following his quarry scott shortened the dia-

tance between them as they approached the landing
deck for a second time during the last twenty-four
hours he was strongly tempted to shoot but could not
bring himself to the point of shooting even this enemy
in the back except as a last resort he felt more-
over that he had the situation well in hand as he was
in a position to thwart any attempt of the spy directed
against his friend but scott did not know of the real
situation on the landing deck of the defeated squadron
or the oncoming division of airplanes nor was he
aware of the exposed position of bob holden on the
operating platform inasmuch as he had never seen the
dome opened or known of anything connected with the
inner arrangement of the circular room

  as the head and shoulders of the spy rose above
the level of the landing deck scott who was stealing
up the ramp behind him saw him crouch low and at
the same moment there came to his ears the unmis-
takable hum of distant airplanes the destruction
which ravnowickz saw already in progress as he
readied the landing deck was responsible for his
abrupt action from his position now half way up
the ramp scott saw his quarry suddenly rise upright
and simultaneously with the movement his hand shot
forward from his pocket and jerry sensed that the
hand contained a weapon the bark of the spys auto-
matic was echoed by that of jerry scotts and his in
turn was re-echoed from the opposite side as he ran
with long strides up the ramp he saw ravnowickz take
his headlong plunge over the edge another moment
and he was standing at the edge of the circular room

  dazed at the rapidity of the events of the last few
moments his mind swamped by the avalanche of
sensory impressions each separate phase of the scene
left a concrete and indelible picture upon his mind
he saw the tube with its violet tinted ray reaching
out into the offing far in the distance airplanes were
being dissolved one by one into the void a flash and
a little white cloud then nothingness this repeated
over and over again with the rapidity of machine gun
fire down in the well a woman sustained the head of
bob holden on her lap as she sobbed out his name and
covered his forehead and lips with kisses as he
leaped to the platform beside them she turned her face
upward toward him and only the railing saved him
from falling as he staggered backward

  my god-kathleen riley-how-where did you
come from she looked at him for a moment then
brushed her hand across her eyes as if to wipe away
an illusion of the senses then she said you-
jerry

  holdens eyes opened and stared questioningly at
jerry scott then rousing himself as if by a supreme
effort he said the airplanes they looked and the
ky was clear all had vanished with clearing con-
sciousness holden spoke again the pedal-quick-
dont waste power

  kitty cromwell grasped his meaning not clear to
scott and disengaged the pedal and moving device
she then proceeded to examine holdens wound the
bullet had entered high up behind the left shoulder-
blade passing through the shoulder and out of the left
breast the shock of the bullet had made him un-
conscious holden refused to be taken to his room
so they propped up his head on some blankets and went
to the laboratory from which they brought a couch and
first aid case in the laboratory she laid a hand upon
his arm and said jerry i have taken my mothers
maiden name of kitty cromwell and that is the one
by which bob knows me he nodded in assent they
had no time for further talk at present

returning to the circular room jerry picked up
his friend from where he lay on the platform and
tenderly carried him down the steps where he laid him
on the couch here they cut away the clothing from
the wound and kitty cromwell dressed and bandaged
it as well as the conditions would permit holden was
still suffering severely from the shock of the bullet
so she administered a hypodermic of glycerine sub-
nitrate to stimulate his heart action then propped
up on pillows and wrapped in blankets holden gave
directions for their preparations to meet the attack of
the next division they would still have in all prob-
ability an hour or more in which to make ready
meantime he would have an explanation for the sud-
den appearance of his friend

  jerry explained briefly how he had followed rav-
nowickz from budapest to the isleport and how on
various occasions he had been deterred from making
his presence known to them he went into but few de-
tails however and was careful to conceal any account
of his suspicions of kitty cromwell he told of the
experiences of that morning leading up to the death
of the spy then turning to her he said every time

i	shoot an austrian i meet you this is the second
time and it happaned to be the same austrian

  but how she queried you do not mean that this
ravnowickz was-

  yes the old scar i gave him the first time was
hidden by the beard i recognized him when i saw
him in budapest and later looked up his record in
paris he was first known to you by the name of
von polits his name was ravnowickz von polits
his father was austrian and his mother hungarian
he took an important part in the red revolution of
bela kun under his mothers name and afterwards
escaped into austria in later years however he had
been mostly in hungary he had been mixed in every
political upheaval of both countries for many years
either as a bolshevist or a revolutionary

i was sure i had seen him before she replied
seen him before i dont understand said holden
who had just begun to think clearly over the perplex-
ing problems that had been so suddenly thrust upon
his mind and you knew jerry before

  yes jerry and i are old friends but you must
not excite yourself now the story can wait besides
we cannot delay any longer our preparations for the
next division kitty cromwell then went over the
apparatus with scott showing him its essential work-
ing features then holden discussed with him some
of the more intricate points showing him which meters
and gauges were to be watched and how the currents
through the rheostats were synchronized while not
technically versed in mechanical and electrical theory
jerry scott soon mastered the essential working de-
tails at times as holden lay on the couch giving
directions he would close his eyes and bite his lips
as the twinges of pain shot through him kitty crom-
well was most anxious concerning the result of the
shock on his heart and was constant in her atten-
tions and watchfulness over him

  before their preparations were fairly concluded
holden whose couch was placed close to the table
which held the microphone detector announced the
approach of the second division of airplanes scott
mounted the pedestal and in an instant kitty crom-
well was beside him they had not long to wait on
came the approaching division in their wedge shaped
formation as she had already witnessed the destruc-
tion of two squadrons scott now depended on her
judgment as to the distance at which they were to
begin their work of destruction on they came now
ten then eight miles away she gave him the signal

it was not tho roll o explosions nor yet the crashing of falling debrisit was more like the roar of a series of conflagrations the grushin
of infinite matter to fill the void where matter had beon dissolved thero was a hissing of the waters with clouds upon clouds of steam
where a moment before had been ten miles of ships the pride of europes mighty navies only the troubled waters now marked the place

where they had so proudly floated

and he sighted the tube then threw in the gears of
the moving device and pressed and locked down the
pedal

  jerry scott marvelled at the silent destruction that
followed a rapid succession of flashes-a few wisps
of smoke floating away on the breeze-just an in-
stant of time then nothingness some of the planes
seeing their comrades being annihilated tried to dive
and cross below the others but they only dove into
the silent death it was inescapable and there was
no time to send out a message of what was happen-
ing just a change of state of matter from solid to
gaseous form a sudden release of energies pent up
in the atom since the beginning of time a flash as
some of the atoms reunited with the oxygen in the
air death to those who guided the planes was pain-
less simply an instantaneous physical dissolution one
moment they were the next they were not there
was no struggling no wracking of the body with pain
no clogging at the throat as with poisonous gases no
aftermath of maimed bodies and sightless eyes or
years of hopeless suffering just the final ultimate
moment of time moved up to the present it was war
but war stripped of its terrors and best of all it
was war that would make war henceforth forever
impossible

  the annihilations of the third fourth and fifth divi-
ions that afternoon was as complete as had been
those of the morning following the fifth division
came a long period of waiting they had timed the
appearances of the other divisions and found a two-
hour interval between them so after two and a half
hours had passed with no indication of approaching
planes on the microphone it was decided that there
was no longer any reason for remaining at their
station the allies would time their flight so as
to arrive at the isleport during the daylight hours in
order to avoid confusion and accidents the sun was
now not over an hour above the western horizon so
at holdens direction jerry scott opened the power
switches and closed the leaves of the dome in order
to protect the apparatus from the corrosive effects
of the salt air

during the latter hours of the day holdens
wound had been giving him more trouble and
kitty cromwell wished to give it a more thorough
examination and treatment than had been possible when
she had first dressed it the hotel was equipped like
an ocean liner with an operating room which for-
tunately was located on the upper floor this being
on the same level as that of the apartment and
laboratories from this room scott procured an oper-
ating table to which they transferred the wounded
man and wheeled him into the operating room holden
objected at first to being treated as a casualty main-
taining that his wound was merely a flesh wound
and that he was perfectly able to walk but his nurse
demanded implicit obedience in which demand she
was ably seconded by jerry scott in the well-
lighted operating room kitty cromwell went about
her work with that quiet efficiency and assurance that
had been acquired on the fighting front when doctors
were scarce she found an able assistant in jerry
who had likewise had a valuable training in the care
of the wounded both during wartime and in the
jungle the operating room was equipped with an
x-ray tube with the use of which she had a reason-
able degree of familiarity holden directed them in
the matter of the current controls in order to obtain
the right quality of light for a fluoroscopic examina-
tion for neither felt competent for the more technical
process of taking a photograph nor did the time per-

mit they were principally concerned with the detec-
tion of any splinters of bone from the shoulder-blade
and the examination revealed two such slivers which
had been partly torn off by the bullet these
were removed after administering a local anaesthetic
inasmuch as they considered that holdens heart might
be affected by complete anaesthesia cauteries were
then prepared and inserted into the wound both from
the back and from the chest these would be left in
for a day or so to insure thorough disinfection of the
wound it was not necessarily a dangerous wound
except as any wound may be dangerous holdens
previous condition must be taken into account and
the day had been an arduous one they bandaged the
wound with antiseptic dressings and bound the arm
in a fixed position in order to prevent irritation
through movement holden was then placed in a re-
clining wheel chair and conveyed to his apartment

  bob holden was overjoyed at the timely appearance
of his friend there was much to talk over but scott
realized the necessity for keeping his friend from too
great excitement and therefore did most of the talk-
ing himself he led them through-ais travels and ad-
ventures in remote parts of the world but he did
not once allude to his former acquaintance with kitty
cromwell he told them more in detail of his chance
meeting with ravnowickz in budapest and of the con-
versation he had overheard which led to his following
the spy but he did not mention again his recognition
of the austrian nor any of the circumstances of their
former meeting during the world war this would
have involved the story of kitty cromwell and it was
hers to tell whenever she should wish to do so his
story of his combat with the spy on the golf course
and of the subsequent escape of the latter from the
room where he had been left bound was received
with enthusiasm

  and all that responded kitty cromwell was
taking place while we sat here knowing nothing of
it not even of your presence on the isleport

  even ravnowickz he replied did not know of my
presence here

  how do you mean he did not know of it

  he thought he was fighting bob and could not
understand how such a great student should also be
able to conquer him in personal combat but there is
something for you to explain kitty cromwell how
about that shot you fired last night

  so you knew of that also has anything transpired
here that you did not know about perhaps you also
know about the code message he sent

  scott repeated it almost verbatim to their utter
amazement he then told them how he had ob-
tained the message and also of his midnight vigil on
the previous night

  i see she said that there is no use trying to
hide anything from you so i will lay bare my vil-
lainous alliance and cast myself upon your mercy
then she told of dr von sturm of her interview with
the spy and his demand for the wax impression of the
key to holdens laboratory but when jerry produced
the block of wood containing the impression from the
pocket where he had deposited it on the day before the
room echoed and re-echoed with their laughter when
the merriment had subsided she suddenly turned upon
her would-be tormentor with now jerry honor
bright you thought bob had a spy in his own camp
didnt you that is why you were watching last
night you thought that ravnowickz and myself would
be holding midnight parley on how best to murder your
friend and turn the isleport over to our european
allies

  it was jerrys turn now to show signs of discomfort
a modern atlantis



and embarrassment but he rightly divined that silence
was better than any answer he could make to one
who had so keenly analyzed his thoughts he now
wished to be alone for a time to think over the events
of the day so he excused himself on the plea that he
would keep watch for a time in case the fleet should
put in an appearance holden assured him that a
duplicate microphone buzzer was connected in his
room and would give them due warning of such an
event but jerry insisted that now the war was on
in earnest they could rot exercise too great caution
moreover holden was much worn by the exciting events
of the day and needed rest

  in the palm garden jerry selected a spot with an
unobstructed view toward the east and made himself
comfortable in a steamer chair the night was clear
and bracing but not cold the next day would un-
doubtedly witness operations on a larger scale and
it seemed that if the allies should make a combined air
and naval attack nothing short of a miracle could
save them but he had that day witnessed a miracle
in the destroying effect of the positive ray and he
knew that he had yet to fathom the resources of the
brilliant scientific mind of bob holden their safety
lay in a great measure in the fact that the destruc-
tion wrought that day was unknown to the european
alliance would they expect some message from their
forces on the isleport that night they undoubtedly
would he thought of wheeling holden out to the wire-
less room then he considered that he would not know
what station signal to call moreover there would be
great risk of the allies detecting the ruse inasmuch as
the operator at the other end would undoubtedly recog-
nize that holdens sending was not that of ravno-
wickz or of any other operator that would be delegated
to the work on the whole it were better to let them
suppose that there was a mishap to the wireless send-
ing equipment let them suppose anything they wished
their imagination could hardly at the utmost visualize
the completeness of their disaster especially after the
message the spy had sent

  finally his thoughts wandered out over the varied
experiences of his wandering life it had all been a
glorious adventure captivating to one of his tempera-
ment there had been enough of the valleys to enhance
the beauty of the sun-kissed peaks he had peered into
all sorts of environs and lived under all sorts of con-
ditions but he had lived for the sheer joy of living
his paths had crossed and recrossed with those of
others notably with those of bob holden and kitty
cromwell now to converge again upon this fabled
atlantis the masterpiece of holdens master mind
he had carried through the years the memories of
this adorable irish lass and now had found her again
after years of seeking but he saw only too clearly
how matters stood betwen her and his friend he
would not intrude his own feelings to leave any pangs
of regret they should never know how he felt toward
her deep within himself he felt the fitness of these
two for each other and he held some modest doubts
of his own ability to bring to her happiness in such
measure as he knew he would receive it he was after
all only a vagabond he had never concentrated on any
work such as bob holden had done his art was his
greatest achievement and in that he felt that he
could have risen to far greater heights had he been
a more earnest and consistent worker he would see
this thing through and if they came out of it un-
scathed would take up his pack again and carry on
this settled he wrapped his blanket about him and fell
lightly to sleep the sleep of his jungle days when
men and beasts threatened from every quarter sleep
that left the ears attuned to the sounds of the night

yet he had learned thus how to get the necessary rest
and refreshment he awoke with the first graying
in the eastern sky harbinger of the day of destiny
about to dawn

chapter xii

the battle of atlantis

morning dawned on the second day of what was
to be known in history as the battle of at-
lantis holden although suffering intensely
from his wound insisted on accompanying his two
friends to the circular room while they were filled
with anxiety for his welfare there seemed to be no
alternative the failure of any part of the compli-
cated apparatus to function properly would undoubt-
edly cost them their lives as well as the loss of the
cause for which they fought accordingly they ac-
ceded to his demand and wheeled-him into the ob-
servatory where he directed jerry scott in the open-
ing of the dome and the preparation of the apparatus

  the wind had veered during the night to eastward
and was now blowing almost exactly from the direc-
tion from which the attacking forces would come this
was favorable to the trio of defense as it placed the
long side of the isleport with the circular room broad-
side to the line of attack and made it less possible
for any of the enemy to get around in the rear the
isleport not having been designed with a view to its
present militant purposes had one vulnerable point
for while an air attack from any quarter could be
repelled providing the planes maintained a reasonable
altitude an attack from naval vessels from the side
of the isleport opposite to the observatory must have
proved successful to the attacking forces this was
due to the fact that the deflection of the positive ray
tube to an angle necessary to meet such an attack
would bring the opposite side of the structure itself
into the path of the positive ray moreover had the
wind been from a westerly direction such a condition
would have undoubtedly proved disastrous inasmuch
as the structure would then have intervened between
the positive ray tube and the approaching aerial
armada holden had considered such a possibility and
had the contingency arisen he had decided to lower
the rear side of the isleport by letting air out of
the bottles on that side until the decks slanted down-
ward away from the circular room if this provision
did not sufficiently remove the landing deck from the
path of the ray this deck together with the upper
stories of the hotel would be cut in twain in any
case he must take the hazard if the winds did not
favor he was relieved therefore to find that nature
had contributed to the success of the cause he spon-
sored in the matter of an attack from the rear
he depended upon the enemys ignorance of the con-
ditions the complete annihilation of their air fleets
on the previous day would prevent them from acquir-
ing any knowledge of the means of destruction em-
ployed against them and in order to keep them in
ignorance of this weakness he would engage the at-
tacking forces while they were yet at sufficient dis-
tance to prevent its discovery the absence of any
radio message from their compatriots supposed now
to be occupying the isleport would in all probability
cause them to exercise a greater degree of precaution
in their approach on this the second day of their
mobilization

  holden from his wheel chair interspersed his in-
structions to jerry scott with periods of listening at
the microphone in order to catch the first sound of
approaching planes finally there came to him the
faint sounds of distant propellors and in another

twenty minutes they caught sight of the oncoming di-
visions as they came into clearer view it became
apparent that they were coming in larger force than
on the previous day and the watchers were soon able
to distinguish the outlines of three separate divisions
through the binoculars the center division was
flanked on either side by a division flying some dis-
tance in the rear of the leading one each division
was arranged as on the previous day in wedge shaped
formation whether the absence of communications
from their comrades had led to a suspicion that called
for a concerted movement could only be conjectured
by those awaiting the attack certain it was how-
ever that this new front presented problems which
the attack of the previous day had not previsioned
scott and miss cromwell on the platform swept sea
and sky with the glasses and kept holden informed
of the tactics employed by their adversaries receiving
from him in turn directions for the conduct of the
defense

  they must not let the enemy approach close enough
to come within effective range for the use of their
machine guns yet it would be necessary to allow the
leading division to approach near enough to insure
that none of those in the rear could make their escape
as on the previous day they were flying at an alti-
tude of approximately three thousand feet when they
had reached a distance of about eight miles from the
isleport holden directed scott to aim the tube at the
rear right hand division and lock in the moving device
and pedal he must however be ready to throw it out
of gear at any moment as occasion might demand
in rapid succession there came the staccato of flash
and puff of smoke and the visual blanking of the space
where before a plane had been in a little more than
a minute the right hand division was swept away but
during the interval that this stupendous work was in
progress consternation seized the other two divisions
the one on the left right-faced hoping to elude this
mysterious power which in a moment of time had de-
stroyed a division of fifty planes but the leading
division came straight on spreading out however to
avoid if possible the destruction wrought by what
they must have supposed to be some new type of anti-
aircraft gun

  jerry scott swung the tube to head off the flight of
the left hand division then as he stepped on the pedal
he slowly moved the tube back toward the line of
planes now massed by their manuevre into what ap-
peared from the side to be a compact group as this
line of planes rushed into the path of the ray slowly
sweeping to meet them the destruction was appalling
the division was dissolved almost in an instant only
a denser cloud of smoke told where they had been
back swung the tube to the leading division now less
than five miles distant a rain of machine gun bullets
fell into the water a half mile short of the isleport
scott stopped the leader then they heard the sing
and whine of bullets through the air above them
quickly he whirled the tube from plane to plane
pressing the pedal with each movement and picking
off the foremost of the flyers as the flashes followed
each other in rapid succession confusion seized those
that were left some sought refuge in higher altitudes
while others dived low or wheeled about to flee from
the wrath of that invisible power in the confusion
that resulted all sense of order was lost it became
a race of every man from the silent death that awaited
him plane crashed into plane followed by bursts of
flame and the shooting of seething tongues of fire into
the waters beneath but scott did not pause in his
work of destruction with the precision of a pendu-
lum he swung the tube from group to group and plane

  to plane for none must escape to carry back the news

during the engagement kitty cromwell stood be-
side him and kept up a rapid fire of reports to
the impatient holden in his chair below the cold
chilled them to the marrow the frost gathered on hair
and clothing and coated the metal parts of the struc-
ture and apparatus save those parts which were
warmed by the reaction taking place in the tube
with the first whistling of the bullets scott had mo-
tioned her to go below but she did not heed him and
kept up her stream of reports to the wounded man
who could scarcely be restrained from mounting the
platform beside them

  a flash she said one gone two three five they
go so fast i cannot count them consternation has
seized them they wheel and retreat a whole division
has turned back but we are following them the
division is wiped out then as the bullets whistled
around them the leader is down two more are
gone some rise others dive two crash and fall
in flames now two more they criss-cross some
wheel to go back then flash flash flash little puffs
of smoke are all that remain of them now only a
few scattered planes flying back a flash a puff
then another and another all is over three di-
visions are wiped out then turning to jerry scott
she extended her hand with bravo jerry but as
she turned something over the horizon caught her
eye and she picked up the binoculars not a sound
came from her companions as she focussed them then
she said little wisps of smoke over the horizon
drifting toward us on the wind i think it is the
battleships that are coming

  scott looked and confirmed her opinion they were
probably between twenty-five and thirty miles away
tell me bob said jerry what will be the effect of
this ray on a battleship

  one can never tell said holden until a thing is
tested and naturally i have never made such a test

i	have turned steel wood coal even a diamond into
gas instantaneously but that was at a short distance
probably at a distance say of a hundred yards the
ray would cut a ship in twain but at a distance of
a few miles it should disintegrate the structure of a
battleship as readily as that of an airplane how-
ever we shall soon see

  the band of smoke drifting across the horizon had
broadened out now and seemed to be coming from
three separate lines of ships in half an hour their
masts and stacks could be plainly seen through the
binoculars there was apparently a central line of
battleships flanked on either side by a line of de-
stroyers and light cruisers suddenly the entire fleet
began to belch forth black smoke from their stacks
which drifting down the wind in front of them
quickly blotted them from view

  do you think they could have seen the destruction
of the air fleets queried scott or could one of the
planes have sent a message

  there was hardly time to send any message re-
plied holden but they may have seen some of the
flashes in the air and are scenting danger however
they will not know whether some of their planes have
made a landing or not they could easily reach us
now with their long range guns but not knowing the
fate of their aircraft they will hardly risk firing until
a closer view discloses the real situation the posses-
sion of this isleport as a base is absolutely necessary
to the carrying out of their plans and they will not
willingly take any steps that would result in its de-
struction it will moreover undoubtedly seem incred-
ible to them that all their planes have been destroyed
a modern atlantis



as the ray tunneled its way to the hull of the submarine a mountain of water and steam rose high into tho sky resembling as it rose the
rrithing twisting body of a waterspout    down where the waters bad been voided when the ray tore its gulf in the side of neptune the
oa rushed back with the force of a tidal wave that shook the isleport then came the downpour like a cloudburst

and the fact that none have returned will be taken
as a clear indication that the isleport is in their
possession the smoke screen will work to our ad-
vantage as well as theirs for it will soon shut the
islepoijt out from their view

  but when they shut off the screen scott replied
they will have the advantage as they can fire on us
as soon as it clears enough to show them our position
we will not wait for that the positive ray will
dissolve the screen just as readily as it docs any other
form of matter let them come on for half an hour
that should bring them within eight miles of us at
most then dissolve the screen by a light pressure on
the pedal it will require but very little power as
soon as you see a ship sight the tube and give them
the full power pick the middle line of battleships
first if you can see them then the two lines of de-
stroyers to right and left they will be sailing in
straight lines one ship following another as they
will have fixed our position before laying down the
screen that would be their safest plan if we were
simply using some new high powered explosive if
they were aware of the means of destruction in our
power they would spread out in a long line to en-
circle us in such a position it would be easy for
them to destroy us before we could get any large
number of their ships their present tactics are such
as to give us the advantage with the positive ray

  on and  floated the black menacing pall of smoke
down the wind it came toward the isleport it rolled
along the tops of the waves like a stygian cloud and
hidden in its depths lay the power to destroy them
one shot from one of those great guns and all would
be over for them their safety lay in the enemys
ignorance of the true situation but the battleships
had lost their eyes in the destruction of their airships
they might lay down a barrage in hopes that some
stray shell would strike home but this they would not
do unless assured that none of their planes had made
a landing on the isleport

at the end of half an hour the smoke screen was
so dense about them that it was impossible to
see more than fifty yards away and that only during
momentary rifts in the pall scott with watch in hand
awaited the time for action on the preappointed
minute he pressed the pedal lightly and as the smoke
screen dissolved before the ray it disclosed the hull
of a battle cruiser not more than sevenmiles distant
bearing down under full head of steam straight for
the isleporf and behind it emerged into view ship
after ship in line even the light power used must
have generated intense heat in the path of the ray
and upon the ships for as the veil was torn aside a

shell screamed through the air above them and burst
in the water half a mile beyond them there was
not an instant to spare and as scott readjusted the

sighting of the tube holden who could no longer
restrain himself was on the platform beside them
throwing his full weight upon the pedal but rapid aa
had been their action the pedal had scarcely started
on its descent when another shell struck to the right
of the isleport and a little short of it but its burst-
ing was almost unnoticed for simultaneous with it
came a long drawn out roll as of the reverberations
of distant thunder it was not the roll of explosions
nor yet the crashing of falling debris but more like
the roar of a series of conflagrations the inrushing
of infinite matter to fill the void where matter had
been dissolved there was a seething and hissing of
the waters with clouds upon clouds of steam where
a moment before had been ten miles of ships the
pride of europes mighty navies only the troubled
waters now marked the place where they had so
proudly floated the exalted symbols of the power and
majesty of their nations

  another instant and the two lines of destroyers
were dissoued into space just a long flash that
receded as it sped down the line like a devouring
flame a seething of the waters and the long low
rumble as of distant thunder two or three shells had
screamed harmlessly over their heads fired by the
destroyers in the interval of time that had elapsed in
sighting the tube but there had been no time for
the gunners to find their range and the shells went
wide of their mark

  it was kitty cromwell who sighted the periscope
rising from the water less than half a mile to their
left she waited to speak no word but quickly whirled
the tube deflecting it as she did so and stepped on
the pedal neither of the trio were prepared for the
stupendous character of the results that followed a
seething cauldron of superheated steam burst with
volcanic force from the path of the ray where it met
the surface of the ocean as it tunneled its way to
the hull of the submarine a mountain of water and
steam rose high into the sky resembling as it rose
the writhing twisting body of a waterspout clouds
of steam spread out over the heavens and a wave of
scorching heat swept back upon them down where
the waters had been voided when the ray tore its gulf
in the side of neptune the sea rushed back with
the force of a tidal wave that rocked the isleport
then came the downpour like a cloudburst tons of
water poured over the decks and into the circular
room and the structure shook and trembled under
the impact then suddenly the sun burst through the
clouds of steam and mist and the isleport was enclosed
in a circle of rainbows

  they stood drenched to the skin gazing at tho
effects of the stupendous phenomenon they had wit-
nessed far in the distance a few scattered cruisers
or destroyers which had left their line when the first
line of ships were destroyed were fleeing under full
speed from the mysterious destruction

   as they turned to look at each other overawed by
the incredible cataclysm of the morning and rejoicing
in their signal victory over the god of war neither
one spoke but their hearts were filled with paeans of
thanksgiving for their safe deliverance and the de-
liverance vouchsafed to millions of others throughout
the world but as they looked into each others eyes
brimming with tears they saw holdens body relax
and sink limply to the platform jerry scott was just
in time to catch him gently he carried his pal down
the steps and placing him in the chair rolled him
back to his apartment where they placed him in his
bed exhaustion excitement the heat and the drench-
ing he had received had brought on the collapse they
had feared and fever followed quickly in its train

tidings

america heard the news of the battle through
london where it had been received from the
azores out of the great armada consisting of
fourteen battle cruisers twenty-six battleships fifteen
airplane mother ships thirty-seven cruisers and forty-
six destroyers only seven destroyers and three cruisers
had returned to fayal and more than four hundred
airplanes had been destroyed the submarines and
the remaining divisions of airplanes had been turned
back by the fleeing destroyers only one super-sub
had taken part in the attack and it was never heard
of again

  the nature of the forces which had wrought such
wholesale destruction was wrapped in mystery in-
vestigation soon revealed the fact that bob holden
had gone to isleport number two on the day preced-
ing the announcement of the purposes of the euro-
pean alliance and that he had not returned when the
isleport was evacuated holden was well known in
government circles where he was looked upon as the
outstanding scientific genius of the world the stu-
pendous results could be accredited to no other agency
and he was heralded by the press as the wizard who
had written finis to the worlds book of wars mean-
time no word had come from the isleport and doubts
were beginning to be entertained for his safety radio
calls were being sent out for the isleport at hourly
intervals but no reply had come of course it was
possible that the sending apparatus on the isleport
had been damaged during the battle but even in such
a case a man of holdens resources would undoubt-
edly find a means for repairing any damages short of
a complete wreck of the apparatus the government
of the united states which a few days before had
been making frenzied efforts to meet the impending
catastrophe now responded to the universal demand
and dispatched airplanes and a fleet of fast cruisers
to bring home the man who had rendered such signs
service to his native land

   the senate which for days had listened in its usual
 majestic state of innocuous desuetude to the caustic
 denunciations of the minority party over the failure
 of the two houses to agree upon measures for adequate
 aerial defense now gathered together its scattered wits
 and voted holden a distinguished service medal

  barricades which had been hastily erected to pro-
tect the tops of the skyscrapers in lower manhattan
were removed and the stock exchange resumed its
business this time with abnormal operations marine
stocks soared to new high points and trans-atlantic
airplane service inc notwithstanding the losses it
had sustained in the sinking of its isleports jumped
more than fifty points in a single day

  in thousands of homes throughout the land gold
star mothers and the mothers of a younger genera-
tion offered thanksgiving for the thing that had come
to pass and for him who had brought it to pass for
the press throughout the land acknowledged with one
voice that the horrors of war were over forever and
that henceforth the history of nations must be written
in terms of peace and constructive progress rather than
in those of war and destruction

  the european alliance lost no time in treating for
peace they recognized the futility of making war
against such unknown and all-powerful forces the
wildest rumors were afloat concerning the nature of the
silent death that had dissolved their mighty armada
none of the survivors had been near enough to the
front to give any adequate description of what had
happened they had witnessed their first line battle-
a modern atlantis



ehips destroyed in an instant of time leaving no
wreckage to tell the tale they had felt the scorching
heat and had turned out of their own line to get away
from the holocaust there had been no sound of shot
or shell just a series of flashes that swept down the
line of ships with the roar of a conflagration the
waters had boiled and sent out clouds of steam some
had seen a violet tinted light that played for an in-
stant along the line of ships then vanished whatever
the power might be it was invincible nothing could
withstand it the united states could operate such an
engine of destruction from every warship it was even
rumored that such preparations had been made one
thing was certain guns and explosives of all sizes and
description were forever obsolete so far as their use in
war was concerned navies could be cast into the junk-
heap and airplanes must look for their future develop-
ment to the enterprises of peaceful industries one
man armed with such a power could defy and had de-
fied the world it was an accepted conclusion that when
the conference of london should gather to arrange
the terms of peace a protocol calling for universal
disarmament would be required by the united states
as a preliminary to further overtures

  it was the third day after the battle and america
still awaited some word from atlantis airplanes had
been dispatched the night before and the press of
america waited with bated breath for the first news
from the isle of destiny the great newspaper press-rooms
of new york and the atlantic seaboard had the story
of bob holdens life all set atlantis was treated with
a wealth of detail pictures of the isleport and par-
ticularly of the mysterious circular room with its semi-
spherical dome had been obtained and used to decorate
the front pages of the extras which now awaited only
the message momentarily expected the fastest oper-
ators were ready at the linotype machines and the
editorial offices and wireless rooms waited with bated
breath for the expected call all wireless service had
been suspended and the nation held itself in the tense
silence of expectancy

  then came the call agreed upon it was world
peace the operators galvanized into action type-
writers hummed as they transcribed the dots and
dailies which came over the ether page after page
fell from the hands of the operators into the hands
of alert messengers who rushed them madly to the
linotype rooms twenty minutes from the time the
message was ended the first extras were cried by
the newsboys on the streets

  holden alive but wounded ran the head-
ing newsboys were showered with bills that demanded
no change in return for the coveted copies people
gathered in crowds on the streets and talked excitedly
to others whom they knew not social barriers and the
prestige of position were all swept aside in the common
concern for the welfare of the man who had saved
them from the horrors of war men mounted boxes
and read aloud to surrounding groups from the cov-
eted sheets which the presses could not reel off fast
enough to meet the demand here and there stood a
group with bared heads as one offered prayer else-
where tears mingled with cheers as business forgotten
the banker and the pauper wheeled into the lines of
spontaneous parades and marched up fifth avenue or
broadway from the financial district to the upper bus-
iness sections it was a nations hour of thanksgiving

  in a street in the west eighties one dr von
sturm made a hurried departure in response to a
call but he never returned to his practice secret
service agents who later sought to trace him could
find no clue to his whereabouts

  at the harvard club holdens former friends and
classmates recounted incidents in the life of their now
illustrious comrade one who had been present on
that night many years ago told the story of jerry
scott and of the toast that they drank then to the
abolition of war jerry was now with bob holden
and this was the sequel to that night a reporter was
present and the following day the story was featured
in his newspaper but no one knew of the identity of
the nurse kitty cromwell

  the nation now settled down to await the outcome
of holdens illness extravagant preparations were
made for his home-coming a force of surgeons and
nurses were sent to the isleport but the days drifted
into weeks as the forces on atlantis battled with the
fever there was a season of tumultuous rejoicing
mingled with tears and prayers of thanksgiving when
the message finally came announcing that fie crisis
had passed then the nation again waited

chapter xiv
a pledge fulfilled

atlantis was basking in the sunlight of a well
earned rest that utopian peace which cen-
turies before had inspired ancient thought with
its chimerical visions had become the harbinger of a
universal concord among nations to the trio marooned
on this modern antitype of the ancient conceit there
had come the counterpart of that which they had given
to the world they lived under the shadow of holdens
illness but the shadow could not dim the halo of
service for one who had given so much to them and
to the world kitty cromwell was incessant in her at-
tentions by day and jerry scott spent the night hours
beside the bed of his friend but she was never far
away and ever appeared at the slightest sound to
soothe him back to untroubled sleep her power in
quieting him did not pass unnoticed by scott once
from the background of the library he noted the color
that suffused her cheeks when holden mumbled in-
coherent words from which he only caught distinctly
her first name

  for days holden wandered in delirium roaming
mostly through the pleasant paths of the palm garden
he loved anon he talked of his boyhood days on the
new england farm of its orchard and flowers and of
his mother whose sainted image had left an undying
impress upon his youthful mind for to one who
throughout the normal walks of life attunes his spirit
to the natural and the beautiful even the fancies of a
delirious brain will seldom depart therefrom there
were times when his mind slipping into the more re-
cent pathways drifted over troubled seas at such
moments there arose visions of war and the ogre of a
black-bearded stranger rose as a menace before him
but even in such moments there was the struggle to
protect some one from harm some one he loved then
as the vision of the struggle merged into that of the
greater conflict he would say beneath his breath god
help the poor devils but it is war i cannot do other-
wise

  shortly after breakfast on the third day after the
battle jerry scott was aroused from a reverie in the
quiet of the palm garden by the sound of approaching
planes he ascended to the landing deck to see five of
these great birds approaching the isleport then one
after another with graceful swoop skimmed over the
deck coming to a full stop near the far end walking
toward them he was soon surrounded by a group of
airmen it required some minutes for him to convince
them that he was not holden and that the man they
sought lay wounded in his room below and could not

out of the jaws of death

eyond a doubt a child in a bathing suit
appeals to the whole world there is some-
thing universally enjoyable in the frisking
white legs the dancing eyes and wild
laughter the surf loses its ominousness
in the presence of such

  florence neil aged nine playing on the beach at
santa cruz that summers morning offered convincing
proof of the truth just stated the child held the at-
tention of everyone successfully competing with the
charms of certain older members of her own sex whose
bathing suits had been calculated to monopolize all sight-
seeing even the most sophisticated of the beach-lizards
found greater enjoyment in the childs innocent abandon

  already florence gave promise of unusual beauty
she was a fairy-like creature slender small-jointed and
frail when in repose although wonderfully animated in
action the tight one-piece suit revealed the grace and
freedom of every motion four years later she was due
to become stiff angular and awkward agonizingly self-
conscious  now she was utterly unaware that she offered
a rare picture a picture of radiant childhood perfect
spirited and unspoiled

  cavorting there on the
sand her voice shrilling
gleefully as she imagined
herself being chased by
the long snaky bit of sea-
weed which she was trail-
ing she felt no inkling of
what was passing through
the minds of her behold-
ers the proud watchful
eye of her mother seated
under a wide umbrella a
few yards away made no
impression upon the care-
free mind of the child

none of the admiring
glances from beach board-
walk or pier made her
forget the supreme satis-
faction she was getting
from her lark in short
for the time being she
was merely the uncon-
scious medium of expres-
sion for a bundle of ani-
mal spirits

  noon approached and
the beach began to fill

presently among the new
arrivals four attracted

f

doesnt hire a couple of cops to watch the maids
florence neils mother dropped her sewing to get
a good view of the quartette the three young women
handled the boy as though in accordance with some pre-
arranged drill one removed his bath-robe another
adjusted his rubber cap and sandals while the third
presumably the maid-in-chief stood ready to lead him
by the hand presently the lad stood ankle deep in
the surf

  hes eight or nine now isnt he florences
mother heard then the reply almost ten he was
born around christmas in  remember

  mrs neil remembered too when daly fosburghs
son had arrived safely in this world the event had been
made one of great rejoicing the multi-millionaire had
presented the state of california with a magnificent art
museum in honor of his only son

  for a while florence paid no attention to the new-
comer then she gave him a glance or two decided
that her highly important affair with the seaweed could
wait and stopped long enough to give the lad a single
thorough inspection

  he stood decidedly taller than she and looked pro-
portionately heavier in all respects moreover he was
larger-boned and bigger-chested furthermore he was
blond of the type which never tans but merely turns

red after exposure to the
sun florences hair eyes
and complexion were all
just a shade darker than
average

  but the chief difference
lay in the sedate unbend-
ing manner and gait of
the lad as compared with
florences liveliness he
looked as though every
impulse to spontaneous
natural action had been
stifled in him before it
arose for despite his
premature self-conscious-
ness and gravity there
lurked more than a sug-
gestion of latent fire and
force in the unusually
good muscular develop-
ment of his whole body
the boy possessed a very
fine gymnasium

  the question was did
he possess a will of his
own he clung obedient-
ly to the maids hand as
she led him first east
then west carefully along
he took care to step in the

 or sheer daring and originality it would
 be rather difficult to eclipse the present
 story

   what after all makes dwarfs and
 what giants how small can a human
 being be and how large this theme has
 been speculated on before by scientists and
 by many fiction writers but no one has
 had the courage to propose such a giant
 as the one we meet in this story and it
 is all excellent science and all not quite
 so impossible as it sounds at first every-
 thing in this world is relative there have
 been tremendously large monsters on our
 earth as is well attested by the fossils of
 ancient animals the skeletons of which
 are in our museums

   growth after all is a matter of sur-
 roundings food and gland action how
 far it may be stimulated no one knows
 at any rate the nth man makes in-
 teresting reading its one of those stories
 that come along once in a generation a
 story that will live forever

 tioned the mother of the girl overheard this

otherwise no sign he continued to walk quietly along

   then he noticed the girl she was staring straight at
him wondering instantly she quit wondering whirled
around and dashed into the surf laughing mischievously
out she splashed until the water reached her shoulders
where she turned about and laughed again this time
there was no mistaking her thoughts she put them
into words

  whats the matter fraid-cat cmon in i dare
you 

  the boy stared this was a brand new experience
at the same time he seemed to feel vaguely that he
had been dared before far far back in the history of
that part of the human race from which he had de-
scended was an ancestor who had never balked at a dare
not that any such philosophical thoughts passed through
that mind but his instinct told him that his manhood
was being questioned his character assailed somehow
he knew it

  the maids grasp tightened automatically the boy
started on the grasp loosened and at the same instant
the girls mocking laughter pealed forth again like
a flash the boy jerked his hand from the maids and
before she could make a move he had dashed into water
up to his waist

  there he stood gasping even in summer the surf is
cold before noon he was bewildered too by a stifled
scream behind him and a delighted squeal just ahead

  cmon fraid to come any further

  bertram come here this instant do you hear

   he heard but he knew enough to realize the difference
between the command of a hired care-taker and the chal-
lenge of an equal the one could be passed over the
other could not

  and thus bert fosburgh and florence neil became
acquainted the boys private plunge had made him a
good swimmer and he was accustomed to artificially
salted water for all her activity florence was barely
his equal in the game of tag which immediately started

  neither of the three maids dared venture into the
water for fear of a wetting one removed shoes and
stockings but she could not get near the frolicking pair
they simply went out into deeper water presently the
life-guards boat came near attracted by the laughter
and the maids hailed it imperiously

  make that boy get out of the water he musnt play
in there hurry

  the guards grin of enjoyment merely widened he
cn take care o hisself lady dont need t worry
about him

  but-he musnt play there i tell you he might
catch - something terrible playing with - strange
children

the guard took one look at the superbly healthy face
of the girl no danger lady ill keep an eye on em

  the three maids held a consultation immediately
one of them repaired to the bathhouse from which in
the course of time she emerged clad in a bathing suit
berts eyes clouded with the prospect of an end to his
lark

  but the truth is that his teeth were chattering so
were florences but the maid made the mistake of
going into the surf instead of simply commanding him
to come out he might have obeyed cold as he was
instead she waded in

  so it was to be a chase the boy warmed up also
florence became re-animated as she discomfitted the maid
with well-aimed spurts of water directed by sturdy
palms five ten fifteen minutes passed and the maid
was unable to get nearer than three yards of her quarry
and the truth is that of all the people on the beach
only the other two maids gave her the slightest sym-
pathy

  in the end it was sheer exhaustion that drove the
boy to the sand immediately the reaction came he was
glad enough to creep shivering into the warm folds of
his bath-robe but his spirit still glowed as it had never
glowed before

   good-bye shouted he to florence ive had a jolly
good time little girl havent you

  you bet coming down here again tomorrow

   the boy looked up into the three stem anxious faces
above him the maids would have to make a strict ac-
counting to daly fosburgh bert shook his head

  i think not and then he was whisked away to the
waiting limousine at the same time that florences
mother by a crafty bit of maneuvering captured and
enrobed her daughter

that was in the morning neither child had any
expectation of ever seeing the other again and
yet in the most natural manner in the world florences
mother and the three maids chose the same locality for
spending the afternoon there was nothing remarkable
in the coincidence half the visitors at santa cruz
follow the same procedure putting in part of the day at
the beach and part at veau de leau

   this place is a portion of a famous cliff drive where
the sea has carved the cliffs into fantastic shapes and
designs where a small marine museum had been erected
and where lovers of the ocean invariably repair when at
santa cruz there is no beach only the steady pound-
ing of the sculpturing waters and the wind

   the limousine arrived first keeping a firm grasp on
the boy the nurse-maids visited all the usual points of
interest carefully guarding against any sudden motion
on the boys part in fact one maid kept constantly
between him and the cliff she had not yet recovered from
hie shock of his unprecedented actions in the forenoon
the lad without showing any signs of the spirit that
still burned within him enjoyed the scenery as much as
might be expected under the circumstances

   presently the streetcar arrived and florence and her
mother got off they wandered along the cliff following
the path that everybody treads at veau de leau it
was inevitable that when it was time for the boy to
return he must encounter the girl and her mother

   this happened about five in the afternoon an import-
ant detail for it marked the moment of low tide the
water lay about thirty feet below the top of the cliff
in the light of what happened this cannot be too
strongly emphasized the distance from water to land
was five times the height of a tall man

  being late in the day there were few sight-seers
about buch visitors as were on hand were scattered
up and down the cliff paying scant attention to each
other from time to time each gazed out over the ocean
without seeing any other craft than a distant coasting
steamer earlier in the day fishing boats would have
been numerous now scarcely unruffled by the breeze
the water was tenanted only by seaweed and the natural
denizens of the deep

   im tired announced bert about five oclock lets
go back

  his word in such matters was law back the four
proceeded and in less than a minute encountered flor-
ence

   hello she shrilled delighted

   how do you do he inquired sedately but the light
began to flash in his eyes again one of the maids saw
and took hold of his other hand he was a prisoner

   what makes them so careful of you the girl wanted
to know her mother on seeing bert had deliberately
turned her back and walked away her brow clouded
and florence went on relentlessly are vou an in-
va-lid 
the nth man



  the boy shook his head mutely the maid-in-chief
answered for him and as she spoke she took in every
detail of the girls simple inexpensive gown the unpre-
tentious hat and sturdy shoes the very evident lack of
means in her whole appearance

  he is no invalid little girl but his health must be
very carefully guarded especially with great em-
phasis he must not associate with children below his
station in life

  this was over florences head her only idea of a sta-
tion was a railroad depot she replied

  mamma says i musnt play with every old tom dick
and harry whatever that means but i dont see any-
thing wrong in playing with this boy

  dont you there is no snobbery like that of the
snobbish maid to snobbish people well i think dif-
ferently keep away from him please do not come
near

  the girl stood back astounded hurt mystified she
turned an incredulous gaze into the boys troubled eyes
dont you like me in an injured tone

  oh but i do he flashed back warmly im not
angry with you little girl im just-

  the- rest of his words were blown away by the wind
a wind created by the peremptory jerking of his two cap-
tors no one seemed to notice mrs neil striding along
ahead of them her head down and her cheeks streaked
with tears her little girl was the child like herself al-
ways to face unhappiness because of the lack-of money
or-what amounted to the same thing-was florence to
suffer like that at the hands of those who had money
it was not right

  and thus it happened that the girl was left alone for
a minute or two she knew enough to keep away from
the extreme edge of the cliff she ventured to within
what seemed a safe distance and stared still much hurt
by what had happened down into the idly moving waters

  presently the boy looked back next instant he all
but jerked loose from his captors and he uttered a
shrill scream

  the cliff was crumbling beneath the girl as bert
screamed florence leaped to one side but she landed
on another crumbling portion and before the eyes of
those who were watching the earth gave way and slid
with a rumble into the sea the girl vanished from
sight

  next moment the two women who were holding the
boy found that they had their hands full he screamed
and struggled so that the third maid had to help to
hold him it was florences mother who hearing the
scream ran up and peered ove the edge

  florence was on the surface sputtering dazedly but
paddling much less franticallly than one would suppose
mrs neil shouted trying hard to keep her voice brave
cant you  t out

  florence heard she shook her head and pointed
mutely to the base of the cliff it was far too precipitous
to afford a hand-grasp much less a foot-hold

  the mother threw a swift glance around there was
no boat nearer than miles she had a fleeting fancy
about airplanes and submarines but there was no peri-
scope in sight and nothiig but seagulls in the air she
shouted again

  keep away from the rocks hold your head up and
keep your hands and feet going ill get help

  florence understood she nodded coolly and pro-
ceeded to save her strength as far as possible by putting
forth only enough exertion to keep afloat her nerve
was unshaken

  mrs neil ran as fast as her skirts would let her
past the boy and his maids and towards the buildings
no outsiders seemed to have seen the disaster and

even while clinging to the wildly thrashing boy the
three maids could see that the case was hopeless

  the child could not possibly live in that sea until her
mother brought help even though she escaped being
dashed against the rocks she must surely become ex-
hausted and give up long before she could be rescued
the buildings were too far away even the boy seemed
to realize it for all of a sudden he stopped his strug-
gling and collapsed in a heap at the same time bursting
into a fit of uncontrollable weeping the women bent
over him

  when they looked up for a moment neither could
believe her eyes each looked at the other stupidly
then gazed down at the boy as though to learn whether
he too could see what they were seeing

  then they turned their eyes towards the edge of the
cliff again at the same instant the boy also looked
up it was he who first found tongue

  why-why-where did- why what does it mean i

  and then all four fell silent there on the edge of
the cliff exhausted dripping without the remotest idea
of how she got there thirty feet above the water where
she had been drowning only a moment before above the
highest point that any wave had ever been known to
reach lay florence neil safe and sound

chapter ii
a chain of wonders

the miraculous rescue of florence neil took place
in july  and since then the world has been
treated to a series of phenomena each just as baff-
ling just as inexplicable moreover as they are ex-
amined in their chronological order these events are
found to be progressively more bewildering progressively
more vast until the final mystery leaves the mind fairly
stunned with the terrific marvel of it all

  taken one by one these miracles offer no solution that
is acceptable to the human intellect it is only when
they are grouped together as the writer is now grouping
them that they become understandable only by scour-
ing the globe to get the facts-for these mysteries were
world-wide in their distribution-and by examining cer-
tain occurrences of the past thirteen years can the mind
appreciate the stupendous thing that rescued florence
neil and that performed the other wonders about to be
related

  yet once the list is read and all the facts in each case
become known the explanation becomes almost ludi-
crously simple what had seemed miraculous becomes
natural ordinary understandable one is no longer
dubious as to whether the nth man was a creature or
a thing

  the mind comes to see after finishing the investiga-
tion that humans readily become accustomed to that
which is really astounding the familiar example of the
telephone will serve today we accept the wireless as
commonplace we forget that it was once considered
impossible

  just so do we now accept the nth man we take
him as a matter of course

	 

the captain of the cristobel raised himself shakily
to his elbow his voice quavered pitifully in his
eagerness

  well quick man-did you find it

  the mate shook his head brought up nothing but
shells with a gruffness which he probably assumed in
order to conceal any pity for the sick man shall i
try again

  no captain butler dropped back among his pil-
lows not tonight his voice was infinitely weary

  the mate lingered theres something else sir


amazing stories quarterly

when the boys saw that the drag was a failure they-
well sir i only hope it doesnt mean mutiny

   mutiny the word did not seem to surprise the cap-
 tain of the little sloop cant say-that i blame them
 he thought deeply for a moment or so then asked for
 a finger of rye he drank it and in a minute felt strong
 enough to talk he knew that the liquor would cost him
 dear a little later but he could only hope that the invest-
 ment would pay

   payson-you understand what this expedition means
dont you think-earnestly-that you could make the
boys comprehend i hate to let this thing go on rank-
ling in their minds until they are driven to extreme
measures -can stand it to wait but they cant
how about it couldnt you make them see it the way
you do

   again the mate shook his head ive done too much
talking already sir theve got so they wont pay any
attention to me unless i threaten punishment they-
ive spoiled them sir by arguing with them

   no you havent anyone could see that these two
were not born-and-bred sea-faring men but gentlemen
forced out of milder walks of life into one for which they
were never intended no payson i wouldnt have it
any different

   he took a second drink of the liquor help me into
my chair he requested rather than ordered im
going to take a chance with them

   the mate complied in silence within a minute the sick
 man was facing his crew a motley dozen picked up at
 colon two months previous the mate had rounded up
 everybody including the cook

   men began the captain without delay you can
guess why ive come out here im taking a big chance
with my hip in such bad shape but ive tried to put
myself in your place and i know that id want the facts
straight from the boss

   this treasure that were after-its just as the mate
 has told you it was lost about three centuries ago from
 a spanish pirate the cristobel this sloop was named
 after her

   but our work is not at all piratical we are here to
 recover that treasure which is in the shape of a single
 immense nugget-or rather a chunk of quartz shot
 through and through with virgin gold its history is
 uncertain but it probably originated in australia as
 for the wreck the data as to its location was handed
 down from generation to generation until finally it
 came into the possession of a man with money enough
 to get results

  that man is-myself as for this sloop and its
equipment it represents all that i have in the world
if this expedition fails i am a ruined man and must
go back to my wife and children to start life all over
again

   but if success comes i and you just as truly will
 be more or less wealthy i dont know exactly how much
 the treasure amounts to but the account indicates that
 the gold will yield over a hundred thousand at least

   it lies here exactly where we are searching of that

i am dead sure between antofagasta and caldera on
the ten-fathom line and we have already dragged half
the distance

   just stay by me boys and youll not regret it

   the whiskey had had its effect there was a manly
ring in the sick mans voice that carried conviction to
more than half his hearers a slight murmur of approval
arose quickly checked as a wiry furtive-eyed portugese
edged forward and spoke

  we know senor capitan the mate she tell us
every day she tell that all she jus tell no find
hotting

   it was a supreme effort his vocabulary was limited

he slid back hurriedly behind his fellows as though
afraid he would be overwhelmed by the applause it did
not come

  doe anybody else think the same way manuel does

   yis a powerful irishman the only man of his race
aboard the craft strode forward he threw a scornful
glance at the group which had murmured approval of the
captain oi tink its a dom shame sor yeve kept
us here goin on two months wit no gold to show fer it
at all

    tis toime we pulled up an cleared out sor

   have you any personal reason for this opinion mike

   yis the celt was not to be daunted by the strange
words the captain had used them noospapers we got
from th dago tramp steamer said they was offerin tin
bucks a day for longshoremen at noo york thats bet-
tern we be doin here

  to this there was a rumble of agreement from the
other half of the crew and of those who had been
friendly before more than one began to look doubtful

  boys-theres more to this than you think captain
butler had made up his mind to a bold move im going
to take you into my confidence

  this money-assuming that we succeed-is going to
accomplish something more than make us rich its
going to do the world a great good and im going to
tell you right now-even payson doesnt know this-
exactly what i intend to do with the bulk of my share

   to begin with youve been calling me captain butler
that is not my real name he paused to let this take
effect i merely adopted the name because it sounded
more impressive than my real name which is jones and
because i have been all my life until a few months ago
employed as a butler in the states

  for almost twenty years i was a butler men i
worked for half a dozen of the foremost families of the
land and during that time i learned to have an im-
mense amount of sympathy for people of my own class

   i found that the average servant is to be pitied not
despised men most servants are forced by poverty to
accept such work few actually prefer to wait hand and
foot on someone else it isnt natural

  so im going to take my share and found a small
home for servants children i am planning to care for
about forty the idea is to teach the poor kids some
useful trade or other occupation so that they will not
be forced into waiting on other people

  thats what im going to do with mine boys its
a big work and something to be proud of when im an
old man

   as for what you do with yours i dont care

  thats your business but at least we understand
each other now and i think youll stick by me and
match my patience with yours how about it

  had there been any downright hard feelings among
the men or any spirit small enough to take advantage
of a man in the captains position the affair might have
turned out differently but the captain had chosen his
men in the first place with an unusual amount of shrewd
psychological guidance and he had taken first-rate care
of them he of the whole ship had been ill from grub
to phonograph they had no cause for complaint

the crisis passed another month went by with
practically no change in the situation the dragging
brought no results at all and day after day the sailors
patience slowly oozed away the captains condition
which ought to have become improved remained the same
as before a little encouragement and he would have
recovered at once disappointment kept him down

   the end came on the thirty-second day after the cap-
tains burst of confidence it came as before when the
final haul of the day had proven barren and the first
the nth man



the captain knew of it the big irishman with the entire
crew at his back was pushing his way past payson into
the cabin

  dont be scared sor exclaimed mike we mane
no harm to ye none at all sor

  weve just come to tell ye that we quit no more
tis no mutiny sor were not that kind call it a
strike we jist refuse to stay here anither day an
thots an end to it

  the captain looked steadily into their eyes these
men were as he had judged before of the right sort
he had nothing to fear from them so long as he was
reasonable and he sighed as he admitted to himself
that at least he must in justice give in

  you are right mike go-back to your quarters
we sail-when the wind comes up at midnight

  the men filed silently out they knew that their stipu-
lated thirty-a-month would be forthcoming when panama
was reached and that they could ask nothing further
payson followed them and softly closed the door no
one knew what sprang to the captains eyes the moment
he was left alone

  that final evening off the coast of chile saw the crew
in their hammocks at the usual hour five bells found
the ship perfectly quiet save for the soft lap of the
pacific against the hull the gentle slapping of lines as
the sloop swayed at anchor and the constant complaining
squeak of wood against wood except for the men on
watch all were asleep

  of those awake one was the irishman the others
name nelson is important because it typifies the kind
of a character who was the chief witness to the second
of the colossal mysteries nelson a stolid unimagin-
ative swede a total abstainer whose veracity was pro-
verbial aboard the ship stood at the wheel at the
prow stood mike

  by six bells the breeze had become nearly strong
enough to work with mike however had orders to wait
until midnight and now with a return to civilization
so near he could afford to be patient he fell to watch-
ing the sway of the vessel speculating on the angle to
which she leaned

  suddenly without any apparent cause the ship
careened far over towards the shore immediately of
course she righted herself or nearly righted herself yet
mike fancied that she remained with a decided shore-
ward list it was odd mike called in a low tone to the
swede

  did ye notice thot nels

  did ay notice watt

  th ship how she tilted jist now

  oh yah ay notice him oil right

  what dye make of it nels

  the swede as always when he did not know how to
answer made no reply at all silence once more settled
over the sloop

  now it is at this point that we have to rely largely
upon wfcat nelson told apparently mikes thoughts
and eyes were elsewhere at the moment this is queer
because he afterwards declared that he had been eyeing
the waist of the ship more or less wondering what could
have caused that cant

  but nels nelson was sure absolutely sure on this
point that within a space of one minute he gave two
glances towards the waist of the ship in the first
glance he was certain he saw nothing out the way
nothing was there save the white surfaces of the cabin
walls and roof the aft hatch and the usual parapher-
nalia in the stern on his second glance less than a
minute later he saw-it

  mike called he softly

  whot is it just as softly

  ay tank you batter wake de captain

  mike was electrified he knew the swede pretty well
nothing short of something phenomenal could have roused
nels to that extent in seven steps mike racing along
the seaward side of the deck reached the steersmans
side

  what is it swede excitedly

  nelson merely nodded in the direction of the cabin
the irishman looked and as his eyes caught sight of
what lay on the shore-ward side of the deck between the
rail and the cabin he felt his hair slowly rising beneath
his cap

  an instants hesitation and he darted below and
not one minute elapsed before both captain and mate the
former well bundled up and the latter bearing a powerful
acetylene lantern emerged on the deck

  well mike constrainedly from the captain

  the irishman silently took the lantern and turned it
upon the deck beside the cabin there stood an enor-
mous object like a huge boulder two minutes before
it had not been there

  a swift examination and the truth was known be-
neath all its coating of ocean growths was revealed the
long-lost nugget of the old cristobel it was that and
nothing less

  but how did it get there water was dripping from
the stone forming a large pool on the deck on the rail
was more water and seaweed and bits of broken shells
on the hull itself was a large wet area and more shells
as for the surrounding waves a thorough search showed
nothing

  how did the stone get there how could it possibly
have gotten there when it was weighed at panama
it tipped the scales at nearly fifteen tons

chapter iii
what happened to the sphinx

pausing only to remark that captain butler lived
to see his cherished plan succeed with hundreds of
servants children infinitely better off because of
his work the investigator of the colossal mysteries is
taken to still another part of the world and whereas
the affair off the coast of chile took place in december-
which is to say summer south of the equator-of 
this next event occurred nearly two years later the day
before thanksgiving in the northern part of africa

  the account begins with a very commonplace matter
two american tourists about five oclock in the evening
stepped into a waiting automobile in front of a hotel
in cairo one arab kneeling on the running board
accompanied them the younger american himself drove
the car

  little was said as the car passed through the magnifi-
cent avenues of the modern part of the city presently
however an older part of the capital was reached and
both visitors became interested enough in the ever-chang-
ing yet changeless hordes of unfathomable orientals
it was not until the car had crossed the nile and was
approaching the railroad at the west that the older
american spoke anything that called for a reply

  i was just thinking redpath with a sudden chuckle
that these arabs were passing wouldve been pretty
badly shocked twenty years ago to see a sight like us

  you mean our car redpath slowed the machine
and drove carefully alongside the road as they overtook
and passed a caravan of camels desert-bound i under-
stand that the first of these devil wagons was pretty
badly bunged up shaw the arabs stoned the driver

  but now theyre used to it commented shaw just
what ive always held people can get used to anything
if theyve got to

and yet theres a limit redpath seemed for all
his youthfulness-or shall we say because of it-more


amazing stories quarterly

earnest and thoughtful than his elderly acquaintance
theres some things that wont stand for change theyre
perfect theyll remain as they are for all time

  dont believe it stoutly by this time an unob-
structed view of the first pyramid was to be had every-
things got to change change is the only thing thats
permanent change

  you dont say so how about that and redpath
pointed to the great egyptian monument just ahead

  shaw waved a hand airily that a mere pimple
on the face of time another few seconds out of eter-
nity and-he puffed a cloud of smoke from his cigar-
gone like that

  redpath made no comment for a while being too much
occupied with the problem of driving he wasnt accus-
tomed to a roadway in such fearful condition in fact
the topic of change versus changelessness was not re-
vived until about three hours later when the americans
camped for the night near the two pyramids which
flanked the sphinx sat down for a final smoke following
their supper

  this arab commented redpath is a dandy hes
really managed to keep all the other grafters away you
had the right hunch shaw about paying him five in ad-
vance and holding up the other five until we get back
yes and i generally have the right hunch too young
fellow but there was nothing patronizing about
shaws manner no one would have guessed that there
was twenty years difference in their ages i was right
about getting here in the evening sos to view the monu-
ments by the morning sun youll see that im right
much better view than most tourists get

  yes but its tough about our water-supply these
bags make the water taste second-hand

   a short silence broken only by the stertorous breath-
ing of their arab who had gone to sleep his head was
carefully sheltered from the moons rays redpath had
an idea and turned the rays of their portable search-
light upon the snoring mound and waited presently
the arab turned over uneasily and without half awaken-
ing he twisted about until he got his head on the other
side of the packing-case that had sheltered him from the
moon

  see that chuckled redpath subconsciously he
believed that the moon has moved in the sky and he
is afraid to sleep with his head exposed to it a pause
of thoughtfulness then i wonder if that isnt a pretty
good argument

  what for

  in favor of changelessness this fellows subcon-
scious mind he has the same subconscious mentality
that his ancestors had thousands of years ago

  pretty fair admitted shaw pretty fair no use
talking it is

  and yet young fellow how long dyou suppose this
moon-mad notion of hisd last if something should hap-
pen to the moon suppose a comet should smash the
moon for instance wouldnt his subconscious change
but nothings going to happen to the moon red-
path looked as though slightly shocked he will be bet-
ter understood when it is said that like many other young
men of wealth in america his education while very
deep was not at all broad in short extremely conserva-
tive

   the moon is there to stay he insisted so is the
earth the stars and everything else in the universe
only the details change the big facts the big princi-
ples never change

  and redpath wisely shook his head an assured smile
playing about the corners of his mouth he was staring
at the sphinx as he added no when it comes to the
great principles of life shaw my mind is as changeless
as-that sphinx

  shaw peered through the darkness towards the great
lion-bodied head that why-shes changing all the
time redpath

the sphinx change where do you get that stuff
oh perhaps youre thinking something like this
redpath changeless as the sphinx but its bunk
young fellow bunk besides that isnt the correct
quotation

  redpath that stone is very slowly disintegrating
and the times coming when itll go back to the sands it
came from

  that sphinx deliberately aggressively will be
right where it is now until the end of time

  oh dont be so darned stubborn you know better
than that redpath why the blamed thing changes
with every sandstorm it changes with every cold snap
its changing every day every night

  pure unadulterated nonsense calmly lighting a fresh
cigar

  is that so shaw grabbed the storage battery and
handed the searchlight to the other grab this and
come on well have a look at her

  it was beginning to get a little cool and both men
welcomed the exercise a vigorous trudging through the
sand and presently the pair were standing in front of the
great rock-hewn monument of the ancient egyptian
civilization

for a while like all who look upon the enormous face
for the first time both men remained silent despite
the fact that they were americans neither made any
calculations as to the weight of the rock or the years
that must have been spent in sculpturing that tremendous
head out of the living stone each remembered having
read that it stood more than sixty feet high a close rival
in size to the head of the statue of liberty the flash-
ing rays of the searchlight somehow made the figures
seem too small truly it was a marvel that the ancients
could have achieved such a thing

  of course you observe its nose at last from shaw
or rather the place where the nose used to be gone
now for hundreds of years whatve you got to say for
changelessness now

  just as much as ever stolidly how do we know
that this thing was made with a nose perhaps it was
designed just as we see it

  without a nose shaw was staggered more with
the coolness with which the idea was stated than with
the notion itself well it aint impossible he led
the way closer better take a look at the mouth red-
path

  the light plainly revealed the effects of constant ex-
posure to the storms of the desert-storms and the many
onslaughts from arabian spears the rock was fairly
eaten away from the upper lip grinding and polishing
the face of the stone the sand had made unmistakable
inroads upon the features but redpath would not
admit it

  may have been built that way he insisted of
course it doesnt seem reasonable to suppose that it was
ill admit that

  but im dead sure you go too far shaw when you
claim that the sphinx is changing-every day i think
you said

  not a bit of it sturdily its changing right now
before your eyes fact only its too minute for us
to see

  before our eyes youve got to show me with
irritating nonchalance

shaw became more than slightly excited see here
youre too all-fired stubborn for any use you know
mighty well im right youre just holding out because-n
ill bet you anything you like interrupted the other
the nth man



aggravatingly that this sphinx does not change in the
slightest overnight ill leave it to any scientist it
doesnt change

  it does flatly and ill gamble on it with anybody
  how much insolently

 any-amount-you damned- shaw stopped in
the middle of his emphatic reply his face changed an
idea had struck him and he smiled grimly as he went on
see here young fellow i dont like to bet money on
a sure thing like this its like taking money from a
baby i know im right and youll just throw your
money away i wont bet-money

  all right with a sneer if you havent got the
courage why-

  as i say i wont bet for money there was a new
a steely look in shaws eyes now but ill put up
another kind of a wager and see if youre man enough to
take me up

  the proposition is this redpath this sphinx
changes a little bit each and every night well leave it
up to a vote of two out of three scientists hows that
all right but whats the bet

  punishment for whoever loses im so dead sure im
right im willing-if i lose-to come back here to the
sphinx and climb to the top and kiss the rock well
say im to make a pilgrimage here every ten years to
do the same thing

  fair enough what about me

  if you lose-if we learn that the old girl really does
change overnight-then since youre so infernally sure
of your stand youre to do this

  youve got to change your clothes six times a day
for the next six months

  redpath gravely considered for six months

  not a day less

  all right ill take you up on that shaw

  the two men shook hands then feeling rather
ashamed perhaps they stood for some time playing the
searchlight over the great countenance and studying the
baffling expression of its weather-beaten features

  as they returned to camp redpath switched off the
light they strode through the sand for some minutes in
silence enjoying the effects of the moonlight upon the
desert queer shadows loomed from behind sand heaps
and changed the landscape into a gray and black one
full of possibilities for those who are susceptible to
fancies redpath was practical but shaw had an imag-
ination and it was he who shortly before reaching
camp stopped suddenly and uttered an odd exclamation
redpath did you see that

  what curiously

  that pyramid i thought it-moved

  redpath laughed maliciously moved that pyra-
mid sure it didnt stand on its head shaw

  the older man had recovered from his surprise and
now looked very much abashed he took out a handker-
chief and wiped his forehead

  my eyes i guess might have been a camel moving
around behind the thing fooled me all right

  but redpath noticed that his companion cast more
than one mystified glance at the huge heap of rock be-
fore reaching the camp and the last thing before
getting under the blankets shaw raised his head and
looked long and earnestly at the object which had
startled him

  by george he muttered mainly to himself i could
have sworn that i saw something move over there
something as big as the pyramid or ill eat my hat
but the unaccustomed exercise had the usual effect
within a very few minutes both men were emulating the
arabs example as to whether they like he slept audibly
there is no evidence one way or the other the auto-
mobile was the only witness

  as afterwards told by redpath and shaw the hour
when they were awakened was in the neighborhood of
three oclock and the moon had set each described the
event  the same language a mild earthquake very
much prolonged and accompanied by a fitful breeze it
did not awaken the arab he may have been accus-
tomed to earthquakes but both americans after look-
ing at their watches lay for several minutes experiencing
the sensation they were not frightened they were
not near anything that could fall on them each set it
down in his memory as an uncommon but not unpleasant
adventure

  within half an hour the camp was again silent pitch
darkness relieved only by star-light once more settled
over the place once there was a subdued crackle or
two from the auto as pieces of metal reacted to the
change of temperature that together with the ticking
of watches and the sound of three men breathing was all
that broke the stillness

  as might be supposed it was the arab who first awoke
in the morning the sun was yet an hour from rising
but it was fairly light already and the first the ameri-
cans knew of it there came the voice of the arab flat
on his carpet his face towards mecca as he repeated
the unintelligible lingo which he believed would save his
soul the americans listened without moving their
heads tn a moment the arab was done he got up
and rolled his carpet next second he turned around
and looked towards the west and his voice broke into
a terrified shriek

  allah is great great is allah and mohammed is
his only prophet

  and down he fell upon his knees gibbering the two
americans sprang to their feet startled looking at one
another in amazement then their gazes turned towards
the west and they saw

  the head of the sphinx was-gone gone completely
it looked as though it had been snapped off

  that earthquake breathed shaw his flesh creeping

  redpath stood as though petrified his gaze wand-
ered shakily to one side and he gave a gasp of awe

  you win he whispered and pointed a trembling
finger

  on top of the nearest pyramid securely planted upon
the flat space at the very summit stood the missing
head of the egyptian sphinx

chapter iv
the amazing theft

in collecting the data which is here presented the
writer has culled from the long list of unaccountable
events that were attributed to the nth man only
sufficient to make a chain strong enough to sustain the
astounding truth no attempt has been made to even
hint at the many peculiar incidents which a stricter
historian would include besides some of these incidents
are doubtful

  for instance the matter of hanging black crepe on
the statue of liberty on the night of july fourth 
why should people blame this on the nth man almost
any passing helicopter manned by a daring anarchist
could have committed this sardonic piece of sacrilege
the mere fact that the crepe was unusual material after-
wards traced to thibet does not change the situation
the stunt certainly was not characteristic of it

  so one had better follow the simple chain here pre-
sented this brings the series to  early in the
spring march  to be exact and the location of this
staggering affair was staid matter-of-fact europe where
nothing miraculous had happened for centuries more-
over whereas the preceding mysteries had had outdoor
settings this took place under a roof


amazing stories quarterly

  this roof covered a large three-story structure in
the city of hamburg germany the building some
hundred feet square and soundly built of steel and stone
housed the bank known to the world as the zollverein
internationale and although it has nothing to do with
the matter it may be mentioned that the roof was made
of very fine spanish tiling for the bank was designed
in a modified mission style hamburg took especial pride
in it

   on the evening previous to the day in question a man
of peculiar personality left a certain hotel about six
blocks from the bank and quietly strode down the street
it being almost midnight the man was given a quiet
scrutiny by two or three policemen each of whom al-
lowed him to pass without question after noting his dig-
nified bearing and the obvious elegance of his attire
seemingly a rich american tourist out  for a stroll
before turning in

  upon reaching the bridge over the binnenalster the
stranger paused and leaned on the railing apparently
lost in thought one policeman passed him there im-
mediately afterwards the stranger sauntered on shortly
arriving opposite the zollverein internationale

   there he paused and deliberately surveyed the struc-
ture two witnesses corroborate one another in this
the stranger remained nearly two minutes carefully
taking in every detail of the bank especially the heavy
grill work which protected the windows nearest the
vaults

   then he passed on reaching the next corner he dis-
appeared taking a turn to the right this should have
brought him back to the river further upstream and
in fact he was later seen three blocks away from the
bank studying the waters from the railing of another
bridge this time when he moved on he walked in the
direction of the hotel from which he had come but he
never reached the place he was never seen again

  only within the last few years has the truth about
this stranger become known his disappearance it seems
was a perfectly natural thing under the circumstances
for curious though it may seem this stranger was the
cause of the extraordinary affair of the zollverein inter-
nationale

  upon leaving the bridge upstream from the bank we
know now the stranger strolled for a short distance in
the direction of his hotel then reaching a street which
shall here be nameless he turned to his left and after
walking a trifle over two blocks he came to an abrupt
halt in front of a quiet unpretentious residence

   this house by reason of its standing on a slight ele-
vation overlooked a good deal of the city and in the
foreground of its view lay the dim white walls of the
bank

  the stranger cast a keen glance in each direction
before running up the steps then he gave an unusually
long ring to the bell followed by two more very short
and crisp almost instantly the door opened like a
flash he darted in and the door was as swiftly closed
all this without a light being shown

   once inside however the stranger quietly produced a
small electric light which he calmly switched on and
then handed to the person who had opened the door
this person a woman turned the light full in the
strangers face and for ten or more seconds subjected
him to a silent but thorough scrutiny during which she
referred several times to three photographs which she
held in one hand in the end she seemed satisfied

  come said she in german and led the way up an
old-fashioned staircase the man followed showing no
surprise when after reaching the top of the stairs the
woman led him down a short corridor and then began
mounting another flight in all this no light was used
other than that from the little lamp

   shortly the two reached a door on the third floor
the woman stood aside for the man to enter and keep-
ing his hands conspicuously in his side pockets the
stranger stepped in the woman followed and closed
and locked the door

   next moment she pressed a button and the room was
flooded with a curious radiance it was a deep red
light which came from concealed sources and the
man gave a startled exclamation

   fraulein you should have pulled the curtains
the woman smiled it was a slow patient smile
queerly distorted by the odd lighting effect she shook
her head

   nein mein herr the window glass is green in color
 and as you know red light cannot pass green glass
 the man made a quick gesture pardon me i might
 have known that you would be careful fraulein he
 looked around and selected a straight-backed chair of
 some old bavarian design he paid no attention to the
 other furnishings of the room which might be described
 as a combination of library and sewing-room your
 credentials please fraulein

  the woman silently drew from her bosom a small
envelope this she handed to the american who care-
fully examined the photographs and other data he found
apparently he was satisfied for he returned everything
with a curt nod

  he was perhaps forty the woman noted heavy de-
termined lines about his mouth and a coldly calculating
expression in his eyes a man to be reckoned with
certainly

   we may as well come right down to business said
the woman her voice as well as her appearance typifying
all that is generally associated with the autocratic classes
of germany you have come i understand to collabo-
rate with me in a rather extraordinary enterprise sup-
pose we understand one another perfectly

   very well agreed the american to put it in a
word fraulein i have been commissioned by a certain
american of vast wealth to bring about certain changes
in europe these changes naturally are such as will
benefit my client you see i am being quite frank
that is much the best way mein herr now-what
results do you wish to secure

   the overthrow of every republic in europe

  and-why

   that is my clients affair

   the woman nodded slowly quite so there remains
just one point how do you intend to go about it
there are two methods fraulein one is to induce-
he used the word with sarcastic significance-induce
various officials in these republics to adopt policies more
to my clients liking

   i am afraid softly that it is far too late to talk
 of such a method practically all these officials are
 honest strange though that may seem she paused
 i see from your face that you are already satisfied on
 this score

   the american cleared his throat i only mentioned
the method because i was instructed to do so you are
sure fraulein that it will not work

   quite

  no other way than your way

   none

   state it

the woman stepped to a table which stood in the cen-
ter of the room from a drawer she produced a
large tape-wound envelope this she placed in the ameri-
cans hand and quietly resumed her seat

   hill deliberately scanned the documents these con-
sisted of several closely typewritten sheets some maps
two charts and a small sheaf of memoranda within
the nth man



 ten minutes the american had caught the drift of it all

 by jove he ejaculated relapsing into his own
 tongue this is the right dope

 i beg pardon

 the fault was mine resumed the german i must
 say fraulein if this plan is of your making then you
 are an extremely clever woman

 she made a deprecatory move of the hands an expres-
 sion that betrayed her mixed ancestry unfortunately
 i am not that competent it is the work of another
 who fraulein

 who would one suppose

 hills brows contracted not-not the-

 she nodded none other even though in exile
 wilhelm is yet to be reckoned with

 you are quite right herr hill the plan is an excel-
 lent one it is complete it is sound it cannot fail
 given the money-your american money-and within
 a week germany shall be once more within the grip of
 her former rulers 

 the mans eyes flashed and then excitedly

 all europe one monarchy her face lighted up a
 few swift blows and-democracy shall end

 the american leaped to his feet by jove in un-
 mistakable delight he began to pace the room from
 time to time he stopped to re-read some part of the plan
 and to ask eager questions

 this overlooks nothing fraulein

 nothing publicity munitions-even telephone tolls
 everything mein herr the people have always bad a
 soft spot for royalty in their hearts all that is needed
 is-money

 hill came up short and suddenly wheeled upon the
 woman his brows narrowed with suspicion

 all very well fraulein and yet how comes it that
 you an anarchist are thus plotting to place monarchy
 back on the throne again

 she laughed a short and disagreeable laugh which
 showed an entirely new side to her character i really
 did not think you were so dense as that herr hill

 there are anarchists and there are anarchists a
 few fools are sincere in their desire for no government
 at all but the real leaders-pah

 we are merely a little more clever than you sup-
 posed herr hill

 you mean that you are really in sympathy with the
 autocrats even your anarchists-in america

 all who really count mein herr their function is
 to stir up violence so as to give your autocrats an ex-
 cuse to persecute the true reformers surely you knew
 of this before

 yes dubiously but i never could believe it
 fraulein in america we are apt to take things for
 granted

 he fingered the documents once more apparently he
 made up his mind at that instant for he turned abruptly
 and said

 we shall call it a bargain fraulein the money shall
 be yours

 the womans eyes glowed herr hill-you are will-
 ing that my organization shall do this

 fraulein the matter was left entirely to my discre-
 tion the man who is backing me gave me instruc-
 tions to go ahead if i felt satisfied that the plan would
 succeed and-i am satisfied

 good she swept to her feet when can we pro-
 ceed mein herr

 at once this very night

 the woman stopped short you mean-the money is
 already-at our disposal

 he nodded enough and to spare fraulein

 but - she seemed bewildered surely you can-
 not have so much money in hamburg mein herr

  he chuckled dryly you do not understand ameri-
can methods fraulein the cash arrived this afternoon
secretly by a fleet of submarines it was unloaded at
an underwater dock and conveyed by tunnel to the
bank

  the woman reached out a hand as though to steady
herself you have it all she whispered the
american gold-for which our cause has prayed all these
years

  enough to wipe out your national debt

  the woman recovered herself pardon she smiled
a little shakily but it is very-very unnerving after
one has waited so long good news-may be hardest to
bear

  you are willing then that i shall summon the com-
mittee

  of course curtly i am instructed to make ternis
only with the properly accredited officers of your or-
ganization

 and-when

  right now fraulein

  she picked up a telephone and gave a number pres-
ently she was speaking in a guarded voice

franz-this is bertha the eagle is ready for his
breakfast bring the waiters do you-understand
she replaced the instrument it is done herr hill
her face was wreathed in smiles now you shall
meet our executives inside the next half hour

  good

  the womans nerves demanded action she began to
walk excitedly about the room just as the american had
done a short while before and now it was she who
exclaimed

  you know not what this means to us-to me herr
hill it means release from that odious social democ-
racy it means that we who are entitled to the highest
places in the scheme of things shall once more come
into our own she laughed almost girlishly where
is the money herr hill which bank

  he strode to the window and peered through the
glass in the direction of the zollverien internationale
put out the light fraulein said he you shall see for
yourself

  she extinguished the red light and started towards
the americans side at the same instant there came
a peculiar sound from without it was a mumbling roar
like that of a distant surf simultaneously the house
trembled and shook as though in the grip of an earth-
quake it was over in a moment or so everything was
quiet and still inside two minutes

  what was that sharply from the woman and
she darted to the window where the american who had
managed to open the window was leaning half out the
room in the intensity of his gazing

  the woman caught his shoulder and held him fast
look out she whispered youll be seen

  and then on the instant the american gave a queer
exclamation as of fear he caught a hand to his throat
tottered and collapsed the german woman bent over
him

  his heart had failed him

  the woman straightened she turned at once to the
window what had caused the tragedy she stared
with all her eyes in the direction the american had gazed
towards the spot where the great bank had stood a few
blocks away

  the bank was no longer there it had disappeared as
completely as though swept from the face of the earth
nothing was left save the foundation walls and the
cellar money watchmen walls and roof had vanished
from the sight of man a small crowd of gaping citi-
zens was already collecting but the bank-was not
there


amazing stories quarterly

  as for the american hill he was never heard from
again he was buried by the anarchists who saw no
other way of escaping publicity and persecution

   and to this day not the slightest trace has ever been
found of the building or the contents of the zollverein
internationale

chapter v

where nothing grew before

so far the performances of the nth man have lacked
the quality of constructiveness that is to say the
miracles have never been more than corrective in
their effects upon man in fact some of the incidents
have been almost mischievous in their nature the stunts
bear many of the earmarks of youthful destructiveness

  so the next mystery-the last but one before the
stupendous climax to the series-shows a decided change
for the better in the mentality of its perpetrator per-
petrator however is a hard name for the unknown
benevolence which resurrected a dead continent there
are a hundred million people in this world who are
practically worshippers at the shrine of the nth man
because of what was done for them on the seventeenth
day of december 

  the circumstances will be easily understood by any
who have passed through an east indian hurricane
typhoons the natives call these storms the name is of
small consequence everyone knows that the stoutest
of ships never deliberately face one of them and the
electric freighter mammoth iii which sailed from van-
couver on the tenth of that month was commanded by
as cautious a sailor as ever handled a crew

  but not even captain mctavish could know as he
passed the marshall islands west-bound that a hurri-
cane was raging with such violence only a hundred
miles ahead that both of the philippine weather-planes
had been put entirely out of commission by the sudden-
ness of the onslaught so that some six or seven freight-
ers like the mammoth iii were steadily and confidently
forging ahead into an area of extreme danger mc-
tavish only knew that he was making good time

  the storm struck when the ship was yet a thousand
miles from new guinea there was of course the usual
low-pressure warning but it gave the captain scarcely
more time than to realize that lie could not hope to make
gilolo passage not in such a sea the wind too was
sure to become a thing to run away from not to bar-
gain with

  and an hour later saw the ship her decks as bare as
a plate scuttling before a wind that mocks all descrip-
tion mctavish was glad that he had a freighter in
the old days before aircraft absorbed all passenger traf-
fic the steamer might have carried a thousand passen-
gers each of them an enormous problem in the presence
of such a turmoil but the two dozen people aboard the
huge freighter were sea-farers

  a rare experience captain came a hail from the
wireless room as mctavish passed beneath the com-
panion-way it was the voice of young sanson the day-
shift radio man picked up five others so far all in
the same fix

  mctavish inwardly marvelled that sansons voice
could carry above the racket he could not know that
the radio man had been yell-leader for the cardinals in
many a desperate football game between stanford and
california the captain merely said

   looks as if the weather-planes have got theirs san-
son else we should ha heard from them by now
too bad i pity anybody up in the air on a day like
this at which the captain went away smiling grimly
to himself even the radio man was a true son of the
sea

   wherever the captain went it was the same all hard
at their tasks if anything more earnestly engaged than
usual for all that any man knew the ship might be
in momentary danger of going to pieces certainly every
joint in the steel-braced structure was complaining of
the extra duty but the humans made no complaint

  only one man down below was even curious as to
what was going on in the world outside he was a
young preternaturally serious chap who sat in the midst
of a wilderness of dials indicators meters levers and
handwheels the control of the ship was at his fingers
tips a telephone was clamped to his head also in case
of accident to the wires the good old gongs were also
ready for use

  wheres irons mctavish inquired noting that the
assistant engineer held the post there were two en-
gineers of course and irons was supposed to be on duty
nothin serious cooper

   i think not sir he said he had got very little sleep
last night due to an uneasiness which he always feels
when a storm is brewing i fancy he expects to relieve
mr seymour from time to time during the night

  i see mctavish started to go of course sup-
pose anything happens my lad lose no time in callin
him

   no sir a slight hesitation then is there reason
to expect anything to-to happen

  always in a starm like this but the captains
face was not at all anxious ye mus know m lad
that we canna see a knot ahead from th bridge tis a
matter only o keepin our wits for no mon knows which
way we go

   the youngsters eyes opened wide is it true then
the compass is worthless in this sort of a storm
weel suppose we ca it un-reliable at least it
tells us were headin mare sou than narth thats
somethin isnt it and the captains grim smile
brought an answering curve to young coopers mouth
he did not know that mctavish spoke the literal truth

  back on the bridge the captain surveyed one of the
windows the steersmans coat was thrust into the
place where the glass had been mctavish mentally
added ten miles an hour to his previous estimate of a
hundred for the winds velocity and securing a spare
jacket he started to fit it about the shoulders of the
man at the wheel

   instead of submitting however the sailor shook off
the captains hands im half roasting as it is he ex-
plained he glanced at the figure of his mate dozing
precariously in a chair at the other end of the coop
every half minute his head would droop whereupon the
ship would hurl him half out of the chair and back he
would crawl again all without opening his eyes i hate
to bother billy sir but if you dont mind-

mctavish took the wheel the sailor staggered
down to the cabin there to stand in front of a
forced draught and to revive within ten minutes he
was back much refreshed

  thank you sir by the way-for he was a cultured
young canadian that sailor-by the way whats our
cargo may i ask

  ye dinna know mon-ye should na come aboard a
craft except ye know her cargo tis-mctavish
stopped remembering that seamen were no longer
slaves of superstition but of science instead of finish-
ing what he had started to say the captain answered
the question

    tis a curious bit o freight lad the ships a travel-
lin nursery

  nursery

   aye th horticultural variety lad not th kind ye
were raised in
the nth man



  were carryin near to ten million trees an every
one is two parts grown aready all bound for th
narthern territory

  ah with a flash of understanding so australia
has finally come to her senses captain

  ye seem to know mare about it than mesel  cau-
tiously seems ye can tell me somethin 

  i dont know the whole affair sir but ive always
understood that the northern territory is rich in possi-
bilities only it hasnt had a chance for years it was
at a standstill due to the commonwealth refusing to
allow private enterprise to open a suitable railway into
the district

  lately however a syndicate has extended the line
north from adelaide past owens spring and woods
lake all the way to palmerston

  which same is our port interjected the other

  i knew that much anyhow sir well they also
built another line from perth north-east into the kimber-
ley country and from there over to palmerston the
work is barely finished to encourage the syndicate
the commonwealth had to donate every third section
but it will probably be worth while in the long run
so these trees o ours be destined t build up th
country commented the captain

  yes and i shouldnt wonder sir but that the future
of the country depends largely upon this one ship now
that i have started thinking about it i recall having
read that this shipment was raised partly under cover
at a cost of some fifty million pounds these trees are
-let me see-four years old sir the syndicate is
really banking on them if i understand the thing right-
ly unless by transplanting these trees it can get
immediate results along horticultural lines it forfeits
contracts of some sort with settlers upon whom the syn-
dicate is absolutely dependent for future support
queer muttered the captain i know now some-
one told me about it an i ha forgot i was worrit at
th time by hearing that th cargo were so heavy in-
sured

  i dare say rattled on the sailor his memory of
what he had read was now thoroughly awakened it
seems that the syndicate went to great expense to dupli-
cate the exact climatic conditions in their hothouses
which these trees must encounter when they are placed
in australian soil the idea is of course to take ad-
vantage of the recent rains and secure a foothold before
the dry season comes

  by doing this you see the desert will have something
with which to hold the moisture the trees have a head-
start hitherto it has been a hard matter to grow
things on account of occasional droughts dry spells
such as in the past have driven the settlers into con-
sidering imported labor the climate of course-

  tis na place for a white mon evidently quoting
someone in whom mctavish had confidence

  but these trees will make it very different sir once
let them get a fair start-and theres thousands of
settlers on the spot now fairly itching to get their
hands on this nursery-and the climate will become as
good as any in the same latitude

  i belie re yere right responded the other in fact
i know ye are ive heard a this before but ive had
ither things t think about th commonwealth will
lose th onl chance it ever had should anything
happen-

  he closed his mouth firmly and turned to go at the
same instant the sailor peering sharply into the wilder-
ness ahead of the ship gave a startled exclamation the
captain wheeled and looked

  breakers he roared put her over-quick

  the sailor was already twirling the wheel down be-
low the ships marvelous machinery was responding per-

fectly under ordinary circumstances nothing wrong
could have happened

  but a wind like that is not ordinary like a seaplane
approaching a beach the giant ship rushed headlong to-
wards the reef and before the vessel could answer to
her rudder before any human power could prevent the
stern of the ship was smashed smashed with a jar
that shook the freighter from end to end just as she
swung past the west end of the reef and the captain
did not need the report that was shouted up to him from
the engine-room

  great god sir the sterns a wreck  half the propel-
lers and the rudder-all gone sir

  the captain merely bit his lips next moment how-
ever he was hanging on for his life as the huge boat
helpless as a cockle-shell in the grip of that raging fury
thrashed about wildly her head totally lost and nothing
but a miracle to intervene between her and utter de-
struction

  god save us solemnly pronounced the scotchman
we canna last anither hour

the three men quit the bridge there was no use
in remaining there any longer and when they
reached the cabin they found most of the ships com-
pany there ahead of them only the radio man remained
at his post

   tis a thousand t one against us mctavish calmly
announced to the silent group that faced him my
best guess is that were nearing th solomons wi no
ship closer than two thousand mile good enough t help
us

  what say ye t a wee bit o somethin t eat

  and supper was eaten quite as though none realized
that the longer the ship remained whole the smaller her
chances became it had been a question of hours now
it was a matter of minutes but not a nerve showed a
sign of giving way although the strain of waiting is
the hardest strain of all

  it was each knew a waste of time to even think of
taking to the boats fine affairs though they were they
could not live ten seconds in such a sea no they
could do nothing but wait and make the most of such
additional life as might be granted them

  the radio man joined the group mate is fixing up
the reserve equipment he reported through a sand-
wich the regular outfit is gone west

  the last message captain was from the control at
manila said that my stuff had been received at six dif-
ferent places and the resultant figures out at very
nearly  east longitude and practically on the equator

  just what i guessed triumphantly from mctavish
he had dropped all idea of discipline in the face of
what was coming mare than two thousand from port

  pass th bread

  already darkness with the swiftness of equatorial
regions had dropped around the craft if her course
had been erratic before it was now unknowable

  a half hour passed with everyone wondering how the
ship could stand it another second she had sprung a
leak and was badly canted to the starboard presently
the captain cast an appraising eye at the wall estimated
that list and sighed

  weel ma friends if she holds togither that long
shell capsize inside o ten minutes has anybody got
one o those triflin cigarettes im out o tobaccy

  and it was then with the disaster practically in sight
that the mammoth  ended her cruise and at the same
time gave to the world the fifth of the colossal mys-
teries it happened while the captain striving to hold
on to a rail was maneuvering to light a cigarette for
the radio man

  jhe ship gave a tremendous lurch down went her
 	amazing stories quarterly

nose the captain held his breath she was going to
founder right then but next second he was staring in
wonderment at his friends

  the sea like a flash had gone still no longer did
the ship toss and shiver in the grip of the waves along
her sides the wind still shrieked as hellishly as ever
but-the sea was still

  by the lord swore mctavish reverently weve
been washed ashore high and dry

  he ran to the bridge with most of the crew at his
heels there they looked out upon-not the island that
the captain had expected but the sea nothing else
on every side as far as the searchlights could reach
only the raging waters could be seen except that these
seemed in that peculiar glare somewhat further below
deck than they had been before the appearance was
just the same as had met their eyes during the day
and yet the ship was still

  strange muttered the scotchman have we
landed on th top of a moontain

  before he had ceased speaking the ship began to
move it was a gentle motion from side to side and
up and down rythmical regular systematic it was
not like the toss of a boat in water it was more like
the swaying of a locomotive together with the rise and
fall of a horse but it was smooth for all that no man
could remain upright an instant without a stiff grasp of

sided altogether only a little wind remained what
had happened

  finally some went to the bridge it was getting light
enough to see and as they looked the truth very grad-
ually indeed dawned upon their incredulous minds

  and staring up at them just as incredulously all
about the ship were several thousand people whose
thoughts will have to be imagined they cannot be de-
scribed however there must have been some who
realized as they read the name of the supposedly lost
freighter that the future of australia had become mirac-
ulously secured

  these people today are among the hundred million
who are the nth mans worshippers today australia

 the ship was strnnsely quiet the roar of the sea after
     the lost thunder when the crash occurred had subsided
     altogether only a little wind remained   as they looked
     the truth gradually dawned upon their incredulous minds

something solid it was like no motion that any sea-
man ever experienced before

  not a soul got a wink of sleep that night that inex-
plicable steady motion continued until dawn with per-
haps half a dozen intermissions during which the ship
was motionless was it in the grip of some unguess-
ably big aircraft

  but the searchlights showed nothing but clouds aloft
there was no explaining the mystery the storm they
could understand but a thing like this that baffled all
understanding every man was sorely afraid-
just before dawn came the crash the ship struck
with such terrific force that everything breakable which
still remained whole was shattered into fragments this
included every electric light the crew hurled to the
floor remained for some time helpless and unmoving
waiting for the dawn to become a little less gray

  the ship was strangely quiet the roar of the sea
after the last thunder when the crash occurred had sub-

is a close rival to her older sisters among the nations
and it is due solely to the amazing fact which faced mc-
tavish and his crew when they looked around the ship

  the mammoth iii had reached port darwin more
she stood almost exactly upright in an open space about
a half mile from the sea palmerston lay almost within
hailing distance

  in some inexplicable way or other the giant freighter
had been transported through that awful storm a dis-
tance of over two thousand miles since nightfall the day
before and now she lay high and dry on the soil
which was to flourish because of her cargo

  the mammoth iii will never go to sea again but
australia has been raised from the dead

chapter vi
the greatest mystery

the sixth and last in the series of the colossal
mysteries takes our attention to china in the
year  the date is december  which is of
course the day before new years eve as now observed
by the chinese in addition to their own holiday this
fact by the way may prove more significant than it
at first appears

  and although the incident has nothing whatever to
the nth man



do with religious affairs of any kind excejt very in-
directly the setting of the phenomenon is to be found
in the compound of the congregational mission at lin
ching near the crossing of the great wall and the
river hoang-ho

  in the office of this mission which was perhaps
more a hospital than a religious school sat miriam
osborn a californian temporarily in sole charge of
the post surrounded by some half dozen christianized
chinese girls and aided from time to time by men of
the same conversion she was doing her best until the
return of her superior mrs walsh and there could
be no mistaking the immense relief in the young womans
face as after binding a dress upon a particularly dis-
agreeable sore such as many chinese are afflicted with
she dismissed the case with a hurried wave of the hand
and eagerly turned to the girl who had just entered

  well nama knowing that the young chinese would
stand there till doomsday without speaking unless first
spoken to what is the new-good

  yes - yes miss doctor rattled forth the girl
song fow who is up a-mong the tree is have seen
the missus doctors cart now com-ing

  miriam osborns natural impulse was to dart out of
the office through the gate of the compound and out
into the road there to leap into mrs walshs cart and
overwhelm that lady with tears and affection but dig-
nity in the presence of these grave decorous people for-
bade any demonstration instead she waited with an
air of great patience until all formalities over the two
women were finally alone in an inner room

  oh i am so discouraged miss osborn burst out
her mouth trembling as no chinese had ever seen it
tremble

  i seem to get nowhere mrs walsh not one in ten
remembers the simplest rules of hygiene and some
of the cases ive had to handle lately-well i thought i
had seen the worst a year ago but these are just simply
- and the girl shuddered

  mrs walsh was not in the least surprised she un-
derstood the delicate high-strung girl quite well and
the chinese even better and she knew that the young
doctor had been shocked too deeply to feel cuch relieved
by sympathy alone mrs walsh wisely put another
problem into her assistants mind instead her voice
was very sober as she spoke

  i know exactly how you feel dear i had to go
through with it all you remember several years ago
it is an old story to me now and lately i have come to
look deeper than those awful sores deeper than their
superstition and ignorance there is something that is
to blame for it all and-i think i have an inkling of
the truth

  miriam osborns personal troubles were instantly for-
gotten you have you really think you know at
last and the girl paused breathlessly she had al-
ways felt somehow that the chinese mystery was ex-
plainable if only she could understand these people
what have you found out

  merely an inkling as i said mrs walsh sat on
the edge of a bed miss osborn remained standing
but i think it may prove the key to the whole riddle

  you know that i stayed over at yokahama on my
way here she paused significantly well by good
fortune i met viscount soraki at the hotel

  viscount soraki the liberal whom you have always
wanted to meet

  he and he told me things-not too much for he
is a cautious man-but enough to let me form my own
conclusions as to just what he said i shall have to
give it to you from time to time as it occurs to me it
amounts to a great deal but my conclusions as gath-
ered from what he told me are these

  a certain well-known oriental government pur-
posely speaking guardedly is now an openly auto-
cratic one to put it in a word all our difficulties here
-all our problems of superstition ignorance and vice-
are due to the deliberate interference of that country 
you believe that miriams eyes narrowed with
anger the chinese are being kept back in order that
-these other people may dominate them

  mrs walsh nodded gravely through bribesy of
the native teachers and in other ways the chinese an-
cestor-worship is being kept alive were it not for
this our christian and scientific truths would soon be
adopted everywhere for the chinaman is a lover of the
truth and quick to change his ways once he is con-
vinced we are fighting-this other nations money
that night seated in the little garden around which
the buildings of the compound were placed the two
women discussed the facts that the progressive japanese
viscount had confided to mrs walsh in the end miss
osborn asked her superior if there was any hope that
the situation would change for the better mrs walsh
looked dubious

  there is just one possibility and that i am afraid
is very remote indeed i mean this if something tre-
mendous something in the nature of a national miracle
should occur the chinese might lose faith in ancestor-
worship and all the anti-progressiveness that goes with
it for example suppose some strange malady should
wipe out all the school-masters in every province such
an event would destroy confidence in these men and
therefore in what they taught and the way would then
be open for truth the truth of christianity and of
science to reach the hearts of-

  hush whispered miss osborn clutching her com-
panions arm the young womans eyes were dilated
with a curious fear hush mrs walsh

the older woman without moving cast a keen
glance about her and in a whisper as guarded
as her assistants she inquired what was it did you
hear something or-

  yes outside the compound a queer noise like-
like the thunder of a distant waterfall

  the oddity of the comparison struck mrs walsh with
peculiar force she gave the girl a sharp glance

  you saw nothing

  no but - the girl paused as though aware that
there was something very lacking in what she had said
she threw back her head and managed to speak in her
natural voice as she added never mind probably-
my nerves go on with what you were saying please
well i havent any more thoughts on the subject
as i say unless something happens to change the other
nations policy towards china something must happen to
change the chinese policy towards its ancestors other-
wise the future is even blacker than the past

  what do you mean by that in sudden anxiety

  mrs walsh bent and whispered in her assistants
ear the girls face went white her lips moved con-
vulsively and a single word escaped her

  war

  yes from the older woman with quiet certainty
and conceive if you can of great hordes of well-armed
obedient celestials under the control of that emperor-
overrunning the anglo-saxon world

  once more that strange feeling of conviction of moral
assurance that the truth had been spoken gripped and
chilled the heart of miriam osborn and a great wave
of grief as for the lives to be lost the misery to be
suffered surged over her and left her sobbing hysteri-
cally mrs walsh strong woman that she was stopped
and lifted her assistant and carried her bodily into her
room


amazing stories quarterly

  about eleven oclock that night following the usual
custom the two missionaries held a simple watch-night
meeting there were none but the half dozen girl con-
verts however to share the experience with them most
of the chinese were making the darkness hideous with
the usual celestial methods from firecrackers to gongs
fortunately the compound was located far enough away
from the racket not to be disturbed by it

  but just after midnight as the little christian band
prepared to disperse it seemed to them that the noise
in the village was inordinately great to the mechanical
noises were added the mingled shouts wails screams and
chanting of a populace that seemed to have suddenly
gone mad never had the natives been so noisy

  at the same time the missionaries became conscious
that the earth was trembling it was far from being a
serious earthquake but it continued almost without
ceasing for nearly half an hour at the middle of
that period it was severe enough to shake all loose articles
down from the walls

  accompanying it was a very peculiar sound it re-
minded mrs walsh of a great storm as heard through
tightly barred windows and doors it reminded miss
osborn of something else

  like what i heard early this evening she exclaimed
only ever so much louder but she admitted that
this time there was a rumbling crashing undercurrent
which was missing in the first place

  when it was all over having felt very little alarm
about the matter both women went to bed and slept
soundly in fact they did not arise till an hour later
than usual the next morning they ate breakfast with-
out the slightest notion of what had happened

  about eight oclock one of the teachers of the village
a wise man of whom mrs walsh had spoken as being
in the pay of the foreigners arrived at the head of an
extraordinary procession it comprised several hundred
men women and children they seemed to have been
gathered together within the past few minutes as
though on the spur of some mighty unseen impulse and
there was something so helpless so bewildered and un-
easy in their attitudes down to the last soul that neither
of the missionaries thought to feel any misgivings time
was when such a horde descending upon the compound
would have meant a massacre that morning however
both women instinctively felt that the mission was a
place of refuge not of mischief to the crowd that was
gathering outside

  i wonder what it can be breathed miss osborn as
she hurriedly got together all the available surgical
dressings she gave another glance through the win-
dow they are so quiet can it be some new epidemic
mrs walsh

  the older woman could not say somehow-i dont
know why-i think we wont need our kits today
there was a queer look in her eyes it is a hunch if
you will pardon the word leave your supplies where
they are

  wondering the young doctor obeyed the two
stepped side by side into the door-yard and they mar-
velled to see that every chinese who could do so was
crowding into the gate which had always been shunned
by more than half the population what could it mean

  missus doctor and miss doctor began the teacher
as though badly pressed for time we come-you make
him chlistian light away

  both women stood rigid with astonishment and stared
nt one another with unbelieving eyes mrs walsh was
first to recover speech

  what means this sing fo tan you want to be
christian just you pointing directly at him

  me he waved a hand to include the crowd behind
and about him all mes want-all chlistian

  something must have happened something perhaps
a change in the plotters attitude towards such as this
teacher mrs walsh could not know that a similar scene
was being enacted at that moment in each of two hun-
dred other compounds in that part of china she merely
stepped close to the chinaman and searched him through
and through with her eyes

  i believe you said she suddenly stepping back
there was nothing but eager helplessness in the celes-
tials wide open eyes come in then everybody-all
come in

the crowd swarmed into the compound miriam os-
born took a deep breath and signalled to her half
dozen converted helpers if only each were a hundred
times as efficient now

  but the enormous task was not begun before mrs
walsh herself dealing first with sing fo tans case
demanded what had caused the strange affair he had
no objection to answering but he stuttered lamely in a
pitiful attempt to find the english for his thoughts
finally he gave up and resorted to his own tongue
speaking very slowly so that mrs walsh could under-
stand

  we have come to you because there is no one else to
whom to go my people have come to me seeking that
which i cannot give and you must help us because we
cannot help ourselves

  the wisdom of our fathers is no more missus doc-
tor that which occurred last night has destroyed the
faith of my people in the things i have taught them it
has destroyed my own faith missus doctor none but
your faith can be strong enough to withstand this dread-
ful thing

  what dreadful thing demanded the missionary a
vague feeling of wonder creeping over her speak up
sing fo tan

  do you not know in surprise surely the missus
doctor has eyes with which to see

  and he rose and stepped to a window and pointed to
the north mrs walsh started to follow him but before
she could leave her chair one of the chinese girls came
running in it was the girl who had been charged with
the care of the wireless telephone the station being pro-
vided with enough apparatus to enable the receiving of
any messages from pekin or thereabouts the girl was
too excited to use english

  quick mrs doctor the voice machine is talking
it is from the mission headquarters in pekin

  sing fo tan must wait mrs walsh hurried into thtf
little room where the instruments were kept and the
moment she adjusted the headpiece she heard the fa-
miliar voice of the missionary who superintended the
district

  go outside everybody and take a look at the great
wall and dont show the least astonishment no mat-
ter what you see

  half understanding mrs walsh ran back and called
to her assistant the two rushed to the window where
the old chinaman still stood and each saw that which
made her doubt her senses and wonder if the day of
miracles had come once more

  the great wall of china that massive barrier against
the tartar tribes and equally massive barrier in the
minds of the chinese against the idea that anything new
could possibly be good-that tremendous and perhaps un-
equalled work of armies of coolies fifteen hundred miles
long and composed of mountains of stone-the great
wall of china that had by its very immensity blocked
the way of progress in the chinese mind for seventeen
centuries was gone it was effaced-annihilated

  the day before it had stood there a few miles north
the nth man



of the mission overnight it had disappeared the
great wall was gone

chapter vii
from  to 

when detectives and others began to investigate
the extraordinary events of which the chinese
wall incident was the last they invariably made a
list of the phenomena and carefully compared them in
the hope of deducing an explanation such a list cover-
ing the six episodes in their chronological order would
read something like this

  first in  the rescue of florence neil then about
nine years of age as said before this incident was
destined in time to exert a profound influence upon a
great many people its sequel begins in the next chapter

  for the time being it is enough to point out that this
rescue utterly inexplicable by any stretch of the imagina-
ton being quite beyond the powers of any known agency
whether of land sea or air-this rescue showed no par-
ticular amount of intellect behind the unknown thing
that performed it a childs mentality given the physi-
cal power could have done the stunt

  as for the second incident-the placing of that fifteen-
ton nugget on the deck of the cristobel off the coast
of chile in -a similar deduction might be made
a mature mind need not have been behind that in
fact one might say that the stunt was the work of a
boy who would naturally have a passion for privacy
buried treasure and the li-e

  but the affair in egypt in  when the head of the
ancient sphinx was broken from its place and transferred
to the top of the ryramid-that is not so easy to analyze
there is of course something childish about it but
there is also something decidedly pat in that stunt it
fitted the case astonishingly well was it not like some
schoolboys prank does it not remind one of the ridic-
ulous but clever things that sophomores in high schools
are forever doing

  the fourth episode when the bank was stolen from
hamburg under such extraordinary circumstances
bears out this theory it shows of course more ma-
turity of though and as in the preceding case it cer-
tainly was pat one is irresistibly reminded of high
school seniors and their dignified but distressing
escapades

  thus these four seem to indicate a progressive rela-
tionship as though their unknown perpetrator were
steadily developing during the years that passed

  moreover the stunts themselves show a certain pro-
gressiveness in the matter of mere size each miracle
is correspondingly more difficult more terrific in dimen-
sions more incomprehensible in the light of ordinary
knowledge in fact it was the stealing of the bank which
led to the series to be called the colossal mysteries

  but the fifth event leaves the investigator wondering
whether this progressivism theory is worth much
certainly the rescue of the mammoth iii and its puzzling
transposition from a spot in mid-pacific to an inland
resting-place two thousand miles away-overnight-
this challenges the mind to the utmost to even compre-
hend the vastness of the thing whose powers were thus
made manifest

  finally when the incident of the chinese wall in 
and its absolutely incomprehensible annihilation between
the setting and the rising of the sun is considered calmly
and in the light of the perfectly indisputable evidence-
for where is the wall today-when this staggering mira-
cle is weighed in the scales against the products of reason
it seems to overbalance all that man can offer appar-
ently it is beyond explanation how can any theory
possibly account for a display of energy so terrific bo

nearly instantaneous and so intelligently calculated to
get net results what becomes of the notion that these
mysteries are due merely to progressive development on
the part of the powers controlled by their unknown
author

   still astounding though the facts may be and unsatis-
fying though the progressivism theory may seem no
other theory fits the facts so well one cannot conceive
of any human agency developing such powers as are in-
dicated by such results and yet one is equally unable
to conceive of any other than a human agency behind
them the works are brobdingnagian-yet human

   all of which leaves us free to consider the events of
 when everything came to a climax and when the
world was treated to something even more astounding
than the six colossal mysteries

  nineteen-thirty-three what a year that was

chapter viii
ambition and the man

i

the magnificent residence of daly fosburgh in
casawaya has recently been purchased by the
state and from now on the estate will be a public
monument the reason for this will soon be perfectly
obvious

   even back in  the mansion was the chief pride of
the town it belonged to the most important citizen of
that exclusive little town of important citizens the home
of wealthy californians who were desirous of getting
away from burlingame and other places once consid-
ered high-toned but the common people had begun
to invade these towns so they had to be abandoned
just as the game of golf had to be abandoned by the
elite as soon as ordinary folk took it up but the year
 saw casawaya ranked even above san diego

  the mansion of daly fosburgh on the evening of
april  was the scene of a very extraordinary confer-
ence three people faced each other in one of the draw-
ing rooms and such was the tenseness of their attitudes
neither noticed the lateness of the hour-it was long
past midnight-nor any other fact than the topic which
gripped their attention

   the younger was a girl of perhaps twenty-one slender
piquant even elegant despite her conventional black-
and-white costume which proclaimed that she was one
of the many maids employed in the house had she
been attired in the fashion of the days bon ton one
would have admired her without reserve for her dainti-
ness her clear unspoiled gaze and the intelligent resolu-
tion in the set of her exquisite mouth and chin

  she contrasted sharply with the young fellow at her
side he was big and his complexion as slightly blond
as hers was a trifle dark his good looks lay less in
his eyes than in the remarkable regularity of his rather
large features a six-footer in perfect condition he
seemed about twenty-two he and the girl resembled
one another only in the attitude and expression of high
resolution which appeared to be directed against the
third person in the room

   this was a man nearly sixty years of age and bear-
ing upon him all the marks of aristocracy from his
tall slender figure to the way he fingered an unlighted
cigar his looks and manner proclaimed the out-and-out
patrician there was no mistaking the high forehead
the proudly arched eye-brows and the delicately modeled
white moustache and imperial had he been dressed in
any other garb than the conventional evening dress he
would still have been distinguished

  you do not seem to understand he was saying his
tones as distant and cultivated as one would expect
i am not questioning this young womans probity my


amazing stories quarterly

son i am merely forbidding you to have anything
further to do with her

  pardon me dad but i do understand rejoined the
young fellow i understand that you expect me to for-
get all that i have just told you and in a word discard
florence from my mind as though she had never en-
tered it

  but the thing is quite out of the question what i
have been trying to tell you all along is that my regard
for her is just as high just as noble-as your regard for
my mother

  what in a shocked voice as though blasphemy had
been uttered

  just that dad this affair isnt what you think it
at all florence and i-

  nonsense the aristocrat had regained his poise
there can be no such thing as a desirable union in this
case no one would ever believe that an affair between
a gentleman of your breeding and this poor child-

  child exclaimed the girl she drew herself up to
her full sixty-two inches i am old enough to be held
legally accountable for my actions and bert is right
when he says that nothing out of the way has occurred

k

the older man simply ignored her such cases have
been numerous enough bertram and they have
inevitably ended in disaster for all concerned at pres-
ent your set absolutely will not tolerate even the sug-
gestion of the idea you must drop it

  must the young man seemed to be having a little
trouble with his temper that is a poor choice of a
word dad

  it is not my word alone but that of a thousand or
more families which constitute the most cultivated ele-
ment of this country the patrician now held the situ-
ation firmly in hand and realized it and was at ease
let me remind you of your position in society bertram

  you are descended from a long line of the finest peo-
ple who ever lived your money-my money-was not
created in any vulgar fashion it was not secured by
speculation during the great war it was got together
by sound legitimate investment over a period of many
generations

  none of your ancestors has ever held himself inferior
to the highest ranks of england if we chose we could
have a title of our own even now instead for diplo-
matic reasons we prefer to let our caste be manifest in
other ways

  your station in the world is at the top bertram
the world was built as i have told you many times
primarily for the benefit of such as you and me those
who are so unfortunate as to be less well-born are en-
titled to no consideration whatever at your hands and
when you talk of marrying one of the servants in your
own household you are merely absurd bertram merely
absurd

  bert fosburgh seemed to have been expecting some-
thing like this you could say nothing else dad i
know you well enough for that

  but it is only in your opinion that this marriage is
undesirable i happen to entertain a different notion

  as before daly fosburgh carefully avoided so much
as looking at the girl now however he spoke in a
peculiarly impersonal tone such as he reserved for his
servants meanwhile keeping his eyes intent upon the
task of lighting his cigar for the sake of argument
we will assume my child that you think you love my son
sincerely that your affection is as noble as you claim
it to be we will take all that for granted if you insist

  but you forget that in the nature of the case my
child you are quite incapable of appealing to the higher
side of bertrams character appraising all your assets
at your own valuation you are still you must admit far

short indeed of the kind of a girl that you would hon-
estly want him to marry

  is this not so

  it is not flashed the girl she thrust an arm through
her lovers perhaps i havent been educated in art and
music but at least ive been taught the things that really
count

  i feel absolutely sure mr fosburgh that i can make
bert happy

  the aristocrat nodded for about a day and a half
sardonically

  the girl started to make a sharp retort then with
a sudden effort she recollected herself and kept silent
bert saw and instantly exclaimed

  did you notice that dad she can hold her temper
and thats just the kind of a girl she is all the way
through-restrained controlled and dignified

  id be pi-oud dad to marry her it isnt a question
of disputing your judgment neither do i disregard all
that you have said about societys claims upon me

  its simply this do i love her well enough to give
her ray name and is she-florence herself not her
station in life-is florence worthy as you say well
sir my judgment says that she is and my judgment
will have to stand above all else

  daly fosburgh let his cigar die out he sat down
and in silence studied the tips of his faultlessly mani-
cured fingers when he was finally ready to speak how-
ever there was no sign of whatever may have passed
through his mind

  bertram my boy you are stubborn i suppose you
come by it honestly all the fosburghs have had wills of
their own i find fault only with your judgment

  now my boy i am so thoroughly convinced of this
that i am going to prevent you from acting as you wish
you are not to many this child you are going to remain
single until a wife is found for you among the people

who-

  not going to marry florence

  no if you will not listen to reason you at least
will pay attention to something more effectual

the boy gave an easy laugh i have the law on my
side dad you cant prevent me from doing as i
please if i cant marry with your consent why then
ill marry without it

  you are mistaken imperturbably doubtless you
are thinking that having come of age and therefore
nominally into possession of your uncles legacy you are
now independent of me financially

  quite independent dad

  that is an error the cigar was lighted again
i shall contest your uncles will and see to it that you
are cut off without a cent

  again the boy laughed but this time uneasily the
court will have something to say about that

  yes everything as it happens the judge who will
pass upon the case is a personal friend of mine a word
from me and the matter is settled my boy

  ill appeal the case with sudden heat

  it will do you no good also showing a touch of
temper mr fosburgh hesitated a moment then and
i may as well tell you something now rather than wait
until later bertram that will save you the trouble of
telling me that you are prepared to leave me rather than
accept my dictation

  but before i tell you this child must leave the
room

  for a moment there was a clash of wills florences
eyes flashed forth what she had schooled her tongue not
to say but bert himself gently urged

  better do what he says flo see you afterwards
  the girl left immediately daly fosburgh resumed
the nth man



exactly as though the butler had opened a window in
order to drive out a fly he said

  my boy you do not know your father at this
bert looked up in some slight anxiety was-confession
coming you doubtless consider me to be little more
than a capitalist a dabbler in politics and a connoisseur
of rare books

   in reality i have as high ambitions as any man who
ever lived i have had these ambitions ever since you
were born and one of these ambitions my boy is to
see you rise higher than anyone else in america
well after a breathless pause

  for years i have worked and planned always en-
tirely under cover towards this end my financial
operations have extended much further than any of my
contemporaries ever suspected and it so happens that
your foolish affair with this nobody of a florence neil-
is that the right name-your affair came just in time
to see my ambitions realized

  go on

   a few days ago i should have hesitated to confide in
you today it is well that you should know what is
about to happen it will make it easier for you to appre-
ciate why i expect certain things of you

   bertram leaning forward and sinking his voice to
a whisper-bertram your father is-tonight-the
secret dictator of the united states i am its money
lord

  and you-you are to become its emperor

chapter ix
the coining of the nth man

tie foregoing took place about midnight of april 
at dawn the very next morning may day of 
the nth man first set foot upon the soil of north
america and today the nation observes the date as a
general holiday of as great significance as the fourth
of july itself

  the nth man reached san francisco at exactly six
oclock a great many people claim the honor of being
first to see him in all likelihood the number of these
people will increase with each generation until a time
may come when several million children shall be told
that your great-grandpa saw him before anybody else
did however that may be san francisco gets the dis-
tinction

   the first official news of the newcomer was telephoned
by a patrolman whose beat was on the heights north of
sutro baths this patrolmans name was sullivan

   all quiet was his report but theres a big man
standing out in th golden gate whot shall i do wit
him

  a big what standing where

  a big man sor standin in th golden gate the
irishman was evidently on the point of exploding with
excitement but he was determined that his captain should
not guess it whot shall i do wit him

  for gods sake what a hell of a joke go back to
your beat and quit your foolery

   beg pardon sor insisted sullivan tis no joke
theres a huge giant of a fella jist where im tellin you
he is he come out av th sea about five minutes ago
an hes been a-standin there iver since

   and thus in the matter-of-fact words of a policeman
the world was apprised of the most surprising event in
all history ancient or modern the nth man had come

  the city awoke mostly the news spread by word of
mouth for the soldiers at the presidio as well as num-
erous fishermen and others whose duties took them to the
neighborhood of the gate in the early morning had lost
no time in telling all who would listen and long before
any newspaper could put an extra on sale the popula-

tion of the city was pouring over the hills towards the
mouth of the bay

  oakland which by that time had outstripped san fran-
cisco and had become the first city of the west was slower
in getting the news but just as quick to act upon it
every available cross-bay craft was pressed into service
the goat island bridge being not half commodious
enough to accommodate those who had no planes and
by half-past six the greatest marvel on the face of the
globe was fairly surrounded by sightseers

  the nth man hardly moved from his position for the
space of the first hour he seemed to be waiting for
something and presently when a large helicopter arose
from the grounds of the university in berkeley and
made its way over towards the gate the visitors pur-
pose in waiting became clear

  the helicopter contained most of the faculty of the
college they comprised the most advanced minds of
the west and the world would believe what they said
and well indeed might the world wish to be assured

  gentlemen said the dean of the college leaning over
the forward rail of the airship and giving the nth man
another scrutiny gentlemen i am very glad indeed to
have you with me on this occasion otherwise i should
think i had taken leve of my senses

  and then he fell silent so did the rest of the faculty
and in stupefied wonder they gazed upon what stood
before them

  standing exactly in the middle of the channel his left
foot near the sausalito shore and his right leg looming
within fifty yards of fort point stood the vast figure
of the nth man from time to time he moved his
prodigious head so as take in his surroundings the
better otherwise he strongly reminded one of the
ancient colossus of rhodes the statue that stood astride
the entrance to the harbor of that name but instead
of standing a mere ninety feet in height this wonder of
the twentieth century stood inconceivably higher and-
he was alive

  it was difficult for the eye to appraise him at his full
value he was too immense he was so enormously
large that it was a problem to find any other large
objects with which to compare him

  was he taller than the spreckles building yes
much taller but-how much the eye could not
answer

  it was the people in the helicopter the professors
whose minds were somewhat more flexible than those of
the millions of gaping sightseers round about that finally
saw the newcomer in his proper perspective comparison
again it vfras the only way to appreciate him and the
dean himself must be given the credit for being the
first to approximate the staggering truth

  good god he gasped his face whitened and he
shook like a leaf as the stunning fact was hurtled into
his consciousness men-the giant-hes taller than
tamalpais

it was true the nth man overtopped the highest
mountain in sight

  of course the world today knows the precise figures
there he stood towering into a sky which for once in
the history of san francisco was entirely free of fog
his whole figure except for that part of his feet that
was covered by the waters of the bay was clear to the
vision of all those millions and they overlooked not
one detail

  especially did they note the curious thing which he
carried in his hands at first no one believed what
they saw then finally it dawned upon them that this
whole affair was real and that the giant was actually
holding an ordinary battleship in his arms not till
several hours later was it known that this ship was the

pan-asiatic super-dreadnaught siamese twin ii a
vessel of some  tons armed with the usual twenty-
five inch guns of the day as for the story of its crew
taken by surprise driven from the vessel and put ashore
on the farallones-that would make a whole book in
itself and should not halt the progress of this little
account

  and so perhaps one hour was too short a time in
which to appreciate the marvel before the eyes of the
west the thing could only be understood piece meal
it was too vast to comprehend as a single entity it was
the professors in the helicopters who hovering within
a half mile of the giant decided among themselves to
appraise the newcomer in just that fashion bit by bit
they could reduce him to understandable terms

  the dean elected to examine the giants eyes he
found them to be slightly small in proportion to the
rest of his features and while the balls were bluish
white the pupils seemed pure black the dean was
reminded of a poetic expression-twin lakes of fire-
and was startled to see a wonderful likeness those
prodigious pupils sparkling and flashing with some hid-
den emotion as the giant glanced this way and that were
certainly no smaller than small lakes

  but they were devoid of brows or lashes and the
lids instead of resembling those of humans were like two
tremendous shields of some hard brown material when
the giant winked which he did as often and as naturally
as any of those who eyed him these shields dropped
down in front of the pupils and of course flashed back
up again into a recess in the eye socket it was odd
but not disagreeable to watch the lids were merely
hard not soft otherwise they differed from the rule
only in size

  meanwhile other professors were examining his ears
these were found to be shaped like most peoples measur-
ing about as much from top to lobe as the height of
an ordinary thirty-story building they too seemed
made of that hard dark-brown substance

  the men who were examining the giants nose after-
wards wrote a treatise in which a combination of
roman and aquiline with a projection of fifty yards in
front of the upper lip was the way they summed the
matter up the outer covering was the same as the rest
of the face that unknown rigid material of chocolate
hue

  the mouth was said by the men delegated to pass
upon it to be the most agreeable feature of the face
of course humans prefer that the lips be flexible and
curving whereas the nth mans were rigid and straight
whenever he opened his mouth to yawn-he seemed nerv-
ously excited-his lower jaw merely dropped away from
the upper there being some sort of a sliding joint in the
hard substance at the corners of his mouth neverthe-
less the net expression of his lips was good-humored
curious though that may seem he was not grim at all

  the teeth were large white and in perfect condition
he looked competent to chew an ordinary oak tree with
greater ease than most people chew celery and the in-
terior of his mouth as revealed by those nervous yawns
was red and clean just like a mammoth edition of any
humans

  those of the professors who were elected to examine
his facial expression however were obliged to admit that
they were baffled they agreed upon only three points
the colossus was intelligent he was not ill-natured and
he was resolute

  his eyes certainly were those of a well-informed self-
controlled person despite their terriffic size and lack of
regulation setting his mouth as already said was
anything but fearsome but his chin a square straight-
cut promontory of unmistakable strength told instantly
of his will-power

   his neck certain professors later reported wa
 about two hundred yards in diameter possessed of a
 large adams apple and remarkable chiefly for its
 covering this was an extension of the rigid material
 which coated his face but on the neck this material was
 formed in three rings or layers which overlapped like
 the plates of a coat of mail but we are sure that the
 material was not metal it was either bone or leather
 of unexampled hardness

   the people who were examining his mighty torso and
 his terrific arms and massive legs came to the same con-
 clusion about the substance which coated these parts
 except for the flattened steel hull of some ship or other
 which he wore in lieu of a breech-cloth the giant was
 unprotected by any other than this many-jointed coat of
 scale-like bony brown-colored armor its true nature
 will be disclosed in due course

   thus perhaps one gets some idea of the nth man
 the battleship in his hands made him somewhat more
 comprehensible even though it did remind one of a toy in
 the grasp of a child for the ship was nearly a thousand
 feet long and the giant carried it with as much ease as
 most men would carry a gun

   again his fingers might make him more understand-
 able to those who cannot grasp the other details his
 hands were perfectly formed the fingers nicely propor-
 tioned on the backs they were protected by that un-
 known material inside the skin seemed much like
 elephants hide his nails were dark closely trimmed
 and ranged in extent from one to two acres

   the colossus is devoid of hair was another of the
 bits of description that have been handed down at
 least none was observed by reliable witnesses this
 armor of his seemed to have taken the place of liair

   and so there you have the picture of that stupendous
 man-for all in all he was merely a man on an un-
 precedented scale nothing else-towering into the sky
 overlooking the bay and the hordes of curious people
 who were fighting to see him conceive of his head sur-
 rounded by planes like that of an ordinary man in a
 flock of pigeons his mighty form rose to that incredible
 height with not one deformity to break the symmetry
 of his figure straddling-the golden gate

   his sheer immensity was overpowering small wonder
 f that so few have attempted to describe him the normal
 vocabulary had never been strained as it was on that
 day words must necessarily fail to convey an idea
 which in itself transcends mere language language
 is based upon experience and no experience had ever
 before equalled this the nth man even as he towered
 above the rest of mans works towered also above mans
 power to describe

    one little thing more than all else will help to bring
 the nth man within the comprehension of ordinary
 mortals like most evidence of great value it is indi-
 rect it is a statement of what the giant did not of
 what he was

 it occurred just at the end of the hour at exactly
 seven oclock when the sensation-proof clock in the
 tower of the university campanile was sounding the time
 the giant moved from where he stood and two million
 hearts all but stopped as the hitherto motionless colossus
 lifted first his right foot then his left and started
 forward

   the airplanes scattered like frightened birds a dread-
 ful sound arose-the mingled screams and shouts of that
 suddenly terrified mob but before panic could spread
 the giant turned around and took four tremendous strides
 through the water towards the ocean

   there he paused looking down the crowd watched
 in stupid anxious wonder as the giant keenly inspected
 the waters about his feet then he stooped and care-
the nth man



standing exactly in the middle of the channel his left foot	the sausallto shore and his right leg looming within fifty yards of fort

point stood the vast figure of the nth man  this wonw  of the twentieth century stood incomparably high  and he was alivr

 fully placed the battleship upright in the sea and from
 underneath one plate of his armor he plucked a brown
 object which he shook to the breeze

  it was a fishermans net or rather several of the
largest size fastened together the giant handled it
gingerly as though fearful of breaking it and when
he had got the fabric shaken out to his satisfaction so
that it hung from his fingers like a square of brown lace
he gathered the four ends together two into each hand
and bent down and dragged the net through the sea

  next moment he stood upright with his net full of
fish a squirming flashing silvery mass there could
not have been less than fifty tons in that single haul
and the giant holding the catch above his head opened
his lips and poured the nets contents into his mouth

  he chewed noisily for about three seconds then
one huge swallow and a quantity of fish sufficient to
feed a village for a week was gone down his gullet

  he repeated the operation again and again the net
was emptied while the people stood and gaped in help-
less wonder what if the nth man should fancy a
mouthful of them

  but nine nets-full seemed to satisfy him he put the
net back into its place and stooped to retrieve the ship
which had floated off a half mile or so at the same
instant the giant saw something a little further out to
sea

  it was the dorsal fin of a shark like a flash the giant
dove as a football player might tackle a runner and
the ground shook with the impact as transmitted through
the water at the same time the splash sounded with
such amazing loudness that it was heard as far south
as casawaya also the action created waves of such
height that every seal was washed off the rocks at the
cliff house

  the nth man drew himself to his feet dripping but
triumphant he had the shark by the tail he held it
high in air darting and twisting in his grasp it was like
a minnow in the grasp of a boy and the giant laughed

  ha ha ha

  a terrific bellowing of mirth which thundered from
up there in the sky a sound which took almost ten sec-
onds to reach the people on the ground and the echo
lasted over sixty seconds

  but the colossus with a swiftness incredible in so huge
a bulk although proportionately no speedier than that of
any other man flipped the shark into his mouth as
though the fish were a sardine one bite a swallow and
the shark was gone to join the other inmates of the
nth mans stomach

  and then still having uttered no sound other than
that overwhelming laugh the giant motioned for the
airplanes to get out of his way they scattered and
the giant started towards the east

  past the presidio he strode his feet stirring up roll-
ers that threatened destruction to wharves and all sizes

of craft he noticed this and moved more slowly and
carefully presently he stood opposite oakland and
halted staring down upon the city

next second he stooped and resting the tips of two
fingers in the space opposite the city hall the tips of
two others on a hill in piedmont park the giant leaned
far over and thrust his face towards lake merritt

there were a number of small boats around the edge
of the lake these the giant brushed ashore with his

-os-

chin then he sank his mouth into the middle of the
lake and drank it up

  and next moment began his extraordinary march
across the continent of north america

              chapter x
              gulliver ii

up san francisco bay he strode coolly stepping
over the goat island bridge and bearing north-
ward so as to pass berkeley and richmond at
every step his unbelievable legs covered over half a mile
but the giant walked slowly considering his proportion-
ate height his gait was hindered not only by the ten
fathoms of water in which he stepped but by sheer air
resistance

  as he passed the campanile at the university the nth
man almost without halting leaned over and playfully
twitted the uppermost tip of the beautiful structure
the monument shuddered throughout its length every
bell was thrown from its place the giant drew back
as though surprised and regretful of the mischief he
had done then went on

  when he reached richmond however his spirits
seemed to have fully returned bending over he scooped
a double-handful of water-perhaps half a million gal-
lons-up into the air as one playful swimmer might
shove water at another and richmond was treated
to an unexpected cloudburst which left its streets
astonished but clean

  on marched the giant past various small towns along
that part of the bay and not pausing until he reached
port costa there two huge train-ferries were at work
carrying freight from benicia to port costa the nth
man after an instants survey of what was being done
reached down and gently picked up both boats after
which he set them down each in the slip towards which
it had been heading by so doing he cut five minutes
from their time across and incidentally made a mess of
their schedules

  still keeping to the water which by now had nar-
rowed considerably the giant stepped past suisan bay
and collinsville his immense height enabling him to
easily distinguish the sacramento from the san joaquin
river he bore steadily upstream until almost to isleton
where the river channel became too narrow for his enor-
mous feet then he took to the land

  wherever he threw his weight there resulted a certain
characteristic depression in the earth sometimes it was
only a few feet deep where the soil happened to be
packed hard in other places his weight pressed the
ground to a depth of ten yards the shape of these
astounding pits is fortunately preserved intact in many
places so that we know the nth mans feet were above
five hundred yards long and nearly two hundred across
the ball with toes and other details quite in proportion
to those of an ordinary adults but his toe-nails were
exceptionally long and curved

  perhaps it was this experience of sinking with each
step that made the colossus walk so slowly again it
should be remembered that as soon as he took to land
he immediately had to watch every move he made in
order to avoid doing damage this took time otherwise
considering that he was over fifteen hundred times the
height of a six-footer he should have walked that much
faster which would have made his speed six thousand
miles per hour instead of the even one thousand to which
he actually attained

  but he took the most painstaking care with every step
frequently stopping short to inspect his surroundings the
better that he might make no blunders his eyes
located about a mile and two-thirds from the surface

were able to cover a great deal of territory and he had
picked a clear day on the whole he did not lose as
much time as one would suppose in his search for the
safest route

  ignoring the state capital altogether the nth man
headed straight for placerville he kept away from the
roads usually planting his weight where the results
would work the least harm to crops it was better to
harm vegetation than to interfere with traffic as a pit
in a road would have done inevitably however a good
deal of damage was done to cultivation a matter which
the giant seemed to carry in mind for just after reach-
ing the foothills he did a characteristic thing

  he stopped and built a dam the location was at the
foot of a small canyon fed by a creek near placerville
engineers had despaired of building a dam in that spot
for it had seemed to be too expensive a job but the
nth man simply broke the tip off a nearby peak shoved
it down into the narrowest part of the canyon and
walked on today that dam conserves millions of dol-
lars worth of water which is used by the valley that
bears the giants footprints

  presently he reached lake tahoe he stopped there a
full half minute squatting in order to see the place the
better apparently he enjoyed the view as much as
any other tourist and like many of them he decided
he needed a drink of the famous waters so he bent
down and sucked up a few gallons

  ah he observed with monstrous satisfaction

  but his drinking had caused a disturbance on the lake
such as threatened to swamp some of the steamers along
its shores not letting go of his own pet the siamese
twin ii the great man from the sea carefully steadied
the steamers with a touch or two until the waves sub-
sided

  he had been on the march less than fifteen minutes
and already had reached the eastern border of california
now he set foot upon nevada soil

  first circling past carson so as to cast an interested
glance or two at virginia city-apparently its history
was just as romantically interesting to him as to any-
body else-the giant bore off towards carson lake and
from there straight on towards the fast-rising sun he
must have known that austin was an absolutely dead
town devoid of a single soul now that its mines were
finally exhausted for he planted one foot precisely in
the center of its deserted shacks but he avoided
eureka and the many other well-settled localities along
his route and hurried on towards the next state

  fiften minutes after leaving tahoe he was in utah
he seemed eager to reach the great salt lake for he
almost ran while crossing the desert west of it and
shortly stood in the middle of the water thereupon
seeming to take great delight in the action he lay-
down and rolled over and over in the lake and when
he got up he went on with visibly renewed vigor

  bearing now to the south-east the nth man picked
his way as gingerly as ever past salt lake city through
the blacktail country and thence along the bad land
cliffs at the green river canyon he paused gazing
southward as though longing to follow its course but
he pushed on towards colorado reaching the border line
at  mountain time

his twenty-one minutes in that state was marked by
no particular happening except that while crossing
the backbone of the continent near leadville the giant
was seen to stoop quite low evidently he did this in
order to keep his head out of the rarefied upper regions
of the air this problem of an air supply must also
havf -v -ted to keep his speed below what it might have
bef

  aching kansas the giant made good time the
the nth man



air was not as transparent as that through which he had
just come or else he would have proceeded faster as
it was he passed kansas city at  central time
just a third of an hour after entering the sunflower
state

  and so the giant marched it wasnt practicable for
him to pay for such damage as he did it wasnt even
possible to avoid imperiling human life but there were
very few lives lost that morning on his account for
swift as were his motions the action of the wireless
was swifter

  presently the giant encountered the first of the fed-
eral forces this consisted of a fleet of two hundred
battleplanes rushed north from oklahoma to intercept
him the machines were provided with the most up-
to-date equipment and armed with orders from the presi-
dent himself this fleet met the giant as he was strid-
ing over missouri near chillicothe

  the commander of the fleet boldly drove his plane
close to the nth mans right ear and with the aid of
a megaphone the commander was able to make himself
heard

  in the name of the government of the united states
of north america he shouted authoritatively i com-
mand you to halt

  the giant heard and turned his head but he kept on
marching the commander shouted again

  i command you to halt dont you understand

  whereupon the nth man smiled broadly and nodded
as though it were all a huge joke and he kept right
on

  the commanders orders did not state what he should
do in case the giant refused to halt the orders merely
advised him to use his own discretion so the aviator
gave the giant another inspection

  that tremendous battleship snuggling in the grasp of
the man from the sea probably decided the matter for the
airman this and the fact that the very air was in a
turmoil so violently was it agitated by the movements
of this modern gulliver it would be hard to do good
target work with the air so unsteady

  so the commander decided that he had best follow the
giant when he looked back however he saw that his
plane was the only one of the fleet that had kept up with
that thousand-mile-an-hour gait his had been drawn
along it seemed by some sort of a vortex that sur-
rounded the nth mans head once out of that swirl
and the commanders five-mile-a-minute machine was
hopelessly left behind

  at the mississippi the giant stopped for a sip of the
muddy but historic waters veering sharply to the north
at this point he crossed illinois without incident reach-
ing chicago-or rather its environs-at  there
he stepped into lake michigan with unmistakable relief

  wheeu he shouted boyishly as he splashed in his
gargantuan fashion through the cold waters of the lake
wheeu

  hurrying past kalamazoo the giant soon reached de-
troit where he paused and stared in apparent astonish-
ment at the vast expanse of factories where all passen-
ger traffic having now gone into the air the product was
already simplified to trucks and planes but the nth
man had no time to spare

  leaving just two footprints in the soil of ontario
formerly a province of a separate commonwealth but
now one of the states of the north american union the
giant plunged in his business-like fashion into the waters
of lake erie the vast amount of traffic however im-
peded his progress almost as much as on land so that
it was  eastern time when the man from the sea
emerged dripping from the lake and started -oss new
york state

 at every step he met federal aircra	

with ordnance some only with authority one and all
demanded that he stop and one and all after a second
or two in the giants proximity were forced to fall back
unable to keep up with his terrific pace as yet no
demonstration was made against him

  but the further he went and the longer he remained
upon land the larger the crowds grew planes rushing
up for a fleeting glimpse of him flew over mobs as dense
as the land could hold the giant however made a
practice of walking where the ground was least crowded
hence most people saw him at a considerable distance
those who were nearer were those who had to flee as
he approached

  everywhere it must be remembered his tread shoo
the earth as it had never been shaken before his prog-
ress across the continent was marked by one continuous
earthquake even when he strode in deep water the
earth trembled steadily

  and every second that he was in motion the air was
reverberating with the hurricane produced by his pas-
sage hurricane however is a mild term for a disturb-
ance that would make a cyclone seem like a gentle breeze
such was the howling of that gale and the shrieking of
the wind it drowned out even the muffled thuds of the
giants steps the world had never heard its like before

  presently the man from the sea stood within a few
miles of albany at the bank of the hudson he stared
southward for a few seconds and the word shot through
the air to thousands of vessels along the river

   the giant is coming clear the way

immediately the march was resumed past the
numerous villages along the american rhine pay-
ing scant attention even to the palisades much less the
works of man the giant proceeded in his careful thor-
ough fashion down towards new york he reached the
city about  but to the intense disappointment of
the gothamites he did not pause save to snip the flag-
staff from the new two-hundred-story sanger building
he used this flagstaff curious though it may seem as
a toothpick

   taking care to avoid placing his weight on any of the
tunnels that lay under the bottom of the river the nth
man waded on past the battery at the statue of
liberty he halted long enough to take the torch out of
the hand of the figure and to replace it with a small
rapid-fire gun carefully abstracted from the battleship
in his arms the substitution gave the statue a very
different appearance

  as though the action were a signal fort hamilton
opened fire on him the shot passed above his head
and was meant to bring him to a summary halt he
did pause as though astonished but most certainly did
not halt on he went and next moment came the second
shot

  this struck him full in the stomach a tremendous
three-ton projectile which burst upon impact not a
tremor was seen to pass through the goliaths body it
was just as though an egg had smashed against a barn
door the hard brown armor was absolutely undam-
aged

   for the next twenty minutes as the giant covered the
remaining distance between new york and washington
he was subjected to a continuous bombardment from
battleships forts and aircraft thousands of tons of
shells bombs and armor-piercing shot were hurled
against that two-mile-high human tower and not once
did he so much as falter

   for although the most powerful weapons in the whole
world had been turned against that chocolate mail not
one projectile was able to get through here and there
where high explosive had detonated just right a dent

or a slight pit was to be seen in the stuff some of the
plates were made ragged on the edges that was all

  as for the giants eyes-the aircraft directed their
efforts against these if his sight could be destroyed
he would be made helpless each machine that could get
near him if only for a second discharged every avail-
able piece towards those oddly hooded orbs

  but the giant merely closed his enormous bone-hard
lids over his pupils and waded on afterwards it was
learned that these lids had been artificially pierced in
their exact centers with tiny holes too small for any
projectile to get through these apertures allowed the
giant to pick his way just as readily as ever and he
still took the utmost care with every step while cannons
roared from every side and the steel rattled from his
armor like hail from a roof

  could nothing stop him it seemed impossible cer-
tainly no ordinary warfare could get results against a
body whose weight as the world now knows the figures
ran up to a third of a billion tons

  but how about gas-attacks they were tried with
equal lack of success if a bomb exploded very near the
giants face he merely waved a hand as though some
evil-smelling insect were bothering him whereupon the
air was sweet once more to his nostrils clear once more to
his gaze a single drop that oozed from beneath one
of those shielding lids showed that the tear-gas had
had some trifling effect

  and thus it came to pass that when the nth man
stood in the potomac opposite the capital of the nation
the bombardment came to a sudden end the city would
be endangered by continuing the attack the gun-fire
ceased the aircraft drew away from the now stationary
colossus and comparative quiet settled over the spot

  down on the lawn in front of the white house the
president of the country stood an insect of a figure sur-
rounded by equally insect-like guards in the streets
and on top of buildings stood the greatest crowd of peo-
ple that the world has ever seen in the air close to
a million machines circled and hovered a hush of ex-
pectancy and then-

  somewhere a bell sounded the hour it was just one
oclock washington time the giant had crossed the
continent in exactly three elapsed hours having left the
pacific coast at seven oclock by berkeley time or ten
oclock on the atlantic it was incredible-but there he
stood and the waiting mob asked itself just this

  what is he going to do

  and so they watched and waited the giant stood
motionless perhaps he was tired from his three-hour
walk perhaps he was forming a plan at any rate he
made no move or sound for the space of over a minute

  then without the slightest warning he stooped and
grasped washington monument a gentle jerk and the
famous obelisk was uprooted whereupon the nth man
most carefully planted it upright on the other side of
the river in arlington cemetery

  as though satisfied with this display of his powers
the giant straightened up and he looked right down at
the white house lawn as for the first time speaking an
intelligible word gulliver ii thundered forth

  well now-its my turn

chapter xi
the nth man speaks

a shudder of apprehension ran through the crowd
as the bellowing tones of the monster crashed
down from the skies a shudder not without
reason the giant could speak english

this made him curiously enough a far more terrible
object if only this barbarous apparition from the sea

were ignorant stupid unthinking he might be trapped
in some manner or other but-he was intelligent

  so reasoned most of the millions who heard to others
however the fact meant just the other thing they
viewed the colossus wjth relief for it seemed to them
if this towering human mountain were a rational well-
informed being there was less to fear from him he
could be reasoned with

  however the monster waited about a minute before
making any sort of a move presumably he knew that
everyone was watching his mouth and so he purposely
waited until his exclamation travelled down to those on
the ground thus they might be the more impressed with
his size for as soon as the people at the white house
showed that they had heard the giant knelt and by plac-
ing his knees where the monument had been and resting
his finger-tips near the executive offices he was able to
bring his tremendous face to within a hundred yards of
the presidents all with the utmost care and in re-
spectful silence

  the president found his voice like any man with
nerve enough to assume such an office the gentleman
then president of north america was not to be out-
faced by even this prodigious thing

  who are you he demanded nervously of the giant
what is the meaning of this outrage explain your-
self at once

  the monster smiled it was an amused tolerant self-
assured smile which had the effect of further discon-
certing those who feared his intelligence and of further
relieving those who welcomed it he made no reply

  you must explain yourself repeated the president
the sound of his own voice braced him considerably
he was a noted orator and quick to adjust himself to
his hearers the mere fact that you disobeyed the
order to halt and were not harmed by cannon is no
proof that you can work your own free will with us

  if you have any case to make for yourself state it
at once you shall be dealt with fairly but-you shall
be dealt with rest assured of that

  a brave speech under such circumstances those who
heard knew that it deserved applause and several were
courageous enough to start a vigorous handclapping

  whereupon the giant smiling broadly now leaned back
on his haunches and joined in the blasting thunder-
claps of his huge palms effectually drowned out all other
sound just as the roar of cannon drowns out musketry

  down came the monster to his kneeling position again
he was quite at ease apparently he realized that so
long as he kept in proximity to the president he himself
was immune from attack of any kind and he waited
patiently until comparative silence was secured before
making any response then he said

 glad to meet you mr president he
spoke in an extremely gentle voice compared with his
previous tones it was all but a whisper what ordinary
folks call sotto voce yet the sound carried that
hundred yards between him and the president and filled
the poor gentlemans ears with thunder a little louder
and his hearing would have been destroyed

 as for my name and the explanation
of how i came to be what i am there is
no time to go into that now he plucked
something from beneath a joint in his armor it looked
like a tiny affair there in his huge fingers but when
laid on the lawn it appeared to be an immense metal
chest bound round with seaweed that contains
my history let it speak for me later

 just now mr president i have come
to make a demand if you like you may
call it an ultimatum

  the or  -sped so it was true this monstrous
thii	to force his will upon america and
the nth man



whereupon tho giant smiling broadly now leaned back on his haunches and
joinod in tho blasting thunderclaps of his huge palms effectually drowned out
all other sound just as the roar of cannon drowns out musketry

so far as they could see he was practically certain to
have his own way how could they prevent him

  but the presidents nerve outwardly at least was not
at all shaken his voice rang as courageously as ever
when he replied

  this government my huge friend will never submit
to dictation from such as you

  this demand of yours whatever it may be will have
to be something self-evident something that can be
granted without the slightest objection from america
or else you may consider it refused before it is stated
and i may as well say first as last that i cannot con-
ceive of any such demand

  as the president finished this speech he advanced
towards that gigantic face and with his final words he
raised his fist and shook it defiantly indignantly for
sheer stout-heartedness the presidents action probably
stands without equal in the annals of man

  the giant seemed to appreciate this he moved his
head ever so slightly in an unmistakable bow of respect
then he reached out one hand as though to motion the
president back to his former position it was a gentle
move but the president misunderstood and his nerve

public she is supposed to be ruled by
her citizens each having an equal voice
in her affairs

 practically however america is ruled
by one man and that mans name i am
prepared to state

  that is not true shouted the president instantly
this is a government of for and by the people
good for you mr president i expected
you to make such reply the man who
financed your election would be sur-
prised if you said anything else

 but the simple truth is that you and
everyone else in this country are sub-
ject to the dictation of a single man
that is false shouted the president louder than
before this time he spoke mainly for the benefit of the
surrounding crowds each american is a free-agent in
every sense of-

suddenly gave way he turned and bolted impotently to
the steps of the white house not till then did he
recollect that the dignity of a nation depended upon
him he halted wheeled and drew himself once more
into an attitude as defiant as he could make it and
the giant spoke again

 when you have examined my history
mr president you will readily under-
stand why i am making this demand you
will also understand why if you refuse
it i shall have to take measures to
force you to grant it right now i had
better state my ultimatum as briefly
as possible

 nominally the united states is a re-

  nonsense remarked the giant his voice effectu-
ally throttling that of the president not sense-
nonsense it has been repeated once
too often i shall not allow you to
hoodwink these people any further mr
president and it is high time that they
knew the facts

 but i cannot trust you mr president
to tell the people what they ought to
know i am not asking for a promise from
you i trust only the power of sensa-
tion of sensation such as i am now cre-
ating to awaken america to its peril

 i am now almost ready to state my
demands


the nth man

he monster paused and waited he fixed his great
eyes upon the president and immediately as though
the man could not help himself the chief executive took a
step forward and said in a wonderfully gentle voice
well what is this demand let us have it my
friend

 i demand this that your government
shall pass laws of such a nature that
they will reform the countrys finan-
cial system the purpose of these laws
being to forever put an end to the dic-
tation of any one man

  the president looked around helpless this was too
much of a load for even his shoulders and yet he
must make some sort of a reply

  such a proposal as this he finally retorted can-
not be settled off-hand it would have to go through
the usual channels before it could become law and
there is not the slightest doubt but that the people will
refuse-

 the people will have nothing what-
ever to do with it coolly from that enormous
mouth mr president you will immedi-
ately proceed to draft such a set of
laws and rush them through congress
in the usual manner when you want
quick action also you will take care
to make these laws absolutely consti-
tutional

 moreover they must go into effect
at once

  this was a poser and no mistake however-

  i see no reason tartly from the president why i
should pay the slightest attention to your absurd demand
not the slightest my enormous friend

  but assuming that congress should consider this
proposition suppose it refuses to pass such laws or
supposing they are passed what if i refuse to enforce
such laws on the grounds that they are unconstitutional
or discriminating what then mr giant

  the colossus slowly lifted himself to an upright posi-
tion had he moved at all quickly he would have smashed
innumerable planes that were hovering over his huge
bulk when he was finally upright again he waved
everybody aside while he moved back to his former
location in the middle of the potomac

  he opened his mouth and made reply then he
turned on his heel and strode seawards ten seconds
later these words rolled down from the heavens
you can do as you please about it mr
president i am going back to the sea
and shall not return for six months at
the end of that time i shall reappear

  in the meanwhile these financial re-
form laws must go into effect no one
man shall be able to control the coun-
try again i leave it up to you mr presi-
dent to pass and properly enforce
these laws

  but if when i return i find this coun-
try still dominated by daly fosburgh-
mr president i shall have to declare
war

chapter xii
america decides

the giant was gone by the time his final words
reached the ground his enormous form had dis-
appeared beneath the waters of the ocean back
to the sea he had gone and the world breathed freely
once more

  who was he was he really a human being like any

other man on earth save in the matter of size and cov-
ering or was he as others thought simply a huge
machine of some kind manipulated by a hidden intelli-
gence

  on the white house lawn still lay the great metal
chest that he had left he had said that it would speak
for him the people eyed it eagerly

  but the presidents wits were still intact he pointed
to the chest

  take that into the executive offices he ordered and
begin at once to decipher whatever you find but on no
account shall you make your findings public until i give
the word

  his secretaries hurried to obey and as will shortly
become clear enough there is small wonder that the
extraordinary message in that chest was kept from the
people for a long time only in the end was it feasible
to make the truth known

  there is only one question of any particular im-
portance just now the president told america in a
speech made that night that is the proposition which
the giant has placed before us what are we to do
with it

  that was the question what was america to do with
the startling proposal of the man from the sea

  informal investigations carried forward by indignant
citizens who disregarded all injunctions uncovered some
highly disagreeable truths the giant had been right
one man was in control the rest of the country was
dominated by daly fosburgh

  what to do about it a determined band of liberals
their sense of liberty thoroughly aroused by these dis-
closures energetically set to work to enlighten the
masses their efforts were astonishingly successful
the president through autocratic agencies tried in sev-
eral ways to provoke these workers to violence but with-
out results inside of two months the membership of
the financial reform league-committed to the giants
proposition-had grown to amazing size three months
passed before it could even be counted and by that time
over fifty-five per cent of the population was enrolled

  the government viewed this league in alarm and
when despite all that could be legally done to prevent it
the league presented an absolutely unanswerable peti-
tion at the white house the president could do no more
than to ask twenty-four hours time

  he called his cabinet he minced no words like
himself his advisers were all secret members of the
heavy hand and on the morning of august first the
people of america were told just what to expect

  the news reached casawaya about five in the morning
before six oclock every person in the daly fosburgh
establishment from its aristocratic head down to the
last footman knew what the government had decided

  and so it came about that florence neil knew almost
as soon as bert and his father that the united states
had decided to refuse the giants proposition to turn
down the financial reform league the girl immedi-
ately sought bert

  bert it means war war - with that awful
monster

  bert looked more or less indifferent to tell the
truth flo im not very much interested i dont care
which way it turns out ill have something to be thank-
ful for and something to regret

  i dont understand drawing him down beside her
on a settee i mean i want you to tell me again dear

  thats all i can tell you now sweetheart if the
giant wins out then i can go right ahead and marry you
and if he doesnt then-he suddenly drew her very
close-then ill have to get what satisfaction i can
from the situation into which my father intends to force
me
the nth man



  she already understood that he could not divulge his
fathers secret plans to make him emperor and she
did not try to make him break his promise she merely
said

  what did you say you could do if-if the giant
wins

  i can marry you

  then-tremulously-i hope he wins war or no
war

  and then because she was a woman and because she
loved bert very dearly she turned unexpectedly and
buried her head on his shoulder while he because he
was the right sort let her cry as much as she liked and
comforted her it did them both good

  in the meantime the government declared the country
to be in a state of war and appointed a censorship by
this device the financial reform league was silenced
its activities were officially condemned its leaders thrown
into prison its propaganda destroyed as seditious
all of which is very easy to get away with when a
country is at war

  the giant had said that he would reappear in six
months he had come on may day he was due to
return on november first there were just three months
in which to get ready for him

  for one thing the government tried to bring pressure
upon various foreign countries to aid in combating
this peril to civilization this horrible monster from the
sea but with one accord each and every nation re-
fused to give any help whatever to the one country that
had failed to progress she must fight the giant-alone

  all this while the nth man had remained totally out
of sight he seemed to keep to the deep seas around
south america africa and australia enormous fleets
of airplanes were kept constantly on the wing day and
night with orders to report any sight of the monster
but he managed to evade them all not till later was
it easy to understand how he did it

  the secretary of war was an exceptional politician
he had not waited for war to be declared before going
ahead with his plans but seeing that this was no time
to listen to precedent he concentrated on producing
something new in warfare something that could operate
successfully against an opponent such as no secretary of
war had ever before dealt with

  how best to fight the giant certainly not with an
ordinary army of infantry no matter how well equipped
with machine-guns and flame-throwers such would
have no effect against the man from the sea neither
was it any use to consider the navy ships could not
operate against a thing that could create enough waves
to swamp every ship afloat similarly it seemed that
aircraft-ordinarily considered the main fighting
branch-was useless in dealing with a monster who
could move faster than wings and who could turn the
air into a cyclone with a few waves of his arms

  as for electricity or magnetic waves the idea was
not even mentioned the giants armor was obviously
an insulator

  no the only hope lay in artillery not in ordinary
explosive shells either nor yet in gas bombs the
giant was too bulky to be concerned with any concoctions
that might be hurled at him all he needed to do was
to agitate the air a bit and thus relieve his eyes and
nose of the most deadly gas

  what sort of projectiles would get results obviously
just one the remaining possibility and nothing else
and the secretary of war maintaining the utmost
secrecy rushed work along that line and no other

  as for men to wage this new kind of warfare men
who could operate the hastily designed apparatus which
was to conquer the colossus-the government tried its
best to secure them by the usual drafting method the

method failed so far as the common people were con-
cerned the average american now fully realized that he
would be a fool to fight daly fosburghs battles so
without any violence or disorder each and every draftee
who would not be a beneficiary to daly fosburghs suc-
cess coolly and quietly marched straight to prison a
conscientious objector rather than be forced into the
ranks no amount of official propaganda was able to
inject patriotism into a people who saw that this patri-
otism would benefit only a single man and his favorites
they were willing to fight for their country they werent
willing to fight for daly fosburghs privately owned
nation

  so in the end mainly it was his friends and mercen-
aries who did the actual fighting there was no one
else to do it and when all is said and done the arrange-
ment worked very well

the actual chief of staff was of course the great
financier himself but certain infirmities kept him
from the field he supervised operations while remain-
ing quietly in his own home surrounded by wireless

  as for his son bert-my boy said general fos-
burgh when bert had come into the library in response
to his fathers request-my boy the time has come for
the fosburghs to show what they are made of the
worljis waiting to see whether we are entitled to the
respect we have always demanded and you see for
yourself-displaying his handsome uniform-that i
have made my choice

  will you follow my lead bertram

  there was an anxious appeal in the mans voice for
the moment he was not merely the man of ambition
with a longing to rule the world he was a proud
father anxious to see his son make good

  bert took a firm grip upon himself he longed
mightily to show his dad just how much he loved him
but this as the general had said was a time to show
just what sort of stuff was in him

  im going to disappoint you dad gazing steadily
into his fathers eyes as a fosburgh i consider it my
duty to respond only to the highest impulses within me
by nature i dearly love a scrap i should like nothing
better than a part in the fight and im as proud as
anybody

  but i want none of this giants blood on my hands
he is right im in favor of the reform dad

  and while rather than offend you i shall do nothing
at all to help the giant at the same time i cannot fight
him

  daly fosburghs thin lips twitched ever so slightly
otherwise he gave no sign he merely said in a low
voice

  i shall try-to appreciate your position from your
viewpoint-bertram you may go

  and bert went and immediately told florence this
time it was she who did the comforting the next day
bert claimed exemption as a c  and went to jail

  and exactly six months after his first appearance
exactly as he had promised gulliver ii came out of the
sea again and stood for the second time on the soil of
north america

chapter xiii
the one days war

there had been a great deal of speculation as to
where the colossus would emerge from the sea
would he come straight back to washington or
would he follow his former procedure and make an
overland march from west to east if neither of these
then which of the various other possible points of entry
would he choose

  puget sound many predicted he could work


amazing stories quarterly

more havoc there before being molested than at any
other point

  others considered that he might come up the st
lawrence and commence operations around the great
lakes still others remembering how unexpected all
the monsters actions had been insisted that the authori-
ties keep a close eye on the gulf of california hell
wade up the grand canyon and reach the heart of the
country before we know it

  but few believed that the giant would do what he
actually did it seemed as though he had used the least
possible cunning in entering at such a point surely
the forces of the nation could be more readily concen-
trated upon the mississippi valley than anywhere else
on the continent

  so there was surprise followed by elation and relief
when gulliver ii was reported at seven oclock on the
morning of november first to have show himself in
the river opposite new orleans he would be able to
do very little harm before an end was put to him

  the population of the southern metropolis was to the
last soul out of doors to gape at the monster and to
see the beginning of his campaign they noted that he
seemed little changed some thought he looked a trifle
larger but this of course is a matter not open to dis-
cussion certainly there was no change in the details
of his horn-armored enormously large limbs and torso
no reduction in the awe-inspiring appearance of this
apparently irresistible goliath

  he stood only for a second or so gazing down upon
the city then he spoke a few words and as he had
done when last seen he turned and marched upstream
without waiting to see the effects of his remarks pres-
ently these words thundered down

 i know the governments decision i
have no alternative than to declare
war from now on if i do any damage it
must be blamed entirely on the admin-
istration

 i shall march slowly northward if
your government still wishes to resort
to force i shall have to reply in kind

  that was all he said at new orleans its import was
certainly clear and decidedly disturbing the monster
seemed to feel that he would succeed and there was
no denying that the government had not thought to
apologize in advance for whatever destruction might
ensue but the giant had thought

  immediately of course the news of his arrival was
flashed through the air to the various authorities with-
out an instants delay-for all was in readiness and wait-
ing-the engines of the new warfare were started on
their errands of destruction each manned by determined
desperate but thoroughly competent though hastily
trained men and the world had never before seen the
like of that attack

  moving inwards upon the mississippi valley from all
points of the compass surged a fleet of three hundred
battle type dirigibles they flew from strategic points
along both seaboards from new foundland to tampa
from acapulco to sitka capable of two hundred miles
per hour and sailing at full speed they closed in steadily
upon their moving target

  as for the giant he continued his quiet saunter up
the mississippi taking all his former care to avoid
doing any damage upon reaching st louis he paused
and observed with evident interest the construction of
the new bridge at that point the piers had just been
finished when the monsters first visit cut operations
short leaving the nine sections of the bridge all
assembled but still on the banks awaiting the time
when the workmen would come back from on strike and
shift the steel to the piers all of which may have

amused the giant for the people of st louis heard him
utter a chuckle a deep reverberating note that shook
every window in town then stepping carefully past
the piers he reached over and picked up the bridge sec-
tions and after fumbling with them in the fashion of
a child assembling a puzzle he placed them carefully in
position on ue piers thereupon having accomplished
more in one minute than the builders could have done in
a month the giant moved quietly on

coming to the forks above alton he took the left
hand branch without any hesitation having evi-
dently made up his mind on this point beforehand on
he waded now in the bed of the missouri still taking
great care to step over bridges avoid all wharves and
shipping and to keep clear of almost all power lines a
few of these however he broke seemingly having over-
looked them and apparently being quite unconscious
either of the strong copper wires or of the thrashing
sputtering menace of the heavily charged conductors

  in this manner he ran away so to speak from the
dirigibles that were rushing from the east and south
but at the same time he was going out to meet those
that were coming from the west and north and so it
came about that when after leaving the missouri at
kansas city and proceeding up the kansas past topeka
the colossus finally stepped out of the water and strode
for a few minutes northward he stood at last not far
from the geographical center of north america

  and it was there the dirigibles found him erect in
the cornfields of kansas with atkison on the east and
nebraska a few miles to the north gulliver ii waited
for nearly two hours for his attackers to gather and
meanwhile he made just one more statement

 i would rather have picked a more
barren spot my kansas friends for this
battle but i decided that the affair
had best occur under such circum-
stances as to make it decisive your gov-
ernment will not be able to claim that
it was caught unawares it can have no
excuse whatever for attacking me
again

  he raised his voice and for the first time humans
realized what sounds this monster could make remem-
ber that he was more than fifteen hundred times the
height of an ordinary man and his vocal powers-since
sound varies as the square root of the distance-his
vocal powers were almost forty times as great as normal
that is his voice could carry forty times as far and
it did

 we shall need a space about a hun-
dred miles in diameter clear the way
at once

  it was more of a hint than an order the kansans
took it without question and thus we owe it to the
giants thoughtfulness that there was no damage to non-
combatants and so little to civil property

   the dirigibles swiftly tightening their circle about the
colossus were of course in constant communication
with each other the secretary of war himself was in
command and when a distance of fifty miles sep-
arated each ship from the central target the signal was
given to drop cargo

  down on to the kansas soil each alighting squarely
upright and all in position for operation landed three
hundred of the worlds most terrific engines of war
beside them a moment later landed their crews run-
ning straight from their parachutes to their posts so
well was the thing arranged and so carefully practiced
that within a single minute the giant was surrounded
by the cramm guns

  the day was clear the sun was just past the zenith
the nth man



by shading his eyes the colossus could take in every
bit of that ominous circle could see that he was in for
it but far from showing the slightest apprehension
he merely opened his mouth and roared

  dont waste time asking me to surren-
der i refuse to do so go ahead with
your fireworks

  the secretary of war on the bridge of the flagship
bit his lip in an effort to control himself he turned
abruptly to the radio man at his side

  his blood be upon his own head we can take no
chances with him its murder-but it cant be helped
fire

  the operator rasped the word into the receiver and
next second the state of kansas rocked throughout its
length as the earth received the recoil of that massed
discharge

  straight and true went every one of those three hun-
dred projectiles-projectiles made especially for the pur-
pose and totally different from anything that had ever
been used before

  they were each ten feet in diameter and weighed
ninety tons apiece they were not shot from ordinary
cannon but from electro-magnetic projectors gigantic
affairs some five hundred feet in length and enormously
powerful electricity fed through a cable from each
dirigible hurled the projectiles from each of these tre-
mendous machines

  rushing at the rate of a mile a second these ninety-
ton missiles flew intact to a distance of twenty miles
then as the secretary of war himself pressed a certain
button aboard the flagship each projectile answered to
wireless waves that discharged its mechanism where-
upon with a roar that was simultaneous in all the three
hundred shells these missiles became in effect aerial
cannon and out of their points shot secondary armor-
piercing shots each a yard in diameter and-absolutely
unbreakable

  there could be but one result when such missiles
struck no conceivable target could withstand the
enormous power of these shots they had been known
to penetrate fifteen feet of steel the giants armor
was worthless

  but very few of the three hundred ever struck the
mark for as though he knew in advance exactly how
the attack would be made the colossus waited ex-
pectantly until the instant the aerial cannon exploded
and then-he ran

  if his former movements had seemed wonderfully
swift they now seemed incredibly so he dashed straight
for the north right in the face of a hurricane of steel
and in exactly forty steps-the marks are there today-
in forty steps inside of twenty seconds the giant
reached the edge of that awful circle

  he had been struck in three places his leaping of
course had rendered that careful aiming utterly value-
less otherwise he should have been riddled

  one of these chance shots pentrated his right leg ap-
parently without touching a bone for it did not inter-
fere with his subsequent actions another projectile in-
flicted a trifling wound in his side carrying away several
acres of his armor which was buried in the earth when
it fell and could not be recovered for some weeks

  but a third shot pierced his neck it went through
his windpipe narrowly missing a jugular vein and lodg-
ing in a joint of his vertebrae all this of course was
not known until later

yet the nth man beyond throwing a hand to his
neck and uttering an exclamation of pain did not
allow this awful wound to stop him a great river of
blood flowed out each drop falling like a scarlet cloud-
burst to the ground staining the soil to a curious brown

and rendering it wonderfully fertile as afterwards
proved as for the giant the wound had only the effect
of making him mad

  he charged upon the nearest of the cramms it was
already reloaded-such was the excellence of its system
-but the piece was helpless its dirigible tossed about
like a cork in the cyclt-ue created by the giants leaping
had snapped the electric power cable the piece was
dead

  and the same was true of every other cramm each
of those three hundred dirigibles had become like a
leaf or a feather flitting wildly about the heavens im-
potent in the grasp of that hurricane not a cramm had
any power to use it was the one flaw in the plan

  the nth man may have known this and he may not
certainly his rage knew no bounds uttering only a
stertorous rattling gasp as he struggled for breath
through his shattered windpipe he bent and seized the
nearest of the cramms

   up he straightened an instant while he gloated over
the huge machine that now resembled a mere trinket in
his grasp and then putting forth all his prodigious
strength the giant threw the gun into oklahoma

  around the fatal circle dashed that raging monster
at every step scooping up one of the ill-fated guns the
second followed the first far to the south the third
and fourth landed in nebraska and when inside of
four minutes the last of the cramms was hurled into
the air the monsters rage was not yet appeased

   he stood there for a moment or so his chest heaving
looking around for other objects upon which to take re-
venge his breath came and went through that horrible
gap in his throat creating a dreadful wheezing rattle
so loud as to drown out every other sound

  for there were other sounds from the stricken
earth shivering beneath the nth mans furious tread
there came the united shouts screams and curses of
the giants enemies it was in the aggregate more of
a wail than a defiance no one who heard will ever for-
get the cry that arose from that army of smashed and
beaten humanity it was a cry to heaven from the
depths of hell

  only for a moment or two did the colossus take any
rest then again shading his eyes he peered around
in search of someone with authority there was none
to appeal to the secretary of war tangled in the
wreckage of his flagship was at that moment lying
dead on the banks of the platte to whom should the
giant state his demands

  he turned and strode directly east and presently
the terrified people of st louis were listening to the
tones of his now ghastly voice

  where is the president tell him to
come to me at once

   ten seconds later the demand was flashed into space
at washington it evoked an immediate response the
response was made by an official who had just learned
of the battle and who was so badly frightened that he
instinctively told the exact truth

  the president has run away he left secretly last
night and is now supposed to be on the pacific coast

  this message was received at st joseph and given
to a very brave man to deliver this man was formerly
a sea captain and possessed of a powerful voice and
as soon as he appeared megaphone in hand on the roof
of the santa fe building the giant bent down to catch
what he said

  he seemed to understand perfectly for he made no
comment but without a moments delay he turned
and started westward

  this time he took no care at all with his feet he
placed them wherever they chanced to fall fourteen
people lost their lives through failure to act quickly


the nth man

enough upon receiving the wireless warning but the
giant stopped because of none of that

  he travelled more than twice as fast as he had gone
six months previous he made only three stops and
each of these was barely more than a pause the first
was at a reservoir near denver this he emptied be-
fore his thirst was assuaged the second was at great
salt lake where he indulged in his second roll in the
brine the third pause was the longest when he
stopped at lake tahoe to drag nearly every fish from
its water getting barely enough to make a single
mouthful

  one hour after leaving the battle-field the nth man
stood again in san francisco bay and without any
preamble he bellowed again

 where is the president

  the mayor of san francisco as courageous a man
as ever lived but also as sensible knew that the only
safe course was to tell this living fort the absolute
truth a lie and the giant might reduce the city to
dust the mayor decided to sacrifice the president to
the greater cause-that of the citys existence

  you will find the president shouted this official
from a megaphone in the tower of the spencer build-
ing fifty miles south of here on the coast in a town
called casawaya he is hiding with some relatives

  as before the giant with the damaged throat made
no comment he strode right through the golden gate
turned to the south and swiftly skirted the shore until
he reached casawaya

  opposite the town he came to a stop this time there
was no need to demand his quarry the president
knowing by wireless of the search being made in despair
had resolved to make the most of it why not since
the game was up anyhow he showed himself on the
lawn in the plaza of the exclusive little city and ad-
vanced with such boldness as he could muster out into
the open in plain sight of the man from the sea

  the nth man saw him and as he had done six
months before he knelt and brought his face to within
a hundred yards of the presidents the effort brought
another gush of blood from the giants neck he
coughed and half strangled but managed somehow to
whisper with more or less distinctness

  you were a fool he informed the president
to decide to make war you ought to
have known that i am invincible are
you satisfied now

  i am satisfied answered the president heavily
this country cannot conquer such a monster as you

  there is nothing for me to do but to surrender
what are your-terms

  the giant paused he raised his head and gazed
slowly around at the crowd

  it was just noon there on the pacific coast for the
giant had come west at such speed as to make up for
the difference in time he had travelled faster than the
sun he had left the missouri at twelve-thirty what
conceivably would such a creature demand of mere
humans

 i am going to make just one demand
keeping one hand over his wound so that the escaping
air might not confuse what he was saying

 just one demand mr president i
shall ask for no promises promises can
be broken i simply make the demand
and stand ready to enforce it myself
if need be

 first i hereby declare that the
property of daly fosburgh with the ex-
ception of a hundred thousand dollars
is hereby confiscated second i further
declare that the demands of the finan-

cial reform league are henceforth the
law of the land

  the law of the land the proposed legislation-it
meant the end for all time of one-man rule in america

  and went on that remorseless pain-racked voice
to prove that my word is law i make
this demand as a personal tribute

 i demand that every man who took
part in the battle this morning-such of
them as survive-shall come forward
and offer himself to me as food

             chapter xiv
             the turtle man

      tho will be the first

    w the crowd stood in stunned silence with
  the exception of a few like general fos-
burgh who had remained on the coast to take care of
that end of the work most of the casawayan male pop-
ulation was scattered over the field of battle that is
the owners of the towns magnificent estates

  but their servants were for the most part on hand
the jails had not been able to hold them all out of the
two thousand souls that heard the giants final demand
scarcely one out of ten was in sympathy with the gov-
ernment-daly fosburghs government so to speak

  the general stood on his own veranda not far from
the spot where the giants right hand crushed the earth
some yards away from the financier on the lawn stood
bert taking in the scene with a curious air of detach-
ment although out of prison he still maintained his
original attitude towards the problem however it
ended he must lose

  florence as soon as the giant spoke his ultimatum
as soon as she learned that her former master was
doomed to a horrible death disappeared she had been
standing at berts right and when he first missed her
she was nowhere to be seen

  i think i saw her run that way said the butler
pointing vaguely towards the sea in reply to berts
question and no one else had noticed her

  bert let the matter stand for a moment he asked
his father the only possible question

  have you made up your mind what you are going
to do sir berts inquiry might have related to a
golf game instead of to the most awful act that a man
could be asked to perform to nourish that giant to
feed that huge maw but- are you going to show
him what a fosburgh is made of dad

  the aristocrats eyes were heavy with agony this
was the question he was asking himself as he gazed in
horror upon the waiting face of the colossus looming
like a barrier between the house and the sea what
should he daly fosburgh do in such a case presum-
ably if the commander in chief himself were to volun-
teer the giants wrath might soon be appeased should
he a fosburgh be the first to sacrifice himself

  i - dont know he faltered i dont know my
boy

  the monsters voice crashed forth again it is up
to you-either you volunteer you who
fought me or i shall run you down

 you have just one minute to decide
whether you die like men or-like rats

  the seconds dragged by no one could move or make
a sound from moment to moment bert glanced at his
father but the patrician torn between pride and unsel-
fishness could not decide

  as for the rest of the people of his type staring
there at the giant they were equally incapable of re-
sponse not one had nerve enough to lead the wayp
the nth man



to start voluntarily the process of healing the giants
sense of outrage it was the thing to do-but none
could do it

  the giant raised his head and looked around again
your last chance said he one second
more

  a breathless suspense and then with a sudden mo-
tion the giant reached out and snatched the president
with the fingers of his left hand the man helpless as
a fly in that terrible grasp seemed paralyzed with fear
the giant leaned back on his haunches and roared above
the cry of horror and dread that arose from all about
him

  run you rats-run you cant escape

  the giant dropped the president from one hand into
the other out flashed a huge red tongue and the next
second would have been the presidents last but for a
most extraordinary thing

   an expression of unutterable surprise swept over the
giants face he sat stock still holding his hands before
him and stared in pure astonishment at the tip of the
smallest finger of his right hand

  there crawling out of the crevice between that
enormous finger-nail and the leathery skin was the tiny
figure of a woman she grabbed the edge of the nail
and with a final effort drew herself up on top of it
as a gnat might balance itself on her own finger-nail

  it was florence neil somehow while the giant
rested his right hand on the ground she had contrived
to crawl into that gaping crevice and now she found
herself a mile in the air within hailing distance of the
nth mans ear

  you are making a great mistake she screamed
dont make food of these men its the worst pos-
sible thing you could do

   her voice shrill as a whistle carried down clearly to
the earth and her people stared astounded as the
giant even more astounded made a stuttering reply

  well you have a nerve little one
but-you havent said anything worth
listening to

   you just dont understand stormed florence find-
ing it difficult to get enough air at that altitude but
desperation lending her extraordinary powers let me
tell you-what i mean

  most of the men-you propose to eat-are not to
blame for their acts they are-the victims of mis-
representation  you must not punish an army-for th
sins of one man

  you mean daly fosburgh with a curious
uneasiness

  yes

   on his veranda the general stood as though paralyzed
he is there in plain sight-and it is he alone who-
should suffer

  at the same time i happen to know-that you can-
not eat him

  what did she mean a pause for breath and she
finished

  he is my-employer i have seen-your history
mister giant and i know-you cant take vengeance
upon-his body

  dont enforce your demand let things stand-as
they are with that mans billions confiscated-and the
new law-americas future will be perfectly safe

   it was the most remarkable speech in all history the
giant knew it and he knew that the girl had matched
sensation with sensation had appealed to him in a way
that none appreciated quite as well as he

   down on the lawn in front of his home bert fosburgh
stared upwards in blank amazement behind him his
father stood just as amazed but with another and a
totally different emotion surging within him as well

  the giant quit staring at the girl he looked off
towards the south hooding his eyes with those enor-
mous shields as he thought and pondered over what
florence had said presently he turned his head and
looked at florence once more

  then very carefully and with the utmost gentleness
he tilted his finger so that she could slide down safely
into his other hand he placed the president on the
ground and then held florence up even with his own
eyes

  for you little one yes i shall spare
these cowards

 and as for daly fosburgh-let him
keep his life and give up his fortune it
is enough

  you win little one

  and he set her down as though she were a humming-
birds egg in the hands of a child she nearly fainted
with the sudden change of air but she looked up and
somehow managed to smile

  the giant smiled in return for you he cried
heartily you nervy little mite

  and then with a single warning glance at the crowd
the giant turned and strode west in two minutes he was
back in the sea

inside a week the truth about the nth man was told
the data contained in the metal chest he had left
when compared with certain other information rounded
out his simple history in a manner that satisfied all
curiosity it amounted to this no more

  back in  a young man named george pendleton
was attending the california medical college in san
francisco he was then within a few months of matricu-
lating and being wholly without any independent income
he was still obliged to earn his living while keeping up
his studies

  he earned it by driving a car a fine limousine which
was one of eight possessed by the parkhurst family
this car was used exclusively by miss dorothy the
youngest of three heiresses to the great wealth and en-
viable social position of cynthia parkhurst and pen-
dleton was but one of a half dozen chauffeurs

  however the pay was good enough to enable him with
care and an occasional professional pick-up to put
him through school he had his mornings free by special
arrangement attending only forenoon classes after-
noons and evenings were at miss dorothys disposal he
contrived to do his reading at odd moments

  but most certainly his pay was not enough to justify
him in considering the notion of marriage nor even of
courtship such matters must wait he had told himself
until he had his diploma and had returned to the little
interior town where a practice made up of a wide circle
of friends was almost eagerly awaiting him

  all he needed was patience and for nearly eight years
his supply had served and meanwhile he drove that
car with all the imperturbable qualities combined with
careful mechanics that the most exacting mistress could
expeet and miss dorothy was exacting but pendleton
really was a clever driver

  there was just one flaw in his plans he failed to
take into account that miss dorothy in the years that
he had served her had been steadily growing out of girl-
hood and into the full bloom of womans estate so
gradually had the change come pendleton had not no-
ticed it also he failed to realize that all in all he
and miss dorothy were necessarily in one anothers
company more often than either was in the company of
any other person of the opposite sex

  now dorothys mother was an aristocrat of the aris-
tocrats her servants-some thirty in number-were

merely so many necessary evils in her sight she des-
pised them all and her daughters had the same creed

  that is all save dorothy the younger of the park-
hurst family was proud enough but she was also far-
sighted and imaginative she could see that in a year
or less her chauffeur was due to become a legally au-
thorized physician and as such entitled to the respect of
society and she was amazed to discover upon thinking
it over that of all men who had ridden at her side in her
own or any other car none had a fraction of the manly
intelligent qualities of the fellow on the front seat

  but he seemed totally unaware of her good opinion
she did not know that he who had first taken the job
with some nervousness because of having to protect a
child had grown to love her with all his heart he
himself did not realize it she was in his preoccupied
mind merely a beautiful child when one day the inevi-
table happened

   dorothy having instructed pendleton to drive her to
the country ordered him to stop at a certain spot on
the la honda road she wished to pick some wildflowers
she said and since this was a comparatively informal
occasion there was no footman beside the chauffeur
man and woman were alone

  pendleton helped dorothy over the fence and stood
respectfully waiting until she returned from the field
on the hillside it is doubtful if either of them had
the slightest inkling of what was about to happen

  when dorothy returned her anus laden with flowers
she found it much harder to get over the fence because
it meant going downhill there was just one thing to
do and pendleton climbing part way up the fence locked
his legs around a post and held out his arms imperson-
ally to lift this child back down to the road

  the spot was deserted except for these two and
next instant dorothy parkhurst amazed but blissful
was crushed tight to the breast of george pendleton
equally amazed and equally blissful

   they had a long and a wonderful talk that afternoon
they agreed that their affair must be kept secret until
pendletons graduation after that all should be well

  from that day forth dorothy developed a sudden and
devouring interest in nature she bought a small lib-
rary of volumes dealing with trees flowers birds and
even minerals her social obligations suffered but
pendleton didnt

  winter passed and spring came pendleton learned
that he would have to take some extra work in order to
matriculate and during the summer dorothy left san
francisco going far up into humboldt county where she
became a true woman of the outdoors for many months
the lovers did not see one another but each wrote every
day without fail

   it was towards the end of october that cynthia park-
hurst having written letter upon letter without succeed-
ing in arousing dorothy to a sense of her social duties
decided that she must visit the girl in person the visit
was planned as a surprise and it found dorothy unpre-
pared

  the mother could not be deceived and although
dorothy had hoped that she could keep her secret just
a little longer-georges diploma was due within a week
-she was obliged to confess to her mother they had
been secretly married and the child was coming within
a very few days

  mrs parkhursts pride was cut to the quick her
dorothy-and a mere chauffeur in vain did dorothy
plead that pendletons degree so soon to be achieved
would alter everything

  but even dorothy did not know her mothers heart
mrs parkhursts pride was not a pride of intellect hers
was a pride of birth there were innumerable mds

there could be only one parkhurst family to dorothys
mother a physician was merely a very highly paid and
very finely trained servant much above the average
servitor to be sure but-a servant as compared with a
parkhurst

  and the mother disowning her daughter absolutely
left the place with the spoken vow that george pendleton
would pay heavily for his insolence

thus it happened that on the very eve of his matricu-
lation george pendleton was informed that
through charges of irregularity in your private life
which nullify your otherwise excellent ethical standing
he could not be given his diploma also he would be
barred from entering any other college mrs parkhurst
had brought a certain very powerful influence to bear
an influence which will shortly be explained

  pendleton knew there could be but one reason in the
world for such an accusation obviously dorothys
secret was out and he lost no time in rushing north as
fast as the transportation methods of that day would
allow

  pendleton reached the little resort on the morning of
november first he rushed straight to the little cottage
which dorothy in company with a former schoolmate
had been occupying and when pendleton knocked at
the door it was opened by the other girl

  youre too late she told him in a hushed voice
he dashed inside and there on her bed lay his wife
dying she had taken poison and she expired even as
he raised her head

  an opened letter from dorothys mother told what had
happened to pendleton so dorothy had known and a
note in her own hand explained why she had taken her
life

  she had expected once she was the wife of dr pen-
dleton to go back to her people with her pride intact
now all this was impossible moreover she could not
think of burdening george whose career had been so
utterly blasted on her account with the care of one to
whom life now meant so little

  pendletons training had schooled him in a measure
to things like this he recovered rather quickly it was
but a few minutes before he made a great resolve

  he sent dorothys companion in a hurried search for
help as good luck would have it there were two
trained nurses on their vacations at the resort the
most experienced of these was brought and between her
and pendleton who was a doctor in every sense except
the legal one-between them the caesarean operation
was performed and the infant saved

  this child a boy was named park pendleton the
young doctor brought to bear every device of science and
common sense procuring the services of a foster mother
a spanish woman who had recently been widowed the
baby progressed quite as well as his normally-born foster-
brother

  with his prospects for a professional career com-
pletely gone george pendleton saw that he must either
change his indentity or leave the country in the end
he did both and after having discounted for cash his
share in a certain litigated estate he took the spanish
woman together with the two children and disappeared

  some weeks later a certain dr park accompanied by
his wife and two children arrived in the galapagos
islands perhaps it should be mentioned that these
islands are a group of thirteen located five or six hun-
dred miles west of south america directly under the
equator although now internationalized they at that
time belonged to equador and there the park family
made its home

  being a californian the doctor possessed more than a
smattering of spanish and his latin served to make him
the nth man



a very welcome and adaptable addition to the galapagan
colonies none but native doctors were there before
him small wonder with a population of less than a
thousand but the standard of living was easy prices
low and the doctor found the place to be ideal for the
carrying out of his resolve

   young park pendleton to give him his true name was
brought up differently from any other infant since the
world began until one year of age it is true he was
fed on human milk but when he reached that age he
was weaned and while he began to eat and digest his
food after the manner of other humans at the same time
certain elements of his nourishment were not assimi-
lated in that fashion but were injected in condensed
form directly into his veins

   as for this peculiar food it is first necessary to de-
scribe the thing for which the galapagos islands are
most widely known by this is meant the giant turtles
many of which are to be found in zoos throughout the
world these turtles or rather iand-tortoises are the
largest known to science growing to such immense size
that they will support the weight of a full-grown man

   moreover these tortoises whose food before they be-
came extinct on the galapagos was cacti and coarse
grasses are remarkable in other ways for one thing
they live to an enormous age some of those in captivity
are known to be over three hundred years old

   also it appears that they grow as long as they live
they never seem to stop growing nevertheless lon-
gevity and continuous growth are not all

   they possess incredible vitality the experiments of
sr redi an italian surgeon show that a galapagos
island tortoise can live for months after the brain has
been removed incredible though this may seem yet
there is a more startling fact the triple heart of such
a tortoise twenty-three days after the head was cut off
continued to beat

these experiments were known to dr pendleton
and he was also aware of certain other discoveries
somewhat in advance of his time for instance he knew
that the thyroid and parathyroid glands of animals are
of vast importance in the matter of growth the pitui-
tary gland located at the base of the brain he also
knew to be inseparably connected with the development of
great size in animals

   now the one-year-old boy became a living experiment
into his veins was injected the chemical elements which
filled the vital glands of the galapagos tortoise people
used to wonder why these turtles were killed off today
they may know	

  for park pendleton became the turtle man he dif-
fered from the unwieldy creatures in almost all respects
he was a finely developed sturdy baby with all the in-
tellectual and physical possibilities of the highest type
of human but in one or two respects he became a
tortoise

   for one he grew much larger than ordinary children
also-because the glands were used as often as the
childs system could stand the injection-whereas an
ordinary turtle would live a lifetime on a single set of
glands the infant was presented with fresh secretions
every few days and consequently the boy grew with
much greater speed than any turtle faster in fact than
any organism of the globe had ever grown before

   doctor george pendleton had once asked a professor
at the college doctor is it true that the average infant
is about seven-and-a-half pounds at birth 

 yes that is the average	 

   is it also true that the average infant will triple
its weight inside of a year

  usually they weigh around twenty-two at twelve
months

   well-i know its a foolish question doctor but it
may lead to something-why is it that a human infant
doesnt continue to triple its weight every year

  the professor looked astonished then the novelty
of the proposition was borne home to his imagination
and he contemplated the problem in all seriousness in
the end he said

  there really is no good reason pendleton why an
infant shouldnt triple its weight the second year the
third and each succeeding year no good reason gener-
ally speaking but when you narrow it down to a human
infant then of course nature simply will not do it-
without assistance

  and pendleton never forgot so although the boy
became a source of amazement and mystery to everyone
else the young doctor was not surprised at what hap-
pened

   the boy tripled in weight the first year quite as the
average infant does that is he weighed about twenty-
two pounds when one year old but thanks to the treat-
ment which his father administered the lad likewise
tripled his weight the second year that made his
weight sixty-six pounds and the third year his growth
proceeded at the same rate so that he was one hundred
and ninety-eight at its close

   as he increased in weight he also increased in width
thickness and height he was normally proportioned
he was different only in relative size at three his
spanish foster-brother stood just two feet and nine
inches park was already nearly twice as tall

  the treatment continued every available turtle in
the islands was sacrificed to get the glands the doctor
would have been hard-pressed for means had he not dis-
covered that the creatures yielded an excellent oil once
a demand for this oil was developed the natives slaught-
ered the tortoises right and left delivering the desired
organs to the doctor at the rate of a dozen for a sucre

  at four park pendleton was nearing six hundred
pounds he was not far from a ton at five and over ten
feet in height also his skin had already begun to
harden like a turtles

   mentally he was merely a child that is so far as his
judgment went but he possessed a prodigious memory
quite in keeping with his enormous skull

  thus at six years we find that the boy must have
weighed nearly three tons so that at seven the figure
would have been eight tons or more already his father
had been obliged to lease the smallest of the islands for
his exclusive use keeping the curious away by drastic
measures in this way the boys phenomenal growth
was kept from the rest of the world

   park weighed three times as much at eight as he had
at seven this made him about twenty-four tons at
nine his weight was seventy-two at ten two hundred
and sixteen he then stood almost exactly fifty feet tall
it was the year -and this marks the date when the
first of the colossal mysteries occurred

   early in that year the doctor had decided that he must
have a reckoning with his boy the lad realized of
course that he wos totally different from any other
and now for the first time he was to be told the reason
why

  you owe your life the father began to your
mother and to me to me however you owe even more
than to your mother for you would never have seen this
world had it not been for my skill and he explained
the caesarean operation

   then pendleton told his boy of his tragic love affair
as clearly as he could he explained cynthia parkhursts
tremendous pride and how it had forced her to disown
her own daughter

  but that is not all bitterly she prevented me


amazing stories quarterly

from getting my diploma she did it my boy through
the cowardly use of a peculiar influence

  this influence would be hard for you to understand
at your age i shall write out an explanation for you
to read when you are ten years older it is enough to
say that cynthia parkhurst prevailed upon daly fos-
burgh to bring pressure to bear on the regents of the
college

  this pressure was of a financial nature and that one
word finance brings me to the point

  my boy daly fosburgh is a great menace to the
united states today he secretly controls enormous
amounts of wealth year by year his control is being
extended until the time must come when he shall possess
a controlling interest in every enterprise in the nation

  it is inevitable i have worked it out with calculus
when you are old enough you shall trace every step of
the calculation and see that i am right in time the
united states will be dominated by that one man-daly
fosburgh-who prevented me from graduating and who
was the indirect cause of your mothers death

  the doctor paused for breath before going on

  now i am going to exact a promise from you my
boy the father was standing on top of a high cliff
in order that he might gaze straight into his gigantic
sons eyes a promise based upon the fact that you
would be dead were it not for me and upon the further
fact that your mother would be alive today were it not
for daly fosburgh

  i want you to promise me that when you grow up-
conceive of it-when you reach the age of twenty-
three you shall take vengeance upon the man who
caused the death of your mother and who ruined your
fathers life

  the boy was made solemn by it all for the first time
his manliness was aroused from that time forth he
was no longer a boy but a young man in his viewpoint
and he gave his father the promise

t will promise you he boomed across to pendle-
 ton it shall be my purpose in life to get even
with daly fosburgh

  what do you want me to do

  and pendleton went on to outline the plan it was
based upon the doctors careful computations by 
-when the boy should reach the age of twenty-three-
daly fosburgh must inevitably own a controlling inter-
est in the united states and it was obvious that he
would then be whether secretly or openly the dictator
of the land

  your work shall be my boy to put an end to the
financial system which has permitted one man to gain
such power i shall write out complete instructions
for you to read later by following them you will
destroy one-man rule in america

  and thus the affair really began thirteen years be-
fore the nth man first set foot on north america

  the doctor had already found it impossible to any
longer use tortoise glands enough could not be had
instead he had analyzed the food of the creatures dis-
covered the chemical combination which produced the
secretion and finally traced these chemicals down into
the volcanic soil of the islands themselves next by
setting up a smelting plant the doctor was able to sepa-
rate these elements from the rock and afterwards dupli-
cate the combinations he required

  so the growing boy was at the age of ten already
depending directly upon minerals for his development
his diet had even then become reduced necessarily to
sea food almost without exception and he was begin-
ning to test his powers

  it was the summer of that year when he took his first
long trip through the ocean reaching santa cruz far to

the north in time to effect the mysterious rescue of
florence neil once or twice he was nearly discovered
but he learned to hold his breath even longer than a
turtle and so escaped by diving

  at eleven years park pendleton weighed six hundred
and forty-eight tons at twelve he weighed almost two
thousand and stood a hundred and thirty-three feet
high no wonder he had little difficulty in placing that
huge boulder on the deck of the cristobel in 

  at thirteen he was about six thousand tons at four-
teen he was seventeen thousand and was not far from
three hundred feet high it was childs play for him to
play that trick with the sphinx childs play in more
senses than one

  he weighed more than fifty thousand tons at fifteen
a year later he was over a hundred and fifty thousand
with a height of six hundred and thirty feet thus his
chief problem in removing the zollverein internationale
bank was to avoid detection the stunt itself was easy

  at seventeen-when boys are at their most awkward
age-park weighed nearly five hundred thousand tons
this brought him up to a million and a half at eighteen
in  with a height of fourteen hundred feet it will
be noted that his height did not triple it varied of course
according to the cube root of his weight since he grew
in width and depth at the same time he was lengthening

  but his size in  was such that he kept almost
entirely to the water finding relief from observation
only on such barren lands as the australian desert small
wonder that he was interested in the mammoth iii and
her precious cargo and small wonder likewise that he
was able to perform this feat fourteen hundred feet
tall he carried the freighter gripped in one hand high
above his head as he made his way through the sea

  by the time he was nineteen he weighed four and a
half million tons by twenty thirteen and a half million
with a height of three thousand feet fortunately the
sea swarmed with food otherwise in that year 
he would never have been able to destroy the chinese
wall overnight and have thereby relieved the great na-
tion from the thralldom of its past

  during the next three years he continued to grow as
before at twenty-one he weighed four million at
twenty-two a hundred and twenty million with a length
of sixty-four hundred feet finally at twenty-three
when a boy ordinarily stops growing-at twenty-three
park pendleton also ceased to grow

  he then stood as the world now knows very nearly
nine thousand one hundred and ninety-eight feet high-
which is only a little less than two miles-with the in-
conceivable weight of three hundred and sixty million
tons he was coated all over with the bony armor of
a tortoise in all other respects he was proportioned to
a man of six feet and two hundred pounds

  as for his judgment that was neither more nor less
mature than most well educated young men of that age
but his memory was absolutely unthinkable

  for in sober truth the nth man knew everything
there was not one fact of any consequence which he
did not actually know by heart his knowledge was
that of every encyclopedia his father possessed of every
textbook of every possible source of information his
father died but the son possessed wireless apparatus
of his own set up on the barren snows of antarctica
he kept constantly in touch with everything that hap-
pened not one important fact escaped him

  so that there is nothing so very remarkable about him
after all considering the circumstances when all is
said and done park pendleton could have become noth-
ing more nor less

the nth man



  he was omnipotent mankind could not prevail against
him it was impossible to plot against him in any way
for with a mentality so prodigious he naturally was
able to perform psychic feats far beyond the powers of
ordinary minds he knew everything he could read
any mind on earth

  and today out somewhere in the pacific the nth
man still dwells an omnipotent enemy of injustice al-
ways on tap as it were in case humanity fails to do
what is right human nature must improve human
institutions must reform the turtle man is there to
see that they do

  he has never since come back to habitated lands al-
most every day someone reports having seen him in one
or the other of the seven eas but his mere presence
there is enough it will never be necessary for him to
return

  for america is now and for all time free from the
danger of one-man rule things are still far from being
perfect there remains much to be done before all men
are made happy but-dictatorship is forever at an end
thanks to park pendleton

  he will live at least three hundred years that much
is certain after that-for he has exhausted his supply
of chemicals-his fate is problematical he will never
have any progeny his father denied him the possibility
but he may continue to exist as do such turtles as are
in captivity apparently never growing old seemingly
endowed with immortality or he may possibly deplete
the ocean of its fish but this is unlikely vast as he is
the ocean is vaster

  there are those who think that the turtle man is
more of an allegory than a reality they conceive of him
as a promise of a condition yet to come when the cause
of justice shall grow to such immense proportions that
it shall become irresistible the trifling power of the
autocrats will become puny by comparison such peo-
ple see in the turtle man a promise of the time when
injustice shall be done away with when all men shall
be-masters of their own destinies when the weak shall
have been strengthened by the strong and right is
supreme

  be that as it may the fact remains that mankind will
do well to please the nth man let progress continue
as rapidly as possible no matter whose pride suffers
better let a few selfish ones complain than provoke the
turtle man to making another visit

  let him who would bring back the old days think
twice

	 

in the drawing room of the daly fosburgh mansion
an hour after the nth man disappeared three people
faced each other six months before under decidedly dif-
ferent circumstances and surrounded by an entirely dif-
ferent atmosphere the same three people had held a
similar conference

  but instead of a boy and a maid facing a haughty and
adamantine father this time it was father and son side

by side expectantly watching the face of the girl she
stood off by herself and it was she who was speaking

i was scared almost to death she declared upon
reaching the end of her account of her unprecedented
adventure but i was more afraid of failing than of
falling

 so-i just talked i guess

you certainly did talk agreed bert admiringly
there was a new respect not far short of worship in
his gaze it was a wonderful thing to do flol
theres only one thing i couldnt understand what
did you mean sweetheart when you told the giant that
-he couldnt eat father

 florence hesitated it was daly fosburgh himself who
 answered

 because of something that most people have forgotten
 my boy

both young people turned at the curious change in
the tones of his voice the last few minutes had in
truth amazingly altered the patricians manner his ap-
pearance his whole outlook upon life he owed his very
existence to the sheer moral and physical courage of the
girl who stood before him and he was only too glad to
forget that by her own admission she had been guilty
of prying into the giants history in fact it is some-
thing i have never told you before

 bertram-you recall your two step-sisters the park-
 hurst girls their mother was divorced from me just
 prior to my marriage to your mother

there was another daughter a pause dorothy

was her name she died before you were born and-

she had one son park pendleton it was he who
grew to be the giant he spared me because-i am
his grandfather

for some moments the three stood silent marveling
at the curious ways of fate presently the aristocrat
spoke again

my child-earnestly-do you realize that you are
the greatest heroine of all time no man could possibly
have done a braver thing

florence dropped her eyes too embarrassed to make
an intelligible reply but bert was able to talk

 i dont believe positively that any man would have
 had the nobility to go through with it

oh-almost wiggling in her confusion-lets talk
about something else

very well the older man slowly took a step
towards her my-my dear he seemed unable to

speak-my dear can you forgive an-an old fool

 the girl faced him joyous and radiant as she broke
 into a shaky little cry

you mean-you mean mr fosburgh-you mean that

you give your consent-to-

 i crave your consent he said to become the most
 honored member of this household

from which it will appear that she had to kiss two
people before she was through

fiemg monkey men

 by a jfyatt merrill

      author of the man who could work miracles through the craters rim etc

chapter i

jjalker impatiently tossed aside the maga-
zine he had been reading why cant people
write stories which are plausible he ex-
claimed in disgusted tones its an insult to
common sense and intelligence to print such
rot-such things never happen

  what things asked blake whats the yarn that
arouses your ire

  walker snorted about a crusty millionaire he re-
plied gets shipwrecked and floats about in mid-ocean
at the psychological moment a yacht turns up and a
sailor rescues the old croesus yacht belongs to a
society snob engaged to millionaires daughter sailor
turns out to be an impecunious rival who has shipped in
disguise to protect the girl from the dissolute chap who
owns the yacht of course the latter proves to be a crook
and the rescued millionaire bestows daughter blessing
and all on the sailor as i said before such things dont
happen in real life-no such coincidences

  while walker was talking belmont had entered the
room he had returned a few days previously from
south america where he had been on some sort of a
scientific expedition but this was the first time he had
joined us at the club

  i cant agree with you walker he remarked as he
dropped into a chair and no one has a right to say
what is possible and what impossible he added more-
over even more remarkable coincidences than those in
your story do happen ive
seen a lot of things which
you would declare impos-
sible if they were written
as fiction there was the
case of meredith for ex-
ample not one of you
would credit the story if
you read it in a maga-
zine

  we can judge better
when weve heard it said
thurston go ahead lets
have the yarn

  i heard the story on
my trip up from south
america belmont com-
menced while we drew
our chairs closer in an-
ticipation of a good story

we were lying off san
marcos belmont con-
t i n u e d and i was
leaning idly on the

ships rail gazing at the little red-roofed town with
its sea of unbroken green jungle behind it and the snow-
capped cordilleras in the far distance-an unknown mys-
terious world the haunt of strange beasts and stranger
men i turned just in time to see a man and woman step
from the gangway-iadder to the deck he was tall and
lean broad-shouldered and with a bronzed face and he
walked with the soft alert step of an indian or an ex-
perienced bushman at first glance i mistook him for a
native but he spoke to the officer at the rail in good
english and  saw that his eyes were of that unmistak-

at

able keen blue that spells anglo-saxon but striking as
was his appearance in this out-of-the-way spot i gave
him merely a passing glance for my whole attention was
riveted upon his companion she was the most beautiful
girl i had ever seen rather less than medium height
she had a superb figure and was obviously white for
her skin although a soft golden-olive was not lacking in
pink as are those tainted with negro blood nor did it
have the dull coppery tint of the indian strain neither
was it the sallow shade of the mestizo or of the latin
american her hair was lustrous bronze and her eyes
were as blue as the caribbean water along the shore she
was dressed in a plain gown of white linen her feet were
encased in canvas shoes and she wore a broad panama
but her walk she seemed almost to float along and she
had the carriage of a queen

  gee ejaculated peters the wireless operator who
stood beside me did you ever see a female woman walk
like that where the dickens do you suppose she dropped
from and whats she doing in this god-forsaken hole
with that old robinson crusoe

  i shook my head ive seen women walk like that be-
fore i said but they were all indians that girls no
indian and she doesnt look like any race of european
ive ever met either

    ill soon find out who they are declared peters as he
hurried off to find the purser

  presently he returned a disappointed expression on
his face he doesnt know any more than we do peters
announced says theyve booked as henry meredith and

miss meredith thinks
theyre father and daugh-
ter and some sort of
creoles although theyre
registered as americans
we saw nothing more
of the two new passen-
gers until dinner time
when they appeared at
the captains table with-
out her hat miss mere-
dith was even more charm-
ing and i saw peters
gazing at her with undis-
guised admiration

 meredith himself
seemed a quiet rather
taciturn man but with
a wonderful knowledge on
a great variety of sub-
jects and he conversed in
perfect english with the
captain and myself and
in just as perfect spanish
with the native passengers and waiters

  i really dont know what language i had expected
miss meredith to speak but her first words were in eng-
lish uttered slowly and a bit painstakingly as though
the language had been recently acquired and yet with
no trace of any foreign accent

  when addressed by one of the spanish americans she
appeared puzzled smiled and turning to meredith spoke
in some odd low-toned language utterly new to me in-
stantly he replied in the same tongue and then turning
to the others translated her reply into spanish explain-

 r a hyatt verrill has written a
 particularly interesting story in this issue
 having just returned from an exporing
 trip in south america where he has dis-
 covered a new race of people and having
 been on many other similar journeys his
 story becomes especially interesting be-
 cause much of what he writes is based
 upon fact

   from an anthropological viewpoint
 there is little fault to be found with this
 story for we are not at all certain that
 there are no such creatures living some-
 where on our globe

  this is one of the most absorbing
 stories we have read in a long time and
 the editor warmly recommends it to you

ing that miss meredith did not understand that language

  this unusual procedure increased my curiosity and
as meredith continued to act as interpreter for his lovely
companion throughout the meal i found myself marvel-
ing and speculating as to her origin and how it was that
she seemed to prefer the odd lingo to english

  after dinner the two sat together on the after-deck
apparently preferring to be alone but the next morning
they drew their chairs into the circle of passengers and
joined in the general conversation as soon as meredith
found that i had spent a great deal of time in south
america he gave me all his attention and having a com-
mon interest we soon were chatting away like old
friends i had always thought i knew something about
south america and its fauna and people but i soon
found that i was a mere novice compared with meredith
his knowledge was marvelous and he appeared to have
been in every nook and corner of the continent but all
the time that we were talking in the back of my head i
was wondering who miss meredith was and why she
spoke that strange dialect i didnt feel well enough ac-
quainted to ask personal questions and i didnt want to
appear rude or curious but at last meredith himself
brought the matter up he had just repeated in the odd
tongue something i had said and then turning to me
he apologized for speaking in a language unintelligible
to me remarking by way of explanation that miss mere-
dith did not readily understand english as she had only
recently learned to speak it

   she speaks it charmingly i replied but ive been
wondering what language it is that she prefers-i can-
not seem to place it and i know most of the european
dialects

   its not european laughed meredith its tucumari
-an indian dialect perhaps you never heard of it

   no i never did i admitted but then i added i
know very few of the indian dialects but if its not too
personal a question may i ask how miss meredith hap-
pens to be so familiar with an indian tongue i suppose
her nurse-

   no he interrupted i do not think any tucumari
has ever visited the most remote outposts of civilization
to all intents and purposes they are an unknown tribe
its a long story by the way did you ever hear of the
waupona bird or the monkey-men

   i never heard of the bird i told him at least not by
that name but ive heard stories of the monkey-men-
purely imaginary and fantastic tales of the indians of
course

  meredith smiled its a dangerous thing to condemn
anything as purely fantastic unless we are sure he re-
marked as he rose excuse me a moment he added
id like to show you a specimen i have in my room

  a moment later he returned with a long slender
package wrapped in bark-cloth unrolling this he dis-
closed a magnificent feather head-dress composed of the
most remarkable and beautiful feathers i have ever seen
attached to a band of dyed or stained bark-cloth were
fully one hundred feathers varying in length from wav-
ing plumes over three feet long to short curved delicate
feathers a few inches in length and each and every one
a brilliant gleaming royal-purple color that changed to
mauve violet ana magenta shades as they swayed gently
in the breeze in size texture and form the feathers
were like those from the sacred quetzal bird of central
america but a thousand times more beautiful than the
emerald green plumes of that famed trogan

  i fairly gaped with astonishment and admiration at
the sight where in the world did you run across that
i cried and from what marvelous bird were those
feathers obtained

 the feathers replied meredith are from the wau-
pona bird and the head-dress is the crown of the king

of the monkey-men i may add that i took it from the
kings head with my own hands so theres nothing either
imaginary or fantastic about it its a long story as i
said but if youd like to hear it very well

  as he spoke meredith reached over and placed the
feather crown on the girls head and said something in
tucumari crowned with the marvelous purple diadem
she seemed transformed into some incan or aztec prin-
cess and as meredith related the story of their adven-
tures i listened spell-bound for the tale was more won-
derful than any fiction

   do you remember the wreck of the river steamer
magdalena he asked i nodded it was a terrible catas-
trophe i said as i recollect it not one of her crew or
passengers escaped

   among the passengers continued meredith was my
motherless two year-old daughter ruth in charge of a
trusted nurse the shocking news reached me at caura
and i at once led a searching party to the scene of the
disaster but not a survivor could be found not even a
body could be recovered the perai fish and alligators
destroyed all evidences of the victims fate in an effort
to forget my awful loss i resumed my former profession
of field naturalist and for the next fifteen years i spent
my life in the bush often of course i penetrated to
unknown and unexplored districts and on my last trip
i found myself in a remote region upon one of the great
forest rivers fully three hundred miles from the coast
and from all traces of civilization my only companions
were my two boatmen pepe a pure blooded indian and
jos a mestizo everything had gone smoothly and with-
out any unusual incident and as the river narrowed and
the current quickened we realized that we were ap-
proaching the highlands and the limits of navigable
water suddenly ppe in the bow stopped paddling and
held up his hand for silence then as we floated motion-
less we caught the faint sounds of human voices from
beyond a wooded point

   slowly and cautiously we moved forward to the
screen of branches and peered through the foliage be-
yond the point the stream swept in a half-circle along
a narrow beach under a bank crowned with huge trees
upon the beach were a number of dug-outs and upon
the bank were a dozen or more thatched huts here and
there the naked forms of indians were visible and beside
the nearest canoe were two men one braiding a bark
rope the other daubing pitch on the craft it was their
voices we had heard but the dialect was strange to me
presently ppe turned it is well senor he whisp-
ered they speak the metaki and are my people

   as he finished he shouted words in his own tongue
and we paddled into view as we emerged from our hid-
ing place each of the indians on the beach grasped his
blowgun and stood ready to use his poisoned darts if
necessity arose but a few words from ppe reassured
them the weapons were laid aside and as our canoe
touched the shore the two savages grasped the gun-
wales and rushed it up the beach

  instantly all was commotion in the village and as
we stepped ashore we were surrounded by a crowd of
chattering wondering indians of both sexes and all ages
for it was the first time they had ever seen civilized men
to their innumerable comments and questions pepe re-
plied in his own language presently jos too was talk-
ing using a distinct dialect which the metakis seemed
to understand

   now and then i could catch a word but most of it
was unintelligible to me and addressing ppe and jos
i asked them if none of the indians could speak any
dialect i knew at my words scowls and black looks
spread over the faces of some of the men and i realized
that they had understood my words and-were suspicious
when they heard spanish but presently as ppe spoke
the king of the monkey men



with them their faces cleared si sefior he said
turning to me  several speak atami and some under-
stand spanish they say all spaniards are bad and are
to be killed i tell them you are from another land
and of a race who fought with the spaniards and that
you are a friend and have presents

   the distribution of a few gifts cemented the friend-
ship of the metakis a new palm hut was built for me
and we soon felt quite at home i had already decided to
remain at the village for some time as it was an ex-
cellent spot for collecting and melanga the cacique who
spoke atami was a friendly old chap and appeared much
interested in my work

   i had lived among the metakis for some time and
had secured many fine things when i made a notable dis-
covery i was visiting melanga and noticed a number
of feather crowns and girdles hanging on the rear wall
of his hut stepping nearer to examine them-for quite
frequently rare or new birds may be found among the
indians ornaments i saw among the ordinary toucan
parrot and macaw feathers a bunch of plumes of won-
derful purple they were unlike anything i had ever
seen and i knew instantly that they were from some un-
described species of bird turning to the cacique i asked
from what bird they were taken

    they are from waupona  he replied  the
king of birds and are to be worn only by chiefs in time
of war or at great ceremonies

  the waupona i asked i have never heard the
name tell me where lives this king birds why
have your hunters never taken one for me

  listen and i will tell you replied melanga
 many days travel to the south is a great valley
within this valley are trees not like other trees for
their leaves are red and through this valley runs
a river that sings this valley is the home of the
waupona the king of birds but also within this valley
dwell savage men men who climb like monkeys in the
trees and who kill all who enter their valley these
monkey-men worship the waupona as their god and
the waupona warns them of the approach of strangers
many of the metakis have gone forth to brave the
dangers of the valley and to secure the feathers of the
waupona but few have ever returned

    we metakis do not hold sacred the waupona as do
the monkey-men but rather prize him as a token of great
bravery and prowess for he who comes back from that
valley with the waupona plumes may become a chief of
his tribe for many years now none have sought the
prize i alone of the metakis have the feathers of the
king of birds and those i took while still a young
man 

   undoubtedly i thought the old cacique was romanc-
ing there was no question that the feathers were real
that they were highly prized and like as not the bird
was confined to some restricted area in a district in-
habited by a hostile tribe but melangas yarn of red
trees monkey-men and a singing river was i mentally
decided merely the indians love for adding imaginary
frills to a story and perhaps mixed with a little supersti-
tion at any rate i had already decided to go after the
waupona and i told melanga of my intention

   the old fellow looked really sad he declared i would
lose my life and he assured me that no indians would ac-
company me at last however he admitted that a white
man might succeed for he had a wholesome and almost
superstitious regard for my gun and he also admitted
that one of his men knew the way to the wauponas
valley having once travelled that far with the idea of
securing the coveted plumes although his courage had
failed him at the last both he and melanga agreed that

the trip was long and arduous mainly through the
forest until a large river was reached which was to be
followed for three days i suggested that a raft might
be built and the trip shortened and made easier by
floating down this stream and the metakis agreed that
this might easily be done with a party of six al-
though the idea had never occurred to them before

   it did not take long to make all preparations for the
trip but the following morning all was in readiness
and at daybreak we set out our scanty luggage on our
shoulders led by tinana our guide and two other
metakis for four days we tramped steadily through the
forest throughout that time gradually ascended towards
the interior highlands on the morning of the fifth day
we entered a thicker jungle and in the afternoon heard
the sound of running water presently we came out upon
the banks of a good sized river it was a swift flowing
stream without rapids as far as could be seen and ex-
cellent for our purpose there was abundant material
for a raft at hand and as soon as camp was made we
began preparations

   the next two days were occupied in building a raft
in doing which we used the light cork-like balsa trees
bound together with lianas and floored with bamboo
and on the third day we embarked the craft floated
high and buoyantly and sped down-stream with gratify-
ing speed for six days we floated along swiftly and
easily and on the seventh day tinana assured me that in
two days more we could go ashore and in four days we
could reach the valley of the waupona birds fortunately
we met no bad rapids and at the allotted time we ran
the raft ashore and resumed our tramp through the
forest the first day the way led across rocky ridges and
through deep canons filled with a mass of tangled vines
sawgrass thorn-trees and cactus where we had to cut a
trail as we proceeded the next day was even worse
the ascent became constantly sharper the jungles more
impenetrable while we frequently waded streams of ice
cold mountain water by nightfall we had reached an
altitude so great that we shivered with cold despite a
roaring fire in the small cavern where we camped but
the worst of the trip was over and tinana told me that
only two more days remained between us and the valley
early the next morning we crossed the highest ridge of
the mountains with several snow-capped peaks in sight
and rapidly descended the farther slope the jungle soon
replaced the scanty vegetation of the higher altitudes
the air became warmer and by night we were again in
open forest and a tropical climate

   soon after noon the next day tinana showed signs
of uneasiness and stopped now and then to peer ahead
and about searching the earth with his keen eyes and
listening intently to every sound he was evidently
nervous the metakis kept their blowguns in readiness
for instant use and i felt a tingle of excitement for i
realized we were in hostile country and nearing the
haunts of the waupona and melangas mythical monkey-
men but it was mid-afternoon when tinana crouched
low and with a gesture for silence beckoned to me
crawling to his side where he squatted behind a dense
cluster of vines i peered out through the foliage in the
direction he indicated

   at our feet the earth ended in a sheer precipice and
at its foot fully a thousand feet below and stretching
for miles into the distance was a great sunlit valley that
gleamed like a sea of blood a vast expanse of vivid
scarlet broken by the silver thread of a ribbon through
its centre and by little patches of green a marvelous
sight we had reached our goal melanga had not ex-
aggerated the wonder of this valley now that we had
reached the haunt of the waupona i was almost pre-
pared to believe in the monkey-men

chapter ii

cut or a long time i gazed fascinated at the
h great red valley and could scarcely credit
my own senses it seemed so incredible it
seemed like some weird dream or such a scene as one
might expect to see on mars at last tinana touched
my arm and suggested that we delay no longer but at-
tempt to descend to the valley right away this task
appeared impossible the spot where we stood was the
verge of a precipice obviously impassable crawling
back a few yards tinana led us by a circuitous route
until we came to the edge of a large lake surrounded by
forest the upper end of the lake was lost among the
trees but near us the lower end washed against a rocky
ledge there seemed no outlet to the lake but dim and
faint in the distance i heard the roar of falling water

   through a thick tangle tinana led the way to a
rough steep gorge and as we slipped and picked our
way along the declevity i now and then caught brief
glimpses of the red valley through the intervening foliage
constantly too the roar of the waterfall became louder
and presently as we rounded a turn in the trail i saw
the cataract before us and towering for hundreds of
feet above the valley rose a sheer rock wall and half way
up its face a great white column of water rushed out-
ward through a tunnel-like opening in the solid cliff

    straight into the air it spouted for nearly a hundred
feet to spread and fall in a great fan-shaped dazzling
mass to the valley far below it was an awe-inspiring
sight-this great scimitar of water bathed in a veil of
mist and forced with irresistible power through a fissure
in the precipice but i could not see that we were any
nearer a solution of the problem of reaching the valley
except that we were now within a few hundred feet of
the red trees instead of the thousand feet that had sep-
arated us when we had first viewed the weird spot but
we had not yet reached the end of our descent directly
under that roaring terrific mass of outflung water
tinana led on until at last he halted on a broad terrace
or ledge covered with jungle and barely one hundred feet
above the valley with its scarlet-leaved trees here
screened from possible observation from below tinana
explained that it would be necessary to make a ladder
of vines in order to desccnd no doubt a single tough
liana dropped over the cliff would have served him and
his fellows but the indians knew that it was beyond the
powers of any white man to slide down or clamber up a
trailing vine for a hundred feet and all started at work
to fashion a rude though serviceable rope ladder of the
strong lianas that everywhere draped the trees

    it was slow work and as the indians busied them-
selves i crept to the cliff edge and studied the valley i
could see no signs of human beings no huts no smoke
that bespoke inhabitants no animals appeared upon the
open swales of green among the trees and i felt con-
vinced that melanga had drawn upon his imagination
when he had spoken of the monkey-men it seemed im-
possible that any human begins had once occupied the
place and had moved away or died off since he made his
last journey to the waupona country but tinana did
not share my views he and the other metakis were
nervous frightened and insisted that some terrible
hostile beings inhabited the valley no fire was permitted
that night and despite all efforts i began to feel nerv-
ous and on a tension myself starting at every sound
sleeping badly and having nightmarish dreams but the
bright morning sun dispelled my unwonted fears and
after a careful scrutiny of the valley tinana and his
fellows cautiously dropped the frail ladder over the
verge of the cliff then half fearfully tinana com-
menced to descend he reached the valley in safety
looked up and signalled for us to follow backing over

the edge of the precipice i too went down the ladder
despite the fact that tinana had secured the lower end
the thing swayed horribly and i marvelled that he could
ever have reached the bottom with the thing hanging
loose but a hundred feet is not far and within a few
minutes we all stood together at the base of the cliff
gazing about us at the strange and bizarre trees with
their immense banner-like leaves of red they were
huge gnarled and twisted with innumerable pendent
roots like those of mangroves or banyans and their
broad-spreading crowns were so interlaced and tangled
that they formed an impenetrable roof above our heads
from above the place had seemed almost impossible a
weirdly strange and unnatural spot but now that i
stood beneath the trees i realized that after all there
was nothing so very strange or remarkable about it
the trees i saw were some species of giant croton very
similar in form and color of leaves to the ornamental
crotons grown in gardens and hence in no way more re-
markable or unnatural than those red-leaved plants

  suddenly from seemingly near at hand came an
odd musical sound a note that rose and fell like the
strumming of a guitar and apparently issuing from the
stream that flowed near the indians started drew to-
gether lifted their weapons and cast frightened glances
about but there was no sign of human beings within
sight it was the singing river of melanga and as i
realized this i laughed strange i had not thought of it
sooner it was a perfectly natural and not uncommon
phenomenon a sound produced by loose pebbles and
stones tinkling against one another as they were moved
by the current and magnified by the water i tried to
explain this to the indians but i could see that they were
convinced the music was of supernatural origin my
mestizo jos was the most nervous of all

  suddenly my words were interrupted by a harsh
metallic cry from the tree tops and instantly everyone
wheeled and stared in the direction whence the sound
came among the branches there was a flash of dazzl-
ing purple and upon a dead limb in plain view alighted
the most gorgeously beautiful bird i had ever seen in-
stantly i knew it for a trogan but a trogan three times
as large and a thousand times more vivid and wonderful
in color than even the famed resplendent trogan or
quetzal from its head a great curved crest fell forward
over its beak and down its neck while from above its
tail long graceful fern-like plumes extended for several
feet from head to tail the creature was intense purple
gleaming with hues of gold and violet as the light played
upon its plumage while from shoulder to shoulder across
the breast was a broad white band edged with crimson
it was the waupona truly the king of birds all these de-
tails i took in at a glance cautiously i cocked my gun
but before i could raise the weapon to my shoulder
tanina had placed his blowgun to his lips with a puff
of breath the tiny dart sped on its way and with flutter-
ing wings the magnificent bird came tumbling to the
earth

   eagerly i dashed forward and picked up the won-
derful creature which i knew no other white man had
ever seen as i examined the priceless specimen mentally
gloating over my good fortune the discordant scream
of another waupona issued from the tree tops and as i
wheeled about i caught a glimpse of a second purple
bird flashing away on whirring wings

   almost at the same instant there was a movement
among the scarlet leaves and some large dark body
showed through the foliage almost involuntarily i
raised my gun and blazed away at the report the
branches bent and thrashed about and a huge black
ape-like creature came hurtling crashing to the ground
instantly pandemonium broke loose above our heads and
screams cries and yells resounded from the tree-tops
the king of the monkey men



while the branches swayed and trembled as unseen in-
visible beings leaped and rushed among them swift
across my mind came remembrance of melangas
words-his tale of monkey-men who lived in the trees
he had been right after all whatever the things-
whether human beings or apes we were surrounded by
them and yet i was not terror-stricken we were
armed superior beings and that any ape-like creatures
would dare attack us after seeing and hearing the ef-
fects of my gun never entered my head then as we
hesitated not knowing which way to turn a dart
whizzed by my face and struck quivering in the arm of
the metaki beside me i gasped the things were hu-
man they used blowguns now i was terrified with
a quick motion and a sharp cry of anger and despair the
indian plucked the tiny arrow from his flesh and raised
his blowgun to his lips glancing upward i saw a black
demoniacal face glaring at us from between the branches
it was but a momentary glimpse but the brief instant
of its appearance was enough for the metaki his mes-
senger of death sped unerringly and found its mark and
as the sinister horrible face drew back among the
branches i saw the little shaft of palm stem imbedded
in a black cheek while a fierce cry of terror issued from
the swollen lips as the blow-gun dropped from the
hands of the stricken metaki a huge black form tumbled
from the branches hung for a moment by one limb and
then plunged to earth just as the indian with a last con-
vulsive gasp slumped like an empty bag to the ground
before me

   terror now gripped all of us and spurred us to
mad flight we dashed from the red forest we were
close to its verge not a hundred yards separated us
from an open green vale with the river just beyond i
ran as i had never run before heading blindly towards
the cliff and the rope ladder intent only on escaping
from those terrible savages in the tree tops once i
heard a faint cry and glancing back i saw tinana
rolling over and over at the forests edge another
metaki lay stretched lifeless within a few feet of him
while ahead of me racing towards the cliff were ppe
and jos they had been the first to take flight and
already they were close to the ladder and safety
the next moment they reached it and madly insane
with fear the two struggled and fought for first place
then fairly leaping they started up while the
frail affair swung and rocked to their frantic
efforts in vain i shouted they paid no atten-
tion to me i had almost reached the cliff and the two
were now half way up its face i was spent winded but
safety was at hand suddenly from above came a cry
of mortal terror there was a rending snapping sound
and horrified i stopped in my tracks and gazed fascin-
ated the combined weight the mad struggles of the
two men had been too much the lianas had parted and
clinging desperately to the remaining strands the two
hung screaming mid-way up the cliff with certain death
staring them in the face their agonized cries were
terrible but their awful suspense lasted but a moment
with a last tearing sound the lianas gave way and the

two men plunged to their death upon the jagged rocks
below i was alone alone in this awful valley that
swarmed with half-human monstrous foes alone with
all hope of escape cut off but i would die fighting if die

escape might be able to stand off the creatures who i
noticed had not left the shelter of the forest to pursue
us

   it was my only hope and turning i dashed across
the smooth green glade spurred on by the unearthly cries
of rage from the red forest in my rear a moment later
and the river was before me and without a seconds
hesitation i plunged headlong into the stream

  scarcely had the water closed upon me when i real-
ized my efforts had been in vain i had expected to find
a shoal stream through which i could wallow or swim
to the opposite shore instead i sank into a deep
swirling eddying current that swept me irresistibly
along sucking me under the surface and spinning me
about like a bit of chaff i dropped my gun which up to
then i had retained and wildly struck out in an effort
to reach the surface and fill my bursting lungs with air
at last my face broke through the water into the air and
i gasped a half-breath before the whirlpools again drew
me under i felt that all was over that i was doomed to
death in the river but even that was preferable to the
poisoned darts of the savages then just as i was losing
consciousness i felt my feet touch bottom i kicked and
thrashed convulsively and struggling from the stream
dropped senseless upon a sand bar

   how long i lay there dead to the world i will never
know slowly i became aware of the sounds of voices
apparently far away strange gutteral discordant they
sounded and instantly memory returned filled with
stark terror i sat up as i did so a cry of horror burst
from my lips crouching within a few feet of me his
repulsive ugly black face peering into mine was one
of the monstrous ape-like beings with all my exhausted
strength i struck madly at the face a loud shout followed
the resounding whack with which my hand struck the
savage features and for the first time i was aware that
i was completely surrounded by fully two dozen of the
strangest beings any man has ever seen

  there was no doubt that they were human but
they were the most repulsively hideous men that the
wildest fancy could conceive black as coal with bowed
legs and enormous ape-like feet stooping shoulders and
long gorilla arms they appeared like a troop of calibans
their faces were broad flat and brutal with high cheek
bones enormously developed jaws small turned-up noses
and little restless roving eyes like those of an elephant
their chins were covered with thick matted beards and
a mop of tangled hair overhung their foreheads and ex-
tended down their necks and shoulders in a sort of mane
despite their hideousness there was a certain expres-
sion of intelligence in their faces and eyes and their
high foreheads bespoke a large brain capacity very dif-
ferent from what one would expect in such low primitive
types of man every one too was a giant with great
corded rippling muscles under his black skin mostly
they were nude but a few wore strips of bark about
their loins and one or two had spindles of wood or bone
through their ears and noses and nearly every one
grasped a short blowgun scarcely three feet in length
and i sat there trembling with fear and exhaustion on
the gravel bar awaiting the death that i felt sure would
be meted out to me

  and yet somehow there appeared to be nothing
antagonistic or hostile in their attitudes or expressions
the fellow i had struck had drawn out of reach but
showed no resentment instead all were regarding me
with intense curiosity and were conversing in low gut-
teral tones among themselves

   then it dawned upon me that i was undoubtedly as
strange and amazing a being to them as they were to me
they had never seen a white man had never seen cloth-
ing and altogether i was a very different sort of being
from the indians whom they had killed

   slowly with a great effort i struggled to my feet i
was weak and reeled instantly two of the terrible crea-
tures sprang forward and not ungently supported me and
half-carried me across the bar to the shore i recoiled
at their touch but was far too weak to resist then as
i sank upon the soft turf the things gathered about
clucking gesticulating jabbering and now and again
very gingerly reaching out and with half fearful fingers
touching my garments peeking up my sleeves rubbing
their hands across my boots and obviously filled with
wonder presently a newcomer arrived carrying my
hat and the gutteral words rose high in excitement
evidently the fellows knew the hat belonged to me for
they held it towards me and when i placed it on my
head they leaped away as if i had performed some awe-
inspiring feat of magic

   i began to feel somewhat reassured perhaps after
all i would not be killed out of hand-i was too valuable
a curiosity to be wasted and even if i were kept a pris-
oner there was a chance that i might eventually escape
but i had little time to speculate on my ultimate fate
one of the creatures who seemed to be in charge of the
party approached me and by gestures and signs in-
dicated that i was to follow him i had now regained a
good bit of my strength and surrounded by the beings
i followed the leader towards the forest as we reached
the first trees one of the creatures sprang into the
branches with the agility of a monkey running up the
hanging roots and swinging from limb to limb with his
blowgun grasped in his teeth to run off through the
tree tops like a gigantic ape one after another followed
him while several squatted among the branches and
peered down at the others and myself as if expecting me
to climb up indeed their leader urged me on and
presently losing his temper jabbered at me in anything
but friendly tones even at my best i could not have
ascended the trees but my captors had very different
ideas on the subject forgetting their fears they pushed
me against the tree trunk and even tried to boost me up
feeling that i should humor them i tried my best to
climb the smooth slippery trunk and my useless efforts
brought chuckles of amusement from the savages as i
slipped back the monkey-men examined my hoes
gabbled volubly and called to their companions in the
tree-tops although their lingo was unintelligible their
tones were so expressive that i felt sure they were ex-
plaining that my feet were minus toes and hence not
adapted for climbing but they had made up their minds
that regardless of all obstacles or defects their captive
was going aloft

   before i fully realized what they were doing one of
the giants had seized me and lifted me above his head
as easily as though i had been a child the next second
one of the fellows above reached down grasped me by
the waist heaved me up like a sack of meal and actually
tossed me like a ball to another savage still higher up
too astounded and frightened to cry out and breathless
from my rough handling i merely gasped as i was tossed
about like a handball a moment later one of the crea-
tures sprang forward seized me in his arms and leaped
off among the branches carrying me with no apparent
effort

   never had any other mortal such a ride the being
travelled with the speed and agility of a squirrel he
leaped from branch to branch sometimes catching by his
free hand and his feet sometimes grasping a branch
with one hand and swinging forward for a dozen feet or
so to a neighboring tree and again running upright
along some projecting limb and leaping off through space
or through foliage but invariably landing as softly as
easily as a bird never missing a foothold or colliding
with a branch or twig at first i was terrified nauseated
and i felt dizzy and in constant fear of being dropped
the king of the monkey men



or tom from my captors grasp by some branch but
presently i began to enjoy the strange sensation the
gigantic being traveled as surely and easily as though
he bore no burden and i was not even scratched by the
limbs or branches as he raced along mile after mile
i was carried in this strange way shifted from one
creature to another from time to time until at last the
monkey-men slackened their mad pace and broke the
silence they had maintained up till then their cries
were answered from ahead and a moment later the
tree-tops vanished and i felt my carrier spring from an
outflung branch for what seemed an endless time we
sailed through space until with a soft thud of his thick-
soled feet my captor landed on some solid material and
released his grasp of my body

   dazed i gazed about to find myself on a narrow
shelf of rock with a precipice above and below before
me the red-leaved forest stretched into the distance
and a little above the ledge where i sat a great tree
spread its branches towards me even as i tried to col-
lect my senses several of the monkey-men ran out upon
a branch of this tree leaped into the air and like gigan-
tic flying-squirrels sailed through the intervening space
and landed lightly upon the rock beside me it was
more than marvelous it was actually incredible that
any human being could be so sure-footed so agile as to
accomplish this feat

  yet i had actually witnessed it i knew that i
myself had reached the shelf of rock by the same method
borne through twenty feet of air in the grasp of one
of the creatures glancing down at the perpendicular
wall with the jagged debris fully one hundred feet be-
low i drew back shuddering at thought of what might
have happened had my captor missed his footing mis-
calculated his distance or released his grip of his human
freight then i noticed that the number of beings on
the ledge had greatly increased there were not more
than twenty who had come through the trees yet now
the ledge was fairly crowded with the strange creatures
all were chattering excitedly and it was evident that
those who had brought me were telling their friends of
the trip presently there was a chorus of loud cries
and a monkey-man leaped from the tree to the ledge
he was i saw carrying the dead waupona bird and
at sight of it every monkey-man bowed his forehead to
the rock and uttered low moaning sounds

  then they arose and listened while the newcomer
apparently told of the birds death and as i judged
from his tones and gestures related how i had brought
down one of the creatures with my gun the expres-
sions of wonder and fear that filled their faces as they
listened convinced me that with my gun i could always
have cowed the beings and been safe but my weapon
was irretrievably lost at the bottom of the river even
the few matches in my pockets were wet and useless for
performing impressive miracles i did not have a single
article which could be used for the purpose my sole
possessions were my pipe and some tobacco my note-
book and pencil a pocket knife and handkerchief and a
handful of now useless cartridges somewhere my watch
had been lost-probably in my mad flight from the forest
-and i never carried a compass flint steel and tinder
or the various other articles which story tellers are so
fond of utilizing in their tales when the hero desires
to work seeming miracles to impress savages

   i had little time for such thoughts however the
leader of the crowd was signalling me to follow him
and with no choice in the matter i trudged along the
ledge the path ascended rapidly rounded an angle
on the mountain side and turning abruptly entered a
narrow fissure in the face of the cliff

   the sudden transition from bright sunshine to al-
most stygian darkness blinded me temporarily and i

proceeded for fully one hundred feet through the tunnel-
like passage before i was able to distinguish my sur-
roundings then ahead i caught a glimmer of ruddy
light and a moment later we emerged in an immense
lofty chamber a huge cavern formed by nature ita
vaulted roof hung with stalactites among which was
an aperture which admitted daylight and illuminated
the cave with a faint radiance

   in the centre of the rock floor a large fire burned
brightly casting a lurid glare upon the walls which
glistened with minute crystals that gleamed and scin-
tillated like myriads of gems everywhere in the walls
i could see the yawning black entrances to smaller caves
or passages while squatted around the walls seated by
the fire and peering from the holes were scores of the
monkey-men with their women and children all this i
saw as we crossed the few yards of space between the
passageway and the fire

   then my captors halted and threw themselves upon
the floor and uttered wailing cries before us seated
upon a rude bench formed by knocking a cluster of
btalagmites to pieces was an enormous monkey-man
his tangled beard fell to his bulging middle his stiff
hair stood out about his sinister face like a lions mane
and on his head was a crown of the purple plumes of
the waupona bird instantly i recognized him as the
king of the monkey-men and equally instantly i took
a violent and deep-seated dislike for the savage glower-
ing old potentate

   he was by far the ugliest being i had ever seen
the most hideous of his subjects was a beauty by com-
parison and his expression was indescribably cruel
bestial and crafty yet despite his ugliness and re-
pulsiveness his matted filthy hair and beard and his
black fat body there was something regal in his ap-
pearance as with a frown on his forehead and his red-
dened eyes gleaming he surveyed me with a haughty
contemptuous stare

   and i could not help admiring his self-control al-
though i felt sure that he was consumed with curiosity
at my appearance yet he gave no sign of wonder or sur-
prise he merely stared at me with his wicked eyes
though his gaze was most disconcerting and malignant
i managed to stare back without flinching this evi-
dently was not at all pleasing to his majesty and i
could see that his ill temper was rising doubtless he
was accustomed to having all bow before him and he
had no liking for a being who looked him boldly in the
eye and failed to kow-tow to his regal presence he
seemed about to speak but the next second the fellow
with the dead waupona came cringingly to the throne
and reverently placed the dead bird on the floor beside
the king instantly the monarch flew into a towering
rage his mane and hair fairly bristled his eyes blazed
and he roared out a tirade of words pointing first at me
and then at the bird and in his excitement rising from
his throne and crouching like a jaguar ready to spring
obviously he possessed a most violent temper and a
nasty disposition and i had a hunch that we would not
get on at all well together it was equally clear that
the killing of the waupona was an unpardonable offense
and a terrible crime and that the king held me account-
able for it but as the fellow who had brought the bird
strove to explain and with graphic gestures showed how
the creature had been killed by a blowgun in an indians
hands the royal temper cooled a bit and the king listened
intently i had expected that i would be brought to
trial for shooting the monkey-man whom we had first
seen but he had apparently been quite forgotten in the
greater offense of destroying the sacred bird as far
as i could judge no reference was made to him but i
soon found i was mistaken the fellow was now telling
the king of my part in the affairs of the day his

actions were unmistakable and his imitation of the re-
port of my gun while it would have been ludicrous at
another time was realistic enough for me evidently
however this was a bit too miraculous a yarn for the
king to swallow he had to be shown uttering a sharp
command he pointed to the dead bird and then at me
one of the men lifted the dead bird tenderly and carry-
ing it across the cave placed it upon a jutting point of
rock then to my amazement they indicated by signs
and gestures that i was to repeat my miracle of the
gun and bring down the dead waupona from its rest-
ing place i was helpless absolutely at a loss the
monkey-men had quite overlooked the fact that the chief
accessory my gun was missing if indeed they had ever
seen it there i stood racking my brains for some
escape from my dilemma while as proof of the earnest-
ness of the kings intentions two of the beings held
blowguns to their lips and pointed at my body if i
failed to obey the kings orders i was as good as dead
in all probability i thought my life would be forfeited
anyway then suddenly an inspiration came to me
my hands nervously fumbling in my pockets had come
in contact with my cartridges holding one of these
hidden in my left hand i stepped nearer the fire and
dramatically raising my right arm i pointed at the dead
bird and gave a sharp cry at the same instant tossing
the shell into the lames instantly all faces were turned
towards the waupona bird all eyes were rivetted on
the creature or on my outstretched arm there was a
tense moment of suspense and then with a deafening
report the coals and firebrands flew into the air there
was a puff of dense white smoke and the roar of the
exploding shell reverberated through the cavern with the
noise of thunder

   not a monkey-man ever saw what happened to the
waupona bird a mighty cry of abject terror arose
from the crowd of savages and as the smoke cleared
away i looked about to find every occupant of the cave
even the king himself prone on the floor while a weird
moaning chant-like wail arose from the awe-struck
beings i glanced towards the waupona bird and could
scarcely believe my eyes it had completely vanished
whether the jar of the explosion had knocked it from
the rock and it had dropped into some fissure or what
had become of it i never knew but luck or fate had
played into my hands

   the king was the first to recover and cautiously
raising his head he looked about as he too saw that
the bird had disappeared he kow-towed again wailing
louder than any of his subjects then he again glanced
fearfully about and seeing me standing unhurt and
erect among his prostrate tribesmen he fairly grovelled
on the floor my trick had more than fulfilled all my
hopes and it was fully ten minutes before the monkey-
men and their ruler regained enough confidence to raise
their heads then since nothing more happened the
king rose tremblingly to his feet and seated himself a
bit shakingly on his throne one by one his subjects
also rose but the kings expression had completely al-
tered his savage glare had given place to a look of
awe and there was no hint of anger or enmity in his
tones when he spoke again for the time being at least
i felt i was safe and as i still had nearly a dozen cart-
ridges in my pocket i felt sure that as long as a fire
was available i could keep both king and subjects in
mortal fear of my powers

   the fellow who had brought the waupona was now
bowing before me and signing for me to follow him as
i stepped forward he rose and passing the fire-at
which he shied a bit-he led the way across the cave
towards one of the openings in the opposite wall

   for some distance we passed along a narrow tun-
nel until my guide turned to one side and i found my-

self in a fairly large cavern with a rude couch of palm
leaves on one side and a smouldering fire in the centre
the whole dimly lit by a crevice high in the wall evi-
dently this was my quarters or my prison and with a
final obeisance the monkey-man withdrew

   i threw myself upon the pile of leaves utterly tired
and spent whatever might be in store for me could
be met as it occurred for the present rest and sleep
meant far more to me than the future i mentally
thanked god that i had the cartridges and my last con-
scious thought was that i only wished they were sticks
of dynamite

chapter iii

 had no means of knowing how long i slept
i but as no glimmer of light showed on the walls
i felt sure it was still night i felt much re-
freshed but terribly hungry and thirsty and i won-
dered if my captors intended to let me die of thirst or
starvation then as i glanced about i saw by the light
of the smouldering fire a calabash of water on the floor
i drained this and again slept i was aroused by some-
one moving about and opened my eyes to see the giant
fellow who had led me to my cave he was fanning the
fire into a blaze and beside him was a plantain leaf on
which were several strange fruits and a piece of meat
evidently he was about to serve my breakfast and all
fears of being starved were cast aside

   when the fellow heard me move he turned
grinned amiably and bobbed his head reassuringly
despite his ugliness he seemed a rather good-natured
brute and the fact that he had brought food rather won
my liking for him but i was handicapped and pre-
vented from making any friendly overtures because i
could not understand a word he said nor could i make
him understand a word of any dialect i knew however
we managed to get along on sign language and he soon
served the half-cooked meat meanwhile grimacing and
kow-towing twisting his broad black face into ludicrous
grins and reminding me of an overgrown puppy trying
to make friends with a stranger while i ate he
squatted before me gazing fixedly up at me with an ex-
pression of such wonder and curiosity in his little eyes
that i could not help laughing he looked for all the
world like some country lad watching the animals fed
at a managerie apparently my laughter delighted him
and he was quite happy to think that such a remarkable
being as myself should take any notice of him the
most important thing it seemed to me was to try to
learn a smattering of his dialect pointing to a fruit
i said fruit for a space he looked puzzled then
he caught the idea grinned delightedly and muttered
poot then reaching out his paw he touched the
fruit with his finger and said imtah

   there was nothing stupid about him and once he
had grasped the idea of learning my language and teach-
ing me his we got along famously he leaped about
pointing to one object after another pronouncing or
rather trying to pronounce the english names as i
uttered them and very carefully enunciating the equiv-
alents in his own lingo before i had finished my light
meal i had learned the names of fruit rock fire water
meat calabash feet hands and a number of other things
but i realized it would be far slower work acquiring a
knowledge of verbs adjectives and grammar however
there was no time like the present and rather doubtful
as t whether his intellect would carry him far enough to
understand what i desired i rose and leaped up and
down repeating the word jump instantly the fellow
imitated my actions and cried ik ik he even went
farther and leaping clear across the floor shouted
ikarak and after a short hop exclaimed taik i was
the king of the monkey men



more than pleased at the beings intelligence and i
knew that i could find my time fully occupied in learn-
ing the monkey-mens jargon my next attempt was to
learn his name it was some time before i could make
my meaning clear on this point but at last striking
his breast he said proudly mumbai repeating the word
several times

   all right mumba i laughed and striking my own
breast repeated my name henry that was quite be-
yond the powers of his vocal cords however and a gut-
teral geny was the best he could do at last mumba
gathered up the remains of breakfast and went hopping
away down the passage and i gave myself up to think-
ing over my predicament and my future i felt sure
that i was a prisoner i knew it was out of the ques-
tion to attempt any escape to be sure no one was on
guard as far as i could see and when i peered into the
passageway not a living being was in sight to reach
the open air however i would be forced to pass through
the main cavern with its hordes of occupants and even
if i did succeed in stealing out unnoticed how was i to
gain the valley let alone escape from it for you will
remember that i had been brought to the ledge of rock
by air line in the grasp of a monkey-man

   but i was curious to know just how much of a cap-
tive i was also i had no desire to remain cooped up in
my cavern if i was free to go elsewhere quite boldly
therefore i left the room and wandered down the pass-
age towards the main cave without hindrance i gained

mile after mile i was cnrricd in this
strange way shiftod from one creaturc
to another from time to time

open air for presently i saw light ahead and a moment
later came out upon the rock shelf above the scarlet
valley no one was in sight on the ledge and i began
to wonder if i was a prisoner after all

   as far as i could see i was free to walk away-
provided i could reach the earth below yet i was as
securely imprisoned as though i were behind bolts and
bars the pleasure of being in the air and sunshine
again was sufficient for the time being and seating my-
self upon a rock i scrutinized the valley trying to
locate the spot where i had entered it and had first met
the monkey-men

   there was little difficulty in finding the place
about two miles away the silvery flash of the column
of water could be seen and from there i could follow

the rivers course to the spot where tinana had killed
the waupona

 still following the course of the stream with my
eyes i was surprised to find that it apparently ended in
a second towering cliff at the further end of the valley
while on the side opposite to where i sat a rock wall
rose sheer for fully a thousand feet

the valley was completely surrounded by insur-
mountable barriers and its inhabitants were effectually
cut off from the rest of the world no wonder i thought
that they had remained so primitive so distinct from
all other races and had developed such unique character-
istics for all i knew the beings might have been
isolated here since their ancestors evolved from apes
but my speculations on such matters soon gave way to
more practical things i noted that the ledge descended
towards the valley becoming narrower and narrower
and forming a mere trail or fissure in its course as i
studied it i became certain that it would be possible
to follow along it to the earth far beneath me i de-
termined to try it it was a precarious pathway and
i picked my way cautiously and gingerly several times
i found small gulleys or fissures which seemed to lead
to the valley but each turned out to be a blind lead or
were too steep for human feet to descend still keeping
to the main ledge i continued downwards until at last

the throne-room as i might call it a few women and
children and one or two men were there and at my ap-
pearance the adults threw themselves on the floor while
the youngsters scuttled like frightened rats into their
black holes i was received more like a god than a
prisoner and no one made any attempt to interfere with
my movements unfortunately i had not the least idea
from which of the holes i had entered the cavern but
one was as good as another and i remembered i had
faced the fire with the kings throne at my right when
i had arrived i chose the largest opening on that side
and walked cautiously along the dark tunnel either
luck was with me or else several entrances led to the

i came to a spot where i could go no farther then for
the first time i noticed something which had escaped
me before the tree from which the monkey-men had
leaped to the ledge was several feet higher than the
spot on which they had landed they might leap from
the tree to the ledge but even the ape-like beings could
not i felt certain leap up and across twenty feet of
space there must be another means of reaching the
valley and as i realized this i heard voices from be-
neath me very cautiously i peered over the cliff
almost directly beneath the spot where i stood a
monkey-woman was moving about picking up fruits
from beneath a low tree

   as i watched her she half turned towards the cliff
and uttered a shout as if calling to someone in answer
there was a low cry and the next instant a monkey-man
issued from a fissure in the rock scrambled down a
few yards of broken stone and joined the woman after
him followed another and another until half a dozen of
the beings stood under the tree as i watched them
they wrapped the fruits in leaves secured the bundles
with vines and began clamboring up the rock-strewn
slope to vanish at last in the fissure my suspicions
were confirmed there was another exit and i determined
to find it my plan was simple no doubt i thought
the fruits would be carried to the main cabin and pro-
vided i could reach there first i could see by which
passage the fruit-gatherers entered hurrying back up
the ledge as rapidly as possible i reached the tunnel
dashed along this and emerged in the main cave just
in time two men were crossing the floor carrying leaf-
wrapped burdens and a moment later a woman and
several men appeared from a small opening in the wall
there was no doubt about the exit but the cave was
well filled with people and i hesitated about attempting
to make my way out better leave it until tomorrow
when there are few about i decided however i was
afraid that i might forget whicii hole led to the valley
and the idea of making a rough sketch of the cavern
with the location of the various openings occurred to
me seating myself on a fallen piece of stalactite i
drew out my note-book and pencil and began to draw a
rough plan of the cave at first the savages cast fright-
ened sidelong glances at me as if fearing i was about
to produce some magic but as nothing happened they
regained confidence and drawn by the savages insati-
able curiosity came closer and closer to me having
completed my hurried sketch of the cavern i com-
menced sketching the men and women and had just
completed a drawing of a woman roasting a piece of
meat over the fire when one of the men glanced over
my shoulder and caught sight of what i was doing in-
stantly he uttered a shrill cry leaped back and poured
out a perfect torrent of excited words everyone rushed
to him and jabbering and gesticulating they crowded
about me craning their necks peering at the page of
my book all were tremendously excited i had worked
another miracle

   tearing out the leaf with the drawing i handed
it to the nearest monkey-man never had artist a more
appreciative or enthusiastic audience and the cries of
admiration and wonder mingled with roars of laughter
as the paper was passed from hand to hand the noise
evidently attracted the attention of those in the nearby
caves for men and women appeared from every side and
from each dark hole in the cavern walls then in the
midst of the hubbub i glanced up to see the king him-
self approaching so thoroughly engrossed were the
people that they gave no heed to their monarch they
did not even bother to kow-tow before him for an
instant he glowered as if about to pronounce dire
punishment on all and then as one of the men handed
him the sketch his expression underwent a most remark-

able change and incredulity and amazement spread over
his hideous face

    for a time he studied it intently and then approach-
ing me he made it quite clear by signs that he wished
me to make a picture of himself

   quite willingly and smiling at the thought of at-
tempting to reproduce his ugliness adequately i com-
menced sketching while an awed silence fell upon the
assembled throng no doubt it was a very inferior like-
ness and of no artistic merit for i lay no claims to being
a portrait artist still if not flattering it was unmis-
takably the king-long beard bristling hair feather
crown and all as i completed the rapid sketch i tore
the page from my note book and handed it to the mon-
arch the expression upon his face when he saw the
likeness was so ludicrous that i shook with laughter
despite my efforts to control my amusement

   the king examined the sketch carefully lifted his
hand and touched his crown felt his hair stroked his
beard and seemed mightily puzzled to find them all in
their proper places for a moment he thought that they
had been transferred bodily to the paper then he turned
the sheet over looked on the blank side and utterly un-
able to solve the mystery his grim awed features broke
into a smile of self-satisfaction he ran to his throne
and placed the paper upright on the seat then squat-
ting before it he gave himself up to admiring his own
portrait it was the first time he had ever seen himself
as others saw him

   that i had risen tremendously in the estimation
of the monkey-men was evident for my ability as an
artist apparently seemed fully as wonderful and super-
natural to these beings as the exploding cartridge had
been though it lacked its terrifying qualities so from
being feared and regarded with a rather awed respect
i found i had been transformed to a popular idol my
popularity however had its drawbacks for wherever
i went the monkey-people crowded at my heels and fol-
lowed me about like a throng of small boys in the wake
of a famous baseball player i was convinced how-
ever that i had no further cause to fear death or ill
treatment for as long as i could perform such miracu-
lous feats and could please the crusty old king or could
impress him and his subjects by transferring their like-
nesses to paper i was perfectly safe i felt very much
as mark twains yankee hero must have felt at king
arthurs court except that the king of the monkey-men
was several thousand years behind king arthur

   i was amazed to find how exceedingly primitive these
beings were because the fact that they used blowguns
had at first conveyed the idea that they were not much
behind other south american tribes but i had seen
no signs of stone implements no pottery not a weapon
of any sort-not even bows and arrows-and the people
had not learned to trace even the crudest of pictures
with a burnt stick here were men and women who
were practically in the same condition as the ape-like
ancestors of man who dwelt in the rude caves of europe
countless ages ago had i been among them of my
own free will and had i been free to leave when i de-
sired i would have welcomed my opportunity to study
mankind in the making as it were but all my thoughts
were centered upon getting away from that red valley
so i hadnt the least ethnological interest in my hosts
but it was evident that i was quite free to wander
about wherever i saw fit i entered the various tun-
nels and explored them visited innumerable rooms or
smaller caves and passages and i discovered that the
entire mountain was fairly honeycombed with caverns
which provided chambers passages and residences for
this strange cave-dwelling race every room was in-
habited and i estimated that there must be fully one
thousand of the monkey-people dwelling there their life
the king of the monkey men



was of the simplest sort the furnishings of their rooms
consisted of piles of palm leaves fires which were never
permitted to die out calabashes for utensils rough
river-worn cobbles and pieces of broken stone for pound-
ers and knives for a time i was puzzled to know how
these people kindled their fires but the riddle was solved
when i found one woman using a spindle of wood which
she twirled in her hands against a bit of dry and semi-
rotten wood to me the strangest thing was the fact
that while these people had discovered the blowgun they
had not learned to make bows and arrows i decided
that in all probability the former was discovered by
accident for the monkey-men seemed far too stupid to
have actually invented or reasoned out anything and
since bows and arrows were not needed they had never
hit upon them however i mentally decided that i
would amuse myself and kill no little time by teaching
the fellows to use bows and i foresaw a lot of fun and
the passing of dreary times in educating the savages
along various lines

   as i thought of this and walked idly about i en-
tered a room where a man was skinning and cutting up
a cavy by means of a jaggard sliver of stone which served
more after the fashion of a dull saw than a knife for a
time i watched wondering what he would say if i showed
him my pocket knife and i was on the point of taking it
from my pocket when i thought better of it unques-
tionably the fellow would be terribly impressed but also
unquestionably the king would be told of it and would
demand the knife for his own use i had no intention of
losing the sole edged tool i possessed but the sight of
the savage laboring with his bit of stone gave me an-
other idea i desired to show the monkey-men how to
make really decent stone implements the only trouble
was of course that i had never made any myself but i
had a vague idea of how they were formed i had seen
indians make arrow heads by both the chipping and
fire flaking methods and i decided to try my hand at
this primitive art

   moreover my idea of showing the people bows and
arrows had made me realize suddenly that i might need
such weapons myself if i ever got away from the valley
and a knowledge of making stone arrow heads would
serve my own purposes as well

   also the sight of the fellow dressing his game had
reminded me that i was hungry and wondering a bit if
i would be provided with food or would be expected to
forage for myself i retraced my way to the main cave
and thence to my own cave there was no food there
but in a few moments mumba appeared with a meal of
fruit some roasted roots and a piece of scorched half-
raw meat

   he was in high spirits and chatted and gesticulated
excitedly but it was some time before i grasped the
fact that he was trying to tell me what he had heard of
my drawing come to think of it i had not seen him
in the crowd and i realized that the fellow felt a bit
slighted at not having seen his master working miracles
anxious to make him a firm friend and alley i drew out
my note book and sketched the big chap as he squatted
before me he fairly danced with delight when i handed
him the paper with the drawing and he fawned upon me
like a grateful puppy to him of course the sketch
was wealth untold and to receive such a gift from the
superior being whom he served was an honor equal to
that bestowed upon the king he could scarcely wait for
me to finish my meal before scampering off to exhibit
his prize to his fellows and if the mind of a monkey-
man could hold such a thing as gratitude i felt sure that
mumba would now be my firm friend for life

  presently he came running back and by gestures
made me understand that i was to follow him wonder-

  ing what was up i obeyed and as i had surmised i
found i had been summoned by his majesty who was
seated on his throne surrounded by a crowd of men and
women it was soon clear that the king desired me to
repeat my drawing exhibition and for the next hour or
more i was kept busy sketching monkey-people birds
animals insects trees and anything and everything that
came to my mind each time a sketch was finished it was
handed first to the king and then passed around their
wonder increased as they studied each new and familiar
thing depicted until they were almost ready to worship
me but i soon realized that this sort of entertainment
could not go  indefinitely my supply of paper was
getting perilously low and would soon be exhausted and
i knew that once i had used the last sheet and failed to
produce the pictures my status would be at an end and
in all probability i would be at an end also so closing
my note book i slipped it within my pocket and started
to leave the cavern this did not at all suit the king he
wanted to be entertained and in peremptory tones he
made it quite clear that i was to continue drawing i was
in a serious position if i obeyed the monarch would
realize that i felt i was in his power and would no doubt
insist on frequent and prolonged drawing exhibitions
moreover if i showed fear of his majesty i would lose
my prestige in the eyes of the people perhaps with dire
results on the other hand if i defied the king his
anger might be aroused and without stopping to consider
the consequences he or his people might fall upon me
and destroy me at once

    all this flashed through my mind in a moment as i
 hesitated then i decided upon a piece of bluff to estab-
 lish my status-quo forever stepping towards the fire
 i drew myself up faced the king and slowly raising my
 arm pointed towards the spot where the waupona had
 been placed instantly a wild howl of fear rose from
 the assembled throng many threw themselves face down
 on the floor and the king leaping from his throne cried
 out in alarm and by gestures and tones besought me not
 to produce a second explosion in the fire

   i had won my point the monkey-men had no de-
 sire for another demonstration of my terrifying magic
 ard without hindrance i left the cavern and reached my
 own room i was quite tired and throwing myself upon
 my pile of palm leaves i did not awaken until mumba
 arrived with my evening meal i slept well that night
 and after a good breakfast and another lesson in the
 monkey-man tongue with mumba i started out de-
 termined to explore the passage to the valley

    few people were in the main cavern and those
 greeted me in rather friendly fashion i crossed the huge
 room without trouble and entered the dark tunnel whence
 i had seen the people come with their loads of fruit from
 the valley

    it was narrow and inky black and in many places
 sloped steeply down but there were no side passages to
 confuse me at last i saw light ahead and in a mo-
 ment more looked from the outlet of the passageway
 across the sunlit valley before me was a steep pile of
 broken debris that sloped for fifty feet or more to the
 brush below and scrambling down this i stood at the
 base of the lofty cliff and under the nearest of the scarlet
 trees elated at being out of the caves and in the open
 once more and feeling sure i was not a prisoner under
 restraint i stepped forward to explore the valley

    but before i had gone a dozen yards there was a
 rustle in the foliage above me and glancing up i saw a
 black face peering at me the next moment a huge
 monkey-man dropped to the ground before me barring
 my way and signed that i was to go no farther anxious
 to see if he was determined to stop me i turned and
 started in another direction but instantly the savage
 -again halted me it was no use i was a prisoner afty

all and would not be permitted to wander more than a
dozen yards from the tunnel opening

   discouraged i turned back and i noticed that the
brute appeared satisfied and once more leaped into the
tree to resume his vigil but even the restricted liberty
allowed me was most welcome throwing myself upon
the grass under the trees i gave myself up to enjoyment
of the fresh air and soft breeze listening to the chirping
of insects and the rotes of birds and striving to be as
cheerful and contented as i could under the circum-
stances i had only been in the valley two days yet it
seemed like weeks or months and i realized that it be-
hooved me to keep some sort of record of time

   i could of course have written down each day in my
note book but the paper was far too valuable for sketch-
ing to permit me to do that and i busied my brain in an
endeavor to think out some sort of calendar that would
serve my purpose at last i decided upon knotted strings
each day i could tie a knot in a bit of fibre and at the
end of seven days tie a knot twice the size of the others
then as long as i remembered that i had arrived on
wednesday the sixteenth i could keep track of time
without trouble having started my tally with a strip
of flexible bark fibre by tying two knots in it i decided
to hunt for stone suitable for experimenting at arrow-
head making

  searching among the fallen rocks soon convinced
me that the material was not to be found there as it was
mainly soft limestone or in some places a granitic rock
a little to one side however i found some pieces of a
jasper-like material which i judged would serve my
purpose and with these in my pocket i started back for
my quarters anxious to keep mind and hands busy
selecting a good sized piece of the rock i placed it in
the fire turning it over and over with a stick until it was
evenly heated then raking the rock from the coals i
dipped a stick in my calabash of water and carefully let
a drop fall upon one edge of the hot stone instantly
there was a sharp click and a tiny flake of stone flew off
drop after drop was placed along the edges of the rock
and as each touched the hot surface and flakes snapped
off the pebble began to assume definite form over and
over again i heated the stone and dropped water upon
it until at last i had the intense satisfaction of having
fashioned a crude trowel-shaped object which might have
served as a spear-head the edges however were irreg-
ular and dull but this was soon remedied by flaking first
from one side and then the other until a keen cutting
edge resulted and then when i was congratulating my-
self upon my success a drop of water fell too far from
the edge and with a sharp snap the stone broke squarely
in two it was a depressing accident then suddenly i
broke into laughter to think how seriously i had taken
the whole matter had my life depended upon it i could
not have lost myself more completely in the task

   practice however made me almost perfect in this
art my second attempt was a great improvement over
my first my third was even better and by the time i
had made a dozen i felt that i was an accomplished mas-
ter of arrowhead making to be sure no self respecting
indian of the stone age would have regarded the rough
irregular things i had made as worthy of the name of
either weapons or tools but they were far superior to
anything possessed by the monkey-men and i had no
need to feel ashamed of my prehistoric art i was still
admiring my handiwork when mumba arrived with my
evening meal

   curious to test the efficiency of my stone implements
i selected the largest and sharpest of the lot and com-
menced carving one of the fruits instantly mumba was
all attention to me the jagged thing was a poor make-
shift for a knife even for fruit but to mumba who
had never seen any edged tool except a natural sliver

  of rock the implement was simply marvelous i laughed
heartily when i saw the fixed stare of wonder and awe
upon his face and handing him the flaked stone i
signalled for him to try it

   as he half-fearfully took the bit of stone and tested
its edge he yelled with delight he was like a small boy
with his first jack-knife and he leaped about trying it
upon everything cuttable that he could find he severed
a bit of palm leaf with it half-whittled and half-cut a
stick of firewood and when accidentally he cut his own
finger and the blood flowed freely he pranced and danced
about with inexpressible joy a moment before he had
held only a tool a wonderfully useful implement to be
sure-but merely useful for peaceful purposes but
now he held a weapon something far more valuable and
his own injury was completely forgotten in his subse-
quent discovery

   i had gone back several thousand years and was
watching the reactions of the first human being to dis-
cover the use of stone weapons mumba was busy trying
his wonderful gift for some time and presently anxious
to exhibit it to his friends he started for the door but
i was anxious to witness the reception it would receive
from the populace so signing to him to slow down i
hurried with him to the main cavern

   the king was nowhere about but mumba soon
realized i wished to see him and hurried off return-
ing in a few moments with his ruler

   i had taken along the rest of my crude imple-
ments and their demonstration was received with
gratifying interest and surprise on the kings part i
presented him with several of the things and his de-
light was boundless as he hacked and whittled at
sticks and gloated over the results as pleased as a
child with a new toy

   anxious to show the king and his subjects how
useful the new tools would prove for skinning and
cutting up game i drew a rude sketch of an agouti
and summoning mumba tried to convey the idea that
i wanted one of the creatures brought to me at first
he merely grinned and repeated the word ikki evi-
dently thinking i wanted to learn the agoutis name
but presently as i pointed first at my sketch and then
at the stone tools he grasped the idea and dashed off
when he reappeared he was carrying a dead agouti
and as the king and his subjects looked on in wonder

i proceeded to skin the beast with a stone knife it
was hard slow work but to the monkey-men it seemed
nothing short of a miracle after i had partly skinned
the creature i beckoned to the king to try his hand
to me accustomed to steel implements the stone
seemed hopelessly dull and almost useless but to the
black monarch who had never known any sort of real
edged tool the blunt stone affair was a marvel and
with astonishing rapidity he skinned and cut up the
animal so interested and delighted were the people
that i then and there started to show them how they
could make stone tools and weapons for themselves
as i heated pebbles and chipped them into form the
people squatted about absolutely fascinated

  but when chuckling i passed the calabash of
water the stick and the hot stones to the king i
roared with laughter at the expression on his face
no doubt he feared my magic might injure him but
he was no coward at heart and with a look of grim
determination to do or die he took the proffered
stick dipped it gingerly into the water and allowed
a drop to fall on the stone then as the chip flew off
he leaped to his feet and yelled with glee and i soon
discovered that stone implement making was primarily
and most distinctly a savage art the very first ef-
forts of the monkey-men gave better results than any-
thing i had achieved and i had to concede that when
the king of the monkey men



it came to a matter of stone working the primitive
cave dwellers were far superior to civilized man i had
pushed the monkey-men ahead for several centuries on
the road to civilization and i decided that before i
left them-unless my freedom was far nearer than i
had reason to believe i would push them along for
several thousand years further towards a savage cul-
ture

chapter iv

ttitt ence as the days passed and drew into
i- weeks and i still remained a virtual pris-
oner of the monkey-men i devoted much of
my time to teaching my captors new arts and accom-
plishments

    impatient and anxious as i was to escape from the
valley i found that i was unconsciously becoming ac-
customed to my life among the monkey-men and was
finding a real interest in teaching the primitive race i
had long ago given up all hopes of escape until the
savages saw fit to let me go for every time i descended
from the caves i was kept within a restricted area
once in fact when i decided to test the matter and
disregarded the guards warning to turn back the fel-
low picked me up bodily and carried me back to the
tunnel where he released me

  very soon too i found it impossible to go even a
few steps into the valley a heavy rain began to fall
steadily the lake at the top of the cliff rose and
poured into the valley in a roaring cataract and the
whole valley was transformed into a shallow lake with
the scarlet trees rising above the surface of the water
this solved the puzzle as to why the savages had de-
veloped their strange habit of traveling through the
tree-tops the valley for several months of the year
was utterly impassable on foot but the tree tops al-
ways afforded a safe and easy route undoubtedly
through countless centuries the people had developed
their arboreal habits through sheer necessity of going
about at all times of the year very often i became
quite down-hearted at the thought of passing the re-
mainder of my days among the monkey-men but i al-
ways forced myself to give up such morbid thoughts
and my lot after all was not so bad i was healthy
unharmed with plenty to eat and as long as i was
alive and well there was always hope

    so making the best of my plight i busied myself
as i have said in trying to improve the lives and con-
ditions of the tribe and to mastering their language

   already i had acquired a sufficient knowledge of
the dialect to make my simple wants known and to
understand an ordinary conversation the monkey-
men had also made rapid strides since they had first
learned to make stone implements for with the acquisi-
tion of fairly sharp edged tools and weapons a won-
derful vista of possibilities had opened to them and
things they had never dreamed of were now readily
accomplished wooden slabs had replaced the leaves fo
dishes the skins of animals which formerly had been
torn or hacked to pieces in removing them from the
flesh could now be removed entire and were used for
many purposes sticks and limbs from trees could
now be cut and shaped whereas formerly fire had been
the only means the savages possessed for cutting wood
partly to amuse myself and partly to become expert in
their use i had patiently worked at making myself a
bow and several arrows in doing this i used my knife
of course but i was careful not to let the monkey-
men see the instrument always pretending to scrape
and whittle with a stone tool whenever mumba ap-
peared excellent mimics that they were the monkey-
men had no sooner seen my weapons in use than they

too began making bows and arrows with these they
found they could secure larger and more wary game
than with their blow guns the aptitude they showed
in using the weapons w-ts remarkable in fact they
were very much my masters in archery despite the
fact that i had practised constantly long before the
first monkey-mans bow was completed also i had
taught them to make wooden handles for their stone
tools and fearing i would exhaust my supply of paper
i had taught them to draw rude figures with charred
sticks on the walls of the caves several times how-
ever serious trouble had been narrowly averted al-
though the people still regarded me with superstitious
awe and respect yet the king was madly jealous of
my prestige at first the mere threat of a second ex-
plosion was enough to bring him to terms but after a
time he had overcome his dread of this and on one
occasion he demanded that i should give him my note
book and when i refused and threatened to produce
the terrifying magic of the fire the king had flown into
a rage and had ordered one of his men to take the
book from me by force for the fraction of a second
the fellow hesitated to obey and in that second i had
tossed three of my cartridges into the fire the series
of explosions that followed and thundered through the
cavern had caused a perfect panic and had won the day

   but my supply of cartridges was even more lim-
ited than my stock of paper and realizing i must
eventually rely upon other means for impressing the
king and his subjects i kept my brains busy trying to
think of some new stunt then one day i had an in-
spiration and i marveled that the idea had not oc-
curred to me sooner i ran across a useless water-
ruined match in one of my pockets and instantly i
thought of making fire by means of flint and steel the
only trouble was i had neither flint nor steel my only
steel available was my precious knife which i dared
not injure by such use and the nearest approach to
flint was the jasper-like rock used for making stone
implements

   however if i was to work this new magic i must
take some risks and i felt sure that somewhere i
could find a stone that would serve in place of flint
picking up several of the discarded stone implements i
tested each in turn by striking them with the back of
the larger blade of my knife some gave no sparks
whatever one or two produced sparks which i knew
were far too small to ignite any tinder but at last i
found a bit of quartz which gave rise to a shower of
bright hot sparks from steel the next and most im-
portant matter was to secure some tinder which could
be ignited by means of my sparks i racked my brains
trying to think of some highly inflammable material
i had often seen flint and steel used both by indians
and latin americans but for the life of me i could not
remember what tinder had been employed then i
kicked myself for a stupid ass as i remembered the
every-day flint and steel affairs used throughout south
america and in which a braided cotton wick served as
tinder not only was there an abundance of cotton in
the valley but i possessed quite a stock of the material
in my own ragged garments

  to ravel out some of the threads and to braid
these into a loosely stranded cord or wick was a simple
matter but to my utter disappointment the cotton
could not be ignited by the sparks i was about to
give up in despair and decided that the cotton was
either the wrong kind or else that the natives treated
theirs with some chemical when i bethought myself
of testing whether my cotton wick would actually burn

i touched it to the flames of my fire and it blazed up
quite brightly i extinguished it by placing my heel
upon it and sat pondering upon the reason for my

failure possibly i thought the cotton had been
slightly damp too damp to ignite by means of sparks
though dry enough to burn with the flame in that
case perhaps the heat of its blaze had dried it and it
would be well to have another try

   holding the bit of charred cotton under the
quartz i struck the stone with the knife and the next
moment gave vent to an involuntary shout of triumph
the cotton was glowing like a live coal and by blow-
ing upon it and placing some shreds of palm leaves
against it i soon had a blaze going over and over
again i ignited the c tton wondering why i had failed
at first until i dis avered that while charred cotton
could be ignited the unburned fibre could not i won-
dered what i would  ave done or what any man would
do if no fire was available for charring the tinder but
that was a contingency that did not interest me at the
time and i was fully satisfied at having discovered how
to produce fire by flint and steel in fact i was quite
pleased to know that ordinary cotton could not be
ignited for it would make my magic all the more
marvelous if at any time the king or one of his sub-
jects should get hold of my fire-making apparatus by
force

    i was very anxious of course to test the effect of
my discovery upon the king and the others but i de-
cided that the wise course was to keep it up my sleeve
so to speak for use in case of an emergency and little
did i dream how soon that emergency would arise

   that same night i was awakened by some slight
and unusual sound and opening my eyes without mov-
ing-a habit that had become second nature during
long years in the bush-i glanced about expecting to
see mumba the next instant some one leaped upon
me i was seized and bound and although i struggled
frantically i was utterly helpless in the grip of my
assailant then a stick was thrust into the fire and as
its blaze illuminated the room i saw two monkey-men
and the hideous old king gloating over me

  the monarch hd decided to do away with me in
secret why he had not killed me out of hand while i
slept instead of having me trussed up like a fowl
was a puzzle but the next moment the question was
answered holding the blazing firebrand for a torch
the king began searching the pockets of my clothing
chuckling to himself he drew out the cartridges and
my note book tossed the burning stick into the fire
and with a derisive laugh rushed off with his fellows
leaving me helpless and raging at my loss i under-
stood it all he had repeatedly seen me reach into my
pocket for the book he must have been keen enough
to notice that i took something from my pocket when i
caused the explosions and he had reasoned that by
possessing himself of my magic-making device he
could perform the same miracles himself that he had
not also secured my knife was merely accident for it
had been in my watch-pocket and the king had only
searched those pockets wherein he had seen me place
my hands he had overlooked one cartridge as well
but there was small comfort in this no doubt i
thought as soon as he had impressed his subjects with
his own power he would have me done away with and
it was the thought of how he might do it rather than
my death that troubled me suddenly my disquieting
thoughts were interrupted by the muffled roar of an
explosion from the direction of the main cavern the
king certainly was not losing any time then i heard
running footsteps and knew my execution was close at
hand

   the next instant mumba leaped into the room and
muttering incoherently quickly loosed my bonds
hardly waiting to thank him i seized my bow and ar-
rows and dashed down the passage after mumba

thoroughly enraged and determined to have a shot at
the king before i was again overpowered as i neared
the cave a low moaning wail came from within and
as i reached the entrance i halted in my tracks the
place was thick with dense smoke and reeked with the
odor of gunpowder while every occupant was prone
upon the floor the king was nowhere to be seen and
i glanced about in an effort to locate the old thief
mumba was tugging at my sleeve jabbering excitedly
and urging me forward unable to understand what
he wanted i stepped forward among the prostrate
savages the next instant a cry of amazement burst
from my lips

  sprawled upon the floor with arms outstretched
lay the king his ugly features ghastly with blood
while from what had once been his right eye the
ragged fragments of a brass cartridge shell pro-
truded

   he was dead killed by his own act one of the
shells had been hurled from the fire by the explosion
and had buried itself in his brain no doubt he had
bent close to the fire as he tossed the cartridges into
the flames and the exploding gunpowder had done the
rest

   for a brief moment i hesitated then stooping
quickly i snatched the crown of waupona feathers from
the dead mans head and placing it on my own
stepped to the throne an instant later the prostrate
people timidly raised their eyes and looked about
when they saw me seated upon the throne with the
royal crown upon my head a mighty shout arose then
they caught sight of their dead monarch and with one
impulse they knocked their foreheads upon the floor
here indeed was magic something most awful they
had seen their king throw the cartridges into the fire
the terrible noise and the flying embers had followed
and now the monarch was dead and the white man
materializing from nowhere was seated upon the
throne wearing the royal crown truly the magic of
such things was not to be trifled with and cautiously
raising their heads the monkey-men gazed upon me
as though i were an apparition born of the explosions
-as they no doubt believed me to be for a moment
i sat motionless gazing severely upon the people
then taking out my flint and knife and tinder i
struck a shower of sparks from the quartz and as the
cotton glowed and the bits of palm leaf burst into a
blaze i waved them impressively before my face it
was the finishing touch to a most dramatic scene and
once more the wailing moan arose and the terrified
awe-stricken people prostrated themselves again

  the king was dead long live the king

    with savage callousness the monkey-men paid little
heed to their late monarch whose body remained
sprawled where it had fallen but at an order from
me two of the fellows half-carried and half-dragged it
into one of the dark holes in the wall mumba mean-
while was squatted beside my throne gazing at me
with absolute adoration on his good-natured but ugly
face he was a faithful fellow and had proved him-
self my true friend and i decided it was time he was
rewarded

   so by signs and what i knew of the language i
told mumba to rise and made it clear to him and to the
others that he was second in position to myself-my
prime minister in fact for a time he did not seem
able to grasp the idea but when it finally dawned up-
on him he fell at my feet and then rising went
strutting about and gabbling to his fellows in such an
exalted supercilious manner that i fairly roared with
laughter despite my supposed dignity as a king

   a moment later he seized two men and dragging
the evidently terrified fellows with him approached
the king of the monkey men



me and by signs and words informed me that they had
aided and abetted the late ruler in his attack upon me
apparently mumba felt that his position as prime
minister carried with it the duties of chief of police
it was evident that his two prisoners expected to re-
ceive prompt and terrible punishment after all i
thought they were very likely blameless for the kings
word was law and to refuse would have meant death
moreover if they had been brave enough to help seize
and bind me even at their kings orders they would
no doubt prove brave and loyal to me so using
mumba as an interpreter i pardoned the fellows and
set them free the crowd received the verdict with
shouts of approval and the two fellows fairly grovelled
at my feet

   it was now past midnight so i dismissed the
crowd and returned to my own quarters followed by
mumba tired out with the exciting events of the
night i threw myself upon my rude bed and feeling
perfectly secure with mumba curled up like a watch-
ful dog in the doorway i fell off to sleep

  the whole affair seemed dream-like and unreal
when i awoke the next day but there was the royal
crown and somehow i felt happier and more free from
worry than at any time since i had been taken pris-
oner i no longer had the king to fear and being king
myself i felt sure i would not be under any restraint
in fact i could leave the valley at any time-provided
i could find a means of doing so as soon as the rains
ceased and the place became passable again

  all during my breakfast my thoughts were con-
centrated on the chances of escaping to scale the
cliffs was i knew impossible moreover to tramp alone
through the jungle wandering aimlessly in the forest
in the hopes of eventually finding friendly indians or
natives would be suicidal i had no firearms no white
man can subsist on the game or products found in the
tropical bush and i could not hope to carry enough
food to keep me any length of time no if i was to
escape it must be via the river somewhere the
stream must flow out of the valley and if i could con-
struct a canoe or raft i might be able to float to
civilization perhaps even to the coast but there was
the ever-present danger of rapids and falls i had no
tools for boat-building and even to construct a raft by
means of my pocket knife and stone tools would be a
herculean task

    moreover long before i could dream of setting
out-assuming  did manage to rig up some makeshift
craft i would have to provide an equipment and a
supply of food that would last for a considerable
period and before i attempted anything at all it
behooved me to learn more of the river and its outlet
but that was simple now for i could go about as i
chose and as the rains were now decreasing and the
valley was drying my explorations need not be delayed
much longer

    for the immediate present i decided to thoroughly
explore the caves and with mumba at my side i
started off he seemed to know every turn and twist
of the passages and every room or cavern in the whole
labyrinthine place and he guided me everywhere

   in one large chamber i came upon the ex-kings
family and harem they did not appear in the least
sorrowful over the demise of their lord and master and
all bowed down and prostrated themselves before their
new ruler it was apparently the custom of the monkey-
men for a new king to assume all the duties and ob-
ligations of his predecessor and mumba explained that
i was expected to take over the entire family and the
dead kings lady friends

  at this i demurred much to the amazement of
both mumba and the bereaved household but since

there was no thought of questioning a kings decision
and since they could not understand such a superior
being as myself they said nothing still the innumer-
able widows and their progeny set up a doleful wail
as i left them apparently deeply grieved and disap-
pointed because they were condemned to remain with-
out a royal head to the family

   having thoroughly toured the caves i wandered
through the tunnel to the valley the water had re-
ceded rapidly and i managed to walk a considerable
distance by choosing the higher ground almost un-
consciously my steps took me towards the spot where
we had first entered the valley and very fortunate it
proved that fate led me that way searching about i
soon found the whitened skeletons of my indian friends
evidently their bodies had been left where they fell
and while some bones were missing and i could not
find one skull-they had been washed away or had
been carried off by some beast or bird-i could identify
each skeleton as in my mind i reconstructed the
tragedy that had taken place so long before i would
have liked to bury the remains but that was impos-
sible ani the best i could do was to gather the bones
together place them in one pile and cover them with
stones from the nearby river bed wondering no
doubt what it was all about mumba aided me then
i remembered the two who had fallen from the ladder
and decided to add their bones to the little mound
the bones badly broken were there at the foot of the
precipice and as i stooped to pick them up an in-
voluntary exclamation of delight escaped me lying
beneath joss skeleton rusty and corroded but still
serviceable was the poor fellows prized machete to
me it was more precious than gold or diamonds a
thousand things not possible before would now be easy
with the keen-bladed heavy implement i could hew
down trees could build a raft might even essay the
construction of a canoe with it in my hand i felt like
a new man whirling it about i shouted and laughed
until mumba thinking i had gone mad hurried off to
a safe distance and squatted ready to spring into a
tree at any instant but when to try its corroded
edge i hacked with it at a shrub and the steel dull
as it was sheared through the stout stems mumba
looked on with wide-eyed wonder and gave vent to
strange animal-like grunts of absolute amazement

   i felt more confident more hopeful than at any
time since i had been in the valley even my gun had
i been able to find it would not have been so welcome
as the rusty machete for with but one remaining
cartridge my gun was a useless thing whereas with a
machete i felt equal to any emergency

chapter v

itt was a few days after my discovery of the
i machete that i started out to make as
thorough an exploration of the valley as pos-
sible the rains had now ceased the sun shone bright-
ly and with the exception of a pool here and there
the valley was again dry land the river however
still flowed in a turgid flood and i knew that the rains
in the higher lands about the valley were still falling
accompanied by mumba as always i wandered down
the valley following the general course of the river and
expecting to find a narrow canyon or rift in the walls
through which the stream flowed such an exit would
have been as good a barrier as a precipice as far as
the monkey-men were concerned for of course they had
no knowledge of boats and hence could not have issued
from their restricted habitat via the river but i was
doomed to bitter disappointment when i at last came
within sight of the rock cliffs that formed the lower

end of the valley i saw that the river flowed directly
against the surface of the precipice and vanished
within a yawning black hole that pierced the base of
the cliff that seemed to settle it i was as much a
prisoner as though i had been surrounded by steel
and concrete walls and sick at heart i felt that i was
doomed to spend the rest of my life in the valley of
the monkey-men there was but one ray of hope left
on the opposite side of the valley there might be some
spot where it would be possible to scale the walls but
to reach the further side i soon found was impossible
 must cross the river and the current was far too
swift too treacherous and too dangerous for me to at-
tempt to swim it my previous experience in the river
had been quite enough moreover i discovered that
not a monkey-man knew how to swim and hence none
of the tribe had ever been beyond the river this en-
couraged me in a way for i reasoned that if the
stream barred them effectually as it did there might
be an easy means of escape on the further side of the
valley the more i thought of it the more determined i
became to find out what lay beyond the river and the
idea of bridging it occurred to me it may sound like
a very simple matter to speak of building a bridge
across a narrow river where plenty of large trees are
available and under ordinary circumstances it would
not have been a difficult feat but if you consider that
my only serviceable tool was a much worn machete
and that the savages had never learned to cut down
trees had never seen or heard of a bridge and were
filled with unreasoning superstitious dread of cross-
ing the river the difficulties before me may be some-
what appreciated

   weeks elapsed before the crude bridge was in
place i was forced to make numerous stone axes to
supplement my machete to teach the savages how to
fell trees how to use rollers and levers and in fact in-
struct them in the simplest and most elementary prin-
ciples of mechanics before any real work was at-
tempted i soon found it easier to burn down the
trees than to cut them and after incalculable labor i
was rewarded with several long strong tree trunks
ready for use on the river bank at the narrowest por-
tion of the stream the next question was to place the
logs across from shore to shore to solve this problem
cost me many hours of anxious thought and an im-
mense amount of labor

   at last we erected a pair of shears of strong logs
bound together with vines which were raised above
the logs at the very brink of the river a crude
sheave made by slinging a roller of wood in two loops
of liana rope served as a pulley and by passing a
stout liana over this and by the gigantic ape-like men
hauling on it one end of the largest log was
raised high in air the rope was then made fast the
crowd of willing and powerful blacks lifted and pushed
the butt end forward and at last the log stood almost
erect so delighted were the savages when they saw
this seemingly impossible feat accomplished that they
almost ruined everything by releasing their holds on
the lines in order to dance and shout with triumph
but i managed to save the day by getting a quick turn
around one of the shear-legs in the nick of time

   when the hilarious monkey-men were once more
under control i directed them to lift the butt-end of
the suspended log and push it forward until at last it
etood erect with one end resting on the nearest bank
and the other towering twenty feet or more above the
shears stout stakes were then driven into the earth
behind the log to prevent its slipping back it was
lashed loosely to these so it could not kick up and
while my subjects looked on in wonder i cut the rope
with a tremendous crash it fell with its top resting

on the further bank of the river the delight of the
savages at sight of the log bridge was wonderful they
yelled and shouted pranced and leaped about rolled
on the grass and roared with glee then like a crowd
of school children on a holiday they raced across the
bridge which to their feet formed a safe and easy
roadway never in the history of their race had any
member of the tribe crossed the river and now that
the stream was spanned they frolicked on the farther
shore entirely forgetting their former superstitious
fears of the place

  the monkey-men might be perfectly satisfied with
a single round log for a bridge but it was far from
satisfactory for my purpose although i managed with
considerable difficulty to crawl across i forced the
savages to abandon their merrymaking and place a sec-
ond log along side the first by nightfall a good sub-
stantial bridge had been completed and the opposite
side of the valley was opened to me

  on the following day i crossed with mumba sev-
eral of the monkey-men trailing behind and started
on my explorations this side of the valley was far
richer in natural resources than the other for its wild
life fruits and vegetables had never been touched by
man deer tapir peccaries and other creatures were
abundant curassows and pheasants abounded and sev-
eral times i saw the royal purple wauponas at sight
of which mumba and his fellows always prostrated
themselves it was such a pleasant interesting district
that  did not feel greatly depressed even when i found
that there was no chance of ascending the cliffs and
it was while i was examining the rocky walls search-
ing for a possible slope up which i might climb that
i made a very interesting discovery i had come upon
a new rock almost as clear as glass which i felt sure
would lend itself to making very superior stone imple-
ments and i was gathering up a number of the best
pieces when i noticed a bit of stone of a semi-trans-
parent green color it was so much like a bit of a
broken bottle that at first i mistook it for a fragment
of glass and my heart gave an extra beat at thought
that some white man had visited the valley before me
but as i picked the fragment up and examined it i
realized that it was a natural formation a splinter
from a regular crystal then suddenly it dawned upon
me it was an emerald a bit of gem worth several
hundred dollars in the markets of the world but to me
a prisoner in the valley of the monkey-men worth
less than the flakes of common quartz i laughed de-
risively as i thought of it and was on the point of
hurling the precious bit of green against the cliff
when common sense returned to me suppose i should
escape from the valley for despite the apparent hope-
lessness of my plight i had not given up hope if i
did get away the emerald would go far towards mak-
ing my way easier it might even stand between me
and starvation for until i could reach civilization and
draw upon my resources i would be penniless ab-
solutely destitute but throughout the land even in the
most remote villages the green gem would be negoti-
able thus thinking i pocketed the emerald and with
renewed interest began searching for more i was
well rewarded among the debris crystals and por-
tions of crystals were everywhere and rapidly i
scratched and dug among the fallen rock and gathered
the green mineral while mumba seeing what i was
after fell to and secured twice as many as i found
myself but the supply was limited the emeralds had
obviously been brought down by a landslide from
some pocket or vein far up on the precipice and long-
ingly i gazed up trying to locate the spot and won-
dering what incalculable fortunes might still lie in
the cliffside even the gems i had were enough to keep
the king of the monkey men



me in comfort for a long time-provided i ever es-
caped and i found no little pleasure and amusement in
speculating on how i would spend my fortune if ever
i did reach civilization

  for several days thereafter i roamed the valley
hoping against hope to discover some exit i had over-
looked before each day too the river fell and its
current decreased and i noticed that the stream no
longer filled its tunnel through the cliff at the lower
end of the valley above the water there now showed
an opening several feet in height and fifty feet or
more in width and k was this aperture which finally
gave me the idea that seemed the only possible solu-
tion to my dilemma would it not be feasible to es-
cape through this tunnel to be sure such a venture
would be perilous in the extreme i would be entering
an unknown stygian passage which might very well
prove a trap

  for all i knew the tunnel might narrow or de-
crease in height so as to be filled with the racing
water at one or a hundred spots jagged rocks might
bar the way somewhere within the cliff there might
be falls or rapids or even if none of these menaces ex-
isted within the rocky wall the stream might dash
over a precipice or flow in terrific rapids where it
emerged on the farther side and i had no means of
knowing how long the tunnel might be the river
might flow under ground for miles or again the pas-
sage might be less than fifty feet in length all of
this i pondered upon and i knew that to go blindly
at it would be worse than suicidal but gradually as i
gave thought to the idea and it grew in my mind i
began to formulate plans to learn something definite re-
garding the tunnel and the stream before thinking
seriously of attempting to escape by river it was a
very simple matter once it came to my mind and
without delay i set about putting it into practice with
this end in view i constructed a miniature raft and
attaching a long coil of vine rope to this i allowed it
to float into the tunnel rapidly the line paid out as
the raft vanished within the aperture in the rock un-
til nearly two hundred feet had slipped smoothly and
without jerk or interruption through my fingers evi-
dently there were no rapids falls nor reefs for that
distance within the passage

   but i wanted also to be sure if the space between
water and roof remained constant and whether or not
the tunnel widened or grew more narrow i soon hit
upon a plan for determining these points cutting a
number of stocks i fastened them upright like masts
in my little raft and cut them at varying lengths the
longest nearly five feet in length the shortest barely a
foot in length then across the affair i lightly bound
slender sticks of varying lengths and again allowed
my test raft to float into the passage knowing that
when i drew it out again the condition of the sticks
would be a fairly accurate record of the conditions of
the passage and to my delight when the raft was
withdrawn i found only one of the upright sticks
broken and that the longest while not one of the
horizontal sticks was injured or missing assured
that the cavern roof was at least four feet above the
water for fully two hundred feet from the entrance
and that it was nowhere less than ten feet in width
i decided to make a personal inspection of the place
to do this would necessitate building a raft large
enough to float me and several days were consumed
in this work and in gathering a tremendous amount
of lianas for rope for i intended to penetrate far
beyond the two hundred foot limit on my explorations

    fortunately there were plenty of the light balsa or
 trumpet-trees in the valley and building a raft was a
 comparatively easy feat but to the monkey-men it

savored of magic and witchcraft and when they saw
the crude affair bobbing on the water and saw their
king step aboard and drift down stream they became
absolutely terrified and beat their breasts and wailed
evidently thinking their white monarch was about to
leave them forever

    it was with great difficulty that i reassured them
 and running the raft ashore disembarked but it was
 still more difficult to force them to permit me to board
 the raft once more and i knew that i would have my
 hands more than full if i attempted to enter the tun-
 nel in that case they would assuredly feel i was de-
 serting them and despite my impatience i knew that
 i would have to postpone my investigations until they
 became accoustomed to seeing me navigate the river
 hence for the next day or two i made daily trips
 down stream upon my raft each day approaching
 nearer and nearer my goal and as the novelty wore
 off and the savages learned by experience that i al-
 ways came ashore again they began to look upon my
 inexplicable occupation as a regular thing and quite to
 be expected but try as i might i could not induce
 one of them-not even mumba himself to set foot
 aboard the raft it was on one of these short voyages
 that i made another discovery which had i been other
 than a virtual prisoner would have filled me or any
 other man with excitement and delight the raft had
 grounded upon a sand bar and in order to get it free

i was forced to move several good sized cobbles in
doing this i caught an unmistakable yellow gleam
among the fine black sand in the recess left by the
stone forgetting everything forgetting my state my
surroundings even plans for my escape i dropped to
my knees and dug feverishly with fast beating heart
in the gravel the next moment with almost bated
breath i was gloating over an immense gold nugget
weighing fully ten pounds rapidly with machete and
hands i dug away the sand stopping every few mo-
ments to secure a rough yellow nodule until my first
excitement was exhausted and common sense returned
i sat back and roared with delirious laughter i was
still a prisoner of the monkey-mens valley and all the
gold in the world was of no slightest value to me until
i could be sure of escaping but like the emeralds the
gold if i ever left the place would be riches and i
determined that before i made any attempt to get
away i would lay in a good supply of the precious
metal

   it was two days after this strike that i decided
to attempt my long deferred exploration of the sub-
terranean stream it was with the utmost difficulty
that i made the monkey-men understand what i wished
them to do in fact mumba who by constant associa-
tion with me could grasp my meaning more quickly
than the others and who by the way was far more
intelligent than his fellows was the only one who
really understood my desires i had not over much
confidence in him and yet in a way my life depended
upon his and his companions carrying out my orders
i quite fully appreciated the fact that i was taking a
tremendous risk but my mind was made up i would
penetrate the tunnel to the limit of my vine ropes
unless forced to give up before then and i hoped at
that distance to be able to see the further outlet to the
place i had already prepared torches of resinous gum
and equipped with several of these i moored the raft
close to the tunnel entrance and repeated my instruc-
tions to mumba for the last time a strong line had
been made fast to the raft and to a stout stake driven
into the earth and fully five hundred feet of this lay
coiled neatly on the bank in addition i had pro-
vided a light line to be used as a signal cord and my
great danger lay in the possibility that the primitive


amazing stories quarterly

ape-like beings might confuse my signals or become
panic-stricken and desert me once i had vanished in
the tunnel however i consoled myself with the
thought that if worst came to worst i could probably
haul myself back to daylight for the rivers current
was now very slight by words and gestures and by
a demonstration i impressed my signals upon mumba
one pull at the light line and heavy line was to be
held fast two pulls and more was to be let out while
three pullr meant to haul in a bit fearful of what
might lay before me i lit my torch stepped upon the
raft pushed it from shore and ordered mumba to pay
out the line the next instant i floated in inky dark-
ness illuminated only by the ruddy glow from my
torch steadily i drifted on holding my torch aloft
moving it about and peering into the shadows but i
found nothing that would impede my progress the
current remained constant the roof and walls varied
little in height or width there were no jutting rocks
or reefs and the tunnel was nearly as straight as if
it had been drilled by man at last i reached the lim-
its of my ropes and still no glimmer of light ahead
the passage might continue so for miles for all i
knew yet the fact that it was navigable for such a
considerable distance gave me much encouragement
finding nothing to discover i jerked three times on
the signal line and presently felt myself being hauled
back whence i had come

  i have never seen more curious expressions on the
faces of any human beings than those of the monkey-
men when i reappeared they showed fear awe won-
der and sadness combined and all these gave way to
triumphant hilarious shouts when they realized that i
had not vanished forever it really affected me deeply
to see how much my subjects thought of me and i
experienced a pang of regret and felt something of a
scoundrel at the idea of deserting them however my
mind was now firmly made up i would steal down to
the place before dawn and taking my life in my hands
would attempt the passage of the tunnel as soon as i
could complete necessary preparations with the find-
ing of the emeralds and the gold and the thoughts
of civilization and its comforts which would follow
longer imprisonment in the valley became intolerable
better death in the subterranean stream than life in
the valley among the ape-like people

   but my preparations could not be made in a day
in the first place i decided that a raft would not serve
my purpose it was a cumbersome thing ill adapted
to running possible rapids too heavy for one man to
handle in swift water or to dislodge from a reef or
bar and if i succeeded in passing through the moun-
tain in safety its progress would be very slow upon
any stream i might descend to build a boat would i
knew be far too great an undertaking to consider
and even a dugout would be beyond me and my
monkey-men laborers but to construct a woodskin
such as i had often used and had frequently helped
make in the forests of guiana and brazil would be
neither impossible nor very difficult the main trouble
would be to find a tree with bark that could be
stripped from the trunk in one large cylindrical piece

   but fortune favored me trees very similar to the
purple-heart grew here and there in the red-leaved
forest and a test proved that their bark was perfectly
adapted to my requirements work was at once begun
and in due time i had a large tree felled and by dint
of painstaking work and with the aid of my priceless
machete i managed to wedge off a splendid section of
the tough thick bark the rest was comparatively
simple spreaders of hard wood were easily cut and
having nicked and bent the ends of the bark together
and having secured them in place with strips of a

rattan-like vine the spreaders were forced between
the gunwales and my canoe was complete many a time
two indians and myself had constructed such a wood-
skin in a few hours but here in the valley many days
of laborious work had been required the canoe how
ever was a complete success it floated buoyantly on
the water was steady and easily handled and the
monkey-men regarded it as another miracle by now
however they had become so accustomed to miracles
that they gave them little heed in fact they were
by this time so occupied with their own affairs that
it was often difficult for me to induce them to work
for me i had taught them many arts and crafts and
they had become most enthusiastic and interested in
their new accomplishments i had shown them how to
spin and weave for these purposes using the inner
bark of the seda virgin or lace-bark tree which was
as soft tough and strong as silk

  they had already used the material for the bits
of scanty loin-cloths they wore but they had never
discovered that it could be twisted or spun into thread
and woven into coarse cloth or made into hammocks
the monkey-men took to the latter as ducks take to
water and everywhere the comfortable swinging beds
had supplanted the piles of dried palm leaves in the
savages apartments fish hooks of bone and fishing
lines of bark had also been introduced and were in con-
stant use and i had taught the people to till the earth
and raise vegetables instead of grubbing for them here
and there i had even succeeded in twisting or spin-
ning the wild cotton and weaving it by hand and had
spent many hours trying to devise and construct some
sort of loom this however i found beyond me i had
far greater success in making baskets and once the
monkey-men had learned the principle they became
adept basket makers pottery had followed the baskets
and every member of the tribe was well supplied with
earthenware dishes basket and high finished and well
made stone tools implements and weapons indeed in
practically all savage arts and industries the monkey-
men were now fully the equals of the ordinary prim-
itive indians of the country and were rapidly develop-
ing a culture of their own for all i had to do was to
start them on anything and they progressed rapidly
evolving and introducing many ideas and innovations
themselves

    i have told all this as if it required little time and
i confess that time passed far more rapidly than i would
have thought possible i was really surprised when i
counted over my time strings on the day my canoe
was completed to discover that i had been with the
monkey-men for more than a year and that the second
rainy season was rapidly approaching if i was to
escape by way of the river i must act promptly be-
cause with the first heavy rains the tunnel would be
impassable for months fortunately i had few prepar-
ations to make ever since i had decided to attempt
the passage i had been gathering a supply of provisions
in the shape of dried meat tubers roots and vegetables
and i now had enough to last me several weeks my
hammock a bundle of dry sticks and leaves my flint
and tinder my machete my bow and arrows and sev-
eral torches completed my equipment i was ready to
set out at a moments notice but i was determined to
secure more gold from my rich placer for i reasoned
if i did reach civilization it would be most welcome
if i failed i would be no worse off with the gold than
without it and it was this determination that very
nearly cost me my life

   when it actually came to the point of leaving i
felt not a little sad and depressed for though i would
never have believed it possible i had become attached
to the monkey-men and felt as if they were old friends
the king of the monkey men



and my own people i was particularly sorry to desert
mumba and for a time i even considered taking him
with me but i realized that even if i could persuade
him to embark in my canoe and attempt the tunnel
passage-which i very much doubted-he would prob-
ably pine away and die of loneliness and homesickness
away from his people and among strangers

   and i found myself strangely excited and nervous
as the hour for my secret departure approached i slept
little the night before and was up before dawn and
long before the sun rose i had my belongings stowed
in my woodskin or bark canoe and was drifting down
the river towards the bar where i had discovered the
gold

   by the time i reached the spot it was almost
light and drawing the bow of my craft on the bar i
set to work with my machete and a wooden hoe i had
made the place was far richer than i had imagined
and in nearly every handful of gravel and sand which
i washed and sifted in a basketwork tray and panned
out in an earthenware basin i found nuggets no
doubt the finer flakes and dust were even more abund-
ant but i could not spare the time to secure these and
contented myself with the larger lumps and nuggets
of metal so interested did i become in my labors that
i did not realize how time was passing until my at-
tention was attracted by the loud rumbling of distant
thunder i was rather startled for according to my
calculations the first heavy rains were not due for sev-
eral days and thunder was most unusual except as an
accompaniment to these first torrential downpours
dawn i noticed was rapidly approaching the eastern
sky was already light and i saw that the sky was
overcast and that a bank of heavy black clouds hung
low over the summit of the cliff at the opposite end of
the valley all this i noticed and stopped to gather a
last basketful of gravel thinking to myself that with
a few more nuggets i would be satisfied for civilized
mans greed at sight of gold is irresistible then an-
other terrific crash of thunder echoed over the valley
reverberating from cliff to cliff startled realizing that
i must hurry if i was to get away before the storm
broke i shoved my canoe free from the bar grasped
my paddle and headed down stream it was fully two
miles by the river from the bar to the tunnel and be-
fore i had covered half the distance it was broad day-
light i noticed too that i seemed to be moving very
swiftly while the clouds had now spread until they
covered half the sky and peals of thunder and vivid
flashes of lightning were frequent still i did not
realize my peril did not dream that the cloud-burst-like
deluge would break for many hours perhaps for several
days

   not until i was close to the yawning black hole was
i aware that the rains must be falling with tropical
violence in my rear that on the highlands beyond
the walls of the valley the storm was raging and that
the lake which fed the river had been flooded and
was pouring its surplus water into the valley

   but as i saw the entrance to the tunnel before me
i realized this and was panic stricken but too late
feverishly i plied my paddle and tried to guide my
craft to shore but all my efforts were futile the river
was rushing me forward straight for the hole in the
cliff and its current held my frail canoe in the centre
of the channel despite my utmost endeavors to swing
it aside my heart seemed to stand still i felt sick
and faint with terror as i saw that already the water
filled the tunnel to within a yard of the arched roof
certain death faced me i felt sure long before i
could traverse the passage the water would have risen
until it filled the subterranean channel and vainly i

cursed myself and my insane cupidity which had de-
layed me

   all this happened in the fraction of a second the
next instant the black arch was above the dancing bow
of my canoe scarcely aware of my action i threw my-
self flat in the bottom of the woodskin shot into the
tunnel and was enveloped in absolute darkness

chapter vi

  rp rembling shaking expecting at any mo-
ment to feel the water pouring over the gun-
wales of my canoe to hear its sides grinding
against the rock roof as the water rose i lay there
ages seemed to pass there was not a glimmer of
light only the roar of rushing water filling the awful
underground tunnel gradually as the minutes passed
and the canoe still dashed onward unharmed i grew
calmer perhaps the passage was higher inside than
at the entrance there was a chance that i might yet
win through borne on the first crest of the flood and
cautiously i raised my paddle expecting to feel it
strike the roof above but it met with no resistance
and encouraged with new hope i managed to light a
torch and held it aloft barely discernible in the glow
i could see the walls of the tunnel sparkling and glint-
ing as the light was reflected from the crystalline rock
and fully ten feet above my head i saw the water-worn
roof with its pendant stalactites i breathed more
easily for the present i was in no real danger and
it seemed to me that the current was not as swift now

   but my canoe was gyrating wildly swinging
around and in imminent peril of capsizing or dashing
against a wall or some submerged rock fixing my
torch in the bow i grasped my paddle and guided the
canoe along the centre of the stream onward ever
onward i went often the river swept around sharp
bends and had the craft been left to itself it most
certainly would have been wrecked often too the
tunnel became very narrow but always there was
ample space between my head and the roof and grad-
ually full confidence returned to me then suddenly
swinging around a sharp curve my greatest dread was
realized the roof lowered abruptly and before me the
foaming torrent seemed to completely fill the channel
before i could cry out the flaring torch struck the low-
hung rock and was knocked overboard and barely in
time i ducked and threw myself prone in my canoe
this i knew was the end i would be drowned like
a rat in a trap and deeply bitterly i regretted ever
having left the valley of the monkey-men

   again and again i felt the gunwales of my canoe
bump against the roof above each time as it grated
against the rock and momentarily hesitated in its on-
ward rush my heart seemed to stop beating and i felt
that all was over often too as the craft grated
slowly along water slopped over the sides and i lay
there sick terrified half-submerged in icy water help-
less unable to rise awaiting death it was torture in-
describable agony beyond words and then just as i
felt the canoe stopping as the friction against the
roof was too great for the current to overcome the
darkness suddenly vanished and the tunnel was filled
with light the next instant the canoe shot forward
and with dazed eyes i gazed up at a vast stretch of
clear blue sky i was saved saved by the narrowest
margin for as i sat up blinking and shaking and
glanced back i saw the last few inches of the tunnels
mouth vanish in a mass of bubbling seething water

  with a mighty sigh of thankfulness and relief i
looked about i was floating on the surface of a broad
stream into which the river from the valley emptied
on every side stretched the dark dim aisles of heavy

forests rich green and cool and i shouted aloud and
cried at the welcome sight of so much greenery of
vine-draped trees with never a red leaf visible

   for hours i paddled and drifted down the stream
headed i knew not where but content to know that i
had escaped that somewhere ahead lay the coast and
civilization and that before me-with good fortune
and reasonable care-lay life and freedom among my
fellow men so anxious was i to put all possible dis-
tance between me and the valley i had left that i did
not even stop to eat ashore but munched dried meat
and fruit until well into the afternoon

   then overcome with weariness from my exertions
and my excitement i ran the woodskin ashore in a
little cove sheltered by vines and brush and making it
fast stepped into the forest within a dozen yards of
shore i routed a small herd of peccaries and with a
lucky shot brought down one of the beasts with my
arrow soon a fire was blazing and i dined well on
broiled pork and roast yams then refreshed and
sleepy i threw myself in my hammock and instantly
lost consciousness

  it was dark when i again awoke and feeling
thirsty i stepped towards the river to secure a drink
as i reached the bank and stooped to secure a cala-
bash from my canoe my eyes caught sight of a faint
glow far down the stream for a brief moment i
stared at it puzzled then my somewhat sleep-be-
fuddled mind cleared and i realized that it was the
light from a fire some one was near some sort of
human beings were camped within a mile of where i
stood were they friends or foes indians or white
men i had no idea where i was how far from civ-
ilization whether in an indian country or in a dis-
trict frequented by rubber gatherers or other natives
those whose camp fire cast a ruddy glare upon the
river might be white black or red and if the latter
they might be either friendly or hostile anxious as
i was to meet a fellow human being i knew i must
be cautious i must not run blindly into a camp of
savages who would kill me out of hand and perhaps
feast on my body afterwards but i was a skilled
bushman i felt confident that i could approach the
-re unseen and unheard and if the campers were
civilized or semi-civilized i would land if they ap-
peared to be hostile indians i could drift on down
stream out of their way accordingly i silently un-
fastened my canoe as silently stepped into it and
grasped the paddle and as noiselessly as one of the
shadows along shore i floated down towards the fire

   keeping close to the opposite shore and in the
heavy shadows of the jungle i rapidly approached
the light until i dared go no further then running
my canoe close under the bank i stepped ashore
taking advantage of every tree trunk and clump of
bamboos i picked my way along until i was opposite
the fire as i came within sight of it i gasped and
stopped in my tracks almost unable to believe my
eyes in a small opening in the forest blazed a large
fire and gathered about it were four naked painted
indians armed with powerful bows and long arrows
but it was not these savages who had rivetted my at-
tention but a fifth figure bound to a small tree
near the fire was a woman a girl whose scantily-clad
body and face clearly visible by the fire light were
unmistakably white

  who was she what was she doing here a captive
of those fierce-visaged indians even from the dis-
tance i could see that she was very beautiful and that
her face showed no signs of fear nothing but a re-
signed hopeless expression as she watched the indians
about the fire that they were hostiles was obvious
and it was probable that they were also cannibals my

heart sickened as i realized that their lovely captive
might soon furnish food to form a cannibal feast
my blood boiled while i gazed helplessly at the bound
white girl and her painted captors but what could i
do to aid her i was powerless against four armed
savages with a gun even with a revolver i might be
foolhardy enough to attack them counting on the sur-
prise and the terror of firearms to win the day but
unarmed except for an inferior bow and arrows what
chance had i and then suddenly as i thought of
fire-arms i had an inspiration back to my mind
flashed the memory of the consternation caused by my
exploding cartridges among the monkey-men i still
had the one cartridge the king had overlooked when
he had robbed me if i could only approach closely
enough to the fire to throw the shell into the flames i
might frighten the indians into flight and in the con-
fusion rescue the girl of course it was a wild hair-
brained scheme with every chance against its success
even if by craft and good luck i managed to come
within reach of the fire the odds were all against me
i might fail to throw the cartridge into the flames
it might not explode the indians might not be ter-
rified or they might recover from their fright before
i could release the captive or even if they ran and i
secured the girl they might and probably would pur-
sue us in canoes but had they canoes i had not
noticed any and i peered into every shadow and
searched every hiding place along the shore without
seeing a craft of any kind no i was convinced that
i had nothing to fear on that score and great as the
risks were i determined to take them

   better far to lose my life in an effort to save the
girl than to leave her in her sad plight and be haunted
for the rest of my life with msmory of her there
quickly my plans were formed retracing my steps
i shoved my canoe from shore paddled it silently up
stream beyond range of the fire light crossed quickly
to the opposite shore and allowed the woodskin to
float down stream just above the fire a small point of
land jutted into the water and here i moored my
craft fastening it to a paddle thrust into the soft
mud which could be withdrawn instantly i was now
so close that i could hear the voices of the indians
and though they spoke in such low gutteral tones that i
could not understand them i recognized their speech
as a dialect of the myankos-the fiercest most implac-
able cannibals of the south american jungles but
the discovery although it confirmed my fears for the
girls fate encouraged me the myankos were prim-
itive aloof hostile and were never in touch with
civilized man hence the chances that the exploding
cartridge would terrify them were greater but in
order to use the shell i must reach the fire and it
seemed an impossible feat to do this unseen and un-
heard from across the river however i had taken
note of every detail of the vicinity and my long bush
training served me well at one side of the fire and
with its limbs extending almost over it was a large
mora tree its squat trunk wide spreading roots and
tangled vines affording an easy means of ascent if i
could gain the shelter of the branches and worm my
way out on a limb i could almost drop the cartridge
into the flames below but to climb that tree without
noise and without attracting the attention of the in-
dians was i knew impossible

  but i had a scheme which i prayed and hoped
might serve me grasping two of my yams i crept into
the shelter of the mora tree and with a long breath
and with all my strength i hurled one of the yams into
the black shadows of the jungle beyond the fire in-
stantly as the tuber crashed into the brush the savages
leaped to their feet listened a moment and then grasp-
the king of the monkey men



ing their ready weapons three of them dashed towards
the sound even the girl turned and stared towards
the spot while the fourth savage remained tense and
expectant near the fire the next instant the second
yam crashed through the foliage and dropped with a
splash into the water down stream with a sharp
cry the fourth indian rushed away while the other
three shouted and hurried in the same direction
scarcely had the second yam left my hand when i was
breathlessly scrambling up the tree trunk quickly i
gained the lowest branches and heedless of bits of
falling bark and the rustle of twigs and leaves i
wormed myself along the limb until i lay hidden and
panting within ten feet of the fire i had no time to

spare already the indians were returning muttering
puzzled wondering what had caused the noises and
evidently nervous they were superstitious and no
doubt constantly feared an attack from enemies and
the mysterious crashing of my yams had put their
nerves on edge the stage was set the most hazardous
part of my undertaking had been safely accomplished
and i felt that good fortune and a benign providence
were with me waiting until the indians had gathered
about the fire i noiselessly took the cartridge from
my pocket opened my knife and held it in my teeth
and with fast beating heart and bated breath and
with a prayer to god i tossed the shell into the very
centre of the flames at the sound of its striking and
the little shower of sparks that flew up the savages
started and stared at the flames but they evidently
thought it merely a falling or snapping stick of fire-
wood and made no move to investigate the next in-
stant firebrands flew in every direction a volcano

the next moment he was up again and in tho moolight i
saw with terror that from feet to woist his yellow-brown
akin was bidden by a moving swarming black mass   

the indians were surrounded attacked by the most terrible
of jungle creatures-tho irresistible swarming millions of
the all-devouring nrmy-anta

leaped across the fire slashed through the girls bonds
with my knife and lifting her bodily in my arms
rushed with her to my canoe although she must have
been terrified despite the fact that i must have ap-
peared to her like another savage with my long hair
my unkempt beard and my patched ragged garments
she did not scream did not struggle and it was not
until i had dropped her into my woodskin and had
pushed from shore that i realized she was un-
conscious

  i had no time to lose already the indians were
recovering i could hear their shouts coming nearer
and i was obliged to pass through the light of the
remnants of the scattered fire and in plain view if they
returned to the scene

    frantically i plied my paddle keeping as far to-
wards the opposite shore as possible and aided by the
current of the stream i shot past the danger point
as my canoe vanished into the darkness beyond a
savage yell echoed from the rear and a long poison-
tipped arrow sang through the air and splashed into
the water within a yard of us but the next missile fell

seemed to erupt before the astounded eyes of the
myankos and the roar of the exploding powder echoed
through the vast silent forest with wildly terrified
yells their already tense nerves shattered and ab-
solutely frightened out of their wits the four indians
fled screaming into the jungle scarcely had the echoes
of the detonation died down and before the dense
smoke had cleared-almost before the savages had
dashed away-i dropped from my perch to the ground

far astern the shouts grew fainter and presently
feeling all danger over i ceased my mad efforts and
panting for breath let the canoe slip silently down
the river

   the girl was now stirring and presently she sat
up and stared about seeing me in the stern of the
canoe she peered at me intently for a space and then
spoke in a strange dialect i had expected to hear her
utter words in spanish i should not have been un-
duly amazed had she spoken in french or english
but it was a surprise to hear her use a tongue that
was evidently indian but undoubtedly she thought me
an indian i spoke to her in english and in spanish
and even managed a few words in patois french but
evidently they were as unintelligible to her as her
jargon was to me then i tried portuguese and the
few dutch words i knew but without result again
she spoke and this time i understood for she was
speaking in the dialect of the tucumaris which i
knew

  who are you bearded one she asked and why
have you taken me from the myankos and by what
magic was the fire made to leap into the air and
make much noise to frighten the myankos is it to
eat me yourself that you have made me your prisoner

   i reassured her told her i was a friend that i
was no indian but of her own race that i was taking
her to restore her to her people and that i had caused
the explosion which had frightened off the myankos
she listened and appeared incredulous evidently she
either did not fully understand my tucamari or else
could not grasp the meaning of what i said

    my people she declared as i ceased speaking are
the patoradi and you bearded one are not one of
them and yet you say you are of my race and are
taking me to my people

  i was amazed this lovely fair-skinned girl was
calmly and very sincerely informing me that she was
an indian a patoradi a tribe of which i had never
heard was i dreaming or had i taken leave of my
senses then i thought of the many tales i had heard
of so-called white indians tales i had always con-
sidered pure fiction based perhaps on albino indians
who are common enough was it possible that there
were white indians after all and that this girl was
a member of such a tribe

   are all the patoradis white-skinned like your-
self i asked her

    no bearded one she replied not like myself
but of the color of your skin bearded one

   that did away with the white indian theory for
i well knew that i must be the color of mahogany
and fully as dark as many an indian it must be then
that she was an albino but every albino indian i had
ever seen had been a repulsive-looking colorless-eyed
pimply-faced freak and this girl was beautiful her
hair was lustrous and golden-brown her eyes full and
a true blue and her skin although slightly olive was
tinted with pink and was not at all that of albino
nevertheless i decided she must be a freak for she
could not be white-no white person i felt sure had
ever been near the patoradis and she spoke only the
indian dialects i questioned her further who is
your father i asked and how do you speak the
tucumari if you are of the patoradis and how came
it you were a captive of the savage myankos

    my father bearded one was nakadi chief of the
patoradis and i am merima his daughter she replied
proudly much we trade with the tucumaris who are
our friends and so their tongue is known to us al-
ways have the myankos been our enemies and they
destroyed my village and killed my father and took

many prisoners all were eaten but myself who was
saved to be taken to the myanko chief to be eaten for
those of chiefs blood may only be devoured by chiefs
i have no people left bearded one and you cannot take
me to my people as you say but if you are a friend
as your tongue says and have no desires to eat me
then i thank you for your bravery in saving me from
the myankos but you have great magic and i am your
slave

   curling herself up in the canoe with a gesture of
finality she fell asleep as calmly and peacefully as
though a few moments before she had not been
destined for a cannibal feast or was not a homeless
fatherless waif in the woodskin of a strange being in
the heart of the jungle

   as i drifted on hour after hour and looked upon
the girl lying unconscious before me a great longing
filled my heart and tears welled to my eyes as i
thought back through the years to the time when my
daughter was lost to me now fate brought this
fatherless girl to me i determined that if ever we
reached civilization i would adopt her as my daughter
to fill the place of my long dead child

   what if she were an indian a partial albino as i
knew she must be she was as fair as many a white
woman she was beautiful her eyes and her every ex-
pression and act bespoke high intelligence training
and education would fit her to hold her place and be
a credit to me and if we won through she would be
rich for did i not have a fortune in emeralds and gold
comforted by such thoughts breathing wordless thanks
to the god who had guided me i drifted on until the
raucous notes of parrots and toucans and the calls of
countless birds warned me that dawn was approaching
and the velvet black sky grew blue and the stars were
snuffed out and the shadowy forest was clear and
sharp in the light of sunrise 

chapter vii

erima awoke as the first rays of the sun
lyl shot athwart the river and dispelled the
mists of night for a moment she looked
puzzled and then her face cleared and she smiled and
spoke the morning greeting of the tucumaris

    manuaida may the day bring happiness 
bearded one

    and to you also manuaida i responded

   running the canoe ashore i soon had a fire going
and merimas looks of wonder and surprise as i
struck a light by flint and steel was as great as had
been those of the monkey-men the first time they
had witnessed the seeming miracle

   but she would have none of my preparing the
meal that was her work she insisted the work of a
woman and not of a great chief and she added i was
a mighty chief indeed for had i not alone rescued her
from the myankos had i not brought thunder from
the sky to destroy and frighten them and did i not
have the chiefs crown of purple feathers

   she was as gay and light-hearted as a child and
i marvelled that she could have recovered so quickly
from her recent trying experience and her bereavement
but the indians as you doubtless know take their sor-
rows and troubles lightly and do not make their lives
miserable by thinking of the past as do white men
and theirs is a very sensible habit too as she busied
herself over the fire i got out the largest piece of
bark-cloth i had and after washing it well i hung it in
the sun to dry for i intended to have merima use it
for some sort of clothing oddly enough although i
had long been accustomed to seeing indian women
the king of the monkey men



nude or nearly nude yet the sight of merima with
only a very small portion of her lovely body and fair
skin covered by a scanty skirt-like strip of bark-
cloth troubled me and struck me as immodest

   she was highly amused when i handed her the
piece of cloth and explained my wishes but she was
ready to obey mo in anything and draped it about her
shoulders with a feminine cleverness which was amaz-
ing as we slipped down the river that day merima
told me much about her tribe her life and the habits
and customs of the petoradis the more she told me
the more i marveled that i had never before heard of
the tribe but after all it was not so very surprising
for while i was familiar with much of the country
and many of its indian denizens still i knew that
there were countless tribes dwelling in the remote
fastnesses of the unexplored jungles whose existence
was unknown even to other aborigines and i realized
that i had been and still was in a very remote portion
of the land the village of the metakis where i had
first run across the waupona was far from the coast
and settlements from there i had travelled countless
miles further into the interior to the valley of the
monkey-men and for all i knew i was now farther
inland than when i was in the valley i tried to learn
from merima where the patoradis dwelt but her
knowledge was very vague and she had not the least
idea of the direction in which she had been carried
by her savage captors all she knew was that her
home had been within sight of large snow-capped
mountains and beside a river but from what she told
me of the people and their habits and food i knew
that they must have dwelt at a comparatively high al-
titude on one of the great inland plateaus she was of
course very curious about me and my people but she
was quite unable to grasp the idea of any race of men
other than indians or of any land other than that
to which she was accustomed

   when we stopped at noonday for lunch i suc-
ceeded in killing a curassow or wild turkey and while
merima was preparing this i searched about and
soon found a good sized seda virgin tree from this
i obtained a large sheet of the cloth-like inner bark
and by roping the ends of this by means of strong
cord made of twisted strips of the same bark i fash-
ioned a rough and ready but quite serviceable and
comfortable hammock for i had no intention of letting
the girl sleep in the canoe or on the ground exposed
to the attacks of ants and other insect pests and she
had positively refused to let me give up my ham-
mock for her merima laughed gaily at my bag-shaped
makeshift and after our meal she hurried about and
gathered a great bundle of the silkgrass that grew
abundantly close to the water throughout the after-
noon she worked diligently shredding the grass and
twisting the fibre into cord and by night she had a
number of balls of strong soft twine with which she
informed me she planned to weave a real hammock
but a good hammock cannot be made in a day and it
was more than a week later that she at last swung
her new hammock between the trees she was a most
self-reliant creature and had a far greater knowledge
of bush resources and native handicraft than i pos-
sessed and i often wondered how any white girl
would have fared if left to her own devices in a jungle
where merima could have lived quite comfortably if
she had found herself alone

   constantly too as we drifted along from dawn
until dark i was planning for her future barring ac-
cidents or the remote chance of running afoul of
hostile indians we would eventually reach the settle-
ments and at the first outpost of civilization i would
take steps to legally adopt merima as my daughter i

realized that there might be obstacles to this if the
swarthy officials saw her and cast covetous eyes upon
her for after all she was an indian and in the minds
of the natives indians are all fair prey but the
chances were that the first place we reached would
be some tiny village with a ragged barefooted cor-
regidor or alcalde who would be quite willing to do
anything within or without the law in return for one
of my nuggets or a small emerald even if we came to
a large town and i had difficulties with the legal mat-
ters i had enough wealth to buy any latin american
official who ever lived moreover where there was a
settlement there also would be a church and a padre
and my first step would be to have merima baptized
and have a priest act as her godfather after which
her status in the community would be entirely altered
merima however was of course an utter pagan and
in order to carry out my plans she would have to pos-
sees some knowledge of the christian religion and a
desire to join the church with this in mind i de-
cided to devote my time to instructing her i told her
of my religion and attempted to teach her english
but that was easier said than done although i could
readily speak and understand the tucumari dialect
yet indian tongues have their limits and while they
are very complex and rich yet they possess no equival-
ents for many of our commonest words and no means
of expressing many of our civilized ideas and thoughts
merima listened intently the while busily working at a
supply of lace-bark which she was deftly transforming
into a wrapper-like dress-for once she understood i
wished her clothed she was anxious to please me i
could see she regarded my words as some sort of a
fairy tale or legend i tried my hardest to explain my
beliefs and to impress her she was a very intelligent
young woman and quick to guess at my meaning and
to supply words where i failed and she soon began
to understand and to take a real interest and to ask
questions i must confess that many of her queries
would have baffled a far more advanced theologian than
myself and many of her interrogations set me to
thinking along lines which had never before occurred
to me why she asked was the christian god superior
to the gods of the patoradis all her life she had been
given health food shelter friends and everything she
desired could my god give her anything more but
i pointed out the indians gods had failed them when
the myankos attacked them

    and does the bearded ones god never fail his
people she demanded do the people of my bearded
one never have wars and are they never killed

  i flushed and hesitated but i was forced to con-
fess that the christian god apparently allowed his
worshippers to meet with disaster as frequently as
did the gods of the indians merima nevertheless was
quite willing to embrace christianity not because she
believed in it or had been converted by my words but
because she felt that it was my wish and since it was
my religion she should make it hers however while
such a convert might not be all that a strict church-
man might desire my purpose would be served she
could i knew understand any ordinary questions that
might be asked her by a priest and she had a fairly
good idea of the underlying basis of christianity
later on she could be properly instructed from all
this it might be assumed that i am a deeply religious
man but i am not i do not belong to any particular
sect or church and i firmly believe that every man and
woman has a right to worship any deity or deities he
or she prefers i have dwelt among many races with
many beliefs and it seems to me one religion is as
good as another provided a person has true faith and
lives up to the teachings of that religion in fact i

have never had any patience whatever with those mis-
guided individuals or sects who are forever striving
to force their own personal beliefs and religions down
the throats of others who do not agree with them as
far as i personally was concerned merima might have
remained a pagan forever or rather i should say
she might forever have adhered to the beliefs of her
tribe but i knew in a catholic country where the
church possesses vast power and influence it would be
both to her advantage and my own to have her a
christian-outwardly at least i was not at all sure as
a matter of fact that i could legally adopt her until
she had been baptized

  hard as it proved to make her understand my
outline of christianity i found it still harder to teach
her my language she was anxious enough to learn and
took a far greater interest in my efforts to teach her
english than in my attempts to convert her to my
faith but her tongue lips and vocal cords accustomed
only to producing the gutteral peculiar sounds of her
native dialect were ill adapted for pronouncing english
words often her attempts to repeat a word after me
were highly amusing and we both laughed heartily
as she pursed her lips screwed up her face and slowly
and painstakingly tried to pronounce some word only
to fail utterly but she was a persevering little thing
and enthusiastically desirous of succeeding and grad-
ually as the days passed she learned to utter the
words and to my amazement when she did master
the sounds she spoke the words without the least
accent she was most particular in this respect and
would not speak a word which she could not pronounce
perfectly this made her progress rather slow and i
foresaw that it would be a long time before she could
express herself readily or even thoroughly understand
english for so highly developed was her sense of
sound-the slightest varying shade of accent or pro-
nunciation of an indian word changes its meaning-
that a word carelessly spoken or mispronounced was
entirely unintelligible to her

   but if my attempts to instruct merima accom-
plished little in some ways yet they served to pass
the time and the days sped swiftly at first i had
forgotten to keep my string calendar but i soon
rectified this and on the third day after finding
merima i again resumed my daily knot-tying hence
i knew it was on the eighteenth day after emerging
from the tunnel that we struck the first rapids to
be sure we had several times passed through swift
broken water but nothing that was dangerous or diffi-
cult and the canoe had behaved wonderfully but now
ahead stretched a long series of foaming rock-filled
rapids stretched ahead alone i should not have hesi-
tated to have run boldly through them but with the
added weight and the responsibility of merima i was
rather fearful of attempting it in my frail craft
mooring the woodskin at the head of the rapids i
stepped ashore and with merima by my side i
walked down stream examining the rushing water lo-
cating the rocks and speculating on my chances of
running the gauntlet safely they were not bad as
rapids go in the bush and luckily there were no true
falls or cataracts had the stretch of broken water
been shorter however i would have laboriously por-
taged the canoe around rather than take the risk but
it was an impossible task to portage the craft for
over a mile through the forest and merima laughed
at my hesitation declaring that there was no danger
and that many a time she had run far worse rapids
by herself

   moreover she could i knew swim like an otter
for she regularly took her morning dip and appeared
as much at home n water as on land with some

misgivings therefore i shoved the canoe from shore
and into the racing current

   merima had grasped the extra paddle i had pro-
vided and standing in the bow wielded the paddle
and swung the bobbing racing craft from jagged
black rocks with all the consummate skill of an indian
boatman as she stood there her long hair flying
swaying and undulating in perfect rhythm to the
wildly gyrating motions of the frail canoe plying
her paddle first on one side and then the other shout-
ing back a direction or a warning to me and with
her face flushed with excitement i gazed at her in
admiration and thought what a wonderful specimen
of perfect womanhood she was

  without her aid i doubt if i would have come
through the rapids in safety as it was we never
grazed a rock never shipped a pint of water and in
almost no time shot from the last broken water into
the tranquil river beyond

  throughout that day and the next we traversed
rapid after rapid and thus i knew that hitherto we
must have been traveling across the fairly level plateau
of the far interior and that now we were descending
the slope towards the lowlands and the sea this was
encouraging but i was aware that many miles and
many days of travel might still lie before us there
might be even worse rapids and falls ahead but
each hour that we sped on we drew nearer and nearer
to the haunts of civilized men also there might be
settlements or even good-sized towns far up this river
often too we had passed the mouths of other streams
some mere creeks other good-sized rivers which made
me feel sure that the stream we were following was
a main river or the tributary of some great river
so far too we had met no indians and this also con-
vinced me that we were on a major stream for the
indians seldom dwell upon such large rivers they
prefer the smaller streams and creeks still we had
maintained a sharp lookout for chance canoes drawn
upon the banks or for signs of savages for we never
knew but that when rounding some bend or turn we
might suddenly find ourselves face to face with a
boat load of hostiles or a village of enemy indians
more than once we had found unmistakable proofs of
the presence of savages in the neighborhood

  once we had found a dead deer floating in a
backwater and with the broken shaft of an arrow
protruding from his neck at another time merimas
sharp eyes had detected bits of shredded silk grass
floating from the mouth of a small creek twice we
had seen the thin blue spirals of smoke from indian
camps rising above the forest in the distance and
on another occasion as we passed by the half-con-
cealed opening that marked a sluggish itabu or side
channel merima had raised her hand for silence and
from afar off in the jungle we had heard the yelping
barks of indians dogs despite her recent experience
with the myankos merima seemed less fearful of meet-
ing indians than was i partly she had a most grati-
fying and supreme confidence in my ability to over-
come anything or to triumph over any savages based
of course on my lucky and successful rout of the
myankos but such an act could not be repeated
and i was well aware that i would stand no dhance
with only my bow and arrows and my maehete for
weapons if we should meet hostile indians of course
the indians we might meet might not be enemies for
by far the greater number of aborigines in the coun-
try are peaceable and friendly had i known where
we were i would have been more at ease for i should
then have known pretty well what tribes we were
likely to meet but there was no use worrying over
it so far fate luck or providence had been with me
the king of the monkey men



and being something of a fatalist and a believer in
luck i felt fairly confident that we would come
through in safety

   we had camped as usual beside the river but
well hidden from any chance voyagers on the stream
and as always we had been careful to extinguish the
last glowing spark of the fire which might serve to
betray our presence for i felt that the danger of
savage men was far greater than the danger from the
vampire bats which are kept at a safe distance by the
light from a fire

   it seemed as if i had barely closed my eyes when
i found myself awake keyed up listening intently as
if through my subconsciousness some danger signal
had penetrated from her hammock beside me i
could hear merimas regular breathing not an un-
usual sound broke the silence and yet i was filled
with a strange sensation of dread of imminent peril
and without moving i turned my eyes towards the
forest with its black shadows blacker by contrast
with the pale light of the waning moon instantly
my heart seemed to cease beating and i felt paralyzed
with gripping fear within twenty yards of my ham-
mock stood a naked painted indian his low blow-
gun resting across a small tree and pointed directly
at me beyond him like shadows creeping along the
forest edge were two more savages each armed with
a blowgun and a powerful bow and arrows silently
stealthily approaching merima and myself i felt ab-
solutely sick with terror to move a muscle or utter
a sound meant certain death for myself and death or
worse for the girl at my first word at my first
whisper to merima the indians would spring upon us
and even before they reached our hammocks a poisoned
dart would bury itself in my flesh i was absolutely
helpless powerless even to warn my companion of her
approaching doom the flicker of an eyelid might
bring the deadly missile from the blowgun and i
marveled that my fast throbbing heart and fear-
shaken limbs had not already warned the savage that
i was awake nearer and nearer to the hammocks
crept the other two indians the seconds seemed like
hours and the sound of my heart beats seemed to echo
through the silence of the night and to shake my
hammock

   sweat poured from my skin chills ran over me
and i had an insane desire to scream to spring up to
at least warn merima before the blow fell

  then a strange an amazing thing happened sud-
denly the indian with the leveled blowgun turned his
head and glanced downward at his feet the next
instant with a low cry of horror he leaped back
dropping his weapon as he did so

   at the sound the other two halted and wheeled
in time to see their companion dashing madly into the
forest before he had covered a dozen yards panic
seized them and they too turned and fled scarcely
had they started to run when the first fellow stumbled
and fell uttering a fearful blood-curdling scream the
next moment he was up again and in the moonlight
i saw with terror that from feet to waist his yellow-
brown skin was hidden by a moving swarming black
mass instantly i understood the reason for the sav-
ages mad terror for their panic-stricken flight the
indians were surrounded attacked by the most terrible
of jungle creatures-the irresistible swarming mil-
lions of the all-devouring army-ants

   merima aroused by the first yells of the savages
had started up and had cried out in alarm at sound
of her voice my senses had returned to me and in a
hoarse terrified voice i warned her not to stir from
her hammock and in rapid terse words explained what
had threatened and what was taking place

   brave jungle-trained obedient girl that she was
she remained motionless half-sitting up in her ham-
mock her eyes like my own staring fascinated at
the tragedy taking place before us frantically but
vainly the indians were struggling against the hordes
of biting ravenous hunger-mad ants which on every
side surrounded and overwhelmed them covering the
ground with a living undulating carpet that pushed
steadily onward like a living torrent and relentlessly
devouring every living thing in its path over the
shrieking indians the creatures swarmed and from
under our hammocks from all about from the trees
near came the sound of their moving bodies and
hungry jaws like the rustle of a wind among dry
leaves i shuddered and i saw merimas eyes widen
and her face blanch as glancing about we saw the
black millions covering the earth swarming up the
trees covering everything except our hammocks within
which we were safe from attack for the army-ants will
not cross a rough rope meanwhile the indians yells
were growing fainter one of the three with blood
pouring from thousands of bites had broken through the
ant-army and shrieking like a maniac had vanished in
the jungle another was still fighting madly brushing the
swarming creatures from his eyes uttering heart-rend-
ing cries of agony blinded beset on every side and al-
ready doomed the third the last to take alarm had
been silenced he had been overwhelmed and was now
hidden under the swarming ants in a moment more
the other savages cries turned to groans he sank to
the earth and soon all that marked the presence of the
two were formless motionless mounds of ants tremb-
ling and nauseated i watched the seemingly endless
army of insects pass on its devastating way apparently
never stopping even to devour their human victims

  for hour after hour we lay there with staring
eyes not daring to stir from our hammocks until at
last day dawned and by the welcome light we saw
the last few stragglers of the ant-army scurrying
over the ground and vanishing in the forest a short
distance away two piles of clean-picked white bones
and two grinning skulls were all that remained of
the fierce savages from whom we had been so mirac-
ulously saved

   staggering from my hammock i fell upon my
knees and thanked god fervently for our deliverance
for a moment merima watched me curiously and
then dropping to her knees beside me she too in
her own way gave thanks to him who had guarded
us through that terrible night

   as i rose merima gazed at me fixedly for a mo-
ment a peculiar expression in her eyes yesterday
bearded one i had no faith in that god of yours
she announced i believed only in your magic and
the gods of the patoradis but neither your magic
nor the patoradi gods could have sent the ants to
kill our enemies so it must have been your god
and henceforth shall i too worship him

chapter vlii

cut t was four days after our miraculous deliver-
i ance from the indians that we came to a
fork in the river directly in its centre it
was split by a wooded point and i had no possible
way of determining which branch to follow how-
ever it made little difference for eventually both
streams must lead to the coast i longed to reach
the settlements by the shortest route and was there-
fore fearful of taking the longest deciding to trust
to the indians instinct and to womans intuition
i left the choice to merima and without hesitation she
took the left hand stream


amazing stories quarterly

   very soon i knew we must be approaching the
lowlands we had left all the ranges and cataracts
astern yellow and blue macaws appeared in place
of the red and green species of the interior water
fowl and herons increased in numbers fan-palma
and ivory-nut-palms appeared among the trees the
river flowed sluggishly and along the banks were
growths of broad-leaved water plants rushes and giant
lilies all great danger of hostile indians i felt was
over there were no more rapids to run and feeling
more joyous and elated than i had felt for months i
paddled  with merima helping and now looking
quite civilized in her loose single garment that fell
from her shoulders to her ankles and with her hair
neatly braided and coiled each day the river widened
and more and more indications of the low lands were
apparent until the current completely ceased and we
found ourselves floating on the placid surface of a
large lake everywhere were jungle-covered islands
and on every hand stretched the jungle-covered shores
with no visible outlet i was bitterly disappointed and
could see nothing to do but paddle back up miles of
river and descend the other branch but before
abandoning all hope i decided to paddle around the
shores in search of some stream that flowed from the
lake i found not one but a score all were small
however and one seemed as promising or rather as
little promising as another but it was worth trying
and if after a reasonable time the stream i selected did
not increase in size or if i found it was not flowing in
a general northerly direction i could still retrace my
way so pushing through the plants and low-hanging
vines that almost concealed the entrance to one of the
outlets i followed the stream into the jungle very
quickly the stream broadened the current increased
and by nightfall we were again on a large river

   encouraged we chatted and laughed as we ate our
evening meal and i told merima my plans for the
future somehow up to then i had never mentioned
my idea of adopting her

   but she was elated at the idea in fact more
than elated for she could not express her delight at
thought of having found a new father and it was
with difficulty that i could prevent her from grovelling
before me as the monkey-men had done when i was
their king

  the next morning we started at dawn and at any
time now i half expected to see a clearing a village
of friendly indians or signs of mans presence

   scarcely two hours had passed after leaving our
camp when as we swung around a curve a surprised
exclamation burst from merimas lips and the next
second i uttered a glad triumphant shout less than
a mile distant the jungle ended cleared fields covered
a low hill and shining brightly in the morning sun-
shine were houses they were miserable shacks to
be sure native huts of adobe and thatch but the houses
of civilized men and above them rose the squat tower
of a church surmounted by a cross sharply silhouetted
against the clear blue sky never had a tiny native
village been more welcome to human eyes than was
that first sight f santa ysobel to me and to merima
it was the greatest wonder the most marvelous thing
in all her life never before had she seen any house
save the open bcnab of an indian and to her the clus-
tered hovels on the hill were most amazing structures
and the church must have appeared like a veritable
skyscraper

   we attracted little attention as we ran the canoe
ashore beside a dozen dugouts at the landing place
below the village the few ragged mulattos and
mestizos who lounged about appeared to take little
interest in the bearded stranger with garments as

threadbare as their own who stepped from a canoe
accompanied by an indian girl they were far too
accustomed to seeing travellers from the bush to show
any curiosity and to them no doubt i appeared
merely another bush trader with a half-breed com-
panion but had merima possessed wings and had
i worn horns i doubt if the natives would have been
roused from their inherent and chronic state of lazi-
ness and lethargy as we passed up the hill merima
staring about with wondering eyes at everything a
few unkempt women peered at us from their door-
ways naked children scurried from the sunbaked lit-
tered street and the few men we saw glanced at us
in half-hearted fashion as if rather wondering who
we were and on what errand and yet not possessing
enough vitality to ask

  in his humble adobe dwelling beside the ancient
church i found the padre a white-haired lean-faced
kindly-eyed priest who gravely but smilingly wel-
comed us and asked in what manner he could serve
me and as i related my tale or as much of it as
had to do with merima and explained my plans and
desires he listened attentively nodding now and then
and uttering half-suppressed exclamations of amaze-
ment at times until i had ended

  it is a strange a most marvelous tale my son
he exclaimed you have seen things which have been
granted no other man and through all you have been
led and guarded by our heavenly father in my
youth i too was filled with the spirit of adventure
and wandered far and among strange peoples striving
ever to spread the true faith many indian tribes did
i know-and alas i fear they proved barren ground
for the word of god-and in my wanderings i have
heard mentioned the name of the patoradis though
never did i reach within many leagues of their land
but the tucumaris i knew well and their language
i understand and speak somewhat though tis years
since my ears heard words or my tongue tried to form
the sounds of the dialect hence it is well that the
maiden speaks that tongue for thus can i converse
with her truly my son he continued it is a
worthy deed you have in mind-to adopt the maiden as
your daughter and i doubt if you will find it a dif-
ficult matter for don ramon the alcalde is a good fel-
low at heart-though he drinks over much and is not
too attentive to his duties and he is a good friend of
mine i misdoubt if he knows the law or if he has
the papers necessary to be signed but in such mat-
ters i can act for the state as well as the church
and all don ramon need do is to sign his name and
affix his seal but as you thought my son first must
the maiden be baptized and registered as a christian
and a communicant of my church for under the law
the pagan the indians are wards of the government
and may not be treated like other citizens and a
most worthy deed have you done in teaching the child
the truths of christianity and in converting her to a
belief in our true god now my son will i summon
old marta and give the maiden into her care to be
properly clad then when we have dined conversed
with-merima is it not-to assure myself of her
desires i will give her baptism and fill out the papers
frhat will be signed by don ramon

   rising he clapped his hands and in response to
his summons a stout good-natured old indian woman
appeared and in a few words fray benedicto gave
her his orders merima poor girl looked thoroughly
frightened and hung back for of course she under-
stood no word of what any of us had been saying
as the conversation had been all in spanish but
when the kind-faced padre spoke to her reassuringly
in the familiar tucumari and i also added a fejg
the king of the monkey men



words she smiled and followed old marta willingly

  then fray benedicto thoughtfully suggested that
i too needed proper garments and calling a mestizo
boy he ordered him to supply anything i might need
soap a shave and clean whole clothes though they
were no more than coarse native garments of cotton
transformed me into a new man and as i entered
the cool sala fray benedicto uttered a cry of amaze-
ment at my altered appearance he had been pacing
back and forth as i entered a perplexed troubled look
upon his face then having recovered quickly from
his first surprise at my transformation he came for-
ward and laid a hand upon my shoulder

  his manner and his expression gave me a pre-
monition of something wrong and my heart sank at
thought that it must have to do with merima and
his first words convinced me my fears were justified

  my son he said bravely  fear that it will
not be possible for you to adopt the maiden-at least
for the present i have made-

    not possible i cried why not if it is a ques-
tion of money i have wealth and to spare-gold and
emeralds if your don ramon-

   he held up his hand and smiled nay he said
interrupting my words it is not a matter of money
as you think merima the patoradi you could have
adopted in full compliance with the laws within the
hour but the maiden is no indian

    not an indian i gasped nonsense of course
shes indian an albino or partial albino perhaps but
an indian just the same

   fray benedicto smiled and shook his gray head

 so i too thought until a few moments ago he said

 but indians-not even the patoradis-do not vaccinate
and the girl bears the mark of vaccination who she
may be i know not but that she is white and no
indian i am certain

   i sank back into a chair utterly overwhelmed in-
credulous and unable to believe my ears

  but but i stammered if shes not an indian

if she is white how-what-

  if you doubt it here is further proof an-
nounced fray benedicto

    old marta found it among the savage ornaments
the maiden wore

  as he spoke he handed me a small golden trinket
a tiny worn locket an unmistakable example of civ-
ilized mans workmanship

   for an instant i gazed dully at the thing and
then an involuntary cry came from my lips and i
stared at the bit of jewelry with fascinated unbe-
lieving eyes trembling torn between hopes and
fears i pressed a secret spring and the back of the
locket came open tears filled my eyes i felt sud-
denly weak as i gazed like one in a trance at what
was revealed it was impossible utterly incredible
but true within the locket faded and stained was
the portrait of a fair-haired blue-eyed child-the por-
trait of my long lost daughter my baby ruth

whelming truth fearing to trust my senses i sat
there my eyes fixed upon the miniature within the
locket tears coursing down my cheeks until i was
aroused by the kindly priest who laid one hand gently
upon my bowed head

  oh god i groaned can it be true can
merima be my own daughter how can i ever be
sure

     perchance still another miracle has been wrought
said fray benedicto in reverential tones had your
daughter no marks of identification no blemish no
mole nothing by which you could recognize her beyond
all question of a doubt

   for a brief moment i gathered my scattered
senses together and thought deeply then a cry of
joy came from my lips as i remembered

    yes i exclaimed a tiny birthmark like a pink
crescent at the nape of the neck oh-

   but fray benedicto was hurrying from the room
before my sentence was completed

   in a moment he reappeared leading merima by
the hand but not the merima i had known instead
i saw a gloriously beautiful girl whose loveliness was
enhanced rather than diminished by the cheap calico
dress she wore with twinkling eyes and a happy
smile the priest drew her towards me as merima
failing to recognize me at first held back half fear-
fully

    my son give thanks to god that another miracle
has happened cried fray benedicto as he crossed
himself the maiden is your own flesh and blood
your daughter whom none may dispute look for
yourself the mark is there

   sobbing with joy muttering incoherently i clasped
merima in my arms and in broken words of english
spanish and tucumari-strove to tell her that she
was my own long lost daughter she poor child
could not grasp it and thought no doubt i had sud-
denly gone mad but as very patiently fray bene-

dicto related the story of ruths supposed death and
showed her the picture of herself in babyhood within
the locket she at last became convinced but she
could remember nothing of her babyhood of course
nothing of her first few years among the tucumari
and to this day the true story of her salvation of how
she was found and adopted by the indians is but a
vague conjecture it mattered little however that
she was alive and restored to me was enough and
never was there a more joyous party than we three
as we breakfasted on that memorable morning in fray
benedictos home in little santa ysobel

   it was all so wonderful so incredible and as i
looked at merima or rather ruth in her stiff mestizo
dress a great wave of utter joy and contentment
possessed me and i felt that great indeed had been
my reward for all the sufferings and hardships i had
undergone i who had entered the forest penniless
and alone had come forth a croesus with the loveliest
of daughters

  and you actually believe that yarn demanded
walker as belmont came to the end of the story

  most assuredly replied the explorer meredith
had the waupona feather crown he had the emeralds
and the gold and he had his daughter why should
anyone doubt his story

  well id have to be shown declared blake id
like to see such convincing accessories-especially the
girl

  same here agreed thurston

  belmont rose youre all hopeless skeptics he
laughed as he reached for his hat but come over
to my apartments any evening and ill show you the
crown and some of the nuggets and stones and you
can meet meredith hes stopping with me for a time
well ill be hanged ejaculated walker

sides he added as a parting shot id like to intro-

                hopkins cast me a side-long twinkle
 as flocon came into our room at the hotel
 mondain suggestive of a previous conjec-
 ture of his that had struck the truth only
 one who had frequently seen the chief of
 the service de la siireti could have read in his impas-
 sive countenance that at last he had found a pool too
 deep once before i had noted that general darkness
 on his face like a black veil fitted over the marble
 features of a bust so i let fall the lid of my steamer
 trunk it was now quite clear that the four-ten would
 leave without us flocon plumped his fat body down
 upon the trunk and his moustache twitched nervously
 as he addressed elon

   hopkins youve got to help us he began abruptly
 we cant locate the source of the radical propaganda
 that is tying up the country and camproger said a
 week ago that id have to get either action or help i
 guess its the latter

   elons blue eyes twinkled but his features remained
 motionless

   and marie denbaule he queried looking up from
 his pipe

   im coming to that replied flocon smoothly three
 weeks ago the shipbuilders struck at cherbourg and
 two days later the potters at limoges then in rapid
 succession the principal industries at nantes bor-
 deaux and lille rouen rennes angers and tours are
 tied up tighter than a drum but the strange feature
 of the situation is that the workers gave no indica-
 tions of dissatisfaction until this infernally clever propa-
 ganda began to flood the country we have a score of
 local leaders in jail for theyve been waxing positively
 revolutionary but we cant find the focus of infection

camproger thinks its a political plot gaudet has been
absent from the chamber for days at a time on and
off for the last month weve tried to trace his move-
ments but my best men lose him

   he is the leader of the left isnt he asked elon
yes he expected to be the next minister but the
work of the conservatives at the peace convention was
too good to be overlooked and camproger got in since
then gaudet has been strangely quiet and the conserva-
tives had things all their way until these strikes began
in the last three weeks the confidence majority has
shrunk from  to  and camproger told me this
morning that his cabinet will fall in two weeks if we
cant stamp out this propaganda

   it appears obvious flocon interpolated elon eye-
ing the tip of the chiefs nose with aggravating calm-
ness that marie denbaule is doing more good than
all the government forces she seems to exert a tre-
mendous influence upon the people

  she is known for her personal magnetism re-
sponded flocon as if he begrudged the tribute and
no one can deny the qualities of her mezzo yester-
day the steel-workers in nevers went back to a man
after she had sung and spoken to them and she
will not stop despite the threats against her

  you are providing her with ample protection flo-
con queried elon her voice is one in a gener-
ation

  camproger insists upon it since she will not stop
appearing before the strikers he demands that she
be constantly under the eyes of a dozen of my men i
can hardly spare them

   a cold calculating glint came into flocons eyes as
he said this and elon remarked sharply

   denbaules voice is worth a dozen strikes-or jobs
   flocons gaze fell under elons penetrating glare

  yes yes to be sure but she cant be everywhere
at once this morning i had advices that the chemical
workers in dijon had gone
out and all the men from
eight mills in lyons there
may be a general railroad
strike within forty-eight
hours

  the situation is un-
doubtedly grave replied
elon but nevertheless it
seems a matter for cam-
progers internal policy

still if denbaule-

  hopkins this case is
different interrupted flo-
con the workmen are
not really dissatisfied but
are being subjected to
the most insidious propaganda although the syn-
dicalists have gained some power in the last few
years there are still no closely coordinated unions
for the french temperament is too individualistic to
be governed by mass rule but the literature plays
upon the peoples natural misgivings about the eventual
validity of their large holdings of war bonds it paints
vivid pictures of employers excesses and interprets
the present unfavorable rate of exchange in a light
which leads the workers to fear that the francs saved
for old-age retreats will be worthless the people may
soon see their error but at the present rate not
before there is terrible suffering and the ministry has
fallen

  flocon took a deep breath and i wondered whether
he was more interested in the suffering of the people
or in holding his job elon sat staring at the bowl
of his pipe

  what form have the warnings taken flocon the
usual note he inquired suddenly and i knew that he
was thinking more of the danger to marie denbaule
than of bread-lines and riots

  flocon drew out a white envelope elon studied the
exterior for a moment then read the note the snap
came back into his eye the eager spark that i had
not seen there since the mystery of the girondin mur-
der synidcate in which madame de verzou was the
central figure he ran his glass quickly over the writ-
ing looked through the paper at the window then
tossed it to me the note ran in a strong regular
hand

    mue marie denbaule-the people of france
  will not be duped by one who poses as their friend
  the death of an opera singer will be a small mat-
  ter in comparison to the eternal victory of the
  masses without compunction we will still your
  beautiful voice cast the misty fog of death over
  your flashing eyes quiet forever the gestures of
  a sublime actress continue your speaking at
  your peril

                          -the elect of france

   you are right flocon this is a serious case said
elon abruptly ah you should have seen her in
carmen a year ago andrews superb and when she
quelled that riot yesterday in the boul miche-i dont
wonder that these frenchmen go back to work when
she- he glanced quickly from me to flocon as if
ashamed of his unwonted outburst but surely flo-
con it would be a relatively simple matter to time the
appearance of the inflammatory circulars in the various
towns and then trace back the lines of distribution to
their focus

  we have done all that every indication is that
the infection radiates from marseilles but we have

found nothing there al-
though every possible
printing shop has been
turned inside out the pos-
tal authorities have been
examining every suspicious
package but nothing has
resulted

ts gaudet in town
   asked elon

  we traced him to mar-
seilles three days ago
where my men have him
under constant surveil-
ance

  and i noticed by the
papers that marie denbaule left this morning for the
same place observed elon

  yes answered flocon with evident p l m is
growing at that terminus and she is determined to
stop it at all costs strike on that artery would
paralyze the country

  flocon i have never sympathized with the french
government in its political troubles for your system
with its ever-changing ministries reeks of inefficiency
but the circulars which i have seen look like out-and-
out bolshevism and if i can throttle that sinister
influence i shall be serving america as well as france
furthermore this personal danger to marie denbaule
requires immediate action andrews and i will take
the five-twenty for marseilles tonight is valonne still
in charge down there

   yes answered flocon with evident relief

  wire him tonight an accurate account of the exact

 rrlbration our scientists tell vs is life
     f where there is no vibration there can be
     no life on the other hand too much vibra-
     tion as we all know is likely to prove
     disastrous anyone who has been shaken
     back and forth rapidly for a length of time
     will testify to this simple statement this
     fact is well brought out in the present story
     written by a well-known scientist and we
     knovj you will enjoy it
the vibrator of death



  times of first appearance of this inflammatory litera-
  ture in every town that has been affected also as
  nearly as you can a complete record of gaudets
  movements for the past month said elon crisply i
  presume you have been keeping a close watch upon any
  influx from moscow these nation-wide strikes may
  possibly be a result of the bolshevists international
  campaign projected at their recent meeting in bremen
  the late trouble in budapest bears all the marks of
  krampdorffs crafty hand

    krampdorff ejaculated flocon he was reported
  killed in the attempted establishment of the first com-
  mune in berlin ten months ago

    my dear flocon criminal agents should not obtain
  their information from the newspapers replied elon
  smiling coolly the poetic phraseology of this warn-
  ing to marie denbaule reminds me strongly of kramp-
  dorffs literary style especially that peculiar construc-
  tion without compunction at the opening of a threat-
  ening sentence

    but gaudets leadership of the radicals his ab-
  sences his unwonted silence his known designs upon
  camprogers portfolio-conclusions are obvious surely
  hopkins if you will net him as you did owslench a
  year ago the present ministry and i may say i per-
  sonally will owe you a great debt of gratitude he
  added ingratiatingly

    no harm flocon replied elon pleasantly just
  wire valonne the information i mentioned and set
  your best men to find krampdorff valonne can let
  you know the progress made and flocon he con-
  cluded his tone changing to one of incisive command
  if i detect the slightest laxity in your efforts to pro-
  tect marie denbaule i will throw up the case at
  once

    elon and i hastily threw our necessary belongings
  into suitcases checked out at the desk and stepped to
  the curb a man flashed the badge and motioned us
  into a waiting car

    we were soon ensconced in the marseilles express
  elon stretched his lank form diagonally across the
  narrow aisle that separated the white-clothed seats in
  the small compartment and in a moment was puffing
  serenely at the curiously carved pipe without which
  he had never been photographed his long chin sank
  down upon his chest until it touched the little black
  bow while i surveyed the flying landscape my own
  short legs bent at the knee and my feet on the edge
  of the seat before me suddenly he aroused me from
  contemplation of a cluster of little stone cottages

    andrews flocon may not have sufficient imagina-
  tion to become a genuinely astute criminologist but
  he does know psychology did you notice how apparent
  it was that he did not care to detail sufficient men to
  guard denbaule

    he gave the impression that he was short of men
  he has twice as many men as he really needs but
  he was shrewd enough to see that if the popular singer
  should actually be injured on account of her efforts
  to combat the strike propaganda then the people
  would be so enraged against the invisible source of
  agitation that they would voluntarily return en masse
  to their work flocon is clever enough but i think
  i made it clear that i consider human sacrifices to be
  out of date

    he lapsed into silence while i tried to sleep sud-
r denly he remarked

    andrews i dont wonder that these people idolize
  denbaule she will sing tomorrow despite a thousand
  threats for she possesses the dominant spirit with-
  out which the most perfect voice will fail to thrill an
  audience you and i may solve a knotty problem by
  the application of science yet we could not move a

ozen persons i estimate that in her five-year career
denbaule has given her inspiration to  people
but ten days after our cold science resolves this na-
tional crisis nobody will remember anything about it
but these stupid trains-here we are stopped again
they remind me of a game of checkers-not so long
to move but a long time between moves

   i settled myself to doze for i knew from long expe-
rience that elon was not contemplating the fruits
of inspired temperament as seriously as his conversa-
tion might indicate many times i had listened to his
effusions about a thousand apparently unrelated sub-
jects only to hear him suddenly dart out a crisp
sentence which showed that he had been unraveling
a mystery all the time i had often marveled at this
power of abstraction this ability to speak eloquently
while his mind was relentlessly sifting out the essential
from the non-essential and arranging the selected de-
tails in such logical order that i wondered why i
might not have deduced the simple solution of an ap-
parently hopeless tangle of complications i knew
that back in his head he carried a picture of den-
baule with her slim throat and large eyes and that
he would waste no time in solving a case which sur-
rounded her with such personal danger i dozed in-
termittently and as i looked up from time to time i
saw elon examining a pamphlet under his lens or
the written warning to denbaule and twice i was awak-
ened by the rustling of a huge map once i mut-
tered a profane reproach as he pulled me down flat
upon the seat but in a second i understood his action
for a heavy missile crashed through the window cau-
tiously i peeped over the sill and saw a throng of work-
ingmen rioting

  avignon said elon quietly you slept through
a nasty mess at lyons

  from that moment the conductor disregarded the ex-
postulations of fevered passengers who wished to leave
at way-stations and the engineer showed a fine indiffer-
ence to the possibility of torn tracks

  the big station at marseilles was almost deserted
when we alighted at five-thirty in the morning but
elon was in instant conversation with a colorless man
whose head reminded me of a rodent animal elon
introduced him as valonne head of the local branch
of the service as we stood just outside the railings
in the underground train-shed a huge rubber-tired
truck piled high with trunks came bearing noise-
lessly upon us valonne saw it in time to shout a
warning and we jumped aside as it swept past and
plunged through the heavy iron railings elon glanced
quickly in the direction from which it had come but
saw no one and remarked quietly to valonne
apparently you are not the only person who has
received word from paris since we left

alonne shrugged his narrow shoulders and mo-
tioned us into his car there was no disorder
in the streets as we rode swiftly to the hotel des
deux terres the boulevards were deserted except for
small knots of workingmen conversing earnestly yet
one could not fail to be impressed with the diversity
of this picturesque metropolis of the mediterranean
with its massive buildings of white stone facing on
broad boulevards which opened at intervals into in-
congruously narrow and dirty alleys

   ill get the data at your office at eight said elon
as valonne attempted to detain him at the hotel en-
trance now i must sleep

  ten minutes after registering we reposed comfort-
ably in bed i found myself alone upon waking and
my hand rustled against a note on elons vacant
pillow

 rue endemonee

  i read the copy with amazement whom was he
now seeking that he should lure him to a furriers
auction sale at this season why such accurate specifi-
cations of type i read the note again testing whether
our usual code for ephemeral notes would shed light
upon the mystery but reversing the words by threes
made no sense i dressed quickly snatched coffee
and rolls in a caf next door and sought the aue de
meilhan

  the address led me to the old quarter just west of
the main wharves i passed rapidly along an odorifer-
ous street where ear-ringed women sold fresh bread
and stale fish and entered a tiny establishment a
boy was operating a small hand-press and a bent old
man wearing a green eye-shade leaned over the only
type-case in the room he listened attentively while
 explained my wishes and promised to have the job
ready at ten the next morning although he stipulated
a bonus for the rush feature

  i now found myself amidst a mass of speculation
which led me nowhere i wondered whether elon had
already cornered gaudet whether krampdorff was in
marseilles and what red ring might be associated with
him and again i repeated the singular wording of
the advertisement which margulier was setting up
but involuntarily my thoughts came back to condemn
flocon for his half-veiled willingness to allow den-
baule to appear unprotected as champion of order i
caught her name in the two-inch head of a newsboys
paper and found the entire front page of le travail-
icur given over to a raging protest against the pro-
prietor of sunshine park one paragraph was out-
standing in its virulence

  jacobi deserves ruin for against the tide of the peoples
upward rush he arranges a denbaule demonstration and the
popular favorite is a thousand times a traitor in directing her
influence against the masses whose acclamations have raised
her to the pinnacle we earnestly hope that denbaule will
cease her misguided efforts but if she continues the sacrifice
of a superb artist will not be too much to further our cause

  while i was still some distance from the park i saw
a great steel spire towering in the air and knew
that it must be the thriller which had created a sensa-
tion when installed a week previously in the pleasure-
garden modeled after the resorts of new york as
i approached the entrance i saw the lofty shaft begin
to swing slowly through the air and i speculated
upon the probable sensations of the two passengers
who swayed back and forth on the tip of a slender
spire as tall as a three-story building i forced my
way through a dense throng chattering volubly about
the approaching denbaule appearance and found elon
near the south entrance he was watching a group
discharging arrows at a live pigeon tethered by a
one-foot rope to the tip of a fiag-pole at a franc for
five shots

  not such bad shots these frenchmen he remarked
they have had to change the pigeon four times in
the last half- he stopped suddenly as a loud roar
burst from the mob which thronged the grounds ah

 i couldnt stop her

   i followed his gaze to the clubhouse veranda across
 which a small party was making its way towards the
 steps even with my view obstructed by the hats
 which filled all open spaces between amusement booths

 i recognized denbaules loose hair and large eyes the
 crowd gave way to permit the passage of the little
 party while a shrill-voiced barker continued his shout-
 ing

  ride the swaying thriller get the vibration of
a life-time feel the new sensation step right up
and buy your tickets one more ride before denbaule
sings

  the group had now reached the entrance of the
vibrator i recognized valonne at denbaules side
but i had never seen the dapper jew elon whispered
that he was jacobs manager of the resort i caught
a quick exchange of recognition between elon and
denbaule and knew that his morning program had in-
cluded an interview with her she made a striking
figure for she held her slender body erect and her
white shoulders and slim neck shone in sharp relief
above a dark dress over-netted with black lace her
black eyes flashed fearless greeting to the workmen
who pressed about and she smiled gaily but i noticed
dark circles under her eyes and remembered her almost
incessant activity of the past three weeks the party
disappeared into a tall wooden structure which rose
at the side of the towering spire and i turned my
attention to the novel amusement device from which
denbaule was scheduled to sing

   the lofty steel shaft rose vertically to a height of
 fully sixty-five feet above the concrete foundation in
 which it was fixed it was about four feet thick at
 the base and from this width it tapered upwards as
 a slim pyramid the tip of the spire bore a canopied
 structure large enough to hold easily the two chairs
 which were fastened to it one at each side of the pole
 close to the bottom fifteen feet from the ground the
 largest electro-magnet i had ever seen was built into
 a massive foundation the magnet must have weighed
 two tons and i reflected upon the immensity of the
 magnetic force which would be required to deflect the
 huge column and so start its vibrations at the side
 of the shaft stood a tall slender wooden structure con-
 taining an elevator obviously for the purpose of con-
 veying passengers to the platform near the tip of
 the spire

  its a weird contrivance i remarked to elon
spectacular perhaps but how anyone can enjoy-

  andrews you should use your imagination he
interrupted it embodies motion novelty and sudden
change which are at the root of every successful
amusement device when i was a boy i used to sit
perched in the top of a tall lombardy poplar over-
looking the bay and as the wind blew i swayed back
and forth and dreamed of adventures way off beyond
that rolling sea-where we are now andrews jacobs
executed a stroke of vision when he commercialized
this familiar sensation but i cant quite understand
why he risks the popularity of his resort by arrang-
ing this counter-strike demonstration hear that mut-
tering

  an ominous rumble superseded the varied exclama-
tions and i looked up to see the figure of denbaule
standing at ease on the platform high in the air her
huge newfoundland dog stood looking down gravely
over the edge of the platform jacobs stepped to
denbaules side and motioned for silence but the in-
the vibrator of death



censed crowd was in no mood for introductory re-
marks he hesitated but denbaule made an impera-
tive gesture and we saw the gangplank lowered to
form a bridge from the platform to the ledge at the
foot of the chairs on the tip of the spire two at-
tendants strapped denbaule into one of the uphol-
stered chairs and the dog into the other at her back
the gangplank rose and denbaule lifted her ostrich
fan in signal to the operator on the ground i looked
across to the enclosure and saw him close the switch
of the electro-magnet

  involuntarily the crowd burst into cheers as the
free end of the steel tree began to swing slowly
through the air but leaders among them hissed loudly
and the cheering stopped in a few seconds the mag-
net had brought the swaying column to its full ampli-
tude and denbaule rocked back and forth with gentle
rhythm the motion reminded me of a long rope
swing turned upside down to defy the laws of gravity
for denbaule moved at high speed in the center of
the arc and then gradually slowed down until at the
end of each swing she changed direction so gently
that i knew there could be no strain upon the straps
which held her safely in her lofty perch

  suddenly the crowd hushed to listen and the mel-
low tones of the soprano floated down upon a scene
as quiet as the interior of a bank vault instead of
directing her song towards heaven as i had seen her
do on the stage denbaule was now bending forward
as much as the straps would permit and she sang
the prayer from la tosca directly into the upturned
ears of a larger audience than she had ever before
commanded she reached the end of her song held
her gaze steadfast upon the crowd for a full thirty
seconds then spoke

  my poor countrymen are you hungry

  no reply was ventured the tip of the rod swung
back to its other limit returned then denbaule spoke
again

  are your aged parents comfortable

  this time there were a few rough cries no no
as if the leaders had recovered their wits and wished
to break the spell but denbaule continued at the end
of the next swing of the lofty vibrator which thus
seemed to punctuate her simple remarks with dramatic
emphasis

  are your children suffering

  yes came in stronger chorus then one loud oice
shouted we want the money of the parasites we
want-

  then why dont you go back to work and earn it
honestly came the reply smooth and clear yet as
full of feeling as if straight from the heart without
passing through the throat

  the raucous voice attempted to answer but a hun-
dred approving shouts ascended to down out the ob-
jector elon grasped my elbow and pointed to the
tip of the vibrating spire

  see-its speeding up

he dashed off and i saw him struggling furiously to
make way through the crowd the rough work-
ingmen whom he thrust aside mistook him for a protes-
tant against their beloved singer and i saw his prog-
ress impeded by a dozen hands i tried to follow but
the surging mass was  impenetrable before my eyes
the gentle sway of the huge vibrator had become a
jerking shake i could not make out denbaules ex-
pression as she swished back and forth in shorter and
shorter arcs and faster and faster she shrieked
more poignantly than i had ever heard and the dog
at her back howled piteously the crowd stared aghast
at the tragedy taking place before its eyes jacobs

jumped to the front of the platform and called ex-
citedly to the operator on the ground i looked over
to the enclosure and saw that the operator had dis-
appeared

  i struggled fruitlessly to get to the switch but saw
elon finally vault inside the enclosure and shut it off
denbaules cries had ceased and now jets of red
spurted from nose and mouth every time the violent
reversal of motion occurred at the ends of the short
arc in which she swished

  gradually the motion slackened the great shaking
rod came finally to rest and eager attendants lifted the
unconscious girl from her chair even at that dis-
tance i could see that the delicate oval of her face
was streaked with red quickly she was brought down
in the elevator and a doctor from the crowd pro-
nounced her dead

  all was now confusion but the awed exclamations
on every side showed that even in death the beau-
tiful singer had served the cause she fought for and
it was evident that the reaction which flocon had
anticipated would set in by the next morning the
set expression on elons face showed that even he
felt the tragedy deeply

  it was five minutes after we reached our room be-
fore he spoke then his tone was one of bitter self-
reproach

  i should have had valonne lock her up

  but how could anyone foresee such an accident
i exclaimed

  nothing happens without a cause andrews and
when denbaule was so hated in certain quarters-
he paused then lit his pipe and snatched his hat
they have given us something more definite now if
we can only read the signs he even smiled and as
we strode rapidly towards valonnes headquarters he
asked me suddenly

  did you order the dodgers

  margulier promised them for ten tomorrow

  and the type

  ten-point caps bold face

  good but here we are

  he brushed aside formalities

  valonne i understand that professor jules lange-
von invented the swaying thriller and sold it to jacobs
i want you to come with me to see him

  faculty of science elon instructed valonnes
chauffeur and shortly we stopped before one of the
most imposing of the university buildings it was
seven oclock and the halls were quite deserted but
an attendant directed us to the end of a dark corridor

  professor langevon is engaged in research there
he said pointing knock before opening the door for
he is working with very delicate apparatus which must
not be disturbed

  elon knocked impatiently and a gruff response came
quickly

  who is there

  valonne of the secret-service he wishes to con-
sult you in a scientific matter

  you will have to return in the morning replied
the voice all the measurements will be ruined if that
door is opened now

  the matter is very urgent my dear professor i
must beg you to see us at once replied elon
impossible came the curt answer good-bye
elon threw open the door disclosing a scene that
was hardly scientific a woman of about thirty-five
sprang from the lap of a bearded man in dirty labora-
tory robe and the professor rose in unconcealed rage
elon cut short his exlamations

  hopkins is my name this is mr andrews and
this is m valonne with whose name you are undoubt-


amazing stories quarterly

edly familiar you are the inventor of the thriller that
has just killed denbaule and we must insist upon
examining your laboratory

  professor langevon threw up his hands in speech-
less wrath the woman had meanwhile slipped from
the room elon drew his automatic and eyed it con-
templatively and the professor now a more dignified
figure than when startled in his amorous adventure
calmed at once

  you are welcome gentlemen although you are
doubtless aware that your unceremonious entrance into
my private laboratory requires an apology

  we shall appreciate your kindness very much pro-
fessor replied elon ah this is the apparatus with
which you have performed your celebrated researches
on reciprocating motion he exclaimed pointing to a
motor whose driving rod was attached to a small box-
like carriage which stood on two rails

  quite so returned langevon mollified you see
how it operates

  he closed a switch and the carriage ran back and
forth on the rails

  most ingenious professor and now may i have
a large rubber bag filled with water

  certainly responded langevon with evident sur-
prise i noticed one of the boys mending a football
bladder in the workshop will that do

  elon nodded assent and langevon returned in a
moment with the oval bag filled with water elon
hung it freely in the center of the carriage then
started the motor and gradually advanced the control
the carriage oscillated to and fro with increasing
speed so that the bag swung against one end of the
carriage and then the other water squirted from
the valve at each bump as the oscillations became
more rapid the force of the bumps increased and
finally the bag burst elons eye lit but he said only
a striking demonstration of inertia professor a
thousand thanks for your kindness

  you saw what would happen to a human heart
he asked as we were again in our room

  you mean the experiment with the rubber bag
exactly as soon as the speed of the thriller
reached a certain limit the changes of direction at the
ends of the swings were so sudden that denbaules
heart was bumped forcibly against the walls of the
thoracic cavity and finally the valves burst you
recall the spurts of blood

  i saw it all in a flash but he was speaking again
now we know that the effect of vibrating too rap-
idly could easily be predicted here is the next step
he had erected a thin rod of spring steel vertically
upon a wooden base he connected a dry cell to an
electro-magnet at the bottom and the rod swayed
back and forth it was in fact a miniature swaying
thriller occasionally he changed the position of a
sliding weight which he had clamped to the rod and
took observations with a stop-watch i observed that
the nearer the weight was to the tip the more slowly
the rod vibrated but while i was trying to draw
some connection he rose quickly

  and now to examine the shaft

  the park lay in complete darkness when we reached
it but nevertheless elon maneuvered cautiously before
scaling a fence near the looming spire he took a coil
of insulated wire from his grip quickly climbed a
pole and connected the wires to the two power lines
which fed the park he brought the loose ends to
ground attached two rods then in a trice was ascend-
ing the narrow ladder attached to the steel column
at intervals he tapped cautiously with a hammer then
i saw a blinding flash as he touched the rods together
against the side of the shaft i knew that he was

melting a hole through the steel with his electric
arc and platinum electrodes which had been of such
service in the fulton bank case he withdrew the
electrodes inserted calipers and called

   centimeters take it down

  he made measurements at intervals of six feet
while i tabulated the figures that he gave me he
returned quickly to the ground after the last measure-
ment disconnected the wires packed his tools and re-
turned to the hotel where he plunged into calculations
which covered sheet after sheet i watched for a few
minutes interested in the curious symbols but finally
threw myself upon the bed

it was nine in the morning when i awoke but the
electric lights were still burning brightly and the
carpet was covered with a deep layer of penciled papers
elon bent over the table a cup of black coffee at his
elbow i heard him murmur

   too low too low-but theres nothing else
you snored fearfully he exclaimed looking to-
wards me get those dodgers this morning and meet
me for dinner at the palais crystal at six-thirty

  he jammed his hat on his head and strode out
leaving me to speculate upon the significance of the
figure  margulier had the dodgers ready promptly
at ten and as i returned to the hotel i heard news-
boys crying the tragedy one paragraph especially in-
terested me

   government engineers testified that such a shaft can vi-
brate at only one speed which is determined entirely by its
rigidity and distribution of weight and they set up apparatus
which showed that the only effect of the magnet is to main-
tain the natural rate of the rod their testimony proved that
the accident was due to crystallization of the steel under the
enormous stresses involved examination of the shaft this
morning revealed a scries of small holes apparently made with
a welding torch but these were held to have had no effect
the manager of the park mr jacobs as well as the inventor
prof j langevon were completely exonerated and the shaft
is being strengthened for an early re-opening

  elon was taciturn at supper merely stating that
we would have an interesting expedition during the
evening and i wondered whether after all there was
any connection between denbaules death and the
venomous propaganda we smoked leisurely until nine
watching the colorful diners seated under the glass
canopy of the sidewalk cafe then valonne called with
two of his men and the five of us motored out the
road that skirted the bay elon watched the shore
closely and halted us in a cluster of trees about four
miles from town

  half an hour later a heavy truck stopped directly
opposite our hiding place four men alighted and
dragged two cylinders to the water-front the moon-
light shone upon them as they attached a long hose
to the nozzle of each tank then we heard the muffled
wheezing of pressure suddenly released the breeze
brought a pungent odor to our nostrils and elon
whispered laconically

  chlorine

  presently he pressed the key of a small wireless
sender in the automobile and almost immediately a
lighted launch moved closer to shore the four men
stopped work with sharp ejaculations of disappoint-
ment hastily re-loaded the cylinders and turned the
truck towards town we trailed them at a safe dis-
tance

  the lumbering truck led us straight to sunshine
park elon cautiously followed them towards the club-
house then motioned us to come on he led us into
what seemed to be an employees entrance and halted
beside a sink in a basement lavatory stooping he
the vibrator of death



fingered among the pipes leading down from the sink
then in the semi-gloom we saw a small door swing in-
wards elon wriggled through the narrow opening
and we followed him down the large corridor into
which we had emerged he held up a hand in warn-
ing then darted at full speed around the corner

  four men jumped as if shot only to face five leveled
revolvers elon advanced quickly and handcuffed the
four two by two

  i think this is all of them valonne remarked
elon with a smile of satisfaction but your men
might guard that entrance

  i looked again at the four men who stood against
the wall one i recognized immediately as jacobs
manager of the resort manacled to him was an im-
mensely tall and emaciated man clad in a dignified
black frock coat his singularly bearded and massive
head towered above the cringing jew at his side the
other men were garbed as workers with bare forearms
and dirty hands their faces revealed merely the
stolid indifference of stupidity

  elon walked quickly to the single typecase that stood
between two hand-presses and fitted every letter from
one of the compartments into a printers type-assembler
he mounted the type in a form ran off a proof and
examined it eagerly under his glass

  valonne the case is now complete he remarked
quietly you may arrest jacobs krampdorff and
their  two helpers as murderers and revolutionary
plotters

  its a lie shouted jacobs his face blanched and
knees sagging but krampdorff said coolly

  my dear professor hopkins perhaps you will tell
us by what right you enter our private workroom and
address us as murderers surely you realize that you
have no evidence to substantiate such charges

  the french government may use its own discre-
tion about the revolutionary literature with which these
racks are filled said elon grimly snatching one of
the folders from a shelf but as for myself i shall
enjoy seeing you electrocuted for the murder of marie
denbaule

  he turned quickly to valonne

  i owe you some explanation my dear valonne i
will trace the evidence briefly i had no sooner come
to marseilles than i noticed the dodgers which jacobs
had issued to advertise sunshine park and i observed
the same peculiarly ragged scratch across the face
of one capital e that i had seen in the revolutionary
dodgers you are aware of course that under the
microscope such minute scratches are as distinctive
as the finger-print of criminals

  naturally this aroused my suspicion valonne but
you informed me that the printer whose name ap-
peared at the bottom of the amusement dodgers had
just been raided without result the obvious conclu-
sion was that the printer of the amusement dodgers
was using marguilers name as a blind in order to
test this point i had dodgers overloaded with es
printed at marguliers shop

  he exhibited one of the furrier dodgers

  you will note valonne the preponderance of es
in average copy the percentage of es is slightly under
 so i judged that  per cent almost  in every  let-
ters would exhaust his small stock of type and thus

the microscope reveals no evidence of it

  this was sufficient to center suspicion upon sun-
shine park but in the meantime the murder had oc-
curred a simple experiment proved that a skillful
scientist could easily predict the physiological effect of
vibrating too rapidly it is well known that the rate
of vibration of a rigid shaft depends only upon its
rigidity and distribution of weight i found by a
mathematical investigation that  pounds of ma-
terial must be removed from the upper part of the
shaft in order to increase its rate from  to 
vibrations per minute which were the values i had
noted at the park and the double fact that the acceler-
ation had occurred gradually and in public indicated
that this material must have flowed down from the in-
terior of the shaft after being released by a timed
valve i found that the upper half of the shaft con-
tained a hollow space of  cubic feet and by simple
division i ascertained that the material removed must
have weighed  pounds to the cubic foot in other
words its density with  there is no liquid possess-
ing exactly this density but mercury commonly known
as quicksilver has a density of  and i concluded
that perhaps the hollow space had not been truly
conical as i had assumed in my calculations

  the simplest method of removing this mercury
while thousands were looking was to allow it to run
into the sewer so i expected to find it at the outlet
of that particular trunk fifty feet west of pointe
cochon it was quite clear that we were dealing with
criminals of the highest intellectual calibre so i antici-
pated an effort to remove the mercury from the little
depression on the bottom of the bay at the sewers
mouth where the metallic fluid must remain on ac-
count of its density you know the remaining details
valonne our auxiliary on the launch interrupted the
chemical experiment of these worthies which con-
sisted simply in pumping compressed chlorine gas into
the pool of mercury the mercuric chloride formed by
chemical reaction would dissolve in the surrounding
water thus your men will find some mercury left as
evidence and perhaps some dead fish also floating
upon the surface of the water for mercuric chloride
dissolved in water is a deadly poison

e second swarm

by j schlossel

he sun had just sunk behind the hills in the
west along the atlantic seaboard of north
america when into the upper reaches of the
earths atmosphere from the southeast not
far from the spot in the horizon where
presently sirius in all of its splendor would rise there
suddenly shot a long slender meteor-like object it
sped through the highly rarefied outermost stratum of
air with such speed that it glowed red in an instant
it did not follow the usual path of a shooting star
but seemed to rise holding a course near the top of
the ocean of air which must have been parallel with
the curvature of the earth it sped northwest like
a blood-red streak it was traveling across the darken-
ing sky from the spot in the heavens where the first
had made its sudden appearance five more meteor-like
objects in a straight row equally distanced from each
other plunged into our gaseous envelope glowed red
as blood and followed the course of the first behind
them came a row of five more then five more stead-
ily and silently they came into view row after row
their silent passage was ominous

  as if by a signal a myriad ships of air of every
conceivable shape and size shot up into the air from
the surface of the water along the atlantic shore
ready to leap into the air almost immediately they
were joined by thousands from the land straight
up they rose with astonishing swiftness mighty tele-
scopes in huge observatories at various elevated points
of the earth had picked
out and counted them-
one hundred and one in
all-and studied them as
they drew near long
before those meteor-like
objects had become visible
to the naked eye their
formation and their
course marked them
plainly for what they
were from the count-
less ships of air as they
rose to meet the strange
visitors there broke
forth a roar of artillery
which grew in volume
and fury as their dis-
tance from the meteor-
like objects lessened

  the myriad ships that
had leapt up from the
surface of both land and
water were left behind

before they had risen more than a few miles in the air
the meteor-like objects-mile-long interstellar ships-
gradually slackening their speed continued to hurtle
in a northwesterly direction the red glow that en-
veloped each as it shot into the highly rarefied upper
stratum of air was fading as their speed dropped
still further but even yet mere earthly distances
were being wiped out with amazing swiftness at the
terrific velocity with which they were still traveling

 or sheer daring and power of imagina-
 tion the second swarm will remain for
 years to come a great outstanding work
 in scientifiction

   an interplanetary story such as this has
 never before been imagined it is true
 that other stories have carried vs to other
 planets and even to other universes but
 never before has any author pictured them
 with such daring and such depth of imag-
 ination as this

   we consider it one of the greatest in-
 terplanetary stories that has come along in
 years and we know it will be accepted by
 you as such

populated city which was partially hidden from view
by some heavy low-flying clouds pale-yellow beams
made their appearance pointing upwards from the top-
most pinnacles of its highest towers the upward
progress of those beams seemed to be visibly retarded
by the air a powerful sucking sound could be heard
in the neighborhood of those high towers around
each of the beams a miniature whirlwind was begin-
ning to revolve slowly the air became golden and
hazy the powerful sucking sound became a roar of
rushing wind the heart of the city around the
towers seemed to be in the grip of a tornado of
the heavy clouds only some tiny feathery specks re-
mained one by one the pale-yellow beams were shut
off and the wind began to die down

  the interstellar ships were almost at the edge of
the outskirts of the city now the first the one in
the lead shot across the heart of the city suddenly
from some of the lower towers there darted heaven-
wards twin beams of curiously scintillating green
rays those green rays seemed far from dangerous
yet they feared them and gave all large cities a wide
berth after this

  as those mighty interstellar ships shot across the
first series of mountain ranges colossal guns thundered
from below mans forces of destruction were being
loosened in all their fury from far in the northwest
toward which the interstellar ships were heading
there began to rise thousands upon thousands wave

                          upon wave of ships of
air belching flame and
metal in a terrific effort
to bar their progress as
the interstellar ships
drew near but neither
the ships of air nor
their projectiles could
reach the high altitude
at which the others were
traveling

  the twenty rows of in-
terstellar ships with
their leader far in front
paying little attention to
the thousands of ships
that were trying to stop
them passed swiftly on
the thousands of terres-
trial ships turned in
swift pursuit but the
interstellar ships were
traveling too high and
too fast for them
though they were left behind from every valley and
plain the earthly ships rose in their thousands with the
guns roaring and followed doggedly there seemed
to be no end of them they rose in tireless waves
until they passed the fifty-fifth degree latitude north
above that latitude they ceased to rise

  the gap between the first row of those ships of air
and the last row of interstellar ships began to increase
rapidly the interstellar ships were now flying parallel
with the rocky mountains suddenly mammoth pieces

of artillery on the mountain plateaus and snow-covered
peaks in their path began to thunder madly each
mile over which they were passing was being con-
tested fiercely desperately yet it had no visible effect
upon the interstellar ships that had plunged into the
earths atmosphere from out of the depths of space
and followed their course against all opposition of man
in a way mans efforts to stop them seemed like some
futile attempts of hordes of tiny ants

  as the countless ships of air neared the forlorn
wastes of the arctic circle they began to wheel
around and speed back it appeared as if they
dared go no further as if the snow-covered wastes
above the arctic circle were in alien hands

  the mighty interstellar ships moving along at only
a fraction of the velocity with which they had first
entered the topmost layer of the atmosphere of earth
continued on their course until they neared a region
where many hundred interstellar ships patterned
exactly after the hundred and one in the air lay
sunken in the snow in rows of ten

  holding an even keel the interstellar ships began
to drop down from their great elevation until they
were only one thousand feet above the surface then
slowly cruised along as if searching for a suitable
place to land a few miles from the shores of the
arctic ocean a number of shallow depressions upon
the ground came into view they began to settle into
them one by one

  as soon as they had eased themselves snugly down
long metal gangways were run out and men heavily
clad and with packs upon their backs and weapons
in their hands began to pour forth from each ship

  the men moved around their respective ships for a
while then formed themselves into orderly ranks and
marched swiftly along the roads of snow to the square
openings which led underground they carried their
large packs easily their bearing and the way they
held their weapons bespoke long training yet they
were all very young hardly out of their teens

  among them there rose a faint murmur of discon-
tent they were growing tired of these everlasting
practice trips and longed for some real action some-
thing with real danger they knew how to handle
the ships perfectly now and they hated this per-
petual training that was making mere automatons of
them all some who could see no reason for com-
plaint were saying they would soon get action plenty
of it when the appointed day finally dawned but
meanwhile it was exciting enough plunging out of
the depths of space from far beyond the orbit of
neptune at a terrific velocity circling the four dead
moons of uranus and dropping many tons of powerful
explosives and deadly gas-forming chemicals upon their
barren surfaces as if attacking veering sharply as
they approached too close to the neighborhood of
saturn-that wondrous ringed planet with its family
of moons-a miniature solar system in itself-and
sending from each ship a stream of missiles contain-
ing explosives of an atomic nature at the tiny moon-
lets which composed the rings causing them to dis-
rupt their equilibrium and crash into each other dodg-
ing the asteroids fragments of an exploded planet
which once had its orbit between that of mars and
mighty jupiter and which now occupied an entire
region

this was the year  of the new era the
year preceding that which the inhabitants of
earth had been looking forward to for nearly a thou-
sand years at the beginning of the next year the
second great expedition was to be launched into

the infinity of space to pass beyond the orbit of nep-
tune even now everything was ready only waiting
the word to go the men and women who were going
were trained until they could be trained no more the
ships were built and ready supplies were now being
stowed into those ships

  sirius the brightest star in the heavens viewed
from the surface of the earth rose slowly in the east
men and women began to point it out to each other as
it rose above the horizon and nodded to each other as
their lips framed the word-soon ever since it
was ascertained-at a terrible cost to human life-
that around that bright star there revolved a planet
capable of sustaining life such as exists on earth man
has gazed covetously up at it as he prepared for a
certain day in the future-the second day of the com-
ing year-when the forces of man would leave earth
in i mighty swarm to add yet another world to his
slowly expanding domain

  when the second great expedition was first planned
following the complete success of the first which had
gone toward alpha centauri and now occupied two
of the nineteen planets which revolved around that
star scouting expeditions were sent out to seven of the
nearer stars to investigate they realized that the dis-
tance of twenty-five light years from the solar system
would be the absolute limit to which any expedition
could be sent at the present day with any hope of suc-
cess the nearer the star of course the greater the
chances of success in the event that the selected planet
was inhabited and the inhabitants resented the in-
vasion of man

  blue-white vega toward which the solar system was
hurtling at the rate of one million miles a day and
the giant orange-hued arcturus in the constellation of
bootes were believed to be just at the extreme limit
then came white-hot formalhaut in piscis australis
at the distance of twenty-three light years from the
solar system next in distance was altair in aquila at
sixteen light years from earth procyon in canis
minor was accredited with the distance of twelve light
years sirius in canis major at the distance of nine
light years and  cygni the sixth magnitude star
in the constellation of sygnus at the distance of eight
and a half light years are the three nearest of the
seven

  a scouting expedition of two interstellar ships was
considered enough to send to each of the seven selected
stars six interstellar ships capable of making a round
trip to any distance up to thirty light years from the
solar system were planned and built a driving mech-
anism producing rays powerful enough to hurtle them
along at two-thirds the speed of light through the
utter void of space between the stars was installed in
each of them the three farthest stars of the seven
was their destination they left the earth in the order
of the distance they had to travel so that they would
all return around the same period

  two more interstellar ships were completed and
twenty-one years later they left for altair in the con-
stellation of aquila twelve years elapsed before the
expedition for procyon in canis minor was on its
way the expedition for sirius started nine years
later the last of the seven scouting expeditions was
toward  cygni in cygnus which started a year and
a half later

  each of the four scouting expeditions that had gone
toward arcturus vega formalhaut and altair had
three separate complete crews who worked their ships
in rotation each of the crews operated their ships
for a period of years while one of the crews worked
the ship the other two were sunk in a lethargic state
the second swarm



which resembled suspended animation the lethargic
state was induced by drugs and conserved life-held
life in abeyance the expeditions whose destinations
had been toward procyon  cygni and sirius had but
two sets of complete crews each

   the first of the scouts to return were the two ships
that had gone toward  cygni in cygnus their re-
port was that only one tiny dark body or planet re-
volved around that star at a distance of near three
billion miles and that it had a surface temperature of
only a few degrees above absolute zero it would never
be able to support life of any kind

  the next to return was the expedition that had gone
toward procyon in canis minor their report was that
around that yellow star besides the faintly luminous
companion of sunlike dimensions which could be made
out from earth there revolved eleven planets three of
which were accompanied by satellites from the stand-
point of life such as exists on earth all except one
of the eleven had orbits which were either too close
or too far from that luminary the planet whose orbit
was situated at the best distance for both heat and
light also had a dense gaseous envelope or atmos-
phere seen from the distance of a few million miles
it appeared to be just the world that man was seek-
ing as the goal of the second great expedition but
on landing it was found to lack one of the chief es-
sentials necessary for the support of life-such as
exists upon the surface of the world where man orig-
inated-oxygen in the atmosphere

  exactly at forty-eight hours of each other the ex-
peditions that had gone toward vega and formalhaut
were sighted but before they hove into view it was
known that their quest for a world revolving around
those two stars toward which the proposed second
great expedition could start was equally fruitless
the two ships that had gone vegaward were the first
to return to the surface of earth they found that
vega had a family of seven large primary planets still
in a gaseous stage the smallest of which was much
larger than our own mighty jupiter and each was at-
tended by numerous satellites whose size ranged from
one hundred miles in diameter to a few with a diameter
of five thousand miles water could not exist in its
liquid state on any of those satellites because the heat
they received from their primaries and from vega was
too great

  around formalhaut too were many planets but the
one which approached nearest in its resemblance to the
earth was still in an early evolutionary state that fol-
lowed close upon the formation of a crust over a molten
interior-the eruptive stage around those two stars
there was no place for man-as yet

  the scouting expeditions that had gone toward arc-
turus in the constellation of bootes altair in aquila
and sirius in canis major were still to be heard of

a year and nine months after the expeditions from
vega and formalhaut had returned a message
came to earth from a small slow-moving interstellar
hip cruising near neptune that a battered inter-
stellar ship-one of the mile-long ships built for long
distance travel-had been seen hurtling past neptune
on its way toward earth at its greatest velocity and
then suddenly had begun to act strangely with di-
minishing speed it was swerving hither and thither as
if no one were guiding it

  large interstellar ships were dispatched from earth
to investigate they came upon that battered inter-
stellar ship between the orbits of uranus and saturn
those who were on the lookout on the ships seeking it
were the first to see that the whole forward end was

riddled with large gaping holes it was taken in tow
and brought to earth

  when it was forced open they found that not one
human being of all three complete crews was alive in-
side that battered ship most of them had met in-
stant death out there in the depths of space near al-
tair when the ship was struck a few had managed
to survive the shock and had barricaded themselves in
the air-tight chambers which housed the driving ap-
paratus and guiding mechanism

  there were hardly enough left to work the ship yet
it had to come back for it was certain death to delay
an attempt to repair the damage at the forward end
of the ship

  disregarding whatever might lie in their path they
drove the ship back at full speed a thousand times
they missed utter destruction by a hairs breadth be-
fore the accident the machinery had run smoothly and
automatically now the few survivors had to watch and
repair it almost continuously to keep it from shaking
itself apart

  though the task would have been too much for even
three times their number they stuck it out for more
than half the journey back but flesh and blood can
stand only so much and one by one they began to drop
from the ranks of the living the ship had to return
to earth with its warning of what revolved around that
star toward which it had been sent the shrinking
band of survivors drove themselves on and on they
watched their shipmates die one by one more than
once did they wish that they had met death quickly
when the ship had first been struck the last of the
crew dropped dead as the ship crossed the orbit of
neptune

  of the two interstellar ships that had gone toward
altair in aquila only one with its freight of dead re-
turned the other had met in headlong collision with
a small dark body about one hundred feet in diameter
hurtling through space and was destroyed instantly
the second ship had nearly met a like fate the only
thing that saved them was the warning of the fate of
the first all that they had been able to find was that
numerous dense swarms of planetoids whose individual
diameters ranged from only a few feet to many miles
revolved around altair

  the expeditions that had gone toward arcturus and
sirius were yet to be heard from great anxiety was
felt for their safety four years dragged by after the
battered ship of the ill-fated expedition to altair had
returned and still there was no sign of them they
were given up for lost as the fifth year was drawing
to a close the scouting expedition that had gone to-
ward the giant orange-hued arcturus in bootes re-
turned with the information that at the distance of
twenty-five light years from the solar system the
absolute limit set arcturus was still many light years
away fearing that their provisions would not hold
out they did not even attempt to reach it

  the two ships that had gone toward sirius in canis
major were yet to be heard from years followed rap-
idly one after the other until a score had passed and
still no sign of that expedition the belief that some
accident had befallen it had crystallized into a cer-
tainty an expedition of ten mighty interstellar ships
started out toward sirius to learn the fate of the
others

  twenty-eight years later one of the ten ships that
had gone toward sirius to investigate the disappear-
ance of the first two came hurtling back to earth as
if it had had all the legions of the universe at its
heels glowing blood-red it shot through the atmos-
phere into the waters of the atlantic ocean near one

of the largest cities of north america and disap-
peared underneath the surface it rose to the surface
and came within a mile of the shore where its keel
grated upon the bottom and there it came to a dead
stop

  a number of ships of air hovering near made for it
at once a door was slid half open in the side of the
interstellar ship and the form of a man swaddled from
head to foot in what looked like dirty rags appeared
for a moment in the opening seeing the ships of air
drawing near he made motions with his hands for
them to keep away they seemed to pay no attention to
his signs and continued to draw near from the shore
thousands of men and women were putting off toward
the ship in every kind of available craft the man
standing in the half-open doorway of the interstellar
ship moved back out of sight and snapped the door
shut with a clang a moment later there came a wire-
less warning to keep away from the ship because
those who were left of the crew were in the grip of
some loathsome disease which they had contracted
upon the surface of the only habitable world that
circled sirius

  a number of men of science and physicians were
ordered to board the ship to study the disease of-
ficers from the department of public health were
ordered to form a cordon around the plague ship with
their airships until the physicians and scientists with
their supplies had boarded the stricken vessel then it
was to be taken in tow to a lonely spot on the at-
lantic coast and beached no one was allowed to ap-
proach it under the penalty of being placed in quaran-
tine aboard the interstellar ship until the disease germs
were isolated and conquered

  this disease was of an exceedingly virulent nature
it attacked every living thing which was brought
aboard for experimental purposes no creature cold-
or warm-blooded was immune once contracted it ran
its usual course ending in death in some cases the
disease lasted for a few months and in other cases
it took many years to kill

  the disease was totally unknown to man the phys-
icians could do nothing for the remnant of the crew
still surviving they could only look on and make their
sick as comfortable as possible in some respects the
disease resembled leprosy as it neared its final stage
lumps of flesh rotted and fell from the living frame

  the physicians and scientists worked feverishly
months went by and they seemed to make no progress
the crew were the first to go then the physicians
succumbed not until nearly all of the physicians and
scientists who had boarded the ship-they had all con-
tracted the disease within the first forty-eight hours-
had died from it after years of tireless research was
the disease finally arrested and finally conquered by
means of an antitoxin

the story that the crew gave out to the world was
this when the ten mighty interstellar ships drew
near sirius they slackened their speed a little until
they neared the outermost planet revolving around that
bright star from a great height they circled it its
atmosphere was hardly worthy of note man could
not live upon that world not unless he brought his
air with him the next three planets in order to sirius
were also unfit for human habitation for various rea-
sons there was something familiar about the fifth
outermost planet it had a ring around it that re-
sembled saturns composed of myriads of tiny moon-
lets that fifth outermost planet also had an exten-
sive atmosphere

  the ships drew swiftly near that world it had the

appearance of a wondrous jewel worthy of all hard-
ships from the angle at which they were approach-
ing the ring looked like two handles by which the
sirian world could be grasped the moonlets which
composed that ring ranged from a few hundred feet
in diameter to about five miles the larger masses of
that ring were nearly all globular

  hazy patches which later became more distinct and
were seen to be great bodies of water and land seas
and continents could be made out on the surface
drawing nearer light and darker areas barren tracts
and regions covered with vegetation stood out wind-
ing rivers and lakes could also be seen still nearer
large cities in the midst of the darker areas and at
the shores of the seas came into view

  one after the other at the intervals of a minute
or so the ten interstellar ships shot into its atmosphere
the friction of their passage through the most rare-
fied part of the gaseous envelope caused them to glow
red almost as soon as they entered the atmosphere
thousands of tiny ships of air leapt up from the sur-
face of both land and water in an effort to attack
the ten ships that had come from out of the void but
they were traveling too high and too fast from each
of the tiny ships of air there came bright flashes as if
they were discharging weapons which resembled the
ancient artillery of man

  crossing high over one of the cities in their path
the first interstellar ship in the lead dropped a little
lower to see what manner-of intelligent creatures built
and inhabited it the city it was seen was composed
of huge masses of masonry in its center were a few
masses larger than the rest and as the ship drew near
those larger masses of masonry a strange beam of a
dozen different blending hues leapt up and touched it
though it was traveling at a high velocity the ship
came to a stop as if it had struck a slightly yielding
but impenetrable barrier it could neither go forward
nor draw back for a moment it hung motionless and
then began to drop slowly down as if it were being
pulled by some powerful magnetic force

  the interstellar ship with its driving rays that were
powerful enough to hurtle it along at two-thirds the
speed of light turned on full tried to rise to break
away from the force that was drawing it down to the
surface of that world but it could not there was an
uncanny resemblance to a fly being caught securely
in the sticky strands of a spiders web lower it was
drawn and still lower the other nine ships could do
nothing from other parts of the city there gleamed
forth the same strange beams of blending light and
the nine interstellar ships swerved from their course

  those aboard this ship began to realize their danger
their driving rays could not free them they were
very near the tops of the masses of masonry which
composed the city they got a confused view of the
inhabitants creatures nearly all arms and legs scramb-
ling away from the danger zone hardly a mile above
the mass of masonry from which the beam came the
officers in command of that ship ordered a few of the
largest bombs to be dropped there was a roar and
the mass of masonry directly underneath the ship was
blown to bits

  the force which had been drawing the interstellar
ship down disappeared with the destruction of the
structure it started to rise but it did not get far
for it was instantly set upon by thousands of ships
which clung to its surface like iron filings on a mag-
net their weight drew it low again near the center
of the city there was a large cleared space and the
strangers who clung to the interstellar ship were
trying to draw it down to that spot before it reached
the second swarm



a door was slid half open in the side of the interstellar ship and   
a man appeared in the opening seeing tho ships of air drawing
near he made motions with his hands for them to keep away
they seemed to pay no attention to his signs and continued to
draw near from the shore thousands of men and women were
putting off toward the ship in every kind of available craft

the ground there was a mighty explosion and a great
flare of blinding light and a dense cloud of smoke and
dust rose high in the air the interstellar ship and
the small ships of air that clung to it were destroyed
there was no sign of the city except a deep hole in
the ground where the city stood whether the ex-
plosion came from the interstellar ship or from the
ships of that world it was impossible to say

  the nine remaining interstellar ships as they con-
tinued on their course around the new world gave all
cities a wide berth after that for the fate of their
sister ship made them keep a sharp lookout they
traveled as fast and as high as possible whenever they
saw any beams of light point heavenwards they swerved
from their course

the intelligent inhabitants of the sirian world
seemed amply prepared against invaders their
weapons and the relentlessness with which they at-
tacked the nine interstellar ships were beginning to
worry the leaders they were allowed no respite

  crossing over some low mountain ranges guns roared
forth from below a few of the projectiles striking
lightly on the bottom of the ships there were other
ships on a sea also armed with great guns and they
kept up a steady firing as long as they could near-
ing a fertile plain thousands of tiny ships of air rose
to bar their progress everything that moved anything
that had any height carried weapons and used them
in an effort to destroy the ships from our mother
earth

  half way around that planet the visitors came to a
desert in the middle of which were two mighty inter-
stellar ships such as the scouting expedition which had
left the earth for sirius long before that explained
everything to the commanders of the ships from earth
that was the reason for the satellites preparedness
the interstellar ships all except one which was ordered
to cruise about and keep watch for any suspicious
signs dropped to the surface near the two ships to
learn whose fate they had come all the way from the
solar system

  the inhabitants of the strange world guessed rightly
that the ten interstellar ships had not come just for
the pleasure of it that world was so well prepared for
defense that they must have been expecting them had
they been watching the approach of the interstellar
ships as they came within the glare of their sun
hardly the ships traveled so swiftly that it was al-
most impossible to see them then again they could
not possibly have prepared themselves so well in so
short a space of time

  the region seemed utterly deserted there was no
sign of man nothing moved near the two ships it
did not look as if any of the creatures of the new
found world had ever neared it one broken and
twisted as if it had been dealt a terrific blow was
lying on its side the other rested right side up as if
it had come down with some one still at the controls

  in the form of a ring the eight ships slowly settled
around the two wrecks at the least sign of anything
suspicious they were ready to shoot up into the

tested and found fit to breathe from each of the eight
ships a number of the crew and inmates armed to the
teeth came forth to investigate the two interstellar
ships that had many years ago carried the scouting
expedition to sirius they approached warily sud-
denly the wide doors on the ship which was lying
right side up opened and fan-shaped streams of all-
devouring flame swept over the men destroying them
all before they could even threw themselves flat upon
their faces

  the men aboard the interstellar ships who were on
guard gave warning and the eight ships began to rise
in an instant the whole region became alive square
masses of masonry rose jerkily from below the surface
they covered the whole region for miles near the two
stranded interstellar ships and from the rising masses
of masonry the mouths of guns could be seen bom-
barding the eight interstellar ships destroying them
one by one before they could rise more than their own
length the interstellar ship which was cruising about
high in the heavens took alarm and started to speed
away a great gun stuck its mouth up from below the
surface and poured a silent stream of projectiles to-
ward the speeding ship a few of the missiles pene-
trated into the chambers where the crew were they
were hollow containing a vapor-like substance under
pressure which was rushing forth steadily from a
number of minute holes men grabbed the missiles
and threw them into tanks containing water the ship
was out of range before any great damage was done

  a year after the ship left the ringed world which
circled sirius a terrible disease broke out among the
operating crew the disease-germs were traced to the
projectiles which had been fired into the ship as it
sped away from the attack all on board were in-
fected and they began to succumb one by one the
reserve crew were at last awakened from their state
of suspended animation and took over the duties of the
ship they too contracted the disease at last the
ship reached the earth

  years passed the second great expedition also a
terrible punitive expedition now had a goal in view
preparations of the expedition down to the most min-
ute detail were completed the creatures who lived on
the satellite which circled about sirius would be sorry
they ever attacked man

  had those intelligent creatures who inhabited the
ringed world of sirius not attacked and destroyed the
two expeditions from earth man on discovering that
it was in sole possession of highly intelligent creatures
would not have dreamt of invading it but now   

the beginning of the following year the expedition
would start a few more months and the day
would dawn the men and women who were to go
were given a final round of training and then sent
home to spend the remaining days with their families
the months dwindled down to one month the one
month to a week the week to one day more-tomorrow

  it was impossible for sleep to come to any one on
this particular night for the night was being kept
vibrantly awake by the incessant hum of countless
voices like that of angry bees that rose and fell upon
the chill night air it came from the great dwellings
light streaming from each window that towered up
and up into the night until they seemed to merge as
one with the star-flecked sky overhead huge piles of
steel and masonry that housed on the average of five
thousand families to the building it came from the
many different street levels and wide recreation squares
that were swiftly becoming crowded with people mostly
young it came from the very air overhead through

which youth was flashing on the wing it was every-
where a throbbing murmur of mingled weeping and
laughter in which laughter was slowly becoming more
and more pronounced

  on this night as on that other memorial night many
millions of families were experiencing the sharp pangs
of parting with their loved ones who were leaving upon
a great adventure they would most likely not return
for those who were going as always the thrill for
those who were to remain the heartache in nearly
each and every apartment of those who were going
there were real tears and forced laughter and wishes
of good luck some mothers tried bravely to hide their
real feelings but their laughter plainly forced jarred
on their nerves others wept bitterly and yet clung
harder to those who were leaving

  all over the earth it was the same east or west
south or north the members of the second great ex-
pedition were taking their last leave of their parents
of their brother and sisters and friends who were
either too old or too young or physically unfit to ac-
company them on this stupendous adventure which
was being launched into that boundless void of space
out beyond the bounds of the solar system keep-
sakes locks of hair and every imaginable remedy for
pains and wounds were being thrust upon them from
all sides and steadfastly refused as they personally
packed their slender kits only pictures of those whom
they would probably never see again in flesh were be-
ing reverently placed away

  all this activity was like that of a busy hive of over-
crowded bees preparing to swarm

  the order had gone forth that every one must be
ready at his appointed place an hour after dawn
since they were old enough to walk they were drilled
and now they were ready that order only applied to
the rank and file of the expedition the officers trained
thoroughly in the recently resurrected art of warfare
had gathered from the four corners of the earth
months before for the last practice trips out into space
in the interstellar ships they were now gathered to-
gether for their final instructions a high standard
physically and mentally was demanded of the officers
in their hands would rest the fate of the expedition

  the officers had also to go through the ceremony of
swearing allegiance en viasse to the quota leaders of
each zone-a most impressive ceremony that would
mark the official end as far as the authorities of
earth were concerned to all further responsibilities of
the second great expedition from that moment on
it would be entirely in the hands of the six military
leaders and their six hundred thousand officers that
expedition was not like the first one of peace settle-
ment on far-off worlds beyond the bounds of the solar
system this was an expedition of conquest

  at the hundred and twenty-first century of the new
era the world was divided into three zones of almost
equal land surface and inhabited by the three great
divisions of man the white the yellow and the
black each zone was inhabited by the race which
could best stand the climate the zones were named
after the color of the inhabitants the black zone
was situated at the equator a wide swath of land
above and below the limits of the black zone was
known as the yellow zone while the white zone ex-
tended to the arctic and antarctic circles the regions
from the limits of the territory alloted to the white
races on the north and south to the poles belonged
equally to the three divisions of mankind the worlds
greatest mines were situated up there man looked
upon the north and south as his two great storehouses
of raw materials most of the raw materials needed and
the second swarm



used by him came from the land of the midnight sun
the polar regions were also two immense underground
factories which supplied the world with all of its
larger manufactured articles of metal and glass

  from each of the zones had been drawn an equal
quota of boys and girls-now men and women-of
high physical and mental standard in the years that
followed they were assigned to vocations for which the
tests showed they were best fitted and they were
trained thoroughly in the various trades professions
and sciences besides their vocations the rank and
file of the expedition were trained as a secondary con-
sideration in the art of warfare but the officers had
studied primarily the art of maneuvering the mighty
interstellar ships which were to carry the forces of
the expedition and to handle their terrible weapons of
destruction to lead their forces on landing and by
their example of utter disregard for life spur them on
in their conquest of that ringed satellite revolving
around bright sirius

  six were selected from among the officers to lead the
expedition three of each sex one for each quota the
six leaders-to-be were selected for their mental qual-
ities to command and lead their quotas as other youths
of the expedition were selected and trained in the oc-
cupations for which they were best fitted

  a few more brief hours and the day for which man
has waited for many years will have dawned the
night was still young it was being whispered with a
knowing smile that man would have a wild celebration
tonight and for many nights to come every one would
participate the old and the young those who were to
stay as well as the youths who were to go

  was there any wonder then that those who were
to go should try to tear themselves away as quickly as
they could for they with the utter thoughtlessness
of youth wanted to be out and enjoy the mad revelry
of this night which many were hinting about didnt
they deserve it they had trained and trained for
years little enjoyment had they gotten out of life
and this was to be their last night of freedom on
earth besides they wanted to get over the painful
scenes of parting as quickly as possible and be out with
their comrades those who were to be left behind
held on to them more tightly as the clocks ticked the
speeding minutes away

  the different levels of the wide avenues and narrower
side streets were already thronged with crowds of
laughing-eyed boys and girls-members of the expedi-
tion in their centers- while sober-eyed men and wo-
men stood watching from the windows the ages of
those who were to go ranged from twenty to twenty-
four only those so young could go for the journey
would take more than thirteen long years time enough
for them to mature but they did not seem to worry
they were happy extremely hilarious

  their overbubbling laughter was but youths natural
rebound of spirits from their heart-wrenching part-
ings at home they never expected to see any member
of their respective families again unless they caught
sight of them as they marched past them on the great
review tomorrow because from that display they would
march directly to the various underground railway de-
pots that would take them to the far north and to the
far south where their interstellar ships were in readi-
ness-long slender vehicles that were fully provisioned
to take them on their terrific voyage to the neighbor-
hood of sirius and the ringed world that revolved
around it

  arm in arm ten and more abreast with one or two
members of the expedition in the middle they swung
up and down the different levels talking laughing

singing-excitedly happy those who wore the white
yellow and black uniforms were scheduled to start at
midnight tomorrow youth made sport of everything
even of death they cared nothing for the tears and
dark forebodings of some of their pessimistic elders

  youth at no time ever gave heed to the uncer-
tainties of tomorrow was not the triumphant example
of the first great expedition ever before their eyes
who could forget their glory and the worlds that
they had gained for man out there urged them on
what did they care if the world which was the goal
of the second great expedition was already inhabited
by intelligent creatures who possessed weapons capable
of destroying their mighty interstellar ships it would
be a different story this time the expedition was no
mere scouting expedition they were equipped for war

  besides being the last night under the open star-
sprinkled sky from the surface of earth for the mem-
bers of the expedition it was the last day of the old
year tomorrow the first of the new the new year
had always been celebrated before the new year had
aged but one day they the rank and file of the expedi-
tion would all have entered their ships and be dead
as far as the inhabitants of earth were concerned

  it was growing late nearing midnight the great
day was approaching expectant eyes were turned im-
patiently up to the huge illuminated dials on the various
buildings and they watched the minute hands as they
slowly crept toward twelve just a few minutes more
and the new day and the new year would come into ex-
istence

  the people were pouring out of the great residential
buildings in their thousands more and more each pass-
ing instant as it approached closer to the hour of mid-
night the doorways were jammed it seemed as if
they couldnt come out of the buildings fast enough
at the different street levels so they began dropping
down on wings like fluttering leaves on a windy day
in autumn it was the same in every city and town of
any size the different street levels and recreation
squares were becoming packed to the point of suffoca-
tion the inhabitants of the huge piles of steel and
masonry seemed to have only one desire-to get out
into the open

  suddenly the strident whine of the attention-ar-
resters connected in series with the loud-speakers
signalled the people for silence a hush fell upon the
restless throngs on all levels the speaker whoever
he was must be important else the message must be
of vital interest or the radio loud-speakers on the
municipal building would not signal the people for
silence

  in every city and town in the world a voice began
to vibrate from the loud speakers near the top of the
public buildings the voice was recognized immediately
it belonged to thadeus president of the three zones
his kindly voice was addressing them inspiring them
as always

  it is primarily to you the young people of earth
who are going to extend the glories of man in other
worlds that i wish to speak you will never hear my
voice again i have put off this address to the last
moment i have no excuse to offer i wish that i
could go with you but i am old and the blood runs
sluggishly through my veins only youth with all its
reserve of vital forces can survive the journey

  it has come to my ears that many of you are plan-
ning excesses tonight which you will only regret later
you wish to throw all restraint aside but dont to-
night is to be dedicated to nobler thoughts to in-
spire you on to great deeds i have ordered the same
instruments to play that wonderful melody tonight that

was played for the first great expedition a thousand
years ago

  but i have something to say to you first you are
on tlffi eve of your -

  before he had well begun that last sentence the
hour of midnight came on the eastern seaboard of
america there was a sudden hush before the chimes
began to toll the dying year into eternity the silence
for an instant was tomb-like then a bell broke the
stillness another caught it up another and then an-
other bell after bell began to add its share to the
clangor every means that could produce sound was
brought into play the discordant jarring din that
they made was appalling and then when the noise
was at its height not till then the youths that packed
the different levels gave voice to their joy wildly
they cried their hurrahs their shouting for a moment
even drowned the bells and other shrill noise producers

  then as if to welcome the newborn year beams of
intensely brilliant light flashed upon the heavens they
were of every conceivable shade and color and came
from thousands upon thousands of huge searchlights
each a billion candle-powered or more-their rays
sweeping back and forth upon the dark midnight sky

  they blended melting into each other living colors
that changed and changed and changed the beams be-
gan to sweep in circles ever widening and narrowing

interweaving one into the other the heavens from
horizon to horizon were criss-crossed with them then
all as one the beams went off then on then off the
combined light of all the myriads of high powered
searchlights still interweaving into each other started
to pulsate off and on faster and faster

  the swift pulsations of light had an exhilarating
effect upon those who watched the blood in their
veins began to circulate faster their breath began to
quicken other colors unimaginable in their splendor
came out and swept the heavens as waves move across
a sea by their light the night was being turned into
a man-made day

  the discordant clangor of the bells seemed to pause
in indescision died down to a mere whisper and then
were stilled but the beams of colored light still puls-
ated and swept across the midnight sky

  but what was that which was coming oh so slowly
from far off it crept nearer and nearer what was it
the senses strained then it was recognized by the
ear as vibrations-sound it came closer became
louder it echoed dully from point to point of a sud-
den it was everywhere sweeping down upon the earth
bursting forth like the staccato of a mighty drum-
as if the taut sky of the earth itself were being used
for a drum it beat time then accompanying it
there wailed forth the liquid notes of a violin a
violin magnified a billion billion times a colossal violin
yet not-not loud

spasmodically it rose and fell upon the night air
the night which no longer was night it sobbed in a
sudden ecstasy of joy it sang with the promise of a
wondrous future it wailed as if it hinted at the
thought of failure then it rose higher and higher as if
it were ashamed of such lowly thoughts it changed
from mood to mood until it seemed to catch the feel-
ings of hilarious youth that thronged the open it car-
ried them up and up into the sublime heights of emo-
tional enthusiasm it made them feel that for man-
the secone swarm



kind they would go through the torments of the
damned then it took on the stately tones of an
anthem but ofttimes it sobbed until the soul seemed
to sob in tune with it

  melody the like of which had been played a thous-
and years ago to send off the first great expedition
on its successful venture played on through the night
while the intensely brilliant beams of colored light
kept perfect time the mind can hardly comprehend
the volume of it or its wonderful all-pervading inspira-
tion it told of man climbing up and up never rest-
ing the throbbing of the drum and the sobbing of
the violin tore the heartstrings apart with the wonder-
ful melody and with the story it tried to tell

  hours passed it seemed as if that melody would
continue through all eternity like the so-called music
of the spheres

  the first day of the year  of the new era
dawned on the following day the second great ex-
pedition was scheduled to be launched into the bound-
less infinity of space toward sirius the first great
expedition had gone toward alpha centauri and met
with no opposition they had peacefully taken posses-
sion of the two worlds which their scouts had selected
as the only two fit for human habitation their ships
were not filled with weapons for destruction but with
tools for construction to each who had braved the
terrors of the unknown there had been allotted a
thousand acres of the choicest land upon the surface
of those worlds

  it would be different though for those who com-
prised the second great expedition this would be
no peaceful settlement the ringed world the only
planet around sirius was inhabited by intelligent crea-
tures the inhabitants of that world had proved them-
selves well prepared to defend their world against in-
vaders thousands of men had already lost their lives
upon that world before one hostile move had been
made

  it became a matter of self-preservation upon the
surface of that ringed world there were a number of
interstellar ships which the creatures had managed to
bring down some were instantly destroyed others
were not to creatures as intelligent as they un-
doubtedly were the machinery within the interior of
those intersteller ships was not too intricate nor the
driving mechanism too hard to understand to the
race of man there were three reasons why their extinc-
tion was a vital necessity they were too well prepared
for war too near the solar system too near level of
man

  on the wide first balcony of the recently erected
academy of war thadeus president of the three
zones a spare stately figure of a man grown old
slowly stood watching the almost endless line of of-
ficers of the expedition one hundred abreast as they
drew near the wide portals for the farewell address
and the ceremony of swearing allegiance en masse to
the six selected leaders proudly they carried them-
selves they moved as one president thadeuss kindly
yet determined face lit up with pride-just pride for
had he not devoted the major portion of his life to
the preparation of the expedition when death had
called his predecessor ably had he grasped the reins
that the cold hands had let go and brought the prepar-
ations of the second great expedition to a successful
termination he had done yet more he had personally
taken charge of the training of the officers though
his duties were manifold he never missed an oppor-
tunity to watch them and note their improvements

  the recently erected academy of war-which had
been built primarily to teach the science of warfare to

the officers of the second great expedition stood in an
isolated spot far in front of the three governmental
cities which represented the three zones of earth
the three governmental cities were really one divided
into three triangles and separated from each other by
mile-wide paved boulevards the two paved boulevards
came together in front of the academy

  down one of the boulevards officers and men were
marching they were the officers of the black quota
and would be the first to enter at the head of the
officers of the black zone strode their young com-
mander he was distinguished from the rest of his
officers by a flaming-red silken crepe over his jet black
uniform which was long enough to reach from shoulder
to heels and which fluttered out behind him as he moved
proudly forward

  the balcony upon which president thadeus stood
was five hundred feet above the paved surface below
the academy of war was the tallest building on
earth its topmost pinnacle towered thirty-eight hun-
dred and some seventy odd feet above the surrounding
country

  upon the balcony on either side of the president
stood zenofia commander of the black female quota
and ureena commander of the yellow female quota
each was watching the marching officers through a pair
of powerful binoculars the two leaders had over their
uniforms their flaming-red capes the insignia of their
rank

  zenofia towered over the other two on the balcony
she stood five feet eleven inches in height and one
had but to glance into her eyes to see why she had
been selected to lead her quota she possessed in-
telligence determination which could surmount all ob-
stacles and the power to have her slightest command
obeyed without question ureena in contrast was
barely five feet in height and built daintily there was
little they had in common except the power to lead
where the other would climb ureena would go around
strategy not determination was her forte

  matilda commander of the white female quota
possessed the qualities of both besides a dash of reck-
less daring she was hovering near the balcony on a
pair of individual flying wings which were strapped
firmly upon her shoulders with a metal brace and
wide straps the flying wings were thin reinforced
metal plates that could open and close like the feathers
in the wings of a bird each wing measured a fraction
over thirty-six inches and was made of an aluminum
alloy that was much stronger than the finest steel
what the wings lacked in size they made up in power
for the wings were operated by a powerful atomic
motor that weighed only five pounds yet could de-
velop twenty horsepower with ease the atomic motor
could vibrate the wings as fast as the wings of an
insect vibrate over her head and fastened to her
shoulders she wore a conical helmet of transparent sub-
stance that lessened the air-resistance and let her
breathe evenly

  the blacks had nearly all entered the great academy
and the yellows with their yellow uniforms were just
coming into view down the second boulevard at their
head strode keelen commander of the yellow male
quota ureena commander of the yellow female
quota leaned over the balustrade to watch him through
her glasses a little better they were betrothed

  commander keelen at the head of his officers was ap-
proaching swiftly no one could mistake him with his
cape of flaming-red silk that fluttered behind him his
badge of leadership impulsively ureena called to
him though she did not expect him to hear the
tramp of thousands of metal-shod feet in perfect

unison would have drowned out her voice had it been
a hundred times as loud thadeus who was standing
between the two girl leaders glanced down at her and
smiled well did he know of their attachment for each
other it was one of the few things at which he
wondered greatly her-their feeling for each other
was a throwback to when love not eugenics ruled
mating

  through her glasses ureena saw keelens head go
back and his eyes begin to travel up the wall of the
academy of war to the first balcony upon which she
stood she waved her arms wildly to attract his at-
tention she leaned over the balustrade a little too far
and lost her balance with a startled shriek she slipped
over the top of the balustrade

  at her shrill cry president thadeus turned his head
and saw her falling his hands darted out and caught
the red silken cape as it fluttered over but the cape
was very thin and began to rip almost before it felt
the full strain at the other end zenofia the black
leader was more than a half dozen paces from thadeus
at the cry she too turned her head she grasped the
situation instantly and began to run toward the falling
girl there was a slight chance that she might reach
there in time to put her hand through the openings
in the balustrade and catch hold of ureenas clothing
before she fell

  matilda the white leader who was hovering near on
wing heard the cry and realized that she must act at
once if the other was to be saved the cape was part-
ing swiftly zenofia was still four paces off

  if ureena was not saved the rank and file of the
expedition-the masses even at this late date were still
in a measure superstitious-would consider it a dread-
ful omen it would take the heart out of many she
had the power to help if she could reach her in time
so almost as quick as a flash she plunged to the aid
of the little yellow leader but even before she sped
her own length she saw that the cape must break be-
fore she could possibly reach her it seemed as if the
few whole threads in the cape were snapping

  the air seemed to quiver with chilled suspense the
tramp of the thousands of metal-shod feet below
sounded as if they came from a distance immeasurably
far off from a different world

  matilda saw the face of thadeus turn deathly pale
as he gazed at her and saw how far off she was he
heard the thud of flying feet behind him and glanced
back out of the corner of his eye zenofia was still
three paces off glistening beads of sweat came out
all over his wrinkled face the wings upon her back
were beating the air heavily to gain the momentum
she saw his lips frame the words

  faster faster

  but still she was far off every fraction of an in-
stant she was gaining speed would she be in time

  the cape parted with an awful despairing cry
ureena plunged downward half of her flaming-red
cape fluttered behind her like a meteor she fell

  matilda reached the spot a second too late with
the speed of a shot she hurtled after her the hum of
the metal wings on her back grew shrill with their
speed and their power

  those on the ground level five hundred feet below
felt the impending danger of the body that was hurtling
down toward them they looked up those directly
under the balcony took in the full significance of the
tragedy and started to draw back hastily those from
a distance saw the white leader hurtle after the other
in a desperate effort to save it seemed futile to them
yet their breaths were tightly drawn in as they saw
her increase her downward speed still more

  commander keelen who was glancing at the huge
sculptured figure of mars the ancient god of war just
above the main entrance to the academy not up at
the balcony as ureena had imagined also glanced up
into the field of his vision flashed the bright yellow
uniform and the fluttering half of the flaming-red
cape only one on earth had the right to that combin-
ation on this day he started to run to the spot
directly under as if he could break the force of her
fall with his own body he did not seem to realize that
he could never reach the spot in time and if he did
the force of her fall from that height would crush
them both to pulp

  faster and yet faster did matilda drop in pursuit the
wings on her back whining terribly as they forced her
down with the speed of a bullet her hands were out-
stretched her body was as straight as an arrow and
rigid only her fingers moved opening and closing
spasmodically upon the empty air would she never
reach ureena

  at last the tips of her fingers touched the fluttering
half of ureenas cape then it fluttered about her
wrists now her hands gripped cloth and held it was
not the thin silken half of the cape but the sturdy
yellow uniform underneath

  the wings their action slowly reversed braked their
downward rush and after a moment of poising began
to draw them both up

  just a moment or so and it was over

  from below there rose a roar as the seeming impos-
sibility was accomplished a moment later the name
of the lady who was snatched from death ran like
wildfire through the ranks of those below pandem-
onium followed those below were mainly the officers
of the yellow quota

  the look of gratitude that old thadeus gave her as
she hovered over the balcony with her burden more
than repaid her for what she had done president
thadeus had always been like a fond father to the
three female leaders

  his eager hands reached trembling for ureena and
laid her gently upon the marble floor of the balcony
she did not move he bent his head to her breast and
detected the fluttering beat of her heart he began
stroking her hands

  she uttered a long drawn-out sigh her eyelids
quivered for a moment and then opened wide wildly
she gazed about surprise was in her eyes as she real-
ized where she was and saw the familiar faces of
those she knew bent over her it was plain to see that
she did not expect to find herself in the land of the
living again

  physically she was none the worse for her narrow es-
cape the scare that she received however would
probably make her afraid to venture upon high places
again

  she made an effort to speak gulped and then asked
incredulously

  was it only a dream that i felt myself slipping
over the balustrade and falling to certain death on
the stones below did i not really fall

  yes child thadeus answered softly you did fall
but you were saved by your white sister who was
hovering near on wing you are not hurt my child
are you he ended anxiously

  ureena shook her head

  her rescuer who had perched herself on the top of
the balustrade waited to hear no more she stood
up turned her back on those on the balcony and
started her wings a-vibrating the wings drew her
up up until she was at the three thousand-foot level
and then she sped like an arrow toward the barracks
the second swarm



where her thousands of girl captains were gathered
waiting for her to come and lead them

  she reached her own private quarters and changed
her flying outfit for a snow-white uniform and cape
of flaming-red swiftly she opened the door leading out
of her quarters and ram for the lifts that were to
carry her down to the fourth street level she sped
across the moving sidewalks until she was  the
one that traveled a mile-a-minute and took a seat five
minutes later she was at the head of the female of-
ficers of the white quota

  at the door which let out to the first balcony of the
academy of war there came a scraping of metal-shod
feet on the marble threshold the door was given a
heavy thud it swayed outward but did not open it
sounded as though someone had staggered against it
the noise attracted the attention of those on the bal-
cony

  on the face of president thadeus there appeared
a red flush of anger what clumsy fool was out there
who could not see where he was going

  the door was given another thud and swung open
a man appeared upon the threshold he rocked back
and forth upon his feet he was panting painfully
like a man who disregarding or forgetting the fast
pneumatic lifts had climbed the rarely used spiral
stairway on a run from the first street level

  what do you want one of the physicians de-
manded

  the man did not reply his face was of a sickly
yellow-greyish color and streaked with sweat his
eyes were wild hardly able to stand he staggered to
where ureena lay

  ureena held out her hands to him startled thad-
eus recognized the man it was keelen the co-leader
of the yellow forces his yellow uniform was covered
with dust from running up the spiral stairway his
red silken cape was slashed to ribbons by the heels of
his metal-shod feet as he leapt up the stairs three and
more at a time

  keelen saw that her eyes were open and that she
appeared to be unharmed with a glad cry of relief he
threw himself down upon his knees beside her

  he could not speak

  she reached up and stroked his face tenderly she
understood words between them were unnecessary

  where is she ureena suddenly demanded quickly
looking around

  who keelen asked tenderly

  matilda i have not thanked her yet

  keelen shook his head

  thadeus volunteered the information that she had
left to rejoin her officers it was growing late and
according to the schedule the white quota of the
second great expedition both male and female had to
be on their way north and south to the polar regions
within the next three hours

  how can i repay her ureena broke in it is
not for myself that i value my life so but for you

  keelen thadeus said slowly it is time for you to
take your place at the head of your officers in the
auditorium below remember the schedule nothing
must interfere now everything must move as smooth-
ly as clockwork the white female quota of officers
led by their leader is even now on its way here you
can see them through the openings in the balustrade
each of you must speed to your place if ureena can-
not go i will appoint a proxy to lead them and she
can take her place in the auditorium

  i will go at once father ureena spoke up i am
still a bit dizzy but it will soon pass

  very well child he replied but you must hurry

faster and aster did matilda drop in pursuit the wings on her back
whining terribly as they forccd her down with tho speed of a bullot
her hands wero outstretched her body was as straight as an arrow
and rigid only her fingers moved opening and closing spasmodically
upon the empty air would sho never reach ureena

each of you must take your place at the proper in-
stant there must be no waiting after the ceremony
of allegiance you must go your separate ways each to
lead your legions now go hurry

  a moment more sire commander keelen pleaded

  a moment no more thadeus granted

  he turned and beckoned to the others and strode into
the interior of the academy they moved swiftly to-
ward the lifts commander zenofia and the physicians
going down to the moving platforms below the ground
level while president thadeus went up to his suite to
don his raiment for the ceremony at which he would
officiate

  an hour later president thadeus stepped into one
of the fast pneumatic lifts at the two thousand foot
level upon which his suite was situated and dropped
swiftly down at the thousand foot level he stopped
and looked out through the transparent sides of the
cage his eyes slowly took in the details of the vast
auditorium of the academy of war he could see
from the thousand foot height that half of the im-
mense auditorium which was reserved for the male
officers of the second great expedition was already
packed every one of the three hundred thousand seats
was occupied while the other half which was re-
served for the female officers was rapidly filling up
then his eyes traveled up up to the thirty-second bal-
cony and took in the thousands of the leading men
and women of earth from all three zones who were
sitting there patiently

  again he touched the button and the lift sank to the
two hundred and fifty foot level on which stood the
speakers box just above the middle stage of the three
great stages underneath as he made his way from the
lift along a glass-enclosed gallery to the same box he
was pleased to see commander keelen with a new cape
of flaming-red silk on his raised seat facing the yel-
low officers the two other commanders were also there
on their raised seats the white yellow and black
uniforms set each quota off distinctly

  next he turned his eyes toward the other side and
saw that commander matilda was already seated in
front of her officers commauder zenofia of the black
legions was also there with her officers the female
officers of the yellow quota who should have followed
the white forces into the academy were just entering
one hundred abreast and at their head proudly moved
commander ureena

  as soon as they were all seated president thadeus
gave the signal slowly the solemn ceremony of swear-
ing allegiance to the six leaders was gotten under
way then after he finished reading his farewell ad-
dress added

  for well over two hundred years the people of
earth have labored unceasingly for this day they
have toiled made virtual slaves of themselves worked
themselves into early graves so that you who are
going may lack nothing long long ago man adopted
as his own one of the primary laws of the social order
of insects and followed unswervingly their example of
placing the race high above themselves their work
their own petty ambitions to you who are going will
be the glory to them the toil perhaps as they
labored at their tasks they dreamed that it was they
themselves who were going

  even after you have left the surface of earth we
will continue to aid you we who remain will force
our will power to accompany you and help you succeed
as the inhabitants of earth a thousand years ago
willed the success of the first great expedition which
they launched perhaps it was the strengthening power
of that will added to their own determination which

held them to their course until success crowned their
efforts true they had nothing to contend with as
you will have and the only risks they ran were the
ordinary risks which attend the crossing of inter-
stellar spaces yet without that accompanying will
and resolution they might have lost heart before they
were halfway toward their destination when they
blundered into the head of a dark comet they lost
a number of ships had they been on the lookout that
accident would not have befallen them the ships of
the present expedition are all equipped with a device
which will warn you of anything in your path still
they were pioneers and to them belongs the glory

  peacefully they took possession of two worlds that
revolve around alpha centauri on not one of those
two worlds was there animal life of any description
nothing but a sort of low plant life which resembled
moss and was of a deep blush color the various do-
mestic animals that they had taken along with them
became acclimatized very easily  those planets and
probably never knew that they had been transported to
alien worlds while the seeds of various kinds of plant
life which man had found useful thrived wonderfully
when insect life was introduced from earth to fertilize
them better even than on their own native world
which they had left behind forever

  sirius is really a double star or as it is better
known to the astronomers a binary its companion
is of insignificant size but of intense density its dis-
tance from sirius is a little more than the distance
which separates the planet uranus from our sun
sirius as you know is larger and hotter than our
yellow dwarf sun

  we on earth have an idea of the kind of life that
exists on the ringed world that revolves around sirius
and its heavy dwarf companion its inhabitants have
some kind of globular central body with numerous limb-
like appendages and have a high degree of intelli-
gence they menace the security of our existence
the few of our spies who returned were fast in the
grip of a terrible disease which our physicians later
conquered they had been able to see some of the
works of the strange beings huge masses of masonry
comparable to our greatest buildings whatever kind
of life exists there remember commanders and cap-
tains of the second great expedition that man is
supreme mankind to the race of men is all-
important 

  when this memorial day ends you will start
when you leave earth behind the powerful will of
all mankind will follow you will always be behind you
will aid you may victory always crown your efforts
out there on that planet which has its orbit around
sirius one thing i shall try to impress upon your
minds and you must impress it upon the minds of
those that come after you do not forget to be true
to earth and its inhabitants if you ever need our
aid call and we will come if we call upon you do
not be slow in coming

  with that he turned slowly upon his heel and made
his way along the glass covered gallery to where he
could get the lift that would take him up to his suite
on the two thousand foot level he did not wait to
see the quota of the white zone stand up and begin
to file out the women following the men

  the army of captains from the white zone male
and female each going their own way marched briskly
to the various underground railway depots near the
three governmental cities that were to take them to
the polar regions the men to the north the women to
the south the rank and file of the second great ex-
pedition had embarked from thousands of cities and

minute tto the first mighty interateuar hip slowly began to reer up unul ita aherp note pointed up at an angle ol forly-five degree
then it roae hcuvenwards following fast behind it came ten more of the huge interstellar ships

         terior and the space between the doors would also
         automatically be exhausted of air

           each interstellar ship was designed to carry a
 crew of one hundred officers whose duties were
 to guide and operate the ship on its voyage across
 space and if necessary to handle the weapons
 pf destruction with which each ship was amply equipped
 the complicated driving mechanism was wholly auto-
 matic and an occasional glimpse to see that all was run-
 ning smoothly was all that was necessary each of the
 interstellar ships was also designed to carry nine thous-
 and and nine hundred of the rank and file whose duties
 would not commence until the ship had reached its des-
 tination

 the greater distance which the second great ex-
pedition had to travel and the fact that it was an out
and out expedition of conquest presented many new
problems to subdue intelligent creatures who in-
habited that world an expedition which numbered
many millions was necessary sixty million human be-
ings composed the swarm that would settle down upon
the ringed world

towns and the first were already at their destination
undergoing certain preparations which did not apply to
the officers

  the whole earth just below the surface was criss-
crossed with tunnels at a speed which was truly ter-
rific the underground trains traveled through express
tunnels all the way to the polar regions the fac-
tories within the arctic and antarctic circles were all
far underground there was not a building upon the
surface six thousand mighty interstellar ships which
were going to take the second great expedition on its
long journey also dotted the surface of those icy
regions of north and south

  except the six which were to carry the commanders
each of the remaining five thousand nine hundred and
ninety-four interstellar ships was a mile in length the
forward end of each vehicle was of hardened metal
and came to a point the rear which gradually tapered
from the point of greatest diameter near the
middle was one hundred and fifty feet in diameter
end held a glass-like lens slightly convex that was
to drive the interstellar ship at a speed which nearly
approached that of light itself the lens were built

up of separate sections and somewhat resembled the com-
pound eye of an insect

  the vehicles were all constructed of a special alloy
which could withstand the extremes of temperature
with the least expansion and contraction the alloy
could not under the most adverse conditions rust or
corrode all the vehicles had three separate walls
the space between the walls was exhausted of air and
so formed a two-fold vacuum that would insulate the
interior from the cold of the void between the stars
once the men were within three massive air-tight doors
closed each of the eight entrances into the ships in-

  from many underground railway depots the men of
the expedition had started marching up to the surface
of the polar regions where the interstellar ships lay
half buried in pits of packed snow and ice though
the men were oflicerless there was not the slightest
confusion as soon as they reached the surface in an
orderly fashion that plainly told of long days of
training they formed into ranks a score abreast and
marched to the interstellar ships each body of men
to its assigned place every interstellar ship was
numbered with gigantic numerals and the guides to
them were roads of snow packed to icy hardness

   physicians not belonging to the expedition but hav-
ing a vital duty to perform before its departure had
arrived during the preceding week from all parts of
the world and had taken up temporary quarters aboard
the ships to each of the six thousand mighty ships
had been assigned two hundred of the physicians they
had barely finished what preparations they had to
make before the men began to arrive aboard each of
the ships in a steady stream

  everything moved with automatic smoothness there
was no hesitation no needless delay each man knew
what he had to do each man did what was required
of him

   on entering the ships the men five hundred or so at
a time were led into a huge chamber in the very heart
of the ships and ordered to strip every member of
the rank and file had on his otherwise physically per-
fect body ten or more pounds of excess fat they were
then ordered to pack their clothes in their kit bags
and toss them in certain large bins

  as soon as the physicians examined them-the men
were inoculated with an antitoxin against the disease
germs that the men in the plague ship had brought
back with them from the ringed world-they were
exposed to certain rays and led through a series of
tanks containing various solutions they were then
marched through cleansing showers after which they
dried themselves before screens throwing off radiant
heat and as they moved along by the press of those
behind they were dusted with a fine powder of
sweet cloying fragrance which was strongly anti-
septic naked as the day they were born they followed
each other in a steady stream into a much larger
chamber filled from floor to ceiling with deep coffin-
like bunks row after row until they seemed almost
countless and ordered to lie down in them each
bunk contained a bedding of blankets spun from long
asbestos fibre also a lid of glass-like substance which
would bend but would not break

   as they crawled into the bunks they cried their fare-
wells to each other they shifted around until they
found a comfortable position and then grew still
their thoughts claimed all of their attention

  physicians passed along the rows of bunks and in-
jected the drugs which caused instant suspension of
animation the effect of those drugs would not wear
off until a certain antidote was injected the men
would need neither food nor oxygen they could lie
in the death-like state of suspended animation for
many years without any ill effects except for the grad-
ual diminution of their weight the lids were then
snapped down and fastened

  before they had finished their task the officers be-
gan to arrive and went about their duties at once
paying little attention to the physicians who were
working on the last batch the officers knew all about
the preparations for the long sleep suspended ani-
mation and how to awaken the sleepers even if
they had wanted to they could not watch time was
precious

   the officers on entering their proper stations made
 sure that the levers controlling the motors and pro-
 pelling rays were working smoothly made themselves
 thoroughly familiar with their posts there was no
 need for them to explore the ship which was to be their
 prison for the next thirteen and a half years they
 were familiar with every detail they held themselves
 in readiness waiting for the signal

   the same thing was going on in the south where
the women were also getting ready

   the physicians had just left were hurrying to the
underground depots as fast as they could the time
scheduled for the departure was near to be out in
the open when the ships started to leave would be
certain death

   according to the schedule it lacked but a few min-
utes to the starting time the doors were snapped
shut the act of closing the triple doors automatically
started the pumps to empty the air between each set
of three doors it did not take long to form the
necessary vacuum when the ships that were to go first
had done so they signalled that they were ready

   it was four minutes after one a m of the second
day of the year  of the new era four minutes
late that the first mighty interstellar ship slowly began
to rear up until its sharp nose pointed up at an
angle of forty-five degrees then it rose heavenwards
it was propelled by the invisible rays of the fifty-fifth
octave it was the ship that carried the leader of
the white male quota following fast behind it came
ten more of the huge interstellar ships from the
south commander matildas ship flashed up into the
heavens toward bright sirius

   in two streams one from the north and one from
the south the interstellar ships started on their long
journey into the utter void of that airless space be-
tween the sun and sirius every minute twenty ships
left the surface of earth it took nearly two hours
before the white quota alone left the polar regions
the yellow quota waiting an hour started next fast
on the heels of the yellow quota came those from the
black zone

   the propelling power of the invisible rays of the
fifty-fifth octave swept them along at two-thirds the
speed of light the six slightly larger ships which
carried the leaders of each zone were also equipped
with the fifty-sixth octave and were able to travel
within a few miles of the speed of light itself

   on and on they sped from far off the second great
expedition like the split tail of a comet cleaved the
void of space at two-thirds the speed of light each
quota of men and women kept to themselves in long
quivering lines there was no attempt for one to
mingle with the other

   five years passed the sun had long ago dwindled
to the brightness of an ordinary pin-point of light
it was far inferior in brightness to sirius toward
which they were speeding five long uneventful years
have slowly crawled by since they left the limits of
the solar system behind the officers oil all ships had
decided to celebrate the day there was of course
neither day nor night nor year out there but they
governed themselves according to their chronometers
which kept earth-time

   another year passed they were in direct radio com-
munication with each other nothing broke the dread-
ful monotony of the seemingly endless journey the
accompanying will that the inhabitants of earth had
sent out to spur them on was beginning to make it-
self felt as their own enthusiasm lagged they needed
something to spur them on out there in the depths of
space between stars there was nothing absolutely noth-
the second swarm



ing not even a lonely comet flashed by the rank and
file of the expedition were still sunk in a death-like
coma and for them naturally time did not exist

  the yellow quota of men who had started in sec-
ond place began to gain on the leaders the officers
of the white quota sensing a means to break the ter-
rible monotony a race increased the speed of their
ships to the utmost limit still the yellow legions con-
tinued to draw near little by little they crept up
until at length the lines of the two quotas flashed along
side by side the yellow quota held that position
for a while and then began to draw ahead slowly
but surely

  commander keelen flashed the news of his achieve-
ment to ureena commander of the yellow female
forces and told her to try and do likewise

  the black quota chaffed the whites unmercifully
they likened them to snails snails speeding along at
nearly two-thirds the speed of light almost 
miles a second

in front of commander keelens ship there
appeared numerous hazy pin-points those
with tho keenest sight at the eye-pieces of
tho telescopes could barely make them out
   momentarily they grew brighter and
clcarer

that carried the leaders had instruments of far greater
delicacy

  the yellow quota was in the lead far in front of
the main body of the yellow forces hurtled the inter-
stellar ship that carried commander keelen behind
the yellow quota in a long line followed the white
force which had not been able to regain the first place
it had lost

  suddenly the instruments in commander keelens
ship began to give warning of some impending danger
far ahead the officers who had been everywhere but
at their proper places hurried to their stations tele-

  commander ureena and her quota began to get
ahead the two halves of the expedition the men and
the women were about one light hour apart the dis-
tance that it takes light one hour to cross

  the officers dulled by long years of endless mon-
otony into the belief of the absolute emptiness of
space between suns had ceased to be on the lookout
each ship was equipped with two extremely powerful
telescopes the telescopes which had been used al-
most continuously at first were rarely used now it
would have been suicidal for the second great expedi-
tion to have to depend upon men peering through the
telescopes to disclose objects that lay in their path
at the terrific velocity they were traveling the ships
were one and all equipped with electrical instruments
to warn the expedition of danger far ahead the six

scopes were trained ahead nothing could be seen
the instruments continued to sound their warnings
stronger each instant

  he sent warning back to the rest of the expedition
and commanded them to come to a full stop as quickly
as they could he then ordered ten ships of his quota
to go slowly forward with him to investigate

  in front of commander keelens ships there ap-
peared numerous hazy pin-points of light those with
the keenest sight at the eye-pieces of the telescopes
could barely make them out they were almost at the
limit of vision momentarily they grew brighter and
nearer they began to take on form the pin-points of
light were all revolving rapidly around a common
center the instruments that they trained upon them
showed that each pin point of light was of disk-like

formation and measurable calculations gave them a
diameter that ranged from four to eight miles they
had probably come from the direction of sirius and
were traveling in the general direction of the solar
system

  he had the information flashed back to the rest of
the expedition that directly in front of them were
hundreds of spheres each from four to eight miles in
diameter he gave the order to the ten ships to fol-
low him more closely it was a dangerous thing to do
the spheres were approaching at a terrific speed

  the spheres were whirling swiftly around each other
in their forward flight through the void of the inter-
stellar space they were describing a cork-screw path
they presented a solid impassable front suddenly
one of the spheres which was a little ahead of the
others paused in its whirling forward motion the
spheres behind gradually slackened their speed and
came to a stop they seemed to become aware of the
eleven ships in front of them

  it was the first sign that those in commander
keelens ship had that the spheres contained intelli-
gent reasoning beings that the spheres themselves
were interstellar ships during the next few hours it
was verified in the most terrible manner from the
first ball that had paused there broke forth a flash of
lurid flame like flaming gas under pressure issuing
from the mouth of a great cannon it was followed im-
mediately by another and then another nothing hap-
pened fifteen or more minutes later one of the mighty
interstellar ships that accompanied commander keelens
ship in front of the expedition crumpled up as if it
had met something in headlong collision became par-
tially incandescent and exploded an instant later an-
other ship met the same fate

  without a sound the two ships had exploded the
bolts that had come from the sphere in the lead from
monster weapons within the sphere did their work
silently sound must have a medium to transmit its
waves it cannot cross a vacuum

  the remaining nine ships in front stopped dead on
the destruction of the two for an instant com-
mander keelen and the officers were numbed into a
state of immobility by the sudden disaster that had
befallen them in each of the two ships that had gone
down to instant destruction there had been ten thous-
and human beings

  the spheres surrounded them on all sides and were
coming slowly closer it could now be seen that the
surface of those spheres were covered with bright
spots like windows and the light was streaming through
them from the brightly lighted interior they pre-
sented a formidable appearance

  were the brave legions from earth to meet their
doom in the infinite void of space far from the ringed
planet that circled bright sirius and its faint com-
panion was the second great expedition of man
fated to be destroyed by the intelligent creatures within
the globular ships of space that had come from the
probable direction of sirius had the inhabitants of
the ringed world that circled sirius known of mans
coming and sent these death-dealing spheres out to
meet him had they in turn scouts spying upon the
inhabitants of earth

  lurid sheets of flame with their accompanying bolts
again came from the sphere there was another in-
terval of about a quarter of an hour in which nothing
happened nothing was to be seen no warning came
from the electrical apparatus which was to warn the
officers of an approaching body the moments dragged
by and then a bolt struck the ship which was a little
behind and to the right of commander keelens an-

other bolt met in headlong collision with the inter-
stellar ship that was to the left of him only seven
remained in the front

  they came back to life with a start the numbness
dropping from them as death stared them in the face
they manned their own terrible instruments of de-
struction the forward end of each ship which came
to a point split into a number of segments and drew
back into the interior of the ship out in front there
remained an egg-shaped object of transparent sub-
stance resembling quartz glass it was supported by
three thick rods of the same substance the rods and
egg-shaped object in front of each ship began to glow
with a pale-yellow color it could be seen issuing for a
few feet at the forward end like liquid it traveled
much slower than light

  the propelling rays of the fifty-fifth octave were
turned on full the interstellar ship started to plunge
forward four circular holes appeared some distance
back from the glowing egg-shaped object at the tip
of the ship a puff of white vapor and red flame sud-
denly leapt out of each of the openings the mighty
interstellar ships rocked back to the shock the puffs
of white vapor and red flames appeared at the open-
ings of each ship again and again swifter and swifter
until they were pouring forth continuously though
the driving rays were on full the ships quivered and
stood still at last the remaining seven of the eleven
ships that had gone forward to investigate were going
into action

  the pale-yellow glow which emanated from com-
mander keelens ship far in front of the other six
reached the sphere in the lead from which had come
the bolts that had destroyed the four ships of the yel-
low quota it touched it lightly seemed to caress it it
was not like a beam of light but a corpuscle stream
it spread over the sphere like molten gold until it had
enveloped it the sphere seemed to vibrate became in-
distinct was gone-destroyed the glow reached over
and touched another sphere

  the beings in the globular ships of space seemed to
realize the menace of those pale-yellow beams crea-
tures to build and operate those huge spheres must
possess a very high order of intelligence the de-
structive power of that pale-yellow glow was startling
desperately and in a solid sheet the lurid flame and
the accompanying bolts shot from the nearer spheres

  the glow from the other six ships seemed to touch
with hazy golden fingers and then to caress six other
spheres what had shot from the four openings of
each of the seven ships in continuous streams with
the puffs of white vapor and the red flame also reached
the spheres glowing incandescent spots began to
pit the surface of a few of them

  the flashes of the lurid light with its accompany-
ing bolts from the spheres were increasing steadily
one and then another of the interstellar ships from
earth met the bolts in headlong collision

  globular ship of space after globular ship of space
faded from sight as the pale-yellow glow spread over
them a number of the nearer spheres became so
covered with incandescent spots that they became mol-
ten masses of metal

  only five out of the original eleven interstellar ships
in the front remained though they brought down
three and more to every one of their own they were
going down to certain destruction there were too
many spheres to cope with the bolts hurtling all
around them picked them off one by one

  now only two remained one as if by a miracle
was the mighty ship that carried commander keelen
his ship was causing the greatest havoc amongst
the second swarm



the spheres something went wrong with the pale-
yellow glow the egg-shaped object of quartz-like glass
was shattered by a flying fragment of one of the
interstellar ships

  realizing that he was about doomed he had word
sent back that he was going to try to destroy yet
one more of the globular ships of space with his
own mighty interstellar ship he did not think of
turning tail if he had any thought of retreating
it was too late now the bolts would pick him off
before he turned he had only a few minutes to live
he sent his last farewells winging back to earth to
the expedition to the yellow quota and to the one
whom he loved more than life itself telling them all
to carry on and not let this first setback dishearten
them he for one was going to show those creatures
how man could die the puffs of white vapor and
red flame which were being expelled from his four
huge cannon ceased the openings closed swiftly
his ship gained headway each instant it doubled its
speed

  the intelligent creatures who manned the spheres
saw what commander keelen was about to attempt
they knew what would happen if his ship traveling
now at a large fraction of the speed of light should
hit one of their globular ships of space the lurid
flames with their accompanying bolts came from each
sphere in a terrible stream the other interstellar
ship was hit and destroyed

  commander keelens mighty ship struck a globular
ship of space there was a brilliant flare of light
and both ships went up in a blinding white-hot mass
of flaming gas

  the news of commander keelens destruction reached
the first of the expedition the yellow quota grit-
ting their teeth started forward they were heading
straight for the spheres to avenge him they wouldnt
be caught by surprise

  an hour later word reached commander ureena that
the co-commander of the yellow forces with eleven
ships had been destroyed had gone down bravely to
death as soon as she received the message she
slackened speed and swerved from the course she
was following and headed in the direction of the
spheres she too was going to avenge the death of
her betrothed and the thousands sunk in the state of
suspended animation who would never know what
struck them behind her streamed a thousand ships
of her own quota

  the spheres continued in their course the beings
inside of the spheres must have reasoned that they had
destroyed all of those long slender ships that had sud-
denly appeared in front of them those long vehicles
that they had encountered voyaging across the utter
void of space were terrible foes they had weapons
of unlimited destructive power the pale-yellow glow
in particular thirty-eight of their own great ships
had been destroyed over three to every one they had
conquered while it lasted the attack had been fear-
ful they must have been glad that there were only

the largo doors in the sides of the ships opened and men equipped with individual flying wings strapped upon their backs stepped out of
the ships and flew down    the surface of that world was covered with the bodies of the intelligent creatures who had inhabited it
they looked like giant hairy tarantulas over a hundred timcslarger than the largest tarantula that ever existed on earth

a few if they had not struck first their loss would
have been much greater they did not know what
lay ahead of them nor of the yellow forces with com-
mander ureena at the head bent upon vengeance

  the spheres again stopped their whirling forward
motion they had hardly got under way after their
terrific encounter with the eleven who had gone for-
ward to investigate when in front of them appeared
a solid mass of those long slender ships of space well
did they pause they had met with only eleven out
there and destroyed them but in destroying them they
had lost thirty-eight of their own colossal ships but
now in front of them appeared thousands and there
was something in the way of their coming that
breathed murderous hostility

  the creatures who operated those spheres must have
reasoned that retreat was the better part of valor if
there had only been a few in front of them-well that
would have been different they turned and headed
at right angles the direction from which commander
ureena with her yellow quota would soon appear

  the men of the yellow legions were after them
with swiftly increasing speed the rest of the expe-
dition were also speeding up from their immense dis-
tances to lend their aid those globular ships of
space would certainly rue the day they had met with
the second great expedition

  again did the globular ships of space pause were
the whole heavens filled with those long slender ships
in front of them appeared the forces of the yellow
quota at one side hardly visible came the ships of
the white female quota while the black legions out
of sight followed

  they could not go forward and at their back
massed in solid formation came the ships carrying
the men again they made a quarter of a turn back
in the general direction of sirius from a full stop
they picked up their speed in an amazing fashion
their speed was great but not as great as the speed
which the long slender ships of the second great
expedition could attain

  commander ureena and her legions who now led
all the others in nearness to the spheres were slowly
overtaking them those in command of the spheres
realized it about one hundred of the globular ship
of space fell back behind the others and came to a
gradual stop to hold back the vengeful hosts of man
for a while from each of the spheres the lurid
flame with its accompanying bolts flashed from them
in a death-dealing stream the space in front of
the pursuing yellow quota was being strewn with
those ship destroying missiles ship after ship crumpled
up became partially incandescent and exploded

  from the long slender interstellar ships of the yel-
low quota at their heels the pale-yellow glow from
the egg-shaped thing in front of each ship began to
make its appearance they began to touch sphere
after sphere and enveloped them with their golden
glow-and then they were gone the fleet did slacken
its speed though all around them ship after ship met
bolts in headlong collision and were destroyed soon
were the hundred globular ships of space that had
sought to bar the avenging hosts of man annihilated
with renewed speed the earths ships were after the
rest

  the women officers of the yellow quota were mad
to destroy they held that death was far too good
for the creatures who were directly responsible for
the death of commander keelen and the others in
the first eleven ships

  two-thirds of the remaining spheres slackened their
speed in their headlong retreat to try to hold back the

ships from earth the globular ships of space drew
away from each other and formed a mighty barrier
then they began to blaze away with every weapon they
had they were fighting desperately now even as
cornered rats will fight valiantly against overwhelm-
ing odds the speed in which the hundred spheres
had been despatched showed all too plainly what was
in store for them yet they appeared willing to sacri-
fice themselves so that a few might escape

  man was not having it all his own way though
the pale-yellow glow destroyed sphere after sphere and
their cannon riddled ship after ship their long slender
interstellar ships met the bolts and were destroyed by
the hundreds in the eagerness that the women of
the yellow quota were to get at them they were even
colliding with each other that region was swiftly
becoming a whirling mass of flying metal of ihstroyed
ships one by one the spheres met their doom the
wall of spheres held up the second great expedition
for some time

  after wiping out all those who had sought to bar
their way the expedition looked around to reek their
vengeance upon the rest but there was no sign of
them even their delicate instrument could not de-
tect them they had disappeared

  the ships of each zone resumed some semblance of
order the yellow forces being in the forefront were
hit the hardest rolls were called commander ureenas
ship did not answer her ship had been struck early
two hundred and forty-one ships carrying two mil-
lion four hundred and ten thousand human beings had
been destroyed

  after two temporary leaders were chosen to lead
the yellow forces the second great expedition resumed
its way toward the ringed world that circled bright
sirius and its fainter companion

  time passed swiftly the members of the expe-
dition were wiser now the belief in the emptiness
of space was discarded an intense vigilance was
being kept they would not be caught napping a
second time nor would they foolishly approach any
body traveling through space at a safe distance
they could use their pale-yellow glow of destruction
to remove it from their path

  sirius now lit up the void of space with its white
glow the small dense companion of sirius stood
out faintly when shielded from its white rays some
of the larger planets would soon be made out also
two more months and their long hazardous journey
would be at an end the more dangerous task of
landing upon that ringed world and subduing its in-
habitants was yet before them

  in front of the expedition without the slightest
warning there suddenly flashed a score or so of the
globular ships of space they were very small not
more than one hundred feet in diameter and ex-
tremely swift two of their number turned and
headed for sirius the rest kept on the course they
had been traveling before they flashed across the sight
of the expedition twenty ships gave chase but the
tiny spheres outdistanced them easily more and more
of the tiny spheres appeared they made no move
to attack they were watching the expedition as it ap-
proached speed was their only defense they out-
distanced the pale-yellow glow some were cornered
and destroyed the rest sped back to their world to
warn them of the immense force that was approaching

  scouts were thrown out far ahead of the expedi-
tion the ships came closer together they were ready
for anything nothing happened

  another month passed a jumbled indistinct warn-
ing was received by man to halt a ship one of their
the second swarm



scouts came hurtling back fast upon the heels of
the message it had sent to warn the expedition that
many thousands of those huge globular ships that they
had met and defeated out in the void between the
solar system and sirius were heading straight for the
expedition their number was legion

  the expedition came to a gradual stop they spread
out far and wide the forefront of each ship opened
and the egg-shaped object from which the pale-yellow
glow emanated stood forth the four circular holes
farther back in each ship were also in evidence they
would get a royal welcome

  from the scouts still far in the front of the main
force came word that the globular ships of space were
attended by millions of tiny spheres the scouts were
retreating in front of them as fast as they could
no lurid lame with its accompanying bolt had yet
been shot from the spheres

  a day-twenty-four hours-passed the defenders
were drawing near to where the second great expe-
dition lay motionless in space they were coming to
give battle in the great telescopes aboard each long
interstellar ship of the expedition they could just be
made out their speed was slackening

  they were almost within the utmost limit of the
range of the pale-yellow glow when at the very last
moment they stopped turned and fled back in the
direction from which they had come not one of their
missiles was shot at the expedition that lay awaiting
them motionless in space the original intention of
those in the spheres had probably been to hold off the
invading forces from earth and do battle with them
far from their own world

  the six commanders thinking that it was some kind
of a trap ordered the ships to move cautiously for-
ward with their weapons they were confident to
cope with any surprise they might encounter more
scouts were thrown ahead

  countless hours passed the officers stuck to their
posts fatigue was forgotten time was forgotten
the discomforts of the body were forgotten the
ringed planet could be made out at last those at
the eye-pieces of the telescopes saw thousands of the
huge globular ships of space separate themselves from
the ring of moonlets that circled that world and leave
its neighborhood going in the opposite direction from
which the expedition were approaching they seemed
to be abandoning their world they preferred retreat
rather than to stay and face the second great expe-
dition the survivors of those they had met out in
the void of space must have returned with terrible
tales a lesson in warfare had been taught to them
which they could not forget

  the expedition made no move to follow the spheres
which were leaving the vicinity of sirius the ships
of the expedition came closer and closer searching the
surface of that world for any suspicious sign through
their powerful telescopes they scrutinized the surface
of that world most minutely when satisfied that there
could be no trap half of the officers of each ship
went into the large chambers where the rank and
file of the expedition lay in the state of suspended
animation and began to inject the antidote to the
drugs which had caused the condition that so closely
resembled death

  the people who had lain down healthy and over-
weight were now as gaunt as skeletons they could
not rise from their bunks or even lift their arms
for days they had to be fed and cared for before
they could move weakly about the interstellar ships
meanwhile hung poised some distance from the planet

  some regained their strength faster than others and

were able to help the officers many had a relapse
and died their systems unable to stand the antidote
which was a very powerful drug those who re-
covered grew stronger and at last completely re-
covered

  the thousands of interstellar ships from earth drew
closer to the ringed world just outside of the atmos-
phere they circled it very slowly they entered into the
atmosphere from any spot on the surface of that
world the inhabitants could see one or two inter-
stellar ships sinking toward them they were doomed
telescopes pointing downward showed the creatures
of that world moving about feverishly the interstellar
ships sank still lower

  at various points of that world thousands of tiny
ships of air rose and started firing their weapons at
the ships from earth the great guns at the forward
end of each interstellar ship destroyed them more
rose and they in turn were destroyed guns roared
from below bombs were dropped wiping out the
guns at last silence reigned no more tiny ships
rose no more guns roared at the invadei- all activity
in the cities ceased for forty-eight hours the second
great expedition hung menacing above the surface of
that ringed world waiting

  the interstellar ships dropped down until they were
only two miles above the surface the large doors
in the sides of the ships opened and men equipped
with individual flying wings strapped upon their backs
stepped out of the ships and flew down in a wide
strap around their waists they carried a score of tiny
but extremely powerful bombs they were the rank
and file of the expedition and fluttered down like a
plague of locusts destroying everything

  when satisfied that no living thing remained upon
that world they began to explore the wrecked cities
of the former owners every one was eager to stretch
his legs upon solid ground once again

  the surface of that world was covered with the
bodies of the intelligent creatures who had inhabited
it on earth there were creatures who resembled them
a little the inhabitants looked like giant hairy taran-
tulas over a hundred times larger than the largest
tarantula that ever existed on earth there was not
one living spider-like creature to be found though
there were countless millions of them in various stages
of putrefaction strewn along the thoroughfares of
their queer cities millions of them it was found had
killed themselves long before the rank and file started
dropping their bombs

  realizing his mistake too late man searched in every
nook and cranny of that world in the hope of finding
some of them alive their civilization was great and
much could have been learned from them they found
books composed of thin metal plates covered with
strange script men and women were set to the task
of deciphering them

  meanwhile the men and women were clearing those
strange cities away and plowing under the surface of
that world probably the first time its surface ever
felt the plow and getting ready to plant the seeds
which they had brought with them

  the men and women who were set to work to de-
cipher the books found the key the whole history
of the conquered world was being rapidly unfolded to
man he found that those intelligent spiders were
equal to him in intelligence in metal working and
various sciences they were even ahead of him

  in some of the older records it told of the first
two interstellar ships which came to their world and
how the crew was destroyed then it told farther on
how the ten who had come seeking the two had been


amazing stories quarterly

lured down from their great height and destroyed by
using the first two ships as a decoy then it told
how they learned the secret of interstellar travel
from the interstellar ships they had brought down
with that knowledge they built small ships and visited
the small moonlets that composed the ring around their
world they hollowed the interior of some of the
moonleta and fitted in a driving mechanism similar to
the driving mechanism of the long slender vehicles
that had come to them from another world they
too were going to visit other worlds

  in other records of a later date it was learned that
the spider-like creatures were making preparations to
invade distant worlds that circled a yellow dwarf star
that was but nine light years away-our sun the
hundreds of huge globular ships-larger hollowed out
moonlets equipped with a powerful driving mechanism
of rays-that the expedition had met and all but de-

stroyed in the open void of space between sirius and
the solar system were but the first vanguard of the
invaders

  the second great expedition was just in time

  after the second crop was harvested and everything
going well on the ringed world the leaders sent four
hundred of the long interstellar ships back to earth
to return with live stock they were desperately in need
of many thousands of animals could be brought back
with the aid of the drugs inducing the state of sus-
pended animation

  when the men returned to earth thirty-one years
after they had first started out with the expedition
they found the inhabitants of the three zones busily
engaged in planning the third great expedition a
greater expedition than those preceding it scheduled
to start a thousand years hence

                 the end

a modern atlantis

   by frederick arthur hodge

               continued from 

under any circumstances be seen he led the group
down the ramp into the palm garden where he told
them the dramatic story of the past week on the isle-
port of holdens wound of the death of the spy
and of the final defeat of the european alliance an
internationally famed reporter for the associated press
requested and obtained access to the wireless room
from which the story was sent to the waiting press
of america and the world

  an army surgeon and nurses had come with one of
the planes and immediately upon his arrival was con-
ducted to the bedside of the wounded man after a
careful examination he warmly commended miss crom-
well and jerry scott for their work the wound had
been thoroughly disinfected and showed every indica-
tion of healing but the fever that was due to the
shock and exposure and all they could do would be to
assist fiature to this end he devoted all his attention
and skill but he foresaw that it would take many days
possibly weeks before the fever could be thrown off
meantime the patient must have absolute quiet and
careful nursing he wanted to send for another nurse
to assist in the work but kitty cromwell would not
hear of it and the surgeon who had acquired much
wisdom beyond that which he had learned from books
yielded to her bulletins were sent out daily concern-
ing holdens condition and in the busy marts of trade
and the homes of a thankful people they were awaited
with hope and scanned with thanksgiving that at least
there was no change for the worse and day by day
the fever was expending itself and the hopes for recov-
ery grew stronger

  late on the day following the arrival of the air-
planes a fleet of fast cruisers arrived off the isleport
a boat was lowered and conveyed a rear admiral to
the structure where he was received by jerry scott on
the lower deck the fleet had already picked up the
story sent from the isleport and the admiral came to
pay his respects to holden through his companions and
to offer them any service that might be within the
power of the government to bestow a conference was

held in the palm garden at which it was decided to
send to the isleport a guard of marines together with
wireless operators mechanicians a chef and assistants
the medical force was augmented by two more naval
surgeons in the morning the fleet would return leav-
ing one battle cruiser to cruise around in the vicinity
of the isleport two airplanes were also to remain with
them

  with the disposition of forces completed the ad-
miral surgeons and others remained in quiet con-
verse in the garden until long after night had fallen
jerry scott was asked concerning many details of the
battle all of which he answered in a manner that re-
flected the credit for the entire defense upon his friend
and miss cromwell but he firmly refused all sug-
gestions to show his visitors the apparatus that had
wrought the destruction that he said was a matter
solely for bob holden to decide

  the days passed slowly and stretched themselves into
weeks on the isleport matters had settled into a daily
routine as they waited for the fever to wear itself out
radio messeges expressing wishes for holdens recov-
ery were received by the thousand from public of-
ficials all over the world the trans-atlantic airplane
service inc asked jerry scott to take full charge of
their interests on the isleport during holdens illness
and he soon found himself flooded with a multitude of
details that made the time pass more rapidly but he
never remained away from holdens bedside for very
long intervals especially after the crisis had passed and
his friend was able to listen to him as he talked

october had come and over atlantis lay the peace-
ful haze of indian summer the fever that had
for so long held sway in holdens body and brain had
finally spent itself but it had taken fearful toll of his
once athletic figure the will to live the intensity of
his desire and the incessant care of kitty cromwell
aided by the united skill of his physicians had at last
triumphed then had come days of recuperation each
day adding visibly to his strength finally came the
a modern atlantis



day when he asked to be wheeled out into the palm
garden there was an understanding light in the eyes
of both holden and his nurse as they talked together
beneath the waving branches and the sunlight made
moving delicate patterns of the palm leaves which
chased each other across the steamer robe that pro-
tected him from the bracing october air the fall
flowers flaunted their gaudy colors on every grassy
bank it was the season when life finds its deepest
happiest significance

  jerry scott wandered about the isleport he could
not blind himself to the love that had come to crown
the lives of his two best friends and the knowledge of
what it meant to both of them would forever seal
within him the vision of a hope which had twice been
shattered his walk finally brought him to where they
were sitting and in response to a call from kitty
cromwell he joined them

  jerry said bob i have always wanted to ask you
where you and kitty had known each other before that
day when you met in the circular room

  jerry looked at kitty cromwell who nodded her as-
sent then he said you remember one winters night
in  at the harvard club when i read from a
newspaper about jack rutherford

  kitty cromwell flinched as if she had been struck
turned pale and looked furtively from one to the other

  then said holden slowly as he raised himself in
his chair what you are trying to tell me is that kitty
is jacks wife

  not is but was jack shot himself soon afterwards

i	went out there to his home to find her but she had
disappeared i hunted everywhere-

  but kitty cromwell had fainted

  quickly scott ran and brought water from the foun-

tain to bathe her face but when he returned she was
already recovering

  i did not know she said in a whisper

  on that night at the harvard club resumed jerry
i was overwrought when i read that item in the
paper and to a few friends bob among them i told
the story of that day in the argonne of you-and
jack-and of the hell that war had brought in your
lives i know that jack didnt do it it was war that
did it

  he paused and they saw how deeply he was moved
but soon he looked up at them and smiled as he re-
sumed

  well bob took a pledge that night although he had
never seen you kitty i have it here he produced
a small book from his pocket and opened it in honor
of this woman who has given so much i pledge myself
and whatever i can do to the abolition of war and
we all drank a toast that night to the abolition of
war

  he arose and taking a hand of each in his own
placed them together as he said bob has fulfilled his
pledge then he turned and left them
