r story of wild west hdventure

                    by the author of buffalo bill

chapter i

the chiefs oath

  dave life is worth a good deal to me whether it is to
you or not for i want to live for those i love

  thus spoke buffalo bill the famous american scout
to his bosom friend and long-time mate in many a wild
hunt dave estes as they looked eastward from a peak
in the great wind river gap of the rocky mountains
for they were in the heart of the northwestern hunting
grounds of the sioux nation

  the two scouts well-mounted ahd well-armed had
come thus far alone into this dreaded range to satisfy
themselves on two points-one a rumor that placer gold
was wondrously plentiful in the deep gulches of the wind
river mountains-the other that for bear elk moun-
tain sheep and antejope this was a hunters paradise

  they had learned that the rumors bad good foundation
they had prospected for and found fine gold in the black
sand in small nuggets and in quartzf ledges as to
game they could have fed a brigade and not worried
themselves in doing it

  what are vou growlin about bill said dave in
                    c

reply the reds are all off on the plains and weve got
the hills all to ourselves weve seen a heap of new
ground on this scout and id like to look a little farther
lets stay out one day longer

  you said the same thing two days ago dave said
bill yet here we are a days ride nearer to sunset now
than we were then you never tire on a scout good
reason why-you are at all the home you have wherever
you camp but it isnt so with me therere heart-
strings pulling me toward home where my loved ones
are

  just so this getting married ruins a man for scout-
ing and plains life it takes the game out of him
look here dave step light or youll wake me up
cried bill and the anger light flashed from his eyes
im as game now as i ever was and you know it or you
ought to who saved your hair when you were dowrr
and the sioux crowding for you like a pack of starved
wolves 

  you bill--you and god bless you for it

  and wasnt i married then-a husband and a
father

  yes bill and i take back all that i said but i was

the buffalo bull stories

  never in such a game country as this before and theres
  just one range id like to look at to-day and then im
  willing to go back

    if you are bent on a scout to-day dont go far and
  be in camp early ill take the horses down and pack
  our specimens and have supper ready when you come

    all right said dave dismounting im going
  where horses cant travel-up that gulch we looked at
  yesterday

    the scout a small agile wiry man left buffalo bill
  to return while lie shouldering his spcncer rifle took a
  coiirse along the ridge

     bill called to the well-trained horse of his mate to fol-
  low and turned powder face his own favorite steed
  in the direction of their camp which had been pitched
  in a little valley near a small lake

    he rode leisurely along a henry rifle slung at the
  rear of his saddle but with his favorite needle-gun over
  his shoulder ready for instant use

    meat was plenty in camp so he left the game in sight
  unmolested

    but a sight met his eye that made him draw his horses
  close in cover under a clump of dwarf pines where he
  could see without being seen

    he saw coming through the valley from the east
  three figures on horseback riding at a terrific pace

    he quickly got his fieldgiass into focus and by its aid
  discovered the riders

    two rode side by side several yards in advance of the
  third

    of these the first was an armed indian warrior and he
  led the second horse which bore an indian girl who
  seemed to be bound to the horse which the warrior led

    the third rider so far in the rear was also an armed
  indian warrior and he was lashing his horse furiously
  as the first also lashed his

     a race for life it looks like said buffalo bill but
  i see no sign of any pursuer if that was a white woman
  id take a hand in mighty sudden if it is an abduction
  why its their business not mine

    the first warrior and the squaw dashed on through the
  gap while just as bill reached the ipvel the horse of
  the other warrior fell throwing its rider heavily against
  a huge bowlder and leaving him senseless on the
  ground

    bill rode up thinking from the way he lay that the
  indian had fractured his skull or broken his neck but
  he found him conscious as he halted by his side though
  he was unable to rise

    paleface i know you you are long rifle the great
  killer of buffalo said the indian as bill reined in his
  horse

    yes said bill quietly what is the matter with
 you

    heap bad is the matter me got an arm and leg
  broke-my horse most dead and yellow bear the black
  foot chief has gone beyond my reach with dove eye
  my daughter the red rose of my tribe

    dove eye then you are spotted tail the great
  war chief of the big horn sioux

    yes i am spotted tail kill me if you like i have
  taken scalps enough to line my lodge

    killing cripples isnt in my line said bill but

 ill ijiake a bargain with you spotted tail if youll
 agree to keep peace with all palefaces who come here to
 hunt and look for gold ill get dove eye back and
 bring you the scalp of yellow bear will you agree to
 this

   long rifle i will

   swear it by the great spirit

   i swear to be a friend to the palefaces if dove eye
 is saved from yellow bear the black foot

   enough crawl to my camp where youll find meat
and drink said bill and loosing daves horse he
turned powder face on the trail of yellow bear

chapter ii

the scouts best shot

   a handsome indian woman is a rarity but the daugh-
 ter of spotted tail dove eye womanly graceful
 though but fifteen was an exception on all the plains
 through the black hills and in the great mountains
 she was known as the red rose of the sioux nation as
 the most beautiful of indian girls

   already warriors of her own tribe had fought in jeal-
 ous rivalry to gain a friendly glance from her eyes al-
 ready her father had been asked for her hand by some
 of the bravest and richest chiefs of his and other tribes
 but his answer was

   dove eye is the heart of spotted tail-he cannot
part with his child

   yellow bear a dreaded chief of the black fpet a tribe
 at war with all abound them had not asked her parents
 or herself for her hand with a great hunters stealth he
 had crept into the village of her father when almost
 all the tribe were away on a buffalo hunt and that father
 was detained by sickness in his lodge and with a daring
 peculiar to him and his tribe had seized and borne her
 away bound on a captured horse

   spotted tail sick though he was hadfollowed swiftly
 on the trail and had come almost within rifle shot of
 yellow bear when his horse fell	

   the black foot chief saw the mishap and he rode on
 more leisurely to save his horses for the long journey
 yet before him for he did not see buffalo bill riding
 down toward his fallen pursuer

   the girl looked back and a cry of joy broke from her
 lips he saw that a pursuer was nearer than before
 and she thought none but her father was on the trail

   yellow bear turned his eyes and he saw that it was
 not spotted tail but a well-armed and well-mounted
 paleface who was coaling swiftly on his track

  quickly he lathed his horse and that which bore
dove eye into funous speed once more-dangerous
speed indeed for the fough route he was passing oyer
grew rougher and more narrow as they ascended the
pass but there was a danger behind which the black
foot could comprehend for he had battled with pale-
faces before

   nearer and nearer the pursuer came and a low scorn-
 ful laugh broke from the lips of dove eye or she
 deemed her rescue sure now

   yellow bear heard it and his anger flamed up and he
  resolved that she should first die and then he would face
 his pursuer
the buffalo bill stories



  checking his horse suddenly he clutched her round
arm and raising her form so as to bring her heart full
before him he raised his arm to drive the knife in her
bosom	

   as he thus raised his arm a terrible yell broke from
his lips-a cry of defiance and hate

   dove eye fearless and full of scorn looked him de-
fiantly in theface expecting instant death but suddenly
his arm fell and the knife dropped to the earth for buf-
falo bill fully one hundred yards away saw her peril
raised his rifle quick as thought fired and sent the ball
through the upraised right arm

   yellow bear helpless to use knife or rifle now uttered
a scream of baffled rage and pain then leaping from his
horse he plunged off into a micket where no horseman
could follow him just as buffalo bill dashed up to finish
the work begun by the best shot he ever made

   dove eye is safe he said as he reined his horse
back to its haunches and cut the thongs which bound
her her father is at my camp waiting for her
dove eye thanks the brave paleface her life has
been saved by him and she will be his friend forever
buffalo bill needs no thanks said the heroic scout
but look to his horse he promised to take your
father back a scalp and he must get it

   bill threw the reins of his horse into the hands of the
liberated maiden and sprang into the thicket after
yellow bear

   dove eye saw the form of her preserver disappear and
her eyes gleamed with a new light

  he is brave as the bravest she said doveeye
will be his slave

   she waited minutes and they seemed long for him to
return and then almost an hour passed before buffalo
bill came back

 when he did return he looked flushed and angry

   he can outrun a crippled wild turkey and hide better
thah a chick-pheasant ive lost him and his trail but
ill have his scalp yet and keep my word with spotted
tail

  dove eye did not speak she never dared to speak
to her father when his brow wore the anger cloud and
she thought she must be silent when the brave paleface
was angry

  we will go to the camp where your father is she
jowed her head and turned her horse while bill se-
cured the other horse so that the black foot chief could
not find him and remount

   buffalo bill now led the way down the pass closely
followed by dove eye whose eyes watched with admira-
tion every movement of his manly graceful form

   there is no warrior like him in all the tribes she
murmured as she rode on dove eye must win his
love

chapter iii

the little scout in love

  when buffalo bill leading the captured horse de-
serted by yellow bear and followed by dove eye rode
jjack to where he had left spotted tail he found the
thief seated on the ground near his dead horse for the
rnimal had literally run on until its life gave out

  a gleam of satisfaction brightened the eyes of spotted
tail as he saw his daughter free and unharmed then his
eyes looked to the belt of buffalo bill for the scalp which
the latter had promised

  the scout knew why he looked and said

  yellow bear crippled by a ball from my rifle got
away i could not take his scalp this time but i have
given my word i never break it you shall yet have
that scalp there is his horse in place of your own
long rifle is a great brave he has brought dove
eye back to her father and spotted tail for this will
keep peace between his band and the paleface when
his arm and leg get so he can use them he will hunt for
the scalp of yellow bear himself but now he must
be taken back to his own people for he is no good with
these broken bones it is but a days ride to the lands
of the black feet and yellow bear will get to his peo-
ple and it may be come back to try and steal dove eye
again and take the scalp of her father

  a days ride only then that smoke means some-
thing said buffalo bill as a white pillar made by the
burning of moss rose toward the sky away in the north-
west

  yes yellow bear is speaking to the eyes of his
people make my broken leg and arm straight be-
tween pieces of wood and put me on the horse soon
for if we stay here we will have the black feet like
hungry wolves upon us if they come before i am ready
take dove eye and go she must never be taken by
yellow bear

  she never will be said the beautiful girl and she
knelt down by his side to aid buffalo bill to set the
broken bones and secure them in the splints

  with such skill as men brought up on the plains al-
most invariably possess the hunter proceeded to place
the broken linibs in proper position and then with the
long silken scarf which he wore cut into strips he
bound the splints in place

  dove eye calmly aided in the work

  indian nature may be human nature but one who has
seen how they can endure pain rather doubts it

  as soon as the surgical job was over buffalo bill as-
sisted the sioux chief up on the horse which yellow bear
had left and then the three rode down to the camp

  why does long rifle stop here asked spotted tail
as buffalo bill came to the camp

  because i have a mate up in the hills who will not
come in till night said bill i cant desert him
long rifle is right to be true to his friend but the
black feet will be on our trail before another sun is up
then some of em will have a free pass to the happy
hunting ground above said buffalo bill in his quiet
way

  let my brother make three smokes a rifle shot
apart white like that said spotted tail if any hunt-
ers or warriors of my tribe see them they will not let
their horses rest until they are with their chief does
long rifle know how to make the white smoke

  and the chief pointed to the pillar of smoke in the
northwest

  i will make the smokes while dove eye cooks mat
for her father there is plenty there

  the hunter pointed to birds venison and fish all


the buffalo bill stories

hanging to branches near his camp-fire and then he tore
a large lot of moss from the trees near at hand mounted
his horse and rode away to make the smoke signal

  soon spotted tail saw three white pillars going up in
the still air and he hoped they might be seen by some
of his braves

  dove eye while the scout was gone on his errand
with the ready tact of a forest-born maiden stirred up
the embers of the camp-fire and placed meat fowls and
fish before the coals on the forked sticks which had
been used for that purpose before then she peeled bark
for platters for she had seen palefaces use plates and
she wished to do all she could to please the brave mail
who had rescued her

  buffalo bill smiled when he saw not only how nicely
she had cooked the meat but how neatly it was laid
upon bark plates and he said

  dove eye knows how to keep a lodge

  the girl knew he spoke in compliment his pleased
looks told that

  will long rifle and my father eat she asked

  we will dove eye and so must you for you need
it as much as we

  dove eye will wait till her father and his friend are
done then she will eat

  buffalo bill knew what indian customs were too well
to try to persuade her against them and he joined
spotted tail in a hearty meal

  when her father and the hunter had finished dove
eye showed that the late perils she had passed through
had not lessened her hunger for she ate heartily

  suddenly the sound of footsteps aroused the attention
of buffalo bill who had been looking dreamily into the
fire on which dove eye had just thrown her dinner
plates

  the eyes of the scout rested on dave estes who had
come suddenly into camp and now stood transfixed with
wonder gazing intently at dove eye who in turn
glanced at him seeming to measure him from head to
foot

  glad youre back dave for well find these hot
quarters before long if we stay said buffalo bill

  wheres that red angel dropped- from  asked dave
still gazing at dove eye

  dave had never seen so handsome an indian girl as
she was

  buffalo bill laughed as he answered

  the girl is dove eye the daughter of the great
sioux war chief spotted tail who lies there with a
broken leg and arm weve got to see them back safe
to their village

  im in for that but how did she come here  what
a beauty she is does she understand english

  as well as you as ycnl can see by the smile on her
face she was stolen away from her father by yellow
bear a black foot chief and her father broke down here
in the chase i made a bargain with him to keep peace
and then took the trail got within shot of the black
foot and winged him by that i got her back safe and
here she is

  bill youre a mean cuss why didnt you let me
save the gaj cried dave

  why werent you on hand so as to take my chance

you were bent on prospecting you know and that tookj
you out of the way

  cuss the luck id rather do her a favor than the 
best-born lady she is prettier than any picture i ever 
saw

  dave youre in love

  i know it bill and if she doesnt love me it shant
be my fault

  these latter expressions were uttered in a tone too low
for dove eye to hear them for she had turned away from
the too ardent gaze of the young scout

  spotted tail now spoke addressing buffalo bill
since the friend of long rifle has come back would
it not be better that we travel before the sun goes out
of sight the black feet may be near to answer the
signal of yellow bear

  yes said buffalo bill as soon as my mate gets
a bite to eat we will start

  meat here all ready said dove eye producing the
store she had laid away

  ill eat as i ride said dave start as soon as you
like we can make twienty miles afore dark

  little brave has a good heart me like him he is
a brother to long rifle  said dove eye pleased at the
readiness to go which dave estes exhibited

  not a brother but a mighty good partner said buf-
falo bill he isnt much on sire but he is keener than
a whipsnake in a fight and worse than a wolf on a
hunt 

  dave heard the words of the girl and he sprang to
get the horses ready for he had an idea he would win
her even if jie had no hand in her rescue

  does she know youre married bill asked dave in
a low tone looking back at the girl as she caught her
own horse

  not that i know of but you neednt fear for me i
think well have enough to think of to save our scalps
before we are out of this help me to get spotted tail
on his horse as easy as we can and then well be off
the sioux chief was in a bad fix to ride but he knew
that life depended on his getting out of that vicinity and
he bore his pain without a murmur when the two scouts
lifted him into the saddle and secured him so he would
not fall if pain or weakness should overcome him

  dove eye arranged her own saddle and was mounted
before dave could offer assistance

  with her usual forethought she cut a quarter of veni-
son loose from the branch on which it hung so that
when they next halted there would be no necessity to kill
meat

  what a queen wife shed make for a hunter and trap-
per said dave as he took note of her action bill
im gone in i never thought a red could take me but
im her prisoner for life

  buffalo bill smiled at this declaration from dave for
the young scout had hitherto seemed rather averse to
the female sex

  which course shall we take asked bill speaking
to spotted tail

  go straight for sunrise said the chief if we get
to the big horn before the black feet are on our trail
we will get soon where they may lose their scalps
buffalo bill took the lead spotted tail rode next
the buffalo bill stories



dove eye followed him and dave estes brought up the
rear at iris own wish

  it was late in the day when they started but the
horses were rested and moved on at that pace so natural
to the prairie horse-an easy lope

  night was closing in when bill came to a sudden halt
he saw as they rounded a point of thick forest near
the river bank a camp close ahead-whether of red or
white men he could not tell

chapter iv

signal for aid

  a hundred lodges ranged on either side of a brook
where it ran slowly through a valley told of the power of
yellow bear this was his own village and the occu-
pants of these lodges were but a small part of his war-
like tribe

  prominent among the lodges was the large one in
which he dwelt when in the village and before it on a
tall lance floated a yellow cloth with a bear rudely
drawn on it

  there were many warriors idling in groups while
women were busy about the camp-fires

  a large drove of horses fed in the valley watched by
a party of half-grown boys

  suddenly a woman tall in stature in a headdress of
feathers with a robe of rich scarlet cloth about her form
came out from the lodge of the chief

  she was not a white woman yet her complexion was
very light for an indian

  her look was commanding though the freshness of
youth had left her

  close behind her came two other women-one an
old haggard creature with one eye gone while the other
shone like a ball of fire her coarse white hair hung
loose

  the other strangest of all was very young and a
white girl with rich curling hair of golden hue blue
eyes and regular features dressed in the indian style a
short skirt of cloth fringed with fur leggins and moc-
casins her head was bare only she wore the single
eagle feather whichtold her to be a chiefs daughter
and unmarried

  the tall woman stood for a moment outside of the
lodge of yellow bear then she turned to the young
girl and said

  wanda the queen of the black feet will now listen
to the dream of cindah- the sunflower then she will
ride to look for yellow bear her chief and the father
of cindah the sunflower

  he is not my father the spirit of dreams came to
me and told me that the skin of my father was white like
my own that i have a mother as beautiful as the flowers
i love

  the spirit of dreams has been speaking lies to cin-
dah the sunflower no father but yellow bear can
claim a smile from her nor shall any but wanda call her
daughter

  the one-eyed hag muttered something but neither
wanda nor the girl understood what she said

  the blue eyes of the young girl flashed out a haughty
look at the queenly-looking woman as she said

  the great spirit will not lie the dream spirit
must spak true words with a single tongue i have
heard yellow bear say that this is so

  yellow bear has said foolish things and he has
dreamed bad dreams he dreamed that he must go to
the land of his enemies to the hunting grounds of the
sioux to steal him a new wife it vas a bad dream i
told him be would come back as he went empty-handed
and he will were he to bring a strange wife here the
knife of wanda would drink her blood

  the young girl was about to speak when a warrior
who had been looking away to the southeast uttered a
shrill shout

  in an instant every one in the village was attracted
first toward him and then to a pillar of white smoke
which rose suddenly above the hilltops in that direction

  in silence they looked a few seconds ajjd then it went
out of sight

  then again the white column rose to view then it
faded away and a third time it came in sight

  wanda put her hand to her belt and took out a
whistle made from the tip of an antelopes horn this
she blew with a loud shrill call

  in a second the warriors were seen rushing to their
lodges to arm themselves while the guards in charge of
the horses drove the herd in where the animals could be
ready for use

  wanda herself disappeared inside of the large lodge
when she came out she was clad in a short skirt a
hunting-jacket of fur and with her limbs incased in leg-
gins while she carried a gun in her hand and wore a
knife and pistols in her belt

  as she came forth she cried

  yellow bear has called for help wanda will go at
the head of the bravest to answer his signal

  a yell broke from every lip as wanda spoke and a
young brave led a large cream-colored horse with mane
and tail of jet-black hue up for her use

  before she mounted wanda turned to the one-eyed
hag and said

kincatah keep thy one eye open cindah dreams
too much she is under thy care while we are gone
the old hag answered with a hoarse croaking voice
the sunflower will not go out of sight of kincatah 
wanda said no more but springing astride the noble
horse dashed off at a swift gallop

  the warriors in single column followed at the same
pace

  cindah gazed after them a moment and then re-en-
tered the lodge

  the one-eyed lisgf hobbled in after her

  an instant later a young brave came up in front of
the lodge and looking cautiously around to see whether
any one was near to notice his actions advanced to the
shield which hung on the center-pole and made three
marks upon it with a piece of charred coal

  then he uttered a cry like that made by a hawk and
hurried away

  he had not been gone a half minute when cindah
came hurriedly from the lodge glanced around then
looked at the shield

  a letter for me from the strange friend left in the
hollow tree she murmured as she looked at the marks
the buffalo bill stories

on the shield and she brushed them away with the palm
of her hand

 the one-eyed hag hobbled out and glared suspiciously
 at the girl

 what did the sunflower come out of the lodge so
 quickly for asked kincatah

 because she wanted to she i as free as the wind
 that whispers among the trees she will come and go as
 her will tells her to do

 not while wanda and yellow bear are away will the
 sunflower go out of sight of kincatah the one-eyed
 said the hag

 we will see cried cindah angrily

 she blew a small whistle made from a slender bone of
 an antelopes leg

 the call brought the young warrior who had made the
 marks on the shield

 red plume will saddle his horse and mine cindah
 wants to ride said the girl

 saddle a horse too for kincatah cried the old hag

 let it be one-eyed and lame like herself said cin-
 dah scornfully

 fool rain shall fall in a flood from your eyes for
 this screamed the hag

 cindah laughed to see her eye blaze in furious light
 while the young warrior hurried off to get the horses

chapter v
dave estes suspicions

 when buffalo bill made the sudden halt seeing a
 camp-fire so close he also cocked his gun for instant
 use for he was in rifle-shot of the strangers whoever
 they were

 dave estes rode to the front with his rifle ready
 while dove eye now carrying her fathers rifle rode
 up in a line with them

 white men and a rough-looking set said bill a
 moment later as about a dozen men sprang up from about
 the fire with guns in theif hands we may as well ride
 up and take things coolly for were in too close range to
 back out now

 so he rode boldly on while those in front calling to a
 couple of men to look out for the stock stepped up in
 front of their camp and waited for the scout and his
 party to come up

 they were not regular hunters and trappers though
 well armed

 road agents they might have been termed also

 they were in number fourteen and mostly men of
 middle age bearded and long-haired

 one only had a different look and he was the leader
 his dress was superior to the rest-a kind of velvet
 hunting coat reached below his hips while buckskin
 breeches met high calvary boots on which he wore a
 pair of silver mexican spurs

 his pistols were ornamented with silver mountings
 and his large hunting-knife was nearly as long as an
 artillery sword

 he was young with long black hair hanging in curls
 about his shoulders and with a smooth almost womanly
 face

 yet his dark sharp eye his firm close-set lips and his

 air of command told even before he spoke that he wss
 a person of firm and resolute nature and that he held the
 rest under control

   which way strangers he asked in a bold authori-
 tative tone

   we are bound east to the village of this wounded
 chief said buffalo bill pointing to spotted tail he
 holds his headquarters on the big horn if you know
 where that is

   i only know that it is down on a map i travel by
 said the other im new in these parts though ive been
 over the plains twice

   i should think you were new or youd be careful how
 you camped in the heart of a hostile indian country
 why youre two whites and are friendly with the
 indians or is the girl held captive by you

   no they are old friends because i did the chief fa-
 vors scalps would be in demand if you or i were met
 by any of his tribe or by the black feet

 theyd get more lead than hair from my party said
 the other as you cant go any further before night
 sets in camp and well treat you as well as we can
 buffalo bill did not like the looks of the party but it
 was best to keep on friendly terms with them if he could

   well camp near by you but weve meat along and
 need no help

   all right stranger said the young man then
 turning to his own men who crowded rather close he
 said  fall back to camp men-

   the men obeyed as under good discipline but dave
  estes noticed that they almost to a man gazed with looks
 of admiration on the indian girl

   buffalo bill rode on and about a couple of hundred
 yards above halted on the stream

   well pitch camp here and let our horses rest he
 said addressing spotted tail

   long rifle knows what is best spotted tail trusts
 long rifle and the little brave

   well take as good care of you as we know how
 said bill dismounting

   he now unfastened the chief from his horse and aided
 by dove eye who spread out blankets carefully laid
 him down under the branches of a tree and dave estes
 picketed the horses to grass close at hind gathered dry
 fuel and kindled a fire

   spotted tail spoke a word of warning about this but
 buffalo bill pointed to the other fire and to the full
 moon just up and said

   it will add to our comfort and not increase our dan-
 ger

   dove eye at onge began to cook supper ana buffalo
 bill took from his own stores some coffee and hung a
 small camp kettle full of water over the fire to boil

   while these preparations were going on the leader of
 the other party came over

    got all you want here  he asked

   yes-thank you-all we need said buffalo bill 
   youre an old hand in camp life

   yes born and brought up to it answered the other
 yet you use good language-have better manners
 than the trappers ive met before

   good manners like the measles arc easy caught
 ive been a great deal with educated men army officers
the buffalo btll stories



  and others said buffalo bill it is very easy to be a
 gentleman when one knows how	f

   what might your name be asked the stranger
 iveno reason to conceal it my fathers name was
 cody ive earned the name of buffalo bill 

   the stranger started

   you were born in kansas-t-your father was killed
 there i he said

   yes-by border ruffians ive wiped out the debt
 said buffalo bill grimly

   yes ive heard of you before said the stranger
 but i expected to see a different man-a giant in stature
 and a demon in looks

   buffalo bill smiled as he answered

   im oqjy harsh when it is forced on me since you
 know my name what might yours be 

   boyd-without any preface said the other i left
 that when i took command of that camp gang over
 there you can call me captain boyd for the little time
 we are likely to be together

   all right captain boyd- i may as well tell you that
 an early start on whatever route you mean to take and a
 care to hide your trail will most likely keep you out of a
 rjasty indian fight we expect a band of black feet af-
 ter us and shoukl they strike your trail theyd strike
 hard for your hair as well as yur horses and weapons
 thank you for the warning why do you expect they
 whl follow you

   because i rescued the daughter of spotted tail that
 wounded chief from yellow bear a leading black foot
 chief this morning i wounded him but he got away
 as soon as he can rally warriors for support hell come
 she is good looking for a squaw said the young
 captain carelessly but im not fond of women so i
 seldom cast a second glance at them theyre at the
 bottom of two-thirds of the troubles that men get into
 and i steer dear

   thats sensible muttered dave estes who-now came
 iri and joined the group i used todo it

   dove eye came from the fire inhere her meat had been
 cooking nicely atjd told lortg rifle as she invariably
 called buffalo bill that supper was ready

   join us captain boyd said buffalo bill in a cour-
 teous tone

   thank you-no i hay supped i came over to ask
 you about the country ahead and the best route for me
 to take

   come around after supper and ill tell you what i
 can

   what is he asked dave estes when the young
 leader went back to his men

   your eyes can tell you as well as mine can he
 doesnt say	

   by this time dove eye had her supper served on fresh
 bark plates and buffalo bill took off his hot coffee to
 add to her fare

   after supper buffalo bill was joined by captain boyd
 who came with the map he had been traveling by and for
 an hour or more the two talked about the country and
 the trails then boyd went to his camp and the scout
 lay down to sleep till the mid watch came on for he and
 dave had agreed to take turns ami stand guard

  the camp-fires had burned low and all was quiet when
dave estes woke buffalo bill to take his turn as sentinel

  do they keep any watch over there asked buffalo
bill glancing toward the other camp

  none that i can see nothing has moved but the
stock since ive been on watch

  such carelessness deserves to lose hair said the
scout

  youll not have over two hours sleep dave so drop
on your blanket at once

  dave lay down near the embers of the camp-fire while
bill went out to change the picket pins of his horses to
a fresh grazing ground

  on approaching powder face he found that animal
with his fore feet planted close together his head low-
bent till the nose was close to the ground and his ear
pointed toward the west

  buffalo bill had seen the animal in this position three
times before and he had each time learned a lesson
twice he had been attacked by indians before the dawn
and the third time a column of mounted troops making
a night march passed his camp before daylight

  so theres danger in the wind old boy said he to
the horse

  the animal with almost human intelligence raised its
head and glaring off in the moonlight snuffed the air

  buffalo bill did not pass these signs unheeded

  he at once took up the picket pins of all the horses and
led them in to camp dave estes was not yet asleep

  saddle up dave-saddle up i think theres danger
close at hand an hours earlier start will do no hurt at
any rate said buffalo bill in a low tone

  spotted tail and dove eye were awake in a second
more and buffalo bill without speaking his convictions
that an enemy was near said that he had made up his
mind to an early start

  in less than five minutes the four were mounted and
ready to move

   dave lead the way and keep in the shadow of the
timber cried buffalo bill i will overtake you in three
or four minutes

  why does long rifle stay behind asked spotted
tail

  to put out our fire and make a false trail said the
scout

  but he had another and nobler purpose while feeling
that danger was creeping up he could not go off and
leave the other party strangers though they were with
death creeping up to surprise them

  the moment dave rode on followed by spotted tail
and dove eye the scout turned toward the other camp

  the animal for a wonder seemed adverse to go it
seemed to feel that peril was close at hand and obstin-
ately tried to turn in the direction that the others
were going

  buffalo bill angry at its perverseness drove his spurs
deep in the flanks of the noble animal and it bounded
swiftly toward the camp of the strangers

  almost at the same instant the scout was made aware
of the danger which the animal strove to keep him out
of for as it bounded on it nearly leaped over an indian
who was creeping along in the grass and bill saw not
only this but a dozen more to his right and left and


the buffalo bill stgrie

knew then that a large band was surrounding the camp
of the sleepers

  to think and to act were with him one and the same
thing to insure the safety of dove eye spotted tail
and dave estes he would ride in an opposite direction
from that taken by them dash through the camp of the
sleeping strangers wake them to resistance and make
good his own escape up the river or by crossing it

   with a wild yell of warning firing right and left with
his revolver and sending two red men to their last
sleep he drove madly through the camp of captain boyd

  as he wtnt he shouted

  up and to arms the reds are all around you 

  the next he was aware that another horse was close
behind his and as he dashed forward over another line
of indians all now yelling and firing he turned and saw
that the indian girl dove eye had followed him and
was close by his side

  ride girl-ride as you never rode before he
shouted

  at the same instant he saw a dark mass of horsemen
directly in his front and by the spears bristling in the air
he knew that the main body of mounted indians were be-
fore him

  turn-turn and follow t he cried to dove eye and
he wheeled powder face directly to his left into the thick
willows which fringed the river bank

  dove eye turned as quickly as he did and the two
went crashing through the brush and in a few seconds
both horses were in the stream swimming for the other
shore

  meantime a terrible fire from the breech-loading guns
of the white party told that they had been aroused in
time to make a deadly resistance and the answering yells
and rapid shots of the indians indicated that it was a
battle-for life on the one side for scalps apd plunder
on the other

   the excitement favored buffalo bill and the indian girl
in their only plan to get away

   buffalo bill paused scarce a second after crossing he
only took time to change his needle-gun for the henry
rifle which hung at the back of his saddle so that he
could have more than one shot ready if pursued and said
in a low tone to dove eye

  keep close to me i shall keep under cover and fol-
low the river if they do not strike the trail of your
father and my mate we will join them below

  i will follow where long rifle leads said dove
eye

   ah what is that  cried buffalo bill an instant later
as a wild peculiar shout followed by a succession of
indian yells reached their ears

   spotted tail my father is a prisoner in the hands of
the black feet said dove eye mournfully i know his
cry she continued and i understand theirs he turned
to look for dove eye who could not help following long
rifle and he has been captured he is a big chief he
will die by the fire

   not if i can help it said buffalo bill as he checked
his horse

  you are but one you can do nothing said dove
eye sadly

  but i cant let the black feet have things all their

own way hear em yell theyve wiped cut or cap-
tured the party of white men for the firing has ceased
girl will you obey my wishes

   dove eye will do all he tells her to do

  then- dove eye ride while you can swiftly down the
river close under cover of the trees till you reach the
great bend below  ride directly toward the first peak
which you will see where the sun rises keep on and
stop as little as you can till you get to fort thompson
there you will find a young chief a paleface with long
hair like mine his name is general custer he has
warriors and horses and when he is told that i am in
trouble he will not rest till he reaches me now go for
i shall stay to watch the black feet and to try to save
your father

  the indian girl hesitated looked up pleadingly in his
face and said

  do not tell dove eye to go away from you

  alone i can hide and watch those demons and see x
where they go and what they mean to do dove eye
could not help me in this the black feet shall not take
me when dove eye comes back with the white war-
riors she will find talking papers in the camp we left yes-
terday and they will give news to the long-haired gen-
eral go now dove eye

  dove eye sighed hut she turned her horse down the
river and in a few seconds was out of sight

   buffalo bill now led his horse into the water id the edge
of the thicket and following the stream for several hun-
dred yards went up against the current so as to leave no
trail then at a spdt where the hard shelving rock would
receive no impression he led the hofse out secured him
in the thick grass near by and stood and listened to the
noise made on the other bank of the river by the in-
dians

  he soon became satisfied that they had several prison-
ers in hand and were looking for more he could hear
them riding up and down the stream and he felt sure
their search would be keen and enduring when dove
eye and he were not found if her trail was taken noth-
ing but the fleetness of her horse and its endurance could
save her for beyond the great bend she had an open coun-
try of at least a half days ride to cross where it was al-
most impossible to hide and equally impossible to avoid
leaving a trail as to himself buffalo bill knew his peril
but he had been too often in such scrapes to feel bad
about it

chapter vi

red tlumes trfifk

  anger fire shone in the eyes of cindah the sunflower
when the young indian warrior red plume was seen
bringing not only her horse and his own but another
animal noted for spirit and speed for the use of kin-
catah the one-eyed watch keeper over cindah

  hoi cried the old witch the sunflower sees how
red plume obeys her wishes look at the horse he
brings it is neither one-eyed nor lame cindah may
ride but kincatah rides with her

  cindah djd not answer as red plume led the horses
up but her looks told him of her displeasure

  kincatah should take her blanket it will be cold on
the hills said the warrior
the buffalo ll stories



  red puitre is good he cares for the feelings of the
ou said tle hag and she went into the lodge to get a
blanket

  why did red plume disobey me asked cindah an
grily as soon as the other was gone

  that she might be alone in her ride with red plume
said the young indian you will soon see why red
plume brought that horse for kincatah

  kincatah came out and red plume assisted her to
mount the horse which he had saddled and bridled for
her 

  the old hag put on a great many airs on receiving so
much attention and turned to cindah and said

  we are now ready red pume can wait on you

  at that instant red plume dextrously slipped one of
the broad pods of the prickly pear full of thorns under
the tail of the horse which kincatah rode

  cindah saw the action and as the horse darted away
with the old hag clinging to its back and tugging help-
lessly at the bridle she understood the intentions of red
plume

  cindah could hardly mount the horse which red plume
held for her for she was watching kincatah far off down
the valley as the horse madly rushed on stung by tor-
ture

  it was good in red plume to get that old witch out
of my way i hate her

  red plume will die to serve cindah

  red plume is very good but he must be careful and
not show that he cares for cindah yellow bear will
kill any one who looks on her with eyes of love as he did
the noble white captive whom he spared so long that he
might teach cindah how to read the speaking papers and
to write so that she could read the news to yellow bear
when he captured the mailbags of the palefaces does
not red plume remember

  yes the paletaced prisoner was killed by yellow
bear in his passion because the chief found him kneeling
at the feet of the sunflower

  yes said cindah with a sigh i was sorry though
i felt no love for him but this stranger who writes to
me i might love him

  why the sunflower has never seen him he is
a mystery like the sounds we hear in the forest

  the young indian spoke eagerly and seemed to wait
her answer with impatience

  the mystery is to me a delight she said he writes
and savs he loves me he telfs me that he has seen me
when i did not know that he was near and he will never
be far from me that he will watch over me if danger
should approach that he will read my wishes and carry
them out when i least expect it three letters all left
where i can find them have reached my hand and now i
go for the fourth had kincatah ridden with us i could
not have gotten it but  know i can trust red pmme
he has been my playfellow ever since i can remember
he will be true to the sunflower said the young in-
dian and though he may dare to love her he will not
be rash as was the paleface who lost his-life

  that paleface was your friend red plume

  yes he was my friend because i loved to serve the
sunflower but in his hour of doon red plume cqiild
not raise a hand or speak a word to save him the an-

ger of yellow bear is like that of the storm the light-
ning comes and kills before the warning is heard the
paleface died he left but two friends to mourn him
one was cindah the sunflower the other was red
plume

  true halt here red plume and watch while i go
on and see if there is a speaking paper in the hollow tree

  while red plume reined in his horse as she re-
quested the lovely girl rode on to an old tree blasted by
a thunderbolt years before and dead and leafless

  into a small hollow as high as she could reach she
thrust her hand and brought out a roll of white thin
bark

  this she unrolled it was full of writing done in a
plain hand so like that of her paleface teacher that she
could read it readily not only the writing but the lan-
guage was like his and she could have fancied that these
letters came from him had she not seen him perish with
her own eyes

  these letters were almost a transcript of such as he
liad written to her

  cindah sat motionless on her horse reading the letter
while the young warrior watched her it seemed strange
too that he by actions and words professing love him-
self should be pleased when he knew that she was read-
ing of love from another

  he was about to join her when he heard a crashing in
the underbrush and the next instant he saw the forms
of a score of warriors breaking through at wild speed
toward her

  he dashed forward to throw his body between her and
peril the sioux-the sioux

  armed only with a spear the young brave dashed on
while cindah apparently panic-stricken did not even
urge her horse into action until it was too late for as
she saw the lance of red plume broken and himself made
prisoner she found her own horse seized by a brace of
warriors while a chief by his dress and arms rode to
her side

  who is this he aaked in the shoshone tongue
she is dressed like the red maidens of the land but her
skin is white and her eyes are blue 

  she is your captive let him go said cindah
sadly and she pointed to red plume who was half
firmly between two warriors

  you ask for him and not for yourself he is not
your brother is he your husband

  no i ask nothing for myself i can die and that i
enough

  you are as beautiful as the red rose of the siou-r
nation whom we left far away on the banks of the big
horn we will take you there that you may see her

  i have seen her her name is dove eye but she is
not there where you left her i saw her last night she
was riding on a horse fast bound and yellow bear the
greaj chief of the black feet led the horse she was his
captive

  the sioux chief looked at cindah with a wondering
eye she spoke earnestly as if she really had seen the
indian maiden

  the white flower speaks strange words can she
say how dove eve looked

  i can her long hair flowed down her baok she


the buffalo bill stories

swept on but her great black eyes flashed like fire she
wore about her neck a string of blue beads and on her
wrists armlets of gold

  the sioux warriors listened in astonishment while the
white captive thus described one whom they knew so
well

  the white flower says she saw dove eye last
night

  yes the angel of dreams came to her with the pic-
ture in his hand she saw it plain but yellow bear has
not come home there is his village he claims me as
his child but the dream angel says i am not

   the sioux chief rode a little apart with all his warriors
except four left to guard cindah and red plume

  from time to time they looked upon her while they
talked but in their looks there was respect

  after a short time the young chief evidently a sub-
chief out on some independent scout rode back to the side
of cindah and said

  i am young beaver and the father of dove eye is
my chief if his daughter is in the hands of yellow
bear the white flower and the young black foot chief
must go with young beaver and remain in his hands
till we meet spotted tail our chief we will not hurt
you-but you must go

  cindah allowed the young chief to take the bridle of her
horse in his hand red plume rode next to her and
they skirted the hills and rode in the direction wanda
with her warriors had taken

  the party was too small to keep in the open valley
where it might lie discovered by a larger one and young
beaver was evidently a cautious warrior

  he rode on swiftly until night was close at hand and
then saw before him a well-watered valley where he could
find a good camping ground

  he halted seeing nothing to alarm him the young
chief dashed swiftly down the hillside with his braves and
captives

  reaching the valley they crossed at a gallop and en-
tered a grove of cotton-wood trees on the river bank

  young beaver leaped from his horse and turned to
cindah

  as he did so yells from fully one hundred warriors
broke upon his ears and before he and his braves had a
chance to raise a weapon many were stricken down in
death and the rest were captives

  they had ridden right into the ambush of those who
waited for them

chapter vii

buffalo bill in close quarters

  it was but a little while after buffalo bill had got pow-
der face stowed away in his new hiding place before it
became light enough for him to think he could make out
the movements of the indians if he was up in the top of
one of the trees which seemed by its height to overtop
the rest

  leaving his guns below and removing his hunting-
coat and belt he embraced the trunk of the tallest look-
ing cotton wood and soon reached the nearest branches

  it was darker up among the thick branches than he
thought it would be and he was certain he could not

distinguish things on the plains very clearty so fie iyoiild
wait and take things easy

  thicker grew the branches as he ascended but that
was all the better for him there would be less danger
of his being discovered from his lofty lookout

  he was almost to its top when he paused to rest again
and then he started for he heard a strange purring noie
close to him and he knew even without seeing it that
he was close to a panther and that most likely her young
were with her in the same tree

  buffalo bill wished then that he had at least brought his
knife and pistols with him

  he looked cautiously around and soon saw two great
balls of fire and then a lesser pair in advance of the first
and as he kept his eyes fixed in fhat direction he soon
saw the shape of the animals as they crouched on a limb
higher than that where he rested

  he could hear the purring noise made by the beast as
if to assure the young one of protection

  if he moved either to go higher or descend the animal
might take it as an aggressive action and pitch upon him
and he did not wish to risk a rough-and-tumble fight with
a panther up in a tree at least sixty or seventy feet from
the ground

  he kept his eyes fixed on the fiery orb of the larger
animal arid remained motionless waiting for daylight to
come for he knew that such beasts unless wounded will
not as a general thing face a human being in the light
of day

  al last the animal began to get uneasy it seemed to
desire to get between him and its cub

  buffalo bill felt the limbs shake with its great weight
as it crept on until it had passed on over the cub and was
almost up the trunk of the tree and certainly within
twice its length of hini

  here it stopped and rearing up against the trunk of the
tree scratched against the bark with its long claws as if
it would terrify its visitor

  buffalo bill was contented that it should use its claws
in that way as long as they did not come in contact with
his bark he could now see plainly the shape of his huge
antagonist and the animal reared up at its full height on
the branch and peered from behind the tree trunk at buf-
falo bill

  it was war now-but a strange war the human eye
against that of the beast buffalo bill knew well if his
glance wavered he was lost the animal would leap
upon him in a second if he but winked or lost the eye-
charm with which he held it

  thus for minutes the man and the panther stood then
the panther drew back very slowly still keeping its eye
on him until an intervening branch broke the spell

  then with a wild scream the panther leaped off into the
braches of another tree followed by its cab and buffalo
bill drawing a long breath said

  thank heaven twa about the worst scare of my
whole life

  the cry of the animal as it leaped from tree to tree
was heard farther and farther away and the hunter now
satisfied that his peril was over from that source at least
turned to see what the indians were doing
the buffalq bill stories



  he gave but one earnest look at a scene almost within
rifie shot and the said quickly

  ill stop that game if i die

chapter viii

a daring rescue

  when almost at the start spotted tail missed dove
eye from his side he halted and would not ride on
though dave estes surmising she had gone with buffalo
bill declared that the scout would take good care of her

  spotted tail was obstinate and would not go on without
her and the consequence was that both were surprised
and capturqd by the black feet

  on being brought back to the spot where captain
boyd and his party had camped dave was rejoiced not to
see either buffalo bill or dove eye there-neither did he
see their scalps though every man of boyds party but
the captain had been killed and scalped

  boyd spotted tail and dave estes appeared to be
their only prisoners

  a big fire was kindled at the camp when these were
brought together and then for the first time dave estes
knew into whose power he had fallen

  a chief past middle age tali and with his right arm
bound in splinters advanced to where spotted tail and
his captive companions stood

  chief of the sioux do you know me asked this chief
yes said spotted tail bitterly i know you you
are yellow bear the thief who stole my child my dove
eye away from me in the night like a coward but
long rifle broke the arm that would have slain her and
he has carried her back safe to her people

  it is a fie she is on the plains yet and my warriors
will take her trail when the sun comes up and she shall
be brought back to see her father die then she shall
be the wife of yellow bear

  never-you hollow-hearted cuss cried dave estes
as careless of life as spotted tail himself she is safe
with the best man that ever scalped a red

  what dog are you to bark so loud said the chief
angrily

  im a sworn brother of buffalo bill whose bite is
worse than my barkas that arm of yours can tell
ugh you are a brother to the paleface who took
dove eye from me good i will make you eat fire
pile in old cuss im not afeared of fire ive
scalped your sort and i reckon i can afford to go on
that

  who are you asked the chief to captain boyd
ni was captain of the men whom your warriors have
killed i am nothing now but your prisoner

  a friend of spotted tail

  no-i never saw him before

  what are you doing in tfhe hunting grounds of the
red men 

  passing over them from the great waters where the
sun sets to the big sea where it rises  have not warred
on the red man-why has he warred on me and mine 
because he hates the palefaces he would sweep
hem away as the red fire sweeps the grass from the
plains

  they are as many as the leaves on the trees they
are rooted like the pines in the mountains

  the red mans hate shall blast them if they are as
the leaves on the trees the fire of his anger shall bum
them if they be rooted like the pines in the mountains
yellow bear hates the palefaces he has the scalps
of many on his lodge poles he will have more the
young brave may get ready to sing his death song as
soon as he gets to the village of yellow bear he shall
go in company with spotted tail to the spirit land this
other dog shall die at sunrise

  all right old rooster said the dauntless scout the
sooner im out of your sight the better for my eyes
there is no love lost between us	x

  yelfow bear ordered several of his braves to plant a
stake in the open plain and to gather dry fagots so as to
have all ready for the torture

  meantime he had parties out in search of buffalo bill
and dove eye

  the torture post was soon set in the ground the wood
gathered and just at dawn of day dave estes who had
been tightly bound from the start was led to the spot

  the brave little scout showed no fear and replied to
the taunts and insults of the warriors in bitter scorn tell-
ing them that they were squaws he boasted of the
scalps he had taken and of the dead he had left of their
race for the wolves to feed upon he angered them so
much that they could hardly restrain themselves from
killing him on the spot

  indeed this was what the gallant young scout desired
a sudden sllot or blow to take him quickly beyond the
power of pain instead of the wild agony of death by
fire

  but yellow bear had spoken his doom-the braves held
back their weapons

  he was bound to the post and the light of coming day
grew stronger and stronger the sun would rise and
the torture would begin

  spotted tail looked with pride in the face of the young
hero while tears of pity fell from the eyes of captain
boyd

  dave paid no heed to either of these he was thinking
and hoping that dove eye and buffalo bill were beyond
the reach of those who were about to sacrifice him

  the warriors now formed a circle about the post and
began the dance of torture and the song of triumph one
brave stood near the dost with a lighted brand in his
hand and as the others circled around him he shook it be-
fore the face of the doomed captive

  brighter and brighter came the light the red reflection
from the sun so nearly up

  yellow bear now came into the circle his face ex-
pressed his hate and in a tone of bitterness he said
the dog who is a brother to long rifle is about to
roast in the fire which the black feet will kindle

  ill burn clear and go up like the svnt bright and
shining cried the scout burn away-burn away and
dont spend a year in talking about it

  the father of light is rising said the chid siernly
let the fire drink the blood of the paleface dog

  at that dread moment as the brave bent down with his
lighted torch a bullet pierced his brain and the next sec-
ond a man mounted leading another horse bounded into


the buffalo bill storsesc



the ring of yelling demons and before a second elapsed
dave estes was free and upon his own horse

  it was buffalo bill who was by his side and as he
handed dave one revolver he used the other in the line
of red men and as both men rode swiftly away over the

lain they left dead warriors in their trail the rest like
ellow bear utterly astounded did not think of firing
until both were beyond shot

  away sped buffalo bill on the matchless powder face
while dave estes on his own favorite black hawk rode
close on his heels with his good spencer rifle once more
ready for work for it had not been taken from his saddle
and when buffalo bill crossing the river came upon the
horses fastened in the edge of the grove he saw and se-
cured the steed of dave to aid in his bold attempt to
save him	v

  let us take down the river-it is our best chance
cried dave to buffalo bill as they swept beyond rifle shot
of the black feet

  not for the world dave cried our hero any
route but that dove eye has gone that way to get cus-
ter and his men to come to our help our horses are
good-we can lead all day and pick off the nearest at
long range we will bear off to the northwest and
theyll follow us and none will take her trail

  agreed bill-agreed i thought my time had come
when that black-muzzled cuss bent down to set fire to the
timber stacked around me

  you were in close quarters and if i hadnt dropped
him so sudden and charged yelling i doubt if i could
have got you off with a whole skin we have had better
luck than i expected

  they were riding at the topmost speed of their horses
in a directly contrary direction from that taken by dove
eye and as buffalo bill looked back he saw the whole
band of black feet in pursuit

  they had a long start and though they slackened
their speed so as not to tire their horses they kept far in
advance

  before they had ridden a dozen miles they were obliged
to change their course for the quick eye of buffalo bill
detected a fresh body of mounted men whom he sup-
posed to be black feet coming to join their chief

  this alteration of course took him from the direct
line to the hills hoping then in the night time to hide his
trail and elude pursuit

  on rode the scouts their horses yet fresh and strong
and as they left mile after mile behind the more scat-
tering became the line of those who pursued

  at noon when they halted in a stream not more than
a dozen were in sight

  well take it easier dave from this on said buf-
falo bill i dont want to get too far for i am going
to save spotted tail yet we can use up these fellows at
long range and then choose our distance from the rest
till dove eye brings custer up for i know she will-she
is lightning when she rides

  all right pard we can take the few that follow now
without leaving this drink

  we could but well draw them a little farther for if
any turn back we frnight lose em

  youre right again bill-always right youve got

the coolest head and steadiest nerve of any man on the
plains

  that will do for you to say dave but come ofi-i
want to find cover

  coming to a country with here and there a clump of
rocks they looked for cover and soon found if

  behind a clump of rocks and sage brush they dis-
mounted letting their horses nibble at some bunch grass

  when they came within very long range there was but
few of the mounted warriors and these came as if their
horses were tired out

  i wish there were twenty now wlien we have such
good cover said dave as they drew nearer and nearer

  i am not greedy said buffalo bill with one of his
quiet smiles we will have more ammunition left for
the next tussle

  the warriors were now in easy range but the two
scoyts sure-of them when they chose to open fire were
in fco hurry they waited to see if any more would
heave in sight

  when the first of these was within sixty or seventy
yards and tfie hindmost not more than three hundred
buffalo bill quietly asked dave if he was ready

  yes-which one shall i take said dave

  you take the nearest and ill drop the laziest of the
lot the fellow in the raar thatll bring the rest to a
standstill and end the job

  all right-bill say the word for ive got my level

  fire as you hear the click of my gun said the scour

  the next instant both rifics sent their unerring bullets
forth and the two indians singled out went from their
horses at the same instant the ret as the brave scouts
expected halted but it was too late for their safety

  shot after shot as quick as lightning flew from the
ready rifles and the pursuit was ended

  warriors lay dead upon the ground and tired horses
turned away to rest and graze free from their cruel
riders lash

  now dave we may as well look for meat for sup-
per and then for a place to camp up toward the hills i
dont believe well be troubled much more if at all to-
day and well hide our trail when we get water

  that is so pard-and there is an antelope in reach
said dave sending a ball to the heart of the animal as
it stood for an instant on a ridge

  he rode over and in a few minutes a hind quarter all
he cared to carry was hanging to his saddle and then
dave turned with buffalo bill toward the mountains

  the scouts were determined to gain a point from
which with their field glasses they could scan the coun-
try below and watch the movements of the indians and
see when the troops were on the march for buffalo sill
felt confident that dove eye had escaped

chapter ix

cindahs mysterious communication

  it was not until her late captors were defeated and
most of them stricken down that cindah the sunflower
knew who it was that had ambuscaded and attracted
them or realized whether she was only changing from
one captor to another or was once more free

  but now she found that it was wanda herself who
the buffalo bill stories



headed this parly and who had remained there to rest
while only her best mounted warriors had gone on with
yellow bear who had met her in this valley

  wanda looked angrily at cindah and asked how it was
that she had been captured with red plume

  cindah ever fearful of the wrath of this fierce woman
answered that she had ridden a little way from the vil-
lage and was in sight of it when these sioux rode sud-
denly up and surrounded her red plume had made a
brave resistance

  where was kincatah the one-eyed asked wanda

  she rode with us but she would have a high-spirited
horse and it ran away with hcr said cindah who could
hardly restrain laughing as she remembered the way the
old hag went flying out of sight

  she was a fool if her neck is broken it will be small
loss said wanda angrily

  yellow bear came to me empty-handed as i said he
would and with an arm broken he now seeks revenge
but he will have no success but i will give him these
prisoners for the torture stake

  with a huge tree at her back she sat and gazed into
the fire while near her cindah reclined on the grass

  red plume stood with his eyes apparently fixed upon
the moon in the clear sky though at times he dropped
a furtive glance upon the face of cindah as the firejight
fell upon her

  at last wanda closed her eyes and her heavy breath-
ing told that she slept

  cindah drew from her bosom the roll of bark which
she had taken from the hollow tree and with a pleased
look she read it over

  suddenly she started and a cry nearly broke from her
lips for another roll almost like the first dropped di-
rectly in her lap

  cindah looked quickly around to see if any one had
noticed this but the only one near who appeared to be
awake was red plume and he was standing with his head
turned as if he was listening to some sound

  cindah looked eagerly all around her up into the trees
and in every direction

  she unrolled the bark and evidently written in haste
with a piece of charcoal were these words

  he who loves the sunflower is near her now she
may sleep in peace for he will watch over her safety
dreams will hover about her and give her bright visions

  near me now she murmured where can be be
and who in what shape can i see himi a spirit can-
not write afld leave these signs oh that i might see
him i

  a sigh reached her ears from whence she knew not
but she knew she heard it

  she looked up into the shadowy trees she looked on
the sleeping forms about her at red plume standing
silent and immovable as a statue it could not be he
he could not write or use the language found in her
letters

  i will try to sleep maybe the spirit of dreams
will help me she murmured and i will ask the spirit
to show him to me so i may remember him if he comes
before my waking eyes

  then she lay down on a blanket which red plume had
spread for her and soon she slept

chapter x

a paleface recognized

 before day dawned wanda the black feet queen had
 her warriors astir for the distant sound of guns had
 reached her ears and she knew that yellow bear had met

 enemies

 at the first gleam of light sufficient to show a trail she
 moved on at the head of her band bidding red plume
 attend cindah the sunflower who rode farther back in
 the line

 a special guard was placed over the sioux prisoners
 whom wanda designed as a surprise to yellow bear

 did cindah the sunflower see the blessed spirit of
 dreams last night asked red flume

 yes said the girl

 is it right that red plume should hear wliat the
 dream spirit told her

 the dream spirit came to me as a young paleface
 with dark eyes and long flowing hair as black as night
 itself he held a roll of white bark in his hand and on
 it was written i love cindah the white rose of the
 prairie 

 a paleface is cindah sure that his fvce was white
 asked red plume with a sad disappointed look

 yes he was young and his voice was low like that
 of the ringdove

 the dream spirit is a liej murmured the young
 brave in a tone too low for her to understand what he
 said

but she saw that his face looked dark and troubled and

 she said

 is not red plume the good friend fii cindah as
 well

yes but a cloud is on his spirit he too has had

 a dream

will not red plume tell his dream to cindah

 the young warrior was about to reply when there was
 a sudden commotion in the line and wanda put the
 whole column forward at its greatest speed

 the other band under yellow bear were seen scat-
 tered over the plains as if in flight and the daring queen
 thinking that the chief had been attacked by superior
 numbers hurried on to his assistance

 red plume and cindah had no further chance to
 speak

 then wanda met yellow bear whohad remained with
 a chosen band of warriors while the rest of his braves
 had dashed away in pursuit of the two scouts

 yellow bear had his two prisoners with him

 when wanda rode up and met her chief she glanced
 at spotted tail and at the captive boyd and asked

are these all the prisoners yellow bear has taken 

 all said the chief yet the belts of his warriors
 bear the scalps of many palefaces

 where is dove eye asked the queen

 she is not here dove eye and long rifle and
 another paleface are yet on the plains but my warriors
 are on their trail they will be mine before the sun goes
 down

 a smile of derision passed over her face and wanda
 was about to speak when a cry from the lips of cindah
 attracted the attention of all
	the buffalo bill stories

  who-who is this  she cried as she rode up to cap-
tain boyd and looked earnestly in his face

  a paleface doomed to the torture-stake said yellow
bear sternly

  no no he must not die he is the dream spirit
whom i saw last night she cried j

  had she seen the blabk bitter iook of hatred cast on
that young fair face by red plume cindah would have
trembled

  cindah is a child she dreams too much why is
she not at home in the village of yellow bear asked
the chief

  she and red plume were captured in sight of your
lodge by the sioux wanda rescued them and she holds
sioux captives as a present for her chief said the
queen

  at a signal from the woman the prisoners were brought
into thepresence of yellow bear

  spotted tail recognized young beaver and asked him
why he had let a woman become his captor

  because young beaver was blind and fell into a trap
said the young chief bitterly the great spirit has
willed that he should die with his chief

  the will of the great spirit shall be done and it is
not for us to weep over it said spotted tail calmly
we can teach the black feet how sioux warriors can
die

  yellow bear now ordered the column to move to a
camping-ground where he would wait for his warriors
who were out in pursuit of the fugitives seeing that
cindah looked with strange longing on the face of the
young captain whom she persisted in calling the dream
spirit he bade wanda to keep her close under her own
eye and apart from all byt red plume

  at noon the entire party was in camp on the banks of
the river	

  here yellow bear waited for his scattered warriors to
ntfly sending upr smoke after smoke to show where he
was

  spotted tail looked grimly on while these smokes
ascended for he knew they would serve as signals to
rally his warriors too

  i f dove eye had escaped she would carry the news of
his capture to those who would rescue him or perish in
the trial

chapter xi

the pursuit op dove eve-

  when dove eye rode away from buffalo bill to whom
unasked she had giveo her heart she did not dread her
per when she thoit that the scouts safety would
depend entirely oil her success in carrying help to him
and those whom he was determined to rescue-her father
an thi little brave-she nerved herself to hasten to
carry out his wishes

  while darkness shielded her keeping close under cover
of the trees lining the bank of the river she rode as
swiftly as her horse would go

  she rode thus for miles before she came to the great
bend in the stream of which buffalo bill had spoken

  it was not yet daylight when she reached this spot
and she hastened to cross before the light should enable
any one to discover her

   she crossed safely and while the rosy light of the
coming day allowed the peaks of which the scout had
spoken to stand out boldly to her sight as a guide she
also felt that her danger was just beginning

   heading directly for the distant peak the brave girl
gave her horse his -rein for she knew that every mile
gained at this point would be the most important of all

   she rode for an hour before she dared to look back
and then it was on the crest of a knoll that she glanced
over her shoulder to see if she was pursued

  one eager look and she knew that men were on her
track they were very far in the rear but she could
make out horsemen scattered along the plain

   she let her noble steed rest for a few minutes for she
knew that a long cruel race was begun

   on over a treeless plain-on the brave girl rode paus-
ing not until a small lake came in sight

   here for fully ten minutes she rested to let her horse
drink from the cool water and lave his tired limbs

   her pursuers gained while she thus halted until she
could count them easily only six were now in sight but
these seemed well mounted

   with her horse rested and refreshed she again started
forward the wisdom of her act became at once apparent

   her horse had gained renewed vigor and her pursuers
were almost out of sight

   now with all the cool thought and courage that would
have done credit to a warrior she gave her horse its will
she would reach the range of her own people or the
fort where the white soldiers lived and then if her pur-
suers still followed her trail their scalps should hang at
her belt

   once in a long while she looked back and she became
aware that her pursuers yet followed though they too
must have halted at the lake to refresh their animals

   but she still dashed forward now urging her horse to
do its best on a level stretch then letting it breathe as it
came to an ascent confident that by management she
could keep going until night with its friendly shadows
would help her elude those who so persistently followed

   at last dove eye felt that her horse was weakening
when he reached an ascent and she allowed him to
slacken his speed for rest she could feel his limbs trem-
bling even while he walked

   ajid yet her pursuers six still in number were in sight
and closer than they had been from the start

   she lashed her horse now to its last efforts far ahead
she saw trees and if she could gain the forest she might
elude those who were in chase

   her pursuers near enough to see her almost frantic
exertions now seemed as determined to prevent her suc-
cess

   their shrill yells reached her ears and though she
knew no fear of death her heart was maddened at the
thought of failure

   her noble horse seemed to feel all that she felt it
leaped madly on even though every leap seemed but a
staggering bound which would be its last

   on-only a mile more and she ould be under cover of
the wild-wood her horse though black as jet in its
native hue was now white with foaming sweat

   a few hundred yards more and the girl would reach
the forest shades
the buffalo bill stories

  while in reach of the deadly rifle shot the brave horse
made one fearful leap and fell-a ball had reached its
vitals

  yell after yell of triumph broke from the pursuers
fiendish lips

  the heroic girl was on her feet as her horse fell head-
long and with her fathers rifle in her hand she turned
to face her foes

chapter xii

the scouts separate

  when buffalo bill and dave estes reached the hills
which overlooked wind river valley leaving no trail
for some miles because they rode up in the bed of a small
stream they had a fair chance to inspect the country
below

  through a powerful field-glass buffalo bill could dis-
tinctly make out the encampment of yellow bear and
see that lie intended to remain there at least over night
for his hunters were seen killing and dressing game in
the vicinity of the camp

  i do believe the old cuss thinks his braves will find us
and take us or our scalps said dave he wouldnt
wait if it wasnt for that when he must know the sioux
will rally to rescue their chief

  he is waiting as much for dove eye as for us said
the older scout he has been smitten by her beauty
and it is hard for him to lose her i hope she has got off
safely i shall not feel easy till i know she has if she
is captured farewell to anv hope for spotted tail yel-
low bear would burn him before the sioux could strike a
blow to save huh

  how are we to find out whether she has got through
all right or not

  we will know if we see the troops coming quick
enough but i doubt whether she knows the country if
she has been chased out of the line of peaks which mark
fort thompson shell never find custer i feel very un-
easy ahoutit

  so do i said dave

  uneasy enough to go and look for her trail and to
follow it up askedbill in a careless tone but with an
earnest look in his eyes

  and leave you here alone in the hills

  im better able to take care of myself alone than she
ist said buffalo bill

  thats true as preachin but how can i find her
trail

  easy if she crossed the river at the great bend and
steered due east for browns peak as i told her to
there is a good mark to find it bv her horse i notjced
when i rescued her from yellow bear was shod before-
it had been shod behind but the shoes were off

  an indian horse shod

  the indian horse i reckon had been stolen from
some emigrant train for i saw a white mans brand on
the haunch

  that accounts for the shoes then but what will you
do if i go and try to take her trail 

  wait hereabouts and watch them down there if
they move-ill move and if i see a rocket at night or
three quick black smokes in the day ill know where you
are and answer you



  bill ive half i mind o go when mgfit sets ihr
  go-dave-go and ill feel the easier for it

  youll not run any extra risk and lose your hair
dave how often must i tell you that ive done run-
ning any risks i can help

  done running risks thats rich-when you faced a
hundred deaths to get me clear this morning

  well dave my boy i couldnt help it for i know
you would have done that for me

  yes i would bill said dave earnestly i never
could go back and face your wife if i had left your bones
on the plains

  i hope youll have no occasion to dave but come
while your horse is filling up on bunch grass we may as
well have some of that antelope over the fire youll need
all your strength to-night and to-morrow you must
get far out of sight of any of the red scouts before day
thats so if it is decided that i go

  of course it is

  dave said no more but at once went to slicing up
some antelope steaks while buffalo bill made a fire in a
little hollow out of small dry sticks which blazed up
strong and hot without emitting any smoke

  in a little while the scouts had a good hearty meal
ready and they enjoyed it

  meantime the horses luxuriated on the tender grass
which skirted the stream

  after eating the two men looked very carefully to their
arms inspected the amount of ammunition on hand and
planned signal marks which buffalo bill would leave if
the indians changed base and he had to follow them

  the moment night set in dave estes mounted his
horse and shaking buffalo bills hand warmly rode
away taking his course bv the evening star

  buffalo bill was now alone for a time he stood with
folded arms listening to the sound made by the horse of
dave estes as the latter rode down by the brook then
when that sound died away he looked down at the
twinkling lights made by the indian camp-fires

  ive a good mind to give them an almighty scare be-
tween now and davlight he muttered to himself

  then on second thought he added

  it is better not it might make yellow bear hurrv
up to get rid of spotted tail and that yourtgster bovd
powder face now left the grass and came up where
bill was standing

  how is it old nag all safe around here asked the
scout as if the horse could really understand the ques-
tion

  the animal lay down close td where he stood

  tired and sleepy and all is safe said his master
patting the faithful horse and then he unrolled the
blanket from the rear of the saddle and wrapping him-
self in it he lay down with his head upon the side of the
horse knowing that being as sensitive to sound as the
best watch-dqg the animal would start at the slightest
alarm and arouse him should his slumber be heavy

chapter xiii

the tiger op the comanches

  never more fiercely did a tigress turn at bay than did
dove eye when her faithful horse shot down shfe found
her hope of escape cut off
i	the buffalo

  

  with tie ioahecf rifle in her hand she stood a secopd
while six black foot fiends came yelling on then she
shot the foremost dead with a ball sent fairly through his
heart

  the girl had no time to reload the rifle for the other
five came charging on but the horse of the warrior whom
she had killed now lightened of his weight gained on the
others and as it neared her she caught the loose and
flying rein and in an instant more had bounded to its
back

  but the animal swerved as it approached her faithful
steed and a ball from one of the pursuing braves struck
it in the side and a second time the noble girl was un-
horsed

  clubbing the empty rifle she turned to battle to the last
without a thought of surrender and the black feet were
close upon her when out from among the forest trees
came the pealing yells of other indians and while the
black feet drew in their horses close in front of her a
cloud of arrows hurled through the air on either side
and the astonished girl saw the black feet melt down in
the agonies of death

  she knew at a glance that those were not sioux war-
riors who rode out to scalp her enemies whom they had
just slain

  the bright serapes the long bows and longer lances
told her that they were either comanches from the far
south on one of their far-extended forays or else the
savage apaches

  a score of painted yelling fiends dashed forward and
tore the scalps from the heads of the slain while as
many more surrounded her asking questions in a tongue
she could not understand

  she faced them all fearlessly for her heart was strong
to its bravest tension and when one a large and hideous
wretch laid his hand upon her shoulder she hurled him
back with an indignant action which brought cries of
applause from the rest while it so angered him that he
drew a knife from its belt and raised it to strike

  at the same instant a young warrior with a plume on
his head caught the arm of the savage and wrenching
his knife from him threw it far out on the plain

  do you speak in the tongue of the palefaces of the
north  asked the young chief

  i do she answered

  who are you and of what tribe he asked

  i am dove eye the daughter of spotted tail the
chief of the big horn sioux

  the red rose of the tribe klamat the tiger of the
comanches has heard of you

  are you klamat  she asked

   that is my name he answered drawing up his tall
form proudly

  then you are a great brave you will not make war
on a woman 

  no dove eye is very beautiful-more beautiful than
any maiden in the land of the comanches klamat will
make her his wife

  no it cannot be dove eye has given her heart to
another

  dove eye will change her mind said the comanche
calmly he will not ask her to hurry he will give her
time to think

bull stories

  dove eye has something else to think of her father
is a prisoner in the hands of the cruel black feet dove
eye escaped from them this morning-and was on her
way to get help to rescue him

  yes klamat saw the deed of dove eye and he
said now have mine eyes looked upon a woman fit to be 
the wife of a great chief 

  dove eye cares not for life if her father perishes
  where are they now 

  in the great gap of the big mountain

  klamat will go there and he will take spotted tail
out of the hands of his enemies then he will bring her
father to dove eye and he will say i have done a good
deed for you-then dove eye will be my wife

  dove eye made no answet

  klamat interpreted hef silence in his favor and he
said

  an hours ride from here in the timber we have a
camp made strong as the palefaces make theirs to that
camp dove eye will be taken klamat will take all his
warriors and find the black feet and bring spotted tail
away from them

  she could not ask for any further favor she asked
that she might ride back with him for she thought if she
could do no more she might rejoin buffalo bill

  klamat said

  no the comanches will ride fast exve eye is al-
ready tired she looks like a flower that wilts and is
ready to perish she must go to the camp of klamat

  she bowed her head and when a horse was brought
for her to ride she mounted it handing klamat the
rifle of her father she said

  if the comanche chief sees spotted tail tell him there
is his rifle dove eye killed one enemy while she car-
ried it

chapter xiv

halt who comes there

  it was a strange night there were no storm-omens
yet every little while a mass of black broken clouds
would pitch up from the west and come rolling far up
in the sky as if driven by a gale though down where
buffalo bill lay there was no wind and far down in the
valley he could see that the fires burned steady

  buffalo bill tired as he was lay a long time thinking
about dave and dove eye but at last he fell asleep

he was wakened by the uneasy action of powder face
the animal indicated that it had heard suspicious
sounds and buffalo bill felt confident that the danger
whatever it was was very near the animal did not
make the slightest motion but lay still

  then buffalo bill heard sounds-very light but dis-t
tinct it was plainly the sound of one or more persons
coming up the hill among the tangled patches of sage-
brush

  neither horse nor man moved for buffalo bill thought
that the indians were thus scouting the hills on foot to
find him

  nearer and nearer the scout heard them come

  he cocked his rifle for he believed he would have to
use it

  hark said some one in good english that was a
strange noise
the buffalo bill stories



  a stick broke said another voice low and soft-
 plainly the voice of a woman

  it cannot be dave with dove eye-surely said the
 scout mentally

  whoever it was they remained silent evidently listen-
 ing for a minute or more

  then they moved on and in another minute would be
 fairly upon him when the scout in a low stern tone
 cried out

  halt who comes there

  friend to any one not leagued with the savages

  ah is it you captain boyd  advance said buffalo
 bill in his natural voice who is with you

  an angel i believe one who lias been a saving angel
 to me for she cut the thong that bound me about two
 hours ago and led me out froni among those who meant
 to roast me alive she is white and beautiful though
 yellow bear claims her as his daughter

  i have heard of a beautiful white girl among the black
 feet known as the sunflower said buffalo bill she
 is supposed to have been stolen from the settlement when
 young and raised by them

  i am cindah the sunflower said the soft voice of
 the young girl who now approached the spot where buf-
 falo bill stood-he and powder face having both risen

  well i am glad you are out of bad hands and in such
 good company captain boyd said the scout but
 therell be a fuss down there when they know you have
 got away

  hark they know it now said cindah anxiously
 we must not stop yellow bear will hunt us as the
 gray wolf hunts the wounded deer

  fierce yells could be heard far down the valley

  when daylight comes theyll follow you easily we
 have a few hours to get a start and we must play cun-
 ning both of you walk up the brook then enter the
 stream and come down a little way in the water then
 out on the other side and down to where i am

  captain boyd and cindah obeyed without hesitation
 and when they were once more by the side of buffalo bill
 they had gone nearly a quarter o a mile in distance

  now follow me dont step out of the water after you
 enter it said the scout

  and leading powder face he started toward the plains
 going ahead of the horse and followed by boyd and
 cindah the scout went directly up the brook in the swift
 current

  whenever they paused they could hear the noise of the
 excited black feet on the search far below

  as they ascended the stream the gorge through which
 it came narrowed and the banks rose high on either side
 and it became very difficult to proceed

  at last the glimmer of coming day began to show a
 waterfall which powder face could not pass tumbled
 down from a lofty ledge

  it seems to me as if we were in a trap said captain
 boyd

  we are if our trail is discovered said bill but
 we are in a splendid place for defense we must wait
 and see how things look by daylight

  we will not have to wait long said boyd

  in a short time sufficient light came to the scout to see

 on his right a great chasm in the cliff where the water
 at some high flood had swept out huge portions of rock

  weve a good resting-place in there said buffalo
 bill a better hiding-place could not be chosen

  he at once led powder face into this great hall and
 tearing some grass from the roots in the waters edge he
 threw it down for the animal to eat

  he now had time to take a fair look at cindah the
sunflower

  girl you are beautiful he exclaimed in astonish-
 ment as his eyes wandered over her lovely face and
 form

  oh if the dream spirit will but think so she mur-
 mured looking at captain boyd

  what does she mean by the dream spirit asked
buffalo bill

  that appears to be the name she has given me said
 boyd

  you are he who came to me in my dream he to whom
i have given my heart cried cindah you are he
whom i have led - away from death that you may be
mine and the lovely creature threw her arm about the
captains neck	

  he seemed as much embarrassed as a schoolboy get-
ting hugged before all the school but she did not no-
tice it

  a pretty clear case of love at first sight murmured
 buffalo bill and as it stands rather useful since it has
 gotten its object out of rather a tight place

  if you and the sunflower will remain here quiet and
 look out for powder face he added i will go up
 above and reconnoitre

  i will leave both my needle-gun and rifle said the
 scout they will only be in my way in climbing

  i will take care of the weapons and use them if neces-
 sary said boyd

chapter xv

the comanches captive

  when dave estes left buffalo bill he kept down the
stream until he reached the plain then knowing that
this was the line the scout had told dove eye to follow
dave rode for the peak at a fair speed

  when day dawned dave had left the timber on wind
river out of sight

  he rode on but for a long time found no tracks but
 at last he found some quite fresh the horses were un-
 shod and they were in column heading to the west

  she must have met some of her tribe and returned
 he said as he examined the track carefully

  dave went on a half-mile and found a place where the
 column had halted and in a sandy spot he found other
 tracks these were of the horses going east and one
 track was plainly that of a horse shod as buffalo bill
 had fold him the horse dove eye rode was shod

  ill never leave this track till i find the girl or horse
 said dave

  nearer and nearer he came to the timber ahed the
day was well advanced when dave saw several dark ob-
jects ahead of him

  he halted took out his glass and soon made out that
 men and horses apparently dead were scattered here and
 there


the buffalo bill stories

   indians if alive wouldnt lie about loose like that
 he muttered there has been a fight

   he spurred his horse to full speed and in five minutes
 he was on the late battle-ground he recognized the slain
 and scalped indians to be black feet he saw at once
 by the peculiar arrows with which they had been killed
 that it was the work of comanches

   but when he came to the two dead horses killed by
 rifle balls and one of these the shod horse of dove eye
 he was puzzled again

   the black feet had nearly overtaken dove eye he
reasoned and she had -shot one with her fathers rifle
for bill had told him she carried it they in turn had
shot her horse and then the comanches had charged
from the woods and killed them

   he found where a large body probably fifty or sixty
 mounted warriors had ridden off to the west crossing
 the trail of dove eve and her pursuers and heading for
 wind river gap

   looking farther he found a return trail with only a
 few horses leading into the forest

   taking this he soon came to proof that dove eye was
 with this party

   he did not like to leave his horse but when he came to
 a stream he concluded he could reconnoitre best on foot
 so he led the horse to a thicket out of sight of the main
 trail and left him

   i smell smoke i he muttered there is a camp-fire
 close at hand

   the moment that he smelled the smoke dave estes 
left the trail that he followed springing lightly over a
low clump of bushes he crouched down and listened 

   soon he heard a trampling of hoofs which satisfied
 him that he was near a corral

   with form bant down he crept cautiously on he had
 not gone a hundred yards before he found feeding with-
 out any visible guard about thirty fine ponies-better
 stock than he had ever seen used by the northern indians

   while he gazed at them and thought how easily he
could stampede the herd something like the sound of an
ax came to his ears

   as the grassy spot was surrounded by dense timber
 he could not see beyond it but he concluded to creep
 around to the left without disturbing the animals and
 aee what he could discover

   it took him some time to get around for the timber
 was dense and full of underbrush

   once around he passed through the thicket until he
 became convinced by the sounds that he was close upon
 an encampment

   concealing his rifle carefully he ascended a tree

   he had only ascended about half way when he looked
 down directly into a small stockade capable of holding
 about a hundred men

   it was built vfrhite man fashion with posts set close to-
 gether in the ground and a narrow gateway through
 which but one could enter at a time a few loopholes
 commanded the trail which led to it

   some indian warriors of whom there were fifteen or
 twenty inside the stockade were building a little shelter

in the corner evidently for the use of one on whom
daves eyes rested with eager anxiety

  that one was dove eye who seated on a pile of buf-
falo robes seemed to take her position quite coolly

  she hasnt been abused-that is one comfort sai
dave as he looked at her but she mustnt stay there
to risk it

  he now looked at all the surroundings and began to
plan out future work

  he had no doubt that when it was finished she would
be isolated in the shed from the indians

  dave looked at the pickets in that comer they were
as thick as his thigh and it woult be impossible to cut
through them

  but where the soil was thrown up the young scout
could see that it was of a loose sandy nature he might
at night dig under it with his knife and hands and thus
approach her if she could only be made aware of his
presence

  he was screened among the leaves and with a thick
background so he felt quite secure there perched up in
the brandies within actual pistol-shot of the comanche
and their captive he was  near that the scent of some
buffalo meat roasting before the fire affected him most
unpleasantly for dave was hungry but to attract her
notice must be his first thought

  dave now tried the coo of the ring-dove

  dove eye started at the sound listened attentively and
then looked np into the trees the bird was her favorite

  dave watched the indians closely and he saw that
none of them looked up from their work he repeated it
and gently shook a branch which extended toward the
stockade

  dove eye saw the branch move and her eyes became at
once riveted on the tree

  now dave crept farther along until he was sure she
could see his face and form and he took the red bandana
which he had worn loose about his neck and held it up

  her form was motionless but the fixed eyes of the
girl t-pld him that he was seen was recognized

  quickly he bent his head down on the palm of hi
hand then put his hand over his eyes signifying as well
as he could that when it was time to sleep he wsiuld help
her

  she answered by bending her head forward into the
palms of her hands as if asleep

  dave nodded and then he drew back to watch and

wait

  he now looked around him at every point so as to
familiarize himself with every bit of ground over which
he must pass in approaching the stockade and in getting
awav from it if he succeeded in releasing dove eye

  the indians had now roofed over the little cabin

  the head brave examined the work and approachcd
dove eye and by signs gave her to understand that she
was to lode there thus proving to dave that she did not
understand their language

  dove eye pointed to the meat roasting by the fire and
to her mouth then reclined her head upon her hand and
closed her eyes

  she would eat her supper and then go into the lodge to
sleep	 v	

  the comanches assented and one of them cut sev-
the buffalo bill stories

eral slices of the roast meat from the piece before the
fire ai-d gave it to her

  dove eye reached out her hand for his knife to use in
cuttirig it and the brave handed it to her without hesita-
tion

  dave watched her as she ate slowly he saw that she
did not give the brave his knife again

  sharp-sharp as a new jack-knife in everything
muttered dave full of admiration

  night was not far off and dave got cautiously down
from the tree

  he could hear the indians as some went out to look
after the ponies go and return

  he crept closer to the corner where dove eye lay in
her cabin and gave out the quick sharp chirp of the
cricket

  it was answered in a moment his heart beat fast
he was now within an arms length of the indian maiden
and only the pickets kept them apart

  with excessive caution he began to dig a tunnel under
the pickets

  when he paused to listen he became satisfied that
dove eye was doing the same thing from the inside

  dave saw to his great uneasiness that a guard was
set and that several times he approached the little lodge
where dove eye lay to listen

  dove eye seemed to be fully aware of this for at such
times she snored like a low-pressure steamboat much to
the amusement of the scout though he feared her absence
would be the more quickly discovered from this

  he worked away manfully and had got a cavity under
the posts dug and he expected soon to have it large
enough when a new peril approached

chapter xvii

cindah acts as cook

  buffalo bill having left a good supply of grass before
powder face cautioned byd to remain quiet in the
hiding-place there was no need to caution cindah for
she was bound in her infatuation to remain where her
dream spirit was

  the scout hurried forward to a point from which he
could look down into the valley

  he saw as far as his eye could reach scattered parties
of indians apparently in search of their fugitives

  what seemed singular to him was that there seemed to
be a great accession in the numbers of the indians as if
all the black feet in the nation were coming to answer
the signals of yellow bear

  but suddenly this was accounted for he saw the scat-
tered parties in the east riding westward with great rapid-
ity-he saw by wreaths of smoke here and there in the
distance that they were not all black feet that were fn
sight-that the sioux most likely had come to answer
the signal smokes of spotted tail

it is dog eat dog-let them fight it out  he said

  with his glass he swept far and near hoping to recog-
nize dave estes

  feeling as if he could relish a square meal the scout
made up his mind to have it so he returned toward the
hiding-place where his horse and boyd kept company
with the sunflower

  near the edge of the cliff buffalo bill gathered a bun-
dle of dry sticks with which to make a fire

  all comfortable her  asked the scout as he entered
the cave threw down his bundle of wood and unfastened
some meat from the strap which held it to his saddle

  yes thank you have you any news from our anx-
ious friends in the valley replied boyd

  nothing that can serve us just now they seem
pretty busy there at present i will take another look
at them by and by at present i propose to have some
breakfast

  cindah knows how to cook she will prepare the
meat said the girl

  thank you my good girl said the scout kindly
if you would rather do it than not you may

  cindah took the forked sticks which the hunter had
provided and soon had the meat in position and then
while buffalo bill was relating to boyd his belief that
the sioux had come in contact with the black feet be-
low she stood and listened-

  she stood listening when the sound of a stone drop-
ping from the ledge at the mouth of the cave drew her
quick eye in that direction at the same instant hear-
ing the sound buffalo bill darted a glance where she
did

  his hand flew to his pistol belt for there stood an
armed indian warrior almost within a spears length

chapter xvibi

the escape

  when it was discovered that the prisoner the young
paleface had escaped though he had lain bound hand
and foot close to the shelter of branches made for yet-
low bear and his family there was a tremendous excite-
ment in the camp of the black feet

  the alarm was given loudly and parties of braves
were sent in every direction

  the discovery was made by the sentinel who had been
directed to patrol the camp

  yellow bear excited to frenzy by the escape of one
whom he intended to torture drove his hatchet into the
brain of the luckless sentinel without waiting to ask
how the escape occurred

  a moment later the voice of a young brave was
heard shouting

  cindah the sunflower slept near wanda the queen
she is not there now where has she gone

  it was red plume who spoke

  then he remembered that the fair girl had said the
paleface should not die-that he was the bright spirit
of her dreams and in an instant he comprehended how
the bonds of the pale face had been severed

  cindah the sunflower

  warriors shouted her name on every side but there
was no answer

  she has gone with the paleface said wanda bit-
terly

  she has turned on the hand that fed her like all
of the bad blood she has been a she-wolf to steal away
from those who raised her when they are taken let
her burn by his sidei y-


the buffalo bill stories

 yellofo bear did not speak he bowed his hfcad in
 grief

 for he loved the girl as if she were his own child he
 had ever called her so

  let not a brave rest till she is found he said but
  let not a hair of her head be harmed yellow bear has
  spoken

 yellow bear is growing old said wanda bitterly
 old and foolish he lets his heart speak before his
 head takes thought he is a child

 he stood and gazed at spotted tail who sat upon
 the ground and looked at him

 the sioux saw the young paleface go off said
 yellow bear

 spotted tail nodded assent

 did he go alone asked yellow bear

 spotted tail made no answer and the black feet
 chief again asked the question

 how or when he went said spotted tail firmly i
 have no tales to tell yellow bear must look to his
 guards and not to spotted tail

 yellow bear for an instant placed his hand on his
 hatchet and he felt like ending the days of the chief then
 and there if he did so he would not have the joy of
 seeing him tortured

 so he turned away and asked for red plume

 no one could tell where he was he had gone with
 the rest to look for cindah and the fugitive paleface

 wanda in her bitterness said

 all this has come because yellow bear was not
 content with his own squaws but must listen to dreams
 like a fool

 woman yellow bear will not let even you call
 nim a fool said the chief angrily you will eat your
 words or lose your tongue i

 may not a woman speak the truth asked the squaw

 wanda has spoken a lie the great spirit comes
 and whispers in dreams and he is not a fool who opens
 his ear to them yellow bear does not want to quarrel
 with wanda he does not wish to forget she is his
 wife

 he did or he would not be here said wanda
 bound woman-like to have the last word

 yellow bear made no reply but turned away to see in
 person to the security of young beaver and the other
 captives having found them safe he came back to his
 own campfire folded his blanket about his form and
 sat down thus he remained until day dawned when
 he sent all his braves and warriors except a guard to
 seek far and near for the fugitives

chapter xix

discovered

  dave heard the sounds of something approaching
 stealthily in the bushes he was startled brave as he
 was for at first he thought surely it was the tread of men
 walking lightly and carefully

 could it be other indians coming to surprise these
 or had he been overheard or discovered and were the
 comanches creeping up in his rear to surprise him

 he rose from the work so near completed and knife
 in hand stood on guard he heard the step coming

nearer and he knew there was more than one making
them now

  he glanced through the jackets and saw that the
comanche sentinel had heard the noise for he tea stood
in a listening attitude

  nearer and nearer and dave knew that it was made
by animals

  the smell of that meat has drawn em he mur-
mured

  a growl low and snappish told him that the large
gray wolf of the prairie was his visitor answering
growls also told him that a pack of them was at hand
he had no feaf that they would attack him unless they
were hungry

  he dared not make any noise to drive them away
for that would at once discover his presence to those in-
side the stockade neither did he dare to bend down
and continue his work

  one of the animals having come within reach of his
arm received a severe prod from his knife one so deep
that the blood gushed out in a torrent

  true to their wolf nature the other wolves instantly
sprang op the wounded animal and amid horrible
growls and snarls tore it to pieces and went to devour-
ing it	

  the noise woke every indian and as dave peered
through the chinks in the posts he saw them stand and
consult they evidently feared a stampede among their
horses and were about to come out to attack the wolves

  to rush back through the pack of wolves and get
speedily into the thickest of the brush was the work of a
few seconds only and not a second too soon for the
indians with burning firebrands in their hands rushed
out of the stockade and while some sent a shower of
arrows after the wolves others threw the firebrands at
them had dave remained near the stockade he would
have been discovered

  the wolves fled in terror from the spot and the in-
dians seeing that their ponies were not disturbed re-
turned

  when all was still dave crept back the warriors
were crouched about the fire talking in low tones one
of them went to the little lodge where dove eye lay
and lookd m

  the young girl was there and he had so covered the
signs of her work with herrobes that the watrior saw
nothing to excite his suspicions

  dave began to work for time had been lost during this
interruption

  ten minutes later he touched her hand with hia then
for the first time he ventured a whisper

  keep still while i dig lest i hurt vou with my

knife 

  she did not answer but she ceased work

  it was well she did the comanches seemed uneasy
again the head brave came and looked at her she was
wrapped up in her robes in time and he went back to his
comrades satisfied that all was right

  dave now worked like a beaver and in a little while
had a hole so large that he could raise his head inside
the lodge he was small but he knew that she was not
so largeas he

  come he whispered come
the buffalo bill stories



 he drew back to the outside of the tunnel and in a
 second after she was by his side she had the knife of
 the comanche brave in her hand

 and what pleased dave just then even more she had
 a large piece of meat in the other hand which she gave
 him

 he had fasted since the night before and was faint
 with hunger but he had no time or inclination to eat
 until at a greater distance from those comanche braves

 he whispered follow in my trail and be still as
 beath

 when they were at the edge of the little prairie dave
 halted to consult with her and to decide whether it was
 besi to stampede their horses ort to try and get away
 without noise and on his horse get such a long start
 that they might not be overtaken

 half of the night was yet before them a few whis-
 pered words and the latter plan was decided upon

so dave followed by dove eye crept out to where
he had left his own horse

 dave led him out to the trail mounted and bade dove
 eye take her seat behind him

 then he took the route for the open plains whence he
 would shape a course for the fort to which buffalo bill
 had first directed her

 when he felt free he gave him the rein and spoke out
 dove eye has had hard luck

yes said the girl did long rifle send you to
help me

he let me come it was my own heart that sent
me

 the little brave has a good heart dove eye was a
 prisoner to klamat the comanche

 what klamat the tiger was he in the stockade
 no-he left me there a prisoner while he went to
 find my father he said he would take him away from
 yellow bear and then come back to make me his wife
 but i would put this knife in my heart first i love
 long rifle-i will be his wife

 i buffalo bill or long rifle as you call him has a
 wife already

what of that he is a great hunter and can feed
more wives than i have fingers on both my hands

 we palefaces have a law and one wife is all that law
 jill let us have

 that is a fool law suppose there are a heap more
 iwomen than there are men must all but one go with-
 out a husband

 dave was puzzled but he bravely answered

 yes of course

 dove eye is not a paleface she loves long rifle
 and if he has one wife or a dozen she does not care
 dave was not good at argument no man is that is
 in love and dave was in love with dove eye

  jhey had paused to listen many times before day but
 i had heartf no sound of pursuit so far but now when day
  broke they knew of course that the absence of dove
 i eye had been discovered

 i we have every bit of twenty miles start and that is
 i a big thing said dave when dove eye suggested that
 i the comanches would follow their trail

 two on one horse will tire him out dove eye had
i better walk said the girl

  nary time if there is walking to do ill go afoot
said dave my black hawk can carry us both and
make eighty miles a day

  as they were now where a barren rocky ridge stretched
out nearly in the course which they should follow dave
decided to leave the stream

  they rode on a little way to a bit of timber and now
dave thought it safe to rest for a short time and to eat
some of the meat which dove eye had been so thought-
ful to save

  the two dismounted from the tired horse which at
once went to feeding

  the roasted buffalo meat chosen from the tenderest
part of the animal was both tender and juicy and
dave as well as dove eye speedily began to lessen the
bulk

  while they were thus engaged dave noticed that ni
horse stopped feeding and turned his head with ears
pointed towatd the route over which they had coma

  in a second the scout was on his feet the next mo-
ment he was in the saddle calling dove eye to mount
behind him for he saw not a half a mile off the lances of
a band of warriors on his trail

  save yourself little brave-the horse will not carry
both she cried

  it will carry both or none cried dave earnestly
mount with me or i dismount and fight it out here

  little brave has a good heart but he is a big fool ta
risk his life for a squaw said dove eye

  i dont think so said dave as dove eye sprang uft
behind him

  the next second he sped away over the ridge as faaft
as his horse could carry the double burden

  on rode the heroic scout looking now only for soma
good place where he could halt take cover and fight
for life  

  ahead there was a patch of trees and if he could
gain it before his pursuers came up dave thought that
he could hold them in check while dove eye could
escape

  on he sped spurring his horse as he never had spurred
him before

  but weight began to tell and while the shelter ahead
was yet a mile off at least he felt that the noble horse
was beginning to lose ground

  he did not speak but he took one of the two revolvers
from his belt and placed it irr the hand of dove eye

  if it comes to the worst he said in a low tone die
with that in your hand and dont have a load left while
there is a comanche before you im good for a dozen
if they dont hit me too hard

  dove eye took the weapon and looked back the
comanches were strung along for half a mile in a line
and only seven or eight were very near

  one was within almost a spears length and he had an
arrow drawn up in his bow

chapter xx

natolah the woman with a tongue

  dove eye knew that life for one or both depended on
her quick as thought she raised the pistol and fired
directly at the face of the comanche and he apparently
	the buffalo

at the same instant drew his arrow to the head and let
it go

  the bullet must have been a second the quickest in its
fatal mission for the arrow flew just above the head of
the scout while the ball from dove eyes pistol pierced
the brain of the comanche and he fell forward on his
horse but with a strange tenacity still clung to his horse
with his leg and arms

  the animal sprang forward with terror as he felt the
death pressure and in an instant was alongside of black
hawk and dave raised his pistol to dispatch the closing
enemy as he thought him to be

  the comanche is dead said dove eye

  as she did so dave caught the rein of the other horse
as it flew loose near his hand jerked the animal in close
to his and pushed the indian from his seat

  this took scarce a second and with a bound he sat
astride the other horse calling to dove eye to take his
saddle on the black hawk

  he turned while he was speaking clearing his spencer
rifle from its sling and without checking the horse he
sent the next comanche in the line to the happy hunt-
ing grounds

  good for the little brave  cried dove eye we
cap fight them all

  but not what are ahead of us cried dave gloomily
and he called to her to hold up the woods ahead are
full of reds he added were cut off and our time
has cone

  dove eye looked in the direction in which he pointed
and she saw fully a hundred painted warriors within a
hundred yards mounted and ready to charge

  one glance and dove eye cried

  they are my people they are sioux 	 

  and waving a scarf which she tore from her waist
she shoujted out a shrill cry which in an instant changed
the hostile attitude of the indians and as they rode forth
with weapons lowered she pointed to the comanches
who had halted

  instantly a band of sioux warriors darted away after
the comanches who now turned to fly and while they
dashed on dove eye bidding the little brave ride close
to her and fear not rode on to meet the others

  among them sat an elderly indian woman on a fine
horse with handsome trappings

  my mother said dove eye and she rode up to the
woman taking her hand

  who is this paleface and whence coftie youl asked
the wife of spotted tail for such she was

  he is the little brave i was a prsoner in the hands
of the comanches he got me away you may thank
him that i am here replied dove eye

  where is spotted tail

bill stories

                                                

  in the hands of the black feet i was on my wa
to the great fort of the palefaces td get soldiers to hel
long rifle to take him away long rifle has stayed tc
watch him and save him

  are there not enough sioux to fight the black fee
and to save their chief asked the wife of spotted tail
must we ask the palefaces to help us signals wen
seen two suns ago in the west and i sent all the warrior
who were in from the hunt to answer them then 
went to find more and they are here

  long rifle knows better than we do and he bade mi
go to the fort of tljfe palefaces the black feet an
many and they fight strong said dove eye le
my mother go on with the braves if she will-dove eyi
will do as she promised long rifle she would-she wil
go for the paleface soldiers

  where is long rifle

  he is watching to save spotted tail my father hi
sent the little brave to save and help me

  the wife of spotted tail called two of the sub-chief
to her side and held a consultation

  ah look there cried dve estes who had been in
tently watching to see the sioux and the comanche
meet in battle those who followed us have beer
joined by more and now with your own people they ridi
this way what does it mean

  i do not know it is strange said dove eye
then as a warrior rode ahead of the rest coming
rapidly on she cried

  it is my father-he is free but where is long
rifle	

chapter xxi

captain boyd makes a friend of red plume

  when buffalo bill saw the dark face of the warrior ir
the mouth of the cave he believed him to be only the
leader of a band for he had no thought one would dan
to face two armed men and he raised his pistol to enc
his career

  but with the speed of thought cindah caught hij
arm

  do not fire she cried it is red plume my frienc
and brother

  let him shoot red plume does not want to liv
any longer said the young indian coming forward anc
throwing bow and spear on the ground he has fou
lowed cindah the sunflower to see her with the peoplt
she has chosen as her friends-the people of her own
color-to ask her if she is here of her own free choice 

  cindah is here because she wanted to come she
could not see the brave dream spirit die at the torture-
post to which yellow bear had sworn to bind him
the buffalo bill stories



cindah pointed to boyd as she spoke 

feed plume looked also at the young paleface and
imturning to cindah aaked in a low earnest tone
fhas the sunflower given her heart to this paleface
loin she calls the dream spirit
fyes i love him said cindah
rtlien it is time for red plume to die said the young
irrior and he drew hie knife from its scabbard
fthe red plume loves the sunflower and must lose
r he too learned to make speaking papers for the
lite captive told him how

the red plume has made the talking papers tell his
ie for cindah for it was not her dream spirit she
es not love the red plume and he will die

he raised his knife with the evident intention to plunge
in his breast

boyd caught his arm and snatched away the weapon
the mind of red plufne will be easy when he sleeps

	last sleep said the indian sullenly

but boyd drew him aside and whispered some words
the ear of the indian which seemed to have a strange
ect upon him 

he drew back looked earnestly in the face of the
ring captain then he took both of the captains hands
his and said

paleface brother we will be good friends red
lunie will no longer grieve because the sunflower loves
u

buffalo bill and cindah were astonished at this sud-
 change and the scout rather doubted its honesty
ut it was better than he expected

will red plume now say if he came alone or are
lcre others of his tribe on our tpail asked buffalo
ill

red plume came alone no eye but his found the
ail of ciiidah and the palefaces he would let none
ee where he went when he found it for he lay down
nd crawled like a snake now red plume will stay
fith cindah and her friends and help them he does
ot want to go back to yellow bear the great chief
i mad and he will kill red plume if he sees him

is spotted tail yet safe asked buffalo bill

he will be watched till the death song is sung

it must not be sung for him said the scout i
lave promised to save him and i must

what is the indians life to you asked boyd

as a pledged safeguard of my word everything i
lad an object when i made him a promise and extracted
ine from him spotted tail promised peace for his peo-
ile with ours and i promised to see him back in safety

o	his people

khcrw can we get away-let alone helping him  asked
loyd

  i dont know yet but all will come right  ive been
in some hard scrapes before but i got through all safe in
the end said buffalo bill quietly when night comes
on i shall make a scout down toward the camp i may
see some way to get the old chief out of the clutches of
his enemy

  red plume will go and help you said the indian

  what and leave the sunflower here with the pale-
face asked buffalo bill rather surprised at this volun-
teer service

  yes red plume knows that the sunflower is safe
he is no longer a fool he will not be jealous of the
dream spirit his white brother

  buffalo bill smiled for he knew that boyd had cun-
ningly played upon the indians superstition telling him
a secret that he was cindahs dream spirit this
would make the indian youth at once give up the girl to
one the great spirit had sent

  then cindah said

  red plume is wise he shall be my good brother as
hejias always been

  we may as well think of something more necessary
than dreams said buffalo bill the elk steaks ax
rather overdone now and i am hungry

chapter xxii

the little scouts blow

  when yellow bear had sent away nearly all his war-
riors in search of the fugitives and wanda had sunk
sulkily down to rest on the couch of robes from which
she had risen the old chief called a medicine man to
dress his broken arm

  the medicine man was not skillful and the wounded
chief groaned spotted tail heard his captor groan and
sawth color leave the cheek of yellow bear it seemed
to give him delight

  ugh he said yellow bear groans

  dog yellow bear groans because the time goes so
slow he wants to get all his people together so that
they may see what a coward squaw yellow bear has
found that they may hear spotted tail cry out when
die red fire licks up his blood

  the black feet have not been born who will hear
spotted tail complain he is now in more pain than
yellow bear yet he does not whine like a sick child as
yellow bear does

  wait-wait we will see said yellow bear who
did not wince again

  this done he was about to return to his temporary
lodge when he saw a band of mounted warriors come
sweeping over the plains in the direction of his camp
he saw at a glance that they were strange warriors and


the buffal o bill stories

he sprang upon tiis own war steed which stood saddled
close at hand and dashed away

 the next minute this band headed by a fine-looking
 young warrior drew rein where spotted tail and his
 fellow prisoners were seated

 where is spotted tail the father of dove eye the
 red rose of the prairies - asked the leader of these
 strangers

 i am spotted tail said the sioux chief gloomily

 the stranger spoke to his followers and one led up a
 horse and the strange chief said

 klamat the tiger of the comanches told dove eye
 i would set her father free

 dismounting he cut the thongs which bound the chief
 while two warriors lifted spotted tail upon the led
 horse

 away  cried the comanche

 and before the astonished chief could ask a question
 or even set young beaver free the comanches swept off

 spotted tail saw s they sped on what seemed to be
 bands of his own people engaged in battle with scattered
 squads of black feet but to his repeated questions the
 comanche was deaf

 he would only say

 klamat has said to dove eye she shall see her father
 he will keep his word

 spotted tail knew not whether to rejoice at this free-
 dom or not the sioux and the comanches had not
 heen friends for many years though their hunting
 grounds were so far apart that they seldom met if
 klamat held him as a prisoner he might live longer
 than he would have lived in the hands of yellow bear
 but would he be permitted to go back to his tribe j

 the party came suddenly in sight of a single coman-
 che

 this warrior when he met klamat spoke to lim in his
 own tongue which spotted tail did not understand

the eyed of klamat seemed to blaze with fury when
he heard hat this warrior said he paused by a mo-
ment thenthe course of the party was changed and they
rode forward more swiftly than ever

 his speed ins looks and actions told spotted tail that
 he was after some enemy who was in that direction

 he looked ferocious like the tiger that indian fame
 proclaimed that he was

 thus hours passed and spotted tail wondered at the
 endurance of the southern horses which still carried
 them on

 ahead they saw another band carrying lances like
 themselves

 they had just come to a halt for beyond them still
 was timber and in it there appeared to be many mounted
 indians

 klamat did not check his speed-lie did not halt ta
 when he saw a large band of indians coming a a char
 he turned to spotted tail and said

 these are braves of your tribe charging down 
 warriors of mine i have saved the life of spotted tai
 let there be peace between our tribes

 it shall be peace cried spotted tail

 he rode forward to check the charging braves

 who heads the sioux to-day asked spotted tail a
 the sub-chief who led the chargc as he lowered his spea
 while klamat and his warriors with spearheads reverse
 joined the chief of the sioux

 natolah the wife of spotted tail the mother of dovi
 eye replied the sub-chief

 where i dove eye eagerly asked klamat

 answer him where is dove eye my child sail
 spotted tail

 with her mother she has just come in with a pale
 face brave replied the sub-chief

 let us ride on i would look upon dove eye sail
 the comanche yesterday she was my prisoner i
 told her i would take her father from the hands of hi
 enemy and then i would make her my wife

 spotted tail made no answer but he rode on side b
 side with klamat each followed by his own warrior
 until they were in the edge of the timber wheri natola
 waited for her chief and husband

 where is dove eye was the first question as h
 approached his wife

 here said the girl who had drawn back out of ol
 servation for she could not understand why tli
 comanches were coming in this friendly guise

 she stepped forward and laid her hands upon th
 mane hi the horse which her father rode

 who is the paleface that is with dove eye con
 tinued the chief

 the little brave the friend of long rifle wh
 saved me from yellow bear who waited to watch ove
 you till i could call up the paleface braves to help yo
 drive the black feet from your hunting grounds

 the little brave is welcome in the tribe of spotte
 tail he is a great warrior said spotted tail

 who killed the comanches that followed dove eye 
 now asked klamat who had just been spoken to by on
 of his braves

 i killed two and the little brave killed two sai
 dove eye proudly

 klamat seemed for an instant to struggle with angei
 conqibring it he said as admifation of her courag
 shone in his eye

 dove eye is fit to be the wife of a great warrioi
 klamat now at peace with her people--klamat ask
 spotted tail to give him dove eye for a wife
the buffalo bill stories



 llwhat has dove eye to say asked the sioux chief
 inking anxiously on his child

i let him take a wife from among his own people
lid the girl

klamats eyes flashed as he said

i	does dove eye love the paleface dog who stole her
lom his fort 

the comanchc had no time to listen to the answer of
pve eye if she had one to make for dave estes quick
anger and quiek to act struck him a stunning blow
ir in the face and as he fell stunned to the earth cried
it

no red cuss shall call me a dog and not feel my bite
the comanches started in a body with leveled spears
avenge the insult to their chief while spotted tail
outed

no brave shall raise a hand or it is war between
e tribes

spotted tail is right the tribes have nothing to do
ith this quarrcd aid klamat himself rising from the
ound but he added tumng fiercely on the young
out there is war between us one of us must die 
im agreed on that and the one who dies will not be
e said the scout coolly

let spotted tail say how we shall fight said the
manche

you would fight as warriors fight and before all the
aves asked spotted tail

yes and before dove eye said klamat eagerly
lot two horses be brought said spotted tail then
t klamat the tiger and the little brave lay away 
capons but one-the knife which each one wears in his
it let them ride apart the distance an arrow can
 and then come together as they will spotted tail
is spoken

klamat whose stem face told his anger bade one of
s warriors to see to his horse and then he turned to
ait the time set by spotted tail for the duel

chapter xxiii

general custer

a body of cavalry rode in column over the beautiful
idulating lands which spread about the headwaters of
le big horn river

the main body-a full regiment-rode in a column of
irs with a small advance and rear guard and a flank-

	body of men not in uniform but evidently composed
what class pi daring frontiersmen who rejoice to serve
nth the army as scouts

llvith this advance accompanied by a couple of staff
peers rode a man with long fair hair whose shoulder-

straps star-bearing proclaimed hi rank to be that of a
general

  it is time california joe was back said the general
to a scout near him he said when we made our noon
halt that he would ride ahead look for an old camping-
ground that he knew and rejoin s by the middle of the
afternoon

  california joe genrally keeps his word genral cus-
ter said a scout but here comes california joe sir
on a lope

  yes he rides fast instead of waiting for us said 
the general

  he has seen reds ill bet high on that said cjheof
the officers

  column forward trot cried general custer anti i
he at once went forward at a more rtpid gait

  he soon met california joe a middle-aged scout
almost too well known in the army to need a description

  joe was mounted on a genuine mustang about as red
as his own -whiskers and as rough as his own hair j
and the broad rnru of his old slouch hat blew back from
over his honest face

  what is your hurry joe asked general custer as
he reined in his horse

  genraj said he were goin to have jest the nicest
chance to wipe out a double-handful of red varmints that
ever you did see oh its beautiful  i had a good peep
at all in camp and they never sot eyes on me 

  indians how many and where asked the general
impatiently

  sioux-about a hundred braves mounted and ready
for the war-path-in that timber over there to the nor-
west

  mounted you say then they are gone before now
  no sir not mounted but with stock to mount

  you are sure they didnt see you

  i am or some of em would have been after me like
wolves after a lame buffalo

  then ride forward with little buckshot and see
what they are doing while i follow with the column
yes genral captain will you jest let me feel the
weight of your flask one minute before i go

  joe felt the weight of the flask it was lighter when
he handed it back

  general custer now gave orders to his staff to pass
word back for action and allowed the column to close up
in compact order	

  when near the piece of timber which joe had pointed
out the general halted the command let the men dismount
to breathe their horses and waited for the report of the
scouts

  he had not long to wait california joe came riding
back even faster than he went


the buffalo bill stories

  little buckshot stated that there were nearer two hun-
dred than one hundred indians that there were co-
manches as well as sioux and that there were women
among them

  california joe told the same story and both scouts
joined in the belief that it was a war party though it
seemed singular that they should unite when the sioux
and comanches had been long known to be on bad terms

  theyre all huddled on the farther edge of that narrow
strip of timber said california joe theyve got some
kind of a talk going on we can take a bit of a circuit
to the right and throw ourselves directly in their front

  that is precisely the plan i shall adopt cried the
young general

  the orders were given and the scouts all with him as
his own body guard the gallant leader rode on

  after a gallop of a mile general custer drew rein for

	strange sight met his eye

chapter xxiv

a duel on horseback

  the preparations for the duel between klamat the
comanche tiger and dave estes were commenced it
was the sight of this duel at its commencement which
made general custer draw rein and halt his column on
the march

  the sun was a little over an hour high when spotted
tail told the two intended combatants to get ready

   take care of these gal and-if i should go under in this
fight keep them for my sake

  that was what dave said as he took off his fringed
hunting shirt his bullet pouch and powder horn and his
belt with its pistols and knife scabbard he gave her
his rifle also to hold and if he fell to keep the knife
which he was about to use-a long straight-bladed hunt-
ing-knife-required no scabbard now but with careful
forethought the little scout took a slender thong of buck-
skin and attached it to the buckhorn handle of the knife
fastening the same to his wrist

  naked to his waist the knotted muscles of his white
arms showing a tremendous strength for one so slight
his broad shoulders and full chest free from all incum-
brance with his buckskin trousers tight about his slender
waist and loose about his strong lower limbs the young
hero was ready to do battle with his brawny and gigan-
tic antagonist

  the moment he had taken off his arms and hunting-
shirt dave gave a shrill cry which brought his trained
horse black hawk up to him on a trot

  old boy weve got some lively work before us said
dave patting his horse on the hcck i may as well
lighten you all i can

  he then took off the saddle and the blanket with it
he took the girth which had bound the saddle to its j
and replaced it loosely on the horse he took ott
bridle entirely for his horse like powder face kneii
the pressure of its riders leg when and where that a
wished to turn and by his voice when to go or stop a
is the paleface ready said klamat sneeringlyi
he sat in savage pride on his horse which was sad
and bridled as usual

turning to dove eye dave took her hand and s
gal if i dont get another chance to say it-goo

i	love you and im goln to fight like lightnin to get
snake out of your way

  fight and kill him said dove eye ii he kills
 kill kim

thats the grit said dave as he sprang on his ho
the sioux chief pointed to two spears with red f
on them set in the ground about two hundred y
in front of the spot where all the indians had conj
gated and nearly the same distance apart

  the little brave will take the one nearest to the j
the comanche chief the other when spotted tail w
this lance begin the fight

  i am ready but klamat is not said dave
wears upon his breast a shield mine is bare

  it is the sign of my rank said the comanche a
laid his hand upon a shield bearing an emblem of
sun

  bare your breast coward as i have done crie
little scout

  witft a look of gloomy hatred te comanche lifted
symbol from his breast

  now he cried as he waved his long glittering lc
dave bounded to the back of his horse and rode to
spear which was set farthest east

  he had just reached it when he saw to his surp
mounted troops close at hand but he had not a momj
time to inspect them the sioux chief who did nol
the troops gave the signal

  with a yell the comanche dashed forward on a d
line for dave while the latter with his horse at an
gallop rode on to meet the charge of-the other

  as dave rode erect and easy it seemed as if th
manche prone on his horse with one hand clutching
mane the other stretched forward with the knife poil
would have a great advantage

  but when the horses were almost breast to breasts
black steed of the scout touched in the flank by hil
ers heel bounded fully a yard to one aide and d
clinging with one hand to the girth on his back real
far over and citt a deep groove in the back of thj
manche who supposed himself out of readii
the buffalo bill stories



wildly yelling the indian drew rein and turned his
irc in swift pursuit of dave

but quicker than thought the black horse impelled by
touch wheeled reared full before the flying steed of
de conmanche which fell back on its haunches and
fcth horses sat with their fore-feet in the air furiously
king and biting each other while the knives of the
jicrs played like vivid lightning in alternate thrust and

krhis lasted scarce a minute yet to all who gazed it
jemed much longer then all at once a knife was seen

i	fly high up in the air and fall yards away from the
mbatants

fcove eye trembled now for the first time one of the
mbatants was disarmed if it was the little bravehis
m was sealed

dave was seen to touch his horse which wheeled away
om the front of the other then take a short circle wav-
g his own kinfe high over his head

bending as he rode he picked up the knife which he
id struck from the hand of the comanche checked his
rse in its impetuous flight before klamat who bleed-
g from several wounds as did his opponent bleed also
ood with folded arms beside the horse which he had
 more use for waiting for the death-blow

dave looked at him as he stood there yet fearless and
ough he was at his mercy he could not slay him
ossing his knife toward the mortified chief he cried
take better care of your tools tiger of the coman-
ics mount and try your luck again

klamat is not a dog to accept life from a paleface
outed the maddened chief for he heard the derisive
ugh of dove eye he has made his life a shame and
 will throw it away

he snatched the knife from the ground as he said this
id drove it to the heart of his trembling horse

the animal with a quiver fell to the ground and then

ii	as quickly the haughty chief buried the keen reek-
g weapon in his own breast

he fell upon his horse and the duel was over

spotted tail and dove eye rushed forward to greet
e little brave and then the sioux chief saw the cav-
rv formed on the plains as he thought ready to charge
ho the paleface warriors from the big forts are
on us he cried

and he would have turned to either lead his band in
ittle or fly if there was a chance but the little scout
ied out

they are my friends and there shall be no fight i
ill ride to meet their chief

the little brave is right there shall be pee be-
mse i promised long rifle it should be so said
potted tail

 but he must go to the palefaces quickly or they will
 come to us

 i will ride at once and as i am but do not let one of
 your people move lest the soldiers think they mean to
 fight and charge upon them cried dave

 and while spotted tail held up his hand to warn the
 comanches to keep back for they were about to ride for-
 ward to take up the body of their chief dave darted away
 to meet those whom he at once recognized-general
 custer and his officers

chapter xxv

the comanches threat

 who are you and what does the scene mean whicti
 we have just witnessed cried the general as dav
 halted in front of him and saluted

 you used to call me little dave the scout general
 said estes im not in parlor rig just now ive beea
 busy a-butcherin

 dave estes the scout cried the general whftti
 terrible fight you have had we saw it all

 the bulliest fight and the bulliest little cuss that evw
 drew a knife shouted california joe

 general will you please raise a white flag to keep
 them indians right where they are till i can make a full
 report cried dave seeing how uneasy spotted tail sat
 on his horse watching what was going on theyll not
 stir till i tell em to after the flag is seen buffalo bill
 promised peace

 ill shw the flag said the general that can do no
 harm while i hear who they are and what buffalo bill
 has promised

 instantly a white handkerchief raised on a drawn
 sabre told the indians that the paleface warriors desired
 peace

 now dave tell me what indians those are

 first a band of comanches that were under a chief
 known as klamant the tiger

 i have heard of him-a blood-thirsty savage

 he is done for now it was with him i had the little
 difference which you have been looking at

 a pretty heavy difference i should say but go on
 the rest are sioux under command of spotted tail
 mrs spotted tail and miss spotted tail an angel in
 buckskin are in the party	

 spotted tail-the deadliest enemy of the whites-
 worse than red cloud ever was exclaimed general
 custer

 buffalo bill has worked the old cuss over general
 he has promised peace and yoican bet your shoulder-
 straps hell keep his word

if he does it will be better than a dozen campaigns


the buffalo bill stories

   if you will permit me to ride back now general ill
 tell the indians to go into camp on one side of the brook
 while you can take the other and you can see spotted
 ail and his chiefs and bind em down with a strong
 talk

   all right my brave man but it seems you fought a
 regular dud a knifejbattle with that bloodthirsty
 comanche klamat what was that about 

   general i almost hate to tell you but i suppose i
 i must he was in love with dove eye the daughter of
 spotted tail and so was i he called me a paleface
 dog and i knocked him down then we fought it out

  and i got the best of it

   ay-that i saw and how he wiped out his defeat

   dave now went back to spotted tail who received him
 with more respect than ever

   you are no longer a little brave he said you
 are a great brave and i adopt you for my son and i
 name you e-to-nee-the tiger killer

   do you hear that dove eye cried dave delighted
 the old man says im his son

   dove eye is glad that the little brave has conquered
 his enemy here are his weapons said the girl with-
 out the least slww of feeling as she handed dave his
 hunting-shirt rifle and belts and the shield of the dead
 comanche chief

   the scout now conyeyed the orders of the general to
 spotted tail and the indians of his tribe at once went
 into camp but the comanches took up the body of
 klamat and wrapping it in his robes held themselves
 aloof in gloomy council

   when dave was arranging with spotted tail for a
 talk to take place that night between him and the gen-
 eral the oldest brave of the comanches approached the
 spot where the scout stood

   paleface said he the comanches will go back to
 their own land to bury their chief in the ground where
 his fathers have been laid but the spirit of the great
 tiger of die comanches will never rest while you walk
 the earth we go now because our chief shook hands
 with spotted tail and we will not break his peace but
 we shall come wherever you go and we shall take your
 scalp

   the comanche turned away before dave could reply
 and a minute afterward the whole band rode away in the
 darkness

chapter xxvi

the dyinc chief and the portraits

   buffalo bill could not rest after lie had satisfied the
 hunger for he wanted to see what was going on in the
 camp of the black feet telling red plume to remain
 with sunflower and the captain while he went to scout

 he left the cave and again clambered up the precipice d
 proceeded to his lookout

  when he got to the point the scout adjusted hi gw
and commenced his observations

   the sioux are on the warpath was his first cxclanj
tion but they are fighting the black feet in squa
there does not seem to be a general battle ah one
the black feet is leaving in a hurry a courier to ra
the rest of the tribe ill spoil his game if he comes j
side of a half-mile range

  this last remark was made when buffalo bill saw
single indian mounted on a powerful horse dash aw
from the camp and ride a course to bring him almost
rifle shot

   at once he left his position and ran to a point whi
would bring him within shot of the indian

  he did not get another sight of him until he li
reached an abrupt point of rocks where a pass throu
the mountain left a way easy to traverse

  hell come through here said the scout

   an instant later the indian came in sight

  buffalo bill drew back behind a cedar tree and 
once in hrs life took a rest he generally scorned to
this always firing off-hand as quick as thought wh
he raised a rifle or pistol but he was all of a tren
from his run and he knew all depended upon his fi
shot

  so he covered his man as he came nearly head 
and fired

  he was almost sure he missed for the indian lie
swerved in his seat and the horse bounded steadily f-
ward so he took another sight over his rifle and fii
again

   just as his finger touched the trigger the horse rai-
to leap over a fallen tree and the bullet picrced his he
instead of the breast of the indian

  the horse fell and the indian went with him

   seeing that the latter did not rise the scout with
weapon cocked approached the spot and found that
first ball had done its mission-had pierced the breast
the red man

  but what astonished buffalo bill most was that
indian was yellow bear yet alive but dying

  the chief recognized him and gasped his nami
long rifle

   yes said the scout yellow bears trail is end
i did not know it was him when i fired but j macfl
promise to spotted tail once and i have kept it

   the dying chief did not seem to notice what the set
was saying but with a spasmodic effort he tugged a
thong which was about his neck until he pulled a bu-
skin bag from under his hunting-shirt

  take and keep this is for cindah the sunflow
i 

p ph the chief when she goes to the happy hunt-
grounds she will know her father and mother if
she keeps this

the chief raised the bag in his hand looked fixedly
on the scout for a moment and then his head fell back
he was dead

buffalo bill looked at him with pity then he said

 im sorry i gave my word to spotted tail to take his
scalp but i did and i must keep it i dont like to lift
hair-it is out of my line-but i mut do it to keep my
pledge but this bag-ill see what is in it

the scout opened the bag and fouud in it two morocco
ases containing two painted miniatures done in ivory
facing each other one was the portrait of a woman
with golden hair blue eyes and lovely in the extreme
the other was that of a man young and handsome but
with a darker face and hair under the picture of the
woman written on the ivory was the name adele
benoist

under the picture of the man was written edouart
benoist

the astonished scout gazed for a moment on these
pictures and then opened the other case

i-t contained the picture of an infant with a wealth of
golden curls framing in the loveliest face that buffalo
bill ever saw he looked at it an instant and muttered

ive seen a face like that somewhere

under the picture was written cecile benoist

then a thought struck him

it is cindah herself-it is cindah the sunflower as
she was and these are the pictures of her parents i will
take them to her jftiey may lead her to a happy restora-
tion yet

the scout placed the bag in his hunting-pouch and
iben with a sigh of regret at the act he took the scalp
from the head of yellow bear

i must keep my promise he said as he looked at the
plaited scalp lock trimmed with ochre-tinted strings
spotted tail if he ever sees this scalp will know it
i must go back to the cave and tell cindah what i have
frund

the scout now put the scalp out of sight and then
komed back over his trail with much slower steps than
hose taken when he camie

he paused to look down on the plains and he saw
that the indians appeared to be concentrated and that
the fighting had ceased

the sioux came out ahead he muttered as he
passed on 



chapter xxvii

dove eye recognizes her friend

  encamped with good grazing ground for their horses
plenty of wood and water at hatd and game abundant all
around the cavalry under general custer were having
what little buckshot termed a bully time while the
indians under spotted tail pleased with sundry pres-
ents were glad to be at peace with warriors who were so
much better armed and mounted than they

  spotted tail his wife and daughter were the recipi-
ents of marked attention from the officers of the com-
mand especially the latter

  the girl seemed to pay no heed to these flattering at-
tentions bright buttons and shoulder-straps were not
attractive in her eyes and that is more than can be said
of the paleface sisterhood as a general thing

  dave estes though honored by the general and his offi-
cers and an object of envious admiration among all the
sioux warriors as well as the adopted son of her father
made no apparent advance in the favor of dove eye

  he had tried to give her presents she had refused
them-kindly but firmly the acceptance of a present
means more with a girl of the red race of america than
it does with the white ones

he had asked her what he could do to please her

go and find long rifle for me was her answer

  dave did ask permission of general custer to go and
hunt up his mate but the general did not wish to spare
him until a treaty had been concluded with spotted tail
and the other chiefs and as smokes had been sent up
to call them together he told him no expedition could
leave for the present

  the warriors of the sioux nation began to come in in
answer to the smoke signals and general custer had de-
cided that on the third day from the time he encamped
he would hold a council or a big talk as spotted tail
denominated it

  it was now the second day of the encampment and it
was well advanced

  general custer said to his officers

buffalo bill must be found for this grand council

 let dove eye go said the young daughter of
spotted tail she will find long rifle if he lives or
revenge him if he is dead

  i wish she loved me as she loves buffalo bill mur-
mured dave the gal is just crazy after him i told
her he was married but that didnt make a bit of differ-
ence with her she said he was a great hunter and could
feed a dozen wives

  general custer laughed but the girl looked as grave
as ever

it was near sunset and the soldiers were all gathering

the buffalo bill stories
	the buffalo

together in anticipation of roll-call when a large band of
indians were reported coming in from the west

  the command was put under arms as usual until the
character of the visitors was ascertained

  suddenly with a cry of joy dove eye bounded upon
the horse of the general which stood saddled close by
and calling out one name dashed off to meet th ad-
vancing column

  the name was-long rifle

chapter xxviii

a little surprise

  well-thats cool said general custer laughing as
the young squaw dashed away on his horse

  she sees buffalo bill coming general said dave
estes the gal has gone clean crazy after him

  let not e-to-nee grieve said spotted tail he
shall have the handsomest women in my tribe for his
wives

  thank you boss-but id rather have one and that
one my choice

  the attention of all was on the approaching party

  in front of the indians was buffalo bill on powder
face while by his right side rode a white girl so
strangely beautiful in the picturesque dress of an indian
maiden that the general and his officers spoke their
wonder aloud

  on his left dove eye rode proudly managing the
spirited horse of the general while behind him came a
black foot indian-without war paint-it was red
plume-and a white man captain boyd

  behind with their lances full of scalps and uttering
yells which victorious warriors only can give came
young bear and a large party of sioux

  buffalo bill rather abashed with a girl on each side
of him of such different types halted when near the
spot where general custer and his staff stood and
saluted

  i am glad to see you my brave friend said the
general you see that your peace treaty with spotted
tail has not only been kept but ratified we will make
it a formal treaty to-morrow so as to send a report to
washington

  i thank you general for your welcome i hardly
expected this pleasure an hour ago but i have-some-
thing here for spotted tail i made him a promise when
i asked him to keep peace with the white men i told
him i would rescue dove eye and give him the scalp
of her captor there it is

  buffalo bill handed a scalp to the sioux chief

bill stories

  the moment the latter looked at it he pronounced t
name of yellow bear	

  yes it is his scalp said the scout my promisi
have been kept now keep yours-never let your tril
raise knife or hatchet to the palefaces while you live
spotted tail has given you his word and he will kee
it said the chief firmly then taking the hand o
dove eye who had returned the horse of the general t
his orderly he led her toward the scout and said

  she loves you take dove eye and treat her wellj
buffalo bill blushed scarlet then he stammered out
not for me i thank you ive got the sweetest bes
and prettiest littl wife that ever blessed a home i wan
no other dove eye-there is dave estes as brave i
chap as ever raised a rifle he loves you take hin
and he will make you happy

  dove eye looked at the scout for an instant withouj
speaking

  tears gathered in her dark mournful eyes then shfl
drew her robe up over her face and turned away toward
her fathers lodge

  and now said general custer will you be so kind
as to tell us who this beautiful white girl in indian co
tume is

  i am afraid she cannot tell herself general and i air
sure i cannot she has been reared from infancy b
yellow bear the black foot chief he called her his
daughter but when he was dying he gave me a bag with
the miniature of a baby a man and a woman by whai
he said i am sure that they are the pictures of herself as
an infant and of her father and mother she has them
and will show them to you

  the girl reached out the bag and general custer tool-
the picture and read the names aloud

  the general turning to cindah said

  you shall have a tent for your own occupation unti
we can reach a point where inquiries can be made tha
may restore you to relatives

  i will not stay anywhere unless the dream spirit i
with me said cindah in a determined tone and sin
pointed to boyd

  whos the gentleman asked the general as he non
took notice of the young man

  you should know me if your memory is good gen
efal said the captain in a soft and pleasant tone

  it seems to me as if i had seen you before said gen
eral custer striving to think when and where

  do you remember making a capture after genera
stuart was killed asked the captain with a peculiai
smile

  great heavens yes you were a rebel officer
exactly general i came -west to make rrty fortunt
after the war and i have folind a gold mine that wil
an out rich and better still one i hope to claim as my
ride some day

yes cried cindah i love the dream spirit and
e will be my husband

chapter xxix

the comanches revenge

nearly two months passed away the sioux having
ledged themselves to peace were allowed to roam un-
isturbed over their extensive hunting grounds

buffalo bill and his pard dave were once more lo-
itcd in their pleasant quarters at fort mcpherson near
le junction of the north and south piatt

dave estes his almost inseparable friend was the
ompanion of every hunt and ride and few men enjoyed
fe better-at least in that desolate region

in quarters assigned to her by those in power was
lindah the sunflower who had taken to reading and
tudying though she dreamed a great deal yet

cindah believing her name to be cecile benoist had
ssumed it and dressed like- other girls she was very
eautiful though all said she seemed more so in her
id costume

visited in a friendly way by the officers who all treated
with profound respect she was apparently happy
braxton boyd her lover had gone east to interest
ich investors in his mine and then he could ask cecile
knoist to become his wife

ie has some friends coming from north platte to din-
lerl said dave estes to buffalo bill very early on a
fight sunnv morning after they had got settled in quar- 
trs will you go along

i cant dave said buffalo bill not this morning
imean you know the boys outside the fort have elected
ne justice of the peace and now two of em have got up
l gjiit i reckon just to see what i know but no matter
that it is for-it is to come off at ten oclock this mom-
ig and i cant leave

i	ah right ill knock over a couple while im about
k and bring one home for you 

lall right dave but look out for your hair mate
fcmember what those comanches threatened you



  there isnt a comanche within three hundred miles
of here

  two hours later an orderly from the fort came rush-
ing in booted and spurred his sabre jingling snouuug
to buffalo bill

  youre wanted sir-quick too at headquarters in-
dians are in sight of the fort and have just shot down a
man the troops are mounting i

  poor dave groaned the scout as intuitively his
heart and head told him who had fallen the coman-
ches have killed and scalped him i would wager life
upon it

  in a minute he was armed and mounting he rode
powder face at full speed to the fort

  in less than five minutes the troops were out but
mounted on the best-of horses the indians went like the
wind over the plains and pursuit was vain

  they found the body of dave estes literally riddled
with comanche arrows and with his scalp torn from his
head

  the body was brought in by buffalo bill and it was
given burial in the burying-ground attached to the fort
where now the visitor can see that the heroic young lover
of dove eye has not been forgotten by those who knew
him well and loved him too

  

  fortune not only favored the young man braxton
boyd who had gone to the mining country to find gold
and had found it for he got backers in the east to aid
him and riches came rushing in but cecile benoist also
had luck as general custer discovered for her the parents
she could not recall

  hfr father had been an army officer and on a gold trail
with others all had been murdered by ellow bear and
his braves the chief adopting the child as his own

  going to dwell with her kindred cecile was sent to
boarding-school for a year and then became the wife of
braxton boyd and the two now live in a handsome house
in colorado

  dove eye returned with her father to their people but
the young girl refused all offers of marriage and a year
or two later died true to her love for the great scout
buffalo bill whese deeds continued to make his name
famous throughout the world and which will continue to
live in history and romance for long ages to come
