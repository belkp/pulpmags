you cun be careless ulxjut eventhing else in the
world but your breath-and get away with it but
halitosis bad breath is simply unpardonable
everyone is likely to have it at one time or
another since its primary cause is the fermenta-
tion of tiny food particles in the mouth the
insidious thin aliout halitosis is that you your
self never know when it is present and even your

best friends wont tell you

the quick pleasant way to treat your breath so
that it wont offend others is to rinse the mouth
with listerine immediately the oral cavity feels
clean and fresh the breath becomes pleasant
and agreeable

 use listerine every morning and niglit and
between times before meeting others listerine
deodorizes hours longer than ordinary mouth

light wave lengths and light years

by t oconor sloane phd

man living on this little sphere
of our solar system thinks that
it is of enough importance to
be the basis for describing the whole
universe the earth as our readers
know has its axis located by its rota-
tions the ends of which axis define or
locate the north and south poles if a
plane is assumed to pass at right angles
to the axis and through its center and
consequently through the center of the
earth it will cut our sphere into two
equal proportions and will give us a
circle called the terrestrial equator
where the plane on its emergence is
assumed to cut the surface of the
sphere this is all very simple now
suppose the plane to be extended and
to have an area large enough for all the
stars in the heavens to be projected upon
it map fashion we would have what

called the celestial equator which is pic-
tured in our minds as intersecting a great
celestial sphere just as it intersected
the earth the notion of a celestial
equator assumes or leads to the con-
ception of a celestial sphere or globe
large enough to contain all the heavenly
bodies this sphere is o inconceiv-
able magnitude and it is based upon or
founded upon our altogether insignificant
little earth

  what the size of the celestial sphere
is we do not know it means the volume
of space containing all material things
when we think of a star duster in the
celestial sphere which duster is four-
teen billion times more distant than the
sun we can picture the inconccivable
size of the celestial sphere

  edgar allan poe said that a man
could not conceive the distance of one
light wavelengths and light years



mile stone from the next one if you
occupied your spare time counting it
would require about three months to
count a million the sun is over ninety
millions of miles distant so you might
work for  months or  years to
count the miles in this comparatively
short even minute celestial distance
less than one hundred million miles but
think of counting a star clusters dis-
tance

  with all our efforts to get into the
stratosphere only a few miles away-
with our descents into the oceans depths
a few fathoms only-all such achieve-
ments are ludicrously small and trifling
we almost lose respect for our little
pigmy of a solar system and for what
we can do in it

  now the planets of our system and
we do not know how many there arc
if we include the asteroids and all of
which move around the sun each in its
own ellipse which is called its orbit by
these orbits define planes all nearly par-
allel to one another the appropriately
named mercury shows the greatest di-
vergence and venus who is next in ir-
regularity has about one half of mer-
curys departure from parallelism with
the orbits of the rest of the planets and
now we come to a trouble in our work

  the earth is slightly irregular in
shape it has mountains and oceans and
owing to these and to the equatorial di-
ameter being larger than the polar
diameter and the charging occan tides
its polar axis keeps shifting around
virtually describing closed curves one at
each end of the polar axis so that the
celestial equator is in perpetual change
but to a very small amount it takes
 years for the poles of the earth
to go all the way through the  de-
grees of their closed curve

  this is the famous precession not
procession of the equinoxes the
equinoxes meaning equal nights are the

two periods in each year when the day
and night are of equal length their
precession as their change in occurrence
is termed is about fifty seconds of arc
per annum approximately equal to the
seconds in a circle divided by the 
years if we measured one year by the
constantly shifting equinoxes we would
have sooner or later our july in mid-
winter this of course is a sort of par-
adox-we really disregard the preces-
sion of the equinoxes in our ordinary
life but let it take care of itself and
use our -day year and -day leap
year as the regulations of our months
and like most other things this is not
quite accurate

  so we have to use a basis formulated
definitely on our own little earth a
planet less than one hundredth the di-
ameter of the sun and less than one
millionth of its volume if we could
pour a succession of earths into one
great body it might be supposed to take
months to attain the volume of the sun
in approximate figures if an earth
were added every second it would re-
quire over ten days to build up a mass
equal in volume to the sun

  we have now to picture to ourselves
the great sphere holding all the stars of
the heavens so we imagine the plane of
the celestial equator passing through the
center of the earth at right angles to
its axis this gives us the imaginary
circle girdling our planet the earths
equator passing through brazil and
equador on our hemisphere the latter
country deriving its name from it as
far as the earth is concerned its equator
is fixed but owing to the precession
of the equinoxes the celestial equator has
a slight shifting which the terrestrial
equator also has if referred to the celes-
tial sphere if we left the celestial sphere
out of the reckoning we might forget the
precession of the equinoxes if the
reader has followed all this he will see


amazing stories

that the celestial equator lies in the im-
aginary plane at right angles to the
earths diameter and has the center of
our globe for its own center the center
of the earth is the center of the universe
but our equator is in perpetual change
and the celestial equator also as we have
seen the saving clause is that the mo-
tion is very slow and the starting point
of the motion is reached eventually so
that it is a closed curve that is followed
and it takes nearly  years to com-
plete the precession and start a new one
the period is called the platonic year

  it is perfectly fair to say that celes-
tial distances are but little realized
they are beyond human conception our
earth is nearly  miles from the
sun every high school pupil can come
out with that bit of information but
celestial distances are so great that ex-
cept for our little solar system miles
do not figure to attempt to use miles
would be like measuring the width of
our continent in thousandths of an inch

  the light-second is familiar to most
of us in its meaning even if we do not
carry its mileage in our minds it is
equal to the distance light travels in one
second the distance from the earth to
the sun in light seconds is found by
dividing about ninety-two million miles
by  giving nearly five hundred
light seconds

  this distance is trivial think of a
light year  miles for each sec-
ond of that period try the multiplica-
tion and you will obtain if you make no
mistake nearly six trillion miles-six
millions of millions of miles but
nothing outside of the solar system is as
near as that a star on the very
threshold of the heavens the nearest
star is about  times as far from us
as that it is  light-years distant
how long would it take to count those
miles

  the simplest and most obvious method

of measuring the distance from the ob-
server of an inaccessible object is by
triangulation a base line whose length
has to be accurately known is measured
off and from its ends the angles with the
base of the lines pointing at the ob-
ject are measured from these data
a simple calculation tells how far off
the object is suppose now that this
method is to be applied to find how many
miles distant a star is the diameter of
the earth is far too small so the diam-
eter of its orbit is used two observa-
tions of the star are taken six months
apart this gives a base line of over
 millions of miles yet the stars are
so remote that there are only a few to
which this method can be applied

  a very curious ratio gives the relative
distances of the planets venus mars
and mercury compared with those of the
nearest stars the stars in question five
in number are each about one million
times more distant from us than the
planets venus mars and mercury re-
spectively are distant from the earth
at their nearest approaches thus the
nearest star in the heavens is proximo
centauri  light years or  trillion
miles distant almost one million times
more distant than venus if we could
reach it by wireless it would take
over four and a quarter years for our
message to get to it similar coinci-
dences apply to a few other stars re-
ferred to mercury and mars respectively
the same factor one million applying to
them the distance of a star from the
earth was first measured in the year
 nearly a century ago

  as the slight irregularities of the
earths shape change the relation of the
equinoxes to the constellations in the
celestial vault they have another very
practical effect which is alluded to in
the story by jules verne which begins
in this month as a unit of measure-
ment the french decided to use a frac-
light wavelengths and light years



tion of the circumference of the earth
so they set to work to determine the
length of the line which would encom-
pass the earth from pole to pole then
having as they believed effected this
measurement and correcting it for
equatorial bulge and polar depressions
a fraction of its length was taken as
the unit of length the meter or metre
is the name of this unit in english and
it was defined as one forty millionth
part of the circumfercnce of the earth
through the poles

  it was here that an error came in
the measurement of a part of the meri-
dian which latter is the polar circum-
ference of the earth is affected by many
irregularities and the work of the as-
tronomers and their staff in executing
the measurement was not absolutely ac-
curate so the meter which is now a
legal measurement and which is invari-
able is really the distance between two
marks on a standard platinum alloy bar
at the temperature of melting ice the
bar is kept in paris with the most minute
details of care for its preservation to
keep it intact and unchanging

  the effort to obtain a natural standard
of length failed as subsequent measure-
ments of the meridian have given other
results it being assumed that the more
recent measurements are ever more and
more accurate

  it is quite interesting to read ac-
counts of the methods employed in the
work a base had to be directly meas-
ured by rods with due regard for and
with corrections for temperature then
from this and other base lines a simple
in theory triangulation gave a part of

the meridian the base line being off to
one side but in the practical measur-
ing of lengths and in getting angular
relations refinements innumerable had to
be employed

  the attempt o obtain a truly scientific
meter based on a natural dimension
failed at first but the measurement of
the length of light waves has given the
meter in paris a definite relation to a
natural linear quantity the length of
the paris meter is known with great
accuracy as referred to the wave length
of a specified light

  in the early days of the last century
the wave theory or undulatory theory of
light was decidedly inchoate huygens
had done some work on it and thomas
young developed the theory to quite a
high degree but the length of a light
wave of specific position on the spec-
trum was yet to be determined the
spectroscope has enabled any such wave
to be specified and the wave correspond-
ing to the red line in the spectrum of the
metal cadmium was selected

  the centimeter is a little less than
four tenths of an inch in length
 the wave-length of the red
line in the spectrum of the metal cad-
mium was determined it is  one
hundred millionths of a centimeter the
angstrom unit and this minute
length-unit is really the basis of all
measurements even of the most dis-
tant bodies in the heavens it is the
unit of length which specifies the length
of the platinum-iridium alloy meter pre-
served with rigorous care in paris com-
pare the length of this light wave to
the length of the light year

the manuscript

l kasr is one of those
ancient spots on the face of
the earth that strives to ac-
climate itself with each fleet-
ing generation its narrow
and cobbled streets have been polished
through the ages by the countless bare
feet of the natives who have long since
returned to the dust of their creation
only its slumbering eye can flash forth
what it has seen incoherent and in-
distinguishable yet to one who can
understand it it speaks with astonishing
and clarifying thought

  to sir john mansfield the eminent
archaeologist and egyptologist el kasr
was one place that held him spellbound
one effort of falling and rising civiliza-
tion which spoke itself plainly to him
it was in his blood those centuries-old
dwellings of masonry which squatted
against a slithering desert to protect the
pliable and susceptive body of man from
the oppressive heat of the overhead sun
it was an answer to the constant quests
of his mind this arid sand of egypt

  years he had spent upon it in it try-
ing from the pieces he detached from its
bosom to set together those drifts of
understanding into one orderly unit of
human knowledge and throughout the
successive years his heart had not stifled
one bit the thrill of discovery rather
as the days rolled by the more acute be-
came his sense of desire he knew
egypt knew what potent powers it con-
tained in its breast knew what tre-
mendous part it had played in the shap-
ing up of the ensuing generations

  yet el kasr was to him something
indefinably clear when his feet clicked
against the hot and -dusty stones when
his lungs breathed deeply of the after-
noon atmosphere it was almost as
though he were transported back through
the ages on some mental invisible breath
sun-baked was the land but the very
essence of material crumbling manifested
the lurking mysteries and the mys-
teries of this land-that -feature quick-
ened his blood 

the dirty figure of a dried and
twisted man lounged on the comer
of a shabby thoroughfare this late after-
noon his glistening dotty eyes glued on
the lost city



the torch fell upon the inscribed walls and he soon forgot everything about
him his scientific sense prevailed and he stood there for the better part
of an hour studying those writings


amazing stories

mansfields aimless ambling his hand
was beneath his tunic a torn greasy gar-
ment which accentuated his native dis-
reputableness somehow the scientist
couldnt keep his eye of him there
was something faintly familiar about the
fellow but he couldnt place him prob-
ably he had seen him in el kasr before
mansfield was well known here

  the tall englishman strolled slowly
down to the intersection long seasons
in the land had made him practically im-
mune to the constant crush of the african
sun his healthy and tanned body had
long overcome the discomforts of the
brow-beating solar rays the native on
the corner left his lounging position and
made for him

  this spot in el kasr was noted for its
ill-omened and gristly evil characters
but sir john had gone through it many
times yet there was something about
the advancing man that made him hesi-
tate and he clutched the stout stick in
his hand more tightly the manner in
which the shabby fellow concealed his
hand under the cloth of his tunic was
mysteriously ominous

  sir john whirled upon him half-rais-
ing his cane what the devil do you
mean by sneaking up on me like that

  the other shrunk his bony discolored
hand rising before him

peace he whimpered dropping
a still farther away i attempt no
harm rather i come with good fortune
for you his right hand still remained
under his tattered tunic

  what good fortune could you bring
mansfield snapped at him in wonderment
eyeing the slinking fellow from head to
foot

  please sir john dont you remem-
ber me  im horda

  the englishman stared at him some-
where he had seen this man that he was

positive but his name brought to him
no connecting identification

  dont you know me sir john i was
with you in the libyan desert excava-
tions five years ago

  then it flashed through him he w
horda el abrim the man who had been
in charge of the motley group of men
who had assisted him at that time
mansfield softened somewhat as he took
in the others sad condition what a
metamorphosis in the man he recalled
horda as being a stalwart lean fellow

and this- probably he mused it

was because he had found no other em-
ployment since then work was scarce
in this land for one of hordas type

  so its you horda he laughed
youve changed well why are you
stealing up to me like that dont you
know it is rather unhealthy

  the dirty man opened his mouth in a
grin his yellow and rotten teeth protrud-
ing like fangs he drew up closer and
snatched out his hand his fingers held
something bulky

  well

  horda looked around cautiously ex-
tended his hand look at this sir john
i know you will be interested in it
saved it for you maybe you can give
me something for it

  the sun of the dying afternoon glanced
off the enlarged bones of his twisted
hand gnarled and caked they were

  what is it he demanded taking the
bundle

  the native shook his head some-
thing old something you might give a
few pounds for

 it was wrapped and secured with
heavy twine into an inordinate mass of
stiff paper he couldnt make it out

  horda wheedled come to the shop
on the corner there is another one of
those there you can take it apart and
look at it and then maybe youll
give-
the lost city



  sir john mansfield pattered after him
holding ready his heavy stick no tell-
ing how this might turn out he told him-
self it might be a trap of some sort
these desperately needy characters down
here might do anything to secure a few
pounds

  at the corner they turned down be-
side a squatty one-story building and
horda nodded at it prodding him for-
ward mansfield followed down a littered
flight of stone steps picking himself in
and out of the strewn reeking debris
horda pushed aside a filthy covering
which served as a door and bade the
scientist enter

  mansfield glided in the interior was
a maze of shadows no window to the
entire place and were it not for the
flickering lamp upon the table in the cor-
ner it would have been a worthy hole for
ambush he crouched against the wall
sweeping the place with a quick pene-
trative scrutiny

  in one corner leaned a three-legged
table which had once consisted of four
extremities its top was shoved into a
crevice in the wall to keep it on an even
keel the floor was without adornment
of any kind save for more debris the
walls were bare of everything but ghostly
shadows upon the table however was
heaped a pile of odds and ends of every
description

what surprised the englishman
was the nondescript figure of a
white man slouched in a small ram-
shaddy chair near the table his face
was covered with a straggly frizzy
beard and in his hand as though just
taking it away from his lips reposed a
bottle

  he blew a volume of odious breath
from him perhaps bent upon craftily
neutralizing the stench already contained
in the chamber and grinned

  welcome sir john mansfield

  his throat emitted a hollow laugh

  the scientist grasped his stick and
raised it there was something strange
about all this and the last thing he in-
tended to do was to let himself be hood-
winked and caught unaware

  but the white man only sank deeper
into the seat and dropped his head back
for another swig at the bottle it came
away from his mouth to the accompani-
ment of deep contented sighs his hairy
arm served as an efficient wiper bloated
leering eyes fixed on mansfield

  need not worry sir john need not
worry i no danger here he coughed
suddenly and it grew in intensity rising
deep from within his breast until his in-
flated countenance was obscured by a
purplish tinge no-no danger

  mansfield regarded him closely it
was easy to see that the fellow was on
his last resources that cough pre-
dicted a final stage of lung deterioration
and from the manner in which he swung
the bottle again and again to his lips it
seemed to be a powerful deadening in-
fluence probably some renegade this
chap it wasnt the first one the english-
man had seen succumb to the merciless
sun of the continent it got them in the
end the windowless room was evidence
of his fanatic desire for sunless days and
nights

  the fellow wheezed horda heard
you were in town said he was going to
look you up he-we got something
here we know is in your line had it for
a long time want to get rid of it now
got to get some money cant get
whiskey n rum for nothing you know
he burst into a cackle

  mansfield went closer what is this
thing you have his eyes didnt leave
either man

  the man of the bottle started to rise
but halted he turned to the table be-
side him and extracted from the dis-
orderly stuff another bundle of paper


amazing stories

wrapped with cord it was similar to
the one the scientist held

  heres the mate to the batch you got
now sir john caught it as it was flung
to him curiosity aroused stepped into
the feeble glare of the lamp and bent
down loosening the twine he glared at
the first sheet

sir john mansfield knew the
thrill of discovery his vast experi-
ence had thrown many thrills his way
there was the time for instance when
he had been the first man to enter the
twenty century old tomb of a pharaoh of
which little or nothing had ever been
gleaned and he had found the sarco-
phagus chamber just as though its con-
tents had been put there yesterday
prowling maudlin vandals had not come
upon this the hieratic scripts were
present in all their invaluable glory
that indeed had been a thrill

  but as mansfields eyes scanned the
paper before him under the pale illumi-
nation an odd shiver crept down his
spine he couldnt diagnose the peculiar
feeling long association with papyrus
of the ancicnt egyptians had sensitized
his fingers there was something about
tliis odd grain which seemed to leap
through his nerve centers electrically

  this faded papyrus which he hold now
was old-old old the knowledge
kept ringing through his brain like a
clanging spirit his hot eyes were in-
tent upon the small characters inscribed
thereon the treacherous light gave him
no assistance and he heaped an epithet
upon it hastily he tore the cord from
the other bundle his pulse quickening
both were of the same material

  interesting-no broke in the scat-
tered voice of the white man

  mansfield shuffled the sheets they
were all hard and stiff with the weight
of ages in many places the paper had
cracked and fallen away time also had

wrecked its toll and had faded large por-
tions of the picture-writing but the
englishman gnashed his teeth at the
atrocious light the fluttering shadows
ridiculed every attempt to decipher any-
thing 

  he straightened up abruptly assemb-
ling again the manuscript carefully en-
twining the pages with the cord

  might be worth a couple of pounds
maybe the fellow sleazed greedily
or maybe ten-twenty-fifty

  mansfield glared at horda and the
decrepit man in the chair where did
you get this he questioned slowly

  anythings fair in this mans coun-
try the white man spat mirthlessly
dead mans graves carry things-things
which people like to have

  you mean it was taken from some

tomb-

  a man has to live sir john horda
interrupted what is the difference

  mansfield considered the situation care-
fully he didnt know as yet what mat-
ter of importance the manuscript con-
tained if any but if an inherent feeling
meant anything if ever his heart had
dictated an intuition this script was
something out of the ordinary still he
was a scientist to the core he must
know from whence this came already
he gathered that these men had somehow
plundered a tomb there was a severe
penalty for breaking into the sand-sealed
burial grounds of centuries existence
it was his duty as an egyptologist re-
spected by the egyptian government to
abide by its law and enforce it

out the two men wouldnt talk he
u threatened them cajoled them and
once even stalked to the door with the
bundles under his arm to go to the
proper authorities but the white fellow
angrily drew forth a pistol and pointed
it at him mansfield perceived what
highly strung impulses he was dealing
the lost city



with the white man was crazed for the
need of liquor hed get it through any
means

  the bloated face loomed hideously in
the shadowy gloom the weapon was
distorted until it appeared as large as a
small cannon he croaked you know
its valuable i need money fair ex-
change come across

  how much mansfields mouth said
grimly

  the tone of the other changed only
just enough to keep some life in a body
im not a criminal

  the englishman smiled wryly shoving
the manuscript into the sack pocket of
his coat he removed his wallet he
could do nothing else but acquiesce
carefully he detached two ten pound
notes

  here horda dole it out bit by bit
so you dont drown the rascal the
natives eyes glistened at the sight of the
money mansfield made for the door
swinging his stick vigorously at the
threshold he paused

   in all probability this will find its way
into the governments hands when it
does you scoundrels beware it will
hound you to death

  he brushed aside the grimy curtain
which bore evidence of being the door
and departed outside his feet carried
him at a running pace to his lodgings

chapter ii

the revelation

in his room he tossed aside the cane
yanked down the blinds and turned
on full the lights his pulse
throbbed as he drew forth the manu-
script and tenderly placed it upon the
table for a moment he was almost
afraid to look at the sheets lest his en-
thusiasm be rudely jolted why did he
feel this way about this unknown writ-

ing what made him believe that it
might be something of value  was it his
instinctive touch-the touch of one who
had delved in such matters for years
did this give him inalienable right to
rely upon his feelings

  he secured a magnifying glass and
dropped upon the chair he took the
first sheet spread it smooth and leaned
over it for a good five minutes he
studied the hieroglyphs then his brow
furrowed into a frown there was some-
thing strange here was it a jest of
some sort directed toward him was a
hoax being attempted 

  his eyes dropped upon the paper once
more in an intense scrutiny of the in-
scriptions presently he took another
sheet of the papyrus his eyes grew
wide great heavens his blood slowed
down such a thing was almost un-
believable 

  sir john mansfield was one of the
greatest of living egyptologists head of
the archaeology department at oxford
an authority unexcelled on the written
word and lives of peoples long gone-
specifically of those who had dwelled and
pulsated through the land of egypt cen-
turies before any debate or argument
on hieroglyphic hieratic or demotic
writing which could not be fully and
justifiably answered was tendered to him
it was a passion with him and the world
of science knew and respected his
knowledge

  every scientist is suffused by an under-
current of hope that at some time he will
pierce the gloom and bring out a dis-
covery which will obscure all others
but a true undeviating scientist faced
with that discovery will pit it against
every conceivable test for any possible
weakness

  and that is what mansfield did he
couldnt admit to himself that this manu-
script was deceiving no he subjected
it relentlessly to every examination his


amazing stories

scientific knowledge knew to bring out
the possible fraudulent character the
paper itself underwent a microscopic
scanning through the hours of the
night he labored tirelessly anxiously

  dawn was creeping around the borders
of the window blinds when he arrived at
the foregone conclusion that no living
hand could have constructed the manu-
script before him no-and no hand
within the past thousand years the
script was genuine solemnly the evidence
of intrinsic truth

  eeside him lay the littered sheets of his
own handwriting scribbled as he had de-
ciphered the manuscript through the
process he had worked slowly and pains-
takingly the full interpretation was not
yet evident owing to the many sheets
which were faded and not legible but
now he gathered together the notes and
pieced them into an understandable whole

  suddenly with the realization before
him his body grew cold 

the document was written about
- b c the period cor-
responding with the reign of cheops one
of the mighty pharaohs of egypt but
the thing that made sir john mansfields
blood turn to ice was the indisputable fact
that the manuscript before him had not
been written by a scribe of that period
not by some educated person but by the
majestic figure the superciliously royal
fingers of cheops himself

  the knowledge in itself was enough to
make him fall back in his chair and stare
stupidly at the wall it was unbelievable
but it was authentic  his eye saw that

  within a half hour he had read and
re-read everything he had written and
then his mind seemed to swell with the
importance of the discovery it was
stupendous rapt eyes perused the in-
formation gleaned condensed it read
thus

  i cheops ruler of the mightiest land
put this down on record only i know
the contents and existence of it but i
must get it down so that posterity should
it succeed in locating my tomb will
understand it will be put near my
sarcophagus in a hermetically sealed
container

  it was during a summer night that
there was ushered into my presence a
white man of great handsomeness who
desired private talk with me i took him
into the inner room behind the throne
and he revealed an astonishing tale he
claimed that he was from the city of
atlantis

  now i know as do myscientists that
atlantis is but a myth i therefore be-
came indignant at being secluded with a
man insane and was on the verge of
calling for my executioner but he rose
to his feet a jjowerfully imposing figure
he wanted only to be proven i took
one guard with me and followed him
being led to the outskirts of the city out
upon the desert there i envisioned a
gash in the earth and standing nearby
was another man tall and well-built

  the hole was an entrance of some
sort and shortly we descended and it took
us to a vast domain underneath it was

with abated breath that- a great

portion of the script hereafter was
faded

  the friendship between the rulers of
atlantis and myself continued not one
soul above knew of the existence of the
lost race the guard who followed me
i had executed for conspiracy

  in order to conceal the entrance i
ordered the construction of a massive
edifice and image which would stand over
the descent it was a giant statue of a
reposing body of an animal with a human
head in it i embodied silence-one
who knew everything and said nothing
so that it would not bring attention i
caused to be made all over my dominion
the lost city



other massivities of solid rock many in
pyramidical shapes

   there is only one entrance all others
are false to get in one must get under
the square slab directly under the face
and mouth a stout flat knife must be
driven in between the third and fourth
slabs until you feel a vibration then
you must hasten with speed to the right
paw and insert the knife under the slab
at the farthest end the huge mass of
rock will slide gently back displaying the
entrance for a few moments

   from there the signs will lead you on
the only route to the city of atlantis-

it was some time before he finally
digested the information thus di-
vulged for years he had been one of
the most indefatigable of workers trying
to secure some archaeological clues con-
cerning the supposed atlantis legend
had it that a highly civilized race once
dwelt on a vast extension of land sup-
posedly off africa where now the atlan-
tic ocean rolls majestically on it was
thought that some cataclysmic disturb-
ance of the earth at that point had sub-
merged the land of atlantis beneath the
waters of the great ocean some scien-
tists had asserted the belief that atlantis
had been a body of land existing between
africa and south america without in-
terruption and that upon its being sub-
merged it had left a portion of its
civilization upon the american continent
evidence of the belief was cited in the
aztecs the incas

  be that as it may however mansfield
had never secured anything of positive
nature upon which to build a theory
but this seemed to be something very
different atlantis underneath the sahara
desert how could that be it sounded
preposterous yet the very handwriting
of cheops himself had asserted the point
clearly after having existed for almost
five thousand years this manuscript mel-

lowed with age would be indeed farcical
if it were anything but the truth sir
john mansfield shook his head abstract-
edly his heart whispering that it couldnt
be a travesty on a scientific hope

  and then there was the mystery of
the mammoth sphinx which had never
been solved this fine piece of ancient
art and man power had long been a source
of wonder to humanity there had never
been any reason found which could ex-
plain the great thing of rock and
masonry upon the wastes of the desert
no explanation for the pyramid erections
and such an answer as propounded in
this ancient egyptian script appeared
plausible now

  but mansfield wasnt one to jump at
conclusions and let enthusiasm run
amuck he rose from his chair and
paced die room nervously going over
every link seeking flaws at intervals
he would turn abruptly and stare at the
table laden with the papyrus and notes
to make sure that it was not a dream
with every passing moment his blood
seeped through the shackles of restraint

  the picture of the great sphinx rose
up before him clearly and he studied it
mentally time and again he had gone
around it and once he had even been
up and over it but now aware of its
potency and meaning he sought to bring
together all threads of information con-
cerning it which he knew

the squatting figure of gizeh was
carved out of solid rock excepting
the paws which were constructed of
masonry and was  feet long its head
being  feet in length the ever-shift-
ing sands of the desert had constantly
sought to cower this mute creature and
it had been a watchful job on the part of
the egyptians to keep the image from
being obscured its face though had
been mutilated vandalously by the super-


amazing stories

stitious arabs who used it as a target
for their rifles

  why hadnt the entrance been dis-
covered before he wondered he re-
called the time when an american expedi-
tion had commented on a rumbling
sound no explanation had been forth-
coming for that unknown noise and as
sir john mansfield thought of the manu-
script of cheops he realized that in some
manner one of the men must have hit
the right spot under the face what
brink of discovery he had stood upon
and had walked away

  with shaking hands he bound the
manuscript in oilskin then dropped on
the bed for a short sleep when he arose
he was wide awake and he gathered to-
gether his belongings the fever of ex-
ploration was once more rising within
him he felt that anything else he would
do would only rasp on his nerves

chapter iii

the great sphinx

in cairo he stopped at a hotel where
he was well known and to the man-
ager he entrusted the safe-keeping
of the oilskin-wrapped manuscript to be
kept until it was called for but nothing
did he make known of the value of its
contents

  it was a clear and star-bejeweled
night when mansfield moved around the
great sphinx his every movement
threw shadows over the sandy blanket
that gleamed dully and stretched away
from the rock image into the abysmal
void of night he was garbed in khaki
breeches and shirt a revolver and a belt
of cartridges were at his waist-for what
reason he had taken these he couldnt tell
but he felt safer with them upon his
person several electric torches were
stilffed into his pockets with an unlit one
in his hand

  the movement in the slithering sand
was precarious and he had to walk
around cautiously at one of the mas-
sive paws he paused clutching the
weather-beaten masonry to steady him-
self keen eyes inspected the distance
to the main body from the outstretched
pair of reposing legs before he let him-
self into the rift

  the shaft of his now-lit torch swept
the darkness of the shaded rocky breast
and he proceeded slowly toward the up-
flung mass of stone from his belt he
drew forth one of two long steely knives
directly under the stern and set visage of
the immobile animal he threw the light
around

  the instructions of the manuscript
were clear he was to get under the
face between the third and fourth
slabs of rock he must wedge the knife
until some response was got the torch
illumined the slabs and defined every
crack in them clearly but he was un-
decided where to begin time had
forced itself too manifestly upon them
there were cracks and cracks some of
them extending from side to side wide
and deep which had been formed long
after the huge animal of stone had been
put into impassive inanimate existence

  he scrutinized the massive slabs with
a sharp eye until he felt that he could
discern the original separations of the
rock they too seemed to have wilted
and widened with age reaching a de-
cision he inserted the knife into one of
the cracks used it as a probe to discover
its possible depth and waited but noth-
ing happened

  for a long while he repeated the pro-
cess at each split of the rock running the
blade back and forth often the end of
the knife could not begin to probe the
cavity which extended to an unfeelable
depth and the repeated failures irked
him but he couldnt let that indomitable
urge within him succumb he kept at it
the lost city



    the writing of cheops was imprinted
  lucidly upon his brain right under the
  face it said and right under the face
  he tried again and again between the
  third and fourth slabs crevice after
  crevice felt the blade of his knife it was
  tedious and with no result

    his reoccupation suddenly snapped
  from its lethargy as he felt the blade in
  his hand fall into a well-defined groove
  the thin steel clicked into something
  something seemed to whisper to him that
  he had found the objective with nerves
  that couldnt be held from prickling into
  irresistible exaltation he turned away for
  a moment no use getting unduly en-
  thusiastic over this he reasoned he
   must work slowly carefully examine
  everything properly

    again and with utmost attention he
  slipped the instrument deep sure
  enough the point of the blade fell into
  the groove again then with a stifled
  breath he started to slide the knife along
  the crack

    for about a foot it went smoothly his
  eyes fixed upon the moving handle then
  with the same abruptness it came to an
  obstruction with a stop his face fell
  surely this wasnt one of those false
  leads back and again he moved the
  blade with the same results

     finally with baffled rage at hitting the
  end of the groove as often as he had he
  slammed the blade violently against it
  it was all so misleading and then it
  happened

    as the knife struck the hidden barrier
  with force something seemed to give
  way his heart almost stopped beating
  there was a slight movement from with-
  in the breast of the sphinx and then a
  hum grew in intensity a low whirring
  noise which to him was a tolling clang-
  ing ring of the dawn of success he had
  found it he had found it

    it held him breathless he gaped at the
  hole in front of him his hair whirling

madly as long as the reverberation
continued he stared stupidly at the rock
but soon it died away with a flutter and
his countenance snapped back to normal
the manuscript flashed through his mind
this was but a part of the procedure
distinctly he remembered that he must
run toward the paw while the whir was
still loud he jammed the blade into the
groove again and like heavenly music the
grating sound beat on his ears

  he ran and stumbled through the sand
to the stretched paw of the creature but
as he reached there the noise died softly
away he paid little attention to it how-
ever seeking the farthest end of the leg
and feeling around it for an opening
through which to slide the knife this
time he worked with fierce purpose al-
ready he knew that he would find it some-
where  it would be only a matter of time
until he struck the right spot

  the masonry of the paw confronted
him with the same handicap the broad
breast had fissures and fissures he
disregarded the crumbling holes in the
stone which were not man-made and
sought a thin line which might be the
joining of two rocks and he found it
ordinarily it would have meant nothing
the insertion of the blade into that per-
fect groove and its sudden stop at some
hindrance but with a snap of his wrist
he heard an empty click and knew that
it spoke volumes for him

  but he didnt return immediately to
the gloomy spot beneath the breast he
threw the beam of his light toward it
speculatively measuring the distance from
paw to main body figuring the speed he
would have to make to work both ends
in time the main whirring he had dis-
covered continued uninterruptedly for
about twenty seconds and during that
period he figured he must have enough
time to dash toward the paw

  so he returned started the reverbera-

tion anew and ran pell-mell in a straight
line the unsteady sand under his feet
slopped against his soles retarding him
but he threw himself onward stumbling
forcing his way in a split second he
located the groove and jabbed the blade
into it and shoved hard the purring
sound suddenly rose in volume to a high
pitch he watched everything about him
breathlessly his clcctric light playing
brilliantly upon the massive paw

  the two slabs nearest him began to
slide birck ever so slowly like a vast door
to a vault noiselessly 

  there before him yawned a black pit
and as his torch flashed into it he sud-
denly perceived that the slabs were start-
ing to move back again it galvanized
him into action he leaped into the hole
felt his feet strike a pair of stone steps-
and then the huge portal closed upon his
back

  everything had occurred so spon-
taneously that he didnt have time to re-
gard the consequences once he was inside
with the opening closed it all came to
him now as he stood within the great
sphinx his light playing upon the flight
of steps and he whirled upon the great
door with his torch the rays struck the
barrier to freedom and bounded back at
him with a sardonic chuckle or so it
seemed to him there was nothing upon
it which might be construed as a key for
this exit the only thing he saw was the
hieroglyphic inscriptions which lined the
wall

  he shoved and pushed but there was
no result just as surely as if he had
entered his own tomb alive was he in-
carcerated here for a moment his at-
tempts became frenzied then he laughed
here he had hoped beyond hope to find
an entrance to get in now that he was
in he was trying to get out

  he murmured with a chuckle to him-
self afraid

the torch fell upon the inscribed
walls and he soon forgot everything
about him his scientific sense prevailed
and he stood there for the better part of
an hour studying those writings making
out the pictures he sent the beam down
the steps and saw that as far as he could
look the walls on all sides were marked
the place was chock full of the history of
egypt up to the time of cheops what
a find what a find

  his scientific mind swelled with the
knowledge what a sensation this would
create when it would be made known
what first-hand information was con-
tained here for a short moment it
seemed unreal to him-but there it was
it was overwhelming

  under ordinary conditions he would
have sat down note-book and pencil in
hand forgot his environment for many
hours but he couldnt do this now the
steps went downward straight away
from him he didnt know where he
was at the present time the hieroglyphs
wouldnt run away the thing to do was
to proceed

  the place was dry dreadfully dry and
dusty breathing was hard below his
feet was an accumulation of dust an inch
thick and each step of his shot particles
into the air soon he was sneezing and
gasping for breath and it got no better
as he advanced rubbing his smarting
eyes he walked smack into a blank wall
it was at the bottom of the steps at the
end of the sloping corridor

  he flashed his light upward and met
the blank musty stare of the stone roof
atop for a prowling moment he won-
dered whether this was one of those false
headings cheops had warned against if
it were he shivered it wouldnt help him
any that portal back there leered at
him with sardonic staunchness

  but it couldnt be he told himself he
had followed the ancient pharaohs in-
structions to the letter this could be the
the lost city



only way there must be some way of
getting out two openless walls stared
back at him fore and aft slowly he re-
traced his steps until he once more stood
at the barred opening and minutely went
over the walls and steps trying with the
knife which he had left in his belt-the
other sticking outside in the groove-to
find some crevice which might be the key
to it all but he was unsuccessful his
lungs were beginning to pant straining
from the airless tunnel gradually he
worked his way back to the other end of
the sealed passage suddenly he flung
himself backward with a cry and a
shudder

  his light was fixed upon an object he
iad overlooked which lay in the corner
it was the desiccated body of what had
once been a human being he bent over
it curiously as he touched it it didnt
fall apart as rapidly as he thought it
might though the garment which clothed
it crumbled up into fine dust its fea-
tures were indistinguishable somehow
this fellow had entered this approach and
had been unable to proceed any farther
he had perished like a rodent in a closed
box

the realization of that sent a
prickly sweat over his body the
dire predicament which mansfield had
unfolded upon himself now lanced him
every time he glanced at the thing at his
feet there was no exit from here he
sir john mansfield must perish in this
hole just as this man had it was in-
evitable tliat sly old scoundrel of a
cheops had simply concocted the story of
atlantis so that he might maintain some
earthly power after his death

  it was a hard thing to bear mansfield
gnashed his teeth in rage no he
wasnt going to take this as final cheops
couldnt be so cruel there must be some
way out of this there had to be this
was-horrible 

  the manuscript-what did it say 
every word was etched on his brain

the signs will lead- what signs

the englishmans eyes were shot with
grimness he clutched his breast it was
becoming harder to breathe with each
inhalation

  it was a miracle an answer to his un-
uttered prayer that turned his eyes upon
a spot on the blank wall a place he had
somehow overlooked his struggling
heart leaped at the sight of a fine slit
upon it next to it somewhat obscured
was an arrow which pointed toward it
the knife reached madly for it the blade
quivering as it stuck in the hole

  the next moment there was another
of those soft rumbles and the blank
wall swayed gently as though on a pivot
moving back upon an axle

  a genuine burst of relief fell from his
gasping throat as a current of fresh air
flowed into the passage mansfield
leaped through the entrance looking back
with sympathy at the figure which lay
upon the floor and the door swung shut

  he didnt need to tell himself that he
would have perished had he been forced
to remain much longer in there his
lungs expanded to a delightful freshness
that brought new life this new chamber
was not like the sealed one he had just
quit somewhere there crept through into
it a stream of fresh air

chapter iv

the priceless vault

the literary remains of ancient
egypt consist of papyrus manu-
scripts sculptures and tablets
found in tombs temples and ruins but
the earliest characters used by these
ancient people were the hieroglyphic in-
scriptions practically the earliest ones
date as far back as twenty-five centuries
before christ there had long been dif-


amazing stories

ficulty in reading those ancient symbols
but the fortunate find in the year 
of the rosetta stone in the rosetta delta
of the nile river furnished the key for
the unlocking of these treasures the
rosetta stone contained the equivalent
inscriptions in hieroglyphics and in
greek letters the meaning of the greek
being known the symbols were possible
of translation

  as sir john mansfield stood in this
large room his light picked out upon the
walls a complete history that dated back
further than any present day knowledge
of the ancient land the walls of the
chamber gave an indelible print of a de-
tailed recounting of human lives it was
far more valuable than any he had yet
seen almost thirty centuries before
christ this had been written and it con-
tained data of centuries before that
period happenings that meant more
to archaeological science than anything
else-

   it was impossible to evade it silently
his feet carried him around the four huge
walls and the electric torch was flung
up and down lighting up the clear-cut
writings time meant nothing to him
now hunger was a thing non-existent
from somewhere there circulated a thin
breeze which assuaged his desire for
water

  at every digestion of the knowledge
confronted he marveled at the many dis-
crepancies which beset the twentieth cen-
tury science and this was authentically
conclusive nobody on earth would dare
defy what was written hereon imagine
what this meant he exulted and it was
hours before he could calm himself down
to face the situation at hand though he
felt he could stay with this lore always

  the chamber though vastly high at one
end turned out to be about twenty feet
each way in rectangular shape at one
end the ceiling tapered down until it was
only about ten feet from the ground

the current of air came from somewhere
he reasoned it wouldnt be hard to dis-
cover the source of entrance

  and then he noticed that at the place
where the ceiling came down there were
four metallic pegs in the wall right under
one another he tried them in an effort
to discover their probable intentions
shaking them trying to loosen them from
their bed in the wall but they wouldnt
come loose nothing moved when he
hammered at them surely they were
there for some purport he said to him-
self regarding them intently

near-by right upon the opening
through which he had come he
pounced upon another one of those fine
slits and he applied his knife only to dis-
cover that when the slab-door pivoted
back it burst open upon the steps he had
so gratefully left

  for hours he searched diligently for
the source of the air for some slit which
would guide him outward he realized
now that there was bound to be one it
only demanded his constant exploring
and many times during those hours he
lost himself studying those priceless in-
scriptions that redundance of treasure
of mankind and nodded his head with a
smile

  it was tiring effort which kept culmi-
nating in failure the englishmans
knees felt shaky strange he removed
a large bandanna and wiped his brow
the shirt was soaked for all of the cir-
culating air realizing his weariness
mansfield sat down upon the floor re-
laxing against the wall with a sigh his
legs slid forward and he laid down the
torch for a moment he decided hed
close his eves for a bit of rest his arms
were awfully tired    tired 

  how long he slept he didnt know
when he opened his eyes and stared
blinkingly around him it was totally
dark the fog of morpheus was just
the lost city



starting to fade from his brain and he
sat up with a stall glancing around
frantically at his invisible surroundings
foi a good ten seconds he couldnt get
his bearings where was he this
stygian blackness what was it

  his hand reached out and brushed the
cold rocky walls and then it caine to
him from out of the eerie interment
which for a moment had seemed a
hideous possibility his fingers fell upon
the floor and encountered the torch
with a relief he grasped it and snapped
it on but no beam of light radiated
from the battery he had forgotten to
turn it off truly he had slumbered
many hours the battery had burned
itself out

  for a moment panic seized him then
he laughed there were still several in
his pocket it had been a fortunate fore-
sight which had prompted him to add
those to his equipment quickly he took
one out and clicked it on the bright
powerful beam was the prettiest thing
he had ever seen the feeling of security
reverberated through his entire body

  he arose primed for anything dis-
tinctly it returned to him how his efforts
to escape from this chamber had been
futile there seemed to be no way out
of this underground vault if he couldnt
find some opening ahead hed have to go
back to that passageway of steps and
make a final effort to get out that way

  his light flashed its way around the
room up at the ceiling and he saw the
exit as clearly as though it had been
pointed out to him he grumbled at his
sightlessness probably due to his en-
thusiasm over the heiroglyphs

  the ceiling as it fell from its great
height didnt touch the top of the short-
est wall he moved away into the center
of the room to get a better view right
over the place where the four bars of
metal were imbedded in the rock and
about two feet over the top one was a

narrow opening the light of his torch
flashed toward it but the angle barred a
clear view

  how could he get up there then it
dawned upon him that the spikes of metal
were there for that purpose what a
fool he had been he tested the lower
one by putting his whole weight upon it
it budged not a fraction of an inch
here was the solution it was a form
of ladder

  his fist wrapped around the next rung
and repeating this he dragged himsel f to
the height of the wall carefully guarding
the torch which he had clipped to his
belt at the top he gathered himself so
that he rested on the topmost rung se-
curely affording his arm free motion
and he lanced the small aperture with the
brilliant yellow rays it appeared large
enough for him to wedge himself
through and he forced himself into it
and dragged his body along the shelf
was cushioned with a heavy layer of dust
which rose around him choking him

  crawling as he did he couldnt help
but think if this were the form of
progress which cheops had created then
surely that great personage must have
bellied along here the same as he it
was a curious form of travel mansfield
grinned perhaps the royal character
had desired that others prostrate them-
selves ignobly in some such fashion
what a humorous king of egypt

he reached out to support himself
for the next wriggling process but
nothing was there feeling around his
fingers lodged on the rim of the narrow
ledge he had come to the end the
light flared out-into space downward
he looked perceiving the outlines of a
vast room and right beneath him were
more of the metallic bolts he leaned
out grasped the top one worked a leg
loose behind him and dropped on the
metal in a twinkling he was down

surveying the interior and an ex-
clamation fell from his lips

  the chamber was not like the cold and
bare one he had slept in and just left
its walls were streamed in gold and silver
tapestries fabric which looked as though
it might have been draped resplendently
a short time before the illumination of
his light brushed against it and ferreted
out the brilliant and iridescent gems
which were ingrained in the workings
ruby- and amethyst- and emerald-colored
stones sparkled back at him from their
ancient repose blinking at him with a
new-born fire it was a gorgeous blend
of color which was cast everywhere

  in the middle of the room sprawled a
long low ebony table piled high with
dust and upon it rested several massive
chests of the same black wood a half-
dozen strangely fashioned seats squatted
around the low-slung table

  he touched the fabricated walls in
the places where the tapestry was cloth
he poked a hole right through but they
were few it was mostly an artistic
spinning of thready gold and silver
clinging together defying the ravages of
time it was truly a masterful piece of
human ingenuity nothing like this had
ever been found before the tombs
which dotted the sahara desert which
spoke after countless years the incompre-
hensive words of yore crushed by that
very weight what artistic messages were
contained within them

  the chests on the table bore the in-
evitable inscriptions cheops cheops
the place reeked with the fellow here
he had inscribed what he had segregated
as the best of his art vandalism could
not extend to this spot what a fore-
sight he had possessed

  with abated breath he threw back one
of the lids the chest was filled to the
brim with fancy and beautiful objets
dart a craft which had never been

evinced to any degree by any of the later
dynasties of egypt or of any country
benvenuto cellini the italian master of
the renaissance would have knelt at this
shrine and wept with abandon he
would have shamefacedly ground into
powder his humble offerings to the world

mansfield reverently picked one
article out a small urn carved
from a precious gem and it seemed to
him as he stood there with the light
focused upon it that it quivered like a
thing coming into life a word speaking
from an animate heaven it was com-
pletely translucent woven and cut in a
golden splendor that broke into thousands
of prismatic pin-points never had he
had the pleasure of holding in his hands
an object so transcendingly beautiful

  he laid it away with utmost care and
inspected the other superb articles of
hand-wrought sculpture they were
priceless beyond the human craftsman-
ship of any living person museums all
over the lands would have mortgaged
their last asset to possess any one of these
their monetary value-sir john mans-
field gave it litde thought this aesthetic
accumulation was too real a fact for him
to think of anything else

  for the first time a sharp pang as-
sailed him and he sat down upon one of
the odd chairs he must have been
down here for a long time why he
could move around here for days and
days and not know the passing of time
the only thing which would bring it to
him would be the emptiness of his
stomach his throat was terribly parched
from the particles of dust which had
scattered from their dormant bed into
his nostrils and mouth for only one
drink of cold clear water-just one long
gulp

  he glanced about the chamber which
he had been the first mortal to have
entered for almost five thousand years
the lost city



and at the far end he saw something
dark and void-like he stared at it keenly
leaping to his feet quickly he sped
toward it

  it was an opening about four feet
square he got down on his knees
flashed his torch through it there was
a sloping descension in a moment he had
forced himself through crawling and
then he swung upward the light he
could stand up the roof was about ten
feet above him

   there was nothing to keep him back
now and he ran down the sharp grade
straight down it led him a passage that
was kicked into dust as he left it behind
him yet the current of air remained
with him coming from the unknown
source and that aided his discomfiture
immeasurably his pulse quickened as he
thought of a goal near-by something
seemed to tell him that he had left the
hardest part behind him

  he stumbled upon something and
paused to pick it up it was a large gold
ring something which might have
adorned a regal garment etched in silver
probably it had fallen from that majestic
personage thousands of years ago as he
had gone through there mansfield
dropped the ring into his shirt pocket

   the torch suddenly dimmed and gave
out and he was in total darkness again
confound it he said impatiently it was
supposed to possess long life working
the button with his thumb brought forth
no answer and he tossed it from him
snatching out his last one hed have to
make haste now that was plain if this
torch gave out as did the others he
would be caught down in this terrifying
darkness and nothing under the sun would
help then he would never be able to
find the slits which worked the movable
slabs hed just flounder around until a
benign hand saw fit to take him merci-
fully out of life

wiftly he ran this passage had
to end somewhere it couldnt be
far and as he fled along his light picked
out something totally dark about fifteen
feet ahead just like the open mouth of an
abyss and he gasped throwing himself
back his momentum aided by the
grade had been such that he slid almost
to the very brink of disaster and his
right leg did fall over the chasm before
his bleeding fingers managed to hold him
back his breath was coming in spas-
modic gulps

  slowly he lifted himself and reached
for the torch which had fallen from his
grasp thank god it hadnt broken
or gone out or fallen into that yawning
hole

  he dropped to the edge and peered in
the sides were very smooth and they
went downward to an unpenetrable depth
he couldnt make anything out the hole
was about ten feet square and was at the
end of the passageway where to from
here

  he spun the beam around the walls
feeling positive now that he knew
cheops fondness for slits that he would
find it and right near the pit he saw
the thready arrow which pointed toward
the groove he pried the thin spot with
his steel blade

  there was a sudden grinding sound
much more intense than any of those he
had listened to before but he couldnt
see anything occurring he gazed with
preoccupation upon the walls gray and
unmoving they simply stared back at
him coldly under the light of his torch

  there was something moving and he
whirled something was coming up the
pit near his feet gradually he could
make out a moving substance as it lifted
toward him it seemed to be a landing
stage that was rising ever so slowly
presently it reached the top even with
the floor of the passage and stopped
the void was completely closed up


amazing stories

   his brow furrowed into a puzzle to get
the meaning of this he stood with one
foot firmly on this side of the stage and
braced himself trying with the other to
discover whether the top of the movable
slab would bear his weight and it did
lie stamped with both feet upon it but
it didnt move he walked around it
inspecting the wall beyond it for what
might lie there but saw nothing

   the knife was still protruding from the
deep slit and he contemplated it specula-
tively the thing appeared to manage
everything maybe it would help him
out now with both feet firmly stand-
ing on the stage he rcached backward and
shook the blade instantly he felt him-
self dropping

  he flung backward to be in the middle
of the slab of stone down down it
went after about a hundred feet of
slow dropping it picked up acceleration
and fell like a plummet mansfield was
thrown to the rock with a force that
knocked his head spinning

  it must have fallen six or seven hun-
dred feet but it took only a few seconds
so great was the speed mansfield clung
to the floor of the flashing vehicle shak-
ing his bruised head his breathless
body felt a gradual cessation once more
his bleary eyes raising to watch the walls
move up and past him

   then all of a sudden he broke out into
the open into what looked like a million
lights and there rose before him the
screeching and cv ering voices of thou-
sands of throats milling before his
clouded eyes was a vast throng of men
and women

chapter v

the lost city

sir john mansfield stood
and gaped at the crowd the clear
invigorating breath of air forced
itself through his dust-coated contracted

lungs he gasped and gasped his head
felt of a sudden so light and odd there
was a clutching griping ache in his abdo-
men and head he tottered on his feet
as he left the elevator and stepped upon
the ground it was the last he knew as
he pitched over on his face   

  some time later he stirred a hand
was trying to force water through his in-
credibly parched lips and down his
throat for a while he lay still and
sought to acquaint himself with his en-
vironment

  a delightfully soft lounge was like
balm to his tired and aching muscles and
its soothing miraculous salve crept over
him as he lay relaxing even his eye-
lids were too weary to remain open
though he licked eagerly at the liquid
which the hand was pressing through his
swolffcn mouth his lips smacked with
the cool refreshment each drop instilling
him with a new-born strength

  presently he opened his eyes blinked
them he seemed to see two persons
sitting near him and then with a clarity
he perceived that at the head of the
lounge sat a girl with a dipper which oc-
casionally brought more water from the
bowl upon the table near by sat a tall
haughty figure with his eyes fixed in-
tently upon the englishman

  mansfield felt his head throbbing vio-
lently he fingered it and found a large
welt that must have been some bump
he had received probably it was that
which made him feel so lcthargic now
but this water was genuine strength
every trickle brought a deeper breath

  the man who sat near him he saw
wore a loin girdle that was made from
some light metallic cloth which suggested
a tenuousness as it fitted around his pow-
erful hips the peculiar thing about him
was the milkiness of his skin and as he
moved in his chair and rose to the sump-
tuously rugged floor there rippled from
beneath that feminine-appearing flesh a
the lost city



superb set of billowing muscles his
massive shoulders were the animate
nry upon which was perched a manly
head of exquisite proportions especially
that blonde hair which was combed back
with meticulous precision and neatness

  the room was built of some metal
mansfield noticed as were most every-
thing else of solid nature within but the
beauty which was strewn about in the
articles of furniture was of a strange de-
sign he had never seen the type a
brilliant effulgence lit up the entire
chamber

and then he turned on his side to take
i a glance behind him a sharp
breath fell from him up to now he had
only seen the arms but now he was as-
tounded at the pure whiteness of the girls
skin the immaculate beauty of her ac-
quiline features she was looking at him
anxiously a pair of bluish eyes like pools
of liquid sapphire her hair was coiled
at the nape of her head and it was blonde
the same as that of the man her gar-
ment fell from the soft contours of her
throat and ended a little below her knees

  the man said to him how do you
feel

  sir john mansfield leaped from the
lounge in one gesture with a cry

  egyptian the ancient tongue
the man was speaking in the old lingua
with a metallic cadence

  there was surprise too upon the
others face also upon the girls there
seemed to be a fervent light in their eyes
that mansfield had been able to under-
stand them and he did not for years
had he devoted himself to the study of
this tongue without picking up as he
could the conversing in it the milky-
skinned man heartened by the response
talked to him and though mansfield
couldnt get each word distinctively he
managed to secure the trend of thought
it was a beautiful tongue mansfields

aesthetic heart beat appreciatively he
absorbed it greedily

 who are you where am i he
managed to ask realizing his incompati-
bleness before the mastery of this man

  i am yuxa high priest of atlantis
this is my daughter venia you are at
present in the chamber of the temple of
the gods my own upper chamber

  atlantis atlantis he had almost
forgotten that he had once upon a time
set out for such a legendary objective
then cheops was right that papyrus
had stated the truth when it had declared
the existence of atlantis it was here

  he fell back upon the lounge to gather
his thoughts for a long while his di-
lated eyes swung from the magnificent
handsomeness of the man to the dazzling
radiance of the girl the high priests
daughter atlantis it was hard to
convince himself that this really existed
these superb creatures it was almost
impossible yet he didnt have to pinch
himself to know that he was in the midst
of the truth

they fell into a conversation the
high priest and the man from the
outer world it was an effort on the part
of both to acquaint themselves with each
others discrepancies of speech yet they
soon fell into a clear understanding al-
ready mansfield was finding this man
and the girl who said not one word but
sat by gazing raptly at him different
from any possible conception he had ever
had of ancient egyptian high priests still
he said to yuxa he couldnt understand
why a man of atlantis spoke the tongue
of a land which had existed long after
the disappearance of their own race-a
supposedly fictitious race

  but the high priests eyes were con-
centrated upon him in a strange manner

  sir john mansfield he said simply
the people of atlantis honor you for
ages and ages we have hoped beyond

hope that from the world above would
come some messenger who would con-
quer the signs of cheops our father and
come to us we have yearned for word
from above never has it come

  the scientist creased his brow if it
had been possible for him to get in it
stood to reason one might get out

  i dont understand

  yuxa raised a bejeweled hand you
arc the conqueror of time since cheops
was blessed to descend to us since the
time he conceived the idea of constructing
the great god of silence upon the burn-
ing waste of the desert and thus closing
up the only entrance to this wonderful
land here since the period in which he
inscribed the papyrus with the only means
of entering atlantis-it has been since
then that we have stood by with the
knowledge that at some time a brilliant
mind would come to us

tn reverence to our holy father
a cheops we kept his wish that at no
time should the mechanism which con-
trolled the slits above- be neglected for
this mechanism is the only medium which
permits one to operate the above openings
in the great gnd at the very first move
of your knife our plate showed that
someone had read the manuscript and was
coming down to us the people of at-
lantis have been standing long at the
landing stage waiting for you there
were times when we thought you had
succumbed up there unable to proceed-
like that other happening long ago
mansfields head was in a whirl but
he couldnt displace the picture of that
shriveled body boxed and snuffed out in
the steps-passageway the revelation
that a mechanism controlled those en-
trances and that it was actuated by the
men of atlantis far beneath dazed him
it seemed hardly realistic too fantastic
yet he did not doubt the word of the high
priest for a moment

  yuxa was continuing we hail you
my man your wish is to be humbly
obeyed by us

  the scientist was on the verge of put-
ting his previous question to the man
concerning the strange language which
should not have been a part of them
when there sounded a click and a portion
of the wall slid back revealing two huge
docile blacks who entered and bowed ob-
sequiously carrying large silver platters
of steaming food the sight of the
savory dishes made sir johns mouth
water the food was not familiar to him
but the odor drifting from the vapory
concoctions sent a permeating desire
scurrying through his body it had been
long since he had partaken of food
yuxa and the girl moved their chairs
closer

  eat my friend we shall do like-
wise

  the englishman fell to like a starved
creature the warmth of the first dish a
soggy but extremely delectable substance
touched the right spot within him and he
hurried on to the next he drank deeply
from the tinted goblet which contained an
exotic bluish liquid that burned like fire
as it touched his tongue but which
drifted down his throat with the potency
of an elixir his famished body ab-
sorbed the food avariciously yuxa sat
by eatng sparingly appreciating the
others persistence

  tell me yuxa why do you call
cheops the father

  the high priest gave him a solemn
look it would give an insight into the
history of our race i shall explain it
to you long ago our people were many
we lived on the face of the earth and
were content history has brought down
to us however that some cataclysmic
transition was being undergone by the
earth great crevices appeared vast
stretches of land fell away into profound
valleys and many of them did disappear
the lost city



altogether beneath the countenance of the
mighty waters during one of those
transformations practically our entire
race was lost beneath the sea

  we were a mighty race the absolute
ruler of both white and black when this
convulsion had subsided we were left
with but a pitiable handful of what had
once been civilization and power and
then this remnant of people gradually
found itself being forced back into the
inland of the continent and where there
had previously stood mighty cities there
now appeared the gloomy wastes of burn-
ing sand nature was making up its
mind apparently to conquer us once and
for all time

  the men women and children were
soon quartered upon the earth in a spot
about where we are now and as time
went on it was becoming terrifyingly evi-
dent that the land was falling the prodi-
gious plentiful land which produced our
every want and filled every need and
slowly from the west there rose toward
us the terribly destructive sand it crept
closer and closer until it finally threatened
to make our entombment but a matter of
time something must be done and that
quickly

i

you will probably understand our

  i scope when i say that at the time we
had developed an intricate system of
tunnels which extended underneath the
land in far reaches there we harbored
the recalcitrant blacks the slaves and
the tunnels were operated by them there
was metal in plenty in the earths bowels
varieties of rock and earth which we had
learned to segregate into elements and
recompose for other uses the blacks
were trained in this work it was really
in the underground that our pulse of
existence was contained

  we finally faced the alternative of
creating a habitat below or to allow our-
selves to be picked off by the metamor-

phosis above so we rounded up large
colonies of blacks for workers and
created this mighty city here our men
of learning realized though that we must
at no time be close to the face of the
earth there were too many dangers in
that

  but there was left one spot through
which we might at some time go forth
that was the one through which you
came after ages of life here we sent
several men through it and then came
cheops you know i presume of that
he met our high priests and scientists
who welcomed him like a long-lost
brother he taught us the science of his
own race we were greatly superior to
him however nevertheless he gradu-
ally acquired the sovereignity of atlantis
gave unto us his own religions organized
us into a unified whole we even speak
the language of the egyptians the tongue
of ancient atlantis is no more

  cheops pointed out to us the princi-
ple which existed on the earth-the sur-
vival of the fittest he told us that the
people above were constantly warring
amongst themselves that greed was pre-
dominant it would never do for us to
leave our dwellings here and go above
again and we were glad of his interven-
tion

  true we have our own turbulences
here but they are solely between the
whites and the blacks and the highly
developed mind of the white man of
atlantis can at all times cope with the
black evil we keep the black colony
sectioned off by the man-eating matter
those who are our servants are completely
docile they are under our hand and
will

  sir john mansfield masticated his food
slowly absorbing the words of the
speaker the explanation given by yuxa
held him being a scientist he readily
understood the drastic step which had
been forced upon the remaining people


amazing stories

overtaken by the predatory sand it
seemed quite plausible it fully explained
the foundation for those legendary ru-
mors of a continent buried beneath the
atlantic ocean it seemed highly prob-
able now that he pondered it that a
remnant of that race had survived for
ages and had been injected with the fact
but die years of assimilation with the
other rising peoples had induced forget-
fulness and had perfected the fact into a
theory which gradually descended the
ladder of time and became a full grown
myth with no evidence to prove the
statement

the knowledge of the actual exist-
ence of atlantis left him cold this
civilized people had then been throbbing
in full force and splendor when accord-
ing to the debatable theological belief
man had started to crawl around in his
heavenly garden upon earth they had
been infinitely superior thinkers when the
long-decayed civilizations had thought
they were at the apex of their prime

  suddenly a voice pervaded the entire
room and mansfield saw that yuxa and
venia stiffened their heads bowed in
reverence

  the voice said yuxa the council of
the men of learning and the priests are
convened below to hear the story of our
distinguished and honored guest sir john
mansfield pray take him hence

  long after the voice had died into
nothingness did the tvo hold their heads
lowered mansfield kept flashing his
amazed eyes around the room for some
explanation to this marvel from the
very walls this utterance had come

  finally the high priest rose and donned
a short cassock which fitted him snugly
he scanned he englishmans face and
stated

  ra has spoken

  the stranger to the land shook his
head to clear it what was all this foolish-

ness ra speaking the very idea made
him burst forth into an inward smile ra
the supreme deity speaking from his
heavenly throne ha he shook his
head that such highly intelligent men
might be hoodwinked as this

  but mansfield kept his face free from
his thoughts he understood now that
he was being regarded highly by these
men it wouldnt do to tread upon their
beliefs from the very first he would
be frowned upon suspicion would be di-
rcctcd upon him and he was already
beginning to like this friendly and honest
soul that was yuxa he told himself
somewhat abashedly that if he kept glanc-
ing any more at that incredible goddess
near him he might be subjected to the
base ignominy of an eye-strain and that
positively wouldnt do he needed his
eyes now in the greatest happenings of
his life one of the foremost discoveries
of all time he must refrain from eying
the graceful figure who was possessed
of an artistic superbness that was bril-
liantly unearthly

  come ordered the high priest we
go

chapter vi

they proceeded toward the wall
and mansfield gazed questioningly
as he saw yuxa stalk straight at
the doorless obstruction just as he
reached it a panel slid back and a large
opening appeared the englishman
halted in astonishment at the apparent
miracle and yuxa looking back quickly
understood he laughed and beckoned
him closer pointing to a small colored
niche in the wall he bent over and
strctched a thin elastic covering which lay
over a small bulb it was yellowish and
flashed brilliantly

  every room is like that sir john
mansfield all the corridors are too
when you perceive the niche and walk
the lost city



straight at it the emanating waves from
your physical body are picked up by this
supersensitive globe it controls the in-
tricate mechanism which unlocks the hid-
den panel kneel over and i shall show
you    ordinarily it is of dull yellow
color but our bodies are so close that
it is operating up to its capacity

  it was stupendous thought the scien-
tist the photoelectric cell acted in sim-
ilar fashion dependent upon emanating
waves their very knowledge of it raised
his esteem of them immeasurably they
were truly a modern people

  the upper portion of the temple which
the trio were now vacating shaped up as
a gorgeous outfitting of religious designs
and garbs mansfield found himself go-
ing through resplendent interiors one
after another individually they were
the shrines of the gods which were wor-
shipped devoutly

  the most superbly fitted was the
chamber of ra at one end was a golden
throne of fine carving next to an altar
the high priest informed sir john that it
was for the eternal repose of the great-
est of all divine beings always occupied
by ra

  never stated the tall blonde man
reverendy has anyone ever seated him-
self in the throne ra may he ever look
upon us with a benign eye sits there for-
ever and ever

  in rapid succession followed the
chamber of osiris with an immense
effigy of an ox suspended aver the altar
of isis who had originally been the god-
dess of the earth but later was enthroned
upon a lunar heaven the room of the god
canopus with the four corners sub-
merged in water of aelurus the egypt-
ian deity who had originally been a gor-
geous diana but to be unmolested by the
giants had transformed herself into a cat

  all of these figures mansfield recog-
nized with a glowing heart his archaeo-
logical findings had brought him face to

face with many of them  scientific lore
had given him a clear depiction of all of
them

  well did he realize what this meant
from the standpoint of knowledge
never had he or any other living person
stood in chambers of worship real as
this it was with reluctance that he
left them behind

there was one however which
held him a while suffusing him with
strength and power as he gazed upon its
massive import it was the covenant of
chou in the egyptian category he cor-
responded to the reman hercules an
immense figure of stone stood in the
middle of the room on it was inscribed
a prayer form sir john mansfield gazed
at it covetously but a nudge at his elbow
made him continue on his way

  he walked steadily downward to the
council room his brow furrowed in
thought the honor of being permitted
residence in the temple of the gods was
something out of the ordinary only the
high priests were afforded entry into the
shrines that he had been taken above
here showed the respect they had for him

  atlantis it kept ringing through his
brain without ccase he had discovered
the lost race-and found a people wor-
shipping deities absolutely foreign to
them atlantis men and women who
prayed to egyptian gods what power
that fellow cheops had to rule over
a people far above his own in intellect
how had he done it

  he thought they were never going to
stop going downward when he came out
of his muse he raised his head to find
himself in an immense room flooded with
light and replete with humanity at the
sight of him voices broke into a din that
was deafening he blinked to relieve the
strain of the brilliance

  around the hall were seated many men
in the middle of the room was a large


amazing stories

table around which squatted more yuxa
moved to the head of the gathering
beckoned mansfield to him gradually a
stillness dropped upon the audience

  for the first time mansfield had an ex-
cellent view and study of the men of at-
lantis it was a peculiar thing he noticed
how they all seemed alike in their hand-
someness and physique tall bodies of
powerful construction physiognomies
sculptured of magnificent animate ma-
terial the assemblage of men was
enough to make him intake his breath
sharply

  he heard yuxa talking paying tribute
to him and then after a while he
found himself on his feet speaking
slowly trying to find himself in words
his eyes were roaming on the eager rapt
faces they wanted to know everything
and he started in to give it to them

  but like a thunderclap every head
dropped mansfield standing alone
heard a profoundly raucous voice break
upon them

  arise men of atlantis the blacks
have risen

  again that same voice  what potency
had it that made everybodys head bow to
his breast so awedly yuxa had told him
that ra spoke thus from his eternal rest-
ing place the englishman wondered

but the next instant as the tone had
died away every man was on his feet
the blacks had risen the white men
were pouring out in a mass and mans-
field found that yuxa was leading him
out by the elbow through the door by
which he had entered with venia on
his heels the high priest ran upward into
the temple he pattered quickly after
them

  the blacks again snapped the high
priest they must be subdued

  flitting after yuxa was in itself an
arduous task he whirled on like a mad-
man presently mansfield found himself

in a small chamber yuxa ran quickly
to the wall and pressed something in-
stantly a large section slid back and be-
fore them stretched an open vista of an
illuminated country it was the city of
atlantis

  mansfield ran to it and peered out
far beyond he saw a crazy twinkling of
lights from all the houses men were
dodging in and out they were carrying
small cylinders in their hands speeding
toward that mad flickering of yellowish
green lights yuxa brushed by him hold-
ing too one of the weapons with which
all of the men below were armed

  closer and closer came the flashes un-
til mansfield soon visioned a large mass
of black men steadily forging onward
with a grumble yuxa tossed the cylinder
from him and ran out in a few mo-
ments he was back again roiling a large
machine quickly before him he kicked
the cylinder out of the way and centered
the large thing out over the city then
turned its nozzle down upon the mass of
men below

  the fighting was fierce now he heard
venia ask her parent how did the
blacks get so many cylinders

  the high priest shrugged his shoulders
his blue eyes were gazing steadfastly at
the struggle the mass of mpn was com-
ing closer with each ensuing moment
mansfield saw beneath him huge blacks
nubian in physique he had seen two
of them earlier when they had brought
into the chamber the food but they had
possessed docile faces those below were
brutal-appearing in every respect they
smacked of evil and were of savage as-
pect

  mansfield perceived a strange thing
about the battle all of the whites were
armed with cylinders but only a few
of the blacks were possessers of the same
the rest toting long glistening knives and
metallic clubs

  from his vantage point he asked him-
the lost city



self whether this was a childish prank of
some sort the whites were shooting
rays at the blacks without apparent effect
the blacks were mowing down their foe
with slashing blades and felling clubs it
looked a massacre and his eyes popped
the advantage was all with the invaders
that ray business was no good at all
what was this foolishness

yuxa clicked a lever and from the
mouth of the machine there spewed
forth the same yellow-green spray but
it had wide latitude it gathered in the
entire mass of fighting men

  its all over now the high priest said
calmly those simple-headed fellows
do not realize that they have no chance
all the time they attack against one-sided
odds it is foolish of them

  but the englishman was watching
closely and it was far from being over
the two bodies of men were one whirl-
pool of seething humanity the whites
sending thir constant rays into their at-
tackers without damage the blacks with
their few shafts doing the same it was
the wielding of those large blades and
clubs which wreaked the greatest toll
the whites were falling slashed and
bleeding the blacks hardly injured it
was very evident in the face of this that
the battle wouldnt last long

mansfield whirled on the high
priest it is terrible why dont
you stop the slaughter look the
whites are being driven back the clubs
and knives are knocking them to pieces
the high priest didnt move from the
scene he pointed look

  and sir john did look the thing was
turning into a rout a farce the blacks
were falling in great numbers and noth-
ing seemed to have struck them all
down the line they were dropping heavily
to the ground those in the rear in-
stantly gave up and retreated with a

celerity that lost them to view soon the
englishman stood and gaped at the sud-
den change of affairs

  what-what was that  he demanded
in wonder they-they werent even
touched

  yuxa laughed the rays paralyzed
the blacks paralyzed the whites par-
alyzed everyone

  it was true the men of atlantis were
falling white and black what was this
did these men have to kill off their own
just to bring down the foe it looked
ridiculous

  the high priest must have understood
the others quandry he smiled

  they are paralyzed but not injured
all will be brought back to life very soon
our men will be going about their duties
shortly the blacks will be quartered

  mansfield stared over the edge of the
temple and saw that already large groups
of whites were beginning to clear away
the many men lying prone on the ground
within a brief space of time the earth
was clear of bodies and had not one
seen with his own eyes that battle he
would never have thought that a conflict
had been staged

  the high priest snapped the weapon
shut and rolled it away mansfield
glanced around and saw that venia was
gone too the scientist leaned on the
parapet in thought but he got no time
for meditation for yuxa appeared again

  the black invaders are a strange type
sir john curiously enough there is
a large colony of them beyond the man-
eating matter it keeps them incarcerated
nothing can conquer that grayish matter
-save one thing and that is a certain
emanation it devours everything else

   but the blacks managed to secure those
rays and thus get through the man-eating
wall the blacks which we have here
with us are vastly superior to the belli-
gerent ones you just saw of course
they were all alike once but through a


amazing stories

process which i shall show you later we
subjugate them for our needs but there
are some blacks who for some reason or
other fail to react properly to our treat-
ment and it is these we have to contend
with they discover where our rays are
hidden and manage to get them out to
their brethem but they are really fool-
ish they cannot defeat us much as
their greedy natures would desire that

hy dont you clean them out once
and for all time mansfield in-
quired it would save you all this worry
and trouble

  they are harmless we could wipe
them out for good but we dont want
to while they abound in their natural
grounds we can learn their habits and
study their minds their brains are an
open book to us we simply endure their
tendencies even to our occasional disad-
vantage

  the high priest wiped his brow
though his mien had at no time showed
acute trouble mansfield saw that the
problem of the blacks was a source of
displeasure to him it was he who stood
at the head of his people and it was to
him that they looked in time of danger

  sir john asked how about those who
are severely wounded

  yuxa gazed at him they are easily
repaired it is only those who receive a
deadly blow that we can do nothing for
you will see

  and again as they stood there there
came to them that voice it was by now
rasping upon mansfields nerves though
the high priest with his customary awc
dropped his head

  the dungeons are ready yuxa the
blacks are ready to be transformed
proceed

  the englishmans narrowed eyes
probed every comer of the room the
dead-sounding tone spoke through the
walls everywhere but his prying

glances found no opening nothing

  what mysticism was this that spoke in
any room though the very walls that re-
ceived reverent oheyance yuxa had
calmly said that ra spoke but that was
utterly too ludicrous to believe though
he wanted earnestly to believe this hon-
est-faced man the high priest of atlantis
he scoffed at the idea that it was a
heavenly voice it was ridiculous

  that yuxa had nothing to do with this
deception was clear mansfield saw it
would take more than that to make him
humble himself like this at some trickery
he was aware of yuxa had told him that
this same voice had spoken down through
the ages to every generation of atlantis
from the day cheops had died there
was something ominous about this and
the more mansfield thought of it the
less he could understand it being a
twentieth century scientist he longed
avidly to hound this mystery to its source
but being also an honored personage in
this holy temple of the gods he realized
too that it did not give him reason to
misapply their trust in him

  yuxa strode to the panel come sir
john

chapter vii

the dungeon

through a labyrinth of corridors
they went to pause before a large
rectangular glass the high priest
pressed a projection on the wall and the
glass suddenly became animate a sta-
tionary picture flashed into view and
after a glance at it yuxa pressed again
and a sectional panel glided back noise-
lessly

  mansfield perceived a large platform
which led out over a ten or twelve foot
drop they went on it and the opening
slid back behind them yuxa led him to
the end of the stage and he saw a large
the lost city



cylinder that seemed to be some sort of
vehicle up ahead situated every fifty
feet or so were large circular rings of
metal braced on stout pillars which were
rooted firmly in the ground far down
the lighted tunnel those circular rings
appeared at regular intervals

they entered the car and the high
priest approached a large bulb sim-
ilar to the one which activated the hidden
panel and turned a switch then he
waved his hand over the reddening ball
in a flash the car whizzed away it sped
speedily through the suspended circles
which yuxa explained as magnets oper-
ated by the bulb it was more ingenuity
of the atlantis mind

  the speed of the magnetic car was tre-
mendous as it whirled through the giant
rings at one time the vehicle suddenly
came to an easy stop and mansfield saw
through the glass partitions that they had
reached an intersection and that another
vehicle was whirring by and in the
next instant they were continuing their
joumey downward

  along the brilliantly lighted walls there
appeared occasionally large stretches of
transparent glass which showed subter-
ranean chambers and several times many
men were to be seen at work there soon
they were passing chamber upon chamber
and slowing down the car gradually
came to a stop and yuxa moved toward
the entrance

  a large portion of the wall of glass
now showed a jumble of men mansfield
went through the panel and found him-
self in a huge underground cave-like in-
terior which had dozens of illuminated
entrances through which men were en-
tering and leaving

  but what absorbed his interest was the
number of surly blacks who were
crouched shackled against the walls it
was the dungeon which harbored the cap-
tured men and lying upon the floor

were many whites who had just been re-
leased from the paralyzing ray by the
counter- and antidotal emanation they
were lounging around gathering once
more their strength watching haphazard-
ly the proceedings which were about to
begin

  at the entrance of the high priest and
sir john mansfield the hubbub subsided
yuxa paced the vast hall mansfield fol-
lowing upon his footsteps the high
priest gazed occasionally at some feature
of a black who was fastened securely in
chains then strode on

  yuxa addressed a man similarly garbed
as was he a youngish appearing fellow

  kodro are they all here 

  he nodded all the blacks are here
those who are injured are in the indivi-
dual chambers awaiting your leisure
good

  a large group of men gathered
around them many straightened up and
left hurriedly for other parts yuxa
started at the nearest black

  at the silence which ensued among the
whites there rose from the captured
throats a vicious and malevolent abuse to
which no attention was paid the whit-
ish pupils of their dark eyes were shot
with imprecations their thick voluptuous
jowls slobbered with anathema their
ham-like hands clenched and unclenched
with a spasmodic desire to tear and rend

  yuxa moved hesitatingly by each one
eying every attractive feature which
might be made use of mansfield noted
curiously that he paid no attention to
brute strength it seemed that the high
priest was trying to segregate those with
some human nature in their physical con-
struction

at a gesture of the high priest a white
would focus his cylinder upon the
fellow until he slumped unconscious in
his fetters then two others would lift
him to their shoulders and carry him out


amazing stories

those who were passed by raised a bed-
lam of menacing snarls

  it took several hours for yuxa to make
the entire round of the chamber more
than fifty likable prospects had been sat-
urated with the devitalizing ray and had
been taken forth the high priest nodded
almost imperceptibly to kodro then
turned to mansfield

  now you shall see how we do away
with these creatures it is the most hu-
mane passing for them they are too
base for our needs and will be better off
where they are going

  there came through the portal at the
far end a large contraption on wheels
with kodro moving actively about it di-
recting its slow progress the crate-like
construction was shining with a bluish
light from the outside and the men
steered it with the utmost care into the
middle of the room a hush came over
the blacks as they viewed it

  mansfield could not make out the con-
tours of the thing the strange creamy
azure effulgence lay over it all the cap-
tives eyes were shot with terror they
knew what that object was that stood near
them gone was their struggling spent
was their smoldering hatred present was
a terrifying palsy that wracked their
brawny bodies

  a white reached up and unlocked a side
of the big box on wheels and with the
release of the heavy door slid out the
bluish light clinging however to the
opening as it swung there staring out
from the center was something grayish
which bubbled seethingly

  the deathly silence was split as the
blacks renewed their fury putting forth
their utmost strength in an endeavor to
release themselves from the links the
sight of that grayish matter had imbued
them with a ferocious maddening
frenzy they shrilled ear-splittingly roll-
ing their blood-shot orbs insanely

  yuxa moved down and pointed at

one he said the high priest

  the huge negro was suddenly set
upon by a half dozen whites and loosened
from his fetters he fought with utter
abandon to free himself of the many
hands which held him safely cried
begged wheedled he twisted and con-
torted his body the whites lunged to-
ward the thing on wheels lugging their
load of human flesh and bracing them-
selves before the aperture they heaved
him directly into the grayish matter an
unearthly cry burst from him as he
slopped into it	-

  mansfield unnerved by the procedure
stared at the sight of the black body plop-
ping into the stuff the head and the
right arm struck first sticking in it like
glue the gray matter started to spread
over covering him up and slowly there
began before mansfields eyes the com-
plete dissolution of the black body

  the matter ate him up as it burbled
over him and in a short while there was
nothing left in view other than a black
shank in a moment it too was gone
the drab essence kept reaching out re-
flexively for more unsatiated

co this was the man-eating matter
 what a demoniacal means of eradica-
tion mansfield shuddered what could
that stuff be anyway it looked like
some sort of malignant animal matter
he fell back from the thought of putting
that through a microscopic study

  as he watched he noticed that the
thing was starting to creep from its shal-
low depository in the crate on wheels
kodro slammed sbut the door with the
bluish emanation after a short respite
he opened it again revealing the settled
organism huddled in the center

  the blacks were glaring at each other
vividly aware of their own impending
fate and they knew that nothing could
help them now

  yuxa said to mansfield the man-
the lost city



eating matter is tlie only thing that cow-
ers these brutes there is a ribbon of
this stuff separating the black colony
from the white it is controlled by fixed
rays of this bluish light the blacks can-
not get out unless they secure cylinders
of this ray which they often do

  but what is that awful thing the
englishman persisted

  in some ways it has been a good thing
for us sir john i dont know what it
it aeons ago our scientistswere experi-
menting with animal cells and thought
they had struck the crcation of life they
concocted a large amount of the matter
and settled down to wait for the outcome
they had visions of creating man-im-
agine that you can easily wonder now
that youve seen it work why it was that
the whole land wasnt eaten up the
matter started in to devour everything
after a while if it hadnt been for the
fortunate discovery of this repellent ray
life would have succumbed here it is
the only thing which keeps it in check

  the process of eliminating the blacks
was continued but mansfield turned from
the sight with a shudder and strolled ab-
sently toward a lighted portal this was
getting him upset it rasped on his sense
of fairness but diese men knew what
they were doing it wasnt often that
such a potent weapon was at hand with
which to fight the foe the whites were
not to be condemned for the practise

  the strange feature of that thing was
its unquenchable hunger it took body
after body into its grisly inhuman mouth
enough in quantity to displace its own
mass yet it didnt seem to get any
larger or smaller its convulsive motion
kept calling for more and more gray
hideous matter good lord another
shudder shook him

  he was glad he had left the vast dun-
geon behind now that he was strolling
down the lighted tunnel he couldnt
stand the sight of the thing men were

moving about constantly they went-by
him bowing respectfully his move-
ments were free from surveillance he
was one of them a high member

  the scientist warmed at their reception
and acceptance and he began to look at
them clearly it wasnt a recalcitrant
gesture or revenge that prompted them to
do away with the captured nubian crea-
tures it was only that they- wanted
freedom for the proper outlet of their
own cultured expressions the blacks
were a constant thorn in their sides

  and yuxa was a splendid fellow he
hadnt at any time forced upon him a
command of any sort the high priest
realized the difference that might exist
between his people and those up above
he was lucid-minded enough to let him
follow his own inclination people down
here didnt eye everybody else with sus-
picion they lived like one vast family
in contentment and harmony

  a nd then there was venia-he won-
jcv dered where she had gone f rom that
upper room in the temple during the im-
broglio well hed soon get a chance to
get amongst the dwellings of the whites
and become friendly with the people he
could study their habits their likes and
dislikes see what sort of family life was
being lived

  he was thus draped in thought when
his eye halted at an entrance into a small
chamber there were many bodies of
white men there slashed and clubbed un-
consciously recumbent upon slabs of rock
around them were several handsome men
chatting at the sight of him they rose
instantly

  mansfield nodded to them and entered
he surveyed the injured men several
he noticed were in critical condition
nothing was being done to them

  why are they permitted to lie like
this they wiu die

  no sir john one man said they


amazing stories

will not die those large bulbs overhead
are spraying their mangled bodies with
a light that keeps the wounds from mak-
ing any progress from deteriorating we
await only yuxa they will be on their
feet in a short while

  mansfield gazed at one body with as-
tonishment a mans whole chest was
laid open he could even see the aorta
leading to the heart

  he will die

  the white shook his head with a smile
no it is not fatal

  he sat down and rested himself on a
stone bench shaking his head in puzzle-
ment this would be interesting to watch
if they ever patched up that fellow or all
of these men they were master minds

  presently the high priest strode in and
his eyes lit up with pleasure as he saw
mansfield

  thought i had lost you sir john
immediately the men about him began
straightening up the man on the slab
nearest to the door his head had been
slashed from brow clear to the back
skull was clearly fractured yuxa and
another tall man with him scanned the
injury carefully

  against the wall was a case in which
were many strange types of instruments
of surgery from the ceiling fell a whole
array of bulbs of many designs the
tall man reached up and brought down a
tube which he snapped on it buzzed
with consistency as a dazzling white
light sped from a small hole in the center
the thin beam was allowed to play upon
the cloven skull while yuxa busied him-
self with the instruments

  he selected a sharp one obviously a
scalpel and unmindful of the noisy ray
which was playing upon the fracture cut
loose all shredded flesh and bone at one
place mansfield saw that there was at
least a half-inch of brain matter open to
view the high priest with sure and ex-
perienced hands removed all foreign

matter from the wound the steady gush
of the ray held by the tall man flowed into
the injured place what it did the en-
glishman couldnt perceive but he did re-
mark that not one drop of blood had been
shed in the operation

  when yuxa had finished his work of
delicacy he straightened up another
bulb was brought down it was oblong
in shape with a long handle from its
base the lengthy stem was fitted into
a groove at the head of the slab and
turned on from its ugly mouth there
issued a deep red which suffused the en-
tire head of the unconscious man

  mansfield bent closely to watch the
effect upon the open cranium slowly
ever so slowly just as though a new
growth was being manufactured the two
edges of bone were coming together an
astounded exclamation sprang from him
it was incredible unbelievable his eyes
were upon the wound searching for some
tell-tale evidence that a cavity had been
there long after the hole had been cov-
ered up but there was nothing abso-
lutely nothing the skin and bone had
come together and the head was as normal
as his

  he stood up eyes glistening what
miraculous craft lay here what super-
human beings these men were think
of it this would have been a fatal case
upon the earth surgery such as this had
never been seen and it was the rays-
rays-rays the men of atlantis were
literally composed of rays

yuxa was at another table working
the tall man came back and surveyed
the head he nodded to himsel f snapped
off the rays took out yet another bulb
and flashed it into life it was the anti-
dote to the paralyzing emanation for the
large frame of the reclining man went
through a shudder his muscles flexing
and reflexing presently his eves opened
he stared around him sat up with a jerk
the lost city



in a jiffy he was off the slab and walking
around smiling

  just like that it was almost uncanny
nobody paid any attention to him on
earth the fact would have been spread
to every corner of the world the high
priest didnt even lift his head from the
mangled leg he was working upon

  and then mansfield saw that body
whose chest had been laid open while
he had been gasping over the repaired
head yuxa had finished the man and
gone on he stared at the chest in won-
der the reddish ray was spraying it
there wasnt anything there which would
have pointed to a former wound

  sir john mansfield went from table to
table as in a dream soon the slabs were
becoming empty and live healthy hu-
mans were filling up the room when the
last man had bounded from the slab and
stretched his arms he turned to the high
priest but yuxa said preoccupiedly
now for the blacks

chapter viii

the brain process

the chamber wherein the blacks
were secluded was a more tempes-
tuous place dozens upon dozens
of men were entering and leaving all
around the walls were limp forms of the
blacks who had been picked from the cap-
tured group they were still under the
influence of the paralyzing ray save for a
half dozen or so in one corner who for
some reason liad not been subjected to
the unconscious state these set up a
noise which almost deafened mansfield

  there was a large table directly in the
middle of the room toward it hastened
the high priest arranged upon a small
slab was a neat row of more instruments
already there reposed upon the table a
gently breathing figure of a black some-
how in his sleep the fellow didnt appear

so vicious and wicked there was a
somnolence in his features

  a liquid from a flask was poured upon
his hairy head and as the whitish buzz-
ing bulb sprayed upon the skull every
hair came off like a peeled skin leaving
the flesh bare for operation

  ill explain the method yuxa said
to mansfield we discovered through
minute study of the brain that every lobe
is there for some purpose in one there
is contained the factor which controls the
working of nerve coordination in another
is sorrow and so forth there is a cer-
tain group which caters to emotion in
the operation which i atn about to per-
form you will notice that i remove but a
small portion of one of the lobes it is
one of the group of emotions one which
reacts to hatred revenge lust and so 
it is that essence of discontent which
must be withdrawn before the black can
be of use to us now watch

  it happened so fast that the scientist
barely got a view of what the high priest
did the scalpel made one quick incision
into the bone which was like soft putty
under the ray the deft fingers laid back
the ends of the flesh and bone not one
drop of blood was evident

  with another slender instrument of
the type of scissors he delved into the
narrow aperture and with a quick move-
ment flicked out a piece of whitish matter
that was no larger than the shred of a
finger nail again he did tins then
with expedition the reddish light focused
itself upon the wound a new flesh and
bone coated over the severed lobe

  it is simple continued yuxa the
sections which compose the brain are
after all but fountains from which arise
every emotion or basic action of the hu-
man body why shouldnt we strike at
the source always instead of prowling
ineffectually in case of need this fel-
low rom now on will retain every sense
which he had hitherto been subject to


amazing stories

but when it comes to the display of those
negative features which i mentioned he
will not take part

   the bloodlessness cried mansfield
 how do you accomplish that

that is controlled by the absorp-
tion rays which that beam of buzz-
ing light produces it sutures every inci-
sion instantly softens all bone and flesh
immediately for the path of the knife
the blood vessels are not tampered with
it also controls the temperature of the
body keeping it in normal state always
the red ray here creates a rapid growth
of superficial flesh which will suffice ade-
quately until the natural process brings
about a full recovery at no time is there
any danger or discomfiture to the pa-
tient

   the blacks respiratory organs were ris-
 ing and falling steadily he was released
 from his catalyptic stage and his eyes
 fluttered open yuxa shut off the rays

   just watch his actions

  the black bolted upright grinned
sheepishly at the men around him he
dropped off the table and gazed inquir-
ingly at the men chained to the walls
presently he strolled over to the few
black men who were conscious and talked
to them their reception of him was a
fiery and blasphemous curse upon his
head he had desecrated his blackdom
but he was indifferent to that casually
he spoke to them of their incarceration
everything seemed to be perfectly normal
to him

  it was at that moment that a huge
negro tugging violently at his chains suc-
ceeded in breaking loose for a moment
the actual freedom dazed him then
with a tremendous cry issuing from his
lungs he leaped through the air his
writhing post-like arms tensed for the
unwary figure of the high priest down
upon him he came

the place was in an uproar the
whites stared at this instantaneous
occurrence rooted immovably even when
the snaky fingers of the prisoner sunk
into yuxas neck in an attempt to tear his
jugular from his throat the high priest
taken at such a terrific disadvantage was
pawing the air his legs sliding from un-
der him his head was being forced back
and his eyes were distended

  with an unconscious gesture mans-
fields hand shot downward to his hip
with the same motion his revolver flicked
out and he fired since he had entered
atlantis the presence of that weapon had
almost been forgotten it was only when
his hand brushed by it that he was cog-
nizant of its contact with his hip but
now-now he was thankful that he had
had the foresight to equip himself with
it

  the massive black his insane eyes
glued murderously upon his victim sud-
denly relaxed as blood gushed from his
head he released yuxa who tottered
with hand clutching his bruised throat
the black fell prone upon his face

  the sound of the exploding gun
reverberated throughout the room and
everyone suddenly stopped dead in their
tracks frozen with surprise at the sight
of such a deed suddenly done a body
sprawled upon the floor they whirled
with mouths agape to stare at this
stranger to atlantis holding his hand
over a stick which spat death

the high priest came slowly toward
mansfield eyeing him intently and
looking at the weapon

  what power you hold in your hand
my man you have saved me from a
beastly finish  i have often won-
dered what that was which clung to your
mid-body may the gods preserve you
a deep sigh fell from his lips

   and with that he came to the stranger
 and encircled his shoulders with a quiver-
the lost city



 ing arm an absolute act of brotherhood
 the high priest looked at his fellow-men
 and bowed they nodded in silent respect

  mansfield felt somewhat foolish stand-
ing there with the gun and having the
men bow before him he knew that they
werent paying tribute to his magic it
was only their utopian spirit which spoke
at the saving of their leader their eyes
were suffused with affection comradely
worship he slipped the gun back into
the holster

  later when the work was finished in
the dungeons and he was taken back to
the chamber where the men of learning
and the priests were convened again he
had to show them what power really was
contained in his noise stick he had
to explain to them the intricacies of gun
powder the mystery of how the steel
jacketed bullet was expelled through the
medium of the gases formed by the de-
composition of the same powder he
took a stand away from a wall and shot
once at it then he held aloft the re-
trieved misshapen bullet passed it around
for all to see and it was clear that
they understood him this new-fangled
thing wasnt beyond their receptiveness

  mansfield enlarged upon the daily ex-
istence of the races upon the earth and
they sat by with studious quietude
there was no greed or conquest in their
gaze nor envy of any superiority which
might exist rather they beamed upon
learning that a civilized people existed
and not a bestial people like their own
blacks

  one scientist arose and desired to know
whether it might be possible for the men
of atlantis to be received cordially and
without malice upon the earth

  sir john mansfields face warmed
you will be the greatest guests man has
ever received your accomplishments
are of a high order and with your
capacity to absorb there is no reason for

your not acclimating yourselves immedi-
ately

  that brought a shattering din they
clapped and pounded then they wanted
to know was he a disciple of their gods
did all the people above recognize ra
as their supreme being

  no replied mansfield calmly and
he went into a dissertation of the types
of worship engaged in even with that
there was no abatement of the elation
which had electrified them they had
been secluded underground for thou-
sands of years and to change their abode
to a more advantageous place was some-
thing that thrilled them immensely

  the cheering and yelling was snapped
off like a breath a raucous voice burst
in upon them there was a harshness in
the intonation an admonition

  people of atlantis ra has heard
the tale of the stranger he has received
the enthusiasm the white men have for
a new home listen closely my chil-
dren ra does not doubt for one moment
the truth as stated by the courageous sir
john mansfield but ra is the supreme
being of the universe and ra does not
wish that his children leave the land of
their own making you shall not go
forth ra lias spoken

 the voice that infernal thing
mansfield stood at the table and observed
how a thrilling sensation could be nipped
in the bud the faces which were bowed
now rose from the breasts the counte-
nances impassive it was a simple mat-
ter to see that they accepted ra and his
word as final

more than ever now did the
englishman long for some clue
which would dislodge that voice he
yearned to hound it from its lair ra
tomfoolery rot there was no such
thing someone was making high pleas-
ure of these splendid men of atlantis
someone-but good heavens that


amazing stories

someone had spoken to these peoples
ancestors for milleniums what was it
that possessed such a supernatural power
to speak through the walls through the
very passing of time

  it was a genuine puzzle to the scientist
one moment his brow creased with
scorn the next he was ready to admit
that he was wrong in his supposition if
only he could find whence that voice
came but the very walls were non-
productive they told not of the secret 

  and the whites accepted it without
query they submitted to everything it
said with a finality that mansfield found
overbearing

  ra guides our fate yuxa said with
awe he is our supreme deity cares
for us from the heaven he does not
wish us to leave here that is definitely
settled

  there was utter faith in his statement
in his calm eyes

  and then things began to happen

the ultra-qamma wave

many of our stories describing interplanetary war make a very liberal use
of rays as being the weapons of offense where ships out in space are fighting
one another but in this interesting narrative while the ray appears and
does its work the actors in the story never leave mother earth we have
had a number of our best stories from physicians and here again is one of
that cult favoring us with a very interesting production

            by d e winstead md

                      illustrated by morey

i closed the switch and pressed
ray trembling hands hard to my
ears to shut out the shock of the
explosion there was a muffled
roar a swish of air against my
face and a great spurt of dirt and debris
hurtled high into the air to fall in dust
and twisted wreckage quite near the
sheltered spot where i stood

  it was done and i heaved a sigh of
resignation i could relax now for the
first time in many days yes i could
surely rejoice now that it was all over
with the terrible instrument of destruc-
tion and with it the most enticing temp-
tation which is has ever been the lot of
a poor gullible human to shoulder was
gone forever

  i closed my eyes for a moment and
reviewed it all with abated breath the
promise of unlimited wealth the acclaim
of millions along with the curses of other
millions the possibility of almost abso-
lute dictatorial power and world domina-
tion with princes kings and statesmen
alike hastening to do my bidding

  for weeks these visions had assailed
me and it wasnt easy to repudiate it all
but now that it was done my confidence
in my own sanity at least was restored

the strain of holding in balance for so
long the fate of the entire world its civ-
ilizations its traditions its hope for the
future is quite enough to make one a bit
mad at best

  but my relief from mental anguish
was not to be so easily attained after
sleeping the dock around i awoke to a
feeling of remorse and a sense of great
personal loss the flitting away at once
of all the desires to which the flesh falls
heir is not to be erased from the mem-
ory at one fell stroke as i was to learn

  my sigh was almost a sob as the reali-
zation bore in upon me that the ultra
gamma generator was destroyed that no
one in all the world hut me knew of its
having existed my long dream of wealth
and power was ended and here was i
penniless prematurely gray unloved un-
heralded and sick i who but a few
hours ago held within my hands more
potential power than it was ever the lot
of man to hold before and now i was
but a puny helpless worm whose great
sacrifice must remain forever unsung

  and so the visions of what might have
been continued to come unbidden and
my efforts to comfort myself with the
counter vision of my hands stained with


the ultra-gamma wave

  the shocks were somewhat less violent now and before i realized what
  he was about farley sprang to his feet and started running toward a high

pagoda nearby
the ultra-gamma wave



innocent blood of a disrupted world
where misery terror and panic ran rife
brought me but small respite

  depravity maybe but try and put
yourself in my place and see how it feels
to slough off ten fold more than your
fondest dreams have ever pictured it
was the only really big thing id ever
done in my life and yet i was regretting
having done it it is easy enough to see
that i had done the only square thing
there was to do under the circumstances
and id have been a poor specimen of
man to have done otherwise but with
the instrument of realization in your
very hand and no one to gainsay or
advise you it isnt easy to be consoled at
having rejected it believe you me
brother it isnt easy

it was on a day in june  that i
first met gerald farley in the sea-
port city of victoria hong kong china
he was stout middle-aged and slightly
gray at the temples-a chemist in an
english sugar refinery with a deal of
liberty and a daughter who had spent
the past three or four years with him in
the orient

  my good friend lieutenant sharp of
the uss victory had referred me to
farley in my quest of employment i had
met with reverses in recent years and my
reserve funds were running alarmingly
low

  you will find farley a very admir-
able gentleman advised sharp his
anti-japanese sentiments are a pet ob-
scession of his which he discusses only
with persons of discretion and one
which we who know him best have
learned to smile at and overlook dont
let his views influence you too much

  farley seemed more than pleased with
my references i am sure you and i
can come to terms dexter he told me
my daughter is leaving me in a few
days to return to the states and i shall

require an assistant in my private lab-
oratory she has conducted this lab al-
most independently for the past three
years what spare time i have had has
been given to an invention of my own
of which i shall probably tell you more
later in the meantime please do not
mention it to anyone

  when all the details of my new posi-
tion had been discussed and an agree-
ment reached i arose to go

  just a moment dexter said farley
id like you to meet my daughter

  he left the room but was gone only
a few moments when he returned and a
slightly built young woman followed him
in she was blond probably twenty-
three or -four years old her flaxen hair
was cut in a sort of freakish bob from
the blue depth of her eyes she smiled a
most cordial greeting in all she seemed
rather coquettish and not at all what i
had expected to see in the person of a
capable spinster who could so efficiently
conduct a first-class modern chemical
laboratory unassisted

  lucile this is mr lon dexter he
said who will take over your work in
the shop my daughter lucile dexter
she will be with you for a few days un-
til you get the hang of our routine

  somehow my surprise seemed to have
robbed me of my senses i was speech-
less and thought i must be staring very
stupidly true i had never seen anyone
before quite like lucile farley but at
that the sight of her shouldnt have
robbed me of my wits yet i must ad-
mit that she was stunning i recall won-
dering vaguely how i could ever have
thought hong kong a dull place and i
recall experiencing a keen sense of regret
that she was leaving so soon but aside
from that my thoughts and actions for
those few moments are rather vague

  at length i managed to acknowledge
the introduction in some manner i do
not recall what it was that brought a


amazing stories

laugh to her lips but at any rate the
laugh served to reassure me bring my
pulse-rate back to something near normal
and enable me to think clearly once more

for all of that night and for many
succeeding nights and days as well
the lovely vision of lucile farley was
ever in my mind why  had i met this
maiden before in some previous incarna-
tion was she that kindred spirit  had
sought so long in vain was it the call
of fate which had brought me to the
orient for the sole purpose of contact-
ing this kindred spirit  then why was i
to lose her again so soon

  i had no concrete idea that i was in
love with her and yet i knew that she
had impressed me as no one else ever had
and for the life of me i did not know
why

  i had not been in farleys employ
many days before  sensed that his pri-
vate laboratory was not the real reason
why he had employed me he manifested
little or no interest in my work in the
shop as he called it he had resigned
his position with the refinery soon after
his daughter left and was spending all
his time in his study at his home pre-
sumably with his invention which he had
cautioned me not to mention

  i knew that my employer had some-
thing on his mind but i carefully
guarded this knowledge from him i was
not surprised however when he sum-
moned me to his study one day some six
weeks after i had entered his service

  your knowledge of chemistry dex-
ter he said with the air of one who is
about to unburden himself has sur-
prised and delighted me for candidly
i did not secure your services with a
view to continuing this laboratory of ours
very much longer i felt that you could
be trusted and i am greatly in need of
the help of someone whom i can trust it
is a matter of vastly more importance

than that dinky little shop could ever be

  that is the reason i sent lucile
away so that i may carry out my plans
without her suspecting anything amiss i
do not want her to be worried about such
matters you see and of course she
would be gravely concerned about my
personal safety if she knew the truth

  the truth dexter is this for sev-
eral years i have been attached to the
u s intelligence service and in tliat
capacity i have learned a great deal that
those at the head of our government at
washington do not know nor will they
believe it when i report to them

  ever since the world war the japs
have been making colossal preparations
for a most destructive war against the
united states even now their factories
are running to capacity night and day
manufacturing munitions and battle
planes they have realized what our
leaders have not been brought to see
that the battleship is obsolete as the fac-
tor of paramount importance in modern
warfare they plan to utterly demolish
several of our largest cities simultane-
ously in such manner as to discourage
any concrete idea of concerted resistance

  recently because i reported this
truth or what my investigation led me
to believe to be the truth i was dis-
charged from the intelligence service
my reports were not confirmed by other
investigators they say

  so you see i am now a free-lance
and in that capacity i very foolishly
wrote a series of articles for one of the
leading american magazines concerning
this jap menace and although i took
every possible precaution to prevent their
being traced back to me i have reason
to believe that they have been traced
they have put japanese spies upon me
and now  fear that they have learned
of my invention

oh yes i said i recall that you
told me of an invention which you were
the ultra-gamma wave



working on and have the japs stolen
it

  no i do not think they even have
any idea what it is if they did they
they would make a more concerted ef-
fort to obtain it i have been very care-
ful and they have learned nothing defin-
ite but they are suspicious and upon
two occasions they have tried to kill me
i sat up at once with renewed interest
indeed then why havent you told me
of this before

   candidly i wanted to be sure of you
i do not mind telling you now that i have
investigated you thoroughly  as i said
they are suspicious and are watching me
for that reason i dare not try out my
little instrument now that i have it per-
fected to determine the extent of its
effectiveness

  then you do not know whether it
will work successfully or not

         yes i know it will work success-
fully and effectively but just how
much improvement i have achieved over
my earlier models i do not know the
japs must not get this machine dexter
it is most important that i get this instru-
ment to america as soon as possible and
i want you to help me to do it

   of course ill do anything i can i
said but if it is an invention pertain-
ing to warfare you have not only the
japs to think of but the english customs
inspectors as well if it is as important
as you seem to think why not destroy it
and rebuild it after you have reached
america

  both points are well taken replied
farley earnestly it would be almost but
not quite as bad if it were to fall into
the hands of the british and it was my
original intention to do as you have sug-
gested but i have reason to believe that
japan is almost ready to strike it takes
months to construct this instrument com-
pact though it is

   and you think that this instrument
would thwart them in their designs upon
our country if they have any i asked
unable to conceal my skepticism

   there is no doubt on that score i
know it would i have chosen to call
this instrument the ultra-gamma pro-
jector it projects a vibratory wave
which is away and by far the most de-
structive agency known to man

  ah i exclaimed with renewed in-
terest then you have indeed devised
one of those death-ray machines which
we read of in pseudo-scientific fiction
no dexter it is by no means a death-
ray and i dislike to call it a ray the
wave which it emits is so far departed
from the light-spectrum that such no-
menclature would be incorrect i named
it ultra-gamma in the days before i
realized how vast was the gulf between
this wave and the gamma ray of radium
you see i have been playing with this
power for nearly eight years but i have
learned only recently how to direct and
control it it has very nearly killed me
a dozen times

   at first i too thought it was a ray
and i called it the ultra-gamma ray
but it does not cause any fluorescence of
sensitive chemicals nor does it act like
any of the vibratory rays akin to light
for the sake of euphony i chose to ig-
nore the vast gap between it and radium
and merely changed the name to ultra-
gamma wave

   but i objected if it does not af-
fect a photographic plate nor fluoresence
sensitive chemicals how under heaven
did you discover it

   by its effect upon certain forms of
inorganic matter

   oh then it will disintegrate matter
no it does not disintegrate matter
it merely causes certain forms of mat-
ter to vibrate with such rapidity as to
be very destructive to the surrounding
material either organic or inorganic al-


amazing stories

though it has little or no effect upon
organic matter per sc otherwise i would
not be here to tell about it it merely
shakes the foundation from under or-
ganic matter to be exact 

tithat form of matter is most ef-
fectcd by this wave i asked
still barely able to avoid showing my
skepticism

  silicon he replied without hesita-
tion i can shake the foundation from
under the largest building or an army
as you will in less than an hour

  yes i was indeed skeptical but i was
fascinated was this strange man really
in possession of such a device or was he
merely a madman with delusions of gran-
deur and persecution his story was
fantastic enough to justify the suspicion
of paranoia and yet his earnestness was
most convincing

  but enough of this resumed far-
ley we must get the ultra-gamma pro-
jector to america and my plan is to dis-
assemble it in part so that it will appear to
be nothing more than a very ordinary
radio set that should get us by the cus-
toms inspectors for they are not sus-
picious also i shall leave here a partly
dismantled radio set to create the impres-
sion that it was radio i was experiment-
ing with and that my device was unsuc-
cessful and has been abandoned that
for the benefit of these japanese spies
who have shown so much interest in me
then we shall go by way of japan visit-
ing yokohama and tokio to further dis-
arm suspicion

  have you ever seen these spies you
speak of i asked casually still not
knowing whether i wanted to believe or
discredit him

  no but one of my operatives has
he chased them away upon two occasions
after they had taken a shot at me it
seems they are rather bad marksmen

  i tried to dissuade farley from return-

  ing to america by way of japan if lie
really had in his possession such an in-
strument as he claimed i was most anx-
ious that none but my own country might
fall heir to it i think anyone would
have felt that way and i thought that
the quickest and shortest route home
would be the safest

  but i am sure i am under surveil-
lance dexter he argued and if i
were to attempt to sail to san francisco
direct i fear my frail bit of strategy
would not be sufficient to deceive these
jap spies and too i want to meet
charley ling at yokohama charley
ling is an operative who has worked
under me in the u s intelligence ser-
vice for the past year and a half he
has some data which we dare not send
by mail and he cannot come to me just
now i am most anxious to obtain these
data which i hope to use in writing more
of my series of articles in an effort to
induce the american people to demand
an adequate aerial defense against an-
nihilation at the hands of some more ag-
gressive power the ultra-gamma pro-
jector you see is effective only for pur-
poses of invasion you could not bring
down a plane with it though of course
so long as other powers know that such
an instrument is in our possession there
will be no attempt at invasion and it
is in my series of articles yet to come
that i intend also to publish the truth
about my invention once it is safely
in the possession of our war depart-
ment

  werent you afraid to trust a jap
in the matter of collecting evidence
against his own country

  charley ling isnt a jap he is
chinese a very well-educated man
ton and his hatred of the japs is ex-
ceeded only by his untiring energy and
his faithfulness

  and so it was that on august 
 we sailed up rippling bay and
the ultra-gamma wave



 landed at yokohama the customs
officials were the very last word in
courtesy and their inspection of our lug-
gage was but meagre their attitude
as a whole was quite disarming to such
contentions as farley had been advo-
cating

  we were conveyed by jinrikisha to a
hotel the name of which i have forgot-
ten but it was equipped with modern
conveniences and afforded a magnificent
view

  here at about ten next morning we
met charley ling he was distinctly
chinese though garbed in western dress
of this i was glad for as yet most
of the natives i had seen wore almost
no clothing or thronged the streets clad
in jackets sans trousers

  he spoke excellent english with al-
most no accent but there was a cunning
furtive glint in his almond-shaped eyes
and his squat round figure seemed to
convey a lynx-like slyness that i disliked
instinctively in short i formed a sub-
conscious distrust of charley ling upon
first sight

  farley though appeared to have al-
most unlimited confidence in him and
they conferred in private for more than
an hour

  does charley ling know anything
about the ultra-gamma projector i
asked when the chinaman had gone

  he knows nothing about the nature
of it im sure replied farley but
in any event his only interest would be
his friendship for me

  did you have other operatives when
you were in the employ of the govern-
ment 

  two others at one time or another
but both worked under charley ling
charley is equal to a dozen ordinary
operatives he has channels of infor-
mation that would amaze you verily
charley ling is a wiz

  i had to smile at that one and not

  only because farley so seldom indulged
in slang no doubt i returned but
i wouldnt believe any unproven state-
ment of his if your data regarding
jap propaganda are based only upon in-
formation received from charley ling
i vote to destroy the ultra-gamma pro-
jector and forget how it was constructed
it is far too dangerous and destructive
an instrument to be placed at the dis-
posal of any war-like power even at
that of our own country unless grave
danger threatens and frankly i
wouldnt believe charley ling if he were
sworn by the most sacred oath in the
temple of the bronze buddha that you
and i have seen

  farley turned upon me almost angrily
he surveyed me thus for a moment
then smiled indulgently why you
have seen charley ling but once dex-
ter he replied while to me he is
an acquaintance and friend of long
standing who has proven himself in many
ways he has saved my life upon two
occasions strange lucile too had
that same unfounded prejudice against
poor charley oh well we americans
are so accustomed to thinking of the
chinaman as an ignorant coolie that we
just cannot realize that all chinese
arent like that

  perhaps you are right in this in-
stance i replied resignedly but i
am seldom wrong in my first impres-
sions and i still maintain that i wouldnt
trust charley ling as far as i could
pull a rikisha up yonder bluff and that
isnt far upon a day like this

next morning we were up early
to finish a sight-seeing tour by
rikisha which we had started the after-
noon before we enjoyed the quaint
scenery immensely and returned to the
hotel shortly before noon

  we had locked our valuables in a
strong trunk and we fancied them se-




amazing stories

cure but imagine our consternation
when we returned to the room to find
that the lid had been forced and the
trunk stood open

  my god exclaimed farley the
projector he rushed frantically to
the trunk and began rummaging inside
it he was right the ultra-gamma pro-
jector was gone

  it is gone he cried hoarsely the
japs they have found it

  i was terrified until this moment
i had been skeptical skeptical regard-
ing the effectiveness of the ultra-gamma
projector skeptical of farleys sanity
skeptical of charley lings faithfulness
and sincerity and most of all skeptical
about farleys flaunted jap propaganda
but if the thing were important enough
to induce them to purloin it in this man-
ner-why then perhaps-

  i brought myself up suddenly in the
course of my gloomy forebodings for
i had sensed a distinct and familiar odor
it was a peculiar perfume scent that
had been one of the things i had dis-
liked about charley ling he reeked
with the stuff

  charley ling i shouted cant you
smell that damned perfume find
charley ling and you will find the
ultra- gamma projector maybe though
he lias probably hidden it ere now
nothing else had been taken who-
ever burglarized that trunk came for the
ultra-gamma generator farley seemed
upon the verge of apoplexy

  hurry i shouted not far from
frenzy myself lets go question the
proprietor we must find charley
ling

  our room was upon the second and
top floor and we descended the narrow
flight a lot too fast for safety

  we reached the foot of the stairs how-
ever without accident and then some-
thing happened

  there was a roar a crash and both

farley and myself were literally hurled
to the floor

  i leaped hastily to my feet and as-
sisted farley to rise but we had no
sooner gained our feet when we were
again hurled down this time something
fell from the wall or ceiling and struck
me on the left shoulder my arm went
numb and i experienced an excruciating
pain in my left side i tried to rise
sagged ard fell again

  this time it was farley who helped
me to my feet i couid scarcely breathe
because of the pain in my side

  what the hell is going on here i
grated between gasps but no one seemed
to know farley grasped my arm and
hurried with me toward the nearest exit
we reached the open just in time to see
a building across the street rock crumple
and fall to the ground with a roar we
were thrown to the pavement and for a
moment i could not breathe

  then i looked back at the hotel it
was wavering and tossing like a ship in
a storm i called a warning to farley
and began to crawl away from the struc-
ture

wf hen i had regained my breath i
  rose to my feet again only to be
sent reeling and fall after taking a few
steps farley though as yet uninjured
had fared no better than i but together
we managed to scramble across the nar-
row street and away from the hotel
which was the only two-story building
in the block as i recall it

  we had barely made our way across
when the hotel came down with a crash
but crashes and roaring were quite com-
monplace now as this and that structure
trembled rocked and was hurled flat
pandemonium reigned everywhere i
saw men and women running in all di-
rections and that in the wildest sort of
panic i heard screams and cries of
anguish mingled with the crash and up-
the ultra-gamma wave



roar i saw mangled forms of human
beings and some werfe crushed beyond
all hope of recognition

  again and again farley and i were
hurled down upon the littered street at
length we desisted in our efforts to stand
and sat gasping upon the ground

  farley had grasped a handful of sand
in that last fall and now i saw him look-
ing at it with an expression of the most
profound horror  have ever seen de-
picted upon a human countenance

  i had collected my wits somewhat
its an earthquake i shouted holding
on to his arm with my right hand

   it isnt h he screamed pointing to the
sand in his hand its the ultra-gamma
wave look

  the moist sand in his palm was quiv-
ering and rolling like something alive
but i did not catch the significance of the
phenomenon then

  youre crazy i protested this
part of the earth is subject to earth-
quakes

  not to quakes like this one for after
all it is an earthquake but i tell you it is
being produced by the ultra-gamma
wave i saw that phenomenon once
before when i was hurled down and
caught up a handful of mud and with
that tip i devised this gauge

  his hand went into his pocket and
he withdrew a small glass tube filled with
a substance which looked like sand i
ican tell the direction from which the
waves come with this

  by heaven dexter you were right
it was charley ling who stole the pro-
jector the japs would not use it to
destroy their own country what a fool
i have been i told him too much and
he learned more the skunk

  the shocks were somewhat less vio-
lent now and before i realized what
he was about farley sprang to his feet
and started running toward a high
pagoda near by

  with a cry of warning i ran after
him determined to catch and draw him
back out of the way of danger but my
injury slowed me to such an extent that
farley outdistanced me despite his age
and build

  come quickly he yelled he is to
the west of us he isnt far away and
with this gauge i can locate him when
you see charley ling shoot first and
investigate afterward and when you
shoot shoot to kill we must get him
or hell terrorize the whole world the
damned chink

t te was soon slowed down to a rapid
- walk and i overtook him but
again his earnestness had reassured me
and i made no move to stop him we
hurried onward toward the west as rap-
idly as we could and i loosened the
service automatic in the shoulder holster
underneath my coat

  i shall not attempt to describe the aw-
ful scenes i beheld upon that westward
tramp how far we traveled i do not
know it seemed ages that we tramped
along upon the verge of exhaustion
hurled down frequently only to arise and
stagger onward there were natives en-
trapped by fallen timbers and by fire
who called out to us piteously for the
help we dared not spare the time to
render there were even little children
along the way that must be left to their
fate for the safety of the entire world
hung in the balance and haste was most
essential

  let it suffice to say that it was per-
haps an hour of the nearest approach
to hell i have ever known

  we passed beyond the limits of the
city for some distance and then in the
middle of a clearing we saw a small
hut with thatched roof and numerous
openings in lieu of windows there
were several growths of shrubbery scat-
tered about and farley whispered a


amazing stories

warning to proceed with care as he be-
lieved the rays issued from that hut

  we concealed ourselves behind this
shrubbery as much as possible but there
were times when we had to expose our-
selves to view from the hut in order to
approach nearer

  it liad been quiet for some moments
and farleys gauge failed to register any
disturbance so we reckoned that the pro-
jector had been turned off at least tem-
porarily

  we were within about thirty yards of
the hut when suddenly farley staggered
and crumpled forward upon his face as
simultaneously there came the crack of
a high-powered rifle from one of the
windows

  i dived at once for a dense growth of
high bushes near by and a second shot
followed me as i reached it i fell heav-
ily and screamed pretending that i was
hit i kicked about for a moment until
i had reached a position commanding a
view of the hut and yet remain con-
cealed from view groaned once more
then lay still

  my strategy worked even better than
i had dared hope after a moment of
cautious waiting the evil leering face of
charley ling appeared in the opening

i took careful aim and fired the head
and face disappeared from the opening
but i am such a rotten marksman that
i dared not bestir myself as yet

  i waited a few moments then raised
my hat upon a stick to near the top of
the bushes nothing happened

  at length i got up and crept toward
the hut suddenly i stopped frozen in
my tracks so to speak for there had
come another earth shock

  was charley ling again operating the
projector did he have an accomplice
perhaps he was down unable to arise
and had reached up in his spleen and
again turned on the power to the ultra-
gamma projector

  the earth shocks continued but
strangely they affected me but little i
ran at once to the door of the hut with
my gun in my hand and ready for instant
use

  charley ling lay bleeding upon the
ground floor and he was nowhere near
the ultra-gamma projector it sat upon
a box at the center of the small room

  i was assailed with conflicting emo-
tions for the moment charley ling lay
dying with a bullet hole in his neck
the earth shocks outside continued with
the ultra-gamma machine switched off
for none of its tubes were lighted and i
was forced to the conclusion that the
disturbance in yokohama had been an
ordinary earthquake after all but why
had he shot farley

charley ling stirred and
looked weakly up at me

  you got me damn you he hissed
but if you had been a little bit later-
if you had only been a little bit later

  what have you been doing i asked
bewildered

  been testing out the ultra-gamma
projector charley ling laughed a hard
derisive laugh i was hidden in the
closet of farleys home the day he ex-
plained the damned thing to you al-
most caught me i have just finished
with yokohama and was almost ready
to start for tokio

  charley ling did not know that he
had also well nigh destroyed tokio
well as for that neither did i then

  why do we continue to have shocks
if this contrivance has caused the quake

i asked

  i have loosened up something in the
underlying rock structures that may slip
slide and shake for a week or more i
hope it continues for a month i vowed
when i was but a lad that id some day
get even with the japs for the murder
of my father and i have tried to do
the ultra-gamma wave



it but bell i hoped this thing would
prove to be destructive its too tame
but i hope ive been able to do a little
bit of damage

  think of it the ultra-gamma pro-
jector wasnt destructive enough to suit
charley ling

  when after a few moments charley
ling fell back and lay still i turned my
attention to the instrument which had
wrought such havoc it looked for all
the world like a rather crude radio re-
ceiving set radio had not been per-
fected to its present degree of excellence
at that time and the few sets i had
seen looked something like this instru-
ment

  it was quite compact not much larger
than a portable talking machine had six
large vacuum tubes all exposed to view
across the top but in lieu of a horn
there was a network of small glass tubing
fused together and interwoven very much
after the fashion of a tennis rackct and
only slightly larger this instrument was
connccted by means of two small wires to
the ground and to an automobile bat-
tery which sat upon the floor

  i had to bury farley myself and in
an improvised coffin at that and true
to charley lings prediction the earth
shocks continued for many days

  three weeks later i landed in san
francisco the ultra-gamma projector
went with me it was upon this voyage
back home that i fought the terrific
battle with myself and was wracked and
torn by a rough sea of conflicting emo-
tions desire and scruples

  next day after my arrival upon
american soil i destroyed the ultra-
gamnia projector i do not know the
secret of the construction of the hate-
ful thing i would not know the first
step in the construction of another like
it thank heaven for that

  why did i use dynamite to destroy
so small an instrument ah i knew
youd ask i could easily have destroyed
it with my two hands or i could have
buried it but had i dismantled it i
might have learned the secret of its con-
struction and would most surely have
built another-had i buried it i knew
full well that the temptation to go dig
it up would be well nigh irresistible

  in a few weeks i had recovered from
the shock of my most harrowing experi-
ences my broken ribs had healed and
but for a rather well-marked premature
grayness i was myself again then it
was that i sought and found lucile far-
ley-but that is another story and too
her name isnt farley now its dexter

conclusion

a very ingenious idea which has been brought out to the effect that there
is a satellite behind the moon and therefore unseen by us is ingeniously
developed except for the libration of the moon mankind never sees but
the one face amounting to but a little more than iso degrees of its equatorial
circumference and in this concluding portion the story is brought to a very

striking ending

feeling that things had
reached the stage where a peace-
loving man like myself could slip
away and seek the oblivion that
was his due i began to make
tentative suggestions about my return to
the south seas i made them first to
my own colleagues later to bo-kar and
his fellow martians and finally as a last
resort to that compact council the inter-
national conference had finally appointed
to supervise the worlds defensive opera-
tions

  even though spain backed me marian
and arabella received my suggestions
with a marked coldness the martians
were frankly surprised and such mem-
bers of the international commission as
i approached seemed to guess my thoughts
in advance and side-tracked me before
i could manage to explain just what it
was i wanted

  in the end much to my bewilderment
i found myself probably because of the

knowledge i had acquired on the voyage
in command of a mixed crew of earth-
men and martians and given the job of
visiting most of the european capitals
in turn the trip was made partly to
finish the training of the earth members
of the crew and partly for purpose of
propaganda to that end we carried
copies of the picture records and project-
ing machines after the martian model
so that people could see for themselves
that we were faced by no empty threat

  all sorts of preparations were being
pushed forward at top speed america
from hudson bay to cape horn was a
hive of industry and in england and
germany men were working day and
night the latin nations not yet fully
convinced of the danger made no move as
far as their respective governments were
concerned though offers of help which
were gladly accepted came from indivi-
dual scientists from russia there came
no sign and the recently-formed loose-
knit eastern asiatic confederation was
too fully occupied with its own internal
troubles to worry about anything else

we had again and again to drum it into

amazing stories

people that there was a radical difference
in appearance between our space-ships and
those of the enemy that the adosian
craft were spherical and silver while ours
were cigar-shaped and glowing gold in
color we were very particular about
this since it was vital that the alarm
should be given at the earliest possible
moment once an adosian was sighted
while on the other hand we had no wish
that the population should be thrown into
a state of panic by the mere sight of one
of the martians and as so often hap-
pens all our work in this direction went
for nothing and the one thing we had
never anticipated was the thing that oc-
curred

  bo-kar and his engineers had managed
to erect as the first of a chain a televiso-
phone station outside new york that de-
veloped an extraordinary power and after
one or two abortive attempts they man-
aged to cffect two-way communication
with mars we learnt that another large
fleet had left han a few weeks after us
and that all being well it should be mak-
ing its appearance on earth in between
a fortnight and three weeks bo-kar
in turn gave the council an account of
the situation here and no doubt glad-
dened their hearts with the information
that no opposition had been offered to the
concessions on the moon

  presently the incoming fleet was picked
up thirty million miles out in the void
experiences exchanged the newcomers
warned of the condition of things on
ados and advised to steer clear of that
unhealthy planetoid and make all haste
for earth

  meanwhile the scientists of two planets
were working in a big laboratory they
had taken over close to niagara in the
rather hopeless task of attempting to dis-
cover the nature of the green haze on
ados and its relation to those vibrations
that had so seriously affected all magnetic
recording instruments a section of as-

tronomers was also busy purely from an
academic point of view checking up the
reasons why they had not deduced the
existence of ados before now

something approaching a feasible
explanation of this came to light
when bo-kar one day casually produced
a rough map the martians had made of
the remote side of the moon for long
a certain school of astronomers has held
that the moon is more pear-shaped than
round with the larger and heavier por-
tion turned towards the earth and the
stalk of the pear if one can call it that
facing out into empty space but bo-
kars map showed that both the pear-
and the spherical school were wrong the
remoter side of our satellite was more or
less hollow as though once that hemi-
sphere had contained a vast sea which had
dried up in the course of the ages from
certain calculations we were able to make
the suggestion arose that the mass of
ados taking into account its distance
from the moon almost completely count-
erbalanced the loss due to this concavity-
on the moon whether those calcula-
tions were right or not i cannot say i
merely record the facts as they were given
to me at least they supply to a layman
like myself a feasible solution of the
problem

  the building of the earth space-fleet
was well advanced and still no sign had
come from ados it seemed as though
they had been satisfied by that series of
raids made now many months before and
had drawn off probably to perfect ar-
rangements before launching a final des-
perate attack on earth of course we
had no means of knowing whether or
not we had been visited in the interval
by any spheres which had come purely
on a scouting expedition and managed to
keep their presence hidden from our ob-
servers such a thing was not likely
nevertheless we had to admit that it was
terror out of space



a possibility and far from being a
pleasant one

  one evening a call from han came over
the televisophone to bo-kar a jubilant
message from his home planet to say that
the secret of the green haze had at last
been run to ground by the martian ex-
perimenters and a means of nullifying it
discovered a full report would be ready
inside of twenty-four of our hours and
arrangements were made between the two
parties for recording instruments as well
as for human observers to be ready the
next night at the new york end to re-
ceive the detailed information that would
probably go a long way towards bring-
ing about the final defeat of the adosians

  i was in london myself at the time
helping to put the finishing touches to
some work on the english side and so
i was not an eye-witness of what hap-
pened but i had the full tale later from
spain and bo-kar both of whom were
on the spot

  practically to the tick the two stations
got into communication a slow enough
business when you remember that it took
anything from five to six minutes for
a message to pass from its source to its
destination after some preliminary con-
versation the ilan station gave the signal
that the transmission of the report in full
detail was to start immediately all the
recording instruments were set ready and
the aural and visual observers took their
places there must be no possibility of
a mistake now and machines and human
beings would act as a check on each other

the formal beginning of the report
came through perfectly but the in-
stant it reached the vital stage across the
current of sound from mars there cut a
pulsing rhythmic note faintly musical
yet strong enough to drown completely

   mr harper is assuming that mars was at this
period sixty million miles from earth d that the
waves from the transmitting station were traveling
across space at the speed of light ie s miles
per second

everything that was being transmitted it
was the first time that many of the mar-
tians had heard this note and they were
inclined at first to put it down to some
species of atmospheric or cosmic inter-
ference

  spain on the other hand would have
that it was nothing of the kind he was
quite positive he declared that it was
the same species of transmission we had
heard the night before our departure for
mars and he recalled what bo-kar had
seemingly forgotten for the moment
those warning signals we in the tellus
had received and recorded on our way
back to earth the records of these were
at the moment somewhere in the tele-
visophonic station and as the recording
machines were already at work the two
specimens could be compared later but
even in the absence of this comparison
spain had absolutely no doubt that the
present interference originated from
ados his manner more than anything
else decided bo-kar though probably the
martian was more than half-convinced
already that this was a deliberate at-
tempt at interference expressly designed
to prevent us getting hold of vital in-
formation if that was so it indicated
that the adosians were possessed of a
higher degree of intelligence and a greater
grasp of the problem confronting us than
we had so far credited to them

  but to whatever the interference should
ultimately prove to be due the fact re-
mained that all attempts to get the neces-
sary information from mars were un-
successful over a period of a week the
new york station was in almost constant
communication with ilan many messages
passed to and fro between the two sta-
tions but the moment any reference was
made to the green haze or any other mat-
ters relative to ados the beams were
jammed

  in desperation it was decided to code
all messages far from having the de-


amazing stories

sired effect the experiment merely resulted
in all communication between die two
planets being completely ait off all
this in itself was bad enough but worse
still it gave rise to the further disquiet-
ing suggestion that the adosians had in
some fashion achieved a command of
rocan sufficient at any rate to guess the
purport of all our messages it was an
idea that led us at first to credit the
adosians with powers they did not
possess a feasible solution was offered
however when someone recollected the
martian ship that had been lost in the
battle in the void our presumption-
so strong as to be almost a certainty-
had been that the vessel after breaking in
two had crashed on the planetoid and her
crew had been killed the moment the air
escaped from die stricken vessel now
unless we were to believe that the ados-
ians possessed the miraculous power of
translating offhand a language utterly
alien to them there seemed a strong pos-
sibility that some at least of the crew of
the stricken ship had escaped with their
lives

  additional force was lent to this idea
when we discovered that it was only when
the conversation turned towards ados and
matters relative to that planet that mes-
sages in rocan were interrupted on
the other hand messages in code or in
english were jammed right at the start
obviously then the adosians were taking
no chances of anything getting over in a
tongue they did not understand

  the net result of all this was that in
one way we were hampered in our efforts
on the other hand if anything was needed
to spur us on we found it in the prob-
ability that some of our martian allies
were captives in the hands of the ados-
ians

  there was another result one entirely
unforeseen by us

  the attack on the televisophonoc sta-
tion outside new york came literally

without warning the spheres dropping
down on it out of a clear sky inside
ten seconds the station and its surround-
ings were completely destroyed and where
it had been was left a devastated wilder-
ness covered a foot deep in a lava-like
substance that took long to cool fortu-
nately the attack had been made during
the day and at a time when there were
comparatively few people about

  with the realization that no satisfactory
communication between die two planets
could be kept up owing to the adosian
interference the place had actually been
temporarily abandoned only a skeleton
staff and an emergency operator being
retained bo-icar and his staff were in-
stalled in quarters in washington where
they were conducting certain experiments
whose result will be noted later sad as
it was to think that the skeleton staff had
literally been blasted into nothingness to
one who took the wider view of the needs
of the hour there was consolation in the
fact that men whom the two planets
could ill spare had escaped death and
destruction

curiously enough the adosian
fleet seemed content with the wreck-
ing of the station for that completed they
disappeared again into the void in one
way this heartened us it showed that
their preparations were by no means yet
completed they evidently needed more
time before launching the fdl strength of
their armada though in the interval they
would take every possible step to prevent
us acquiring information likely to lead to
their defeat it was a very natural con-
clusion that if we could manage to get
the result of the ilanian scientists inves-
tigation of the green haze we would have
in our hands a weapon that would remove
the adosian menace forever

  my recall came while i was in london
my space-ship as well as all the others
scattered round the world was ordered
terror out of space



to rendezvous at once my own destina-
tion was given as the space-flier park in
british columbia all up and down the
globe wherever the necessary materials
and equipment existed space-ships on the
martian model were being built but as
soon as they were ready for launching
save for an odd ship retained here and
there purely as a precautionary measure
they were concentrated in one or the other
of the half-dozen parks concealed in the
heavily wooded districts of the western
united states and canada it was an ar-
rangement that had been made with the
full consent of the participating powers
for it was felt that only in such fortunate
districts could the task of camouflaging
the giant craft be undertaken with any
degree of success elsewhere they would
be readily visible and vulnerable to any
sudden attack launched by a scouting
party of adosians

  i found bo-kar and some of the mem-
bers of the international commission
awaiting me and in a few words they
outlined the situation to me

  to begin with two ships were to be
sent out with a two-fold object firstly
they were to intercept the incoming
martian fleet and warn them of the latest
developments and secondly it was felt
that a space-ship equipped with televiso-
phonic apparatus could if it got suffi-
ciently far out in the void make con-
nection with ilan and get the vital infor-
mation before the adosians discovered
what was afoot two ships traveling
separately would stand a better chance
of success than one but as an additional
precaution they would both be painted a
dead non-refleling black that would make
them virtually invisible against the back-
ground of the void unless one of them
should happen to occult a star at the mo-
ment an adosian observer had his instru-
ment trained on it the chance of this
happening however was only about one in
a hundred thousand in the case of two

ships the odds against them both being
discovered in this fashion were consider-
ably greater

hphe first ship said bo-kar has
already been selected it is our
own roca and it will start off at mid-
night to-night with a volunteer crew of
martians and some earth-men super-
numeraries who have begged to go
gonar will command

  and the second ship someone asked
i am coming to that bo-kar replied
mars must not have all the honor
this one shall be an earth ship tellus
the first built here to be commissioned
and her crew and commander must be
earth-men save that for safetys sake a
few experienced men of my own people
will accompany them

  he paused i guessed what was com-
ing the call for volunteers but it never
came instead

  retallick stepped forward quickly i
ask for the post of commander he said

  slowly bo-kar shook his head and i
saw the eagerness die out of retailicks
eyes and the pain and hurt creep in

  youre wanted here maddn said
taking the words out of bo-kars mouth
if anything happened to  to your
esteemed father-in-law youd have to step
into his shoes you and your wife no
you cant go can he bo-kar

  before the martian could answer retal-
lick spoke again thats quite all right
he said holding himself in with an effort
i see your point of view and i wont
say youre wrong up to a point that
is but where youre making your big
mistake is in this these two ships arc
going on a mission where they cant
afford to fail one or the other must get
through and they should be given equal
chances right from start now mind
im not saying a word against our earth-
trained men theyre good better than
that in fact but theyve had no training


amazing stories

in the void they dont know mars and
the earth and spacc in between as i do
that may sound like bragging but its
the strict truth

  he ended on a breathless note and
stood his eyes scanning the faces of the
commission awaiting their decision hop-
ing he had swayed it in his favor

  cardigan an english member of the
commission said something i gathered
he was opposing retallicks suggestion
but i cannot say what exactly he said
you see someone was whispering in my
ear marian her hand on my arm and
her lips dose to my facc

  one moment gentlemen i cut
across the thread of discussion and all
eyes turned to me mr retallick isnt
whatever he might think the only earth-
man who has had experience of earth and
mars and the space between there arc
others myself for example therefore
i volunteer for the post of commander

  for the moment there was a subdued
murmur of voices the members of the
commission talking one to the other and
i saw eyes turn from me to marian and
back to marian again she sensed the in-
decision the feeling that this was a single
mans job not the sort of trip on which
to send a married man leaving his wife
behind perhaps to mourn his loss and
sensing it she took the only way out

  i think said marian in her clear
voice that instantly silenced the buzz of
discussion that my husband failed to
make it plain that he has volunteered on
the sole condition that i accompany him
in whatever capacity you see fit bo-kar
can tell you that i have passed my space-
training tests in the void and that i
measured up to the standard of compe-
tence he set further come what may
we wish to face the best or the worst
together should we fail we die with
the knowledge that the fault is none of
ours happy to the end in each others
company content at the last to pass from

life together after doing all in our power

  we could have heard a pin drop from
the tensity of the silence i knew they had
been impressed had they been demon-
strative men  think they would have
cheered as it was half-a-dozen heads
bent close together whispers passed then
bo-kar turned abruptly to me

  we agree to your condition mr har-
per he said the start is timed for
midnight take over control before that
hour the sooner the better

the big hand of the earth-set chro-
nometer crept slowly round to the ap-
pointed hour outside the landing field
was in darkness though dim figures
moved hurriedly backwards and forwards
between the two ships and the camou-
flaged hangars the ships themselves
painted a dead non-reflecting black were
practically invisible an observer a few
hundred feet above us would not have
noticed them

  despite the fact that our last minute
preparations were all carried on in the
dark-we deemed it wiser not to show
a light of any sort these days no one
could say what prowling spheres might
be about-everything went with a swing
and a celerity that spoke well for the or-
ganization behind it

  eleven thirty half an hour to go
time for visitors to make their departure

  the commission gave me final instruc-
tions shook hands solemnly one by one
turned and marched out bo-kar noma
and retallick lingered a moment after
the big martian took my hand in the
two of his held it a second and-word-
less-gazed into my eyes had he spoken
with the tongue of eloquence he could
have said no more than that glance con-
veyed and somehow i felt the better man
for the knowledge that this man from an
alien world trusted me so

  the double handclasp broken he
turned to marian
terror out of space



  good hunting--and a quick meeting
again harper said retallick then al-
most in a whisper you lucky beggar

  noma i think meant to follow his ex-
ample and shake hands but at the last
moment overcome by a sudden impulse
she changed her mind and bending
swiftly kissed me full on the lips

  it is the custom she said and left
me wondering just what exactly she
meant

  they went i waited until they had
gone until the word came from the
guards that the last of the visitors had
left the ship then i gave the signal to
close and seal the entrance ports the
hollow clang they made on contact echo-
ing throughout the ship roused grim
forebodings in me as though someone
had sealed the entrance to our tomb

  slowly the hand crept round three
then two minutes to midnight

  a touch of a key on the bank in front
of me and the great gong sounded con-
trol quarters gradually the gravity
screens shifted into place the control
light showing all clear glowed above
the key-bank another instant and i had
thrown the switch that sent the magne-
tized current flowing through the gravity
screens and that raised us gently from
our landing slips

  portions of the outer shell enough to
enable us to see about us and below us
had not been shifted into place as yet
would not indeed be moved until we were
nearing the limits of the atmosphere
that much was vouchsafed us a last
glimpse at the land we were leaving

  slowly we rose slowly the earth dwin-
dled away beneath us the earth on which
we might never again tread   

     footsteps sounded outside the
door opened two figures advanced over
the threshold of the control-room

  i turned and stared at them a man
and a woman spain and arabella
neither of whom had any right here both

of whom should have been a thousand
miles or more away down on the pacific
coast attending there to duties the com-
mission had assigned them

hat are you doing here i said
sharply weve no room for pas-
sengers id land you both if it wasnt
too late but we cant go back now and
upset our schedule

  they came farther into the room ara-
bella closed the door carefully behind
them

  we came in to-night after youd gone
aboard spain said slowly the general
recall order brought us here we heard
what was afoot that volunteers had al-
ready been picked otherwise of course
we would have been in the first batch
but we got in in time to mingle with
the visitors as they were leaving i caught
bo-kar just before he left the ship i
asked him could i go

  and he said no i took him up
sharply

  spain shook his head he said the
full complement had already been chosen
but the right rested with you to take an-
other one or two if you wished he
also intimated that it was impossible to
get in touch with you now as all visitors
were leaving the ship i took that as a
hint so i said point-blank do you for-
bid us to go sir

   the power to forbid or permit has
passed from my hands he said and turn-
ing left me so we came here
diplomatic of bo-kar i must say i
remarked throwing the onus on me
i suppose if i did the right thing id
send you both into the airlock and shoot
you out into space you see were carry-
ing neither passengers nor freight this
trip and i cant think of any other head-
ing you can come under as it is i sup-
pose ill have to put up with your com-
pany for the duration of the trip but
why the deuce did the two of you do it


amazing stories

the guards shouldnt have let you pass
seeing us talking to bo-kar they
probably took it for granted that we were
late-coming members of the crew spain
retorted then why did we do it
billy i dont know unless it is that
weve been through so many queer
scrapes together that we thought wed like
to be in at the death

  quite a good excuse if it came to that
but then a more tactful man would have
used a less suggestive word

chapter xxv

the race

yet once i was able to consider
the situation calmly i had to own
i was not altogether displeased to
have spain and arabella on board with
us the arrangement had its advantages
the others though known to me by sight
and name had not gone through strife
and stress with me i had had no op-
portunity of forming an opinion of their
abilities in a crisis while on the other
hand i knew of old how reliable the
spains could be true this new warfare
was a novelty to them more so than it
was to me but they had done their train-
ing and passed with honors that
labelled them as fit to act as my subor-
dinates and within limits to exercise their
own initiative

  still for disciplines sake i told them
what i should have thought of them
pointed out the difference two extra
mouths to feed might make on a long
space trip and that done thanked the
god that made us that they had had
enough enterprise to stow away

  the first few days passed without inci-
dent what was happening on mars or
earth we could not say we dare not
open communication with either planet as
things were but once away past ados and
out in the void we might be able to get

in touch with i lan as long however as
the planetoid was between us and the red
panet there was always the chance of
the adosians cutting in on our signals and
either jamming them or picking up in-
formation we did not want them to get

  there came a day when  could look
back and see earth and its two satellites
drifting into the void behind and to one
side of us communication with our
home planet was more than ever out of
the question but i began to debate with
myself the advisability of calling mars
for some reason i could not define at the
time i decided to defer any such attempt
for twenty-four hours it was just as
well that i did

  improvements had been made in the
two ships in the time they had been on
earth the one change i liked best
and that gave me the greatest feeling
of safety was a repelling ray derice
our greatest danger on previous trips
so far had been from wandering meteor-
ites the possibility of their presence
entailed constant watchfulness and an
alertness that strained ones faculties to
the utmost true our early magnetic
devices picked the meteorites up while
yet a considerable distance from us
still because of the sudden changes of
direction necessary to avoid them we
dared not accelerate to peak

  while we were on earth a number of
experiments had been made and finally
a good deal of scientific team-work had
resulted in producing a piece of appa-
ratus that exercised a repelling influence
on any body near enough to affect
our warning magnetic devices as soon
as a meteorite came close enough to set
the sensitive machine in action a warn-
ing gong rang and a species of switch
operated to throw the repelling ray in
the right direction and sheer the me-
teorite away off its course

  actually it was to this instrument that
we owed our salvation
terror out of space



  the note of the gong reverberating
through the ship roused all of us who
were not on duty not one single note
but a succession as though the ringing
would never stop i could only think
that we had run into a meteoric cluster
and the repeller ray under its influence
was trying to drive every way at once
fearful it would become overloaded and
blow out i raced to the control-room
where spain and the second officer were
sharing responsibility between them

  i flung the control-room door open

  whats wrong i demanded a
meteoric cluster

  meteoric cluster be jiggered said
spain politely have a look in the
view-finder thing yourself

  he turned as he spoke wiping the
beaded sweat from his forehead with a
heavy hand i stole a glance at the
second officer a martian and i fancied
he looked a shade paler i had not time
to note more than that i bent over
the vision-plate

  the instant i did so i realized the
cause of their agitation no meteorites
these but looking small and remote in
the void a flight of the detestable
spheres strung out across space like a
row of silvered golf-balls the sun glint-
ing fiercely on them i whistled softly
no wonder the gong had kept ringing
defying all efforts to stop it it took a
moment for the full implication of what
i saw to dawn upon me yet when it
came it came with a blinding over-
whelming force

  the spheres must be dead ahead of
us right in our course else they would
not have affected the warning apparatus
so strongly and so constantly

  i glanced from one to the other of
the pair and in the eyes of earth-man
and martian i saw the same thought
mirrored

  ive rung down said spain in a
tone of forced calmness and were

slewing round i darent use the rocket
tubes though theyd see the gas es-
caping

  id thought of that too id also
thought of something else

  theyve probably got something of
the sort too i said nodding toward
our repeller ray instruments if they
have theyve located us already re-
mains to be seen though whether
theyve discovered were a space-ship or
not lets hope they think were a
meteorite of sorts

  the martian shook his head were
against the sun he said if they see
our silhouette    our one hope to
date is that weve been traveling so fast
they couldnt make our shape out
forgetful of discipline peering again
into the vision-plate he clutched my arm
muttered 

  i shook him off what is it man
i cried shouldering him aside the better
to see for mvself

  the rocd he gasped weve for-
gotten her shes ahead of us they
   theyll get her

  all too true in the excitement we
had overlooked the fact that our sister
ship was well ahead of us invisible
to us we had not troubled about her
to date but now as we watched we
saw a cigar-shaped silhouette against
the gleaming line of spheres her black-
painted hull reflected no rays of the sun
in itself but as it swerved to avoid the
spheres it momentarily blotted them from
view and in perspective its shadow-shape
was flung on them as a background

  a flash of light in the vision-plate a
gleam of brilliant green and the spheres
were on her like a pack of ravening
wolves by some uncanny means of
their own the adosians may have
guessed the line we would take and
waited for us or perhaps the encounter
was after all no more than accident
no one could say the reason of it
amazing stories

 

mattered little the motive was all that
counted

  i dont think ive ever thought quicker
in my life my instincts were to go to
our consorts rescue my instructions
ran dead against doing any such thing
no matter what happened to the other
one ship had to get through the roca
i judged was already doomed the
longer i balanced in indecision the more
likely we were to share her fate she
must look after herself we held the
future of two planets in our hands
yet i knew some of her crew mar-
tians and earth-nien gallant fellows
all

  i turned from the vision-plate full
lift at an angle of forty-five degrees
and the topmost pitch of acceleration
i ordered

  i scarcely knew my own voice it
had grown hard naturally i had to
steel myself to give the order

  spain gave me one look then one
after another pressed the keys on the
bank the tellus responded instantly
rising so steeply that wc were almost
thrown off our feet the spheres seemed
to be slipping down at an angle an
immense distance beneath us the void
aflame with the hells light of their rays
the tellus into them glowing white-hot
horribly visible now

  then came the roar of our rocket
tubes thunder on thunder and under
the kick of the reaction we sped like a
black bullet across the star-spangled
blackness of space it did not matter
now whether or not the adosians could
locate us by means of their instruments
of detection the gray-green stream of
the rocket gas drifting comet-like away
behind us was ample advertisement of
our presence

  it had the effect i expected the one
that in a way i dreaded half of the
spheres desisted from their destruction
of the roca snapped off their rays

rotated and came on hurrying after us

  i watched the dial-hand of the speed
gauge anxiously flashing every now and
then a glance back at the vision-plate
we were taking all the acceleration we
could stand in a little the rocket tubes
must stop discharging lest we shake our-
selves to picces it remained to be seen
what speed the spheres could reach we
were too far away for their rays to
touch us yet but if we could not show
them a clean pair of heels a few hours
would see us looking our last upon the
round of space

  for a time the spheres seemed to be
gaining on us and our hearts stood still
the more so now as the thundering of
the rocket tubes had died away we
had reached our peak of acceleration in
this frictionless void we could hold our
speed forever if necessary but we had
yet to learn whether the spheres could
reach a higher pitch

  i looked away too much staring at
the vision-plate leads one to imagine
sights that are not there five long
minutes dragged wearily by before i
would permit myself another glance
i might have been mistaken but we
seemed to be holding them the others
in the room were doubtful they thought
that if we were not maintaining our dis-
tance any gain the sphere had made
was so small as to be almost imper-
ceptible

  a little later i looked a third time
and-did i imagine it-the spheres
seemed if anything a trifle smaller i
said nothing did not evei ask the others
this time to check my vision optical
illusions tired eyes kindred - ases
jumped into my mind also  new
too well how strong could be th ower
of suggestion how easy it was to see
the thing one wished-one hoped-to see
time would tell the true position in
an hour we would know for certain
even granted they were overhauling us
terror out of space



it must be hours at our present relative
rates of speed before they could come
near enough to strike meanwhile   
well meanwhile we could only wait and
hope and make our small preparations to
retaliate as lay in our limited power

  twice the warning gong went and
twice our hearts thumped in sheer ner-
vousness but each time it was only a
meteorite one a globe of iron and nickel
two hundred yards across the other a
thing no larger than a mans hand yet
large enough to have sent us to de-
struction if we had met it head on at
the pace we were traveling but our
warning gong and repeller rays were
working perfectly and each meteorite
sheered off passing us safely at a dis-
tance of many miles

  then abruptly without warning the
gong began an intermittent ringing i
sprang to the vision-plate fearing i
knew not what it was still angled
on the spheres behind us but i could
see now that they were only about two-
thirds their former size they were
falling behind we were gaining on them
   slowly

  it could not have been the spheres
then that had actuated the gong and
that still kept it ringing - while i was
shifting the vision-plate round from
one angle to another a bell tinkled twice
the call irom the operating room

  answer that spain i said its
probably marian shes earth operator
on duty

  it was she had something to say
good news of a sort the televisio-
phonic screen had been registering the
last few minutes registering in rocan
she had been afraid to answer doubt-
ing whether the spheres could cut in or
not

  switch over here i told spain
ill answer

   guessed i felt somehow that it could
be only the one thing and in the last

moment before the transmission room
switched across to the control-roora
connection i moved the vision-plate
again giving it a wide-angle range of
ninety degrees with our nose as dead
center

  tiny golden specks they leaped into
the center of the plate the great battle-
fleet of mars streaming out to meet us
the fleet for whose arrival all earth was
anxiously waiting

  i nearly reeled dizzy with the reac-
tion i caught hold of the edge of the
vision-plate to steady myself felt it
move and slip to one side under the
pressure of my fingers and when i
looked i found my involuntary action
had shifted the fleet out of focus

  heavens how they must have worked
on mars to launch that fleet in the time
the speeding-up they must have done
the whole planet bent as a single-minded
unit to the achievement of the one pur-
pose

  faint images flitted across the sur-
face of the televisiophonic screen faint
sounds came from the receiver i tuned
in amplifying until the deep throaty
rocan voice sounded as though in my
ear till it filled the room and every word
could be heard by those around us

  i beckoned to the second officer

  your people i said to you the
honor to hold conversation with them

  he gave me a grateful glance yet my
action was not solely altruistic i wished
to be quite sure what the message was
feared that my knowledge of rocan
might prove inadequate to the strain
a word here and there i caught but
not enough to do more than sense the
drift of the message these martians
talking amongst themselves speak too
fast for the average earth-man to follow
what they are saying

  the man turned from the screen at
length they-he fumbled for the
words-they have discovered the secret


amazing stories

of that green haze   thee    thee
vibratory screen they know how to
counteract it that was the message
they were trying to get through to earth
they are afraid even now to tell us
thee    thee adosians can still in-
terfere in a call but he-the com-
mander who is speaking-says that if
we connect the picture-recording machine
to the screen we can get the message that
way photograph it is not that what
you call it

  a great light dawned on me you
mean i said that he will transmit
to us the image of the written mes-
sages

  thee    thee formula yes said
the martian nodding vigorously

  why hadnt we thought of that be-
fore the one way to overcome the
adosian interference they could lis-
ten in on all our spoken messages and
jam them if and when they thought fit
but unless they had remarkably sensitive
instruments the televisioned formula for
destroying the green haze and all that
it implied could not be intercepted much
less interfered with its reception you
see would occupy no more than an in-
stant of time not a matter of long min-
utes like the spoken word

  but even when wc had the formula
what good would it be to us now a
barrier of spheres stretched between us
and earth we could not dare not run
the gauntlet with so precious a cargo

  fool that i was we could re-transmit
to earth of course but even in that
there was a snag the picture-recording
camera-like machines with their sensitive
plates must be rigged ready to receive
the impression the various earth sta-
tions should be warned in advance yet
i could not see how i could do so any
message that could not be transmitted
instantaneously would almost certainly
be jammed i did think of transmitting
the picture record on the off-chance of

one of the stations at least receiving it
and making assurance doubly sure by
transmitting again at regular intervals
but i decided that would be taking too
great a risk the first transmission
might not be recorded-i was practically
certain that it would not be-and the
following ones were bound to be inter-
fered with it was too big a problem
for me to work out unaided

  the martian turned from the screen
it is finished sir he said thee pic-
ture has come through

 good rush it to the developing
room i want a dozen prints s quickly
as possible

  he sailed and was turning to go with
the box camera-like affair tucked under
his arm when i called to him by
the way i said as you go send the
chief rocan operator here to me

  he went a little later the martian
operator came and i put my problem
to him he shook his head he knew
of no way of overcoming the difficulty
the chances in his estimation were
that even a single instantaneous trans-
mission would not get through where-
as i had visualized the adosian inter-
ference as a sort of directional beam cut-
ting knife-likc across our lines of com-
munication he pictured it more as a
series of concentric rings a kind of eddy
of force palpitating out in all directions
from the point of origin most probably
he was right in which case there was
only one thing left us to do

  our acceleration had carried us well
past the martian fleet and now we were
slewing around in a wide circle to join
up with them i called the martian
commander on the televisiophone and
got through apparently the adosian
field of interference did not extend so
far into space nevertheless i felt afraid
that the retreating spheres might be able
to intercept our signals if in rocan so
is there anyone on board who can
terror out of space



speak english i asked of the face in
the vision plate the commander him-
self for it was to him i was speaking
intimated that he did probably he had
learnt it when we were on mars either
through the records or from thrang
himself which did not matter

  however secure in the knowledge that
our english conversation would be un-
intelligible to the adosians i told him
briefly as simply and as plainly as i
could what i intended doing and asked
his co-operation i got it without a
seconds hesitation

  briefly the situation was this the
constant researches of the martian sci-
entists had evolved a formula showing
the nature of adoss protecting haze
and that also showed how to nullify
it the martian fleet en route to earth
had received this formula by televisio-
phone but a few days before unfor-
tunately they were helpless in the sense
that they lacked the materials necessary
to construct the apparatus that would de-
molish the haze such things were not
normally among the stores carried on
space-ships but given the materials
and such a work-shop as could be found
on earth or mars the required instru-
ments could be constructed in a few
hours if i could get the formula into
the hands of my colleagues enough
equipment for all our space-ships in
commission could be ready by the time
the fleet we had just met readied earth

  our plans made the martian and i
disconnected i used the interval of
waiting in acquainting all on board with
the situation sooner almost than i had
expected the vision-plate showed me the
martian fleet beginning to move off sud-
denly from out of their midst one gleam-
ing golden ship shot forward the gray
green streams of gas from the rocket
exhausts marking its passage across the
void it was headed earthwards

  i allowed the tellus to fall behind the

fleet and not until the ships were a
long way ahead did i dare start our
rocket engines but then i managed to
make acceleration under the cover of
gas streams from the other ships by
the time t had nearly drawn level with
them i was able to cut out the engines
and with the impetus already received
forge steadily ahead the tellus in-
visible now lifted in a long slant passed
over the massed ships and headed out
earthwards

  meanwhile the single ship which had
sped on ahead had attracted the atten-
tion of the spheres they had halted
in their headlong retreat to ados and
i could almost imagine them debating
the situation despite their superior
numbers they were seemingly not anx-
ious to engage the entire fleet perhaps
they fancied the martian ships might be
equipped with unpleasant surprises in
the way of novel or untried weapons
or more probably like the martian com-
mander himself they had orders not to
precipitate a general conflict

  but the intentions of this lone ship
were seemingly obvious it was streak-
ing for earth carrying information that
must not be allowed to get there with
a speed so quick that it almost dazzled
the eyes the adosians altered their for-
mation half a dozen ships detached
themselves from the bunch set off in
pursuit of the earthward-bound martian
while others wheeled about and strung
across in the path of the oncoming fleet
the green rays in their invisible infra-
red carrier beams licking out suggest-
ively the martian line slowed halted
wavered - and slowly reluctantly it
seemed slewed round on their course
the way was barred the odds against
them were too powerful to contend with
that at least must have been the ado-
sians reading of their actions

  the lone martian ship despite its
start showed signs of flagging it looked


amazing stories

as though the pursuers would speedily
run it down it too paused uncertainly
in its flight zig-zagging to escape the
clutching fingers of the beams then
doubling like a hunted hare came round
in a wide circle that would bring it back
to its parent fleet far out beyond the
outermost fringe of the wide-flung ado-
sian fleet the pursuing spheres whipped
round as though to cut it off but the
curve it cut was too large for them to
hope to run it down before it reached
the rest of the fleet the spheres flagged
in the race and one by one they began
to drift back to the main line drawn like
a barrier between earth and the mar-
tian dctachraent but they must have
felt satisfied that they had managed to
preveul any message reaching earth

  but so beautifully had it all been
timed at the very moment that the
hunted martian wheeled out on the long
curve to rejoin the fleet drawing the
adosians after her the tellus invisible
in her black paint was speeding swiftly
far up over the spot where pursuer and
pin-sued had been but a moment before
heading out for earth and safety strat-
egy had succeeded where force was of
no avail the maneuver had achieved
its purpose of drawing off possible pur-
suit during the vital few minutes neces-
sary for us to get a flying start

  i had no hope that it would last
however even now the adosians must
be discovering that the agitation of their
detecting instruments was due to some-
thing other than the maneuvers of the
dodging martian in a little while
though they could not sec us they would
get our direction

  they did sooner than i expected
looking back i saw a movement in the
line of spheres saw some detach them-
selves from the main body and come
streaking in a dead straight line for us
they had got our direction of flight then
speed was the one thing that could save

us and since concealment was no longer
necessary i rang for full explosions on
the rocket tubes

  the tellus trembled in every rivet as
we hurtled through space yet despite the
tremendous speed we must have been
making we did not seem to be gaining
the spheres were certainly showing a
turn of speed i had not anticipated for
quite six hours they held us even at
times seemed to be gaining a little and
for every second of that time my heart
like that of nearly everyone else on
board was in my mouth i dont think
however that any of them-fortunately
for their peace of mind-visualized the
possibilities i did our repelling rays
would warn us of approaching meteor-
ites and deal with them in the accepted
way but i dreaded to think of what
would happen if another line of spheres
suddenly showed up ahead of us it
would be impossible at the rate we were
going to avoid them and a head-on col-
lision would see us all blown into in-
candescent dust

  sir-a voice at my elbow brought
me up all standing-thee prints are
ready

  it was that wonderfully efficient mar-
tian officer back from the developing-
room with a dozen dry prints in his
hands he had even - heaven be
praised-with a thorough understanding
of what i had in my mind had them
reduced to microscopic smallness and
i had forgotten all about them but the
sight of them brought an old idea back
to my mind and i decidcd it was worth
trying now

  spain i said take control and
keep her on her course as she is now
i think were holding the spheres-at
any rate theyre not gaining on us

  what are yon going to do  he asked
curiously

  im going to the transmitting room
in the hope of putting a print over to
terror out of space



earth that operators theory may have
been wrong i dont think there can be
a continuous interruption anyway im
taking a chance that as were a swiftly
moving body shortening the distance be-
tween earth and ourselves with every
second we may be able to get through

  the operator was plainly dubious about
my chances but since we were now
heading earthwards at velocity peak he
agreed with me that it was worth taking
the risk something might come of it
at any rate we would have the satisfac-
tion of knowing we had done our best

  i set the print against the grid of the
vision-plate and sent out the earth call
though the new york station had been
destroyed there were now others in ex-
istence in various parts of the earth
and surely one of them would catch my
signal in three-quarters of a minute
from the time i called a light would
glow and a bell ring in every televisio-
phonic station on the side of the planet
facing us but the question worrying me
was would they understand would they
realize the moment they saw the tiny
print glowing in their own vision-plates
that it must be photographed before the
image faded i must take my chances
on that

  watch in hand and with beating heart
 waited a full minute after i had sent
out the attention call then on the very
tick i pressed the button that made the
television connection and released it in-
stantly the light in the vision-plate
appeared and died in a single flash
thirty seconds later i pressed the but-
ton again and held it down while the
second hand of my watch ticked half-
way round the dial then released pres-
sure for good or for ill the picture
traveling on the wings of light had gone
shooting off to earth whether it would
ever reach there was another matter


  we held the spheres we did more

as that period of twenty-four hours
drew to an end wc found them dwin-
dling a little at first then more and
more perceptibly as time wore on it
may have been no more than imagination
-though if so it was a delusion com-
mon to us all-but the spheres seemed to
be altering their course to be sheering
off at right angles as though they were
making for ados in a way we hoped
that this was so at the same time the
maneuver could only mean that the
planetoids authorities were deciding on
some big coup that might bring all our
plans to naught but i banished the
idea from my mind for it does not do
to think of such things and as soon as
i could i sought the rest i had so long
desired

  nearly twelve hours later i was awak-
ened from a sound sleep by marians
voice in my ear and her hand on my
arm

  i thought id better tell you at once
dear she said weve received a tele-
vision picture from earth its been
photographed developed and enlarged
and here it is

  she handed me the finished print
i sat up and read it through following
our example the earth station had writ-
ten out their message and transmitted it
as i had done mine

  ours had got through the picture
had been recorded in the nick of time
just as it was fading and the formula
was now in the hands of the planet
authorities the work was being rushed
through and all spacc-ships that could
be commissioned would be sent off at
the end of twenty-four hours they
would carry sufficient of the new equip-
ment to supply a hundred space ships
not counting that for their own use our
instructions were to rendezvous with
them in the void receive our quota and
place ourselves under the orders of the
fleet-commander

  i looked at marian and our eyes met

  inside a week my dear i said husk-
ily the adosian menace will be ended
forever or there wont be one of us
left alive to worry about it

chapter xxvi

victory

two days later we managed to
make contact with the fleet from
earth and within another twenty-
four hours we had sighted them obed-
ient to signals we ran the tellus along-
side the flag-ship our connecting tubes
were made fast and sealed against air-
leakage and we ourselves crossed over
we found bo-kar in command and
with him retallick and norna they
had much to tell us but since time was
short they told us as briefly as possible
since we left the ether had been frantic
with signals the earth stations real-
izing that interception and interruption
was a game that two can play had man-
aged to cut in on the adosian com-
munications having no idea of the
language for the plates we had taken
from the original sphere had so far
defied the combined efforts at translation
of the martian and tellurian scientists
they were unable to make head or tail
of them but from the staccato urgency
of their tone our people guessed that
some great movement probably dictated
by a sudden panic was being mooted
moreover a couple of space-ships sent
outside the earths atmospheric envelope
were able with their long-range observa-
tion telescopes unhampered by any in-
tervening atmosphere to make out great
activity in the void close investigation
of the moon showed a constant passing
to and fro of large fleets of spheres and
presently they began to concentrate there
as though preparing for a desperate
stand

  but then suddenly following on a
series of frantic signals cutting across
the void the massed spheres left the
moon and disappeared behind it in the
direction of invisible ados it was re-
ported however that on the heels of
this the green haze which had now
spread like a luminous halo round the
moon had increased in power and in-
tensity

  the international commission was al-
ready considering the advisability of
launching into the void such spacc-ships
as were ready when our message came
through it confirmed them in their
belief that the adosians preparations
were nearing a climax and at the same-
time it gave our folk the one weapon
they needed to even up the odds against
them the great armada already pro-
visioned and equipped was immediately
launched and additional apparatus hur-
riedly constructed and stored on board
it remained now only to make a junc-
tion with the martian fleet and stake
all on a desperate offensive against the
adosians the fact that all attempts
to interfere with free communication
had ceased a little before i had televised
the formula might mean anything or
nothing perhaps the adosians had ad-
vanced so far that they need no longer
hinder us in this respect on the other
hand it was quite as likely that the ces-
sation of interruption had been merely
coincidence a dozen other solutions
each equally plausible jumped to our
minds

  we were given our instructions and
sent back to the tellus a number of
mechanics with the new equipment ac-
companied us and began setting it up
right away

  as we hurtled off to join the oncom-
ing fleet from mars i questioned one of
the men who were to operate the new
machines he waj rather hazy as we
all were as to the exact function of
terror out of space



the green halo surrounding ados but
he was inclined to think that it was
either a power ceiling or a defensive
field of force rays its nature purev
electrical had been fathomed however
and the new equipment was designed
to counteract its effects solely by oppos-
ing it with force rays of greater power

  i had given little or no thought in
the interval to the rest of the mar-
tian fleet i had taken it for granted
that they were following on behind the
tellus though at a much reduced speed
somehow the sight of the spheres which
had pursued us turning off and heading
for ados must have given rise to the
idea in my mind that the main body
was also being recalled i learnt to my
dismay that the reverse was the case
when instructions came through that we
were to make all possible speed in full
battle order

   it appeared that the fleet after assist-
ing me to escape from the ring of
spheres had been suddenly and violently
attacked by the full force of the re-
maining adosians the entire fleet had
narrowly escaped destruction indeed
three ships were incinerated in the void
before a retreat movement could be be-
gun and it was only when realizing
the odds against them and the hopeless-
ness of attempting to engage the sphere
on anything like equal terms they turned
tail and headed for mars that the ado-
sian pursuit showed any signs of slack-
ening even then the chase was not
abandoned true the adosians made
no attempt to overtake the retreating
martians but they hung on their skirts
and herded them towards the red planet
in much the same way wolves will herd
deer to their eventual undoing the
move probably was purely strategic the
adosians wished to conserve their forces
as much as possible for some effort not
yet apparent and at the same time pre-
vent the fleets of earth and mars from

joining so as to overwhelm them

  we came upon the spheres suddenly
though no doubt our observing scouts
had sighted them long before a great
line of silver beads strung across the
firmament and far ahead of them dim
in the infinite distance the glowing shape
of the martian ships looking in that
vastness like tiny goldfish

  we on board die tellus had antici-
pated a certain cautiousness in the ap-
proach but bo-kar and his colleagues
had apparently decided that the impetu-
ous method was the best

  the spheres must have become aware
of us about the time we first sighted
them and we were soon shown what
their actual battle formation was like
some signal must have passed between
them for swiftly as at a word of com-
mand they began milling this way and
that moving for a few seconds in what
looked like hopeless confusion another
instant and the full extent of the ma-
neuver stood revealed

  the entire mass of the spheres had
formed into a hollow globe so that the
full force of their rays could be con-
centrated in any given direction at any
given moment

  another sign i imagined if one were
needed that the adosians fully realized
they were fighting a losing fight-the
old business of a hollow square over
again adapted this time to space con-
ditions they were it seemed no longer
prepared to take the initiative

  no sooner was the idea formed in my
mind than circumstances combined to
shatter it in the completest fashion pos-
sible

  a great blaze of rays sprang from
the globe formed by the spheres it was
like holding a well-cut diamond up to
the light only infinitely more dazzling
the glare hurt the eyes it even pen-
etrated our closed eyelids leaving us
blinded and groping


amazing stories

  a warning instinct made me try to
draw my eyes away from the vision-
plate and a fascination for which i
could not account seemed to be holding
me there against my will but the full
realization of the horror that must fol-
low swept over me like a wave and
helped me to break the chains of the
hideous inaction that held me

  i sprang for the infra-red glasses
yelling as i went for the others to get
theirs fumblingly i adjusted mine
the blessed wonderful relief that they
gave

  not content now with torturing our
sight the spheres had begun whirling
even with our glasses and the lights
toned down so that it no longer stabbed
our eyes like red-hot needles we were
dizzied and dazzled by the constant mo-
tion it was impossible to see the
spheres themselves so fast were they
rotating that they moved inside an ap-
parently solid globe of light like quills
on a porcupine little fretful stabs of
green began to interlace the design one
every now and then reaching out cath-
erine-wheel-like into space

  i didnt like the look of that some-
thing was going to happen soon some-
thing that wouldnt be too much to our
taste i looked at marian at spain and
arabella something of the tension had
communicated itself to them

  the worst of it was that we were
forced to inaction our hands tied we
could do nothing until the fiag-ship sig-
nalled and then the result was in the
hands of the mechanicians who had
come on board recently a queer kind
of war a battle of lights and invisible
forces annihilation dealt out by the
touch of a switch or the turn of a
lever yet clean and wholesome in one
way it did not leave men torn and
maimed it killed them completely or
passed them by

  came there the tinkle of the televiso-
phonic bell our mechanician jumped
to it with an apology to me as he passed
for doing so i said nothing i was
only in control the actual dealing out
of destruction must be left to those
qualified to do it

  a splutter of instructions loud enough
for us all to hear them too technical
for us to understand came through   
the man acknowledged receipt of them
and came back to us with a smile on
his face

  massed attack then open order and
hit where wc can he said to me he
might as well have been speaking in
greek

  sundry queer gadgets had been
brought on board from the flagship-
box-like camera affairs heavy enough
for all their lack of size long deadly-
looking cylinders and other pieces of
apparatus all beyond me-and in the
interval of traveling had been fixed in
various parts of the ship and connected
up with a new bank of keys erected in
the control-room the mechanician took
his stand over the keys

  i know what to do sir he explained
directional orders for the ships will
come over the televisophone as long as
we can hold communication youd bet-
ter have it tuned up to full speaking
strength if you dont mind me making
a suggestion

  i nodded spain i said you take
the televisophone to pass on anything
i dont get marian i want your help
here at control arabella    well i
dont know for the moment what you
can do

  the mechanic looked up with a cheer-
ful grin i can do with an assistant
he said i think he liked the look of
the grim set of arabellas mouth

  take her i said wearily

  our orders came through almost at
that exact instant full speed ahead
terror out of space



until we were almost in touch with the
green rays we were not to get within
actual reach of them however

  our rockets thundered the me-
chanic and arabella under his direc-
tion played some sort of a devils sym-
phony on the clicking keys a huge
red beam from our nose darted out
to join a perfect forest of them pro-
jected from the other ships the whole
round of the void seemed crimson with
the fires of hell no thing of human
construction i thought could exist long
in the tremendous heat generated by
those rays yet to my amazement they
seemed to spin off the whirling globe
of light as a sunbeam is reflected from
a mirror or more correctly as an
arrow is turned aside by a shield

  well have to give em dido some
other way the cheerful mechanic re-
marked theyre not at home to that
i thought we might get near enough to
use the martians paralyzing ray the
trouble before has been it couldnt be
used in the void must have something
to travel in like air but foster-
youve heard of him-found some sort
of carrier beam we could use and the
deeds done

  he looked in the vision-plate then
back at the bank of keys in front of
him the needle on a little recording
dial there was flickering agitatedly back
and forth

  field of force sir he remarked
youll notice that globes turning green
now like the haze round ados itself
well well have to give them some anti-
stuff the other ships seem to be tun-
ing up too ill trouble you for all
the power the generators can give us
sir

  the order went through the me-
chanic pressed a key an instant later
the whole ship seemed to quiver she

shook in every part so that i thought
she would fly to pieces the mechanic
must have read my thoughts

  no need to worry mr harper he
said shell hold all we can give her
all the ships are tested for twice the
power wc can develop here were in
the center of a sort of anti-magnetic
field so to speak and the tendency is
for everything to fly as far from every-
thing else as it can if the ship wasnt
properly insulated you would see most
things starting to fly asunder doesnt
seem to have much effect on the spheres
so far

  he spoke a moment loo soon as
our heads dipped together over the
vision-plate it seemed that the globe
of light was dimming tt became al-
most transparent so that the massed
spheres inside were partially visible it
bent like a pressed bubble the first in-
timation we had had that it was an
actual tangible creation then like a
pricked bubble it burst but probably
that was only because the rays that had
created it were shut off simultane-
ously

  then as we looked the mass of spheres
broke apart like ants when an ant-hill is
kicked by a boot some of them most
of them in fact those furthest away
from us shot out into the void piling
headlong in full flight but others
those nearest which had caught the full
force of that first eddy of power seemed
to swell distended like bladders blown
to bursting point then burst in their
turn

  the mechanic was right everything
in them must instantaneously have blown
apart they erupted in all directions
in silent explosions only the back
kick of their released gases caught and
bounced us miles out into the void

  it was a full hour before our scattered


amazing stories

fleet came together again fortunately
there had been no casualties in the
meantime our flagship had got in touch
with the retreating martian fleet and
ordered them back to meet us and refit
with the new weapons

  the mechanic had the last word not
a cheerful one by any means

  well it worked this time he re-
marked but i dont quite know that
it will again

  what do you mean i demanded

  he brushed his hair back from his
forehead with a grimy hand before he
answered

  seems to me he said at length
that if were going to use power
against that green screen of theirs in
the same proportion that we used it now
were going to lose so much force that
the lord knows what it will do

  in what way  i asked quickly
with half an idea of what he was driving
at

  this way he returned gloomily for
once you saw what it did to those
spheres well imagine it used propor-
tionally strong enough to deal with a
whole planetoid

  i gasped at the vision the suggestion
conjured up in my mind

  i see i said thoughtfully of
course it might blow ados to pieces
disintegrate the planetoid in fact

  he nodded thats not the worst
we dont know what effect it would
have on earth or the moon besides the
back kick theres the upsetting of the
gravitational relation of the three bodies
to consider probably wed find the
moon drawing closer to earth you
know what that would mean tidal
waves earthquakes and general hell to
pay

  certainly by no means an inviting
prospect to face

chapter xxvii
ados

he full story of that fateful
attack on ados is not mine to
tell i saw only my own partic-
ular section -ef it and i can write only
of what came under my own notice but
those who would acquaint themselves
with the fuller story of that short
campaign will find it set out at length in
the book of warnings which the
new laws of all the habitable worlds
now agree young planetarians must
learn to read from their tenderest years
perhaps in its study they may be taught
to avoid those mistakes of fact and
errors of judgment that for long pre-
vented anything approaching the unity
of our peoples so much for that

  we were days behind the retreating
spheres we liad halted not only to
rent the new martian detachment but
also to overhaul and test every possible
working part of our ships the fate
of two worlds depended on our pre-
paredness and bo-kar and his earth
colleagues had no intention of proceed-
ing until they had satisfied themselves
that nothing human ingenuity could
achieve had been left undone

  well i remember our second glimpse
of ados that dark surfaced planetoid
with its shell of green haze the latter
was brighter and more luminous than
when we had last seen it our instru-
ments showed that its influence was
stronger the question to be decided
was whether as an armor to the plan-
etoid it could stand up against our im-
proved weapons

  we bad expected to be met on the
way by a host of spheres a collection
of that vast amiada ados had gathered
for our subjugation but to our sur-
prise we sighted none there was a
terror out of space



reason for this though it did not appear
until later

  as a matter of fact i fancy our com-
mander was a trifle nonplussed at the
lack of welcome a trifle puzzled too
as well he might be however since
we had grounds enough for adopting the
offensive as soon as we were within
the gravitational influence of ados the
vibratory anti-magnetic rays were turned
on the screen

  we watched our little section of that
world our hearts in our mouths mindful
of what our mechanic had prophesied
but for long enough though the drain
on our generators grew pronounced
nothing happened

  at last just when we were beginning
to think that the one weapon on which
all hopes and fears were centered was
going to prove ineffective the unex-
pected occurred the screen shivered a
little it dipped in the center the
luminosity became less pronounced i
think some of us cheered someone else
gave a cry of dismay at the very mo-
ment when victory of a sort seemed
within our grasp the tide bade fair to
turn against us

  from behind ados from that face of
it which we had never seen there came
hurtling sphere after sphere in a never-
ending stream thousands of spheres
rounding the planetoid high above us
ravening birds of prey dropping down
to overwhelm us by sheer force of num-
bers it seemed as though they must
blanket us by their own weight and
drive us down to ados to perish

  i know i stood stunned uncertain
what to do in that instant of surprise
the mechanic gunner electrician or
whatever he cared to call himself was
in no such pass he whistled cheerfully
shouted some sort of orders to ara-
bella and went to work banging at the
keys himself

  a dead-white ray leaped vertically

from our nose reached up and stabbed
into the middle of the descending spheres
then came another and another until the
sky above us appeared roofed over by
them we could see the spheres through
them staggering and reeling the under-
most ones at any rate pitching and toss-
ing this way and that

  control mr harper the mechanic
shouted abruptly theyll be on us if
we dont watch out

  it was true the lower spheres com-
pletely out of control were falling di-
rectly towards us they were falling
slowly however i fancied from the
look of things that their gravitational
screens were still running automatically
and until the power governing them ran
out they would flutter down rather than
fall

  it was now more or less each ship
for itself and in the absence of spe-
cific orders i did what i thought best
we easily cleared the lower spheres but
the others above were still under con-
trol the dead-white carrier ray of our
paralyzing beams had not reached them
but they could not get at us because
of the blanket of their own craft

  the moment we emerged from that
blanket however they began to strike
at us with their green rays the trouble
with them though was that their action
was not instantaneous it took a couple
of seconds for the green pencil to reach
out and heat up its objective to the point
of incandescence on the other hand
our paralyzing ray on which we pre-
ferred to rely at this juncture rather
than on the red heat beams acted at
once the carrier took them right
through the outer shells of the spheres
through the vacuum space between and
through the inner shells plunging their
crews into a state of coma instantly

  we did not have it all our own way
every now and then a green ray cling-
ing tenaciously to a planetarian ship


amazing stories

sent it off in a burst of incandescent
dust a number of other ships were
damaged seriously by the repercussions
of the bursts

  by some miracle of chance we and
some halt dozen other ships presently
found ourselves unscathed high above
the conflict only a few isolated spheres
being on the same plane but they
seemed to be out of control for they
were drifting aimleslsy about one i
noticed particularly something had
started it rotating and as it swept round
on its own axis the green ray like a
stained finger sticking out from it
whirled round and round too

  the spheres beneath us were less
massed now we could see ados could
see too tliat while a section of our
fleet was engaging them another section
was apparently training the anti-mag-
netic power oil the planetoid

  the green haze dipped and swayed
alarmingly its high lights had died
almost completely away though every
now and then like the embers of a burnt-
out fire they flared for an instant to
life again yet the force rays generated
by our fleet were gaining

  mindful of what the mechanic had
said i watched fascinated  i had noth-
ing else to do we were merely hover-
ing now and the mechanic was doing
the work sending paralyzing ray or heat
beam stabbing this way and that as the
opportunity offered so it was that i
saw a section of that last act of the
drama

  of a sudden the green haze screen
a gigantic bubble swelled to enormous
proportions became so tenuous that one
could see through it and abruptly van-
ished as though it had never been for
a moment the planetoid seemed to rock
then a great blast of air roaring upwards
into space drove through the spheres and
inter-planetary ships alike scattering
them like chaff before the wind we in

the tellus seemed to be thrown every
which way at once but luckily none of
us were hurt i picked myself up at
once and jumped to the control afraid
that we would be hurled up against the
under surface of the moon and dashed
to pieces but the blast had not been
strong enough for that and as i got
the tellus back on her course and
started to descend to our former level
i saw that others of our ships were
being brought about in their turn

  but ados seemed different as we drew
near it the green haze was gone we
were looking down on a bleak bare
world i think i jumped lo the right
conclusion then and there afterward
some of the spheres were captured and
since they still contained air some of
the crews were alive though in a state
of temporary paralysis they were the
only live adosians we saw the value
of their capture however lay in the
fact that we put the martian thought
machines on them and thus obtained
enough information to supplement what
we discovered of our own accord

  ages ago it seemed ados had an
atmosphere but like the moon its air
eventually began to escape into space
the adosian being a slothful enough
creature apparently was content as long
as science found a means of retaining
that atmosphere the difficulty was
solved by the production of a power-
ceiling extending all over the planet
air water and food were made syn-
thetically as natural supplies failed but
it was not until with the passage of
long centuries the natural elements from
which the synthetic products were made
began to fail that the adosian bestirred
himself sufficiently to look for an alter-
native to the extinction that faced the
race frantic experiments covering a
period of about eighty or ninety of our
years culminated at last in the construc-
tion of the progenitor of the present
terror out of space



spheres they were extremely clumsy
however the first ones that went out
were lost in space but spurred on to
further efforts by the threat of doom
hanging over their heads the adosians
at last evolved a reliable article then
began exploration earth as the nearest
habitable body offered them exceptional
advantages the difficulty of increased
gravity there could be overcome arti-
ficially and probably the race would
sooner or later evolve a type that could
stand the gravitational pull of the planet
without any undue discomfort that
at any rate was their theory

  it was a desperate chance the ado-
sians were taking and they put long
years of preparation into their work
before they dared make a move and
then at the last when they seemed with-
in measurable distance of making their
one ruthless stroke the uncounted factor
of the martian conquest of space ap-
peared to upset their plans they had
to proceed more slowly and more cau-
tiously because of that for quite
wrongly as we know they sensed in
the martians rivals for the possession
of earth

  the power curtain was charged with
those repelling influences that made it
an effective armor for the surface of
the planetoid and under its protection
preparations went forward on even a
vaster scale than before but for that
lucky accident of bo-kar kidnapping us
the adosians would probably have suc-
ceded in subjugating earth first and then
the other planets in their turn


we came down to the surface of
ados after the battle but it was
impossible to venture forth without the
protective space-suit equipment the
mechanic had been wrong when he had
asserted that the force beams we had
directed against the green screen would
shatter ados as they had shattered the

spheres he had overlooked several
vital facts the spheres were hollow
bodies with an atmospheric pressure in-
side of roughly about fifteen pounds
to the square inch and the vacuum of
space outside the walls of the spheres
however had been built to withstand
that pressure from inside and stand rigid
under a force that constantly strove to
split them asunder the effect of our
force beams was to press the walls of
the spheres inwards against that pres-
sure and in pressing them relentlessly
it weakened them so that they simply
flew to pieces ados on the other hand
was a solid body our rays were not
likely to shatter it as they had shattered
the spheres

  but one effect they had that no one
seems to have counted on under their
influence ados rocked and was pushed
back and then forward a little but
ados was moving with the earth and
moon in an orbital path round the sun
the force of that revolution as opposed
to the gravitational pull of the sun kept
it in a state of equilibrium the mo-
mentary push of our force rays merely
made it behave like a coiled spring under
pressure the moment the pressure was
released it sprang back to its original
position

  but one cannot interfere safely in the
slightest degree with the forces of na-
ture and in that sense the mechanic
had been right in his surmise there
were earthquakes and tidal waves on
earth much damage was done and many
lives lost that was the price we paid
for our future security not so great a
price as the adosians paid for their
attempted invasion of our planet

  with the exception of those few re-
covered from the spheres in a state of
coma-they were taken to the earth
and for some years were objects of
interest there until the last of them
pined away and died-the whole of the


amazing stories

population of ados died suddenly and
violently the instant our force beams
succeeded in puncturing the green haze
that hung like a protecting shell over
the planetoid as the haze exploded
into nothingness the atmosphere beneath
rushed out into space-that was the blast
which hurled us upward-and the eter-
nal cold of the void rushed in it was
a lifeless frozen world on which we
descended some hours later

  it is not my place to tell here of the
wonders we found even a sketchy ac-
count would fill a volume interested
readers nf adult age will find them fully
set out in the book of warnings the
youngsters are only too familiar with
them already but even the martians
admit they can learn much from the
adosian records many of which we

have at last succeeded in translating
and already we are adapting for our
own use some of the powers the sci-
entists of that planetoid discovered for
themselves

  some of us looking back now do
not care to think of how through acci-
dent rather than of set purpose we
wiped out a world even though we
realize it was we or they but i myself
think that good may eventually come
out of it if only that it has taught us
the full horrors of inter-planetary war-
fare where quarter can be neither given
nor received i dn not believe that after
that lesson we people of the inner plan-
ets are ever likely to quarrel with each
other and i hope with all my heart that
we may never see the launching of
another terror out of space

tr qrimshaws
            sanitarium

           by fletcher pratt

many of the functions of the human organizations are subject to great
beneficial or unfortunate effects from the operation of the ductless glands
some affect the growth making a man large or small many cases of
gigantism are due to the pituitary gland so that a circtis giant may be looked
upon as abnormal independent of his size we are only at the beginning
of the appreciation of the functions of the mysterious glands in the human
system and operations on the size of human beings may yet enter into regular
	medical practise

                     illustrated by morey

note by the editors the follow-
ing manuscript is one of the
results of the famous grim-
shaw sanitarium scandal an event which
in its day made a tremendous stir cost
a state superintendent of hospitals his
post and turned the course of an elec-
tion but every state has its scandals
of this type it is seldom that their
reveberations extend beyond the im-
mediate locality and for the benefit
of those who have not heard of or do
not remember the grimshaw case we
will briefly rehearse the known facts

  dr adelbert grimshaw a physician
of german extraction opened a private
sanitarium for nervous cases at go-
wanda near the grounds occupied by
the state hospital for the insane it
was a very select institution catering
to the wealthiest patients and the high
fees dr grimshaw secured from them
enabled him to establish a charity ward
in which with admirable public spirit
he labored to improve the condition of
the indigent feeble-minded

  dr grimshaw appears to have effected
some remarkable cures in insanity cases

several well-attested instances of com-
plete recovery from paranoia are rec-
orded under his ministrations at the
same time it was noted that a good many
patients died at his sanitarium and later
investigation revealed that these belonged
to two classes-wealthy patients whose
relatives were at a great distance and
both poor and wealthy patients who had
no relatives at all

  it was the case of harlan ward that
led to the scandal this unfortunate
young man the son of the famous auto-
mobile manufacturer was committed to
grimshaws sanitarium by his parents
and wife in the autumn of  in an
effort to cure him of the liquor habit
he was duly discharged as cured some
eight months later but about a year after
his discharge it was discovered that he
had begun to take drugs and he was re-
turned to the institution some time
after this while his wife and parents
were in europe they received a cable-
gram from dr grimshaw announcing
the death of the young man they at
once returned to the united states and
made arrangements for the removal of
	amazing stories

he looked down at us with a kindly smile for a moment and then began to
shout his voice was so extremely loud and deep that i had no little
difficulty in understanding what he was saying
dr grimshaws sanitarium



the body from the place where it had
been temporarily interred at the trinity
episcopal chapel of gowanda to the
family vault at short hills long island
while passing through new york city
the hearse carrying the casket was struck
by another car the hearse was over-
turned and the casket broken it proved
to contain instead of the body of har-
lan ward a dummy dressed in his
clothes and stuffed with sand the face
being represented by an ingenious wax
mask

  there was an immediate investiga-
tion in the course of which many facts
came to light the most striking of
these was that in nearly every case of
patients whose death at the sanitarium
had been reported by dr grimshaw the
body was similarly missing and a sand-
stuffed dummy was substituted in the
coffin none of these bodies has ever
been discovered the death certificates
had all been signed by dr grimshaw
himself

  this sensational discovery was fol-
lowed by the arrest of dr benjamin
voyiia grimshaws chief assistant pa-
pers found in the safe of the grim-
shaw sanitarium showed beyond doubt
that it had been made the headquarters
of a gang engaged in distributing nar-
cotics and that both dr grimshaw and
dr voyna were deeply engaged in the
traffic it was undoubtedly at the san-
itarium itself that harland ward had
contracted the drug habit that proved
his ruin

  of the other facts uncovered by the
police there were two of such singular
character that the present manuscript
appears to afford the only adequate ex-
planation for them however fantastic it
may seem one of these was tliat while
running a sanitarium and a drug ring
dr grimshaw apparendy found time for
the breeding of large numbers of cats
over thirty were found in and about the

premises by the state police when they
raided the place the other and more
extraordinary fact was that dr grim-
shaw through a chain of agents seems
to have been engaged in the peculiar
business of supplying circuses and vaude-
ville impressarios with dwarfs

  most of these midgets as is not un-
usual were morons and many of them
were both drug-users and drug-peddlers

  dr voyna ultimately received a jail
sentence of five years the heaviest al-
lowable for dope peddling under the
laws of the united states grimshaw
was never apprehended warned no
doubt by the first newspaper accounts
of the bursting of the ward casket he
took to flight and has not been found
since if he is ever arrested it is doubt-
ful whether any charge but drug-ped-
dling will lie against him the laws of
new york require that a body shall be
produced before a charge of murder
can be substantiated the corpus delicti
and as we have stated not one of the
bodies of his victims has been found
investigation of the doctors past career
showed that he had been a graduate
of heidelberg and jena where he took
high honors in endocrinology but that
he later lost his german license on ac-
count of malpractice his original name
was grundhausen

  as to the present manuscript when
the state troopers raided the grimshaw
sanitarium they found it nearly empty
in the search for incriminating evidence
which followed one of the troopers
found three gelatine capsules in a corner
by the fireplace in the reception room
he dropped them into his pocket and
forgot about them until some time later
when he examined them he found they
contained something white imagining it
might be drugs of some kind he turned
them over to the state medical ex-
aminer

  the medical inspector opened one of


amazing stories

the capsules and found that it held a
small wad of exceedingly thin paper ap-
parently cut or tom from the edge of a
thin-paper edition of the bible he
noted that something was written on the
paper in minute characters with the
aid of a microscope he was able to de-
cipher the writing which was finer than
anything but the finest known engraving
like the first the other capsules con-
tained strips of paper and when the
whole had been deciphered and arranged
in its obvious order the following man-
uscript resulted it will be noted that
there is a gap in the story representing
probably another capsule which has not
yet been found

into whatever hands this may fall
t pray to god that the finder will
lay it before the police at the
earliest opportunity i herewith
lay a complaint that dr grimshaw
is engaged in the drug traffic dr voy-
na his assistant must be involved also

  i fear that in spite of my precautions
this will fall into grimshaws hands if
so it will only provide that good doc-
tor with a view of how he looks to
other people-sherman and kraicld
arthur kaye and myself dr grim-
shaw we salute you behold your mir-
ror-a mirror set in a skull as it were
-for we speak to you as men already
dead and you unknown finder and
reader of this last testament of a dy-
ing man if you be not grimshaw him-
self will you do me the last favor that
even the condemned of the scaffold may
ask a small thing-merely to inform
miss millicent armhnister of  wal-
lace avenue buffalo that john doherty
is indeed dead

  then put the police on the trail the
officers will no doubt be skeptical-ask
them to make an examination of the cof-
fin that supposedly contains the remains
of arthur kaye

  i may as well start my story at the
beginuing lest i be taken for one of the
sad souls that infest this place merely
maundering under a delusion of persecu-
tion i have no such mania neither am
i one of the dipsomaniacs and drug-
fiends kept here for cures strangely
ironic word my name is john doherty
i am a graduate of hamilton college
class of  a member of the theta
alpha fraternity and a detective by
profession i was led into the business
by a certain taste for romance and a
physical development that caused me to
become a member of most of the athletic
teams at college

  i had been working for the pinkerton
agency for some time when they sent
me as additional guard with a money
shipment from buffalo to philadelphia
the messenger in charge of it was sus-
pected of double-dealing it was essen-
tial that extra protection be provided
and i was locked with him in the bag-
gage car the journey was a long one
the motion of the train soporific i
suppose i dozed i was wakened by a
flicker of motion as the messenger drew
his gun and we both fired at practically
the same moment my bullet killed him
his just grazed my skull rendering me
unconscious

  when i had recovered from the in-
jury i found some difficulty in concen-
trating enough attention on my work to
do it properly and my employers as a
matter of gratitude decided to send me
to dr grimshaws sanitarium which
had already achieved a considerable rep-
utation through the remarkable success
of the doctor in handling just such cases

  i was received with extreme courtesy
subjected to a searching series of in-
quiries as to my tastes habits and past
life and then given a series of tests that
were readily recognizable as modified
binet-simon examinations it seemed
rather unnecessary as a man with a
dr grimshaws sanitarium



college diploma is supposed to be beyond
that sort of thing i fancy but i made
no comment imagining that dr grim-
shaw knew his business he did-to
my infinite cost

  at the sanitarium i was given a pleas-
ant room and very little by way of oc-
cupation i was kept in at all times save
during meals and for a short period in
the afternoon when all the patients were
taken for exercise to a large park or
garden with a small stream running
through it during this period i en-
countered arthur kaye a large man
with a high forehead who was under
treatment for dipsomania a man named
kraicki a decayed polish aristocrat of a
sort who was troubled apparently with
a chronic weak-mindedness sherman
the interne in charge of our wing to
whom i felt considerably drawn by
common tastes in literature and art

  there was little to do in the park
but to sit and talk with these three we
formed a more or less self-sustaining
group somewhat separated from the
other patients and internes about us

  for a time we attempted to amuse
ourselves by playing bridge but this
resource proved futile kraicki was
totally incapable of keeping his mind on
the game ahd would ask the most ab-
surdly naive questions about what he
should do when he held four aces nat-
urally the enforced idleness began to
become somewhat wearisome i am of
an intensely active temperament and
have led an active life and i began to
cudgel my brains for something to do
even a covert breaking of rules struck
me as a fascinating occupation at least
it would provide me with something to
plan and accomplish

  searching about for a rule to break in
the most interesting way i hit on the
problem of the wall at the left side
of the park a high stone wall separated
our bourne from that where the charity

patients were confined sherman re-
marked one day that nobody but grim-
shaw himself and his leading assistant
voyna were allowed beyond it and the
building in which the charity patients
were kept was only connected with the
main body of the sanitarium by a kind
of covered passage to get over that
wall and solve the mystery of the seclu-
sion of the charity patients-that would
be an enterprise worthy of accomplish-
ment

  so one afternoon just before we were
called for the regular period of exercise

i arranged a dummy in my bed after
the exercise period as we emerged from
the dining room a more or less disorder-
ly group i slipped around a comer into
the operating room and waited behind
the door till the attendants who brought
up the rear of the procession had passed
then back into the dining room and out
one of the vindows into the park again
there t concealed myself in a little
group of maples by the edge of the
stream until darkness came i knew the
night attendant in the halls would flash
his lamp through the peep-hole in the
door of my room but trusted to the
dummy as i have many times done in
detective work to deceive him

  after the lights in the building went
out i searched along the wall until i
found a tree growing against it scaled
it with some little difficulty and dropped
down on the other side i found myself
in another exercise yard-not so large
nor so well carpeted with grass as ours
and without the stream it was entirely
shut in by a lofty wall crowned with
spikes on every side save that where i
came over

  the windows of the charity patients
building were barred like ours think-
ing myself more or less of a fool and
my adventure a rather paltry one i
tried the door more to assure myself of
the impossibility of entering than for


amazing stories

any other reason to my surprise it was
unlocked in the lower hall there was
a single dim light but the building was
silent save for a subdued moaning from
somewhere upstairs the maniacs who
formed dr grimshaws more serious
cases were usually making some noise
of that sort so i gave the matter no
thought

  i was about to try the upper floor
to see what i could observe through the
peep-holes when i heard the grating of
a key in the lock at the end of the cov-
ered passage the outer door was too
far away to be attempted with any pros-
pect of success i must find conceal-
ment and quickly fortunately a large
clothes hamper stood in the hall  into it
i leaped and by the grace of the gods
found it empty save for a couple of
towels through its sides i could get a
somewhat imperfect view of the hall
and i saw that the newcomers were three
in number-grimshaw voyna and a boy
of aboyt twelve i should judge

  they passed me so closely that their
clothes brushed my place of concealment
and they turned on the light in the room
by whose door the hamper stood i was
unable to see what they were doing but
grimshaws voice rose sharp and clear

  youd better be reasonable and take
your medicine it will relieve the pain

  a second voice replied but i wont
take it i tell you i know what it is its
dope you can do what you like you
made a midget out of me but you aint
going to make no dope fiend out of me

  the voice was neither grimshaws nor
voynas i had heard both often enough
it must therefore belong to the boy and
then the startling connotation of the
speech struck me-it was no boy but a
dwarf or midget

  you wont take it eh said grim-
shaw with a kind of suppressed fury
in his voice ill show you and i
heard the sound of a blow

  no i wont said the voice rising
near tears

  wait a minute this was voyna
speaking thats not the way grim-
shaw you cant bully these americans
show him how much he will gain by it
look here-you take the medicine the
doctor is good enough to prescribe for
you and in a short time you will not
only be well enough to be discharged
but we will find you a position in which
you will make more money than you ever
saw before

  you go to hell said the third
voice it had a singularly boyish timbre
that touched me  i wont take your
dope and wont peddle your dope look
at tony gasbotta hes peddling dope-
his speech was broken by the sound
of another blow and somewhere one of
the maniac patients began to shout

  shut the door will you ben said
grimshaw and that was the last i
heard

  my muscles were cramped by the con-
finement but i lost no time in escap-
ing from the hamper and the building i
wondered whether they had been giving
me drugs in my food how many of the
sanitariums employees were in on this
business and what lay behind all these
sinister manifestations you made a
midget out of me-what could it mean

i judged however that sherman was
honest enough else he would have been
admitted to whatever grisly secrets the
charity building held as to habit-
forming drugs in our food i was not so
sure but it didnt look like it if they
had to coerce the dwarf into taking the
dope and then the whole thing might
be the result of a maniacs imagination

i had no guarantee the dwarf was sane

  nevertheless i slept beneath the
trees that night i feared that i might
run into grimshaw or voyna in the
halls and if they were actually engaged
in any such shady business as it seemed
dr grimshaws sanitarium



such an encounter would be dangerous
to the last degree in the morning i
entered by the same way i had left the
building hid in the operating room
again and joined the crowd at breakfast
after which i went to my room and de-
stroyed the dummy just what to do
was a problem but i reasoned that
sherman would tell me better than any-
body else what lay behind it for even
if he were not involved he could add
much corroborative information to what
knowledge of the events i had if he
should prove one of the gang then i
must trust to strength and speed to
escape

  that afternoon during the exercise
period i told him the whole story kaye
and kraicki hung around and heard it
too-somehow i couldnt seem to get rid
of them

  my god said sherman when i had
finished so thats why   and he
stopped

  thats why what t asked

  why no one but voyna is allowed
in the charity wing or on the third floor
of this building he said i always
thought it was queer

  but are you sure theyre not putting
drugs in our food i asked

  he gave a little laugh hardly pos-
sible he said there are too many
people here and too many visitors no
that would be crude moreover there
are too many internes here someone
would be sure to notice the taste tt
is very characteristic

  that was a relief at all events as
to the question of whether grimshaw
and voyna were actually engaged in the
drug traffic sherman seemed not quite
certain but judged that the best pro-
cedure would be to certify me cured get
me out and let me return with search
warrants and police and check up on
that mysterious charity ward leaving

the problem at that point we went to
dinner

  the table was unusually quiet that
night and i imagine it must have grated
on kraickis rather frayed nerves at
all events before any of us could check
him he burst out with

  i know whats the matter theyre
all mad at you dr grimshaw because
you peddle dope i slid a plate to the
floor where it broke with a crash but
it was too late-my action only served
to emphasize the indiscretion of the
speech crimshaw darted a sudden look
at us and making some excuse left the
table trouble was in the air

  after the meal the doctor summoned
kraicki to his office i knew things
would very likely be stirring that night
so i did not even bother to undress
merely turned out my light and waited
by the door for what was coming

  sure enough along about one oclock
the door creaked slowly open and a
hand holding a flashlight was extended
through the aperture i snatched the
wrist pulling the holder clear in and off
balance with my left hand at the same
time striking out with all my force with
the other hand my blow struck full
in the intruders face and he went down
as though pole-axed but grimshaw
had been fully forearmed as the first
man went down a second gripped me by
the knees and when i bent to care for
him a third leaped on my back i put
up a good battle but they were too many
for me they got me down and strapped
tight and not till then did someone turn
on the light i saw grimshaw standing
over me dabbing a blooded mouth with
his handkerchief

  so he said and i could not but
admire the mans calmness you have
delusions of persecution you imagine
i am trying to give you and other pa-
tients cocaine i am afraid my treat-
ment has not been altogether successful


amazing stories

in your case you will have to take
another treatment-a long one mr
doherty he looked incredibly benign-
ant i began to speak

  come come dont excite yourself
im going to give you something to
quiet your nerves he said and flashed
out a hypodermic with which he pro-
ceeded to give me an injection

  i lost consciousness under the effects
of the drug and when i recovered it was
morning i woke in a different room
it must have been on the third floor the
forbidden floor for i could see the tops
of trees beyond the barred window

  i was kept there for a long time
just how long i am uncertain for i lost
all count of the hours during most of
the period i was in a straight-jacket
and once i was operated on somewhere
at the front of the skull for i recollect
my head being held firmly in a plaster
cast after the operation and an infinite
feeling of nausea as the effect of the
anaesthetic wore off

  every day a rough looking chap fed
me from a spoon and every night grim-
shaw returned to give me another hypo-
dermic injection i felt terribly ill and
depressed all that time in the morning
i would wake with a blinding head-
ache that would last out the day leav-
ing me weak as a kitten i began to de-
velop hallucinations too the room
seemed to grow perceptibly in size and
the strait jacket became looser

  one day when i felt better than usual
i made an attempt to wriggle out of the
now thoroughly loosened straight-jacket
it succeeded and i lay still on the bed
in a mood of profound self-congratula-
tion when grimshaw entered i would
rise and strike him to the floor-a poor
revenge but better than none and
there was always the chance of getting
past the opened door out and away

  but all my dreams came to nothing
i was so weakened by long confinement

and pain that he handled me as though
i were a child-and here again i noted
a curious thing he seemed at least a
head taller than i and i am a six-footer
how could that be drugs were the
only explanation i could fit to it at the
time

  the period succeeding this futile at-
tempt to escape is all a haze for me shot
by macabre impressions i remember
once being taken out on the balcony for
air and once imagining that i saw kaye
on the next balcony muffled in a straight
jacket even as i was but there could
be no certainty and the muffled figure
did not speak and the dreams-the
dreams i imagined myself as light as
a feather great giants wandered about
my room with huge weapons in their
hands hideous creatures

  my first clear consciousness was when
grimshaw told us all about it one
night the evening meal was not fol-
lowed by the usual injection and the
morning brought the first surcease from
pain in-god alone knows how long i
woke with my eyes on a ceiling that
seemed miles overhead and when i
looked at the foot of the bed it ap-
peared to have retreated to an infinite
distance the room was gigantic   

  grimshaw came in a moment later
he carried a bundle in his arms and to
my wondering eyes he looked fifteen
feet tall he came right over to the
bed and deposited his bundle there and
with infinite astonishment i saw it was
arthur kaye that big man with the
high forehead yet small enough to be
carried like a habv by a dr grimshaw
grown titanic in size a few moments
later the doctor returned with another
bundle and then a third-and they con-
tained sherman and kraicki as the first
had contained kaye

  he looked down at us with a kindly
smile for a moment and then began to
shout his voice was so extremely loud
dr grimshaws sanitarium



and deep that i had no little difficulty in
understanding what he was saying but
i set it down as nearly as possible

  allow me to congratulate you four
gentlemen you are the subjects of a
classical experiment-one that will un-
doubtedly place me in the front rank of
the worlds endocrinologists and will
hand your names down to posterity

  you dr sherman will have already
understood the nature of the experiment
i liave performed to the rest i must
offer a few words of explanation suit-
able to their somewhat limited intelli-
gences there are certain glands in the
body gentlemen which are called thy-
roid parathyroid and pituitary glands
they are known as the ductless glands
and have no obvious function but it
has been discovered that if the pituitary
or thyroid glands of a young animal say
a sheep or dog are destroyed the animal
will be a dwarf in other words these
glands in some way unknown to most
scientists control the growth of the
animal

  investigation has also shown that an
injured pituitary or thyroid gland in the
human individual produces equally curi-
ous results-giants seven-footers seen in
circuses being the product of insufficient
gland activity even in adults these
glands are known to produce certain ef-
fects dr haussler has recorded how
an abnormally active pituitary gland
caused a mans fingers to become short
wide and stubby long after he was fully
grown

  these endocrine glands cause their
changes by releasing certain substances
into the blood stream among them being
various enzymes or yeasts which by a
complicated series of chemical reactions
bring about the changes indicated i
have given my life to the investigation
of these glands and their enzymes it
will gratify you dr sherman to know
that i have investigated over three

hundred cases of dwarfism and giantism
making elaborate blood and x-ray exam-
inations in time i became convinced
that a certain enzyme which i call
theta was responsible for all known
cases of dwarfism i have isolated
enzyme theta and found that a normally
active pituitary body secretes and re-
leases a counteracting enzyme to it thus
preserving the balance of the body it
then became a question whether i could
produce artificial dwarfism by damag-
ing the pituitary body and introducing
enzyme theta by subcutaneous injection

  animals did not give satisfactory re-
sults hence i was led to establish the
charity ward of this sanitarium and for
experiment secured a number of feeble-
minded human specimens whose absence
would not be noted i have succeeded in
producing midgets as small as two feet
ten inches in height by this means un-
fortunately it was impossible to release
them into the world as normal midgets
the civilization of this country being so
backward that scientific investigation of
a man as an animal is actually punish-
able therefore i have introduced these
midgets to the delights of cocaine and
maintain my control over them by fur-
nishing their supply of it

  but with you gentlemen i decided to
conduct the experiment on an altogether
higher plane you are already so fam-
iliar with the details of my business that
i could not release you even as cocaine
addicts consequently i have decided
by carcfully graduating the dosage of
enzyme theta to produce in you a series
of hyper-midgets in the cases of the
charity patients death always resulted
from such attempts but they were most-
ly in poor physical condition and their
mental weaknesses were such that cere-
bral collapse supervened you however
are not feeble-minded with the possible
exception of mr kraicki you are in ex-
cellent condition you show none of the

deleterious effects that have ruined my
experiments with the charity patients
and i shall proceed until i have re-
duced you to a size at which you will no
longer he dangerous or until your death
puts an end to the experiment

  your chances of survival are greatly
heightened by the fact that i have pro-
duced artificially a second enzyme
which i call enzyme omicron to sup-
plement enzyme theta both of these
substances are secreted in small quan-
tities by the hitherto little investigated
gland located-

  at this point occurs the distressing
lacuna in the manuscript a fact doubly
unfortunate since it deprives us of the
opportunity for a scientific check on the
extraordinary statements of dr grim-
shaw as reported by jack doherty the
other details of mr dohertys tale have
been in part confirmed by subsequent re-
search a pinkerton detective bearing
the name of dougherty was committed
to the grimshaw sanitarium in the early
part of  there was also a man
named arthur kaye there at the same
time under treatment for dipsomania
the names of kraicki and dr sherman
have not been traced the deaths of
doherty and kaye were reported by dr
grimshaw at widely separated intervals
that of doherty in  that of kaye
not till march  a miss millicent
armbruster did live at the address given
by doherty the city records show she
married a man named kellett in october
 after which all trace of her is lost

  when the story begins again with the
contents of the last capsule it is evident
that the experiment has entered its final
phase and that dr grimshaw had to a
degree lost interest in his four patients
it begins as it broke off-abruptly in
the middle of a sentence

  -stumbled over a grass root and we
had to stop for him the grass was
forest-like in its density and if he had

not waited i doubt if we would have
found him again the beetle escaped
and thus we missed a meal that night
also the garden was still too far away
to be made in the dark and kraicki was
too done up to go much further more-
over once at the garden our problem
would only be transferred for we would
have many wanderings to make before
discovering anything small enough for
our feeble efforts

  so we camped in a tuft of grass like
malays taking turns at watching
through the night it was bitterly cold
the piece of bandage was so rough it
rasped the skin and the three asleep had
to use all the silk for coverlets every
time i blundered into one of the grass
stems it would drench me with icy dew
like a shower bath

  in the morning kraicki always weak
and unstable became so feebly insistent
on not moving before he had had food
that we fairly had to drag him along
an hours wandering brought us to a
rotting twig that promised well as fuel
we pulled some of the decaying fibres
loose and burdened ourselves with them
they would be handy to make a fire
with provided we ever found anything
worth cooking over a fire as for the
method there was always the possibility
of striking a spark from a pebble with
the piece of watch-spring sherman had
found the day before

  a little further along sherman who
was then in the lead shouted we hur-
ried up to find him standing over a june-
bug which was lying on its back kick-
ing feebly i attacked the insect with a
piece of watch-spring but it was no
good his shell defied my best efforts
and i received a nasty scratch on the
back from his barbed legs as i tried to
slay him sherman suggested we turn
him over and work under the wing-
cases but i was afraid he would crawl
away before we could accomplish any-
dr grimshaws sanitarium



thing and our final decision was to
build a pyre over him and cook him as
he lay

  striking a spark from a stone may be
easy to those who arc familiar with the
art for me it was agonizing effort
when we did get our fire going the
heat excited so much activity on the
june-bugs part that it kicked over our
pile of wood and we were back where
we had started after that kaye and i
hunted up a pebble of some size and
heaving together we managed to smash
the animals head in there were a few
convulsive motions after that but for
the most part he lay still and we man-
aged to get the fire going in good shape

  the meat in the legs just where they
swell out before joining the body is the
best not unlike erab-meat to the taste
inside the body the meat was not so
thoroughly cooked and very fat besides
kraicki was the only one who would
cat it

  by the time we had finished with the
june-bug it was already late afternoon
the conference we held decided against
pushing on to the garden there was
a good deal of june-bug meat left and
we had before us now the problem of
shelter rather than that of food there
was also the question of weapons though
i solved this to some extent by worrying
loose the wing cases of the beetle and
splitting them down with the watch-
spring properly sharpened on a stone
they made not inefficient poinards
rough but good enough to attack in-
sects with

  kaye who was a bit of an antiquarian
essayed making a sling with the aid of
some tough grass fibres after con-
siderable practice he became quite expert
with this ungainly weapon with tiny
stones for ammunition he could knock
flies off distant grass-blades almost every
time-an interesting but impractical feat
as after the first attempt none of us

cared to try fly-meat again the odor
alone is enough to turn the stomach
once he did succeed in slaying a bee
however and we got some valuable food
from it and about a week later kaye
and his sling removed from our path a
very grim and ferocious-iooking spider
that we all hesitated to approach

  our mam difficulty was clothing
sherman offered the idea of working
around toward the park where we could
perhaps come by a handkerchief or some-
thing of the sort he pointed out that
the numerous trees would constitute an
advantage hnth in offering us ample
fuel and a place to live under the roots
and there was a possibility of getting
small fish out of the shallower reaches
of the creck

  it took us over a week to make the
long march but when we had accom-
plished it we were repaid for all our
labor at the border of the stream we
found a chair that one of the internes
must have left behind and with it not
only his medicine case but a book some
writing paper and a bottle of ink

  this was treasure-trove indeed kaye
and i hammered away at the catch of
the medicine case for half an hour with
the biggest stone we could lift and
finally managed to get it open beside
various oddments of no utility to us it
contained a bottle of quinine capsules
which were just what we wanted once
the quinine had been emptied out of
them they made ideal general carryalls
the bottle wc succceded in breaking and
with the sharp glass and a good deal of
patience fashioned useful tools and
weapons

  i thought it would be worth while to
write some kind of a record as long as
the gods had thrown the bottle of ink
and the paper in our way and with the
aid of the others managed to roll the
ink down to the headquarters we pres-
ently established under an arching tree-


amazing stories

root the paper was a wash-out how-
ever it was too heavy and the beetles
leg which was perforce the only pen i
had too scratchy

  by this time it was full day and we
were running chances by going back to
the things the interne had left but the
gain was worth the risk and i made
another attempt by great good for-
tune the book was brinkleys history
of japan-india paper with shermans
help i got a couple of the fly-leaves loose
and he had gone off with one when i
looked up and saw the menacing shape
of a man in the distance-grimshaw i
thought though from his height and the
distance i could not be certain leaving
the paper behind i fled

  i doubt whether i would have writ-
ten this record even then but for what
has happened since we were com-
fortably domiciled under our root in the
park living off grasshoppers of which
there seemed an unending supply and
making preparations for the winter
once we even caught a mole stabbed it
to death with our glass swords and
skinned it laboriously it furnished us
both good food and clothing sherman
developed uncanny skill with such poor

needles as we could contrive and even
kraicki contributed to the general fund
of welfare by the discovery that the
yellow hearts of grass stems have a de-
licious flavor when baked

  but three days ago there came a
change sherman and kraicki were out
hunting together i was in our home
trying out some darts i had made with
fragments of wood and glass points
when sherman hurst in panting with
speed and very pale

  whats the matter i asked and
wheres kraicki

  gone he said grimshaws got a
cat it found us

  then i saw it all

  so i am leaving this record there is
no more hope for us all that remains
is a chance however remote that these
capsules will fall into the hands of some
not too skeptical individual who will take
the trouble to investigate-the shadowy
chance of a delayed revenge which i
shall not live to see i only hope the
cat will not get me before i can secrete
these capsules in some place where they
will be found winter is coming we
dare not hunt for fear of the animal and
our food is running short

we recommend this story to readers of jeans and eddingtons fascinating
works for the white dwarf is no fairy creation but is a real thing
and the story concerns itself with the astronomical possibilities of future
changes in our little cosmos it gives a picture of astronomical possibili-
ties with a good bit of real human nature pervading its pages

illustrated by morey

there are few living today
who can remember the begin-
ning of the great migra-
tion fewer still who can re-
member what our world was
like in the old days for the very old are
apt to confuse the memories of their early
childhood with those of later years

  our histories tell the story our chil-
dren are taught these things in schools so
that they can relate all the strange and
marvelous facts but what does it all
mean to them  very little i fear

  they recite the name of robert san-
derson mechanically they tell you of his
greatness but it seems to me that they
look on him as a mythological character
rather than as the very human kindly
man he really was

  perhaps i am approaching my dotage
-i am nearing the century mark-and
perhaps i just imagine this to be so but
whether i am right or wrong about it
i feel that before i pass i must set
down the story of the great preserver of
our race

  of all men i ain best fitted for this
task for my memories of him and of his
work are stamped indelibly on my con-

sciousness by the great love i had and
still have for him

  as a great historical figure he lives in
the minds of all my desire is that
through my humble efforts he shall hence-
forth live in the hearts of all as benefac-
tor friend and true gentleman

  i have before me my own records
the earliest written in a very childish
hand and his own these latter con-
stitute my most valued possession and
when after my passing it becomes the
property of the nation it will be perhaps
the worlds most treasured document
the facts i can check from these records
the spirit of my beloved father robert
sanderson i may succeed in passing on
in some measure from the record writ-
ten in my heart

  perhaps we old ones are prejudiced
but to us that world of the old days was
more desirable and beautiful than this
of to-day you youngsters think this a
wonderful world and so it is in many
ways but then you have no memory

amazing stories

three days later into our atmosphere came a lont shining projectile shooting flamt and firt

from its nose
the white dwarf



a brilliant golden ball of fire five times
as big across five times as big even
though he was so far away picture to
yourselves the wondrous coloring of the
world bathed in this golden-white light
picture its beauty under the multi-col-
ored rays of dawn and sunset colors
never seen on earth to-day

  picture too the eerie magic beauty of
the world when faintly lit by the light
reflected from that lost satellite the
moon itself a fairy-like silvery disk of
charm and loveliness you cannot no
and we ourselves never valued that beauty
at its full worth until it was taken away
from us forever

  we were so sure that nothing would
change did not the astrologers tell us
that the sun would continue almost with-
out change for countless millions of
years were we not in a region of space
altogether free of any nebulosity which
might produce undesirable conditions
so we went on living in our fools par-
adise unheeding unwarned

  unwarned did i say that is not
quite true as far back as  a full
thirty years before the beginning of the
change we had the warning if we had
only realized it that wise old astron-
omer doctor jeans had told us of the
danger yet i doubt if even he took his
own words seriously here is the very
extract from his book

   jt is slightly disconcerting to find that our suns
position in the npertureluininoity diagram suggests
that it is pressing with perilous force against the dan-
gerous edge of the main sequence so that it-collapse
into a ieebly-luminous white dwarf may commence at
ny moment jeans astronomy s cosmogony

  little did he suspect that that change
must already have commenced in the
interior of the sun

the first note of alarm was sounded
by one of the astronomers at mount
wilson observatory for what season
he was re-examining the solar spectrum
we dont know but something or other
caused him to compare his new photo-

graphs with similar ones taken many
years before

  it is perhaps due to the keenness of
this unknown observers eyesight that we
to-day have our continued existence for
it was his detection of microscopic differ-
ences between the old and the new spcc-
tra that first told us the truth

  there was no doubt about it the sun
was changing its spectral type and as
cosmic changes go was changing with
incredible rapidity

  of course the news-sheets and the ra-
diocasts got hold of the story and of
course they garbled and twisted it as
usual the first news the world heard
about it was a six-inch scare headline in
san franciscos leading daily of july th
 in huge red letters the paper
screamed

 end of the world

the sun blowing up

  fortunately in this case no one took
the paper seriously we were all used
to that sort of thing oh yes people
bought the paper but most of them to
see what new hoax it was or to find out
what new product was setting out on an
advertising campaign

  instead of panicking the western
world treated it as a huge joke but not
for long the men at the telescopes soon
made it clear that this time there was
no hoax in very truth the sun was
changing but they assured us there was
nothing to worry about yet these
changes are matters of milleniums-
plenty of time for this generation to live
out its life and for its successors to be-
come adapted to the differences if any
that our earth would experience

  it was not until  that observations
were sufficiently numerous to tell the
whole story of the change during the
period prior to this astronomers had put
forward many theories some said that


amazing stories

the sun was about to expand into a
nova as the result of its own internal
pressure and prophesied a fiery death for
our world others said that internal
forces had at last become synchronized
and were causing a pulsation that would
cause the sun to split into a binary system
and assured us that the effect of this
upon the earth would not be serious a
third school insisted that though this
might eventually happen the only im-
mediate change was that possibly the sun
would gradually develop into a variable
star though not at all probably of the
cepheid type

  strangely enough no one suspected the
real truth until  when my father
who was even then a brilliant spectro-
scopist dropped the proverbial bomb-
shell the sun was commencing to
shrink into a white-dwarf star

  there was no doubt of it the rival
astronomers all eager for new light on
the phenomena re-examined their data
and calculations and one and all con-
firmed my fathers prophecy

  stilj the world felt no anxiety after
all it would be such a slow change that
only the astronomers would notice it
within a life time it was again a case of
apres nous le deluge

  i was only a small boy at the time-
ten years old to be exact-but i
can still remember him throwing down
his newspaper in disgust still see him
turn to his physicist friend jack tre-
mayne still hear his words

  what fools this isnt a matter of gen-
erations at all the suns unstable i tell
you the collapse has actually com-
menced and will continue with increasing
rapidity

  is it really as serious as that his
friend asked him youre not usually a
scaremonger bob but even coming from
you this is hard to believe

  listen jack my father told him
earnestly the position as i see it is this

our world is doomed to slow death from
freezing now shall i broadcast the
facts tell the people the ghastly truth or
let them die slowly and miserably hoping
on to the end that somehow they will yet
be saved

at this tremayne leaned forward in
his chair and stared intently at my
father

  you dont mean that do you bob
he asked is it really as bad as that

  im afraid it is according to my
figures the point of instability was
reached fifty years or so ago and some-
time between that time and this the suns
interior began to contract now the sur-
face layers are beginning to feel the ef-
fects of this internal strain and already
visible fluctuations are occurring

  within about sixty years our sun will
have become a star very much like the
little companion of sirius a feeble white
dwarfs true-its ccntral temperature
will still be enormous in fact it will
rise to millions of degrees but the heat
will not be able to radiate on account of
the terrific internal resistance the atoms
will be packed so closely and be so far
stripped of their electrons that they will
not be able to radiate freely you
know what i mean even if im not using
the physicists language

  according to my figures instead of
having an average density of sth that
of water as at present the sun will
contract until its density is about sixty-
thousand that of water-say a ton or so
to the cubic inch-which will give it a
diameter of considerably less than thirty-
thousand milec instead of its present nine-
hundred thousand miles

  this means a radiating surface of
about one thousandth the present area
and even though the surface will be
much hotter yet the total radiation will
not be much more than a third of one
percent of its present value in other
the white dwarf



words our sun will shrink to the level
of a star of the twelfth magnitude or
thereabouts

  theres no need to elaborate on the
effects of that is there 

  i guess its the end all right bob if
thats really the case tremayne was
forced to admit vet even in the face of
these definite figures he couldnt quite
believe that the end of the world had
really come

  is there no way out he asked pres-
ently

  father shook his head sadly

  no im afraid there isnt jack not
unless-

  unless what r

  oh nothing i just thought for a
moment that we might-but its utterly
impossible

  tremayne looked hard at my father

  whats that bob did i hear you
use the word impossible

  yes i know father answered i
know ive always bawled you out for
using it whenever i got a chance i
know ive always said that impossibilities
dont exist and yet now im forced to
eat my own words

  tremayne got up from his chair and
stood in front of his friend

  bob he said quietly im not lis-
tening to that frompu you dont be-
lieve its the end anymore than i do the
very fact that you thought of a possibility
proves that doesnt it

  i thought of that too father replied
but i know its useless to kid ourselves
-call it the optimism of youth if you
like and then remember that our sun is
dying of old age

  all right then bob i will call it the
optimism of youth now you listen put
it this way our sun isnt dying but
merely changing from one state to
another the old state has become un-
tenable therefore it must change to the
new one but why call it death why

not call it a re-birth and say the sun is
renewing its youth 

t rery pretty jack my father was

  v	still unconvinced but im afraid
its not very practical the sun may go
on living for many more millions of
years but such a sun cannot give much
light and heat to the poor old earth no
jack its the end for us whichever way
you look at it

  snap out of it bob tremayne still
persisted in his efforts i havent fin-
ished yet you can bombard me with
all the pessimistic facts you can find but
i still wont give up hope as you say
it may be the optimism of youth-were
neither of us much over thirty yet-but
youths optimism has generally got us
further than ages pessimism

  come on now lets hear this idea
how ever impossible it sounds

  all right jack if you must have it
what i started to say was this

   there isnt any way unless we can
move the earth closer to the sun-now
chew on that for a while and see if youll
talk any more about going on hoping

  i dont need to chew on it at all why
should it be so impossible to do that
you a physicist ask that father
laughed pray tell me good sir against
what shall we push in order to drive the
earth out of its present orbit

  tremayne shrugged his shoulders

  i dont know he admitted ill
agree that it looks crazy but in any case
a little experimental figuring wont hurt
anyone and itll be an interesting little
problem to tackle at the least

  all right then father was naturally
optimistic and jack tremaynes argu-
ments had served to chase away the cloud
of hopelessness its a go come and
have dinner here to-day week and well
compare notes and see which of us is
right

  i shall always remember that dinner


amazing stories

perhaps it was the undercurrent of ex-
citement that prevailed or perhaps it was
that in the discussion which followed the
meal i was forgotten and so was al-
lowed to sit up till long after my usual
bedtime whatever the reason i have
always retained a dear picture of that
night

  during dinner neither uncle jack as
i used to call him nor my father spoke
of the big problem but as soon as they
had settled down before the fire father
went right to the point

  well jack what about it he asked
no luck im afraid bob uncle
jack hated to make the admission im
sure its going to take almost unlim-
ited power to move this old earth you
were right last week when you reminded
me that weve nothing to push against
then father who had been struggling
hard to hide his elation fired his first
broadside

  so the optimist and the pessimist have
changed places have they 

  changed places how come asked
uncle jack knowing that something un-
expected was coming

  sure im the optimist this time
ever heard of a rocket 

  and i thought you had an idea
scoffed uncle jack as he sat back with a
mock sigh sure ive heard of rockets
didnt we nearly blow ourselves up with
em when we were kids but as for
shifting the world with em-nothing do-
ing why they cant even make a decent
rocket motor to drive an aeroplane

at that i spent a couple of days figur-
ing on the darned things-just in case
well father queried mischievously
and the answer to that calculation
was 

  the same as you got i reckon not
enough power available on the earth to
get even a thousandth part of the reaction
needed

  sure jack thats what i got too-

at first

  what dyou mean at first tre-
mayne almost shouted it he knew how
that there was something coming

  just what i say it looked just fool-
ish at first but i either had to solve
the problem or spend the rest of my life
listening to your feeble jibes and alleged
wit he grinned so i got busy and did
some more figuring on new sources of
power

  and you found one

  found one  no you found it 

  i found it what the devil are you
talking about

  uncle jacl-really was surprised this
time

  the great physicist fails to apply his
own discoveries to the solution of prac-
tical problems jeered father as tre-
mayne became more mystified than ever

  your- he began to explain but

unde jack stopped him with

  my atom-buster well of all the
dumbells

   atom-buster thats good laughed
father  quite thought youd figure
that in somewhere being the discoverer
of it and all that but just in case you
didnt i did listen

  your machine develops power by con-
verting mass into radiation and from
what ive seen of it it appears to have a
fairly high efficiency then why not use
it to devdop beams whose radiation-
pressure will be directed outward from
the earth wont the reaction of such
beams give a rocket effect and force the
earth in the opposite direction
hm-m-m i suppose so but even
so it doesnt seem possible to produce
such terrific beams as we should need-
theyll be extremely ineffident too

  at a guess id be inclined to say that
wed have to disintegrate so much matter
that that in itself would wreck the earth
the white dwarf



then too think of the atmospheric dis-
turbances they alone would be suffi-
cient to kill us all off

  its too bad bob but i guess its not
practical

  it isnt eh father got up went
across to his desk and took out a file of
papers well just look those over will
you you old sceptic

  tremayne took the papers and for
nearly half an hour he studied them in si-
lence after which the discussion started
again

  look here bob he opened up
these figures are a very well but why
wreck the earth to save it

  not going to wreck anything why
should i father challenged

  you wont eh well look

  i rather suspect that tremayne was
already convinced but he and father
often used to adopt this antithetical man-
ner just to bring out the weak points in
an argument

  according to these figures you plan to
use the annihilation of matter produced
by my short-wave ray machine to pro-
duce a beam of radiation whose re-
action will speed the earth in its orbit
and at the same time drive it towards the
sun until it is finally forced into a new
orbit a little kshian ire-million miles
from it that right r

  yes thats about it jack and why
not

  according to your own figures you
will require about  -
 horse power what about
atmospheric disturbances when you start
up a beam like that why ionization

alone-

  yes i know jack its going to
mean terrific storms and unprecedented
electrical disturbances but thats inev-
itable we can minimize this by getting
to as high an altitude as possible to start
our beams-well have to anyway be-
cause we dont want to have any more

  atmosphere in the path of our beam than
we are forced to

  what do you mean our beams
youre talking as though it was all ar-
ranged

   know i am jack its going to be
 heres no other possible way so you and
i arc going to get this thing started-
force it on the world if we have to

ob youre crazy uncle jacks
expression of delighted admiration
entirely belied his words suppose we
grant you that bit about the atmosphere
whats going to happen when you start
shoving on the earth with such a pres-
sure youll split it in two

  no we shant well place our beams
on mountain tops of high plateaux where
the crust is strong enough to stand the
push then too we dont pull all the
power in one beam-couldnt handle it
anyway-but use several hundred to dis-
tribute the strain

  well sounds possible uncle jack ad-
mitted but theres still the great ob-
jection that when you bring a planet very
close to its primary sun the tidal strains
will tend to smash it into fragments like
the rings of saturn

  sure if we get close enough father
agreed but if youd only learn a bit of
astronomical mechanics youd know that
a planet is safe if its three or four times
the suns radius away unless there is a
great difference in their relative den-
sities in our case we shall be several
hundred diameters distant since the sun
will have shrunk to about  miles
across so well be quite safe even when
we consider the great density of the
contracted sun

   but how about the daily rotation

   for two bodies of siiaiur density the small body
will be broken up s soon k the radius of its orbit be-
comes less than j times the radius of the large body
if the iroaller body is less dense than the larger tfie
distance ie incrrawd correspondingly this figure is
known as roches limit


amazing stories

tides seasonal variations and things of
that sort bob

  theyll be darned funny to get used
to at first for some of them are going to
be altogether different but well have
fifty years or so to get used to them itll
take that long for the sun to contract and
our speed of approach must be calculated
to conform to that otherwise well either
fry or freeze at some point on the way
itll be considerably disconcerting at
that for we cant possibly adjust the
changes in our orbit to allow for the
fluctuations that the sun will ncccssar-
ily undergo still i dont think itll be too
bad if we keep approaching at about the
speed required to keep the earths average
temperature somewhere about where it
is now

  of course conditions will be vastly
different but man is an adaptable crea-
ture lets see how it sounds

  we can keep the daily rotation con-
stant by directing our rays accordingly
we get rid of seasonal changes altogether
by forcing the earths axis more normal
to the plane of the ecliptic the short
year of about four and a half days wont
bother us in the least for we shall not
notice it except by observing the stellar
movements the increased velocity of
the earth will be as undetectable as is our
present speed wc shant feel a steady
speed of eighty-three miles a second any
more than we can feel the nineteen-miles
a second we are now doing

  no doubt there will be considerable
discomfort and disturbance even proba-
bly some actual suffering during the
periods of acceleration but thats un-
avoidable and it is certainly less unpleas-
ant than slowly freezing to death

  the high tidesll be a bit of a nuis-
ance i must admit and theyll spoil a lot
of good country but theyll still be en-
durable say four-to six-hundred feet on
most coasts he paused for a moment
then continued seriously its going to

  be a tough journey right enough i can see
that but needs must when the devil
drives you know jack

  i suppose so check over those fig-
ures again thanks now lets see you
figure a group of rays developing about
 horsepower will give you sufficient
push to give an acceleration of half a
centimeter per second per second-hm-
m-m that shouldnt jar things too bad-
ly but itll get us up to eighty-three miles
a second in a lot less than fifty years
wont it

ure it will but you dont suppose
we can use continuous raying do
you i figure that v we use them for
about ten minutes at a stretch well cause
enough fun dont forget well have the
atmosphere as well as the oceans trying
to lag behind that means terrific wind
storms and bad tides a ten minute push
means an interval of some hours to let
the atmosphere re-adjust itself

  two banks of rays one on each side
of the earth operating alternately should
give the minimum of trouble and ten
minutes every twelve hours will give us
plenty of time

  tremayne studied the figures a bit
longer then he shot some more ques-
tions

  see here bob youve figured that the
total acceleration required sixty-four
miles a second or say ten million centi-
metres a second will be given by an
amount of energy equal to the total de-
struction of thirty-million tons of mat-
ter then why on earth do you go on
calculating on a basis of a thousand times
that

  wliy not  do you expect our rays to
be a hundred per cent efficient if we
get a tenth of one per cent efficiency out
of them well lie darned lucky shant
we

  yes thats true but now heres anoth-
er trouble if we accelerate the earth
the white dwarf



wont fall towards the sun itll tend to
fly off at a tangent to its present orbit and
it will eventually land up away further
from the sun instead of nearer

  it would if we merely shoved it along
faster but if we shoot the rays outward
we can so direct them as to drive the
earth towards the sun as well as speeding
it up-just a matter of careful calcula-
tion that

  how about the moon bob was the
next question

  dont need it do we well sort of
miss her old face for a while i guess
but we cant afford to take her along with
us besides we can take the first pushes
against her until she gets driven too far
away say a couple of million miles well

  the non-scientifieally minded will no dcubt prefer
the story without too much mathematics but for those
who are interested in that side of things we append the
following outline of the figures that my lather first
showed to uncle jack

  the suns present state is that of a g type star ol

	miles diameter and surface temperature about
 c its absolute magnitude is about  and it
mass about  x r tens a star of this mass and size
is just on the border-line of the main sequence and
in the case of our sun has recently become unstable
and has started to collapse to the next stable configura-
tion that of a  white dwarf

  the shrinkage will lake about sixty years more the
final state of the sun bcin that of the star known as
sirius  it will have a diameter of only  miles
with a surface temperature approaching  c and
a central temperature almost beyond estimation say a
billion degrees its density will be increased to about

	times its present value on the average say about
a ton to the cubic inch

  its total radiation will decrease in the ratio of about

i to  making it a star of about the th magni-
tude the visihle light radiation will he a little greater
than this the heat radiation being correspondingly less

  in order that the earth may receive the same amount
of beat from the sun as it now does we must move to
an crbit of less than five million miles radius this
can only be done by increasing the oibital speed from

its present  miles a second to about  miles a second
which will give an orbital period of about  days so
that the term year will become almost meaningless

  to accelerate the earths mass  x s tons to this
speed requires at leas x ergs of energy and this
is greater than the total energy available on the earth
unless we release vast stores of energy by the annihi-
lation of part of the earths substance

 the annihilation of one gram of matter releases
  x  ergs which gives u a figure somewhere around

 x  grams to be annihilated-say about  million
tons

  estimating the reaction from the energy release-the
radiation-pressure-at one tenth of one percent of the
energy release we require  x  tons or say from i

to v a cubic mile

  the reaction from this energy should give accelera-
tion of ii cm sec which will give the total speed
required is about two million seconds tais divided
over  years gives roughly  minutes per day

  two stations on opposite sides of the earth say the
andes and the himalayas radiating for ten minutes
per day should leave enough margin for all ordinary
contingencies

  these stations must consist of matter annihilators
or atom-busters to use the popular term capable of
consuming and converting into energy a total of about
 tons a second

save all kinds of power by pushing

against her

  and so the discussion went on all eve-
ning and far on into die night until at
last uncle jack was fully satisfied

  as he rose to go he said

  its a wonderful scheme bob and
im right with you how soon do we
start 

  if were lucky well get the people
convinced within a year or a couple of
years maybe theyll very soon be
noticinga change in conditions that will
do more than all our arguments

then say ten years for preparation
and another fifty years for the long ride

  say jack well be old men before
we get there maybe well not see the
end of the trip at all

  likely not bob uncle jack agreed
bat even if we dont young ted here
putting a hand on my shoulder as i
got up rather sleepily will be able to
finish the job for us

  good-night old man see you up at
the observatory sometime to-morrow

a month or so later after consulta-
tion and discussion with the leading
scientists and statesmen of the world my
father issued a statement through all the
main news agencies

  various contradictory rumors as to
the important changes now occurring in
the structure of the sun have been cir-
culated during the past two years these
rumors have been vague and often ill-
expressed by uninformed persons and
have led to the whole matter being
treated as a joke

  it is therefore neccssary to inform the
peoples of the earth of the true state of
affairs

  let us assure you first of all that there
is no cause for panic although it essen-
tial that world prepare for a time of in-
tense disturbance calling for great cour-
age and self-sacrifice on the part of
everyone


amazing stories

  we cannot stress too much the serious-
ness of the condition in which wc find
ourselves and cannot urge too strongly
our plea for immediate and united action
by all peoples

  briefly the situation is as follows

  our sun is collapsing into the type of
star known as a white dwarf the col-
lapse will occupy about sixty years at
the end of which time it will give only
about one-four-hundredth of its present
light and heat

  this would mean total annihilation for
the human race-a slow death by freez-
ing-except that we have discovered a
possible means of averting the tragedy

  we have refrained from publishing the
facts until wc could offer some hope of
safety because we did not wish to cause
needless worry and suffering but now
that we have a solution to offer there is
no further reason for hiding the truth

  our only hope of salvation is to move
the earth itself closer to the sun and this
can only be done at a tremendous cost and
sacrifice

  during the next two weeks more de-
tails will be given you and the probable
effects of such an attempt explained at
the end of that time each government will
conduct a plebiscite to determine the
wishes of its people

  we strongly urge you one and all to
vote yes to the question shall we
make the attempt to move the world  for
it is our only hope of continued existence
as a race

  this statement is issued with the ap-
proval of all governments and of all
prominent scientific bodies

robert sanderson dsc frs

john s tremayne msc phd

on behalf of the royal society

  in spite of carefully written explana-
tions and appeals the plebiscite returned
an overwhelming no to the proposi-
tion the worlds attitude in general
was

  weve been hoaxed before we dont
intend to be fooled this time

   still in spite of this the scientists con-
tinued their preparations my father and
jack tremayne being tacitly accepted as

leaders in the enterprise even by the
older and more experienced men

  six months later a second plebiscite was
conducted by this time the effects of
the suns instability had become a little
more noticeable it no longer shone
with quite so steady a light variations
in its radiations were becoming detect-
able though faintly so without the use
of instruments and as a result weather
conditions all over the world were show-
ing great irregularities

  the world as a whole was not yet con-
vinced however and this second vote
confirmed the result of the former one-
but with a greatly decreased majority

  evidently some of the people were be-
ginning to wonder

  the attitude of the various religious
bodies was typical the buddhist
churches folded their hands and talked
of the end of a cycle the moham-
medan dismissed it in one sentence as
the will of allah the more conser-
vative of the christian churches at first
denounced the advocates of the plan as
blasphemous but later on changed to an
attitude of bitter scoffing only a few
of the more progressive organizations
saw in it a reasonable proposition one or
two even going so far as to point out
that the discovery had been made in
time to allow humanity to work out its
own salvation

- i v-r -

duing the next six months it be-
came obvious to all those who were
reasonably observant that there certainly
was something happening to the sun
they could no longer ignore the fluctua-
tions now discernible in its brilliancy and
also in its apparent size

  the result was that the third vote
showed about fifty-two per cent against
the attempt and by the end of the next
period human thought had swung around
so far that a three-fourths majority
voted a definite yes
the white dwarf



  once the peoples mandate had gone
forth no time was wasted preparations
must be commenced immediately for the
suns shrinkage was proceeding even
more rapidly than had been anticipated
if the attempt to save the world was to
be made in time it must be started with-
in seven years at the least

  for oncc in history the world acted as
a unit only one of the greater powers
showed signs of giving trouble and this
one was speedily brought into line by
pressure from within as well as from the
rest of the nations

  to us of the old days the task seemed
overwhelmingly colossal even many
of the leaders looked on it as a forlorn
hope in fact one astronomer actually
expressed the opinion that at any rate it
will be better to die quickly rather than
to live on to face slow starvation and
freezing

  there was much discussion as to the
exact placcs for setdng up the atom-
busters everyone scientists and all
had now adopted tremaynes humorous
name for his disintegrators but in the
end they agreed on two areas in which
die districts originally selected by my
father an area in the andes not far from
lake titicaca and another in the north-
east of upper burma to the east of the
himalayas these two regions included
a number of suitable plateaux well above
the fifteen-thousand foot level and they
were almost exactly opposite to each
other on the earths surface

  at first points right on the equator
were advocated by many but they were
finally rejected as giving the rays no
thrust in a direction diat would serve to
swing the earths axis perpendicular to
the plane of the ecliptic

  the task of preparation was indeed co-
lossal a vast army of workmen was
shipped to each of the chosen spots or
rather as near to them as was possible
for before anything else could be done

roads and railways had to be built to
transport the mass of equipment needed

  during the three years that were occu-
pied in this road construction the worlds
largest factories were put to work fash-
ioning the necessary parts for the atom-
busters

  a great deal of experimentation had
been necessary before a satisfactory ma-
chine was evolved the first ones con-
structed were far too inefficient and small
but when they began to build bigger ones
they came up against troubles produced
by die enormous forces and temperatures
generated

  the first serious accident occurred in
 father had designed a machine
big enough to project a ten-foot beam of
force this machine used up fifty pounds
or so of matter each second and was in-
tended as an experimental model for the
big three-ton-a-second machines that were
eventually to be constructed

  they all tiiought die trial would be a
huge success and in their unwise en-
thusiasm the factory authorities had ar-
ranged for a number of visitors to wit-
ness the tests

  about four oclock one afternoon the
big machine already set up in an open
space a hundred yards from the visitors
seats was loaded with its first charges
of crushed rock

  the mechanism consisted of a small
projector of rays of extremely short
wave length rays short and penetrative
enough to destroy the actual protons and
electrons of matter

this activating ray started the dis-
integration of the matter in the main
projector and the similar radiation pro-
duced from this in turn activated the rest
of the charge in a cumulative manner

   i atn not physicist enough to explain exactly how
treraayne produced these rays although i understand
it to some extent they were rays of shorter wave
length than the milliian or cosmic rays that
caused so much excitement at one time their wave
length being of the order of km era


amazing stories

the intensity of the power developed be-
ing limited only by the speed at which the
charge was fed into the focus of the ma-
chine

  the energy thus set free was focussed
into a beam pointed in the required di-
rection by means of extremely refractory
reflecting surfaces it was the produc-
tion of these reflectors that had first made
possible the original atom-buster no
other known substance being able to with-
stand the terrific bombardment of the
rays for a single instant

  in the machine under test these re-
flectors were six feet thick and were cal-
culated to be opaque to the penetration
of rays of the intensity to be produced

  even these reflectors suffered consid-
erable surface volatilization so that two
minutes was set at the time limit for
projection

  the demonstration was to begin at 
p m and at that time the factory super-
intendent from his seat among the guests
threw on the activating beam

  there was a terrific crackling roar as
the beam shot out into the sky the
beam itself was of coursc invisible but
its path was marked by an intensely daz-
zling beam of light as the molecules of
air in its path became ionized or rather
as the atoms themselves were stripped al-
most to their nuclei blazing particles
of gas the atoms torn off but not actually
annihilated by the beam streamed out
into space in a fountain of living fire
the heat and electrical tension became
unbearable terrific lightning flashes
played around the beam and a wind be-
gan to blow towards the streaming fount
of radiance

  the sight was utterly terrifying but
unutterably grand and impressive

  for forty seconds the superintendent
stood motionless except for the move-
ments of his fingers on the feed controls
then uncle jack who was standing be-
tween him and me shouted above the

deafening din of the reverberating ma-
chine

  cut it out cut it out for gods
sake

  the shout was drowned in the ear-
splitting noise desperately he tried to
make die superintendent hear but with-
out avail then realizing the futility of
what he was doing he grabbed the mans
hands from the switches and in an agony
of apprehension slammed everything
into neutral

  but it was too late the reflectors had
already becomc too thin even as the
ray died down from lack of fuel the
whole machine exploded with terrific
violence scattering blazing pieces of it-
self in all directions

  had the machine burst while radiating
at full blast the result would have been
something indescribable perhaps even the
uncontrolled disintegration of the earth
itself although the general opinion was
that such a catastrophe is impossible

  even as it was the shock was felt for
miles of the group of spectators six
were killed outright while all were more
or less severely injured by the concussion
and the flying fragments the super-
intendent was among the killed but
strangely enough uncle jack and i both
escaped with very minor injuries and
burns

  i suppose a few such accidents were
humanly unavoidable but i know that
this one impressed me so deeply that for
weeks i begged my father to give up his
plan and let the world die out in peace
after all

  it may have been the shock that af-
fected me in this way i think likely for
i snapped out of this phase as suddenly
as i was jarred into it and once more i
became as enthusiastic a helper as any-
one

  perhaps this little tragedy was not al-
together to be regretted for out of it
eventually came much good for months
the white dwarf



after it both father and uncle jack
worked continuously on the production of
a still more rcfractory substance for the
reflectors i too working with them and
learning all i could so that i could con-
tinue the work when their time came to
lay it down

we did succeed at last our success
being without any doubt due to the
magnificent courage confidence and faith
of these two wonderful men never once
during this period nor at any other time
for that matter did either of them lose
faith in their ultimate success never did
they let down on their activity unless such
a let-down could be indulged in without
delaying the work being human they
sometimes became irritable but notwith-
standing this they usually kept a calm
and kindly manner that endeared them
to every one who worked with them

  we call these men great because of
what they accomplished in devising and
working out die plan but i tell you that
their real greatness lay not in that but in
their fine character in their unshaken
confidence that inspired a world in the
greatness of their love for humanity that
enabled them to save a world not only
from destruction by that terrible freezing
death but from the horrors of fear and
panic from the effects of those waves of
terror that seemed at times to sweep the
whole world

  very human were these two men i
have seen my father stop an experiment
to tend to a workman who had burned a
hand there were others to do it but
the burn had been caused by an unavoid-
able slip on my fathers part and so he
felt it was up to him to make personal
amends to the unfortunate victim

  by the middle of  the banks of
huge machines were almost ready to use
in each district a number of moderately
flat areas totalling some hundreds of
square miles had been found in the high-

er ranges that in the andes being well
over the seventeen-thousand feet line and
the other less than a thousand feet lower
in each of these were set up four separate
tanks of atom-busters each consisting
of some five-hundred huge projectors
each capable of annihilating over three
tons of matter a second and giving a
sixty-foot beam of almost incalculable
force

  these projectors could be adjusted to
turn the beams through an angle of two
degrees from the central point which
was cxactly vertical further swinging
would mean danger of forcing the whole
apparatus over while less gave insuffi-
cient movement for aiming

  a discharge consisted of a ten-minute
period of radiation from one bank of
projectors which would then be allowed
to cool for three days while others were
used after each discharge new reflec-
tors had to be installed and it was the
construction and transportation of these
uncounted millions of reflcctors that had
been the worlds greatest difficulty

  september th  at ten oclock at
night local sun-time was the time set
for the first discharge from the andean
station the other station to follow with
its discharge after approximately twelve
hours the time  p m was decided
on after a great deal of calculation as
giving the push which would give best re-
sults in both speeding the earth around
the sun and driving it in towards the cen-
ter the course aimed at was naturally
a gradually tightening spiral

  the first half-dozen discharges from
the andes were to be directed against the
moon as it was then in a suitable position
and the reaction against it would it was
hoped increase the push on the earth
considerably that was of course the
chief reason for selecting that particular
date for starting the raying the moon
being then very close to the full

  remote control was installed to all the


amazing stories

machines for anyone within a mile of
any one of the big projectors would be
pretty sure to come to a sudden and fiery
end as soon as the ray was formed the
walls of protective screens efficient as
they were were quite inadequate to check
the whole of the unfocussed part of the
radiation and exposure to these short
hard waves meant instant death even in
comparatively low intensities

  as the momentous hour approached
father sat motionless and silent his hand
on the control switches

  slowly the seconds ticked by the
company of watchers scarcely breathed
so intense was the strain

just as the tension had become ut-
terly unendurable father moved the
first switch for a few seconds there
was no sign of action then came a dull
reverberating roar as the first ten ma-
chines went into action

  one after another the switches went
over moment by moment the reverbera-
tion increased until at the end of a min-
ute or so the whole earth seemed one
chaos of infinite sound and infinite vi-
bration away into the skies stretched
beam on beam of fearful radiance beams
of marvelous beauty haloed with light-
nings such as old father jupiter him-
self never dreamed of

  was there a sense of motion some
of us fancied we could detect it but none
of us were sure

  six observers including uncle jack
sat with eyes glued to the telescopes
watching the changeless face of the full
moon a moon whose brilliance was com-
pletely overshadowed by the dazzling
beams of power

  an interminable five minutes passed
the earth itself seemed almost riven
apart yet still that infinity of reverbe-
rating energy continued to flame forth

  one of the observers called suddenly

his voice coming shrill and clear through
the awful din

  were moving i think sir 

  instantly father leaped to the lads
telescope checked its bearings and the
observers figures for another minute
he sat there motionless then with a very
proud yet extremely humble movement
he rose and seemingly without any effort
he called above the din

  we arc moving our world is on its
way to safety and he added a very fer-
vent thank god 

  a few moments later he reached out
and commenced to throw over switches
the rays dying out as he did so at first
the silence seemed even more terrifying
than the reverberation then the tense
emotions burst their bounds and for a
while we shouted and capered around like
little children just out of school-all ex-
cept father and uncle jack who stood
silent with clasped hands

  our earth was at last started on its
strange and wondrous adventure

  calculation showed that the push of
the ray was rather more than had been
expected but even so the period of radia-
tion was not shortened it was felt that
it would be best to get ahead of sched-
ule and then cease raying now and then
for a period to let the world steady it-
self

  for a month the regular schedule was
carried out the effect of the alternate push
from north and south of the equator
having exactly the desired effect of push-
ing the earths axis over slowly to its
new direction

  at the end of this month the atmos-
phere and he oceans were so disturbed
that it was necessary to stop raying for
some ten days the storms having be-
come so violent that serious damage was
resulting

  this procedure-a months activity fol-
lowed by ten days rest-was followed
for nearly four years with hardly any
the white dwarf



variation by the end of that time wc
were running in an orbit almost identical
with that of venus

  about this time i was one night ob-
serving for father when i thought i saw
a flash of light from the dark side of
that planet which being just then quite
close to us was a most magnificent sight
far surpassing the glory of our old moon
now lost to us forever

  i called father and together we
watched there was no mistake about it
five separate and distinct flashes each
lasting about forty seconds were ob-
served

  what do you make of it dad i
asked him

  there can be only one explanation-
signals he replied without hesitation

but he was wrong it was more
than signals three days later into
our atmosphere camc a long shining proj-
ectile shooting flame and fire from its
nose and within a few minutes came
another-and another-until five of them
were whistling through the air checking
their speed with their fire-tubes as they
came

  before they landed they cruised over
a great part of the earth surface com-
ing to rest finally close to the great
yerkes observatory

   since it was by no means certain
whether these venerians were friendly or
not they were met by the entire staff of
the observatory all armed but these pre-
cautions proved entirely superfluous since
the visitors were here on a peaceful mis-
sion

  to-day we were familiar with the ap-
pearance of the venerians but these first
arrivals seemed very strange and bizarre
with their many limbs and their curious
translucent bodies

  they stayed with us for nearly three
months before we could converse with
them sufficiently fluently to give them the

information they had come for it seems
that they too had suspccted something
wrong with the sun but they could not
make out what the trouble was since
their cloud-girt world made observation
difficult by a lucky chancc they had seen
our world approaching their own and
had been able to guess by noticing its
irregular orbit that it was being driven
from its old path by intelligent beings
they had therefore made a great effort
and had so much improved their reaction-
motors that they were able to send five
space ships across space to us to inquire
what it was all about

  it has always seemed curious to me
that the venerians who in many ways
are so far behind us should as the result
of our efforts in moving our own world
perfect the very thing that we ourselves
had failed to develop satisfactorily-the
rocket-ship

  as soon as the venerians fully under-
stood the state of affairs they returned to
their own world saying as they left

  now that we know that you of earth
are no more hostile to us than we are to
you perhaps we shall be able to develop
an intercourse profitable to us both

  at the present moment we both have
greater problems to attend to so that
must wait but not for very long we
feel

  we can never be grateful enough to
you for giving us the secret of your pro-
jection machines before long we shall
be following you for we too must perish
otherwise

  the rest of the journey was without in-
terest we never seemed to get accus-
tomed to the reverberation of the atom-
busters nor to the violent storms that
swept the earth almost continuously we
hated them but we tolerated them because
we coidd not do otherwise consoling our-
selves with the thought that some day
they would no longer be necessary


amazing stories

  there was no dramatic climax to our
journey we just rode into our new
orbit and then ceased to ray any more
no doubt it would have made better read-
ing if i could have described a magnifi-
cent climax but certainly no one on the
earth desired any such finish we were
all so heartily sick of the continuous
racket that all we wanted was the chance
to settle down peacefully once more

  the gradual development of the huge
tides with the consequent inundation of
large areas of fertile land and of most
of the great cities came about so grad-
ually that we had plenty of time to get
used to them and to change our intra-
continental traffic from ocean-going to
air-going the increased volcanic action
troubled us but little since most of the
action was directed through the old vol-
canoes most of which were far from the
populated districts

  the gradual change in the condition
and types of plant growth was extremely
interesting and on the whole beneficial
the increasing preponderance of the
shorter waves in the suns light produced
not only greater fertility but more beau-
tiful forms

the only noticeable effect on our
bodies was as you are all aware to
darken our skins so that to-day we are
all permanently sun-tanned as we
should have called it in the old days our
eyes too have changed a little due to
the difference in the quality and intensity
of the daylight

  our seasonless year of four and a half

days still seems strange to us who knew
the old fascinating seasonal changes
though to you children of the new gen-
eration it is normal enough especially
since we still keep the old period of three
hundred and sixty-five days as our legal
year

  for a while too we missed the moon-
light but now that venus has come here
too we have a light that even i must
admit is better than the old one

  the old venerian who first thought of
bringing the two planets together into a
binary system was a real benefactor to
both worlds

  my father and his friend lived to see
the successful completion of their task
in fact it seems almost as though they
just lived on for that for both of them
passed within a few months of the stabil-
ization of our new orbit

  and now i too am an old old man
ready to pass into the great beyond i
have been blessed above all men for to
me has been given the privilege of living
through the whole of this wonderful era
and of being closer than any other to that
man of all men my beloved father doc-
tor robert sanderson

  my lifes wurk is ended the story is
told as i would have you know it my
dear wife has already preceded me and
now i am ready to go myself confident in
the knowledge that man will go forward
and rise to undreamed-of heights in this
new-old world that despite all the trou-
bles and difficulties has been to me a very
good world to live in

on the banks of the orange river

on the th of january 
two men lay stretched at the
foot of an immense weeping
willow chatting and at the
same time watching most
attentively the waters of the orange
river this river the groote of the
dutch and the gariep of the hotten-
tots may well vie with the other three
great arteries of africa-the nile the
niger and the zambesi like those
it has its periodical risings its rapids
and cataracts travelers whose names
are known over part of its course
thompson alexander and burchell
have each in their turn praised the
clearness of its waters and the beauty
of its shores

  at this point the river as it ap-
proached the duke of york mountains
offered a magnificent spectacle to the
view insurmountable rocks imposing
masses of stone and trunks of trees that
had become mineralized by the action of
the weather deep caverns impenetrable
forests not yet disturbed by the set-
tlers ax all these shut in by back-
ground formed by the mountains of the
gariep made up a scene matchless in
its magnificence there too the waters
of the river on account of the extreme
narrowness of their bed and the sud-
den falling away of the soil rushed

down from a height of  feet above
the fall there were only surging sheets
of water broken here and there by
points of rock wreathed with green
boughs below there was only a dark
whirlpool of tumultuous waters crowned
with a thick cloud of damp vapor and
striped with all the colors of the rain-
bow from this gulf there arose a deaf-
ening roar increased and varied by the
echoes of the valley of these two men
who had evidently been brought into this
part of south africa by the chances of
an exploration one lent only a vague at-
tention to the beauties of nature that
were opened to his view this indiffer-
ent traveler was a hunting bushman a
fine type of that brave bright-eyed rap-
idly-gesticulating race of men who lead
a wandering life in the woods bush-
man a word derived from the dutch
bochjesman is literally a man of the
bushes and is applied to the wander-
ing tribes that scour the country to the
northwest of cape colony not a fam-
ily of these bushmen is sedentary they
pass their lives in roaming over the re-
gion lying between the orange river
and the mountains of the east in pil-
laging farms and in destroying the
crops of the overbearing colonists by
whom they have been driven back to-
wards the interior of the country where
more rocks than plants abound

  this bushman a man of about forty
years of age was very tall and evidently
possessed great muscular strength for


amazing stories

at last the vessel was in sight and william emery and his companion
were seen by those on board
measuring a meridian



even when at rest his body presented the
attitude of action the clearness ease
and freedom of his movements stamped
him as an energetic character a man
cast in the same mold as the celebrated
leather-stocking the hero of the
canadian prairies though perhaps pos-
sessing less calmness than coopers fa-
vorite hunter as could be seen by the
transient deeping of color in his face
whenever he was animated by any un-
usual emotion

  the bushman was no longer a savage
like the rest of his race the ancient
laquas for born of an english father
and a hottentot mother the half-breed
through his association with strangers
had gained more than he had lost and
spoke the paternal tongue fluently his
costume half-hottentot half-european
consisted of a red flannel shirt a loose
coat and breeches of antelope hide and
leggings made of the skin of a wild cat
from his neck hung a little bag con-
taining a knife a pipe and some tobac-
co he wore on his head a kind of skull-
cap of sheep-skin a belt made from the
thick thong of some wild animal en-
circled his waist and on his naked
wrists were rings of ivory wrought
with remarkable skill from his shoul-
ders flowed a kross a kind of hanging
mantle cut out of a tigers skin and
falling as low as the knees a dog of
native breed was sleeping near him
while he himself was smoking a bone
pipe in quick puffs giving unequivocal
signs of impatience

  come lets be calm mokoum said
his interlocutor you are truly the
most impatient of mortals whenever you
are not hunting but do understand my
worthy companion that we cant change
what is those whom we are expecting
will come sooner or later-to-morrow if
not to-day

 the bushmans companion was a
young man from twenty-five to twenty-

six years of age and quite a con-
trast to him his calm temperament
was shown in every action and it could
be decided without a moments hesita-
tion that he was an englishman his
much too homely costume proved him
to be unaccustomed to traveling he
gave one the idea of a clerk who had
wandered into a savage country and
one looked involuntarily to see if he
carried a pen behind his ear like a
cashier clerk accountant or some other
variety of the great family of the
bureaucracy

  in truth this young man was not a
traveler but a distinguished savant wil-
liam emery an astronomer attached to
the observatory at the cape-a useful
establishment which has for a long time
rendered true service to science

  the scholar rather out of his ele-
ment perhaps in this uninhabited re-
gion of south africa several hundred
miles from cape town could hardly
manage to curb the impatience of his
companion

  mr emery replied the hunter in
good english here we have been for
eight days at the place appointed on the
orange the cataract of morgheda it
is indeed a long time since it has be-
fallen a member of my family to re-
main eight days in one place you forget
that we are rovers and that our feet
burn at lingering

  my friend mokoum replied the
astronomer those we are wailing for
are coming from england and surely we
can allow them eight days of grace we
must take into account the length of the
passage and the hindrances which a
steam vessel must meet with in ascending
the orange and in short the thousand
difficulties belonging to such an under-
taking we have been told to make
every preparation for a journey of ex-
ploration in south africa and that
being done to come here to the falls of


amazing stories

morgheda and wait for my colleague
colonel everest of the cambridge
observatory well here are the falls
of morgheda we are at the place ap-
pointed and we are waiting what more
do you want my worthy bushman
the hunter doubtless did want more
for his fingers played feverishly with the
lock of his rifle an excellent manton
a weapon of precision with conical shot
which could bring down a wild cat or an
antelope at a distance of eight or nine
hundred yards thus it may be seen
that the hushman had put aside the
quiver of arrows and the poisoned darts
of his fellow countrv-men for the use of
european weapons

  but are you not mistaken mr em-
ery replied mokoum it is really at
the falls of morgheda and toward the
end of this month of january that they
have appointed to meet you

  yes my friend quietly - answered
william emery and here is the let-
ter from mr airy the director of the
greenwich observatory which will show
you that i am not mistaken

  the bushman took the letter that his
companion gave him he turned it
over and over like a man not very fam-
iliar with the mysteries of penmanship
then giving it back to william emery
he said tell me again what the blotted
piece of paper says

  the young astronomer endowed with
a patience proof against everything be-
gan again for the twentieth time the
story he had so often told to his friend
the hunter at the end of the foregoing
year william emery had received a
letter telling him of the approaching ar-
rival of colonel everest and an inter-
national scientific commission in south-
ern africa what the plans of the com-
mission were and why it came to the
extremity of the continent of africa
emery could not say mr airys letter
being silent on that point but following

the instructions that he had received he
hastened to lattakoo one of the most
northern stations in the hottentot coun-
try to prepare wagons provisions and
in short everything that could be wanted
for the victualing of a bochjesman car-
avan then as he knew the reputation
of the native hunter mokoum who had
accompanied anderson in his hunting
expeditions in western africa and the
intrepid david livingstone on his first
journey of exploration to lake ngami
and the falls of the zambesi he offered
him the command of this same caravan

  this done it was arranged that the
bushman who knew the country perfect-
ly should lead william emery along the
banks of the orange to the morgheda
falls the place appointed for the sci-
entific commission to join them this
commission was to take its passage in
the british frigate augusta to reach the
mouth of the orange on the western
coast of africa as high as cape vol-
tas and to ascend the river as far as
the cataracts william emery and mo-
koum had therefore brought a wagon
which they had left at the bottom of the
valley to carry the strangers and their
baggage to lattakoo unless they pre-
ferred getting there by the orange and
its affluents after they had avoided the
falls of morgheda by a larvjoumey of
some miles

  this story ended and at length really
impressed on the bushmans mind he
advanced to the edge of the gulf to
whose bottom the foaming river threw
itself with a crash the astronomer fol-
lowed for there a projecting point com-
manded a view of the river below the
cararact for a distance of several miles
for some minutes mokoum and his com-
panion gazed attentively at the part of
the river where it resumed its tranquil-
ity about a quarter of a mile below
them but not an object either boat or
pirogue disturbed its course it was
measuring a meridian



then three oclock the month of jan-
uary here corresponds to the july of
northern countries and the sun almost
vertical in lat  heated the atmos-
phere till the thermometer stood at 
fahrenheit in the shade if it had not
been for the westerly breeze which
moderated the heat a little the tempera-
ture would have been unbearable for any
but a bushman still the young astron-
omer with his cool temperament all
bone and all nerves did not feel it too
much the thick foliage of the trees
which overhung the abyss protected him
from the direct attacks of the suns
rays not a bird enlivened the solitude
during these hot hours of the day not
an animal left the cool shade of the
bushes to trust itself along the glades
not a sound would have been heard in
the deserted region even if the cataract
had not filled the whole air with its
roar

  after gazing for ten minutes mo-
koum turned to william emery stamp-
ing impatiently with his large foot his
penetrating eyes had discovered nothing

  supposing your people dont come
he asked the astronomer

  theyll come my brave hunter
answered william emery they are
men of their word and punctual like all
astronomers besides what fault do you
find with them the letter says they
are to arrive at the end of january this
is the th and these gentlemen have
still a right to four more days before
they need to reach the morgheda falls

  and supposing they have not come
at the end of those four days asked
the bushman

  well then master hunter there will
be a chance for us to show our pa-
tience for wc wait for them until i have
certain proof that they are not coming
at all

  by our god ko cried the bushman
in a sonorous voice you are a man

who would wait until the gariep had
emptied all its roaring waters into that
abyss

  no hunter no replied emery in
his ever quiet tone but we must let
reason govern our actions and what
does reason tell us this--that if
colonel everest and his co oanions
wearied with a tiresome journey in want
perhaps and lost in this lonely coun-
try were not to find us at the place of
rendezvous wc should be to blame in
every way if anything went wrong
the responsibility would rest on us we
ought therefore to stay at our post as
long as it is our duty to do so and be-
sides we want for nothing here our
wagon is waiting for us at the bottom
of the valley and gives us shelter at
night we have plenty of provisions na-
ture here is magnificent and worthy of
our admiration and it is quite a pleasure
to me to spend a few days in these
splendid forests on the banks of this
matchless river as for you mokoum
what can you want more game both
furry and feathered abounds in the
forests and your rifle keeps us supplied
with venison hunt my brave hunter
kill time by killing deer and buffaloes
go my good bushman ill watch for
the loiterers meanwhile and your feet
at any rate will run no risk of tak-
ing root

  the hunter thought the astronomers
advice was good and decided that he
would go for a few hours and beat the
neighboring bushes and brushwood
lions hyenas and leopards would not
disturb such a nimrod as he so well ac-
customed to the african forests he
whistled to his dog top an animal of
the hyena breed from the desert of kal-
ahari and a descendant of that race of
which the balabas formerly made point-
ers the intelligent creature as im-
patient seemingly as was his master
bounded up and showed by his joyous


amazing stories

barking how much he was gratified at
the bushmans intention soon both man
and dog disappeared among the thick
masses of wood which crowned the back-
ground of the cataract william em-
ery now alone again stretched himself
at the foot of the willow and while he
was waiting for the heat to send him to
sleep began to think over his actual
position here he was far away from
any inhabited spot on the banks of the
orange river a river as yet but little
explored he was waiting for euro-
peans fellow countrymen who had left
their homes to run the risks of a distant
expedition but what was the expedition
for what scientific problem could it
want to solve in the deserts of south
africa what observation could it be
trying to take in lat  that was
just what mr airy the director of the
greenwich observatory did not tell in
his letter as for emery himself they
asked for his co-operation as for that of
a scientific man who was familiar with
the climate of those southern latitudes
and as he was engaged in scientific
labors he was quite at the disposal of
his colleagues in the united kingdom

  as the young astronomer lay musing
over all these thing and asking himself
a thousand questions which he could not
answer his eyelids became heavy and
at length he slept soundly when he
awoke the sun was already hidden be-
hind the western hills whose picturesque
outline stood out sharply against the
bright horizon some gnawings of hun-
ger told him that supper-time was near
it was in fact six oclock and just the
hour for returning to the wagon at the
bottom of the valley at that very mo-
ment a report resounded from a grove
or arborescent heather from twelve to
fifteen feet high growing along the
slope of the hills on the right al-
most immediately the bushman and top
made their appearance at the edge of the

wood the former dragging behind him
the animal he had just shot come
come master purveyor cried emery
what have you got for supper 

  a spring-bok mr william replied
the hunter throwing down an animal
with horns curved like a lyre it was a
kind of antelope more generally known
by the name of leaping buck which
is to be met with in every part of
south africa it is a charming animal
with its cinnamon-colored back and its
shoulders covered with tufts of silky
hair of a dazzling whiteness whilst its
under part is in shades of chestnut
brown its flesh always excellent eat-
ing was on this occasion to form the
evening repast

  the hunter and the astronomer lifting
the beast by means of a pole placed
across their shoulders now left the
head of the cataract and in half an
hour reached their encampment in a nar-
row gorge of the valley where the
wagon guarded by two bochjesman driv-
ers was waiting for them

chapter ii

official introductions

for the next three days the th
th and th of january mo-
koum and william emery never left
the place of rendezvous while the bush-
man carried away by his hunting in-
stincts pursued the game and antelopes
in the wooded district lying near the cat-
aract the young astronomer watched the
river the sight of this grand wild
nature enchanted him and filled his soul
with new emotions accustomed as he
was to bend over his figures and cat-
alogues day and night hardly ever leav-
ing the eye-piece of his telescope watch-
ing the passage of stars across the mer-
idian and the occultations he delighted
in the open-air life in the almost im-
measuring a meridian



penetrable woods which covered the
slope of the hills and on the lonely
peaks that were sprinkled by the spray
from the morgheda as with a damp
dust it was joy to him to take in the
poetry of these vast solitudes and to re-
fresh his mind so wearied with his
mathematical speculations and so he be-
guiled the tediousness of his waiting
and became a new man both in mind
and body thus did the novelty of his
situation explain his unvarying patience
which the bushman could not share in
the least so there were continually on
the part of mokoum the same recrim-
inations and on the part of emery the
same quiet answers which however did
not quiet the nervous hunter in the
smallest degree

  and now the st of january had
come the last day fixed in airys letter
if the expected party did not then ar-
rive emery would be in a very embar-
rassing position the delay might be
indefinitely prolonged how long then
ought he to wait 

  mr william said the hunter why
shouldnt we go to meet these strangers
we cannot miss them there is only one
road that by the river and if they are
coming up as your bit of paper says
they are we are sure to meet

  that is a capital idea of yours mo-
koum replied the astronomer we will
go on and look out below the falls we
can get back to the encampment by the
side valleys in the south but tell me
my good bushman you know nearly the
whole course of the river do you not
yes sir answered the hunter i
have ascended it twice from cape vol-
tas to its juncture with the hart on the
frontier of the transvaal republic
and it is navigable all the way ex-
cept at the falls of morgheda

  just so sir replied the bushman
but i should add that at the end of
the dry season the orange has not much

water till within five or six miles of
its mouth there is there a bar where
the swell from the west breaks very
violently

  that doesnt matter answered the
astronomer because at the time that
our friends want to land it will be all
right there is nothing to keep them
back so they will come

  the bushman said nothing but shoul-
dering his gun and whistling to top he
led the way down the narrow path which
met the river again  feet lower

  it was then nine oclock in the morn-
ing and the two explorers for such
they might truly be called followed the
river by its left bank their way did
not offer the smooth and easy surface of
an embankment or towing-path for the
river-banks were covered with brush-
wood and quite hidden in a bower of
every variety of plants and the fes-
toons of the cynauchum filiform men-
tioned by burchell hanging from tree
to tree formed quite a network of ver-
dure in their path the bushmans knife
however did not long remain inactive
and he cut down the obstructive branches
without mercy william emery drank
in the fragrant air here especially im-
pregnated with the camphor-like odor
of the countless blooms of thediosma
happily there were sometimes more
open places along the bank devoid of
vegetation where the river flowed quiet-
ly and abounded in fish and these en-
abled the hunter and his companion to
make better progress westward so that
by eleven oclock they had gone about
four miles the wind being in the
west the roar of the cataract could not
be heard at that distance but on the
other hand all sounds below the falls
were very distinct william emery and
the hunter as they stood could see
straight down the river for three or four
miles chalk cliffs  feet high over-
hung and shut in its bed on either side


amazing stories

  let us stop and rest here said the
astronomer i havent your hunters
legs mokoum and am more used to the
starry paths of the heavens than to
those on terra firma so let us have a
rest we can see three or four miles
down the river from here and if the
steamer should turn that last bend we
are sure to see it

  the young astronomer seated himself
against a giant euphorbia forty feet
high and in that position looked down
the river while the hunter little used to
sitting continued to walk along the
bank and top roused up clouds of wild
birds to which however his master
gave no heed they had been here about
half an hour when william emery
noticed that mokoum who was stand-
ing about  feet behind him gave
signs of a closer attention was it likely
that he had seen the long-expected boat
the astronomer leaving his mossy couch
started for the spot where the hunter
stood and came up to him in a very few
moments

  do you see anything mokoum he
asked

  i see nothing mr william an-
swered the bushman but it seems to
me that there is an unusual murmur
down the river different to the natural
sounds that are so familiar to my ears
and then telling his companion to be
quiet he lay down with his ear to the
ground and listened attentively in a
few minutes he got up and shaking his
head said i was mistaken the noise
i thought i heard was nothing but the
breeze among the leaves or the murmur
of the water over the stones at the edge
and yet-

  the hunter listened again but again
heard nothing

  mokoum then said emery if the
noise you thought you heard is caused
by the machinery of a steamboat you
would hear better by stooping to the

level of the river water always conducts
sound more clearly and quickly than
air

  you are right mr william an-
swered mokoum for more than once
i have found out the passage of a hip-
popotamus across the river in that way

  the bushman went nimbly down the
bank clinging to the creepers and tufts
of grass on his way when he got to
the level of the river he went in to his
knees and stooping down laid his ear
close to the water

  yes he exclaimed in a few minutes
i was not mistaken there is a sound
some miles down as if the waters
were being violently beaten it is a con-
tinual monotonous splashing which is in-
troduced into the current

  is it like a screw asked the astron-
omer

  perhaps it is mr emery they are
not far off

  william emery did not hesitate to be-
lieve his companions assertion for he
knew that the hunter was endowed with
great delicacy of sense whether he used
his eyes nose or ears mokoum climbed
up the bank again and they determined
to wait in that place as they could eas-
ily see down the river from there half
an hour passed which to emery in spite
of his calmness appeared interminable
ever so many times he fancied he saw
the dim outline of a boat gliding along
the river but he was always mistaken
at last an exclamation from the bush-
man made his heart leap

  smoke cried mokoum

  looking in the direction indicated by
the bushman emery could see a light
streak rolling round the bend of the
river there was no longer any doubt
the vessel advanced rapidly and he
could soon make out the funnel pouring
forth a torrent of black smoke mingling
with white steam they had evidently
made up their fires to increase their
measuring a meridian



speed so as to reach the appointed place
cm the proper day the vessel was still
about seven miles from the falls of
morgheda it was then twelve oclock
and as it was not a good place for land-
ing the astronomer determined to return
to the foot of the cataract he told his
plan to the hunter who only answered
by turning back along the path he had
just cleared along the left bank of the
stream emery followed and turning
round for the last time at a bend in
the river saw the british flag floating
from the stern of the vessel the re-
turn to the falls was soon effected and
in an hours time the bushman and the
astronomer halted a quarter of a mile
below the cataract for there the shore
hollowed into a semicircle formed a
little cove and as the water was deep
right up to the bank the steamboat could
easily land its passengers the vessel
could not be far off now and it had cer-
tainly gained on the two pedestrians
although they had walked so fast it was
not yet in sight for the lofty trees which
hung quite over the river-banks into the
water and the slope of the banks them-
selves did not allow of an extensive
view but although they could not hear
the sound made by the steam the
pulsing of the machinery broke in dis-
tinctly on the monotonous roar of the
cataract and as the whistling continued
it was evident that it was a signal from
the boat to announce its arrival near the
falls the hunter replied by letting off
his gun the report being repeated with
a crash by the echoes of the shore at
last the vessel was in sight and william
emery and his companion were seen by
those on board at a sign from the
astronomer the vessel turned and glided
quietly alongside the bank a rope was
thrown ashore which the bu simian
seized and twisted round the broken
stump of a tree and immediately a tall
man sprang lightly on the bank and

went towards the astronomer whilst his
companions landed in their turn wil-
liam emery also advanced to meet the
stranger saying inquiringly colonel
everest 

  mr william emery answered the
colonel

 the astronomer bowed and shook
hands

  gentlemen then said colonel ever-
est let me introduce you to mr wil-
liam emery of the cape town observa-
tory who has kindly come as far as
the morgheda falls to meet us

 four of the passengers who stood
near colonel everest bowed to the young
astronomer who did the same and
then the colonel with his british self-
possession introduced them officially
saying

  mi emery sir john murray of the
county of devon your fellow-country-
man mr matthew strux of the poul-
kowa observatory mr nicholas palan-
der of the helsingfors observatory
and mr michael zorn of the kiew
observatory three scientific gentlemen
who represent that russian government
in our international commission

chapter iii

the portage

these introductions over william
emery put himself at the disposal
of the new arrivals for in his posi-
tion of astronomer at the cape he was
inferior in rank to colonel everest a
delegate of the english government and
with matthew strux joint president of
the commission he knew as well that
he was a distinguished man of science
famous for his reductions of the nebulae
and his calculations of the occultations
of the stars he was a cold methodical
man of about fifty years of age every
hour of his life being portioned out with


amazing stories

mathematical accuracy nothing unfore-
seen ever happened to him and his punc-
tuality in everything was like that of
the stars in passing the meridian and it
might be said that all his doings were
regulated by the chronometer william
emery knew all this and had therefore
never doubted that the commission would
arrive on the appointed day during this
time he was waiting for the colonel to
tell him the object of his mission to
south africa but as he was still silent
on the point emery thought it better
not to ask any questions as very likely
the hour fixed in the colonels mind for
the subject had not yet come

  emery also knew by repute the wealthy
sir john murray who almost a rival
to sir james ross and lord elgin
was although without office an honor to
england by his scientific labors his
pecuniary sacrifices to science were like-
wise considerable for he had devoted
 to the establishment of a giant
reflector a match for the telescope at
parson town by whose means the ele-
ments of a number of double stars had
just been determined he was a man of
about forty years of age with an aris-
tocratic bearing but whose character it
was impossible to discover through his
imperturbable exterior

  as to the three russians-strux
palander and zorn-their names were
also well known to william emery
although he was not personally ac-
quainted with them nicholas palander
and michael zorn paid a certain amount
of deference to matthew strux as was
due to his position if it had not been
to his merit

  the only thing that emery remarked
was that they were in equal numbers
three english and three russians and
the crew of the queen and czar for
that was the name of the steamboat
consisted of ten men five english and
five russians

  mr emery said colonel everest
when the introductions were over we
are now as well acquainted as if we had
traveled together from london to cape
voltas besides your labors have al-
ready earned you a just renown and
on that account i hold you in high es-
teem it was at my request that the
english government appointed you to
assist in our operations in south africa
william emery bowed in acknowledg-
ment and thought that he was now go-
ing to hear the object of the scientific
commission to the southern hemisphere
but still colonel everest did not explain
it

  mr emery he went on are your
preparations complete 

  quite colonel replied the astron-
omer according to the directions in
mr airys letter i left cape town a
month ago and went to the station at
lattakoo and there i collected all the
materials for an expedition into the
interior of africa-provisions wagons
horses and bushmen there is an es-
cort of  armed men waiting for you
at lattakoo and they will be under the
command of a clever and celebrated
hunter whom i now beg to present to
you the bushman mokoum

  the bushman mokoum cried the
colonel if his usual cold tone could
justify such a verb the bushman mo-
koum  i know his name perfectly
well

  it is the name of a clever brave
african added sir john murray turn-
ing to the hunter who was not at all
discomposed by the grand airs of the
europeans

  the hunter mokoum said william
emery as he introduced his companion

  your name is well known in the
united kingdom bushman replied
colonel everest you were the friend
of anderson and the guide of david
livingstone whose friend i have the
measuring a meridian



honor of being i thank you in the
name of england and i congratulate mr
emery on having chosen you as the
chief of our caravan such a hunter as
you must be a connoisseur of firearms
and as we have a very fair supply i
shall beg you to take your choice of the
one which will suit you the best we
know that it will be in good hands

  a smile of satisfaction played round
the bushmans lips for although he was
no doubt gratified by the recognition
of his services in england yet the colo-
nels offer touched him the most he then
returned thanks in polite terms and
stepped aside while emery and the eu-
ropeans continued their conversation

  the young astronomer went through
all the details of the expedition he had
prepared and the colonel seemed de-
lighted he was anxious to reach lat-
takoo as quickly as possible as the car-
avan ought to start at the beginning of
march after the rainy season

  will you be kind enough to decide
how you will get to the town colonel
everest said william emery

  by the orange river and one of its
affluents the kuruman which flows
closc to lattakoo

  true replied the astronomer but
however well your vessel may travel
it cannot possibly ascend the cataract of
morglieda 

  we will go round the cataract mr
emery replied the colonel and by
making a land journey of a few miles
we can re-embark above the falls and
from there to lattakoo if i am not
mistaken the rivers are navigable for
a vessel that does not draw much water
no doubt colonel answered wil-
liam emery but this steamboat is too
heavy

  mr emery interrupted the colonel
this vessel is a masterpiece from lairds
yard in liverpool it can be taken to
pieces and is put together again with the

greatest ease a key and a few bolts be-
ing all that is required by men used to
the work you brought a wagon to the
falls did you not

  yes colonel answered emery our
encampment is not a mile away

  well i must beg the bushman to
have the wagon brought to the landing-
place and it will then be loaded with
the portions of the vessel and its ma-
chinery which also can be taken to
pieces and we shall then get to the spot
where the orange becomes navigable
colonel everests orders were obeyed
the bushman disappeared quickly in the
underwood promising to be back in less
than an hour and while he was gone
the steamboat was rapidly unloaded the
cargo was not very considerable it con-
sisted of some cases of philosophical in-
struments a fair collection of guns of
purdey moores manufacture of edin-
burgh  some kegs of brandy some canis-
ters of preserved meats cases of ammu-
nition  portmanteaus reduced to the
smallest size tent-cloths and all their
utensils looking as if they had comc
out of a traveling-bazaar a carefully
packed gutta-percha canoe which took
up no more room than a well-folded
counterpane some materials for en-
camping etc etc and lastly a fan-
shaped mitrailleuse a machine not then
brought to perfection but formidable
enough to terrify any enemy who might
come across their path all these were
placed on the bank and the engine of
-horsepower was divided into three
parts the boiler and its tubes the mech-
anism which was parted from the boiler
by a turn of a key and the screw at-
tached to the false stern-post when
these had been successively carried away
the inside of the vessel was left free
besides the space reserved for the ma-
chinery and the stores it was divided
into a fore-cabin for the use of the
crew and an aft-cabin occupied by colo-

nel everest and his companions in the
twinkling of an eye the partitions van-
ished all the chests and bedsteads were
lifted out and now the vessel was re-
duced to a mere shell thirty feet long
and composed of three parts like the
ma-robert the steam vessel used by dr
livingstone in his first voyage up the
zambesi it was made of galvanized
steel so that it was light and at the same
time resisting the bolts which fastened
the plates over a framework of the same
metal kept them firm and also pre-
vented the possibility of a leakage wil-
liam emery was truly astounded at the
simplicity of the work and the rapidity
with which it was executed the wagon
under the guidance of mokoum and the
two bochjesmen had only arrived an
hour when they were ready to load it
the wagon rather a primitive vehicle
was mounted on four massive wheels
each pair being about twenty feet
apart it was a regular american car
in length this clumsy machine with
its creaking axles projecting a good foot
beyond the wheels was drawn by six
tame buffaloes two and two who
were extremely sensitive to the long goad
carried by their driver it required
nothing less than such beasts as these
to move the vehicle when heavily laden
for in spite of the adroitness of the
leader it stuck in the mire more than
once the crew of the queen and czar
now proceeded to load the wagon so as
to balance it well everywhere the dex-
terity of sailors is proverbial and the
lading of the vehicle was like play to
the brave men they laid the larger
pieces of the boat on the strongest part
of the wagon immediately over the axles
of the wheels so that the cases chests
barrels and the lighter and more fragile
packages easily found room between
them as to the travelers themselves
a four-mile walk was nothing to them
by three oclock the loading was finished

and colonel everest gave the signal
for starting he and his companions
with william emery as guide took the
lead while the bushmen the crew and
the drivers of the wagon followed more
slowly they performed the journey
without fatigue for the slopes that led
to the upper course of the orange made
their road easy by making it longer
and this was a happy thing for the
heavily laden wagon as it would thus
reach the goal more surely if more
slowly

  the different members of the commis-
sion clambered lightly up the side of the
hill and the conversation became gen-
eral but there was still no mention of
the object of the expedition the euro-
peans were admiring the splendid scenes
that were opened to their view for this
grand nature so beautiful in its wildness
charmed them as it had charmed the
young astronomer and their voyage had
not yet surfeited them with the natural
beauties of this african region though
they observed everything with a quiet ad-
miration and english-like would not
do anything that might seem improper
however the cataract drew forth some
graceful applause and although they
clapped perhaps with only the tips of
their fingers yet it was enough to show
that nil admirari was not quite their
motto besides william emery thought
it his duty to do the honors of south
africa to his guests for he was at
home and like certain over-enthusiastic
citizens he did not spare a detail of
his african park towards half-past
four they had passed the cataract of
morgheda and being now on level
ground the upper part of the river-lav-
before them as far as their eye could
reach and they encamped on the bank
to await the arrival of the wagon it
appeared at the top of the hill about five
oclock having accomplished the journey
in safety and colonel everest ordered it
measuring a meridian



to be unloaded immediately announcing
that they were to start at daybreak the
next morning all the night was passed
in different occupations the hull of
the vessel was put together again in
less than an hour then the boiler and
machinery were put into place the
metal partitions were fixed between the
cabins the store-rooms were refur-
nished and the different packages neatly
arranged on board and everything done
so quickly that it told a great deal in
favor of the crew of the queen and
czar these englishmen and russians
were picked men clever and well disci-
plined and thoroughly to be depended
on the next day the st of febru-
ary the boat was ready to receive its
passengers at daybreak already there
was a volume of black smoke pouring
from the funnel and the engineer to
put the machinery in motion was caus-
ing jets of white steam to fly across the
smoke the machine being high pres-
sure without a condenser the steam
escaped at every stroke of the piston
according to the system applied to loco-
motives and as to the boiler with its
ingeniously contrived tubes presenting
a large surface to the furnace it only
required half an hour to furnish a
sufficient quantity of steam they had
laid in a good stock of ebony and guia-
cum which were plentiful in the neigh-
borhood and they were now feeding the
great fire with this valuable wood

  at six oclock colonel everest gave
the signal for starting and the passen-
gers and crew went on board the queen
and czar the hunter who was ac-
quainted with the course of the river
followed leaving two eochjcsmcn to
take the wagon back to lattakoo just
as the vessel was slipping its cable
colonel everest turned to the astron-
omer and said

  by-the-bye mr emery you know
why we have come here

  i have not the least idea colonel
it is very simple mr emery we
have come to measure an arc of meridian
in south africa

chapter iv

the meter

the idea of an invariable and
constant system of measurement
of which nature herself should
furnish the exact value may be said
to have existed in the mind of man
from the earliest ages it was of the
highest importance however that this
measurement should be accurately de-
termined whatever had been the cata-
clysms of which our earth had been
the scene and it is certain that the
ancients felt the same though they
failed in methods and appliances for
carrying out the work with sufficient
accuracy the best way of obtaining
a constant measurement was to connect
it with the terrestrial sphere whose cir-
cumference must be considered as invari-
able and then to measure the whole or
part of that circumference mathematic-
ally the ancients had tried to do this
and aristotle according to some con-
temporary philosophers reckoned that
the stadium or egyptian cubit formed
the hundred-thousandth part of the dis-
tance between the pole and the equator
and eratosthenes in the time of the
ptolemies calculated the value of a de-
gree along the nile between syene and
alexandria pretty correctly but posi-
donius and ptolemy were not sufficiently
accurate in the same kind of geodetic
operations that they undertook neither
were their successors

  picard for the first time in france
began to regulate the methods that were
used for measuring a degree and in
 by measuring the celestial and
terrestrial arcs between paris and ami-


amazing stories

ens found that a degree was equal to

	toises equivalent to  eng-
lish feet or about  miles picards
measurement was continued either way
across the french territory as far as
dunkirk and collioure by dominic cas-
sini and lahire - and it
was verified in  from dunkirk to
perpignan by francis cassini and la-
caille and at length mechain carried it
as far as barcelona in spain but after
his death for he succumbed to the
fatigue attending his operation the
measurement of the meridian in france
was interrupted until it was subsequently
taken up by arago and biot in 
these two men prolonged it as far as
the balearic isjes so that the arc now
extended from dunkirk to formentera
being equally divided by the parallel of
latitude  n half way between the
pole and the equator and under these
conditions it was not necessary to take
the depression of the earth into account
in order to find the value of the quadrant
of the meridian this measurement gave
 toises as the mean value of an
arc of a degree in france

  it can be seen that up to that time
frenchmen especially had undertaken to
determine that delicate point and it was
likewise the french convention that
according to talleyrands proposition
passed a resolution in  charging
the academy of sciences to invent an
invariable system of weights and meas-
ures just at that time the statement
signed by the illustrious names of
borda lagrange laplace monge and
condorcet proposed that the unit of
measurement should be the meter the
ten-millionth part of the quadrant of
the meridian and that the unit of weight
should be the gramme a cubic centi-
meter of distilled water at the freezing-
point and that the multiples and sub-
divisions of every measure should be
formed decimally

  later the determination of the value
of a terrestrial degree was carried on in
different parts of the world for the
earth being not spherical but elliptic it
required much calculation to find the
depression at the poles

  in  maupertius clairaut camus
lemonnier outhier and the swedish
celsius measured a northern arc in
lapland and found the length of an
arc of a degree to be  toises
in  la condaminc bouguer and
godin set sail for peru where they were
joined by the spanish officers juan and
antonio ulloa and they then found that
the peruvian arc contained  toises

  in  lacalle reported  toises
as the length of the arc he had meas-
ured at the cape of good hope

  in  father boscowitch and
father le maire began a survey of the
papal states and in the course of their
operations found the arc between rome
and rimini to be  toises

  in  and  beccaria reckoned
the degree in piedmont at  toises
and in  the astronomers mason and
dixon in north america on the con-
fines of maryland and pennsylvania
found that the value of the degree in
america was  toises

  since the beginning of the nineteenth
century numbers of other arcs have
been measured-in bengal the east in-
dies piedmont finland courland east
prussia denmark etc but the english
and russians were less active than other
nations in trying to decide this delicate
point their principal geodetic operation
being undertaken by general roy in
 for the purpose of determining
the difference of longitude between paris
and greenwich

  it may be concluded from all the
above-mentioned measurements that the
mean value of a degree is  toises
or  ancient french leagues and by
multiplying this mean value by the 
measuring a meridian



degrees contained in the circumference
it is found that the earth measures 
leagues around but as may be seen
from the figures above the measure-
ments of the different arcs in different
parts of the world do not quite agree
nevertheless by taking this average of

	toises for the value of a degree
the value of the meter that is to say
the ten-millionth part of the quadrant
of the meridian may be deduced and
is found to be  of the whole
line or  english inches in
reality this value is rather too small for
later calculations taking into account
the depression of the earth at the poles
which is  and not  as
was thought at first now gives nearly
 meters instead of 
for the length of the quadrant of the
meridian the difference of  meters
is hardly noticeable in such a long dis-
tance but nevertheless mathematically
speaking it cannot be said that the
meter as it is now used represents the
ten-millionth part of the quadrant of
the terrestrial meridian exactly there is
an error of about  of a line i e
 of the twelfth part of an inch

  the meter thus determined was still
not adopted by all the civilized nations
belgium spain piedmont greece hol-
land the old spanish colonies the re-
publics of the equator new granada
and costa rica took a fancy to it im-
mediately but notwithstanding the evi-
dent superiority of this metrical system
to every other england had refused to
use it perhaps if it had not been for
the political disturbances which arose at
the close of the eighteenth century the
inhabitants of the united kingdom
would have accepted the system for
when the constituent assembly issued
its decree on the th of may 
the members of the royal society in
england were invited to co-operate with
the french academicians they had to

decide whether the measure of the
meter should be founded on the length
of the pendulum that beats the sex-
agesimal second or whether the should
take a fraction of one of the great
circles of the earth for a unit of length
but events prevented the proposed con-
ference and so it was not until the
year  that england having long
seen the advantage of the metrical sys-
tem and that scientific and commercial
societies were being founded to spread
the reform resolved to adopt it but
still the english government wished to
keep their resolution a secret until the
new geodetic operations that they had
commenced should enable them to as-
sign a more correct value to the terres-
trial degree and they thought they had
better act in concert with the russian
government who were also hesitating
about adopting the system a commis-
sion of three englishmen and three rus-
sians was therefore chosen from among
the most eminent members of the sci-
entific societies and we have seen that
they were colonel everest sir john
murray and william emery for eng-
land  and matthew strux nicholas
palander and michael zorn for russia
the international commission having
met in london decided first of all that
the measure of an arc of meridian
should be taken in the southern hemi-
sphere and that another arc should
subsequently be measured in the north-
ern hemisphere so that from the two
operations they might hope to deduce an
exact value which should satisfy all the
conditions of the programme it now
remained to choose between the differ-
ent english possessions in the southern
hemisphere cape colony australia and
new zealand the two last lying quite
at the antipodes of europe would in-
volve the commission in a long voyage
and besides the maoris and australians
who were often at war with their in-


amazing stories

vaders might render the proposed op-
eration difficult while cape colony on
the contrary offered real advantages
in the first place it was under the
same meridian as parts of european
russia so that after measuring an arc
of meridian in south africa they could
measure a second one in the empire of
the czar and still keep their operations
a secret secondly the voyage from eng-
land to south africa was comparatively
short and thirdly these english and
russian philosophers would find an ex-
cellent opportunity there of analyzing
the labors of the french astronomer
lacaille who had worked in the same
place and of proving whether he was
correct in giving  toises as the
measurement of a degree of meridian
at the cape of good hope it was
therefore decided that the geodetic op-
eration should be commenced at the
cape and as the two governments ap-
proved of the decision large credits
were opened and two sets of all the
instruments required in a triangulation
were manufactured the astronomer
william emery was asked to make
preparations for an exploration in the
interior of south africa and the frig-
ate augusta of the royal navy received
orders to convey the members of the
commission and their suite to the mouth
of the orange river

  it should here be added that besides
the scientific question diere was also
a question of national vain-glory that
excited these philosophers to join in
a common labor for in reality they
were anxious to out-do france in her
numerical calculations and to surpass
in precision the labors of her most illus-
trious astronomers and that in the heart
of a savage and almost unknown land
thus the members of the anglo-russian
commission had resolved to sacrifice
everything even their lives in order to
obtain a result that should be favorahle

to science and at the same time glorious
for their country and this is how it
came to pass that the astronomer wil-
liam emery found himself at the
morgheda falls on the banks of the
orange river at the end of january


chapter v

a hottentot village

the voyage along the upper course
of the river was quickly accom-
plished and although the weather
soon became rainy the passengers com-
fortably installed in the ships cabin
suffered no inconvenience from the tor-
rents of rain which usually fall at that
season the queen and czar shot along
swiftly for there were neither rapids
nor shallows and the current was not
sufficiently strong to retard her progress
every aspect of the river-banks was
enchanting forest followed upon forest
and quite a world of birds dwelt among
the leafy branches here and there
were groups of trees belonging to the
family of the proteaceze and espe-
cially the wagenboom with its reddish
marble-wood forming a curious contrast
with its deep blue leaves and large pale
yellow flowers then there were the
zwartebasts with their black bark
and the karrees with dark evergreen
foliage the banks were shaded every-
where by weeping willows while the
underwood extended beyond for several
miles every now and then vast open
tracts presented themselves unexpect-
edly large plains covered with innu-
merable colocynths mingled with sugar-
bushes out of which flew clouds of
sweet-singing little birds called suiker-
vogels by the cape colonists the
winged world offered many varieties
all of which were pointed out to sir
john murray by the bushman sir john
measuring a meridian



was a great lover of game both furry
and feathered and thus a sort of in-
timacy arose between him and mokoum
to whom according to colonel ever-
ests promise he had given an excellent
long range rifle made on the pauly
system it would be useless to attempt
a description of the bushmans delight
when he found himself in possession
of such a splendid weapon

  the two hunters understood each
other well for though so learned sir
john murray passed for one of the most
brilliant fox-huntcrs in old caledonia
and he listened to the bushmans stories
with an interest amounting to envy
his eyes sparkled when mokoum showed
him the wild ruminants in the woods
here a herd of fifteen to twenty giraffes
there buffaloes six feet high with tow-
ering black horns farther on fierce
gnus with horses tails and again herds of
caamas a large kind of antelope with
bright eyes and horns forming a threat-
ening looking triangle and everywhere
in the dense forests as well as in the
open plains the innumerable varieties
of antelopes which abound in south-
ern africa the spurious chamois the
gems-bok the gazelle the duiker-bok
and the spring-bok was not all this
something to tempt a hunter and could
the fox-hunts of the scottish low-lands
vie with the exploits of a cumming
an anderson or a baldwin it must
be confessed that sir john murrays
companions were less excited than him-
self at these magnificent specimens of
wild game

  william emery was watching his col-
leagues attentively and trying to dis-
cover their character under their cold
exterior colonel everest and matthew
strux men of about the same age were
equally cold reserved and formal they
always spoke with a measured slowness
and from morning to night it seemed as
if they had never met before that

any intimacy should ever be established
between two such important personages
was a thing not to be hoped for two ice-
bergs placed side by side would join in
time but two scientific men each holding
a high position never

  nicholas palander a man of about
fifty-five years of age was one of
those who have never been young and
who will never be old the astronomer
of helsingfors constantly absorbed in
his calculations might be a very admir-
ably constructed machine but still he
was nothing but a machine a kind of
abacus or universal reckoner he was
the calculator of the anglo-russian
commission and one of those prodigies
who work out multiplications to five
figures in their head like a fifty-year-
old mondeux

  michael zorn more nearly resembled
william emery in age enthusiasm and
good humor his amiable qualities did
not prevent his being an astronomer of
great merit having attained an early
celebrity the discoveries made by him
at the kiew observatory concerning the
nebula of andromeda had attracted at-
tention in scientific europe and yet with
this undoubted merit he had a great deal
of modesty and was always in the
background william emery and mich-
ael zorn were becoming great friends
united by the same tastes and aspira-
tions  and most generally they were
talking together while colonel everest
and matthew strux were coldly watch-
ing each other and palander was men-
tally extracting cube roots without no-
ticing the lovely scenes on the banks
and sir john murray and the bushman
were forming plans for hunting down
whole hecatombs of victims

  no incident marked the voyage along
the upper course of the orange some-
times the granite cliffs which shut in
the winding bed of the river seemed to
forbid further progress and often the


amazing stories

wooded islands which dotted the cur-
rent seemed to render the route uncer-
tain but the bushman never hesitated
and the queen and czar always chose
the right route and passed round the
cliffs without hindrance the helmsman
never had to repent of having followed
mokoums directions

  in four days the steamboat had passed
over the  miles between the cataract
of morgheda and the kuruman an
affluent which flowed exactly past the
town of lattakoo whither colonel ev-
erests expedition was bound about
thirty leagues above the falls the river
bends from its general direction which
is east and west and flows southeast
as far as the acute angle which the ter-
ritory of cape colony makes in the
north and then turning to the north-
east it loses itself in the wooded coun-
try of the transvaal republic it was
early in the morning of the th of feb-
ruary in a driving rain that the queen
and czar arrived at klaarwater a hot-
tentot village close to the meeting of
the orange and kuruman colonel
everest unwilling to lose a moment
passed quickly by the few boschjcsman
cabins that form the village and under
the pressure of her screw the vessel
began to ascend the affluent the rapid
current was to be attributed as the pas-
sengers remarked to a peculiarity in
the river for the kuruman being wide
at its source was lessened as it de-
scended by the influence of the suns
rays but at this season swollen by
the rains and further increased by the
waters of a sub-affluent the moschona
it became very deep and rapid the
fires were therefore made up and the
vessel ascended the kuruman at the rate
of three miles an hour

  during the voyage the bushman point-
ed out a good many hippopotami in
the water but these great pachyderms
clumsy thickset beasts from eight to

ten feet long which the dutch at the
cape call sea-cows were by no means
of an aggressive nature and the hissing
of the steam and the beating of the
scrcw quite frightened them the boat
appearing to them like some great
monster which they ought to distrust
and in fact the arsenal on board would
have rendered approach very difficult
sir john murray would have very much
liked to try his explosive bullet on the
fleshy masses but the bushman assured
him that there would be no lack of
hippopotami in the more northerly rivers
so he determined to wait for a more
favorable opportunity

  the  miles which separated the
mouth of the kuruman from the station
of lattakoo were traversed in fifty
hours and on the th of february the
travelers had readied the end of their
journey as soon as the steamboat
was moored to the bank which served
as a quay a man of fifty years of age
with a grave air but kind countenance
stepped on board and offered his hand
to william emery the astronomer in-
troduced the new-comer to his traveling
comopanions as the rev thomas dale
of the london missionary society gov-
ernor of the station of lattakoo

  the europeans bowed to mr dale
who gave them welcome and put him-
self at their service

  the town of lattakoo or rather the
village of that name is the most north-
erly of the cape missionary stations
and is divided into old and new the
first which the queen and czar now
reached had  inhabitants at the
beginning of the century but they have
since emigrated to the northeast and
the town now fallen into decay has
been replaced by new lattakoo which
is built close by on a plain which was
formerly covered with acacias and
thither mr dale conducted the euro-
peans it consisted of about forty
measuring a meridian



groups of houses and contained 
or  inhabitants of the tribe of
the bechuanas dr livingstone stayed
in this town for three months before
his first voyage up the zambesi in 
previous to crossing the whole of cen-
tral africa from the bay of leander
to the port of kilmana on the coast
of mozambique

  when they reached new lattakoo
colonel everest presented a letter from
dr livingstone which commended the
anglo-russian commission to his friends
in south africa mr dale read it with
much pleasure and returned it to the
colonel saying that he might find it
useful on his journey as the name of
david livingstone was known and hon-
ored throughout that part of africa

  the members of the commission were
lodged in the missionary establishment
a large house built on an eminence and
surrounded by an impenetrable hedge
like a fortification the europeans could
be more comfortably lodged here than
with the bechuanas not that their dwell-
ings were not kept properly in order
on the contrary the smooth clay floors
did not show a particle of dust and
the long-thatched roofs were quite rain-
proof but at best their houses were
little better than huts with a round
hole for a door hardly large enough to
admit a man moreover they all lived
in common and close contact with the
bechuanas would scarcely have been
agreeable

  the chief of the tribe one moult-
bahan lived at lattakoo and thought it
right to come and pay his respects to
the europeans he was rather a fine
man without the thick lips and flat
nose of the negro with a round face
not so shrunken in its lower part as
that of the other hottentots he was
dressed in a cloak of skins sewn to-
gether with considerable art anad an
apron called a pujoke he wore a

leather skull-cap and sandals of ox-hide
ivory rings were strung round his arms
and from his ears hung brass plates
about four inches long-a kind of ear-
ring-which is also a charm an ante-
lopes tail stood up his skull-cap and his
hunting stick was surmounted by a tuft
of small black ostrich feathers the
natural color of his body was quite
invisible through the thick coating of
ochre with which he was besmeared from
head to foot while some ineffaceable in-
cisions in his legs denoted the number
of enemies he had slain

  the chief as grave as matthew strux
himself stepped up to the europeans
and took them in turn by the nose
the russians permitted this to be done
quite gravely the english rather more
reluctantly but still it had to be done
for according to african custom it
denoted a solemn engagement to fulfill
the duties of hospitality to the euro-
peans when the ceremony was over
moulibahan retired without having ut-
tered a word

  and now that we are naturalized
bechuanas said colonel everest let
us begin our operations without losing
a day or an hour

  and indeed no time was lost still
such is the variety of detail required
in the organization of an expedition of
this character the commission was not
ready to start until the beginning of
march that however was the time
appointed by colonel everest because
then the rainy season just being over
the water preserved in the fissures of
the earth would furnish a valuable
resource to travelers in the desert

  on the d of march then the whole
caravan under mokoums command was
ready the europeans took farewell of
the missionaries at lattakoo and left the
village at seven oclock in the morning

  where are we going colonel 
asked william emery as the caravan


amazing stories

passed the last house in town

  straight on mr emery answered
the colonel until we reach a suitable
place for establishing a base

  at eight oclock the caravan had passed
over the low shrubby hills which skirt
the town and soon the desert with its
dangers fatigues and risks lay unfolded
before the travelers

acquaintance and friendship

the cscort under the bushmans
command was composed of 
men all bochjesmen-an industri-
ous good-tempered people capable of
enduring great physical fatigue in
former times before the arrival of the
missionaries these bochjesmen were a
lying inhospitable race thinking of
nothing but murder and pillage and
taking advantage of an enemys sleep
to massacre him to a great extent
the missionaries have modified these
barbarous habits but the natives are still
more or less farm-pillagers and cattle-
lifters

  ten wagons like the vehicle which
mokoum had taken to the morgheda
falls formed the bulk of the expedi-
tion two of these were like moving
houses fitted up as they were with a
certain amount of comfort and served
as an encampment for the europeans
so that colonel everest and his com-
panions were followed about by a wood-
en habitation with dry flooring and
well tiled with water-proof cloth and
furnished with beds and toilet furniture
thus on arriving at each place of en-
campment the tent was always ready
pitched of these wagons one was ap-
propriated to colonel everest and his
countrymen sir john murray and
william emery the other was used by
the russians matthew strux nicholas

palandera and michael zorn two
more arranged in the same way be-
longed one to the five englishmen
and the other to the five russians who
composed the crew of the queen and
czar

  the hull and machinery of the steam-
boat taken to pieces and laid on one
of the wagons followed the travelers
in case the commission might come
across some of the numerous lakes which
are found in the interior of the con-
tinent

  the remaining wagons carried the
tools provisions baggage arms and am-
munition as well as the instruments
required for the proposed trigonometric
survey the provisions of the bochjes-
men consisted principally of antelope
buffalo or elephant meat preserved in
long strips being dried in the sun or
by a slow fire thus economizing the use
of salt here very scarce in the place
of bread the bochjesmen depended on
the earth-nuts of the arachis the bulbs
of various species of mesembryanthe-
mums and other native productions
animal food would be provided by
the hunters of the party who adroitly
employing their bows and lances would
scour the plains and revictual the car-
avan

  six native oxen long-legged high-
shouldered and with great horns were
attached to each wagon with harness
of buffalo hide thus the primitive
vehicles moved slowly though surely on
their massive wheels ready alike for
heights or valleys for the travelers
to ride there were provided small black
or gray spanish horses good-tempered
brave animals imported from south
america and much esteemed at the
cape among the troops of quadrupeds
were also half a dozen tame quaggas
a kind of ass with plump bodies and
slender legs who make a noise like the
barking of a dog they were to be
measuring a meridian



used in the smaller expeditions neces-
sary to the geodetic operations and were
adapted to carry the instruments where
the wagons could not venture the only
exception to the others was the bush-
man who rode a splendid zebra with
remarkable grace and dexterity this
animal the beauty o whose coat with
its brown stripes especially excited the
admiration of the connoisseur sir john
murray was naturally defiant and sus-
picious and would not have borne any
otherder than mokoum who had
broken it for his own use some dogs
of a half savage breed sometimes
wrongly called hyena-hunters ran by
the side of the wagons their shape and
long ears reminding one of the euro-
pean brach-hound

  such was the caravan which was about
to bury itself in the deserts the oxen
advanced calmly under the guidance oi
their drivers ever and again striking
them in the flank with their jambox
and it was strange to see the troop
winding around the hills in marching
order after leaving lattakoo whither
was the expedition going colonel ev-
erest had said straight on and indeed
he and matthcw strux could not yet fol-
low a fixed course vhat they wanted
before commencing their trigonometrical
operations was a vast level plain on
which to establish the base of the first
of the triangles which like a network
were to cover for several degrees the
southern part of africa the colonel
explained to the bushman what he want-
ed and with the calmness of one to
whom scientific language is familiar
talked to him of triangles adjacent
angles hases meridians zenith distances
and the like mokoum let him go for a
few moments then interrupted him with
an impatient movement saying colonel
i dont know anything about your angles
bases and meridians  dont under-
stand even in the least what you are

going to do in the desert but that is
your business you are asking for a
large level plain oh well i can find you
that

  and at his orders the caravan having
just ascended the lattakoo hills turned
down again towards the southwest this
took them rather more to the south of
the village towards the plain watered by
the kuruman and here the bushman ex-
pected to find a suitable place for the
colonels plans from that day he al-
ways took the head of the caravan sir
john murray well mounted never left
him and from time to time the report
of a gun made his colleagues aware that
he was making acquaintance with the af-
rican game the colonel quite absorbed
in contemplating the difficulties of the
expedition let his horse carry him on
matthew strux sometimes on horseback
sometimes in the wagon according to the
nature of the ground seldom opened his
lips nicholas palander as bad a rider
as could be was generally on foot at
other times he shut himself up in his
vehicle and there lost himself in the pro-
foundest mathematical abstractions

  although william emery and michael
zorn occupied separate wagons at night
they were always together when the car-
avan was on the march every day and
every incident of the journey bound
them in a closer friendship from one
stage to another they rode talked and
argued together sometimes they fell
behind the train and sometimes rode on
several miles ahead of it when the plain
extended as far as they could see they
were free here and lost amidst the wild-
ness of nature how they forgot figures
and problems calculations and observa-
tions and chatted of everything but
science they were no longer astron-
omers contemplating the starry firma-
ment but were more like two youths
escaped from school reveling in the
dense forests and boundless plains they


amazing stories

laughed like ordinary mortals both of
them had excellent dispositions open
amiable and devoted forming a strange
contrast to colonel everest and matthew
strux who were formal not to say stiff
these two chiefs were often the subject
of their conversations and emery learnt
a good deal about them from his friend

  yes said michael zorn that day
i watched them well on board the
augusta and i profess to think they are
jealous of each other and if colonel
everest appears to be at the head of
things matthew strux is not less than
his equal the russian government has
clearly established his position one chief
is as imperious as the other and besides

i	tell you again there is the worst of all-
jealousy between them the jealousy of
the learned

  and that for which there is the least
occasion answered emery because in
discoveries everything has its value and
each derives equal benefit but my dear
zorn if as i believe your observa-
tions are correct it is unfortunate for
our expedition in such a work there
ought to be a perfect understanding
no doubt replied zorn and i fear
that understanding does not exist think
of our confusion if every detail the
choice of a base the method of calculat-
ing the position of the stations the ver-
ification of the figures open a fresh dis-
cussion every time unless i am much
mistaken i forebode a vast deal of quib-
bling when we come to compare our reg-
isters and the observations we shall
have made to the minutest fraction
you frighten me said emery it
would be sorrowful to carry an enter-
prise of this kind so far and then to
fail for want of concord let us hope
that your fears may not be realized

  i hope they may not answered the
young russian but i say again i as-
sisted at certain scientific discussions on
the voyage which showed me that both

colonel everest and his rival are un-
deniably obstinate and that at heart there
is a miserable jealousy between them
but these two gentlemen are never
apart observed emery you never
find one without the other

  true replied zorn they are never
apart all day long but then they never
exchange ten words they only keep
watch on each other if one doesnt
manage to annihilate the other we shall
indeed work under deplorable condi-
tions

  and for yourself asked wiliam
hesitatingly which of the two would

you wish-	

  my dear william replied zorn with
much frankness i shall loyally accept
him as chief who can command respect
as such this is a question of science
and i have no prejudice in the matter
matthew strux and the colonel are both
remarkable and worthy men england
and russia should profit equally from
their labors therefore it matters little
whether the work is directed by an
englishman or a russian are you not
of my opinion

  quite answered emery therefore
do not let us be distracted by absurd
prejudices and jet us as far as pos-
sible use our efforts for the common
good perhaps it will be possible to
ward off the blows of the two adver-
saries and besides there is your fel-
low countryman nicholas palander-

  he laughed zorn he will neither
see hear nor comprehend anything he
would make calculations to any extent
but he is neither russian prussian eng-
lish or chinese he is not even an in-
habitant of this sublunary sphere he is
nicholas palander thats all

 i cannot say the same for my
countryman sir john murray said
emery he is a thorough english-
man and a most determined hunter and
he would sooner follow the traces of an
measuring

a meridian



ei -ant and giraffe than give himself
any trouble about a scientific argument
we must therefore depend upon our-
y  s zorn to neutralize the antipathy
between our chiefs whatever happens
we must hold together

  ay whatever happens replied
zorn holding out his hand to his friend

  the bushman still continued to guide
the caravan down toward the south-
west at midday on the th of march
it reached the base of the long wooded
hills which extend from lattakoo mo-
koum was not mistaken he had led the
expedition toward the plain but it was
still undulated and therefore unfitted for
an attempt at triangulation the march
continued uninterrupted and mokoum
rode at the head of the riders and
wagons while sir john murray emery
and zorn pushed on in advance toward
the end of the day they all arrived at a
station occupied by one of the wander-
ing boers or farmers who are in-
duced by the richness of the pasture-
land to make temporary abodes in vari-
ous parts of the country

  the colonist a dutchman and head
of a large family received the colonel
and his companions most hospitably and
would take no remuneration in return
he was one of those brave industrious
men whose slender capital intelligently
employed in the breeding of oxen
cows and goats soon produces a for-
tune when the pasturage is exhausted
the farmer like a patriarch of old seeks
for new springs and fertile prairies
pitching his camp afresh where the
conditions seem favorable

  the farmer opportunely told colonel
everest of a wide plain fifteen miles
away which would be found quite flat
the caravan started early next morning
at daybreak the only incident that
broke the monotory of the long morn-
ing march was sir john murrays tak-
ing a shot at a distance of more than

	yards at a gnu a curious animal
about five feet high with the muzzle of
an ox a long white tail and pointed
horns it fell with a heavy groan much
to the astonishment of the bushman
who was surprised at seeing the animal
struck at such a distance the gnu gen-
erally affords a considerable quantity of
excellent meat and was accordingly in
high esteem among the hunters of the
caravan

  the site indicated by the farmer was
reached about mid-day it was a bound-
less prairie stretching to the north with-
out the slightest undulation no better
spot for measuing a base could be im-
agined and the bushman after a short
investigation returned to colonel ev-
erest with the announcement that they
had reached the place they were seeking

chapter vii

the base of the triangle

the work undertaken by the com-
mission was a triangulation for
the purpose of measuring an arc
of meridian now the direct measure-
ment of one or more degrees by means
of metal rods would be impracticable
in no part of the world is there a region
so vast and unbroken as to admit of so
delicate an operation happily there is
an easier way of proceeding by divid-
ing the region through which the merid-
ian passes into a number of imaginary
triangles whose solution is comparatively
easy

  these triangles are obtained by ob-
serving signals either natural or arti-
ficial such as church-towers posts or
rcverbcratory lamps by means of the
theodolite or repeating-circle every sig-
nal is the vertex of a triangle whose
angles are exactly determined by the in-
struments so that a good observer with a
proper telescope can take the bearings of


amazing stories

any object whatever a tower by day or
a lamp by night sometimes the sides of
the triangles are many miles in length
and when arago connected the coast of
valencia in spain with the baleric
islands one of the sides measured -
 toises when one ide and two
angles of any triangle are known the
other sides and angle may be found
by taking therefore a side of one of
the known triangles for a new base and
by measuring the angles adjacent to
the base new triangles can be success-
fully formed along the whole length of
the arc and since every straight line
in the network of triangles is known the
length of the arc can be easily deter-
mined the values of the sides and
angles may be obtained by the theodolite
and repeating jjde but the first side
the base of the whole system must be
actually measured on the ground and
this operation requires the utmost care

  when delambre and mechain meas-
ured the meridian of france from dun-
kirk to barcelona they took for their
base a straight line  meters in
length in the road from melun to lieu-
saint and they were no less than  days
in measuring it colonel everest and
matthew strux designed proceeding in
the same way and it will be seen how
much precision was necessary

  the work was begun on the th of
march much to the astonishment of the
bochjesmen who could not at all un-
derstand it mokoum thought it strange
for these learned men to measure the
earth with rods six feet long and any-
way he had done his duty they had
asked him for a level plain and he had
found it for them

  the place was certainly well chosen
covered with dry short grass the plain
was perfectly level as far as the horizon
behind lay a line of hills forming the
southern boundary of the kalahari
desert toward the north the plain

seemed boundless to the east the
sides of the table-land of lattakoo dis-
appeared in gentle slopes and in the
west where the ground was lower the
soil became marshy as it imbibed the
stagnant water which fed the affluents
of the kuruman

  i think colonel everest said
strux after he had surveyed the grassy
level that when our base is estab-
lished we shall be able here also to fix
the extremity of our meridian

  likely enough replied the colonel
we must find out too whether the
arc meets with any obstacles that may
impede the survey let us measure the
base and we will decide afterward
whether it will be better to join it by a
series of auxiliary triangles to those
which the arc must cross

  they thus resolved to proceed to the
measurement of the base it would be
a long operation for they wanted to ob-
tain even more correct results than those
obtained by the french philosophers at
melun this would be a matter of some
difficulty since when a new base was
measured afterward near pepignan to
verify the calculations there was only
an error of  inches in a distance of

	toises  feet tj

  orders were given for encamping anj
a bochjesman village a kind of kraal
was formed on the plain the wagons
were arranged in a circle the english
and russian flags floating over their
respective quarters the center was
common ground the horses and buf-
faloes which by day grazed outside were
driven in by night to the interior to
save them from attacks of the wild
beasts around

  mokoum took upon himself to arrange
the hunting expedition for revictualing
and sir john murray whose presence
was not indispensable in the measure-
ment of the base looked after the pro-
visions and served out the rations of
measuring a meridian



preserved meat and fresh venison
thanks to the skill and experience of
mokoum and his companions game was
never wanting they scoured the dis-
trict for miles around and the report
of their guns resounded at all hours

  the survey began on the next day
zorn and emery being charged with the
preliminaries

  come along said zorn and good
luck be with us

  the primary operation consisted in
tracing a line on the ground where it
was especially level this chanced to be
from the s e to n w and pickets
being placed at short intervals to mark
the direction zorn carefully verified the
correctness of their position by means
of the cross wires of his telescope for
more than eight miles the proposed
length of the base was the measurement
continued and the young men performed
their work with scrupulous fidelity

  the next step was to adjust the rods
for the actual measurement apparently
a very simple operation but which in
fact demands the most continuous cau-
tion as the success of a triangulation in
a great measure is contingent on its pre-
ciseness

  on the morning of the th twelve
wooden pedestals were planted along the
line securely fastened in their position
and prepared to support the rods col-
onel everest and matthew strux as-
sisted by their young coadjutors placed
their rods in position and nicholas pal-
ander stood ready pencil in hand to
write down in a double register the fig-
ures transmitted to him

  the rods employed were six in num-
ber and exactly two toises in length
they were made of platinum as being
under ordinary circumstances unaf-
fected by any condition of the atmos-
phere in order however to provide
against any change of temperature each
was covered with a rod of copper some-

what shorter than itself and a micro-
scopic vernier was attached to indicate
any contraction or expansion that might
occur the rods were next placed
lengthwise with a small interval between
each in order to avoid the slight shock
which might result from immediate con-
tact colonel everest and matthew strux
with their own hands placed the first
rod about a hundred toises farther
on they had marked a point of sight
and as the rods were each provided with
iron projections it was not difficult to
place them exactly in the proper direc-
tion emery and zorn lying on the
ground saw that the projection stood
exactly in the middle of the sight

  now said colonel everest we
must define our exact starting point we
will drop a line from the end of our
first rod and the will definitely mark the
extremity of our base

  yes answered strux but ye must
take into account the radius of the line
of course said the colonel

  the starting-point determined the
work went on the next proceeding
was to determine the inclination of the
base with the horizon

  we do not i believe pretend said
colonel everest  to place the rod in
a position which is perfectly horizontal
no answered strux it is enough
to find the angle which each rod makes
with the horizon and we can then deduce
the true inclination

  thus agreed they proceeded with
their observations employing their spirit-
level and testing every result by the
vernier as palander was about to in-
scribe the record strux requested that
the level should be reversed in order
that by the division of the two regis-
ters a closer approximation to truth
might be attained this mode of double
observation was continued throughout
the operations

  two important points were now ob-


amazing stories

tained the direction of the rod with re-
gard to the base and the angle which it
made with the horizon the results
were inscribed in two registers and
signed by the members of the commis-
sion

  there were still two further observa-
tions no less important to be made the
variation of the rod caused by differ-
ences of temperature and the exact dis-
tance measured by it the former was
easily determined by comparing the dif-
ference in length between the platinum
and copper rods the microscope gave
the variation of the platinum and this
was entered in the double register to be
afterward reduced to  centigrade

  they had now to observe the distance
actually measured to obtain this re-
sult it was necessary to place the sec-
ond rod at the end of the first leaving
a small space between them when the
second rod was adjusted with the same
care as the former it only remained to
measure the interval between the two
a small plate of platinum known as a
slider was attached to the end of the
platinum bar that was not covered by
the copper and this colonel everest
slipped gently along until it touched the
next rod the slider was marked off
into ths of a toise and as a
vernier with its microscope gave the
ths the space could be very ac-
curately determined the result was im-
mediately registered

  michael zorn considering that the
covered platinum might be sooner af-
fected by heat than the uncovered cop-
per suggested another precaution ac-
cordingly they erected a small awning
to protect the rod from the suns rays

  for more than a month were these
minutiae patiently carried on as soon
as four bars were adjusted and the
requisite observations complete the last
of the rods was carried to the front
it was impossible to measure more than

 to  toises a day and sometimes
when wind was violent operations were
altogether suspended

  every evening about three-quarters
of an hour before it became too dark to
read the verniers they left off work
after taking various anxious precautions
they brought forward temporarily the
rod no  and marked the point of
its termination here they made a hole
and drove in a stake with a leaden plate
attached they then replaced no
in its original position after observing
the inclination the thermometric varia-
tion and the direction they noted the
prolongation measured by rod no 
and then with a plumb-line touching the
foremost end of rod no  they made
a mark on the leaden plate they care-
fully traced through this point two lines
at right angles one signifying the base
the other the perpendicular the plate
was then covered with a wooden lid
the hole filled in and the stake left
buried till the morning thus if any
accident had occurred to their apparatus
during the night they would not be
obliged to begin afresh the next day
the plate was uncovered and rod no
 replaced in the same position as on
the evening before by means of the
plumb-line whose point ought to fall
exactly on the point intersected by two
straight lines

  these operations were carried on for
thirty-eight days along the plain and
every figure was registered doubly and
verified compared and approved by
each member of the commission

  few discussions arose between colonel
everest and fiis russian colleague and
if sometimes the smallest fraction of a
toise gave occasion for some polite cav-
ilings they always yielded to the opinion
of the majority one question alone
called for the intervention of sir john
murray this was about the length
of the base it was certain that the
measuring a meridian



longer the base the easier would be the
measurement of the opposite angle col-
onel everest proposed  toises
nearly the same as the base measured at
melun but matthew strux wished that
it should be  toises since the
ground permitted colonel everest
however remained firm and strux
seemed equally determined not to yield
after a few plausible arguments per-
sonalities began they were no longer
two astronomers but an englishman and
a russian happily the debate was in-
terrupted by some days of bad weather

which allowed their tempers to cool it
was subsequently decided by the major-
ity that they should split the difference
and assign  toises as the measure-
ment of the base the work was at
length completed any error which oc-
curred in spite of their extreme pre-
cision might be afterward corrected by
measuring a new base from the northern
extremity of the meridian

  the base measured exactly 
toises

  and upon this they were now to start
their series of triangles

jules verne

    the author of measuring a meridian won an enduring fame for his
stories devoted to science fiction he was among the first writers in this
field and gave it a dignity by the length of his narrations as well as by
their scientific basis he was born february   in the city of nantes
where his memory is preserved as one of the glories of the quiet little
breton city he went to paris to study law but his genius for literature
appeared in the writing of librettos for two operas when he was about
twenty years old and a couple of years later he collaborated with the
younger dumas on a comedy in verse he wrote some stories of traveling
adventure and these started him on his career he is considered a pioneer
in fiction travel stories his science fiction story five weeks in a balloon
is considered his first success in this type of romance it appeared in 
he made his home in amiens where lie died on march   the love
motif was kept under successfully in his works it may be noted that our
readers sometimes made their protest against this topic appearing in our
stories

    he was a member of the legion of honor and several of his works
were crowned by the french academy it is interesting to realize that
while he was writing the greatest developments in science and engineering
were at their heights

    his monument emblem of his immortality is depictcd on our cover

  there seems to be a decided depression in
science fiction also only one book really worth
considering lias come out the english version
of fpl docs not reply

  this is the book from which the film fpl
was made which i reviewed in our february
issue the book is a very interesting technical
romance describing in great detail the con-
struction of the first floating platform said
platform is to be anchored in niid-atlantic be-
tween bermuda and the azores and it is de-
signed as a combination airport-hotel-restaur-
ant-fuel station-repair shop in other words
a floating tempclhofer field there is plenty
of excitement in the story-sabotage-fights-
gassing of the entire crew and the rescue in
the usual nick of time the platform is also
saved from sinking by the finding of the miss-
ing valve-parts so that the pumps can eject the
thousands of tons of water which the saboteurs
lioped would sink the platform there is also
a sort of sketchy romance appearing in the
story-the love of bernhard droste the de-
signer and gisela lennartz the beautiful-
naturally daughter of the ship builder

  i have one serious fault to find with the
book the action jumps from bremen to the
platform and other places with disconcerting
rapidity and disturbing frequency this is the
usual fault with german publications

  nevertheless fpl is worth while reading

notes on moving and talking
pictures

  several years ago s fowler wright wrote
a book called the deluge depicting the swift
destruction and slow rebuilding of civilization
in the book the chief action takes place in
england and it was strongly reminiscent of the
people of the ruins by shanks and the
doomsmen by sutphen the book itself wa
not so very interesting it was written in the
wells manner-yet it drags along an un-
ending mass of detail and ending practically
nowhere the feeble plot lying on the wayside
from lack of momentum in the visualization
the feebleness of the plot is well sustained but
the change of scene from england to america
is much to the better since it is far more im-
pressive o see new york devoured by a tidal
wave than even the rapid inundation of an
english countryside

  the destruction of new york is exceedingly
well done quite realistic and plausible and
well worth the price of admission aside from
this the story winds up in a gang-fight from
which the better element emerges triumphant

the invisible man by herbert george wells
  -adapted for the screen by r c sherriff and
  produced by universal

  congratulations universal you have done
well no fault can be found with any and all the
changes made in the story since the end
justifies the means and the invisible man
is as perfect a film as could be wished for

  our readers are probably familiar with the
story but here is a short synopsis for those who
are not

  a research chemist discovers a way of mak-
ing himself invisible unable to discover ways
and means of becoming visible again he goes
mad he then decides to become emperor of
the world institutes a reign of terror but is
finally killed by the authorities the invisible
man is depicted on the screen by claude rains
who plays a very difficult role and whose face
is visible only in the end as he is dying the
eerie atmosphere which this film calls for is
excellently sustained throughout the uncanni-
ness of the various scenes is marvelously con-
vincing and the various humorous situations
dont degenerate into slap-stick comedy mr
james whale who directed the picture and his
staff of technicians who must have labored
mightily to produoe the invisible effects have
done a wonderful job	c a brandt

editor amazing stories

 the cover of the march amazing stories
was a masterpiece morey at his best all of
moreys covers lately have been exceptionally
good keep up the good work morey

  the editorial was very good dr sloanes
editorials are always interesting his style is
very good and i see no reasons why he shouldnt
contribute a few stories to our mag what
about it ed

  now for the stories in peril among the
drivers the plot could not be exactly called
hackneyed because ive read many a story deal-
ing with ants their tife etc but never such a
method of penetration to reach and observe
them one question i would like to ask in
comparison which ego is larger the human
one or the insect one if the human one is
larger how could it get into the small body
of an insect or is it just a manifestation
which animates inanimate bodies which can-
not be measured or judged in terrestrial
standards of-physical measurement please en-
lighten me

  let me say in conclusion that the story was
darn good a combination of excellent writing
with good science and plenty of action lets
hear more from bob olsen

 the man who stopped the earth and
a job of blending were both short and ex-
tremely good a few short stories are al-
ways welcome for they provide the much
needed variety

  when i say variety i mean in contrast to
the two gigantic serials running currently i
expect literally a perfect april issue with the
two serials coming to bang-up conclusions

  the reprints are all welcome exccpt the
first one which appeared before in an early
issue of amazinc stories now i have no
enmity against that perfectly good story ex-
cept that it was printed before in as

  the reason why i dislike reprints that have
appeared before in as is because i save my
copies and i can easily dig up the number it
appeared in and read the story if i so desire
so you see its a waste of perfectly good read-
ing space thank heavens all the other re-
prints didnt appear in our mag continue
to follow this policy and youll get my support

 the bit of information about the corona
of the sun was very interesting and hints about

  the question you ask in this letter about the
personality of ants if it is compared to that
of human beings is pretty nearly unanswerable
the ego is not a material entity as usually un-
derstood the instincts of an ant seem to
drive him to endless activity but we do not
believe that nra and other letters of the
alphabet backed up by the federal govern-
ment will ever make man proportionately as
active as the ant-editor

an encouraging letter from an english
reader who seems to like dr

editor amazing stories 

  i feel i must write and congratulate neil
r jones upon his consistently entertaining and
thought-provoking professor jameson series
all of them have been excellent but times
mausoleum in my opinion outdid all thepred-
ecessors-not so much in scientific value but
in the manner in which it was written may
your shadow never grow less mr jones

  by the way what has happened to leslie f
stone these days she wrote the story which
i shall forever privately classify as a superb
masterpiece-the man who bought a fly
since then ive seen nothing of her work
after such a gem in miniature i expected some-
thing else but no come come mr editor
where has she got to

  doctor smith is indeed refreshing ill his
triplanetary-although so far ive only got
to the end of part ii one can rely on him
for a relief from the only too frequent prosaic
hero and villain-great ynung hero dazzlingly
beautiful wife and bold bad villain proved
completely mad in the finish of course
thank goodness the great doctor provides as
ever understandable and even lovable people
complete with slang-oh i forgot that mat-
ter is closed isnt it not for worlds would
i restart it

  amazing in its new jacket is certainly
more convenient to handle but oh dear the
rough edges why not bring along one of
doctor smiths zones of force and slice all the
edges monthly en masse im sure hed oblige
if doc seaton isnt too busy thinking up some-

the contents are all right so the edges can
take care of themselves still dont you think
it would lend a better appearance

  your cover drawings are al leo morey
seems to be rapidly approaching the skill of

readers rave perhaps if said readers had the
task to do themselves theyd say less and think
more

tions for what he has done leslie f stone
will soon make her appcarance on our pages
there is no danger of losing her from the
list of those whom we consider our staff
writers the old size of amazing stories al-
ways seemed rather awkward and the vast ma-
jority of magazines now conform to ours in
their format or size a criticism from an
author has a special value and it is always
of interest to see how our work affects our
neighbors across the ocean-editor

a letter from england-a question about
correspondents of the fair sex

editor amazing stories

  there is no mistaking your exceptional maga-
zine with its latest cover-quite in keeping with
the enthralling stories under it-and then the
cover design is progressive as well it is unique
and very modern and there is the secret
of the success of your paper

  should you have the opportunity to publish
my name and address somewhere in your
columns  should esteem it a great favor as 
would very much like to exchange ideas and
views with readers on your side of the world
needless to say i shall be pleased to answer
all letters-my age is  years and i occupy a
position as cleric in wholesale wine mer-
chants

  may i ask if you have many feminine read-
ers as very rarely do i see letters from the
opposite sex in your columns and yet i feel
sure that many are interested in progression
as supported by your pages

  wishing you every success

a letter from an australian reader who
would like to have some correspondents

editor amazing stories

  would you please intimate to the readers
of your magazine the fact that away in an
outlandish part of australia there is a young
fellow who is just pining away for a few friends
with whom he can discuss various problems in
science and chemistry

  when i get talking space ships and ray
guns etc round these parts my audience
shakes its head knowingly and mutters its pity

  i do admit that every spare coin i get goes
into scientific apparatus so i suppose i must
be a crank

  however i know that somewhere there must
be an understanding heart perhaps there are
several if there are i would be more than de-
lighted to correspond with them either sex
i also want to tell you how much i appreciate
your magazine it is my one consolation

a theory of atomic cohesion by one of
our author

editor amazing stories

  during recent years the classical theories re-
garding the structure of matter have been re-
placed by the atomic theories expounded by
heisenberg a h compton davisson and
germer g p thomson dempster de broglie
schroedinger and others ttiese theories all
agree in the general statement that the atom is
composed of protons and electrons the elec-
tron is really a particle of negative electricity
rather than an electrified particle and the
proton a particle of positive electricity the
charge of the proton equals that of the electron
therefore the particles are held together by
electrical forces

  how are these forces generated that has
always been the stumbling block the unknown
quantity in permitting us to progress beyond a
certain point in our study of energy and mat-
ter we do not know what electricity is but
we know how it manifests itself according
to my theory that part of the cosmic world
which we might call the ether for want of a
better word is an intensively charged magnetic
field how is it charged that is another
unknown quantity but for our purpose let us
assume that this is the case then into this
powerful magnetic field radiation waves of
energy are projected at high speed what is
may 

amazing

stories



the result these waves through magnetic
induction become particles of negative and posi-
tive electricity which are actually the electrons
and protons composing the atom then these
charges revolve around one another and w-e
have an atom of hydrogen thus matter is
born other combinations of electrons and
protons give us other elements

  therefore for the creation of matter two
things must be available-a magnetic field and
the movement of what we can call radiation
waves across this field the converse of this
should then be true-when movement of mat-
ter through a magnetic field ceases atoms will
be annihilated therefore as told in my story
were the earth to stop suddenly it would dis-
integrate instantly into insubstantial radiation

  cosmic rays coming from the depths of inter-
stellar space probably represent the conversion
of matter into energy hence they indicate that
the material universe is continuously dissolving
into radiation as advanced by jeans or ac-
cording to millikans view these rays are the
evidence of the birth and growth of matter

  while i realize that professional physicists
may smile with superior disdain at a theory
such as this can they disprove it

  we have published some very good material
by the writer of this letter and now that so
many scientists are engrossed in the study of
the atom we believe that mr kostkos theory
will be found very interesting to our readers-

the work of artists criticised and compared

editor amazikc stories

  i am simply delighted with the december
issue of amazing stories the stories were
all fine works of fiction i am very glad to
see a story by otis adelbert kline in our
magazine times mausoleum by neil r
jones had fragments of nearly every story he
has written in it which made it all the more
interesting all the stories demand a great
deal of praise

  and now to get down to the cover morey
painted two of the most terrible covers f have
ever seen for the october and november issues
 thought he would never return to the old
standard that he set in the winter of  in-
cidentally the four best covers morey ever
painted for amazing stories were on the
april  may  winter  quarterly
and the spring-summer  quarterly but
when i saw the december  cover  knew
that morey was at last beginning to hit his old
stride again please do not put sigmond on
the covers again please dont put paul on the
covers again but please pul wesso the un-
crowned king of stf artists on the covers
every other month and let muller do some of

the illustrations morey is doing very well at
present but the other artists mentioned will
add variety

  incidentally editor what happened to our
quarterly     huh all right dont
shoot ill go back to my hole

                           philadelphia pa

  you should realize that in the design on our
cover more has to be thought of than the
purely artistic element they are designed to
attract attention so that the features of them
which you consider defective from the stand-
point of art may be of value from the stand-
point of attracting attention to the magazine
it is a long while since mr wesso has done
any work lor us-editor

the number of stories we have published
by five popular authors

editor amazing stories

  i will start this letter off by complimenting
morey on his wonderful covcr on this issue-
december i think bob olsens story takes
first place in this issue as far as i am con-
cerned with neil r jones and dr m j
breuer taking second and third places why
oh why cant we get a sequel to williamsons
the stone from the green star ill keep
yelling until we get it or until i get so old
that i cant hold this pen up any longer so
you might as well give it to us the way i
understood it the story was supposed to have
a sequel in the story a vision of futurity
williamson is undoubtedly one of the greatest
of science fiction authors alive i noticed in
going through your magazine since i started
reading it back in the days of vol  no 
 which was october that h vincent has
had more stories published he has had eight
with j lewis burtt second with seven and
bob olsen and dr keller and neil r jones
with six apiece well i will close waiting
patiently for the next issue

of your letter we can only say that we
regard it as very encouraging for the editor
because on him falls the selection of authors
and stories and while he wants to please the
readers he also wishes to keep the magazine
up to a high standard of literature so you can
see why such letters as yours are appreciated

  a letter from a ten-year-old reader

            of amazinc stories
editor amazing stories

  i am only  years old but i have been
reading amazing stories for quite a while
the first time was some old copy the one with
the stone from the green star in it onc


amazing

stories

may 

or twice the newsstand that i get my reading
material from would have a copy and by harp-
ing on it someone might buy it ior me

  then in may  i started taking it regu-
larly until this summer wc moved down to
cape cod where they only had it once in a
while here the drug store has all the good
magazines

  unlike other readers i think the larger size
was better when you had the larger size
they put it where you could see it now they
put it down with the s  and  cent trash
another thing when in the larger size it looked
bigger now people see stuff that is thinner
but the same width selling for  cents and
they think they arent getting their moneys
worth

  among the best stories in the last seven
months were the death drum by a hyatt
verrill and the meteor-men of plaa by
henry j kostkos

  this letter is quite a remarkable production
for a boy of ten years of age we have always
been much interested in our juvenile readers
and in an early issue we even printed the por-
trait of one whom we supposed to be the
youngest reader of the magazine the stories
you have picked out in your last paragraph
deserve all you say about them-editor

a nice letter from  nice boy

editor amazing stories

  while only now a boy in high school i
have been a reader of all scientific fiction maga-
zines ever since ive been old enough to under-
stand and appreciate the smallest part of any
of the stories although  did not start saving
these magazines until recently i am making up
for this neglect by buying back issues

  the stories in the fairly recent issues of
your magazine that i like best are as follows

  	the meteor-men of plaa by henry kost-
kos

  	the essence of life by f pragnell

  	children of the great magma by walter
kateley

  	theft of the washington monument by
robert arthur jr

  	into the hydrosphere by neil r jones
here i would ask a question have there been
stories preceding this one by the same author
and the same characters it seems as if i
have read stories like this before

  	the whisper of death by harl vincent

  	the battery of hate by j w campbell
jr-

  	when the universe shrank by j l
burtt

  in the spring quarterly  there was an
excellent story by j w campbell that i con-
sider one of his best islands of space

  lets have more and more of harl vincent
and j w campbell jr

reader and we must say that he has made a
very good selection of the stories which he en-
joyed your question about into the hydro-

a short letter from england where we
have many appreciative friends

editor amazing stories

  i am a regular reader of your books and i
think they are swell that is of course when i
can get them there are no shops near where
i live that sell them and i have to go around
all the markets and second-hand bookshops till
i can find them and theyre about six months
old when i do finally get them now to come
down to brass tacks

  could you find a reader to write to me
someone about my own age  male or female
female preferred

  i have always wanted to write to you and
thank you for the good work you are doing
but up to now i have always found something
stopping me

  i work in the local railway and have been
reading your books for the last three years
some of my friends are always pulling my leg
about them and the arguments last for hours
but i am slowly getting them round to my way
of thinking

  hoping to hear from you soon and wishing
your magazine the very best of luck i remain

  have you ever tried to get amazing stories
from the woolworth company they supply
them to english readers we hope that your
letter will get you a correspondent there is
quite a demand among our readers for what
we may suppose to be kindred souls who will
be ready to open correspondence with them but
we have never heard of the results of their
requests-editor 

an interesting and suggestive letter

editor amazing stories

  this is the first time since the amazing
stories magazine came out that  venture to
express my feelings and emotions what is the
big idea of cutting down the size of our maga-
zine and changing the title design to the com-
mon type title of the present issue  neednt
say more

  as to the stories theres no doubt about
them being some of the finest literature we can
get though i prefer the more down to earth
may

stories



stories to the interplanetary such as we used
to have in the old issues ie the island of
dr moreau high tension mr fosdiek
and hicks and the detective stories the
other type of stories are too good and interest-
ing for me to criticise as to the illustrations
there is no doubt about mr morey being an
artist in its full sense but why doesnt he try
to make his drawings more clear and precise
with more of the exact scientific appearance
art is my trade or profession but i wouldnt
criticize mr moreys knowledge of art

  i missed quite a few of the numbers since
they were stopped from coming into canada
but now i have picked them right up again
i still possess about thirty back numbers be-
ginning with vol  no  which i wouldnt
part with for the world

  well heres hoping our magazine gets back
to iti original shape

  a good test of the value of a letter for our
correspondence columns is when it suggests a
course of action to the editor the inter-
planetary stories are great favorites with so
many of our readers that we are really inclined
to believe that we are favoring perhaps a
majority by publishing the same the stories
you name are very good ones and you will
find that in an early next issue there will be
more of the type which you prefer this will
he after the two interplanetary stories are fin-
ished we now have the canada question
settled we believe to the satisfaction of our
canadian readers-editor

an old time scicacc fiction organization
asks for members

editor amazing stories

  well here we are or should i say here i
am well any way here is what the hundreds
of thousands of readers of science-fiction have
been waiting for what wait until i get to it

  i want to ask you mr editor to please print
this in your discussions department

  now as to what i have for the readers i
am not going to use the hack works of
something new or something unique
for it is not i mankind has had such things as
the thing i am going to tell you about

  it is an organization for all the true lovers
of science-fiction it is called the inter-
national science-fiction guild further it has
been in existence for over twenty-five years-
under a different name up until 

  this is an organization that is as different
from any other as this magazine is different
from the general run of western detective and
so-forth magazines

  to prove this rather strange statement
there is only one thing that you have to have
to become a member oi this organization that
is a love for science-fiction

  that and the persons name complete ad-
dress sex age and the kind of science-fiction
he or she likes best this and a three cent stamp
to cover cost of mailing will make you a life
member of this organization will bring you a
complete detailed booklet giving full informa-
tion about this organization will bring you a
membership card will bring to you the full and
beneficial help of this organization

  send the above information to the undersigned
at once

  to get what they want the readers and lovers
of science-fiction must organize

  remember write and remember that this is
a personal letter to each and every one of you
as a reader of this magazine we could not have
sent each of you a personal letter on account
of the cost of postage and therefore we have
taken this means to place this proposition before
every reader of this magazine

  we thank you mr editor

  and wish the very best of luck to your won-
derful magazine 

  address all letters to-

                       wilson shepherd

  the international science-fiction guild
                         oak man alabama

  the organization to which this letter refers
we imagine is quite characteristic being de-
signed for lovers of science-fiction which now
is attaining a wider and wider spread we can
only hope that this letter which we take great
pleasure in publishing will go to increase the
membership in your very interesting society-

an admirer of posi and nega would like
a little more science but loves them
still

editor amazing stories

  i have been a constant reader of amazing
stories since early  and later of your sister
magazine wonder stories

  so much that has appeared within our mags
pages has been of the very highest quality and
the gifted authors have well earned both re-
spect for their knowledge and admiration for
the way they have presented their various
sciences

  the love life and adventures of posi and
nega are quite a treat and also original mr
skidmore made these infinitesimals so human
in their emotions and ambitions and if posi
had aired his knowledge a little more i would
have been still more greatly delighted how-
ever he is such a dear little fellow even though
lie does aim high i would like to keep in touch
with him and his proud little consort

  we thank you for this letter and we are
sure that mr skidmore will be delighted to see

managed to inspire the dramatis persona with
much human nature we have certainly en-
joyed reading them before they went to the
printer-editor

an appreciation from a reader who under-
estimates his own good qualities

editor amazing stories

  i sure do hope two things in regard to this
letter its my first by the way number one
is that you will print it and the second is that
you will soon print the skylark stories i have
been an amazing stories reader for quite some
time and i sure liave enjoyed most of the stories
immensely i liked into the hydrosphere
by neil jones quite as well as any story that
i have read lately and also enjoyed the tree
terror the supermen the theft of the
washington monument and the story when
the universe shrank

  as for the diamond lens i thought it
was terrible and would appreciate it very much
if stories like that would be kept out of our
magazine may i call it our

   i have just finished the january issue of our
magazine again and found it for the most
part very good i have taken immediate liking
for triplanetary by edward smith and also
will give joe skidmore a big hand for the
adventures of posi and nega to tell you
the truth i think that amazinc stories could
get along swell without stories like the
alchemy of ian bjornsin and the atom
smasher the lost language was in my
opinion good but i would rather read stories
about interplanetary travel so you see how i
disagree with j l burt of leland mississippi
heres hoping to see my very humble and mis-
spelled missive in a future issue of your most
magnificent wonderful magazine hope you
wont think it is all flattery because when dad
has a flatery or is it just flat anyway it has
to do with a car he gets awfully mad

that kind-hearted readers will send me

  this letter speaks for itself an editor is
to be congratulated when he gets letters like
this especially when so large a portion of his
correspondence is of this type and when the
unfavorable criticisms are comparatively few
sometimes in our modesty we feel that the
writers of these letters are perhaps too in-
dulgent our readers may be sure of one thing
and that is that we have some excellent writers
who do so much for us that we always think
of them as being staff-writers although they
have really no direct connection with the maga-
zine whatever your tribute to your fathers

unknown languages of children

editor amazing stories

  i have just read the lost language by
dr david h keller it is an excellent story
and one of the best he has ever written i am
moved to write you because of something i
remembered while reading it i looked back
amongst my large collection of odd newspaper
clippings and found a positive verification of this
story

  in october  a letter was printed in
the new york sun by robert a nelson it
is so interesting that i will repeat it almost
complete here it is

  it so happens that i am one of twin broth-
ers  years old as in the case of a twin
it is a matter of record in my family that
when my brother and i first started to talk
and until w were well past six we conversed
with each other in a strange tongue of our
own my mother says that my elder brother
now thirty-two was the only person who could
understand our conversation my father who
specializes in interpreting was unable to relate
our mysterious tongue to that of any other
known language

  i myself remember very well my conversing
with my brother in our odd tongue but i am
unable to remember any specific words with the
exception of two they are fi-fee short i
and fa-fa short a meaning respectively
frederick and robert when my brother
and i were six years old we started school
at that time our knowledge of english was
very little if any however after a year of
schooling and association with other children
we finally discarded use of our strange tongue
it appears that truth is stranger than fiction

i doubt if dr keller would have dared to put
all the details of that letter in his story that
would be stretching it too far i wonder now
if this is not one of the rare clues to the
mystery of where the soul came from could
this language be one carried over from a
previous existence on another sphere or is it
merely  inherited memory either one
sounds impossible yet-explain it any other
way

a canadian who enjoys our efforts and
wants to have a correspondence with
others on science fiction
editor amazing stories

  what no letters in the winter  quar-
terly if it had not been for this it would
have been a perfcct issue my opinion of the
stories are as follows

  the second deluge by garret p serviss
was truly a masterpiece noah would have been
surprised had he been on cosmo versals ark
there is a man in washington who has built
an ark for the next flood which he expects
soon he wont have to wait much longer if it
rains here much more

  a winter amid the ice by jules verne
was good commander byrd intends to explore
the south pole during the summer time he
would never think of doing it in the winter

  the menace by dr keller was by far the
best of his stories what is he going to do about
the taine stories now taine is now an
old man a story which never received its just
due was a voice across the years which
appeared in the winter  quarterly

  i went into the library to get a couple of
iwiks on astronomy and physics thinking that
i could get some information but no-all i
found in the books was what i had read some
time in amazing stories

  we have here another canadian letter in
which our magazine is treated very nicely we
are glad to read what you say about dr
keller our hope is that amazing stories will
get better from year to year but in spite of the
efforts of our brain trusts in washington the
business world is not picking up as fast as we
would like it to when ones whole heart is in
the development of a subject the waiting for
times to change is a very severe trial-editor

note of a supposed error in it from an
english reader
editor amazing stories

  i want to thank you for publishing my letter
in the february issue which i received four
days ago

  regarding the -tones in the last four issues
they have all been good except for the two
poe reprints and the verne reprint i dont
like these two authors myself and i would like
to see rather more modem reprints but still i
dont want to try and forcc my opinion down
your throat

  i expected a lot of dr e e smith after

reading discussions about him and my ex-
pectations were realized to the fullest in tri-
planetary

  in the december issue i was glad to see an-
other professor jameson story and another
story by bob olsen

  i was happy to see that two serials are now
running in the magazine and both tip-toppers
in the january issue you said terror out of
space was by j m walsh but in the febru-
ary issue it says h haverstock hill who
is the author

  i obtained the quarterly about a week ago
what i said before about verne holds good for
a winter amid the ice i didnt like it the
second deluge was all i expected after read-
ing letters about old stories its great so is
doctor kellers story the menace why only
 pages and no discussions in the quarter-
ly it was too small for the price charged in
this country

  i was glad to sec the talkie reviews as well
as the book reviews in the latest issue i saw

f	p  about six months ago

  one of our english newspapers recently pub-
lished a science-fiction story as a serial and i
think this goes to show that this type of story
is growing in popularity among the general
public in this country and several authorities
have said that spare-flying is a possibility do
you really disbelieve it is possible or is it an
attempt to gain notoriety when it does come

  yours until space-flying is a fact and after

                 philip s hetherington
                    tycooly southwaite
                    carlisle cum england

  the two names you cite refer to the same
person one is a nom de plume this has oc-
casioned a slight confusion in your mind in
america a very great success has been attained
by some novels of the same type as the stories
which we publish and it is interesting to find
england following in our footsteps dr keller
the author of the menace is a typical ameri-
can and is attaining a high reputation as a
writer of stories in writing for us of course
he is supposed to give a scientific touch to them
to get stories of this type we have found is
not an easy thing in anything the writer of
these lines may say about space-flying or the
expression of any views relating thereto noto-
riety certainly does not enter into the cal-
culation there would be no glory in refusing
to believe in space traveling and then to have
someone go off and do it personally we do not
believe in its possibility-editor

a very pleasant letter from an english
correspondent

editor amazing stories

  i first started reading a s when i picked
up a copy in a second hand book store in
toronto canada in october  when i
emigrated to that country


amazing

stories

may 

  since then i have taken such a liking to
the old mag that after i left canada where
i ordered it regularly from a book store in bay
street toronto i have had it as regularly as
possible gradually building up a sequence of
numbers for you see in this little hick town
of ours it is only possible to get it occasionally
from second hand book stores and  usually
leave off the reading of a serial until i have it
complete

  i have before me now a copy of the spring
edition quarterly of  and the story that
particularly took my fancy was moon people
of jupiter isaac r nathanson also i liked
suicide durkces last ride by neil r jones
in the september  issue

  i am afraid that is going back rather a long
way but that shows how up to date i am

  say ed old chap why cant youse ding-
fuzzled guys put a few more pictures in the old
book  it sure would be appreciated i guess by
heck it would and what about some more
interplanetary issues

  being a bit of a thinker none the less no
scientist mind you but still keenly interested in
scientifiction i have often wondered why sup-
posing we regard gravitation as a potential cur-
rent of negative electricity attracting matter to
earth why cannot a ship be built to discharge a
positive current at the earth thus reversing
gravitys action unlike poles repelling you
know

  say ed if you print this letter i wonder if
any of your readers would care to send me
some old quarterlies or monthlies in return for
which i could send them some english mags

  and say do you think you could be a pal
a regular pal and send me some used american
or foreign stamps in return for which i will
recommend your wonderful little mag to all
my book loving friends and try and persuade
them to place a regular order if you will tell
me where to do so anyhow the mag itself
will do the recommending even now i have
about  different copies which i regularly lend
out all for the good of the paper you know

a reader for life

                       	baker street
                       ipswich
                       suffolk england

  it is interesting to note the fact that wc get
a number of letters from english readers and
they always seem to like our work the same
applies to australia new zealand and canada
as a rule but the scol jings come from readers
in this country letters like the above may be
said to speak for themselves but they certainly
are a great pleasure indicating that our efforts
have really succeeded in eliciting results it
seems perfectly obvious that a trip of a quarter
of a million miles through what is virtually
airless space and landing on an airless water-
less globe with the great troubles of accelera-

tion and deceleration would try anybodys soul
and as regards interplanetary travel where
distances are measured by light years it seems
preposterous to imagine that the events so pic-
turesquely described in our stories will ever
come to pass unlike poles do not repel-they
attract each other it is like poles which
repel-editor

  a letter of characteristic and rather
personal criticism
editor amazing stories

  the january and february issues of a s
were excellent the stories were very good
and i think the cover illustrations were very
attractive

  there is just one thing i dont like and it is
this why do you print those old stories by
wells poe etc i think the majority of readers
of a s have read most of the stories by these
men i know i have and if i should ever wish
to read them again all i have to do is go to
the nearest library and read them free of
charge and still you waste valuable space and
our money by printing them

  and when wc ask ydu in the most polite man-
ner to reprint the skylark stories you reply
we dont make a practice of reprinting stories
or we are not able to promise an early re-
print and then you turn about and contradict
yourself by reprinting one of poes nightmares
which most of us can recite word for word by
memory

  when i looked through the february issue
and saw a story by poe well that just spoiled
my day i started foaming at the mouth and
i danced the newest version of the st vitus
dance

  if you have so many stories on hand then
please print them

  the discussions are very interesting but
lately it is getting a little stale i dont mean
the letters i mean the editors answers please
mr editor think up some new cxcuses those
old ones are practically used up

  well i think that is about all

  and dont try to give me any of your phony
cxcuses ive been reading amazing stories so
long that i feel like some sort of an authority
on a s so dont try to soft soap me

  p s-no im not one of the boston raw-
sons

  we put this letter into our discussions to
show our readers what it is our fate to en-
counter in the way of severe criticism there
are a great many things which have to be con-
sidered in making up a magazine wc would
suggest that you would show a higher literary
appreciation if you would not call poes stories
nightmares what you call excuses arc not
intended as such you should consider them
may 

amazing stories



simply statements of fact the editors re-
marks on the letters are short and it would be
a simple matter for the reader to pass them
over and read the letters which in one sense
or another are always interesting comments
on the letters are not excuses-editor

the possibility of going to the moon bob
olsen and his stories

editor amazing stories

  once many months ago i used to get a real
thrill out of imagining a voyage to the moon
slowly i began to believe such a thing possi-
ble but now my hopes have been shattered on
a cruel rock doctor sloane the ed of as
has firmly denounced the possibility of such a
trip alas i begin to reason with the editor
why should man fail in the attempt to reach
the moon the old wail usually raised by a
lot of sceptical people is it would take a
terrific force of momentum to break loose from
the earths gravitational force when i go
to cross the street do i give up in dismay be-
cause i cant cross the street with the speed
of light of course not i take my time and
cross it at a fair rate of speed well why
cant a rocket ship or any other kind of a
ship take its time for a little while until the
gravitational force has been sufficiently outdis-
tanced to allow a speed great enough to carry
the ship to the moon i ask you

  please doctor sloane dont pour any more
cold water down our necks if your opinion
is that interplanetary travel is an impossi-
bility you stick to it but dont discourage us
any more

  i am a lover of bob olsens work please
try and print at least one of his stories every
month

                            berkeley calif

  it is strange that a well meaning indi-
vidual like the editor of as should not be
allowed to make a statement as to his personal
belief in the possibility or impossibility of
going to the moon without exciting what may
almost be called indignation something over
half a dozen adventurers have managed to get
up to a height of a little over ten miles
with ensiling death of three of them and if
stunt flights to one-twenty thousandth the dis-
tance of the moon have produced such meager
results it does not look well for future travel
to the probably almost airless satellite with its
extremes of temperatures-editor
