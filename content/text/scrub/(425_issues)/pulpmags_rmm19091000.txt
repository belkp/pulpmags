  our third mile-post

reminiscenccs of an exciting run during which wc have nego-
      tiated all grades curves and rough track and on which we
      are still breaking all previous records the green light
      shows the signal has been given the right of track is
      ours and we are off again on schedule time all aboard 

byt he editor

hree years is not- a long time in the life of a magazine usually it
is only long enough to discover the difficulties in the way and 
suggest some of the methods by which they can perhaps be over-
come-in time to start a magazine and see it come to full stature
of popularity and influence before it has reached the end of its third
year is something of an achievement if we were not naturally modest we would
say that it is unexampled in the history of magazine-making but that would be
conceited and the egotistical tempt fate so we shall say only that it is some-
thing quite worth doing

getting the right of way and opening the line for traffic

     in the first number which appeared three years ago this month mr munsey
announced the raiiroad mans magazine as a new creation saying fur-
ther there is nothing else in america or in any other country just like it
we have had no examples to follow consequently we may have fallen short
of the mark at which we have aimed but perfection is usually a thing of
growth the important thing is to begin-to make a start

    we have made the start now we take the opportunity to pause a moment
and look back at the way we have come-not long perhaps but starred with
places where decisions have been made and problems solved dotted with reminders
of good friends we have made-and kept and after all that is the great
achievement-to have made friends and kept them if we have any pride in the
work of our hands it is chiefly in that this magazine has become a great room


the railroad mans magazine

in which editors and contributors and readers may meet on common footing and
discuss their differences and discover their common likings tell the old stories
and sing the almost forgotten songs listen to accounts of great deeds and laugh
over the recital of comical experiences-perhaps grow a little sad over the trage-
dies that must creep into such a gathering

a glance at the service and the operating force

    we cannot hope to call you all by name - you are too numerous and too
widely scattered all that we can do here is to reintroduce those who have been
among us most frequently-to whose work no small part of the success of the
magazine is due nto magazine ever had a more loyal and intelligent corps of
contributors and never was a magazine more appreciative of their work it is
impossible to name all to do so would be to call the roll of the men in the
united states who are writing about the railroad from almost every conceivable
angle the fiction the drama the poetry the humor the tragedy of the railroad
-all have had a place m this magazine and will continue to have so long as rail-
roads exist we can call up only a few which you know best arid recall to mind
some of the work which they have done for us who edit and for you who read

    the first purpose of this magazine-and one which it will never relinquish-
has been to cover the railroad field of the united states to the remotest nook and
corner for this reason plans were at once made to place a special traveling
correspondent in the field gilson willets was the man selected in the last
three years he has traveled nearly twenty thousand miles in your behalf visiting
every important railroad center in the districts which he reached talking with
railroad men of every grade and experience gathering stories old and new soak-
ing up the essence of railroad work and life

     his first venture was over the union pacific and part of the southern pacific
as far as sacramento california we started him out in october  and tht
first result of his work appeared in january  under the title  fighting
fire in the sierra snowsheds this was the first authentic account that has
ever appeared in any magazine of the precautions taken by the southern pacific
to protect the great line of snowsheds on the western slope of the sierra nevada
mountains its stories of close calls and thrilling experiences was an earnest of
that which was to come in later instalments from mr willets

    in february of that year we printed the first number of the real thing
 campaigning with a railroad army the title describes the articles better
than any amplification could possibly do it i a fight every day and every night
that the railroaders of the mountains and plains are carrying on with water and
wind and snow with fire and with animals and with animal-like men who crave
the treasure carried in the roaring expresses

with willets on everybodys main line

    eight numbers there were in all and when mr willets finished that first
series he was in chicago hobnobbing with the men of the union station there
perhaps you remember the story of the fight of big jim ashley to put the
new toledo and ann arbor tracks across the line of the michigan central at
howell michigan that was the one with which the series ended it was
picked up by mr willets in chicago and was typical of the forgotten yarns
which he raked out of the memories of the many men with whom he talked

    so much for the first trip no sooner was he home than we started him
our third mile-post



ff again after the fashion of strickland gillilans old railroad rime  off- agin on
agin -you know the rest of it it was in january  that we gave you the
 first number of his new series around the i liion by rail and for fourteen
months he poured out the contents of his note-books filled during his ten-thou-
sand-mile trip from chicago to the coast over the great northern down the
coast to los angeles thence back to st iouis on the rails of the santa fe down
to new orleans by the illinois central across to jacksonville following the gulf
coast and so up to washington and home it was the first time any correspond-
ent for a magazine had  bounded the united states by rail and the length of
the series is proof of the richness of the material he gathered for every article
was pruned down to the very heart of its best anecdotes

     in february of the present year that series ended and prompt on the follow-
ing month mr willets was ready to pick up the thread with  riding the rail
from coast to coast which is still running for this series mr willets made
his way to boston collecting the cream of the stories that have risen to the sur-
face of the new england district thence he swung westward to chicago gath-
ering a bundle of anecdotes told him by the railroaders of the great lakes on the
way in chicago he paused again and then he was off to st paul to set foot
on a train of the northern pacific which carried him still westward to describe
in detail the points which he touched would be to anticipate butte gave up her
best the new line of the st paul was represented in the august fntniber in
september you had the romantic story of salt lake

     in later numbers you will follow mr willets over the oregon short line
thence to los angeles over the line of the newest desert railroad to linger a
while among the railroaders of the golden state then you will make your way
eastward again over the southern pacific through the last of the territories to
el paso the next step will take you into a new series in which you will tour
texas and oklahoma a veritable  railroad empire that must suffice for the
twenty-thousand-mile wanderings of the special traveling correspondent of the
railroad mans magazine

     small wonder that watch for willets the slogan of the men along the
routes he travels has become also a foreword of good things to come to the readers
of the magazine

gripping stories of the men who held up trains

     the first number of the magazine contained the first instalment of a series that
ran for a year  the great american train robberies over forty years ago
the first train robbery occurred near the little town of marshfield indiana since
then the record has been a long and sometimes a gory one  the marsh-
field affair the younger gang rise and fall of jesse james and  ihe
mysterious thirteen  were the subtitles in the first volume hedgepeth oliver
perry evans and sontag morgan and searcey-these were some of the names
that have been made famous for their infamy and have found a place in these
chronicles	f

    it is pleasant to turn from train robberies to more peaceful matters such
for example as the  observations of a country station-agent thought you
would remember that yes the author is a real station-agent-a plain ordinary
railroad man-and his name is smith the anecdotes he tells are of things that
really happened for years he has been working daily in a small station of a great
railroad observing the foibles and weaknesses of the people who patronize railroads
and now and then of those who run them and theseobservations are the result

the interesting observations of one smith

    do you remember what he said in his first number way back in july 
 long since without analysis or philosophy the great public has fixed the status
of the average agent as a grouch the timid approach him tentatively and apolo-
getically and are unduly thankful for intelligence handed out in homeopathic
doses the bold and brave demand in strong and insistent voice information
that often comes with the joyousness of a boy parting with a tooth

    pretty nearly true isnt it and that is a sample of the homely wit and
philosophy that our station-agent has been handing out for the last two years-
and the end is not yet his fund of well-timed illustration and apt moralizing
is apparently inexhaustible to the great joy of those of you who have had ex-
perience with the practical side of railroading

    speaking of practical things there are the articles on help for men
who help themselves we aim not only to amuse and interest but
also to instruct as the circus posters say early in our career we came to the
conclusion that a magazine which did only the first two would have difficulty in
finding an abiding-place in the hearts of railroaders therefore we determined
to do what we could to add to the knowledge of those who are anxious to be better
railroaders and to climb higher on the ladder

    to that end we have given practical expert instruction in subjects that bear
directly on the daily work of those of you who are running trains or selling tickets
or checking freight or walking track or doing any one of the multitudinous duties
that make up the sum total of railroad work we have described in detail the
process of building a railroad from the preliminary survey to the laying of the
last rail

training young men for future railroad presidents

    we have told how the track is kept in order how the trains are run what
are the duties of the motive-power department where the trainmaster and his
minions come into the game how a man may become an engineer and what he
does after lie reaches that proud eminence  we have pointed the way step by step
to the chair of the division superintendent we have described in detail the work-
ing of foreign railroads as compared with the methods in use on our own lines
and last month we illustrated the working of the air-brake probably the most
important in the long list of railroad inventions
our third mile-post



    the complete list of this important series is as follows

the making of an engineer	railroads- race with time

             robert h rogers	robert h rogers

how a locomotive boiler works	making a division superintendent

            robert h rogers	one of them

j h gingrich	charlton c andrews

railroads for to-morrow	in the train service

              john elfreth watkins	wyatt ellerton

how the air-brake works	c f carter

    then there were those articles on  electricity for telegraphers which
we are assured were the best and most useful of their kind that had ever been
published we could go on citing examples of what has been done in this direc-
tion for a full page and each sentence would only confirm our hopes that we
could bring together in readable form a vast amount of valuable information for
the young and the ambitious among our readers the popularity of this depart-
ment as evinced in the letters from our readers is the best proof of its success

trials and triumphs of the pioneer railroad builders

    among the numerous untouched fields of railroad literature that we entered
early in our career was the historical-not only biographical but what we may
call institutional many of the great systems of the country had their birth in
circumstances both unexpected and romantic the erie for example sprang
from a honeymoon trip over the newly established south carolina railroad
when this fact came to our attention it set us to wondering if similar origins
could not be found for other roads and we set c f carter to work collecting
the material in due course you read the early story of the baltimore and ohio
the erie the pennsylvania the new york central the santa fe the union
pacific the canadian pacific and other systems whose destiny is now closely in-
terwoven with the industrial and social fabric of the country later this series
became a book when railroads were new and was welcomed as a great
addition to the railroad literature of the united states

    mr carter also wrote for us  the inside history of great inventions not
strictly railroad perhaps but bearing so closely on the labor of transportation
and communication that we could not pass it by mr carter was also responsi-
ble for the  men who have made travel safe in which the whole field of


till railroad mans magazine

railroad improvement was traversed-from ross winans builder of the baltimore
and ohio and first of the long list of railroad inventors to plimmon h dudley
inventor of the modern steel rail who is still laboring to perfect the pathway of
flying limiteds and the pounding freights in between these two names we re-
counted the achievements of baldwin first of the great locomotive builders
westinghouse the wizard of the air-brake pullman who added ease as well as
safety to railroad travel and lorenzo coffin who brought to pass the safety ap-
pliance law which has saved thousands of lives and millions of money and this
too was a new thing parts of the story had been told here and there but never
before as a related whole

    biography the man behind the machine the personality that makes the thing
a possibility has always been a strong point with us not only the men
at the top s-ir william van horne who began as a telegraph operator and
is now head of the great canadian pacific w h newman who was once a
station-agent and retired lately from the chair of president of the new york
central gould harriman the czar of the greatest transportation system in the
world moffat who is amusing himself in his old age by putting a railroad over
the rocky mountains yoakum of the rock island james j hill almost the
last of the old school of railroad builders c s mellen one of the greatest of
the new-not only these men have been pictured in our pages but also the lesser-
known men the privates in the ranks and the non-commissioned officers of the
railroad army

what electricity has done to revolutionize all things

    our first number had a story of a ride with  big arthur  allen of the
empire state last month we told you some stories of charles w douglas only
a few months dead the first train-despatcher in the united states and also the
first man to take a message by sound before that we gave you lawrence the
oldest conductor in the pullman service then there was conductor jennings
who saw the first railroad run in the state of ohio franklin now assistant man-
ager of the terminal properties of the grand central station in new york who
knew the first vanderbilt and ran a train between new york and new haven
in the stormy days of the civil war and a host of others who have helped to
make railroad history without striving to add luster to their names meanwhile
it is an illustrious list that roll of obscure heroes and only lack of space prevents
our adding more names to it here

    every great event has its story and every great movement however imper-
sonal to outside appearance has its personal and romantic aspect even the
story of electricity by earl mayo dry and scientific in appearance
as the name is has its human face as our readers can testify it took us seven
numbers to tell that story and it is only just lately completed but the narrative
probably commemorates the high-water mark of human invention thus far what-
ever is done in the future in the mechanical field will relate back in some wav to
the work of the men who have tamed the mysterious fluid and set it to work fetch-
ing and carrying for the sons of men it runs at our behest and awaits our com-
mands as an obedient servant should it does our menial tasks and serves our
slightest whims it also bears our greatest burdens and solves our most perplex-
ing problems in the overcoming of time and space all this and more we told in
the series on the stor of electricity if any one doubts the im-
portance of the subject he has only to watch the course of railroad development
for the next decade we are not prophesying-only telling you

    our fiction is very far from being the least object of our pride the moun-
our third mile-post



tain railroaders of robert fulkerson hoffman with tliefr cool daring and their
warm hearts die human care-free tramps of mr emmet f harte to whose
credit lie also the exploits of the inimitable honk and horace the beautifiers of
the  and p the wheedling fiery irishmen that mr e w cooley has given
us the quaintly humorous characters of frank condon-all these and more have
found a place in these columns to make us laugh and cry

life-throbbing fiction full of smiles and tears

    the serials have been the best that we could get from the very start in
our first issue we gave you the opening instalment of  dan quixote which later
appeared in book form as  the brass bowl and speedily took its place among
the n six best sellers of the year then there was the projectile that un-
believable but yet enthralling tale of speed which found longer life between book-
covers as the sixth speed last year we had the girl and the bill also
destined for the more permanent form of a book others there have been which
were confined to the pages of this magazine but yet have made friends by the
thousand do you remember the onyx ear that captivated by its unlikeli-
hood  running the signal and the paymasters special tales of real rail-
roaders that real railroaders read and approved at bay on the limited whose
breathless speed partook of the rush of the transcontinental train on which the
entire action took place these stories alone would have justified the existence of
experts has confirmed his accuracy and judgment

    but it has done more-much more for example for the last two years our
railroad expert has answered literally thousands of questions that have reached
him through his department  by the light of the lantern they have been
sticklers some of those questions but our expert has always found the answer
though the ground covered has ranged from the operation of block signals to the
chances for an american railroader in far-away brazil and the opinions of other
experts has confirmed his accuracy and judgment

    our  recent railroad patents  is another department that has ministered
to the wants of those who wish to know not only the romance of railroading but
also the sober fact in the three years of the magazines existence there has not
been a patent granted at washington bearing on railroad operation t any impor-
tant degree that has not been described in that department it has reflected step
by step the forward movement in the mechanical side of the work of transporta-
tion and its pages furnish forth an accurate history of three years progress

    we must not forget our artists side by side with ourselves and our con-
tributors they have labored to make this magazine the highest expression of
railroad life and thought it has been our ambition from the first to make this
magazine not only interesting but  right

the past prophesies the future

    we have come to the end of our retrospect but the work has only begun
we have paused for this backward look not in any spirit of brooding over a fin-
ished task but only to run over with you the steps that we have taken as proof
that we are now ready to go forward to broader results and higher aims if the
magazine has been good in the past it will be better in the future all that time
money thought patience and persistence will accomplish we shall spread before
you monthly to the end that line railroad mans magazine may fitly express
the lives and thoughts and deeds of the  men who spend their days and
nights along the  miles of railroad track in the united states
 most unique railway station

the pennsylvanias new york structure is really a monumental

                    bridge over the tracks

the pennsylvania railroad has placed in
position the last piece of stone in the
exterior of its new station in new york
city this involved the completion of stone-
work enclosing some eight acres of ground
to enclose this vast area has necessitated
the building of exterior walls aggregating
 feet nearly half a mile in length and
has required  cubic feet of pink
granite

  in addition there have been utilized inside
the concourse  cubic feet of stone a
total of  cubic feet of granite have
thus been utilized in the construction and
ornamentation of this building it took -
 freight-cars to transport these 
tons of stone from milford massachusetts

  in addition to the granite the construc-
tion of this building has called for the use
of  tons of steel there have also
been set in place some  bricks
weighing a total of  tons the lirst
stone of the masonry work  the building
was laid june   the entire masonry
was thus completed in approximately thir-
teen months after the work was begun

  built after the roman doric style of

architecture the building covers the entire
area bounded by seventh and eighth ave-
nues and thirty-first and thirty-third
streets the depth of the property on both
streets is  feet j inches and the length
of the building is  feet  inches thus al-
lowing for extra wide sidewalks on both
avenues the walls extend for  feet 
inches from thirty-first to thirty-third
streets the seventh avenue facade signal-
izing the main entrance

  in designing the exterior of the building
messrs mckim mead  white the archi-
tects were at pains to embody two ideas
to express with the unusual condition of
tracks far below the street surface and in
spite of the absence of the conventional
train-shed the exterior design of a great
railway station in a generally accepted form
and also to give to the building the character
of a monumental gateway and entrance to a
great metropolis

  the structure is really a monumental
bridge over the tracks with entrances to
the streets on its main axes and  all four
sides in this respect this building is unique
among the railway stations of the world

value of scrap

re-creating from things thrown away and saving money by the
enforcement of sale guarantees

ax item of considerable importance on a

-	railroad is scrap-iron and while this
can lie easily understood by the general pub-
lic the outsider can scarcely have an idea
of the care and skill exercised in the hand-
ling of this commodity

  in the simla fc employees magazine
mr c h itoiijville of the santa les pur-
chasing department gives an outline of the
procedure followed on that road

  during  he says on the santa
fe railroad there was sold  tons of
scrap-iron for  or an average
of  tons monthly at  per ton and
during  there was sold s tons for
 or an average of  tons
monthly at  per ton

   the above is sufficient to show the im-
portance of the scrap department of a rail-
road and when attention is called to the
new yorks millions



fact that much more money is saved by
reason of the rigid inspection at the scrap-
pile than that represented by the above
figures the position lately assumed by the
various lines with regard to this department
is shown to be of great importance

   larry of the track gang does not mean
to be careless when he throws a bent track
wrench lining bar or failed shovel onto the
pile beside the section-house but he has not
the time nor tools to straighten them and
he knows nothing of the terms of the con-
tract under which the shovel is supplied

   a broken coupler means just so much
delay to a freight-train already behind
time so the examination for blow-holes is
not made until it reaches a scrap-yard at
the store-house failed wheels defective
tires cracked bolsters and truck frames are
only a small portion of the many items that
the store and mechanical departments jointly
inspect

  the number of tons of bar-iron taken
from old truss rods etc and worked over
into bolts and other merchantable iron is
startlingly large when we consider that
what would be sold as scrap without in-
spection at less than one cent per pound
must be purchased at more than that amount

  the common procedure is for the track-
men to pile all scrap material onto a work-
traiu carry it to the nearest section-hoitse
and hold it until the scrap-train goes through
inspection may and should be made at these
points by the section foreman or roadmas-
ter to select all usable material for the tool-
liotise

  the balance is then loaded onto the scrap-
train sent over the division and tinds its
way to a storehouse with a scrap-sorting
yard the santa fe has one at each of the
following points corwith albuquerque
san bernardino richmond and cleburne

   the car loads are then gone over
thoroughly by experienced sorters under a
competent foreman and the material is un-
loaded into the various piles or bins as
there are ninety-six different items in the
classification of scrap the good material
is returned to  stock c material that can
be so bandied is reworked

   that which has failed in service through
defect or which has not outlived its guaran-
tee is either returned to the shipper for re-
placement or a credit equivalent to its scrap
value is allowed by the railroad while re-
placement is made by the shipper or a credit
given for its value as new material

new yorks millions

all metropolitan figures are huge but the transportation statis-
tics put all others in the shade

gigantic things which the mind can-
not grasp either appal one or cease to
have any meaning if repeated year after
year with slight variation that is why the
wonderful statistics of metropolitan traction
are so little appreciated and so little known
by the general public

  the new yorker is used to reading about
millions and billions in his local news the
addition of a few odd millions passes un-
noticed when he is informed that the
capitalization of the transportation com-
panies of his city is over oooooo be
looks at you in a matter of fact way and

  if you tell him that matthcwson was batted
out of the box that is real news though
hard to believe but if you tell him that
 people were carried on the
subway elevated and surface lines of the
city during  a miracle of civilization un-
equalled in the history of the world he may

possibly say  gee  but that is the highest
tribute he will pay for the information

  it is not lack of civic pride but a real
tribute to the seeming incomprehensibility
of the ever changing ever increasing figures
which represent the passenger traffic of the
metropolis

  up to the close of   were

between three and four times that amount

the immediate future even the number of
accidents bears its grim tribute to the in-
credible congestion there being about fifty-
thousand during the year and about six
hundred lives being lost

campbells wedding

race

by harry bedwell

extra  does some stunts trying to reach
junction city in time to hear the joy bells ring

ampbell who had for
some time been standing by
the window knocking holes
in the cupboard with short
vicious kicks turned from
his scrutiny of the unpaint-
ed roofs of the little town that nestled
under the sage-brush hill and addressed
himself to the first trick despatcher who
sat at a table near the other window

   id like to know what a fellow in
my fix can do he complained  what
would you do   lie asked hopelessly

  racey the first trick man completed
an order before answering

   how do  know what  should do 
he said languidly  ive never been in
such a fix you know and  couldnt ad-
vise you anyhow you wouldnt take
advice if id give it

  campbell turned back to the window
and began kicking holes in- the cup-
board again his rough heavy shoes ma-
king the wood and paper yield easily to
the blows

   better cut it out advised racey
dispassionately the chief will come
in here and fall all over you if you
dont

  campbell gave another kick   wish
some one would try it he said

  racey glanced at the big broad shoul-
ders and shook his head  i dont
he remarked- not in here

  as could easily be seen from his ex-
pression and tone of voice campbell was
mad-not angry

  for this was his wedding-day his
bride-elect was one hundred miles away
and he had no way of reaching her all
arrangements had long ago been made
for him to wed nellie mcdonald that
evening at eight oclock but it was now

 pm and he was far from his
hearts desire

  mechanically he took out his watch
and ran his thumb over its face as he
counted the exact time there was left

    could make it by a scratch if theyd
only give me a chance lie muttered to
himself

  campbell was an extra passenger en-
gineer the day before in junction
city he had asked for a two weeks lay-
off that he might marry and take a trip
to the city but they were short of pas-
senger engineers at the time and the
trainmaster had all but gone on his knees
to campbell begging him to take a train
to farnliam promising him that he would
get him back to junction city in time
to marry that night

  but this trainmaster had not counted
on no  trying to knock little squaw
mountain off the map no s sharp
nose went about tvyo feet into the side of
little squaw and then stopped when
the smoke cleared away it was found that
the engine aud three cars were off the
track and about one hundred yards of
track torn up this of course blocked
traffic for some time

  that morning campbell came down to
the despatchers office and demanded
in no gentle tone why he had not been
called to go out on learning of the
antics of no  and the verdict of the
despatcher that the track could not be
repaired and the wreck cleared away
until some time in the afterrtoon camp-
bell came very near choking the des-
patcher

  then he deluged the junction city
telegraph-office with messages to nellie
until that young lady knew not whether
campbell was killed in the wreck or
campbells wedding race



merely behind it and unable to get by
her father who was master mechanic at
junction city had pointed out the fact
that campbell could not be dead and
send so many messages which seemed
logical enough to the girl and relieved
her greatly

  campbell paced the despatchers office
all morning in a rage for there had
been no trains out going t junction city
anti he watched from a distance the hour
set for his wedding

  the chief now came out of his office
and leaned over the train-sheet

   how are they getting along out at
the wreck he inquired of racey

   theyve got a track built almost
around it answered the trick man
 and trains will begin to move some time
this afternoon

   suppose we had better call a crew
for that extra east mused the chief
with his eyes still on the train - sheet
 they ought to be ready for her by the
time she gets there whos next up 
campbell swung round suddenly

   i am he cried joy and relief show-

ing in his voice  call me for that ex-
tra east

    wish you would quit bothering me
campbell he complained  that wed-
ding of yours can wait youre a pas-
senger engineer and not running
freights you make me-

  in two strides campbell crossed the
room gripped the chief by the collar of
his shirt swung him clear of the floor
and spun him around like a top

   you call me to take that freight-
train out  campbells voice was about
as gentle as his grip  im an extra
passenger engineer and youve got to
call me for that train if i say so

  the chief gave a grunt as his feet
touched the floor and he glared up at
campbell for a few moments ehoking
with wrath

  take the freight-train out and see
if i care he spluttered and stalked from
the room

  campbell turned and leaned over ra-
cey threateningly

    im going to take that freight-train
to junction city quicker than any

campbell cleared the counter that separated him from the office


ti-ie railroad mans magazine

frcight-train has ever gone there since
this plug of a road was built he
growled  and if you lay me out any
therell he a man short and a job over
in this office when i get back

  me turned stamped to the door and
down the stairs

   campbell cornered the call-boy in the
baggage-room

   they want you to call a crew
quick he said im going to take
the train out and if you get the rest of
em around here within half an hour
ill buy you enough cigarettes to kill you
in a month

  campbell strode down into the yard
where the switch-crew was slowly making
up the train he knew better than to try
to order these men about so he swal-
lowed his impatience and called to them
cheerily

   get a move on you fellows and
therell be a keg of something cold in
mother monohans wood-shed some of
these nights with my card over the stop-
per

  the switchmen winked at the engineer
and grinned but the engine suddenly
took on- new life

  campbell disappeared inside the
roundhouse where lie found some lazy
hostlers trying languidly to make steam
in one of the big freight-engines

   oh the dickens  he groaned as
he viewed the big boiler set on little
wheels looking so top-heavy that it might
fall over at any moment   forgot id
have to take a leven-hundred engine on
a freight-train he muttered

   he climbed into the cab and snatch-
ing the shovel from the perspiring hostler
pushed him to one side and cried

    get out of here you farmer  

   the hostler slid from the cab and col-
lapsed in a surprised heap on a pile of
hot ashes only to spring to his feet again
with a muttered curse as he sat down in a
tub of water to put out the fire that was
eating holes in his overalls

   the conductor came out of the freight
office with a handful of bills and began
checking off the car numbers on his train-
book as he walked slowly down the long
train

  campbell backed the big engine down
onto the string of cars and a brakeman
made the coupling and connected the air

campbell slid from the cab and looked
over his engine in feverijsb haste then
seeing the conductor sauntering lazily
down the length of the train he rushed
ai him with an angry roar

   do you think youve got a week to
make this trip  he cried  didnt you
know  was in a hurry  

  the conductor looked up into the ex-
cited face of the big engineer with lan-
guid eyes and then continued checking
off the car numbers without saying a
word but he increased his speed per-
ceptibly for he knew that to anger
campbell further would mean almost
certain destruction

  when they had reached the end of the
train the conductor closed his book with
the way-bills folded carefully inside and
remarked carelessly

   better get the orders hadnt we
they crossed the yards and climbed
the stairs to the despatchers office ra-
cey tore off the tissue orders and handed
a copy to each the two took the or-
ders with all due reverence and the con-
ductor read them over aloud

   now campbell said racey coolly
 i dont want you tearing up the track
with any of your phenomenal runs
weve got one eleven-hundred engine in
the ditch now and it will take two der-
ricks to get her out

   who are you  snapped campbell
 i dont see your name on the time-card
anyway how do you expect me to get to
junction city with that drag youve
put three hundred tons more on that train
than the rating calls for

   h jeered racey  did you think
this was a pleasure trip well its not
so you run along like a good fellow 

  it looked for a few moments as though
campbell was going to do personal harm
to the despatc-her but at last he turned
and muttering something under his
breath stamped heavily from the room
across the yards and into the cab

  he tested the air whistled  out-of-
towu and as the conductoy gave a lan-
guid signal he started the train with a
vicious jerk that made the little caboose
at the rear end bounce and bob like a
rubber ball

  campbell glanced back over the long
train with a feeling of exaltation then
suddenly shut off the steam with a curse
campbells wedding race	i

and a yell as the air-brakes clamped the
wheels in starting he had pulled out a
coupling and the train had parted

  lie jumped to the ground and rushed
back to see what had happened there
on the ground lay the draw-bar and a
big hole in the car showed that the car
could not be taken along

fireman one withering look choked a
little with anger and then thrust his
head out of the window without saying a
word

  the fireman still muttering to him-
self slid down into the gangway
bracing himself he took up a shovelful
of coal swung open the fire-box door

m the conductor came forward
and glared malevolently at
campbell

   now you see what youve
done you boghead he cried
angrily

   well have to kick her in
the bad-order spur and leave
her said campbell as he
turned on his heel and strode
toward his engine

   quickly the disabled car was
switched out the train coupled
up and this time the start was
made with more caution as now
they rattled over the last switch
and swung out into the open country
campbell glanced at his watch

    accident number one he muttered 
 and its one-forty-five well have to
ramble some if we get there in time any-
how that car makes us lighter budd
he called to the fireman  this is my wed-
ding march and im going to make it a
record-breakcr 

  the engine rocked and reeled as the
train gathered speed the firemans
eyes opened wider and wider as the speed
increased at the end of the first few
miles they were sticking far out of his
head when lie could stand it no longer
he slid carefully from his seat and made
his way over to the engineers side he
clutched campbell by the sleeve and
shouted hoarsely in bis ear

   for heavens sake man dont you
know this is a leven - hundred engine
and that it will fall over on you if you
dont slow down  

  campbell drew in his head gave the

you see what youve done you boghead  

and threw the coal at the blazing furnace
with all his might but just as he threw
it the door seemed to dodge to one side
and the coal went high over the boiler-
head deluging the engineer

  campbell took his eyes off of the track
long enough to give the astonished fire-
man another withering look then thrust
his head out of the window again

  overcome with surprise the fireman
sank down upon the coal and gaped at
the open furnace door at last he arose
took up another shovelful of coal and
braced himself for another try he was
not to be fooled again so he waited un-
til he was sure of his mark then heaved
the coal at the fire-box with all his
might

  but this time he more than half ex-
pected to see the door dodge him again
when it did not he was taken by sur-
prise and let the shovel go in the fur-
nace with the coal

  not sure just what had happened he


the railroad mans magazine

stood for some time gazing at his empty
hands vacantly then at the roaring fire
when he did comprehend the dread truth
most of liis shovel had by that time gone
curling out of the smoke-stack

  again he clutched at the engineers
sleeve and this time his face was white
with horror

   ive thrown the shovel into the fire-
box   he shouted in campbells ear

  campbell turned and this time there
was the ghost of a grim smile curling
his lips as mechanically he reached for
his watch

   accident number two he said and
his eyes focused on the track ahead
 and the wedding march lias just start-
ed let the band play on 

  the fireman stumbled back into the
gangway with white scared face there
was but one thing to do now and he set
to work at once throwing coal into the
fire-box with his hands there was not
another shovel on the train that he knew
of and lie had no chance to get one until
they reached the first stop it was a
hard task but there was  help for it

  the train rushed on at maddening
speed taking the hills with a rush and
seeming to fall down on the other side

  a brakeman started forward over the
top of the train he gave up before he
had crossed the first car and crawled
back the little caboose seemed to be
trying to do four or five things at once
but it was a safer place than  top
of the box cars

  every few minutes the white - faced
conductor swore that they were oft the
track but the speed increased rather
than slackened

   ill pay him up for this when we get
to little grade- muttered the conduc-
tor once when the caboose stayed in the
air longer than usual

  the fireman still toiled at throwing
coal into the furnace but lie had to keep
the door open so much of the time that
it was doubly hard to keep up steam

  but the engineer opened the throttle
wider

  the blind sidings and the telegraph-
offices flew by in quick succession and
at all points there was a clear signal

  they were out of the hills now and
the desert was before them where the
track was straight and level there were

no trains to meet as none had cleared
the wreck

  the speed seemed to increase the
miles were reeled off in quick succession

the fireman became almost frantic with
the heat and his cramped position but
campbell sat immovable on his seat his
eyes ever on the track ahead merciless-
ly he kept the throttle open wide

  the afternoon shadows were begin-
ning to lengthen when at length they
pulled into little grade and half of
the journey was behind them here
they would take  coal and water and
get their new orders to proceed

  campbell brought the engine to a
standstill at the coal-chute with a master
hand the fireman climbed wearily to
the top of the tender and let down the
door of one of the chutes there was a
rush of coal but it only half-filled the
tender

    whats the matter with you dagos
up there called the fireman with some
heat  why havent you got this chute
full of coal

    gotta  coal up here came the an-
swer no eng to putta it up

  campbell moved the engine up to the
next chute and this time the coal del-
uged the tender and cab
  the fireman climbed into the chute
picked up a shovel and threw it onto
the tender the italian boss looked
wickedly at him as he climbed back into
the cab but the fireman cared little so
long as he had the prized shovel

   ill go back and get the orders said
campbell as he jumped to the ground

  half-way to the depot he spied the
trainmen entering the lunch-counter of
the company hotel

  hey there you hay-pitchers  he
called after them angrily  where do
you think you are going were only
two hours and a half out of a division-
point why didnt you eat before you
started 

   we didnt have time the conduc-
tor answered  we were called  short
notice you know

  campbell ground his teeth and strode
angrily into the telegrapli-ofiice to meet
with another shock

   you fellows will have to put up
coal the operator said blandly

  in one bound campbell cleared the
counter that separated him from the of-
fice and he gripped the operator by the
shoulder

  who says to put up coal he de-
manded hoarsely

   why-why the clespatcher said the
operator wriggling with pain  yours
is the first engine in here since the coal
ran low and therell be a big delay to the

already delayed trains if they come down
here in a bunch from the wreck and find
theres  coal

   tell him bellowed campbell
 that we have a levcn-hundred engine
and cant go onto the chute

   he says grimaced the operator
 that you can leave enough cars between
the engine and the cars you put up to
keep the engine off of the chute

  campbell hesitated for a moment
then turned  his heel vaulted the
counter and ran down the track to his
engine

  the engine watchman had by this time
cleaned the ash-pan of the engine and
was seated in the cab listening to the
excited firemans account of their record-
breaking run

  campbell choked down his wrath and
when he addressed these two his voice
was as low and as sweet as he could
make it

   boys he began  theres got to be
some cqal put up and the train-crew has
gone to eat his voice faltered a little
here but he went on bravely  we
three can put it up if you fellows will
act as my brakemen  and if you will ill
give you four bits apiece

  the fireman and the engine watchman
gaped in astonishment at the liberal offer
and eagerly accepted they clambered
back over the train cut off six cars back
of the engine and campbell ran down
to the coal-spur where
his acting brakemen
coupled on five cars
of coal

  they backed up to
the chute coupled on
the five empty cars
that were  the in-
cline and shoved them
in  a siding again
they backed up to the
chute this time with
greater speed and the
cars of coal mounted
the incline to the
shed

  campbell was still
hot with anger be-
cause the trainmen
had taken advantage
of him and he did
not observe his usual

-with a muttered curse as he sat down in a tub of water
to put out the fire


the railroad mans magazine

caution while putting up the coal the
cars mounted more swiftly than lie sup-
posed and the last one was just enter-
ing the shed before he slackened speed

  then his two brakemen came racing
out of the shed over the cars waving
frantically for him to stop he applied
the air but his helpers had neglected to
connect it and before he could stop two
cars of coal plunged over the other end
of the chute and flattened out on the
ground thirty feet below

  the italian coal-heavers tumbled out
of the shed and scattered in every direc-
tion

  a grim smile showed plainly on camp-
bells face as lie released the engine and
shot down to the level track

  the fireman opened the switch and
campbell backed down to the train he
plucked out his watch and studied it in-
tently

   four-thirty lie muttered  and de-
lay number three the worst half of the
wedding march is yet to come 

  in motion once more the last half
of the journey this time the fireman
had the shovel tied to his wrist for he
was determined not to be tricked into
losing it again

  there were a few miles of level track
before they came into the mountains and
they took them with a rush by the time
they struck the heavy grades the flues
were leaking badly and the steam-gage
showed a gradual lessening of pressure
at last campbell drew the throttle wide
open and turned to the fireman sav-
agely

   cant you keep her jiot he roared

   youre working her too hard com-
plained the fireman  the flues are
leaking

  campbell slid down from his seat and
peered into the fire-box water was
dripping down onto the fire iu many
places

   great scott  growled the engineer
 i wish i had some bran

    i think said the fireman  that the
car next to the head one is loaded with
bran t saw the advertisement on the
side of the car  but you cant get it go-
ing at this rate

  campbell gripped the fireman by the
arm until he wriggled

   get up there on my seat he or-

dered  and run her till i come back
dont you dare slow down unless its
around a curve 

  he turned and climbed swiftly over
the coal wabbled across the first car
and disappeared between it and the next

  the fireman shuddered then turned his
eyes resolutely to the track ahead

  campbell slid part way down the
brake-rod between the rocking swaying
cars and balanced himself on the only
step within reach the end door of the
car was sealed with a tin seal and elect-
ed at the end

  lie gripped the seal and tore it loose
with one jerk then half braced half
balanced lie kicked straight down at the
cleat with all his might

  he knew that to miss it once would
probably overbalance him and send him
down to certain death  so each kick was
well aimed four times lie struck straight
down with all his might before the cleat
gave way and dropped to the track be-
neath

  he stopped to breathe a moment then
leaning far down holding only by one
hand he seized the catch of the door and
pulled it open

  just as he did so the cars swayed apart
in opposite directions and wrenched loose
his hold he balanced dizzily on the
step a moment then swung downward
a sickening feeling tore at his vitals  but
with a catlike turn he managed to light
feet foremost on the bumpers where he
clung for some time to regain his lost
breath and quiet his nerves

  sacks of bran filled the open car door
and he ripped one open with his knife
a stream of bran followed and taking
off his jacket he made a bag of it hold-
ing it under the stream of bran until it
was full he bound it tightly with the
sleeves

  three feet below death nipped at his
heels-but he was not thinking of that
he was growing a little vague as to why
he was running all these risks to make
time but his determination was still the
same

  closing the car door and taking the
bran in his teeth he swung out to the
side of the car and climbed to the top
he wabbled across the length of it again
over the coal and into the cab

  soon he was pouring bran into the
camlbells wedding race



boiler this stopped the leaking some-
what and the needle on the steam-gage
began to climb round to its accustomed
place

  but now they were nearing the scene
of the wreck and were compelled to take
the siding to wait until the liberated
trains passed

  there was an agonizing delay of twen-
ty minutes before the first train came in
sight and campbell put in the time
p a c i n g up and
down the track
muttering ineffec-
tual curses at the
waste of time

  then there was
another wait of fif-
teen minutes be-
fore all the trains
were clear and by
that time camp-
bell was nearly mad
with impatience

  he rushed out
of the siding at
great speed when
he was liberated
and came very near
leaving behind the
brakeman who
closed the switch

  out in the open
again campbells
loud-mouthed im-
patience gave way
to silent grim de-
termination

  by this time the
train-crew was get-
ting a
to fast

campbells reckless
pace did not
frighten them so
much as lief ore

  he slackened speed not at all now
swinging around curves at a rate that
took away the breath while the down-
grades seemed naught but a straight
dizzy drop

  only when they came to the scene of
the wreck did he slacken speed at all
and even here he exceeded the speed limit
to such an extent that the section men
standing near the track moved away to
a safe distance as the cars swung by

    	r r

  darkness settled down at six oclock
there was no moon the headlight
which the fireman had lighted while they
were at little grade was burning bad-
ly and threatened to go out entirely

   but there was no stopping to repair it

  one of the brakemen who had taken
one drink too many at little grade now
climbed out of the caboose and over the
top of the train to a seat on a brake-wheel
his lantern proclaiming his presence

  campbell did
not see this man
for some time-not
until they had
passed the last
telegraph-office lie-
fore entering
j u  c t i o n city
h a p p e n i n g to
glance back he saw
the lantern sudden-
ly shoot high in the
air drop to one
side of the track
and go out

  at about the
same instant there
was a jar of light-
ening air - brakes
and the engineer
was thro w n
through the
cab - window he
turned over two or
three times in his
flight through the
air and lit on the
loose soil at the
side of the track

  he lay quiet for
a f e w moments
partly stunned
then sat up and
looked about won-
deringly he saw
the engine a few rods ahead of him stand-
ing quite still farther along he could
climly see a break in the train and a
dark mass at the side of the right of way
which he thought must be derailed cars

  painfully he got to his seat and hob-
bled toward the rear of the train he
did not seem badly hurt - merely
scratched and bruised and stunned lie
remembered having such a tight grip on
the throttle that when he went out of the

  little used
  running

not sure ust what had happened he
stood for some time gazing at his
empty hands vacantly then
at the roaring fire
the railroad mans magazine



window it was closed before his hand was
wrenched loose

  lights appeared toward the end of the
train as some of the trainmen came run-
ning forward campbell hobbled to-
ward them but was stopped by the over-
turned box cars there appeared to be
quite a number of them and he sat down
on the trucks of one swearing fluently

  another groan from the darkness an-
swered his question and all started in
the direction of the sound they came
upon the brakeman stretched out on his
back in the sand he sat up and blinked
at the light as the men came up

   give me just one more drink he
begged looking around in a puzzled sort
of way  whats happened he asked

at the darkness and wondering where the
fireman was

  he had forgotten the brakeman whose
lantern he had seen go over with the
wrecked box cars but he remembered
him now as he heard a groan from some-
where out in the darkness to the left

  the conductor and one brakeman came
in sight and flashed their lanterns on the
wreck at sight of campbell both be-
gan to swear softly in awed tones as
though looking on a ghost

  how did you get here-asked the
conductor at length

   i fell out confessed campbell
 how many cars are off the track

   about five or six answered the con-
ductor wheres my head brakeman

after a pause am i drunk or dream-
ing  or am i dead  

   youve just had your toes over the
ragged edge said the conductor  this
rapid-fire-gun of an engineer has put us
in the ditch and near killed us all how
do you feel

  the brakeman felt his left shoulder
tenderly

  my wings broke he declared and
scrambled to his feet

  they walked around the wreck count-
ing the derailed cars

   i count five oil the track said the
conductor as they completed the circle
 three cars more and the caboose would
have gone he added

  on the track they found the fireman
campbells wedding race

white-faced and very nervous looking
over the torn-up track by the light of a
torch

    five rail lengths of track torn up
he announced as the odiers came up
 is that you campbell he asked  i
thought youd quit thejob by the way
you left the cab

   well this means trouble for some
one said the conductor looking hard at
campbell

   the big engineer straightened

    im going to take whats left of this
train to junction city now he declared
 theres no telegraph-office between
here and the junction so ill run along
in and head the wrecker out to you better
put out your lights right away he cau-
tioned as he hobbled toward his engine
followed by the fireman

  if youre not careful this wedding
march will be turned into a funeral pro-
cession warned the fireman as they
climbed into the cab

  but campbell only gritted his teeth
and opened the throttle

  the fireman plucked at his sleeve as
the engine started

   youll have to hurry or we wont
make it he called  the flues are leak-
ing again

  oh well hurry all right

  as the engine forged ahead campbell
glanced at his watch

   seven-twenty he announced  ill
have to hurry this wedding march along
a bit or itll be late this is accident
ntunberjour i wonder will there be any
more  

  slowly the remnant of  extra  
pulled into junction city and came to
a stop before the yard office the en-
gine was leaking badly again making
a puddle of water beneath her as she
came to a standstill the needle of the
steam - gage showed there was but little
steam and this was fast decreasing

  campbell climbed stiffly from the cab
and made his way toward the open door
of the yard office where mcdonald mas-
ter mechanic and father of nellie stood
looking critically at the engine

  campbell was begrimed with coal
dust his face was streaked with blood
and over all there was a liberal coat of
bran

   youve played the dickens with that
engine growled mcdonald as camp-
bell came up  look at her  he cried
 shes leaking so fast shell be dead be-
fore we can gel her into the shops

   shut up  snapped campbell in a
choked voice  call the wrecker he
ordered  and get em out right away i
put five cars of merchandise into the
ditch at mile-post  wheres nel-
lie  he asked

  why-why is that you campbell
gasped mcdonald   thought you
were tied up in farnham

   wheres nellie  repeated campbell
doggedly

  nellie why she-why you wired
that you couldnt get out of farnham
and i think nellie announced to her
friends that the wedding was postponed
for a little time i think she went to the
theater with willis garvin this evening
why didnt you wire us when you start-
ed he asked in great excitement

   i forgot said campbell weakly as
he sank upon the step

  mechanically his hand sought his
watch-pocket

  seven-fifty-seven he murmured
 this is accident number five

  suddenly he got to his feet

   after youve called the wrecker he
said in low decided tones  you just hike
home as quick as those legs of yours will
carry you and get ready for the wed-
ding take the parson with you as you
go by

   fm going down to the theater and
get nellie if  have to storm the place
im also going to marry her to-night or
turn this town upside down now hur-
ry   he added and strode off toward the
lights of main street with a step which
had suddenly lost its limp

  mcdonald gazed after his future son-
in-law for a few moments in silence

   well he muttered at length  lies

-the master mechanic
the pumpkin-vine special

by milbs mckercher

it came around the curve rather unexpectedly just as the  kid
crew  was communing with nature and thanking
the stars for being alive

way engineers take par-
ticular delight in run-
ning over hand-cars and
velocipedes anyway it
has always seemed so to
me perhaps they dont
opinions differ one thing is sure-they
hit them sometimes once they pretty
nearly hit us

  it was when we were repairing bridges
and trestles on the rochester and winona
division of the c  g w better known
as the pumpkin - vine branch of die
gerkwater

  from utica to winona the track is
just the sort you would expect to see in
a nightmare it typifies what you read
about arkansas railways consisting main-
ly of horseshoe curves ss steep grades
and trestles over gullies

  stanley wright was the foreman of
our crew of five we were all young-
in fact wright himself was not old
enough to vote other gangs called us
the  kid crew but i feel safe in saying
that many of the older crews accom-
plished no more than we did

  one morning in the early part of july
 we found it necessary to take a
case of dynamite from rollingsfpne on
our  armstrong private car we were
in the habit of usually stopping just be-
fore rounding very sharp curves to listen
for any possible trains as a rule
 extras  were few and far between on
the pumpkin-vine  specials  always
created surprise and comment among the
natives

  the  regular  east bound had already
gone tlfrough and we were pumping our

car around curves and over liigh bridges
talking merrily we had just arrived at
the conclusion that even if we did spend
a good deal of muscle on the derrick and
crane not to mention the hand-car
perhaps after all our life on the road
free from care and worry toiling lazily
in one of earths pretty garden spots
letting the early morning sunshine trickle
down on us  perhaps we thought
 such a life in spite of some slight dis-
advantages was pretty nearly ideal

  far were our thoughts from danger
guess then our surprise when coming
around the last curve in a deep cut we
were suddenly confronted by a huge lo-
comotive drawing two cars of horses and
coming like a whirlwind

  she looked as big as a barn to us a
sheer wall of rock on each side a ninety-
foot trestle a few yards back of us-ap-
parently no chance of getting out

  and a case of dynamite aboard

  we held our breath as stanley applied
the brake our first thought was to
jump then common sense told us that
to do so would be fatal-not only to our-
selves but to the train and crew as well

  there wasnt near time enough to re-
verse the motion of the car and run back
until the engineer could stop the onrush-
ing train and we did not fancy being
hurled off the high trestle with the proba-
bility of the whole train crashing down
on top of us

  we glanced at each other in dismay
the cold sweat trickled down my back
we heard the locomotive whistle fran-
tically then saw the engineer dodge
down low in his cab
silent heroes of the rail



  my heart beat furiously with one
accord we were about to abandon the
car and run toward the train when
stanley white as a sheet but calm and
with great presence of mind almost
screamed the order  pick up the car-r
boys 

  it seemed useless but we had great
faith in our young boss being in the
habit of obeying orders we did pick up
the car and at a signal from him placed
it on edge against the rock bank stan-
ley meantime grabbing the explosive

  we were just about in time too for as
the locomotive whizzed by something
caught my overalls ripping them from

the waist to the knee it was a very
close call

  stanley gazed after the disappearing
train and watched it out of sight ihen
he fished out his dinky little pipe leaned
up against the rocks and filled and lit it

   guess by jinks said he we
ought to take a run down to st charles
and recuperate our exhausted nerves
stanley was great-on speeches  hang
it you fellows look scared to death be-
sides  want to write a letter to mamie

  so we took a holiday and rambled down
to st charles when our checks came
on pay-day i cant say as i noticed any
 lay-off  recorded either

silent heroes of the rail

by robert h rogers

hero is a much-abused word it means almost anything from a man
who saves a ship-load of people by brave and long-sustained endeavor
to a matinee idol we have made many in this country and forgotten
them within a week meanwhile heroism walks among us daily and we
fail to see it

    our monthly department the industrial roll of honor proves this and
the article that follows adds-further point to our belief that the man who
does his duty simply and unostentatiously as he sees it in spite of dangers
and discomforts or actual suffering is a very real hero in a very real manly
way	

railroad men of all grades who have faced danger and endured
discomfort in the simple performance of
their every-day duties

ste night in the winter of
s  at a few minutes
before twelve oclock en-
gineer champagne of the
new york new haven
and hartford railroad
advised the night-foreman at south bos-
ton that the window glass was missing
from the front door of the cab or his
side of engine - this might appear
a simple matter for the carpenter on
duty to repair before the engine was due

to depart for the south station aud so
it would have been did time permit

  the yard schedule however demand-
ed that this engine must leave the round-
house at  pm sharp to take out the
midnight new york express and the 
was then over half an hour behind con-
sequently engineer champagne backed
off the turntable with the pane knocked
out

 it was seasonable new england
weather a wild blizzard from cape


the railroad mans magazine

fob over four hours this man sat facing the cold and the
howling wind in all its fury

cod way for the past twenty-four hours
had been sweeping relentlessly west from
provincetown and zero temperature
with the usual accompaniment of needle-
like snow conspired to make a wintry
scene extending from boston to the grand
central station the street-car and even
the cab service in the hub was practi-
cally suspended and the few passengers
made their way to the train with diffi-
culty breathing meanwhile bitter invec-
tives against the east wind and all that it
brought then they entered the warm
and comfortable sleepers and promptly
forgot their passing discomforts

  up forward on the big engine it was
different that front window meant a
great deal to the engineer it was his

only protection against
the driving snow and
gale the latter to be
intensified by the giddy
speed at which he must
run and to one fa-
miliar as himself with
the prospect ahead a
heros nerve was re-
quired to pull out
without it

  for over four hours
this man sat facing the
cold and the howling
wind in all its fury
when the train finally
halted in the new
haven depot where
the  was changed
for the new york di-
vision engine he was
in a state of exhaus-
tion and literally en-
cased in ice it is
impossible to conceive
what he must have en-
dured on that long run
of one hundred and six-
ty miles

  this is merely an in-
stance of the silent
every - day heroism of
railroad employees
engineer champagne
would have been en-
tirely within his rights
and would have been
upheld by the com-
pany had he refused
roundhouse in south
boston until the damage had been re-
paired but he knew that this could not
be done in season to start on time so
he accepted the hardship and danger
and started on his run without a murmur
although the outlook might well have
daunted the stoutest heart

turkish bath in the cab

  the story of the iron rail is so bestrewn
with similar examples of devotion to duty
that the record of a single road would
furnish material for a volume unfor-
tunately few if any are heralded in
print because these men are loyally reti-
cent and because they are grounded in

to leave the
silent heroes of the rail



the belief that such inconveniences are
merely incidental to their calling

  about two years ago the body of pat-
rick collins mayor of boston was being
brought to his native city on train 
popularly known as the  federal ex-
press two miles west of providence
the throttle-packing blew out of engine
 which was handling the train

  the immediate result was to fill the
cab with steam followed by a continuous
spray of hot almost boiling water which
as might be expected selected for its
target the fireman shoveling his coal

  common sense in view of the discom-
fort in the cab dictated that another
engine should be put on the train at
providence and the  left there for
a moment engineer connors entertained
this idea because there was a rebef-
engine available at the charles street
roundhouse only a mile up the track but
he as promptly dismissed it

   weve got the mayors body aboard
john he said to fireman sonnnerville
 there is a committee waiting in boston
and everybody on the road and in the
city wants the train in on time

   can you stick it out another forty-
five miles if you cant  will call for
the  here but we will lose fifteen
minutes making the change

shoveled three tons of coal

  while they were taking water john
reflected and then told the engineer that
lie wouldnt mind a little thing like a
wetting the train left providence with
the leaky  and arrived in the big
train-shed of the south station on time
to the minute

  the big locomotive with its tolling
belf attracted little attention as the fu-
neral cortege passed through other than
this mark of respect by her crew but had
the mourners observed closely they would
have seen two men as nearly drowned as
it is possible for men to be who have not
actually been submerged the fireman
was in the-worst plight of the two

  from the time when the throttle-pack-
ing gave out he had shoveled nearly three
tons of coal and in depositing each
shovelful where it belonged he had re-
ceived the full volume of boiling water
escaping from the ruptured joint

  the cab had been filled with steain
to such an extent that even the towermen
along the road observed it and wired
ahead fearing there had been an acci-
dent the men who stood for upward
of an hour like specters in the fog re-
ceived a letter from their master me-
chanic commending them for not giving
up their engine at providence

crippled but on the job

  the case of engineer e t parlett
of the baltimore and ohio railroad
illustrates the extremes to which the dis-
regard of comfort even when it entails
actual suffering may be carried in order
to  make the time a short time ago
while engine  on the  am limited
out of washington for philadelphia was
gaining speed after crossing the susque-
hanna river the reverse lever became
unlatched nd flew back with a bang
into the corner of the quadrant

  sixty miles an hour was the mandate
of the schedule but so great was the
strain thrown upon the lever by the
moving parts when traveling fast it
became necessary to reduce the speed
in order to hook it back where it be-
longed

  as parlett pushed in the throttle and
reached for the brake-valve to pull her
down he felt a sudden sharp pain in
his left hand a glance showed that his
first and second fingers were missing
and that his overalls were spattered with
blood

  with the assistance of his fireman
parlett restored the lever to its proper
position and  picked up speed again
then he bound up the bleeding stumps
with his neckkerchief and threw the am-
putated fingers out of the cab-window

  it was still sixty miles to philadelphia
but he never faltered arriving at the
twenty-fourth and chestnut street sta-
tion on time then he promptly fainted
from pain and loss of blood

  -my hand was resting on the lever
when it unlatched he said afterward
 and it went into the corner so quick
that my fingers were cut off clean as by
a knife against the handle of the sand
lever i suppose why didnt i get off in
wilmington or ask for another engineer
there well i dont know


the railroad mans magazine

   she wasnt steaming very good for
one thing and i knew that if she fell
into strange hands cranky as she was
she wouldnt get the train to the read-
ing on time and thats what we are paid
to do

overtime for a hero

  daniel smith an engineer on one of
the reading flyers between camden and
atlantic city has about as much nerve
as they ordinarily put into a man this
has been shown without the excitement
of a battle-field to urge his decision

  in a similar accident the reverse lever
flew backward while his train was doing
her mile about ten miles east of cam-
den the engineer was found by the
fireman unconscious in the rear of the
cab the latter shut off steam and re-
vived him with cold water

  when smith reached for the refractory
reverse lever he found that his left arm
was broken in spite of the entreaties of
the fireman to stop and have the injury
attended to he ran the engine the re-
maining fifty miles doing the necessary
work with his good hand and making
his time then he was lifted from his
cab and carried to the hospital

  no railroad company requires or ex-
pects such sacrifices from its men but
they seem part of the business and have
become identified with their calling cer-
tainly no official would have instructed
john dejerald a southern railway en-
gineer to pull out on the main track
ahead of a string of runaway freight-
cars with the forlorn hope of stopping
them before they piled into a passenger-
irain a few minutes ahead but this man
took the initiative and did so successfully

  ten of them all heavily loaded had
escaped from the gravity yard at lons-
dale two miles west of knoxville and
were embarking on the down grade lead-
ing to the city when dejerald saw them
coming he had just arrived from ashe-
ville and was waiting to jjut up at the
roundhouse near by

  he motioned to the negro brakeman to
open the switch and let him out and by
the nicest sort of calculation managed to
have his hundred-ton  battle-ship  over-
taken and gently run into by the follow-
ing cars without damage

  then by a vigorous use of the air and
sand he  back-pedaled  the runaway to
a stop and quietly returned it to the
yard where was gathered an excited
group of the yardmaster and his assist-
ants in anxious speculation over the out-
come

   my time was up when i arrived from
asheville was dejeralds only com-
ment to the former  gnd i want an ex-
tra hour for this work charge it to
switching cars in lonsdale yard after
completion of regular trip

  thus was a thrilling incident calrnly
transformed into a matter of routine with
an attendant of forty cents for overtime
had he not stopped the runaways it is
impossible to estimate the damage which
would nave resulted when they met in
the crowded knoxville passenger ter-
minal with the speed of a limited

  there is a peculiar pathos in the story
of fireman marston which is still talked
about by railroad men on the pittsburgh
division of the baltimore and ohio
while he was firing a pushing engine on
whitehall hill just outside of pittsburgh
a few years ago a telegram came to the
glenwood shops in care of the round-
house foreman telling of the death of
marstons mother in a trolley accident

no time for mourning

  the foreman inthe press of other
duties neglected to send the message to
the young man the latter was on the
pusher that day and the next when he
was hurriedly called to fire the west-
bound chicago express to chicago junc-
tion

  it was not until he had reported for
duty that the sad news now two days
old was conveyed to him in the mean-
time only twenty minutes remained for
the engine to reach the pittsburgh depot
if it was to leave on time and there was
no other fireman to take his place

  although dazed with grief over his un-
expected loss marston went with his
train

  if you can wire ahead he said
 and have some one relieve me at new-
castle junction for gods sake do it
every mile is taking me farther away
from my dead mother

  they tried but failed and he was
silent heroes of the rail



  obliged to make the round trip of over
  four hundred miles when he returned
  the next day the funeral was over

    naturally the engineer and -fireman
  from their exposed position at the head
  of the train and their consequently
  greater liability to bear the brunt of
  danger become the
  heroes in the ma-
  jority of these in-
  stances of inborn de-
  votion to duty but
  many similar exam-
  ples can be found
  among the less ex-
  ploited callings of
  the railroad

   there is not a
 roundhouse or shop
 in the country which
 does not number on
 its pay-roll one man
 at least who has per-
 formed some feat out
 of the c o m m o n
 which if properly
 presented w o u  cl
 transcend fiction

  there was a boiler-
  maker employed on
  the baltimore and
  ohio several years
  ago at baltimore

  maryland john rau
   was his name and
  his special job was
  the  hot work  at
  the riverside round-
  house hot work
  means calking boiler-
  flues w hen they
  come in leaking in
  a fire-box temper-
  ature of close to
  two h undr e d de-
  grees

    ordinarily the boiler is well cooled
  before the boiler-maker begins but some-
  times the engine is badly needed and
  time does not permit all of the precau-
  tions which might be observed for his
  comfort

    in this age of organizations and rights
  it becomes only necessary for the man
  to remark to his foreman that  things
  are too hot in there yet and no one has
  authority to order him on the job

   it is said however in the case of rau
that it was only necessary to tell him the
engine was wanted in a hurry and lie
would calk flues under conditions which
would nonplus a salamander

  one day a special was ordered in a
great rush to take the president of the

road to washington as usual as every
engine despatcher can attest the call
found them short of power none of the
few engines available were suitable to
put on the train and it became necessary
to place dependence on the  which
was then in camden station and would
shortly be over to the roundhouse

  preparations were made to clean her
fire and get her around for the special
at the earliest possible moment but on

he had received the full volume ok water escaping from
the ruptured joint


the railroad mans magazine

her arrival her flues were leaking the
master mechanic and every one in au-
thority sought to dissuade rau from en-
tering the fire-box which had been hastily
emptied of fuel until it had cooled a

twenty minutes in the glow-
ing heat under the play
of a hose

little but the boiler-maker
 knew that the engine was
wanted badly and must
 leave for the depot in half
an hour to save the credit of
 the shop

j he went into the fire-box
j and stayed twenty minutes
j in the glowing heat under
the play of a hose stopped
twenty-three squirting flues
and emerged practically par-
boiled but with enough vigor
to demand an extra hour
which needless to add was
thankfully allowed him

so hot was the water in the boiler of
this engine while the work was being
done that after the leaks had been
stopped she was run out of the house
under her own steam

rest-rooms for subway men

all over the country the railroads are

-	realizing that the way lo have an
efficient working force is to encourage
among their men a  club spirit the re-
sult has been the providing of rest-houses

the roads themselves have usually con-
tributed largely often financing the whole
thing

chapter i

the man on the straw

iii	lip sand left the doc-
tors office with an amused
expression playing about his
quietly humorous mouth in
this workaday uneventful
existence there is something
novel- highly interesting and diverting
in the sudden announcement that one is
about to pass away

   i wouldnt care to promise you a
year was dr lauristons way of con-
veying the information  of course i
may be mistaken  but from the appar-
ent progress of the trouble in the last
month or two i feel justified-in fact
it is my duty to warn you

   quite so said philip sand with a
note of sympathy for philip sand

  the announcement was so startling
so all-upheaving so sweeping that it did
not strike philip as being anything
which really concerned him personally
when a man lives for thirty years
hearing of deaths every other day dur-
ing that period he begins to regard
death as something quite abstract -
something which is common to every
other mortal but a thing apart from his
own matters

  that is why it amused philip sand
to be told that he himself was about to
pass away

  of course dr lauriston might be
wrong pie probably was wrong in
fact lauriston was often wrong in his
raven-like predictions it was old phi-

lander sand philips father who once
said 

   so long as lauriston says im going
to die its all right

  old philander did die eventually
perhaps in the spirit world he had time
to reflect on the matter if so lie
probably attributed his mortality to the
fact that for once lie had called in an-
other doctor who had distinctly agreed
with lauriston

  all of which is aside from the gravity
of philip sands condition  but philips
own thoughts were running in the pecul-
iar strain of levity which flows through
a mans brain when he is confronted by
that fact which destroys the sense of
fitness philip sand felt that everything
was a misfit that morning-everything
was ridiculously out of joint

  tie feeling in the prime of health-
except for a little cough which left him
damp and flushy-had been told that he
had not a year to live philip chuckled
as he turned up fifth avenue toward
the park somehow the park called
him just then he wanted to get to the
green trees and the cool water quickly-
just to sit and look at them as if they
would give the lie to the prophecy

  his thoughts wandered as lie strolled
up the gay thoroughfare but all the
time the undertone was lauriston and
what he had said and what he philip
sand thought of lauriston and what he
had said among medical men lauris-
ton was playfully referred to as  lugu-
brious larry yet he was the first spe-
cialist in the diagnosis of pulmonary
troubles


the railroad mans magazine

  philips mother had been deadly
afraid of him philips father had
loved the gloomy physician his gloom
had amused philander old philander
used to say 

   the number of departed that lauris-
ton meets when he walks down the ave-
nue would scare any ordinary man
but maybe he thinks they are ghosts

  and there was another story that used
to amuse old philander sand and the
son chuckled as he remembered his
fathers way of telling it one of dr
lauristons patients lived in a boarding-
house the nurse slept in the next
room she needed sleep but the patient
couldnt afford a relief nurse lauriston
solved the difficulty by getting a tin
horn - the kind you blow on election
night-and placing it by the bedside

  if you feel yourself sinking in the
night said he to the patient  just
blow the horn and the nurse will wake
up

  the scheme worked excellently the
patient had a sinking spell in the night
he blew the horn with his last breath-
and the nurse woke up

   every man his own gabriel  old
philander used to add with a chuckle

  but - supposing dr lauriston was
right and philip sand was in danger
of losing his life he was well aware
that the cure for his trouble had not
yet been discovered and that once the
disease had taken a firm hold it was
oidy a matter of time

  it might be as lauriston had said a
year or it might be five years  but the
fact remained that he had the trouble
in his lungs and that was enough to
cause sober reflection

  it came to philip all at once jnst as
the park arose before him the green
trees and the babies in their perambu-
lators suddenly reminded him that the
sap of life was beginning its annual re-
juvenation everything seemed green
and young and fresh the very air
breathed of life-new life even in his
own veins he could feel it yet the fiat
had been issued the blight also was at
work

  but philip was not of the brooding
temperament when he was confronted
by any fact he adapted himself to it if
it were pleasant he accepted it with the

quiet gratitude of one who docs not
spend what he has recklessly if it were
unpleasant his philosophy covered it or
he trusted to the alleviating circum-
stance that would balance the misfor-
tune

  but this was something new - the
something which the human mind con-
siders with surprise and non-comp r eh en-
sion he had about one year to live
all at once he could hear all the clocks
in the universe ticking in riotous unison
and his faculties became strangely alert
to the little things of the business of
living

  he was filled with the idea that he
must at once balance his books and
realizing the liabilities without much
figuring glean every possible asset to
cover the bankruptcy he settled him-
self to the task

  he philip sand came of a very old
family its history dated back to an-
other land and could be traced through
its history to a dim time when sentences
covered eras his grandfather septi-
mus sand had come from that other
land wiping out his connection with it
by his own personality for septimus
was a dreamer

  septimus loved old books old jugs
old documents he was a neer-do-well
in that other land here he was a queer
old gentleman who had plenty of money
but thought more of a scrap of parch-
ment than of a government bond his
only son philander was die very op-
posite

  from some mysterious source philander
had acquired an intensely commercial
spirit allied with a grotesque sense of
humor philander met philips mother
at dodworth hall new york when
artemus ward lectured there

  philips mother had observed philan-
der in the throes of exquisite mirth over
little points which escaped a large part
of the audience philanders laughter
was so human so genuine so infectious
that the great humorist finally fixed him
with his eye and said in his melancholy
manner 

   i would remind the jovial gentle-
man in the third row that i did not come
here to be laughed at	v

  that completely finished philander
sand and philips mother-to-be
treasure of the world	

laughed too-not at a ward but at
the jovial gentleman in the third row
and remarked to her own father that  a
man who can laugh like that must be a
pleasant person to live with

  from her gentleness of spirit-for
a ward was the matchmaker-philip
acquired his philosophic thoughtful
temperament from his father he ac-
quired good sense and that irresistible
sense of humor but the predominating
strain of his character was the intro-
spective way of his grandfather septi-
mus together with that old gentlemans
love of lore pictures of the past and
the glamour of book-life

  after philanders death - philips
mother died when the boy was young-
the lad found himself the last of the
sands the commercial philander had
left a fortune invested which philip
left to take care of itself

   unfortunately others took care of it
while philip fished smoked his pipe
and in the evenings explored his grand-
fathers dog-eared treasures the for-
tune suddenly collapsed crashing to
earth so violently that it carried the
house of sand with it philip saved the
old books and curios and went to work
but he was not built for commerce

  he remained away from business for
days at a time he felt ill although he
was not sure whether his illness was tem-
peramental or physical now he knew
it was both

  here was his position he was with-
out a tie in the world his heart was
whole and untrammeled he was free
to roam the wide world but the first
move meant car fare at least and car
fare was scarce

  he was unfitted for drudgery by tem-
perament and now he was unfitted phys-
ically he had contracted the disease
that means immediate cessation of con-
finement what was he to do

   in short reflected philip  i am
of no use to any one i ought perhaps
to commit suicide but  have such a
faculty for enjoying life that i see no
use ia cutting off my nose if i only
bad enough money to make the last year
worth while  feel so fine

  his idea of making the last year
worth while was not that of despera-
tion the white lights and the reckless

glad suicide did not appeal to him he
wanted to live-a healthy spirited life

  in other days he had vowed to travel
but like the man who did not read
dickens until he was sixty he kept that
joy until his mind was mature and he
might be fully appreciative of the world
that he was to see and study

  now he called himself a fool for not
having traveled while he had the money
now that life was a matter of three hun-
dred and sixty-five days or less the blue
seas had a strange fascination and the
spring air of the park suggested green
islands with coral beaches and opal in-
shore waters

  couldnt it be done there was only
one thing which was an asset - his
insurance unfortunately that fifty
thousand dollars would not be available
for ten years unless he died in the
meantime true he might cash in the
policies

  they should be-worth something after
ten years they were on the twenty-
year payment plan but they would hard-
ly be worth a sum large enough for an
extended tour of the world with never
a thought of cast-for the year must be
free from all worry and the year must
embrace everything worth seeing worth
tasting worth experiencing

  there were so many things that he
would like to see taste and experience-
the many things he had planned when
he reveled in the romantic suggestions of
his grandfathers old papers recently
he had been reading an old book about
panama

  he would like to see panama-not
the canal works but the ghost pan-
ama from the spaniard with his trains
of ingot-laden mules and the buccaneers
with their red cutlasses and firebrands
down to the gold - crazed immigrants
sinking beneath the yellow scourge along
the jungle trail

  then philip sand sank into a day-
dream as he so often did but this day-
dream had an idea through it he im-
agined he was back in the old library
again a rotting old ledger which was
now in his bedroom in forty-ninth
street was open before him it was an
old log-book which his grandfather had
picked up somewhere

  the author of that log-book and the


the railroad mans magazine

ship whose journeyings and adventures
it chronicled were not known to fame
but the book was a fine specimen of a
sailors diary it contained besides po-
sitions and weather remarks the philo-
sophic reflections of a lonely captain

  on one page as philip recalled was
an attempt at poetry - a fragmentary
piean in praise of somebodys good looks

    wherever i go  the raging main

     see your brown eyes martha lane

  and  another page there was an
account-cruelly realistic in its very
crudeness-of the death of the ships
boy harry breakspar and of his burial
at sea-and dick gibby the ships
sweetheart blubbered like a babby

  but the page that arose before philip
sands mental eyes as he sat  the park
bench was worded something like this

    gibbys father sailed with him and lie
  told gibby that the treasure was still
  where they putt it the buccaneers never
  buried treasure in the pacific the at-
  lantic was handier near england gibby
  says it was never put down so the story
  got wrong by word of mouth it never
  were putt  the cocos islands at all
  gibby says it were putt  the caicos
  which islands are among the bahama
  reefs and hard to find because they are
  changing names all the time it may be
  true i think gibbys right and his
  father sailed with him the pig jumpt
  overboard this morning

   it may be true i think it is
and gibbys father sailed with him
echoed philip without knowing or car-
ing much who gibbys father was or
with whom he sailed

  philip remembered the day his grand-
father septimus showed him that pas-
sage to old septimus the matter of
knowing where a million dollars worth
of treasure might be lying around did
not matter much it only pleased the
old gentleman to think that a secret like
that enhanced the value of the curious
log-book

  many a time philip had turned to
that page and studied the communica-
tion of gibby the thing was like an
opiate that lulled him to romantic day-
dreams in his dreaming he had seen
the old captain writing with his tongue

out the words that gibby had told him
then he had drifted back to the bucca-
neers and the galleon and the sea-fight

  lie knew quite well that it was a hard
engagement lasting all day and the
scuppers poured blood which clotted as
it trickled down to the water and he
knew that the pirates boarded the span-
iard made the dons walk the plank ill-
used the women broke into the stores
and got drunk transshipped the treasure
of peruvian ingots and miscellaneous
loot and sailed away after scuttling the
dona maria del something or other

  they may have set fire to it but
philip knew better they scuttled it
he saw them do it

  by and by they came to the island-
the caicos they took the treasure
ashore and buried it philip knew the
spot quite well he had seen them
bury the treasure he had helped pile
the ingots himself and gibbys father
had got very drunk and shot a dog
which wasnt harming anybody gibbys
father was as coarse a man as ever
broached a rum puncheon

  then they had a great barbecue and
lei i asleep  the island when they were
hoarse with singing and unable to stand
on their legs for another jig and
gibbys father fell in the fire and the
smell of burning flesh awoke him and
he spat in the fire to show his contempt
for its entire proceedings

  philip sand awoke the ducks on
the lake were quacking he had thought
they were wild ducks in the swamp in-
side the beach  but they were quite tame
and a little girl was throwing broken
crackers to them the green was still
 the trees the air was wine-like and
living as ever and a policeman in a new
uniform was strutting along the walk
swinging his locust on a thong twisted
about his wrist

  if only he could go after that treasure
-not for the treasures sake but for
the joy of the dream if only he had
the money which had been his a year
before he would charter a steam-
yacht and a crew and sail in search of
that island which he knew so well and
he would go to that spot where his own
hands had piled ingots and where he
had helped gibbys father to his feet
he felt sure that the burned spot where
treasure of the world



the barbecue had been held must still
show

  the call of life was growing stronger
every minute money  money he
must have money and again that
mocking fifty-thousand-dollar bond arose
before him and it pointed a mocking

	at him as much as to say

   you can have all the s but the
 is not available until you are dead i
do you understand-dead and youll
be dead in a year and it will all go
to some one you never heard of

  philip rose to his feet and began to
walk rapidly through the park was
there no way he could get some of that
money fie would mortgage his soul 
a pound of flesh  his life like faust or
lorenzo to the devil or shylock or any-
body who cared to have it

  surely there was some shylock who
would be willing to make a fabulous
profit on a years investment surely
any business man whose practical mind
overlooked silly sentiment would take a
plunge on a man whose death in a year
would mean fifty thousand dollars hard
cash

  philip sand stopped short- at a point
where two paths diverged he had ar-
rived somewhere and the two paths sug-
gested the pause he had solved the
problem he would mortgage his life
the mortgage to be foreclosed at his
death or in three hundred and sixty-fi-e
days

   the other mans profit mattered little
to him as long as he philip sand could
raise enough to go treasure-hunting to
sail the seas taste the salt air feel the
vessel sway and heave on the billows see
the green islands and the coral beaches
and opal waters

  to find the other man that was
all presently philip sand took the path
to the right walking rapidly toward the
park exit he had remembered a name

-	the name -of a shylock-merton
scragg

        chapter ii
        the gamblers

merton scragg had the repu-
tation of being the meanest man
in the united states whether he was

or not the title was his and it is the kind
of reputation that is easier to maintain
than lose

  of course the mans name was against
him so was his appearance a man
with the name of scragg could not fail
to be mean any more than a gamaliel
simpkins could achieve military glory

  merton scragg looked the character
that was popularly attributed to him
he was tall big-boned lantern-jawed
and hungry-looking there was how-
ever a kindly eye in the mans head
those who had seen that eye when it
was not fixed upon a victim with steely
gray-blue keenness declared that old
merton was  a good soul at bottom

  whatever might be the truth of it it
was common gossip that scragg would
never buy a newspaper if he could pick
one up that had been dropped in a
steenth avenue car a steenth avenue
car is particularly mentioned because
merton scragg owned the franchise and
the car-line that ran on steenth avenue

  although the steenth avenue cars did
not run within twelve blocks of the
mans wall street office scragg would
walk the intervening distance in order to
save a nickel or at least to prevent any
other street-car company from getting
the five cents

  perhaps there was even some founda-
tion for the story that scragg would not
even pay his nickel on his own line the
conductors knew him and never dared
ask for it

  it is possible that there was a great
deal of pure fiction about the stories told
of scraggs meannesses for the mans
life was as close as his fist was said to be

  however all that may be the man at-
tended strictly to his own business turned
over every cent until it became two ap-
peared at his office every morning at ten
sharp worked steadily until five in the
afternoon went up-town in a steenth
avenue car as far as it would take him
and then disappeared until next morn-
ing when the car would pick him up at
the same crossing

  he was enormously wealthy there
could be no doubt of that the man
who had never been caught in the mar-
ket for any large amount the man who
was never known to spend a penny on
luxuries and who even wore a celluloid


the railroad mans magazine

collar the man who had saved and in-
vested every cent since he made ten dol-
lars out of a brush and a tin of shoe-
polish was certain to have a large capital
somewhere and never by word or action
did he deny it himself

  just where and how merton scragg
lived no one seemed to know or care
as the old skinflint refused to make him-
self interesting in the public mind he
even escaped the attentions of that creator
of personal interest the sunday news-
paper

  in the directory he appeared as
 scragg merton - wall street and
that was all if his residence appeared
in the directory it must have been under
some other name

  about noon that day merton scragg
was about to put on his faded green
derby hat and slip around to a quick-
lunch for the coffee and buns which con-
stituted his midday meal when his clerk
handed him mr philip sands card

   show mr sand in said scragg
scratching his chin

  from a pigeon-hole in his brain he
drew data regarding the sand family
and glanced over it on the instant he
knew the sands for an honorable quiet
family although he was under the im-
pression that they were all dead the
last he had heard of them was when the
sand estate had gone smash in the panic
and-ah yes -there was a son this
was the son

   how-do mr sand said he coldly
waving a long bony hand in the direc-
tion of a prim straight-backed wooden
chair that chair was a part of
scraggs business policy if the busi-
ness was important the caller would not
mind its discomfort if otherwise it
urged scraggs inhospitable reception

   what can i have the pleasure of do
ing for you mr sand

    wish to borrow twenty thousand
dollars mr scragg said philip his
eyes bright and his manner slightly nerv-
ous

   i art not a money-lender mr sand
said merton coldly  did you wish to
sell me a bond

   yes-that is to say i wish to raise
twenty thousand dollars on a bond which
will be worth fifty thousand dollars
within a year 

   you have the bond with you 

take it 

  philip laid the insurance policy on the
financiers desk scragg took it up and
examined it with cold eyes for a few
minutes then he folded it up replaced
it in its envelope and handed it back to
sand with the remark

   this policy will not lie mature for
ten years unless you should happen to
die in the meantime

   unless i should happen to die in the
meantime echoed philip quietly  mr
scragg  shall explain my position

  he did he pointed out that he had
been given one year to live he wished
to enjoy that year of life fie had no
assets save his policy which was a per-
fectly sound bond he had no relatives
near or dear enough to whom he would
care to will the fifty thousand dollars

  mr scragg might have the balance of
thirty thousand dollars as well as any
one else and more than any one else if
he would be- willing to speculate to the
extent of twenty thousand dollars would
mr scragg be willing to advance that
sum 

   suppose you did not die  said mer-
ton scragg coolly

   i have little fear-hope of that
said sand  i have tuberculosis of the
lungs and the first specialist in the city
has given me twelve months

   but suppose you did not die re-
iterated scragg monotonously

  philip was silent he- had not thought
of this possibility save in connection
with lauristons many unfulfilled proph-
ecies in his own case he had no
doubt of the truth of the physicians
prediction

   there of course is the risk said
he feebly

   which i am not prepared to take
said scragg with a note of finality and
dismissal

  philip rose to his feet but he prompt-
ly sat down again his face slightly pale
and his lips compressed

   if there was no risk-you would be
willing 

  scragg glanced at him for the fraction
of a second

     do not care to commit myself to a
definite reply to that question he said
calmly   do not quite understand
treasure of the world

    mr scragg said philip in sr tone of
  anxiety and sincerity  i came to you
  because you had many business dealings
  with my late father you know that
  my name is synonymous with honorable
  business methods i may have more
  than a year to live but at present i have
  no available money  am willing to
  take the risk of being alive three hundred
  n and sixtv-five days from now if you
  are

     you are willing to take the risk
 said scragg speak plainly mr sand
 he added almost peevishly

     there is no suicide clause in that
 policy said philip quietly

   merton scragg frowned and quickly
 replied

    you ask me mr sand to compound
 a felony

    i do nothing of the sort said
 philip sharply  there is only a per-
 sonal principle involved and it does not
 concern your hereafter for the rest
 the insurance company which issues a
 policy advertised as without lien or spe-
 cial clause is merely speculating in one
 of the many ways of speculation

    mm mm   hummed merton scragg
 looking at the wall with an interested
 light in his gray-blue eyes he was si-
 lent for a full minute then he said
  what then do you propose 

     i propose to make over to you this
 insurance better still in considera-
 tion of twenty thousand dollars received

 i propose to draw up a will leaving my
 entire estate to you  am also willing
 to enter into any contract which you may
 wish to make in which i shall agree to
 be dead before the expiration of three
 hundred-and sixty-five days

    merton scragg turned his steely eyes
 upon the younger man when lie spoke
 his tones were clear-cut and significant

     you agree to be dead it was more
 a statement than a question

    i do i will sign a paper to that
 effect

   not with my consent said scragg
 incisively  such a contract would be
 of no use to me and would not be up-
 held by any reputable court besides
 which the existence of such a document
 would help you more than me should
 our interests clash at the end of the
 period suggested

   	rr

   i hope you do not mean to insin-
uate- began philip

   tut tut  scragg exclaimed wa-
ving an impatient hand  i never in-
sinuate but life is sweet-even to me
mr sand and he smiled a slight sad
smile  that was not in my mind
indeed your word is worth more than
your bond if you are still of the same
mind i shall accept the risk mr sand

  you-you will accept stammered
poor philip for a moment his brain
was awliirl between the prospect of his
dream being fulfilled and the certainty
of his doom the seal of which he was
about to affix with his own hand

  i think that was what i said mr
sand you will please to draw up your
will naming me as sole legatee and sole
executor you will also please leave this
insurance bond in my safe in return i
shall give you twenty thousand dollars
in cash the condition of the transaction
being that you will be dead before the
expiration of a year

    meaning of course that if  should
not die naturally-

   mr sand i think we have said
enough said scragg coldly

    very well said philip shrugging
his shoulders  i was only proposing
fairness to you can we close the trans-
action now 

   no it is my lunch hour said
scragg firmly  but i shall be back
in- he looked at the dollar watch
again and made a calculation -in
seventeen minutes

  so saying merton scragg put the
faded green derby hat on bis head and
held open the door for his client a
few minutes later as the financier walked
swiftly up the street on his daily coffee-
and-buns routine philip standing on the
steps of the office building watched his
progress with a queer desire to laugh

    i wonder he wanted to say aloud
 what that queer old skinflint would say
if he met gibbys father 

chapter iii

chasing a dream

t hilip sand had the blessed
faculty of making the best of
things by the time he had the check


the railroad mans magazine

for twenty thousand dollars in his hands
he had quite dismissed the fact that lie
had mortgaged his life to merton scragg
and possibly his soul to the devil

  he gave as little thought to the moral
as to the material aspect of the matter
all he cared to remember was that he
had twenty thousand dollars his to do
with as he saw fit that he had at least
the present in which to enjoy himself
thoroughly and that to-morrow would
take care of itself even if next year did
not

  naturally the man who had dreamed
the dream of gibbys father and the
treasure was an adept at the game of
 make-believe for the first few
hours after he received the check from
merton sjrragg philip just wandered
about the streets of the city thinking
from the loftiness of his suddenly and
queerly acquired wealth what fools these
other mortals were

  he found himself wondering what in-
terest those worry-faced persons found
in life the same old drudgery day after
day month after month year after year
better a year of sheer life-spirited liv-
ing-than a half-century of this droning
prosaic existence what if death came
at the end of the year

   i will have lived at least quoth
philip to himself  sooner or later
theyll die too- unfreed as arnold
says  having seen nothing still un-
blest 

  it may be difficult for some persons to
understand the spirit which was upon
philip sand that clay when all his doubts
had become certainty when by the ac-
ceptance of the twenty thousand dollars
which was to make life pleasant he had
sealed his doom either by natural death
or suicide it was the spirit of the
french patriots who ate drank and
were merry the night before they rode in
the tumbrels it was the spirit of the
man who having determined to commit
suicide decides to spend the interval in
amusing violations of the law

  such a man is dead as far as the
worlds concerns are his he can look
upon human foibles with tolerant indul-
gence the old ache of life has gone
from him for with one fell resolution he
has wiped out the source of all aches
between the acceptance of i-ate with

the attending resignation and the execu-
tion of bis resolve such a man is as free
from the little discomforts of life as a
condemned prisoner who can have what
he likes for breakfast  the day of his
star performance in the electric-chair or
on the ropes-end

  there was nothing desperate however
about philip sands state of mind he
was on the other hand quite interested
quite amused quite satisfied with the
condition of affairs he felt that he
had made an excellent bargain with mer-
ton scragg and that scragg had made
an excellent bargain with him

  if any one was to suffer it would be
philip sand and philip sand was de-
lighted at the development of the busi-
ness the prisoner was having his un-
expected luxurious breakfast and the
ham and eggs tasted good

  for hours he continued to walk about
the streets the shop windows attract-
ed him as they would attract a child or
an overgrown boy the sun was shining
with spring fervor and the world was
good

  philip strolled along the water-front
late in the afternoon and here his en-
joyment of the first delights of the ven-
ture reached its highest he smelled
the river and the sea he caught a whiff
of rum at one wharf west indian spices
at another new zealand kauri at a third
and the air was always tanged with the
odor of pitch resin and pine

  it was one of the most adventurous
day-dreams philip sand had ever enjoyed
when he returned to his room in the
evening the dream was as a continued
story through which paraded the old
captain-with the log-book under his arm
and his tongue stuck out and spanish
dons and pirates and harry breakspar
who was always dying to the tune of a
shipmates  blubbering and of course
gibbys father drank rum and swore all
night until philip sand lost patience
with the old scamp and woke up laugh-
ing

  philips first reflection next morning
was that  action  must be the motto of
the days doings he had drained the
cup to the dregs now he must have
a little taste of material pleasures

  he wondered how he would go about
the business of chartering a steam-yacht
treasure of the world



he might go into the office of some ship-
ping-man and clear his throat and say
quite coolly-for there was no use hem-
ming and hawing about a necessary piece
of business

  i want a reliable steam-yacht also
a steady captain and a sober industrious
crew when can they be ready

  then philip had to laugh heartily
for that grotesque heritage of his prompt-
ly made the imaginary shippiug-man an-
swer 

   why certainly thomas show the
gentleman a few steam - yachts and
possibly sir we might show you a string
orchestra although perhaps you would
prefer a steam-calliope

  and yet philip sand thanked god that
he was a dreamer with a sense of humor
he lives who dreams and has the blessed
faculty of risibility every detail of his
doings in the three hundred and sixty-
four days to come must be fraught with
similar delight and so they were at
least at the beginning from the negotia-
tions for the steam-yacht to the inter-
views with the yachts captain to whom
he whispered the magic word

   treasure 

  the only cloud on philips horizon
these days was that things moved too
fast not that every moment was not
fraught with pleasure interest and quiet
excitement but his twenty thousand dol-
lars oiled the wheels too well the
yacht was chartered with despatch and
ease the steady captain and the sober
industrious crew appeared as by magic
i n two weeks all was ready yet up to
this time there had not been the shadow
of a difficulty or the least sign of a vil-
lains entry it did seem to philip that
a villain was all that was required to
complete the cast of the play which
was about to begin

  that was the reflection of the playful
philip the grandson of the dreamv
septimus but the son of the practical
philander thought better and more wise-
ly not even to captain pearce of the
steam-yacht chameleon did he divulge
the secret of the treasures real where-
abouts

   we are going to hunt for the cocos
island treasure said he to the ship-
master  i have a chart which differs
in many respects from the alleged charts

and plans and dying statements upon
which so many vain attempts to recover
gold have been made but for the pres-
ent captain  am sure you will agree
with me that  had best keep my infor-
mation to myself-at least until we are
at sea

   quite right sir said pearce

 sealed orders tell no tales in port

   the cocos islands are about a few
hundred miles to the west of panama
are they not

   about seven hundred sir-roughly
speaking

   vnd as the canal is not yet cut
through it will be necessary for us to
make the long voyage through the strait
of magellan

   yes sir it was not my business
sir added pearce  but i wondered
when you first spoke of the cocos island
treasure why you chartered a yacht here
instead of at frisco say

   i have a very good reason for my
course captain pearce said philip with
a smile that reason i will reveal to
you when we are at sea besides that
if we were going to the cocos islands
and started from panama bay on the
pacific side our destination and plans
would be suspected especially as at this
moment i learn by the newspapers there
are no less than two other parties engaged
in the hunt for the cocos island treas-
ure

  captain pearce nodded his head wise-
ly pie wondered just what that differ-
ing information as to location of the
treasure might be but he asked no
questions

   my plan then said philip finally

 is this you will proceed at once-
without me i shall join you at colon
in a week or ten days when  hope you
will have the chameleon spick and span

i	hate worry captain pearce and the
run to colon will give you an oppor-
tunity of getting in sea-going ship-
shape

   aye aye sir said pearce thinking
that he understood the rich mans hor-
ror of the breaking-in process in a
week or ten days you will come by the
regular steamer i take it

   by the regular weekly steamer-the
latin - america line i should be
aboard the chameleon in ten days


the railroad mans magazine

 next day the chameleon sailed out
of sandy hook and nosed south cap-
tain pearce filled with satisfaction for
this was a  soft job -no loading no
bickering with customs agents super-
cargoes etc nothing but fine-weather
sailing fat living white decks paint
and polished brasswork and there was
always good pay a spice of romance
and maybe a bit of money on the treas-
ure although not for a moment did
pearce dream that philip sand had any
more definite information as to an in-
definite treasure than scores of others
who had tried for it and failed

  philip laughed heartily the evening of
the chameleons day of sailing when he
picked up a late afternoon yellow and
read a  full  account of the yachts
departure and her proposed destination

     it was learned on good authority
  said the newspaper in that pompous
  this-is-a-true-story style which defeats
  veracity  that the chameleon will touch
  at colon for supplies then  sail for the
  azores although it is a fact that she
  will sail through the strait of magellan
  and head for the cocos islands in search
  of the spanish treasure buried there

    the yacht has been chartered by a
  private company composed of new
  yorkers several of whom- are well
  known in social and club circles

     every effort has been made to keep
  the yachts real destination and purpose
  secret but when it was learned that the
  cocos islands figured in her itinerary it
  was easilv surmised that the azores was
  a blind

   good   laughed philip  i knew
it would leak pearce and his men will
leak some more at colon and then-
ho for the caicos was there ever a
treasure - hunt or a treasure - story that
didnt leak its human nature and
pearce is just human

  two days later philip sand sailed on
the latin-america liner revuelan for
colon it was perfect weather and
when the sun is shining upon a quiet sea
thereis no more soothing thing to the
spirit than the white decks and polished
rails of a tropic-bound steamer the
very course of the ship suggests that the
days will grow in beauty calm and sun-
shine

 from the old log-book philip had

torn not without a qualm the leaf of
the diary pertaining to what gibbys
father told gibby and what gibby told
the captain who wrote the ptean in
praise of martha lanes brown eyes

  there were only four women on the
ship one was a negress bound for
colon another a chilean lady on her
way to valparaiso via panama the
other two were americans-a miss ve-
rina harding and a miss sharpe ap-
parently miss sharpe was the young
womans mentor chaperon and com-
panion  for at seemly intervals she
checked miss hardings spirits with a
stern face and an unutterably reproach-
ful

   verina 

  there were a number of male passen-
gers most of them were very ordinary
mortals-some so ordinary that they
were interesting there was a jamaica
orange - planter with asthma who
wheezed out his opinion that the amer-
ican tariff was ruining the jamaica fruit
trade there was an automobile agent
who paced the deck at a furious gait
trying to accelerate the speed of  this
old tub

  there was a venezuelan who pro-
claimed himself  the cattle prince of
south america and raved of the day
when a south american league would
wipe the gringos off the southern con-
tinent  and there was an english engi-
neer bound for bolivia who listened
patiently to the  prince and said
 really that is most interesting

  but the character which appealed
most to philip sands sense of the ridi-
culous was a little  drummer who
gloried in the name of mr theodore
higgs higgs was about five feet four
inches in height and he was built in
proportion he had the tongue of a
remnant salesman and the nimbleness of
a dancing-master

    i am sole representative for south
america and the west indies said he
to philip sand  of the kurve-kut
korset and the no-kut klip i see you
use the ordinary clip for your tie mr
sand dont do it it spoils the silk
of the scarf and bites into the material
of the shirt-front

  	use the no-kut and you will effect
a saving in linen it can be used as a
treasure of the world



tie-clip a sleeve-clip and can be
attached to the ordinary gentlemans
garter without damage to the sox not
doing business aboard ship of course 
but let me present you with a no-kut
klip

   good lord i wish you were a
woman  he exclaimed on another oc-
casion you see that miss harding
lliggs rolled his eyes and moistened his
lips with his tongue  can you beat
that take in the lines of that womans
figure observe the sweep from the tip
of the bust to the curve of the hip

   she wears the wrong corset though
if she only knew it if that girl wore
a kurve-kut she would have the whole
ship at her feet the kurve-kut does
not compress the figure it merely holds
the outline of the natural shape it
yields to the movement of the body with-
out creasing or wrinkling the garments
it can be worn to the same advantage
with the thickest traveling costume or
the flimsiest silk miss anna held-

    dont think miss harding would
appreciate your public enthusiasm my
dear mr higgs said philip with the
greatest good-nature have a cigar

   i wonder what that man finds in
life philip asked the taffrail ten min-
utes later

  two days later however it became ap-
parent to philip that even the meanest
of iods creatures have ambitions he
was strolling along the deck when he
suddenly came upon miss harding and
theodore fliggs miss sharpe was in
her berh seasick and thus the hand-
some american was unprotected from
the rather personal enthusiasm of the
kurve-kut korset man

  higgs as philip came upon the scene
was talking volubly and drawing
demonstrative parallels with his hands
miss harding was standing up her face
burning with blushes and her lips mov-
ing between tremulous embarrassment
and angry but vain articulation

  philip took in the situation at a
glance walking rapidly to her side
he almost shouldered mr higgs out of
the way and raised his yachting-cap

   pardon me lie said to the lady
 miss harding i believe you must
really come forward and see the flying-
fish-shoals of them  hope you dont

 mind my introducing myself ship-
 board etiquette you know

   he laughed miss harding looked
 into his eyes with a swift giance of
 gratitude she understood next mo-
 ment her arm was in his and they were
 walking toward the bow uf the steamer

   later in the day higgs came upon
 philip by the rail the treasure-hunter
 had been indulging in a day-dream in
 which was a strain of the agony of
 tantalus

   say old fellow said mr higgs
 familiarly  that was a mean trick you
 played me 

   it was an inopportune moment for the
 agent of the kurve-kut korset a
 hitherto undreamed-of ferocity suddenly
 leaped into philips heart he turned
 around caught fliggss chin between his
 right forefinger and thumb gave it a
  sharp jerk and said

    sir you are an unspeakable cad  

       chapter iv
       a disaster at sea

af iss verina harding was
quite unconscious that her good
looks had stirred enmity in the hearts
of two of natures noblemen although
in her mind there was no comparison
between the unspeakable higgs and the
tall refined gentlemanly person with the
amused eyes and the quiet smile one
was a cur the other a mastiff

   sand interested miss harding that
 he was a gentleman in the strict sense
 of the word she had no doubt there
 was a formal informality about his do-
 ings that stamped him as a man of hab-
 itual refinement and there is nothing of
 stronger appeal to a womans gentle na-
 ture than this

   fie was handsome too in a quiet un-
 obtrusive way he was hardly the man
 a maiden would sigh over o nights
 philip sand grew upon the senses rather
 than burst upon them his quiet humor
 too left a feeling of light-heartedness
 which somehow made ones outlook on
 life pleasant

   he was a delightful person to travel
 with as miss verina soon discovered
 he had a gift of word-painting in one
 suggestive sentence he could depict a


the railroad mans magazine

fellow passengers whole life - history
peculiarities and personality that is
he drew a vague line across the canvas
of the mind and the mind unconsciously
finished the picture

  then too he had such a delightful
way of being sentimental he did not
enthuse over anything verbally he
would grunt something about the stars
and succeed in producing the wide si-
lences upon the senses or after a long
silence broken abruptly by one resonant
note of the ships bell he would lift
his head and say half jocularly half
reverently

   and the lights are burning bright
sir 

  miss harding herself was quite a
mystery to philip but no less was he a
mystery to her her intuition divined
an unusual something about this man
sometimes he seemed a thing apart from
worldly things especially did she feel
this when she was not with him but
watching him as he sat alone

  but what puzzled her most was the
smiling attention which he sometimes
bestowed upon a ragged piece of yellow
paper which he would reverently draw
from an inside pocket

 naturally her gratitude was his for
she instinctively felt that his masculine
power had been exerted on her behalf
mr higgs did not attempt to speak to
her again although she sometimes caught
the korset mans wide animal eyes fixed
upon her in a disconcerting manner
and she also noticed and understood
that mr higgs had developed a fearful
respect for the quiet mr sand

  philip himself was no less puzzled
over miss harding that that was her
name he had learned from the passenger-
list whether miss sharpe was the
young womans aunt or servant he could
not decide miss harding treated the
elderly spinster with good - natured hu-
mor as she might treat a privileged serv-
ant or a peculiarly constituted relative
while miss sharpe played the harmless
tyrant with her charge

  sand spent a good many hours of the
second and third days in miss hard-
ings company so long as the conver-
sation was of a general nature she was
a delightful shipmate but as soon as
the talk drifted into the deep waters as

on an ocean voyage it somehow will be-
tween comparative strangers she adroit-
ly swam back into the shallows if miss
sharpe did not drag her back with that
absurdly reproachful warning

   vcrina

  several times philip incomprehensibly
anxious to know something of the young
womans life and antecedents ashore re-
vealed some personal details of himself
having said that he was bound for co-
lon he succeeded in ascertaining that
miss harding and her elderly companion
were paying a touring visit to jamaica

   i expect to join the yacht chame-
leon at colon philip continued bait-
fully  and do some cruising

  miss harding turned her head slowly
and stared at him

   the yacht chameleon  she said
in slow amazement

  philip felt embarrassed he had not
meant to convey that he was rich enough
to charter one of the finest yachts afloat
but miss harding added quietly

   oh you mean mr merton scraggs
yacht 

  whose exclaimed philip

   vcrina  rasped miss sharpe

  philip thought for a moment he
had learned the name of the chame-
leons owner and had forgotten it
anyhow it was not scragg although
he thought lie ought to remember the
name of the person from whose agents
he had chartered the yacht it had a
familiar ring now that he had forgot-
ten it

   i think you must have in nynd an-
other yacht of the same name said he
 the owners name was not scragg
also i would be surprised to hear that
merton scragg owned a yacht  have
had personal dealings with merton
scragg he added almost bitterly

  miss hardings face was a study for
a moment presently she concluded the
incident with the remark

   probably you are right although
mr scragg if he is the same person
does own a yacht  have been his guest
aboard her	 -

  philip said no more although he was
chuckling in his mind over the incon-
gruous possibility of skinflint scragg in
a white yachting-cap with a nautical
swagger and an up-aloft voice it was
treasure of the vvorid

ail absurd idea of course but the in-
cident served to deepen the mystery of
miss harding and his interest in her

  his interest in her was not without a
growing sense of pain if lie had been
a well man with years of life before
him philip sand might have questioned
his interest in miss harding she was
the finest woman he had ever met both
mentally and physically

  mr higgs had not been wrong in his
estimate of her bodily charms but al-
lied with them was something which
mr higgs was incapable of appre-
ciating she was a young woman of
character

  she was intellectual without being
masculine on her broad brow was
pride and in her eyes was modesty and
tender kindliness while her mouth ex-
pressed strength with feminine softness
philip liked her because she was not
helpless but no less of a helpless wom-
an on that account

  on the morning of the fourth day of
the revuelans voyage south philip sand
arose from his berth after a restless
night he determined as he put on his
clothes that he would have nothing to
do with miss harding to-day his in-
terest in her was becoming too marked
at least to himself it caused him the
first bitterness of his mortgaged life to
discover that there was one happiness in
which he might not dabble during the re-
maining days of his year and that was
the supreme happiness-love

  he was not in love with miss harding
-yet and to-day he was going to
make sure that there was no danger of
such a catastrophe to-day the revue-
lan would enter the bahamas and to-day
philip sand would attend strictly to the
business that had brought him a sailing

  immediately after breakfast he ob-
tained the captains permission-in the
form of an angled invitation-to come
up on the bridge in an hour the cap-
tain - captain rodgers - expected to
raise san salvador nr watlings is-
land as columbuss landing - place is
written on the maps

  what philip really wanted to have a
look at was the captains chart in or-
der to inform himself as to the approxi-
mate position and distance of the caicos
islands hitherto he had been unable to



find the islands under that name when
watlings island was raised the captain
a queer bit of humanity began an un-
solicited discourse

   i never see that island mr sand
said he waving his hand over the bows
 but i think of the wonders of the
lord

    they that go down to the sea in
ships and do business in great waters 
quoted philip gravely-  these see the
works of the lord 

  ah said captain rodgers ap-
provingly  you read the scriptures 
see encouraged by such sympathetic
piety he rambled on about how in these
very waters in sight of that very island
where at night a lighthouse beams in
place of the indian torch the thankful
salve regina of the spaniards was raised
to the listening skies america was dis-
covered although as captain rodgers
added slyly if there hadnt been a light
that dark night america might have
discovered columbus

  philip smiled obligingly he was pic-
turing the captain on each and every
voyage perpetrating the same joke to
some honored passenger on the bridge

   the bahamas are a queer group
said he like a schoolmaster who repeats
the same lesson to succeeding classes
 at one time there was no caribbean
sea no gulf of mexico wild indians
roved over the face of the waters then
came a great earthquake-a great sink-
ing-and a third of the entire western
hemisphere sank beneath the waves

   to-day concluded the nautical
schoolmaster  all that is left of that
large portion of rich continent are the
mountain tops that are now low-lying is-
lands - a range of mountain-peaks
stretching from the tip of florida to the
shoulder of south america and between
them a great pocket of water which es-
capes in what we call the gulf stream

   that gulf stream formed by the
lords mighty hand influences all eu-
rope makes england habitable makes-
quartermaster  he broke off with prac-
tical sharpness sing out when watling
lighthouse is abeam

   i would like to see that pn the map
said philip inncicently  of course
ive often seen it before but now it
means-differently


the railroad mans magazine

  the captain fell into the trap he
led the way to the chart-room eager to
show his appreciative pupil  the works
of the lord he unrolled a chart of
the bahamas showing also the coast of
cuba santo domingo and porto rico

   this is where we are now said
rodgers pointing to the eastern end of
watlings island

  philip sand studied the chart he
felt like the villain in a treasure story
right in the ships course were a number
of islands with clear water threading
among them there would be rum
cay to the right and long island then
fortune island to the left and acklin
island then a speck called castle is-
land with clear water to little and
great inagua islands on the port side-
and then cuba

  his was the course as captain rod-
gers traced it discoursing all the while

   this afternoon we will pass fortune
island said he  and in the night we
will pass castle island or as it is called
bird rock light i hope the weather
is fine for when it blows this passage is
one of the worst in the world im
afraid we will have a noisy passage
through it is too bright to-day glit-
tering sunshine like this is a bad sign
hereabout

  but philip was not listening his
eyes were fixed on a spattering of pin-
head islands to the southeast of castle
island his heart was beating like a
riveters hammer for the name printed
over them was caicos islands

   how is this he said pointing to
the little cloud of pin-heads  i never
heard of these islands before-at least
i dont remember ever seeing that name
on a map of the west indies

   ah  said captain rodgers pre-
paring for another discourse  this
chart like all charts is accurate these
are the caicos islands although on ordi-
nary maps and in the speech they are
called the turks islands just as san
salvadore is called watlings island
they are continually changing names-
these islands

  philip started he looked up at the
captain and expected to see him with his
tongue out but all he said was after the
manner of the english engineer

    that is most interesting  

   watling light abeam sir hailed
the quartermaster

  the captain hurriedly excused him-
self and philip was left alone with a
forefinger placed upon the caicos island

  late in the afternoon fortune island
was raised on the port bow philip had
found enough in his own thoughts and
in the glimpses of passing islands to oc-
cupy his attention to the partial exclu-
sion of miss harding his mind was
filled with the romance of treasure

  the inshore opal of the waters around
fortune island was rapidly changing to
varying shades of angry green blue-
black and white-gray presently a mist
came over the sea in less than half an
hour fortune island had vanished and
the revuelan was driving over a sea that
was as flat as a billiard-board and
churned white as milk

  at first it was believed to be one of the
passing squalls which are common
enough among the islands and which
sometimes attain a dangerous velocity
but as a second squall more ferocious
than the first was followed by a third
and a fourth which finally developed into
a growing gale the outlook for the night
in the island passage became grave

   there is nothing to worry about
ladies said captain rodgers to miss
sharp and miss harding taking his seat
at the supper-table as usual  we will
have castle island light before mid-
night and then the weather will abate
and you will be able to sleep comfortably
it is the mighty sea confined in this lit-
tle space that makes such a protest

  in the middle of the supper captain
rodgers after a mighty list of the steam-
er to port excused himself and went on
deck that was the last ever seen of
captain rodgers

  when philip sand returned to the
deck lie caught the terrible whisper as it
went from lip to lip from bridge to
stokehole the captain was missing
when a man is missing aboard ship dur-
ing heavy weather no question is asked

  philip sand felt his spine creep as he
heard the rumor the self-satisfied man
of the bridge the paternal simpleton of
the supper-table was gone-into the
deep dark sea which was roaring around
the steamer like a pack of wolves
hungry for more
treasure of the world



  to make sure that it was the truth
philip did not hesitate about ascending
to the bridge a man clad in oilskins
turned abruptly upon him

  well snarled a strange voice
what dy want here

    pardon me said philip  but there
is a rumor about the ship that the cap-
tain has fallen overboard if it is not
true you had better quiet the anxiety-
what business is it of yours said
the man in oilskins  im captain of
this ship and you get down the compan-
ion as fast as you came up 

  the man advanced upon philip men-
acingly the treasure-hunter fell back
a step astonished at the reception fur
a moment his blood boiled then it
chilled as he caught the odor of the
mans person the first mate-for it
was he - had been drinking philip
walked down the ladder

  he went below to the dining-saloon
where he came upon a group of scared
passengers miss harding saw philip
and stopped him with a question

    is it true mr sand they say the
captain has fallen overboard

    it may be true or it may not said
philip slowly and he forced a smile
 but one thing  do know i have just
been on the bridge talking with the cap-
tain and he is in no very civil frame of
mind

  there wheezed the jamaica
planter gossip all gossip i
never was on a ship that didnt gossip

   philip said no more he let the mis-
understanding act as he had intended it
should and retired to his cabin he
read a novel for an hour while the wind
screamed around the ship and the steel
plates hummed with the vibration of the
driving sea just as he was retiring a
steward entered to ask if anything was
wanted philip inquired as to the
weather

    dont like it sir said the man
lie cautiously closed the door and whis-
pered mysteriously its true sir
captains overboard and chief otfcer
howells drunk as a fiddler we should
have castle light by now and theres
not a sign of it dont like it sir

   neither do i said philip
  nevertheless he had had enough of

to be c

participation in the ships affairs for
himself nothing mattered much his
life was mortgaged anyway and tlu-re
were worse things than drowning miss
harding came to his thoughts but he
put out the light and presently was
lulled to sleep by the ocean and the wind

  it seemed a moment later that he was
awakened by a terrific shock the cabin
was in darkness there was a pattering
of feet on deck a mingled chorus of
shouts curses and screams

  a moment later there was a hammer-
ing on the door of his cabin and a
womans voice crying

  mr sand mr sand

   thank you miss harding said
philip  i am coming go on deck

i	shall join you and miss sharpe there
dont be alarmed

  then philip sand switched on the
light the cabin seemed all askew ap-
parently the revuelan had climbed up
on a reef or on an island-sliore any-
how she seemed hard and fast so philip
proceeded to dress with little less than
his customary coolness to a man
whose life is mortgaged nothing mat-
ters a great deal as long as it is inter-
esting and to a person of philips turn
of mind being shipwrecked on a desert
island was quite interesting

  he had just about finished dressing
when the ship gave a queer jerky shiver
next moment it seemed as if the floor
was sliding from under his feet in-
stantly he realized what was happening
the steamer was sliding back

  he darted through the cabin - door
across the saloon and bounded up the
companion as he rushed deckward he
was conscious of a sullen sinking of the
vessel beneath his feet the uproar of
the sea and of human voices suddenly
became terrific as he emerged on deck
he was greeted by the sight of a wall of
water steadily climbing over the rail

  the revuelan was going to the bot-
tom he glanced swiftly along the
deck dozens of men were crowding
around the boats me discerned the fig-
ure of only one woman he dashed
toward her in the darkness but a great
wave of water slid between him and the
figure and next moment he was battling
with the ponderous black sea
ntinued
fighting the tickec-scalpers

by h a ko ach

assistant chairman railway ticket protective bureau

we begin here one of the most important and interesting series that ever
appeared in the railroad mans magazine it doesnt seem
possible that there are people on this continent so gullible as those
mentioned by mr koach-people who would sell what they had left of a
railway ticket for twenty-five cents because the scalper said llis price was
three dollars a yard think of it

    ticket-scalping grew to be an organized protected industry before the
railroad lines which had inst thousands of dollars took a hand in the matter
the railway ticket protective bureau is an organization similar to the
american bankers association and the jewelers alliance with pinkerton
connections

the many ingenious schemes used to lure the cash of the unsus-
pecting traveler by a band of men who cleverly
manage to evade the law

first article

  at that time a scalper or as he pre-
ferred to be called a railroad-ticket bro-
ker who dealt in altered tickets soon
became an object of suspicion to his
brother ticket - scalpers who not only
would refuse to do business with him
but frequently informed the railroad
companies of his fraudulent practises

  this course was pursued by them not
from any line sense of honor but be-
cause they were at the time in receipt
of many favors from the railroads

easy to be a scalper

  the wholesale forgery of printing
tickets outright and by means of acids
changing the destination on regular tick-
ets purchased from railroad offices had
not yet reached the point where it ma-
terially threatened the passenger revenues
of the railroad companies which it at-
tained in later years



enormous quantities of

forged and altered rail-
road tickets were discov-
ered at the close of the
worlds fair in 

             prior to that time there
had been occasional instances where al-
tered tickets were found by railway
auditors when checking-up but these al-
terations were confined wholly to what
is known as  plugging   that is filling
up the canceled date of an expired ticket
with papcr-pulp of the same color as
that of the ticket and cutting a later
date in month or year on the ticket with
an  i  punch thereby reviving its life

  this however was so poorly done that
the plugging was frequently discovered
by a conductor when the ticket was of-
fered for passage frequently mr scalp-
er got a sound thrashing from the irate
passenger at the office where the ticket
was purchased
fighting the ticket - scalpers	

  during the summer of  the eastern
lines made unusually low rates from
new york boston and other eastern
points to chicago what is known as
a  coach-ticket  was then first intro-
duced this was practically a second-
class ticket sleeping-car accommoda-
tions were not allowed in connection
with it it was limited to ten days for
a round trip was non-signature good
for use of any one and accordingly
transferable having the date of its ex-
piration printed on its face

  these tickets were sold by eastern
lines one day each week only and to
avoid confusion each weekly issue was
of a different color they were printed
on ordinary paper and were not en-
graved plain type such as is found at
any printing-office was used excepting
of course the signature of the general
passenger agent which was an engraved
facsimile

  the ease with which these tickets could
be bought and sold the slight knowledge
required as to rates and train-schedules

induced many to embark in the scalping
business

  but small capital was required to open
an office some gaily colored cardboard
signs six feet of space in any store a
large stock of impudent self-assertion
and a hypocritical pose as a friend of
the people by procuring cheaper rates
than they could secure for themselves
together with the assumption that al-
most anything that had the semblance of
a railway-ticket would pass the scrutiny
of those whose duty it was to pass upon
it-these constituted the scalpers stock-
in-trade

  many of these new recruits obtained
their primary knowledge of the scalping
business and its possibilities for fraud
while being employed as train  skin-
ners  by ticket-brokers they had to
procure portions of tickets by boarding
the incoming excursion-trains or remain
about the railway - stations and induce
passengers to sell their unused transpor-
tation

  large numbers of the return portions


the railroad mans magazine

 f these tickets found their way into
 scalpers hands as the rate from new
 york for the round trip was but ten dol-
 lars many travelers availed themselves
 of it the chicago scalpers would pay
 from five to eight dollars for the return
 portion of such tickets and in this way
 the passenger from new york had an
 exceedingly cheap one-way trip

auditing departments helpless

    notwithstanding that hundreds of re-
 turn tickets were daily secured by scalp-
 ers the supply was not equal to the
 demand it was then that the parasites
 realizing the ease with which the tickets
 could be counterfeited had large quan-
 tities printed which were sold without
 difficulty or detection

    owing to the heavy travel the audi-
 ting departments of the railroads were
 swamped with work and could not check
 up promptly so the frauds were not dis-
 covered until the exposition was over
 when this wholesale forgery was de-
 tected the itinerant scalpers some forty
 of whom had opened temporary offices
 in chicago closed their shops and moved
 to pastures new so  arrests or prose-
 cutions could be made the railroads
 simply swallowing their losses with the
 lessons learned

   to show with what ease the unsus-
 pecting and unsophisticated stranger vis-
 iting chicago could be imposed on the
 following authentic episodes are cited

the iron-bound box trick

    a traveler having returned portion
 of a ticket for sale would call on a cer-
 tain scalper who would simply look the
 ticket over and without saying a word
 or asking what price was desired for it
 would drop it through a small opening
 into a large iron-bound box with a mas-
 sive padlock which stood at one end of
 the counter

   he would then open his cash-drawer
 and give the party offering the ticket
 twenty-five cents of course an im-
 mediate protest would be made by the
 stranger who probably had expected to
  get at least one-half of the original cast
 of the ticket the scalper would appear
 very much surprised and explain that

the rule of the railroad-ticket brokers
association was to pay a fixed rate of
one dollar a yard for tickets and as this
ticket was only a quarter of a yard long
he had offered him the regular price-
a quarter of a dollar

  another lengthy argument would en-
sue when the scalper would apologize
for placing the ticket in the box stating
that he was simply a clerk in the estab-
lishment and had ro key but if the
stranger desired to await the return of
the proprietor the ticket would be given
back to him

  of course the proprietor would never
return and the stranger tired out with
long waiting would depart with his
piece of silver

worked with bunco men

  then there was the nifty scalper in
collusion with  bunco steerers whom
they notified by a system of signals pro-
vided the victim had sufficient money on
his person to make it worth their while
to rob him

  for instance a party desiring to go
to some point in california would shop
for rates among the different scalpers
who would closely question him as to
how many there were in his party when
they intended to go and if lie expected
to purchase his tickets that day

  if it was found that lie had the means
to purchase four or five tickets to cali-
fornia lie would be asked to return in
an hour when the scalper promised the
tickets would be ready for him in the
meantime the bunco steerer would be
communicated with and given the neces-
sary information as to point of destina-
tion desired and when the stranger re-
turned he would be told that the scalper
had been unable to secure the required
tickets

the old old story

  after leaving the scalpers shop he
would be accosted by a well-dressed man

-	the accomplice of the scalper-who
would make inquiries as to where he
could dispose of two or three tickets
to say stockton california which of
course would be the exact point where
the stranger wished to go
fighting the ticket - scalpers



a

  the stranger would he induced to ac-
company the supposed owner of the tick-
ets to his hotel to complete the trans-
action and cn route his new-found
acquaintance would invite him into a
saloon where with the aid of confeder-
ates the stranger would be inveigled
into some game whereby he would be
promptly and scientifically fleeced the
scalper getting his commission on the
proceeds

  again a ticket would be called for
to some town in montana the scalper
would possibly have one reading to some
iowa point he would then cut a rail-
road map so as to eliminate a number
of the states and paste it together again
in such a manner as to bring the mon-
tana point within a quarter of an inch
of the town in iowa indicated by the
tickets

  then he would convince the unsophis-
ticated stranger that by purchasing this
particular ticket and paying a small cash
fare of a dollar or so to the conductor
he would reach his destination for a very

low rate the guileless passenger when
he arrived at the city designated in his
ticket would find himself nowhere near
his destination and obliged to pay a con-
siderable sum to reach it

put aboard the elevator

  it is said that many country visitors
after paying the prices demanded for
railroad-tickets would be taken to the
elevated trains put aboard by one of
the dnnumerable runners employed by
the scalpers and told that their tickets
had been given to the conductor and that
they would have no further trouble re-
garding them

  on arriving at the terminus of the
elevated line they would find that they
were still in chicago when complaint
was made to the police department they
were unable to identify the scalper with
whom they had transacted their business
the streets were honeycombed with scal-
pers offices all presenting a similar ap-
pearance

bene vole nt-loo king elderly man
and his daughter showed two
return tickets reading
from chicago to port-
land


the railroad mans magazine

  to further confuse their patrons when
a worthless ticket was sold a scalper
would fully explain that he was thor-
oughly responsible a member of the scal-
pers association in good standing and
that he guaranteed all his transactions
he would then hand the purchaser his
business-card saying that if there should

mexican canadian and even confed-
erate money in exchange for their tickets

  they would ask their victim if he in-
tended going to any other point after
visiting the exposition if so they would
make a trade with him giving him an
order on a scalper for a ticket to a point
where he wished to go taking the return

he would drop it through a small opening into a large iron-bound box

with a massive padlock

be any question as to the acceptance of
the transportation on the part of the
railroad officials to return at once and
the money would be refunded

  this generally inspired confidence in
the victim the ticket of course was
refused on returning to the address
given on the alleged business-card of the
scalper he would find that it did not
exist or that it was the address of some
other scalper who of course denied all
knowledge of the transaction

all kinds of money given

  the men employed by the scalpers to
purchase tickets on trains worked in-
numerable schemes to swindle passen-
gers even going so far as to give them

portion of his ticket in exchange for this
order this exchange order when	pre-
sented to the scalper on whom it	was
drawn would not be recognized or
more frequently no such concern	ex-
isted as that on which the order	was
given

the busy  mr t pump

  the issuance of  rebates  was an-
other method employed in swindling the
unsuspecting public a scalpers  re-
bate  was an order from one scalper to
another for the payment of certain
money on delivery of certain portions
of unused railroad transportation read-
ing beyond the destination to which it
hail been used
fighting the ticket - scalpers



  innumerable would be the  rebates 
made out during the worlds fair to
 mr t pump located in different
towns throughout the country to a
man wanting a ticket to st paul a
scalper would sell one reading a short
distance beyond that point charging for
the entire distance but declaring that
on presentation of the unused portion
of the ticket to the scalper on whom the
 rebate  order was drawn he would be
refunded a certain sum

  he would -then give the purchaser a
 rebate  order on  mr t pump
located on  water street st paul
the victim on his arrival in st paul
would find no such scalper and would
soon realize that he had been fleeced ard
that he was in possession of the unused
portion of a ticket worth perhaps sev-
enty-five cents or a dollar which was of
no service to him and for which he had
paid the scalper four or five dollars

selling an office

  another source of revenue was the
selling of half-interests in scalpers of-
fices by advertising in the daily papers
a scalper would sell a half-interest in
his business to some one seeking an in-
vestment which was profitable and did
rot entail any particularly hard work

  immediately after the payment of the
money the scalper would leave his new
partner in charge of the business then
he would notify a number of his friends
in the same business who would rush in
and interview the new partner selling
him as many altered manipulated and
expired tickets as they could induce him
to buy making him particularly low and
attractive prices

  he would be immensely elated over
his business acumen until the return of
his partner who with a great show of
anger would demonstrate to him that he
had been wasting the money of the con-
cern by buying worthless tickets and
that he was totally unfit for the scalping
business this would usually result in
the scalper repurchasing his interest for
a small sum of course taking into con-
sideration the amount expended for
worthless tickets

   if this could not lie accomplished the
victim would be induced to buy the

entire interest and the scalper would
promptly open another office and pursue
the same tactics on some other innocent
investor

  that scalpers not only preyed upon
the public but on each other is shown
by the following

foxy grandpa

  a benevolent-looking elderly man and
his daughter entered a scalpers office
and showed two return tickets reading
from chicago to portland oregon the
old man said that he found it impossible
to return within the limit of the tickets
time and wished to sell them his story
was so plausible that he succeeded in
selling the tickets it was found later
that he went the rounds of the scalpers
offices reciting the same tale and selling
two tickets at each place visited

  shortly afterward these tickets were
shown to be forgeries and the fact that
the deal had been engineered by two
itinerant scalpers was revealed this
was apparently such an easy method of
obtaining money that they endeavored to
sell more of these forged tickets even
after suspicion had been aroused

  the same benevolent old chap entered
the office of one of the scalpers who
knew that the tickets were forgeries and
who was on the alert for them he
treated the old man most courteously
until he was able to lock the door when
he told him in plain terms it was up to
him to disgorge what railroad-tickets he
had in his possession or he would cause
his arrest

wheels within wheels

  the man finally admitted his guilt
and handed over some fifty or sixty of
these forged tickets the scalper know-
ing it would be impossible to dispose of
the tickets as the line over which they
read had been notified of the forgery
arranged the following deal

  hastily rushing to a pawnbroker he
said that a well-known railroad official
had selected him to act as agent for their
road in disposing of a large number of
tickets which he could get at a very low
rate but the transaction must takeplace
secretly


the railroad mans magazine

  unfortunately he told the pawnbroker
that he was unable to furnish the cash
capital required by the railroad official
but if the pawnbroker would furnish the
money he would leave the tickets with
him as collateral paying him for them
as they were sold and in addition al-
low him a handsome commission

  the pawnbroker promptly advanced
one thousand dollars and took the tick-
ets as security the tickets were never
redeemed

  a passenger had bought a ticket read-
ing to new york he was assured that
it was a first-class ticket but on present-
ing it to secure sleeping-car reservations
lie ran against a snag the pullman
agent called his attention to a clause
printed on the ticket which stated that
it would not be accepted for passage in
sleeping-cars

cut it in two

  the passenger angrily returned to the
scalpers office showing him the clause
in the ticket and demanding the return
of his money the scalper said he could
easily remedy this taking the ticket to
a rear room he eliminated this clause by
cutting it out bodily and pasting the
ticket together he returned it to the
passenger asking him to again apply to
the ticket-office for sleeping-car accom-
modations this time the ticket evidently
passed muster

  at the close of the exposition the scalp-
ers became so bold that they did not even
take the trouble to furnish tickets to
their victims they would guarantee to
deliver certain tickets at a given date
giving themselves a week or ten days
time demanding and securing from fifty
to seventy-five per cent of the price asked
for the ticket

those in the game

  hundreds of deposits were taken but
the night before the delivery was to be
made the miscreants disappeared taking
with them the money of their gudgeons

  it was from this class that the
skilled ticket manipulator and forger was
evolved also the experts in acids the
colorists who by the aid of dyes are
able to give to a ticket its original color
after it has been removed by its acid
bath the maker of forged validation
stamps the printer of forged tickets and
passes  railways which existed only 
his imagination the corrupter of rail-
way employees and the ticket  fixer
who claims that he is willing to permit
any railroad official to take a new un-
used ticket from the ticket case place on
it any writing any stamps or date or cut
out any limit with a ticket punch or in
fact make out the ticket in any way he
wishes and that he will restore it in one
hours time to its original condition

  such men never frequented scalpers
offices but maintained rooms in close
proximity where with their complete par-
aphernalia they worked skilfully and se-
cretly for the different scalpers altering
and forging tickets

  the type of ticket-scalpers of whom i
have written became a distinct class by
themselves they maintained offices in
different cities throughout the country
bound together by the strongest ties of
belf-protection assessing themselves to
maintain a defense-fund for use in event
of arrest and prosecution gradually ab-
sorbing the entire scalping business

  they even had their own language
never speaking of a railroad ticket in its
proper terms all tickets were  duck-
ets  or  broads  a passenger was a
 rummey   a small contrivance used by
them for redating a ticket was named a
 dinkey and the redated ticket was
spoken of as  redinked while a ticket
requiring alteration had to be hit a
forged stamp was termed a  phoney

  they finally became such a menace to
the passenger revenues of the railroad
lines that the railway ticket protective
bureau an organization comprising all
of the railway lines in the united states
canada and mexico was formed for the
purpose of bringing these malefactors bo
justice

    this is the first of a series of three articles in the second mr koach will describe
the method of forging tickets the arrangement of scalpers offices fake scalpers the corruption
of railway employes by scalpers the forging of validating stamps on railway tickets the
making of one ticket out of two and the raiding of some noted scalpers offices
the fraser-flaxman fight

by frank condon

         how you can occasionally win on a horse
         that doesnt finish within a mile of the post

ne thing on the face of the
  earth that defies logic and
  sneers at reason is the firm
  belief of a street-car con-
  ductor that he is as good
  as a railroad fireman

  there was the case of peter flax-
man the other man was david fraser
and the girl was nora feely by which
admission is established immediately the
three sides of the
human triangle and
while all such geo-
metric figures promise
and produce action
of one sort or an-
other this particular
triangle began to bat
over  from the
very first

thriving western me-

like every pther owl

  miss feely was twenty years old the
night of the car-barn
fire that was the
biggest event in to-
ledos history and it
was very exciting
you will have no
trouble in placing
the date so you can
see that miss feely
is still quite a young
woman and she is
every bit as entran-
cing this minute as
she was that night

  she watched the
flames from the top
of peter flaxmans
car which had been
converted into a
seeing toledo
burn  vehicle in
special honor of the
occasion

  during that terri-
ble visitation of the
fire fiend young mr
fraser stoked an-
thracite into a pony
engine in the yards
-a snorting hustling
little four - wheel
brooks with the
disposition of a mis-


the railroad mans magazine

scmri mule and an abrupt habit of throw-
ing a man off liis feet every time the
brakes were applied mr fraser had
reason to believe miss feely was watch-
ing the fire furthermore lie was con-
vinced that mr flaxman was some-
where near her and the double thought
peeved him in a most acid way

   i dont wish him any bad luck
communed mr fraser passing in the
coal  but i hope lies under the next
wall that falls she makes me tired
anyhow chasin around with a bell-
ringin nickel-chasing shrimp that cant
keep his ears clean she ought to have
better sense

  whereupon pony no ill bucked vio-
lently into a pullman and tried to push
the water-gage down mr frasers throat

  one day six months before the fire
davy fraser finished washing his face
in the roundhouse preparatory to buy-
ing some chewing-gum in the waiting-
room davy hadnt chewed gum in
fourteen years but there was a new girl
behind the counter and she looked like
a dream come true davy had seen her
for the first time in the morning and
his long-lost love for gum abruptly re-
turned

  at the gum counter and partly hiding
it was a man in a blue uniform when
davy strolled in through the clicking
telegraph office the man in the uniform
was buying gum and indulging in what
appealed to davy as some very loose and
infantile conversation about the color of
eyes and how brown eyes always looked
nicer than blue eyes

  miss feely had brown eyes-very
brown eyes the sort of brown eyes that
make their owners telephone number
stand out in a mans memory like a light-
house davy had always hated peter
flaxman but until he saw peter talk-
ing to miss feely that bright afternoon
he never realized how intense a loathing
one man may have for another

  there he was a blue peter in good
sooth blue uniform blue cap nickel
buttons badge gloves and all and talk-
ing to miss feely for all the world like
a silly magpie when no doubt she was
interminably bored and irritated

   have you got any blood red
gum miss asked davy politely
 hallo

  lie addressed the last word to mr
flaxman coldly and frigidly

   hallo davy answered peter
brightly   havent seen you since that
night you came near being arrested
how you ever got out of that scrape
beats me

  miss feely looked politely interested
 i havent any blood red she said
in the pause that followed peters pleas-
ant remark   but we sell tulips heart
its very good gum would you like
some tulips heart

   thats the very name  was trying
to think of i always chew that kind
gimme fifty cents worth

  davy peeled off the tinfoil and in-
serted a wedge in his mouth

   aint you chewing tobacco no
more asked mr flaxman with in-
terest

   i never did chew tobacco respond-
ed davy tartly  your motormans
calling you

  it was even so peter smiled bright-
ly at miss feely who had seemingly
been paying slight attention

   so long miss feely he said  ill
see you the next trip

  do you know flaxman asked
davy when the conductor had gone

   not very well me comes in to see
me when his car gets here hes a nice
man i think hes very fond of gum
are you  

   i live on gum replied davy
 what was he saying to you about
brown eyes when i come up  

  oh nothing me was just talking
like all you men talk arent you the
fireman out in the yards

    fire the switch-engine admitted
davy i get a job runnin before
long do you like street-car conduc-
tors 

  miss feely smiled one of those quick
smiles that start and end in the same
second

   i dont know she answered  i
like men if i like them regardless of
what they do for a living do you like
girls who work in railroad-station wait-
ing-rooms selling gum to firemen who
chew tobacco

  she leaned her rounded elbows upon
the glass case and looked davy in the
eye he grinned
the fraser-flaxman figh t

   sure i do but now listen i aint
got a tiling against street-car conduc-
tors theyre generally dead - beats or
crooks of some sort or other and they
usually drink like a fish anil never pay
their debts and they never have a decent
home over their heads and theyre not
refined ami theyd probably steal the
pennies off a dead mans eyes but out-
side of that theyre all right taking
them as a class theyre all right outside
of the trifling exceptions  mentioned

cover a capable switch-engine shinnying
around the yards and during most of
the day youll see me chucking coal into
her

   every now and then im coming in
to buy some of this here tulip gum and
eventually i believe well get to know
each other and in the course of time
im going to ask you definitely to come
to a dance with me because if there ever
was a swell little dancer in toledo the
same is yours etc etc

im going to ask you to marry me to-night

how long since you knew this flaxman
fellow 

   i began this job at seven-thirty this
morning laughed miss feely  i met
mr flaxman at seven thirty-two and
hes been in to see me at the end of
every trip so far his car has to wait
outside for ten minutes each time

  do you ever go to dances asked
davy changing the subject easily

   very often i love to dance

  if you ever get to know me better
dye suppose i might have the honor
 well see later on

   well if you look out through that
last window once in a while youll dis-

  a customer interrupted the flow of
conversation and davy walked forth
into the summer-nights air smiling upon
the rich and the poor alike

  miss feely was the sole support of a
large and expensive wardrobe and in-
cidentally she won the bread for a timid
little mother there was nothing bril-
liant about her except her eyes and
nothing pretty except-well her whole
sweet self in toledo a girl must work
for a living or get married no to-
ledo girl has ever tried out the first
system to its fullest extent and mar-
riage is as common as conversation

  miss feely had no particular aspira-


the railroad mans magazine

tions ideals or ambitions but she liked
good-looking men who were properly in-
troduced and occasionally she became
acquainted with other men in unconven-
tional ways-just as she came to know
davy fraser and peter flaxman

  peter was a good-looking chap so
was davy peter made a fair income
and so did davy peter had a gift of
gab and a sweet way of talking nonsense
to a girl and davy lost points on this
count but the triangle started out
easily and made good time from the be-
ginning

  it was peter who first leaped the
bounds of restraint and carried off the
girl to an ice-cream social in walbridge
park it was peter who drove himself
into a book-store and bought a bundle of
books the contents of which were pure

greek to him they had nice covers
and they made an acceptable gift it
was peter who learned to buy flowers
now and then to mind the holidays with
an appropriate greeting to tip his hat
frequently and whatever he did davy
came in behind with a mild sort of imi-
tation

  davy was no ladies man but he was
a mighty good fireman he could tell
the steam-pressure without looking at the
gage but he couldnt make a pretty
speech to save his soul as a social
light he was unlit

   now and then after all three had be-
come pals-all except davy and peter
-the fireman would invite the girl out
for a moonlight ride on the lake he
might take her to a summer-theater show
or he might drop in at the little cottage
up on western ave-
nue and idle away a
few hours without
making any particular
effort to be entertain-
ing or amusing

  one night davy sat
in the big morris
chair staring at nora
and wondering how it
would feel to be able
to ask her if she had
put out the cat and
locked the back door
he sat up suddenly
under the weight of a
stray thought and pro-
pounded 

    say nora do you
like peter flaxman
better than me

  n ora turned her
brown eyes on him in
mild surprise

   ive often won-
dered she said grave-
ly  its been both-
ering me lately more
than ever ive sat up
with that particular
thought more -than
one night peter is a
fine chap so are you
neither one of you
has made violent love
to me but im not
blind and i can see

 x never did chew tobacco responded davy tartly
 your motormans calling you
the fraser-flaxman fight



then everybody clutched with their arms wrists knees and fingers as the

passionless steeds shot down with a metallic roar

that you like me peter asked me to
marry him last night

   as usual grunted davy  hes in
ahead of me again well i may be a
trailer but im consistent so im go-
ing to ask you to marry me to-night i
dont care what you told pete but if
you said you would marry him im go-
ing to look him up this bright sum-
mers eve and knock his block off

    didnt say i would marry him i
told him he would have to wait

  that sounds better now what are
you going to tell me 

   same answer davy i cant decide
i wish i could because somebody is
going to get the worst of this and i
dont want to hurt either you or pete
i presume one of you will be hurt

   one of us will unless i marry you
nora if you have any large sums of
money around the house go and get a
bet down that one of us will be hurt
and his initials will be p f say can
you see me  the curb watching you and
him trail into church-him in a waiters
dress suit and you all dressed up

   nix ill be on the curb maybe but
ill carry a dynamite bomb and ill
touch it off right after some one gives
pete away taking great care to have it
remove him from earth no ive been
reading the cards and they say youre
going to lose the feely end of your name
and adorn yourself with the pleasing
name of fraser

  nora laughed and so did her small
mother the mother always sat in on
these little affairs and davy wasnt the
least embarrassed

 how much do you make now
asked nora im not mercenary but
its nice to know the facts in case of
fire

   hundred and thirty counting over-
time and ill do better when i start run-
ning we can get married to-morrow
and have a honeymoon next year

   next year ill answer that but
remember this im ready to marry
either you or peter i cant settle it
because i cant and thats all there is to
it things will have to go on in the
same way until something happens


the railroad mans magazine

  nothing happened to sway the situa-
tion from its perfect poise peter and
nora were fast friends and davy and
nora were fast friends true peter
escorted die girl to frequent social
events but davy trailed along about the
same- as ever so the general average was
undisturbed

  even a fireman can become jealous
davy was jealous not only that he
was angry and threatened peter with
bodily harm whereat peter laughed
and when the grand ball of the fourth
ward democratic club was given at the
casino peter slipped one over on davy
for the thousandth time by getting in his
invitation to nora first

   im awfully sorry davy nora
said consolingly  but peter heard of
the affair before you did and he asked
me to go with him so i couldnt very-
well refuse

   all right replied davy  i hope
you have a good time but remember
im sore

  he cut his visit short because he
couldnt keep up his end of the conver-
sation and noras mother remarked that
david was getting stupid

  the day and night of the grand ball
spread red ink upon the fair annals of
toledo everybody was going the
municipal offices were to be emptied
and every official from the mayor down
to the workhouse superintendent had
promised to attend even the red-
headed mayors secretary who never at-
tended anything had given his word
and when the sun came up  that fes-
tal day all the chivalry and beauty with-
in the city walls began to pile into the
wabbly street-cars at  the casino
grounds were filled and by night the
attendance was dancing around the
twelve-thousand mark

  when twelve thousand toledoans de-
cide to leave town temporarily-and the
casino is out of town-what remains of
the city is peculiarly lonely after davv
fraser had wiped the lubricating - oil
from his ruddy countenance and pol-
ished himself back to decency lie
emerged from the roundhouse and
thought solemn things

  nora was riding the merry-go-round
with pete nora was eating gummed
molasses and popcorn with pete nora

was sitting in retired corners drinking
lemonade with pete they were shoot-
ing the chutes pete and nora and
without a shadow of doubt pete had his
arm around nora to prevent her from
falling

  davy had a perfectly fine time with
his thoughts until they finally got the
better of him and like the murderer
returning to the scene of the crime
davy boarded a south street car and
started for the casino

  a street-car ride frequently clears a
mans brain and opens up channels of
thought that may otherwise remain
clogged and a ride on a south street
car in toledo is the longest thing this
side of eternity by the time the mo-
torman had turned into stickney avenue
davy fraser had ceased to sit  his
shoulder-blades like a condemned pris-
oner he had taken his hands out of
his trousers - pockets and his face was
beginning to flush with a red tint which
in davys case meant either the pres-
ence of an idea or the approach of the
measles

  it was an idea

  why communicated davy telepathi-
cally to the advertising-signs in the cor-
ner of the car should this ghastly farce
be continued longer why should he
davy who was continually and monot-
onously bested by a transfer - punching
rival submit to further mortification
hadnt the thing gone on for months
hadnt he lost on every occasion was
he any more likely to win in the future
he was not

  then why not end everything imme-
diately have it settled and over with
and if things turned out wrong let em
turn if davy had known what a die
was he would have cast it as the car
turned into lower summit avenue

  you approach the casino grounds
through a series of curves finally stop-
ping at a raised platform beyond which
is a wire netting surrounding a lot of
unhappy animals davy slid off the car
and paid ten cents to a man at the gate
who seemed to be suffering from an ex-
treme case of ennui

  in ten minutes he had joined the
merry throng in eleven minutes he had
begun to search for a tall handsome
girl and a street-car conductor
the fraser-flaxman fight

  they were leaning over
the railing watching the
hired motor-boats pete was
explaining and nora was
listening davy anchored in
the offing sheltered by an
ice-cream booth he medi-
tated upon various tilings
but uppermost in his mind
was the notion to suddenly
leap upon the inoffensive
pete and if possible kill him
with despatch and throw the
body into the water

  then seize the girl and
leave abruptly without being
discovered in the cold light
of even davys reason the
plan had weak points some
one would be sure to see
him in the thirteen thousand
thereabouts so he paused
and bought another ice-cream
soda

  nora and pete sauntered dow
long board walk followed by the
doughty dave they halted at various
booths and davy stopped also to avoid
detection at one point he approached
too closely and it was only by dodging
behind a stall that he escaped as they
turned to retrace their steps

  an indignant old lady regarded davy
with a malignant eye and he had to buy
a cane from her before she was con-
vinced that he hadnt meant to snitch
the till

  the casino has many attractions but
the black type in its advertisements al-
ways has to do with the steeplechase
this steeplechase renders the words of
man feeble and insufficient it causes
press-agents to run loosely to strange ad-
jectives it is the grand special the
prize feature of the show and alto-
gether the most exciting and indis-
pensable part of the performance	f

  four wooden horses slide down four
iron-shod rails for all the world like
race-horses and four people ride them
the horse that finishes first wins the
race and its rider ieceives a free ticket
which enables him or her to ride in the
next race without the payment of an
additional ten cents

  the starting-point is up on the sec-
ond floor wherethe beer is sold in bot-

the

he lowered her between
the single rails

ties and after a dizzy downward plunge
the racing steeds disappear in a cavern
of intense darkness emerging at the far
end of the grounds and circling around
in broad loops until the finish - line is
reached

  when ladies ride it is necessary to
cast conventionality to the winds be-
cause if a lady were to ride side-saddle
she would hit the ground on the first
turn with a surprising wallop you ride
astride - man woman or child-and
you clutch your wooden pegasus with
all the strength in your good knees

  so when davy saw nora and pete
heading for the steeplechase entrance
he just naturally followed hoping that
something would happen he sidled
along among the rest buying his ticket
mechanically standing in line and keep-

ing an eye on a certain ostrich plume in
front four horses galloped in

  it takes two couples to occupy four
horses pete led nora to the waiting
horse and helped her gallantly into the
saddle and if it must be said nora
fitted into the picture perfectly pete
hopped nimbly to his horse and the
starter yelled for two more riders a
pale-faced youth clambered upon the
horse on the inner rail leaving a vacant
horse between him and nora

  davy looked at the empty horse it
looked good he slipped out of the
line and covered ten yards in two sec-
onds

  nora was surprised you cant pay
attention to emotions on the casino
steeplechase in a flash she saw that
the rider to her left was davy fraser
peter on the off horse saw it too
then everybody clutched with their
arms wrists knees and fingers as the
passionless steeds shot down with a
metallic roar

  whether davy had figured it out
beforehand or whether the inspiration
came to him on that first downward
dip is something for historians to puzzle
over the cane he had bought under
protest was in his hand and beside him
hanging-on for dear life was nora
somewhere to starboard was the hated
pete engrossed solely in the business of
sticking to a wabbling hobby-horse

  when the four horses breast to
breast disappeared into the dungeon
part of the ride davy reached over
and laid a detaining hand on the horse
beside him-not the horse occupied by
the pale-faced youth he jimmied his
cane down between the forelegs of his
own steed until it reached the cog rail
and then using it as a lever and still
holding the tail of the horse to his right
he leaned against the cane desperately

  there was a sudden and perceptible
diminution of its speed the wooden
skate swayed and bucked so did the
horse beside him slowly they drew up
side by side davy still bent forward
upon his trusty cane the terrific mo-
mentum was being overcome on his
fiery steed peter was shooting ahead
on the other side of the track the pale-
faced youth had disappeared leaving
only a grating sound in the darkness

  as the two horses slid forward a
voice sounded

   is that you davy fraser 

  is it me youre dead right its
me you hang on tight and well be
out of this hole in a minute look at
the daylight ahead dont go and get
scared im working this-thing

  the steep lechase-eourse winds around
the south end of the casino grounds
and for a brief space it curves over the
fence that encloses the grounds at the
point where the horses cross the top of
the fence davy gave one last push at
his cane and the two racers stopped

   here said davy  weve got
twelve seconds before the next bunch
smashes into us you got to jump

  he threw his arm around the girl and
lifted her clear of the saddle then
with infinite care he lowered her be-
tween the single rails holding her by
the hands until she hung suspended
eight feet from the ground and then he
dropped her

  nora landed on the grass and crum-
pled up in a little heap the cavern
behind davy suddenly began to roar
and he knew that another team of four
horses was plunging down upon him
so without further ado he dropped his
cane and slipped down head over heels
and on the outside of the fence

  two stationary wooden horses were
plowed up into splinters and rendered
useless by the collision that followed
no one was hurt the riders who fol-
lowed managed luckily enough to stick
to their saddles below them davy
was helping nora to her feet and urging
upon her the necessity of getting away
before they were arrested for murder

   dye know whfre were going he
asked as they hurried up toward the line
of waiting cars  you dont need to
answer were going to be married
im going to marry you youre going
to marry me

  nora was making a feminine noise
that is either laughing or crying it de-
pends upon the situation

   but what about peter she asked
 oh he wins thats all he wins
the race because we didnt finish un-
less davy added as an afterthought
 unless that pale-faced guy beat him
out
observations of a country
station-agent

by j  e  smith

no - chauncy discourses on the patience and labor that goes
to make up the unrewarded lot of the
ticket-agent

found chauncy our ticket-
man in a state of gloom

  outside the sun shone bright-
ly the chickadee was chirping
to his mate and the sound of
empty-headed levity from the
passing throng was borne in on the balm
of the morning air

  chauncy was downcast he sat deep
in the office chair and telescoped far
down into his clothes until nothing but
his nose was visible

   has she said it can never be  i
asked tenderly

  chauncy emitted a discordant grunt

   maybe shell be a sister i added
consolingly  by and by she may snug
up closer sisters have that cunning
habit let her know you are the high
panjandrum of the ticket-office and that
you can get passes any time for two-as
far out as minnie-ha-ha falls

  you are on the wrong trail alto-
gether said chauncy pushing his cap
up far enough to see out from under the
rim  its contact with the accursed
populace that brings on this grouch

its the people we are supposed to serve
-the dear people-our esteemed patrons
-who take advantage of us and rub it

 in on us and leave us bobtailed when we
 are expecting the most from them

  doesnt the salary go on just the
 same   i asked

the pride of chauncy

    it does replied chauncy  but 
 have a pride in the business of the office
 -in the earnings-there is where i am
 disappointed

    does the president of the road know
 what a keen interest you take in the
 business 

    dont kid  said chauncy  any
man with red blood hates to have the
game get away from him and he feels
lots worse when some one else beats him
to it maybe you think a ticket-agent
has nothing to do but sit on a cushioned
chair with an effervescent smile and
shelf-worn stock of soft words and await
the procession of faces at the ticket-
window

    maybe you think people tumble over
one another to get to our window with
their simoleons for tickets over our line
maybe you think they actually fight for
the privilege of riding  our cars
they may do that on mohammeds cele-

and gather them in and about the time

the agent on the trail

   some people think hunting the
rhino the hippo and the wart-hog in
darkest africa is real sport but it
hasnt any thrills over bagging a pas-
senger a rival line is after

   here are sample illustrations of how
we conduct the passenger business

   exhibit a-two months ago i was
waited on by professor von plunk tell-
ing me he contemplated a journey over
prairie mountain and coast for him-
self and two daughters he wanted in-
formation about fares routes stop-overs
and side trips for thirty days  con-
structed itineraries  laid out for his
approval an even hundred combinations

  ah he exclaimed enthusiastically

 how travel broadens the mind what
an education for my daughters  i de-
scribed every train on every road in
every direction

   i enumerated every attraction of the
earth below the fascination of the waters
beyond and the charm of the heavens
above  told of the silverware in the
diners i described the kind of buttons
on the coats of the porters i wore the
back off the official guide there were
to be three tourist tickets as far west as
balboas aqueous preserves we needed
the business

metaphysical travel

   the professor occupied all my spare
time for one month in the breathing
moments he told me about himself in de-
tail i was an interested listener told
me about his daugnters - their wonder-
ful talents in music and art and marvel-
ous capacity for deep thought

   his system was surcharged with a
strange cult and he unloaded all that
observations of a country station-agent 

on me something about metempsycho-
sis or transmigration of souls the nit-
ness of the ego the astral body de-
tachable from this material frame and
which can make distant journeys and
communications

   i told him when a man had that
sort of an apparatus it was no use for
us to try to compete with him on a travel
proposition our service costs money
and we cant go up against those ethe-
real projections

   that was a flippant remark of mine
and he seemed to lose interest what
do you think he finally did

   he took his daughters on one of
those cheap one-day-limit-dollar excur-
sions down to louisville and showed
them the ohio river went on the other
road too

   what did i get for all my pains
nothing-only a few tips on the infinite
-the eternal-and the immutable

   exhibit b-you know that excur-
sion party i had worked tip for magoo-
goo lake we did not get them that
was what i was thinking about when you
came in its all oft didnt i tell you
about it  thought i did

philanthropic de witt

  about two months ago mr t de
witt laid the proposition before me
he had a sunday-school class of ten
boys it occurred to him that some time
during the summer he would take his
sunday-school class on a personally con-
ducted excursion to some lake for a few
clays outing

   he didnt care if it cost him
twenty dollars for the trip two dol-
lars per head for ten de witt was
enthusiastic over it

    it will be a happy event for the
boys they will remember it all their
lives said he

   i recommended winona i went to
great pains to get particulars and loaded
him with information twenty dollars
isnt much  but in these distressed times
we are after everything however small

   de witt came back in a few days
 therell lie twelve instead of ten said
lie  we have two new boys in our
class well figure on twelve

 i went over the train schedule again

with him thats one fine thing about
handing out information to a passenger
a long way ahead you got to tell it
over again a number of times if you
write it out on paper for him the pas-
senger at once loses the paper if you
merely recite it the passenger has for-
gotten it all or is hopelessly jumbled by
the time -he reaches the station plat-
form

    i think it will be winona said
de witt  guess i can stand two more
without breaking the bank he added
this remark with merry confidence he
was back again in a week and wearing
a troubled expression

the beginning of growth

    i wish you would see said he
 what you can do for fifteen to winona
wont the road make a cheaper rate
when theres so many  you see we
have three more new scholars  and its
going to be a little expensive im afraid
unless the railroad helps me out a little
ive promised the excursion but we
ought to have better figures on fifteen
than on ten

   now a railroad in devising rates for
parties cannot see much difference be-
tween ten and fifteen i told de witt
i was afraid we could not -get any con-
cession from the road we would try
however

   he bounded in a week later with a
haunted look  the railroad will have
to do better on that rate to get us
theres twenty of us now there were
five more new scholars sunday if
theyll make it a dollar straight ill
close up the business right away

   of course we could not give him
the fare he wanted at this stage of
the proceedings the competing line but-
ted in and made a bid for the business

competitors bait

   they sent that  con-man  mc-
carty their traveling passenger - agent
up to see de witt he offered them
ooze iake and back for one dollar

   did you ever visit that cattail
swamp-that miasmic jungle take
my word for it its only a frog-pond
i told de witt if he took those innocent
ah he exclaimed enthusiastically how travei broadens the mind

what an education for my daughters  

children out there for the mosquitoes to
pump malaria into them i would report
him to die humane society

   it is said a buzzard will scent a
carcass a hundred miles same in the
passenger business within the next
two weeks we had representatives from
every road in this country to see de
witt his head buzzed with sylvan
scenes and his pockets bulged with the
alluring literature of the rail i caught
him on the fly 

    we had ten more new scholars
sunday he said hoarsely  there will
he thirty of us i think we will go to
the capitol and back i am seeing the
m and g road about it to-day they
offer us eighty-five cents for the round
trip

bait and rebait

   i saw at once that winona was out
of the question i dropped that resort
and hit  magoogoo lake it isnt

much of a lake it has two canoes and
three sycamore-trees but it was the
closest article on any road that could be
called a resort

   in the meantime poor de witt was
chasing up and down running sidewise
and going around in circles interviewing
and being interviewed trying to connect
with something cheap for his class had
now increased to forty-two

chauncys master-stroke

   our competitors began to disagree
at the psychological moment i sprang it

  why not magoogoo lake i can
get you there and back for forty-five
cents per head de witt

   he grasped at it like a straw
theres now fifty-eight of us he ex-
plained nervously passing his hand
over his pale forehead thatll be un-
der thirty dollars id better take it
and close this thing up

 that week the local paper gave de
observations of a country station-agent

i

witt a column on first page extolling
the benevolent impulse that led him to
give an excursion to his sunday-school
class to magoogoo lake you see i
tipfed it off to the newspaper and i
read it with satisfaction it was not
exactly authorized by de witt but it
sort o committed the expedition to ma-
googoo lake and that was where i
thought i had turned a neat trick

the half-fare theory

   i had but for one little unforeseen
consequence that resulted from the news-
paper publicity  had so cunningly fos-
tered on the sunday following the
announcement there were twenty-seven
additions to the class

   thus by sheer force of numbers ma-
googoo lake went down and
out of de witts calcula-
tions he took summary
action delay meant bank-
ruptcy he loaded the class
on the street-cars and took
the whole bunch out to phil
motters park for a day

  it cost him ten cents a
head and it took two cars to
hold the class that started
on a charter membership
of ten

   what did we get out of
it not a sou these were
the things i was thinking
about when you came in

these are the wherefores of
this air of sadness

  there was a momentary
interruption a woman and
her near - grown - up daugh-
ter appeared at the ticket-
window

   i want a half-fare ticket
for my little girl to she-
mung said the woman

  where is the child
asked chauncy ducking his
head and casting his eyes
about in vain search

   why this is her 

   oh indeed   exclaimed
chauncy  shes not twen-
ty-one yet is she

   the idea  retorted the
woman with warmth  she

wont be seventeen until next february
indeed she wont

   i am sorry madam but we shall
have to charge her full fare the rule
is half fare between five and twelve

   well thats funny weve never
had to pay full fare for her before
youre mighty particular but i suppose
ill haft to pay it

  she glared at chauncy with some
hostility and she passed in a silver dol-
lar with a hesitating reluctant motion
chauncy extracted full fare

   thats something a woman never
understands he said to me if she
has never paid full fare for the child
before why should she be asked to do
so this time it isnt a question of how
old or what ought to be but shes never
had to pay it before and its all wrong

the idea retorted the woman she wont
be seventeen until next february


the railroad mans magazine

to have to pay it now thats the sort
of argument you have to meet

   there is no answer to that logic
and if followed up i see no reason why
any one should ever be charged more
than half fare because having paid it
once that is sufficient reason for the next
time and that starts one of those end-
less fliains

billed through

  the woman reappeared at the win-
dow

   i want a way-bill for the girl
said she

   a what   asked chauncy

   a way-bill i want a way-bill for
her

  oh i see replied chauncy he
took a piece of clip and addressed it to
conductor no  informing him briefly
that the bearer was miss susan blinker
and her destination was shemung

   that will put her in charge of the
conductor wont it  asked the woman

  the woman took the piece of clip and
would have thanked chauncy but the
memory of the recent full-fare outrage
was too fresh in her mind to permit any
show of gratitude

   what she wanted was a note to the
conductor explained chauncy to me
 she called it a way-bill she thought
she had to use a railroad term or we
would not understand what she wanted
that note wont do any particular good
and it wont do any harm just eases
the mind of all concerned

   whenever grandpa or grandma or
any of the youngsters or the poodle dog
is put on the train the folks remaining
want em placed directly in charge of
the conductor this is a fine arrange-
ment

   the conductor usually lets them sit
in a seat and look out of a window if
they feel disposed he permits them
to leave the train when they reach their
destination he doesnt give the close
every-minute personal attention to his
charge that those behind imagine as he
has to divert his attention to minor du-
ties now and then in going by never-
theless he is a widely trusted man

   rut while you sit idly by seeing
and hearing the mishaps that befall a

ticket-man i want to point out to you
my old friend abraham bunker who
lives one mile in the country and owns
all the land in that part of the town-
ship he now approaches the window
hear me ask him about his daughter

  how are you mr bunker said
chauncv cheerily

   only middlin 

  what can we do fot you

    wanted to get the correct time
that was all replied bunker fumbling
at a silveroid watch

   nine-twenty-seven and one-half
volunteered chauncy

   thats gittin it down purty fine
aint it 

   everythings right up to the hairs-
breadth on this road by the way mr
bunker hows your daughter i under-
stand she was dangerously ill last week

  bunker looked up in quick surprise
the sunburn of his face shaded a little
and he walked out of the station rather
briskly and without making any reply

   it doesnt seem to me i observed

 that your solicitude for the health of
mr bunkers daughter aroused much
enthusiasm in the old gentleman

   he didnt make any answer at all
did he   said chauncy with a wide
grin  i will tell you the story con-
nected with it it happened last week

some saving schemes

   maybe you do not know bunker he
is one of those nice old farmers with
more chattels than he can gt down on
the inventory made it all by saving 
everything he ever got his hands on

   before the pure-food era he sold
maple molasses which he manufactured
from hickory-bark and corn-cobs he
used to take an apple that had one
rotten side cut it in halves and stick
the good half by means of a little
wooden peg to the good half of another
apple similarly affected these charac-
teristic side-lights go with the story

   last week bunker took a car-load
of fat steers to cincinnati you know
how these things are arranged the
shipper is passed free with his live stock
to market but comes back as a passenger
at regular fare

   bunker got to cincinnati very early
observations of a country station-agent

g

in the morning found a quick market
and was sold out and ready to return
by ten oclock now our no  leaves
cincinnati at ten-forty but it only makes
two stops between there and indianapo-
lis it goes through here about fifty
miles per hour

he sought the superintendents office and
told a touching story to sympathetic
ears his daughter was dangerously
ill - might not survive the day-would
not the company let him go to her on
no 

   the superintendent gave  an

   i

lw

 c 

he caught a fleeting glimpse of the farm with two of his hired men sitting
comfortably on a fence in the friendly shade of a maple-tree

   bunker wanted to come home on
 the regular local train for this
station didnt leave until  pm that
meant he would put up twenty-five cents
for his dinner and the loss of the entire
day losing a day with three or four
hired men at home and no one to watch
em and prod em along was a mighty
serious matter on the farm

a sympathetic super

   the fool hath said many things in
his time among other observations is
one that  corporations have no souls
bunker evidently thought otherwise for

order to stop at b-- and mr bunker

marched aboard with a cunning and tri-
umphant chuckle

   the superintendent had taken his
address and a little later i got a mes-
sage from him to make inquiry and re-
port quickly by wire if mr bunkers
daughter or if any other member of the
family was seriously ill

   i got the house by phone natu-
rally my inquiry alarmed mrs bunker
and aroused her curiosity to the highest
pitch but it elicited the information
that all the bunkers big and little were
in their usual health and that nothing
out of the ordinary had happened the


the railroad mans magazine

household save that the head thereof was
in cincinnati maybe something dread-
ful had happened to him goodness
gracious

   i wired the superintendent that the
state of health among the bunkers was
the very best no one ill no calls
for help

  at greensburg where no  made
its first stop the conductor received a
message from the superintendent cancel-
ing his instructions to stop at b- and

to carry the passenger on to shelby the
next regular stop paying  attention
whatever to his protest bunker went
through here about fifty miles per hour

what bunker saw

                   

   he got one fleeting glance at our
familiar faces and he caught a glimpse
o- tlij farm with two of his hired men
sitting comfortably on a fence in the
friendly shade of a maple-tree it
threw him into a duck-fit he appealed
to the conductor but that man with a
heart of stone knew his business and
bunker unloaded at shelby

   he came sneaking home on the eve-
ning train from the west and gat out
to the house in the deepening twilight-
in the sad and solemn gloaming-just
as his dying daughter was chasing a
jersey cow into the pasture-lot for the
night

  i aros to go chauncy laid his hand
on my arm and detained me a moment
longer

   when we were speaking about rev-
enue for the company a while ago said

he  i thought of billy g-at x-

when it comes to getting all the money

the patron will stand for bill has us

all beaten

a round-trip corpse

   you know when a corpse is taken
away for burial it travels on a first-class
ticket billy is the only agent i ever
knew that succeeded in selling a round-
trip ticket for the corpse

   not long ago a gentleman of a
fnjgal turn of mind approached billys
window for a ticket for a corpse when
you ask a ticket-agent for a ticket he
will automatically come back at you with
the question one way or round trip
so billy spoke up kind o unthink-
ingly  one way or round trip 

    how much is saved on the round
trip asked the thrifty passenger

  ten per cent responded billy
twenty-five cents in this case

    give me a round trip then said
the man  twenty-five cents is as good
to me as to the railroad company i
reckon no man ever saved a cent on
a ticket purchase that did not get off
that comfortable observation

   i dont know whether they ever
straightened it out or not economy
you know sometimes has its kinks it
is probable that when the buyer of the
ticket follows the lamented aforesaid
through the pearly gates and compares
notes he may find cause for reporting
billy to st peter and billy will get his

   one more remark about round trips
when a passenger knows he wants a
round trip and beats you to it he in-
variably hands you this triple combina-
tion   give me a round-trip ticket to
hardscrabble and back both ways

mailing by the trainload

the record mail consignment made in
this country by a single individual or
firm was established some months ago by a
chicago company the same firm also held
the previous record for the largest mailing
consignment

  a year ago last march they established
the first record by mailing three million
eight hundred thousand catalogues each of
which weighed two ounces on that occa-
sion thirty tons of mail-sacks were required
to convey the two hundred and sixty-five
tons of advertising matter

  this year the firm mailed six million cata-
logues the total weight was about four
hundred and fifty tons and sixty-five tons
of mail-sacks were required in both cases
the consignment was delivered direct to the
depots without intermediate handling

  if an attempt were made to mail such a
consignment in the ordinary way through
a letter-box it would take a man working
eight hours a day including sundays and
mailing an average of three catalogues a
minute about eleven years and five months
to complete the task

yards one wearying day in an effort to keep clear of the old man only to
walk heedlessly into him when his fears had been hilled to rest by his success

true story number thirty-seven

when a man breaks a rule he may as well let the result catch
up right away because it will
get him anyway

was one summer when i
worked at bessemer ore yard
that this incident occurred
it was there i first became
acquainted with windy of
all men railroad men have a
knack of characterizing a man by a nick-
name so striking that one cannot help
acknowledging that it describes its vic-
tim to perfection

  need i quote examples they will
occur to any one with a fairly wide ac-
quaintance among railroad men there
was my old friend romeo hooker of
the third ward passenger yard

  who that ever saw poor old romeo
with that soulful expression  his face
and that enormous curved nose of his
would deny that  romeo hooker  fitly
described him many a time have i
joined with the boys in a laugh at his

expense when they were eating their
lunch in the telegraph office at the old
lake shore depot but when lie was
killed by a switch-enginc we all mourned
a friend

  or need  allude to that old stand-by
 flatwheel  murphy he limped
somewhat well if you have ever
watched a freight-car limping by on a
mat wheel you will recognize the ap-
propriateness of the nickname

  it is hardly necessary to tell you at
length why  windy  was named thus
ive forgotten his other name-in fact
i doubt that many knew it outside of
those who had to do with the time-roll
he was simply  windy and that suf-
ficed if you had ever heard him talk
you would know that no other name
could fit him as well

  but if-windy did talk too much and

too loud and too long we still liked him
in spite of it true many a time would
i gladly have punched his nose for him
when i would be sweetly sleeping in the
morning hours-for i worked  nights 
in the telegraph office at the ore yard-
sleeping on the soft side of the grain-
door that served as a desk in the pump
shanty which in turn served as an
office the switch-crew would make a
run for the hill with a string of empties
to take up to the tilden mine and
windy whose business it was to close
the switch would stick his head in at
the door and wake me from my slum-
bers with the yell

   hi kid will you shut the gate after
us and yet i always did get up and
close that switch in spite of the ob-
jurgations i sent after the retreating
switch-engine and its crew by the time
they came down from the hill again and
 rode back to town with them for
breakfast we would be the best of
friends

  now as i was about to relate to you
the book of rules had a stringent rule at
that time about drop-switches i read
the other day that a friend of commo-
dore vanderbilt once told him that cer-
tain measures which the commodore
wanted the board of directors of the
new york central to take were strictly
against the laws of the state of new
york whereupon the commodore replied
with some surprise well you dont
suppose you can run a railroad in ac-
cordance with law  

  i am afraid that a few railroad men
take about the same position with regard
to the book of rules at all events
windy did not view the rule about drop-
switches with unfailing respect

  one day when he was up on the hill
with the switch-engine he did as he had
often done before there were some
ore jimmies to be placed at the rand
stock-pile

   well cut em off and you go down
there with em windy said big red
anderson the foreman in charge of the
crew can you hold em

 sure mike says windy and
climbed on the string of empties just
then he saw a polish laborer one of the
stock - pile trimmers come along the
track why should he walk back to the

engine after making the switch when
the  dago  could just as well hold
those cars

   hi polski he yelled at the trim-
mer  you go along with these jims and
stop em and climbed down off the
cars as the engine started them

   me go long the trimmer volun-
teered and started for the moving cars

  but alas just then he tripped and
fell and before he had picked himself
up and collected his wits the cars were
too far for him to catch them while
windy depending on the foreigner had
gone back with the engine well there
was about the prettiest pile-up at the
end of that track you ever saw for it
was a heavy down-grade and the way
those cars piled over the end - post
would have gladdened your heart to see

  what availed it that anderson ex-
pressed his opinion of windy to that
unlucky individual in the choicest terms
at his command and that windy in
turn poured out the vials of his wrath
on the unfortunate polack the dam-
age was done

   say the old man wont do a thing
to you when he hears of it prophesied
red to the downcast windy you
might as well ask for your c g to-day
as to-morrow and well he might pre-
dict trouble for taylor the trainmaster
whom red euphoniously designated as
the  old man had a reputation of be-
ing as quick-fire is a hair-trigger ex-
cuses didnt as a rule go very far with

  the very next day he would no
doubt be out to see the ore yard and
then windy could see his career in that
yard terminated pretty suddenly indeed
for once windy did not have much to
say the rest of the day that pile of ore-
jimmies weighed on his otherwise joyous
heart and made him more quiet than
usual

  nor did it cheer him up very much
that the others painted the old mans
temper to him in the blackest colors
at the supper-table he looked so glum
that pretty annie oneil who waited
on the table noticed it and solicitously
inquired

   whats the matter windy has
she gone back on you 

  windy forced a smile and said
 naw i just aint feeling quite meself
windy dodges the boss



  but when shorty mc-
cann and jimmy hol-
verson the engineer be-
gan to enlighten annie
as to the days mishap
duly embroidered and
enlarged windy pushed
hack his chair and
with a few random re-
marks about  grinning
monkeys left the table
followed to the door by
the s n i c k e r s of the
crowd and when that
evening m ike flaher-
ty who had just come
in on the way - freight
casually asked windy

 hows that windy

i hear you broke in a polack to-
day for your understudy there was
a free tight before andy the barkeeper
of the miners paradise separated them
with the ice-pick in short windy re-
tired in no very charitable uor joyous
frame of mind that evening

  the next morning windy stopped at
the depot office to hear the news before
going to work and harry connors the
agent said to him winking at frank
smith the operator

   say windy frank there says that
old man taylor will be over on num-
ber seven and wants to see you

   ah gwan and leave a fellow
alone windy relumed with little of
his usual spirit and made his escape
from the office he knew that connors
was joking him but he knew too that
the trainmaster very probably would be
over on number seven and in that case
would no doubt want to see him-for no
good object either windy could feel
that in his bones

  if he could only keep out of the old
mans way until number six went back
-the trainmaster would probably go
back on that train - and in that case
might forget all about the wreck at
least cool down about it a little he
walked over to the siding on which the
 stood patiently sizzling and occa-
sionally popping off steam until the
crew should all be there

   say red he ventured to the fore-
man  i dont feel right to-day can
you let me ofe this morning

 whats the matter windy  has

she hone back on you  

  anderson sized him up rather sus-
piciously and answered with a grin
 aw pile on here you aint sick any
moren i am youre just afraid of the
old man

   the dickens i am wrathfully re-
plied windy though in his heart of
hearts he knew that red was right he
swung himself on the run-board of the
engine as the engineer slowly pulled out
for the hill track determined to brave
it out for two hours they worked on
the hill then windy looking down
into the valley far below him saw num-
ber seven pulling up at the depot and
he felt almost positive that he could dis-
tinguish the trainmasters tall form on
the platform of the station in spite of
the distance

  when he saw that tall form mount
the  another of the yard engines
and saw that engine start for the hill


the railroad mans magazine

- track windy felt that he was getting
 cold feet-surely the old man was com-
 ing up the lull to fire him on the spot
 ordinarily he would not have cared so
 much  but annies smiles had enmeshed
 his heart and the prospect of leaving
 bessemer seemed dismal indeed

  stealthily he made his way down the
track and at the end of a string of cars
watched for the  as she came along
to go down the hill again he swung him-
self on and started down with them

   hallo windy said bill smith the
engineer with a twinkle in his eye  i

   anxiously he cast about for
a way to escape the avenging
doom coming up the hill

how could he manage to
keep out of the old mans
way suddenly an inspira-
tion flashed upon him the
 had no work on the hill
just-then but probably was
only coming up to bring up
the trainmaster he would
watch his chance with them

  cautiously he slid off the run-board
of the  and watching a moment
when nobody was looking his way he
jumped behind the shaft - house near
which the engine was working no-
body missed him for a moment

  presently the  came puffing along
and stopped near his engine sure
enough they had brought up the train-
master and he at once began an earnest
conversation with red as windy
watched them around the corner of the
shaft-house red seemed to be looking
around for some one windy felt sure
that the look could only be meant for
him

it couldnt have de-
prived him of speech
more effectually

thought i heard the old
man wanted you

 he didnt say nothing to
me windy truthfully re-
jlied  i got to go down
in a hurry

so then the trainmaster
had been asking for him it was with
gloomy forebodings that windy rode
down into the valley true he had
dodged the old man but that was only
temporary relief wouldnt things be
only worse because of it

  for a minute windy entertained he-
roic resolves to go up again and beard
the lion in his den but presently he got
cold feet again for an hour he hung
around the outside of the station un-
willing to go in and face the jokes await-
ing him

  suddenly he saw his own engine com-
ing down the hill track again windy
sneaked around a box car at the end of
windy dodges the boss



the house-track and awaited her coming
he saw taylor get off and go into the
station as the engine started again
he made a rush across the tracks and got
on the rear unseen not until they were
half-way up the hill did red anderson
see him

    well ill be teetotally hornswog-
gled  he exclaimed in surprise
where you been windy the old
man looked for you all over the hill

   let him keep on looking windy
replied ungraciously  i had to go
down

  red eyed him with an amused grin
but said no more he saw well enough
what windy was trying to do

    well he said  youre all right
now  hes gone down again

   windy went to work again with rather
a doubtful air he didnt feel a bit safe
yet but anyway the evil hour had been
postponed it cheered him up a good
deal when he saw number six pull out
and he rode down to dinner feeling safe
-at least for the time being

  he even cheered up enough to pass a
few jokes with annie and after dinner
he resumed his work whistling quite
merrily suddenly he seemed to feel a
foreboding he turned his eyes toward
the road that led into the valley-and
what did he see coming up afoot but
the dreaded form of the old man

  so he hadnt gone back on number
six after all and was now coming up
to devour him in a panic windy
climbed over the tank to the farther side
of the engine and dropped off without
a moments reflection anything to get
away from the dreaded interview
windy sat for two hours at the top of
the shaft-house much less interested in
the coming and going of the skips bring-
ing up their loads of iron ore than in
the coming and going of the trainmas-
ter not until dusk was falling and he
had seen the trainmaster go down the

hill with the engine did he come down
from his airy perch and venture down
toward town also

  he did not go to supper at all fo
worse than the trainmaster did he fear
the gibes of the others of the crew who
all boarded at the same place as himself
a lunch at kellys would serve him
until after number eight had gone
and the trainmaster with her

  then windy went over to the station
intent upon finding out what the old
man might have had to say jauntily
he walked into the office and cried out
as he saw connors sitting on the counter
well did the old man-

  that was as far as he got for just
then he saw taylor himself sitting in the
agents chair with his feet on the table
and evidently just engaged in a conver-
sation with the agent both turned and
looked at windy

  had a ghost suddenly appeared to
windy it couldnt have deprived him
of the power of speech more effectually
with open mouth he stared at the train-
master whom he had fondly hoped to
have eluded and who now so unexpect-
edly turned up

  but hardly had taylor seen windy
when he jumped up and jovially accost-
ed windy

   where the deuce have you kept your-
self ive been looking for you all day
were going to put another engine on
the hill and i want you to take charge
of her

  and sure enough so it was here
the trainmaster had been trying to find
windy all day to promote him  and
windy had just as strenuously dodged
the trainmaster all day for fear of get-
ting fired as a truthful chronicler of
facts i do not even venture to imperil
my reputation by telling you how many
treats it cost windy when the boys
found out the true inwardness of his un-
successful attempt to escape promotion
full speed ahead

pass all records before the end

a bright-eyed old man boarded the

as the conductor passed through the car the
old man stopped him and asked how far
it was from st paul to seattle

   sixteen hundred and twenty miles the
official answered curtly

  the next time the conductor came along
the old man stopped him again and asked
him how far it was from seattle to st
paul

   see here my man said the conductor
pompously  its sixteen hundred and twenty
miles from st paul to seattle and its six-
teen hundred and twenty miles from seattle

a story is told of a man who was walk-

who was very hard of hearing

  a train was approaching and as it round-

high heaven

a smile broke over the deaf mans face

a railroad eating-house in southern

of being one of the worst places of its kind

nounces dinner to the incoming passengers
by ringing a huge bell

  one day the old negro was accompanied
by a sad-eyed long-eared hound who at the
first ringing of the bell lifted up his voice
in a most dismal howl

  the old darky stopped and gazed at him
for a moment and with a  hush yer
mouth   started ringing again

  again the old hound with nose in the air
sent forth a long-drawn howl

  this was too much for the bell-ringer
and turning on the hound he remarked

              by james francis dwyer

            the conductor sets his inventive genius to
            work in order to take his girl to the dance

iger  hannigan put
his red face inside the old
loft room over the barn
at the blue point termi-
nal and howled for con-
ductor hogan outside
on the track hogans motorman on a
full car helped the starter by repeating
his missing mates name in the intervals
when hannigan paused to take breath

  the motorman had eleven trips be-
tween him and  pm and as that hour
had been recorded in his mind as the
time of his arrival at the railroad mens
annual ball at mulrooneys hall he was
exceedingly annoyed besides it was
snowing hard  his feet were damp and
he had just discovered that his name was
on the  red list  on a charge of run-
ning his car over sherman avenue on
 the loop

  the men sitting around the stove in
the waiting - room looked up uncon-
cernedly as hannigan continued to yell
the name of hogan they were wait-
ing for their own run-numbers to be
called and took little interest in the daily
hunt for crews that took the road be-
fore them

  any of you fellers see him cried
the starter

   saw him in the feedery an hour
ago muttered  smiler  ferris  he
was cornerin the cruller market

  hogan hogan where are you
hogan roared hannigan and when
he paused to listen the motormans sup-
porting cry came in out of the street
and echoed round the room as if seek-
ing shelter from the storm

  suddenly  deaf  monaghan shook
himself and looked round wildly
	the railroad mans magazine

youre for suspen-
sion to-morrow
sure

wtt h atcrt--

  any one calling hogan he asked
im calling him screamed the
starter  whereis he

  monaghan kicked over his stool and
rushed across the room

   hes up here experimentin with
that invention of his he muttered as
lie reached the door of the attic  he
told me to tell him when his run-number
was called but  didnh hear it

  hannigans facial area was deep pur-
ple ill give him inventions he
yelled  ill teach him to have me
roarin his name like a court-crier 
then as hogan appeared  the lad-
der he unloosed new threats  youre
for suspension to-morrow sure  he

cried the road is all tied up jump
onto that car an if i dont kill your in-
ventin bug inside twenty-four hours my
name isnt hannigan

  he followed the conductor out into
the storm and his angry threats chased
the car when the annoyed  mote  flung
on the power and raced away up the
snow-smothered track

  whizzer welch leaned over  and
poked the stove-fire industriously after
the starter left the room and then ad-
dressing himself to the red coals he re-
marked slowly itll take more than
hannigan to root the inventin bug out
of a mans brain once it gets into it

  no one contradicted the statement
but  deaf  monaghan nodded slight-
ly monaghan was touchy on the mat-
ter of his hearing and he overdid his
attempts to convince people that he
heard by nodding his head each time a
man moved his lips the big fight be-
tween him and  patch  kelly was
brought about through this habit

   patch  stood in front of monaghan
and kept on moving his lips without ma-
king a sound and monaghan nodded his
higgsv s speed-developer



head eleven times before the grins of the
others convinced him that kelly was ma-
king a fool of him it was a costly trick
for  patch after monaghan had fin-
ished expostulating with him he was un-
able to take his car out of the barn for
three days

   an -inventor is born just like a
poet continued welch  an you might
as well try to stop a frog from hoppin
as to keep em from corralin the ideas
that come into their thought-patches

   i had a brother like that mur-
mured dan moran  he went in for
experimentin with dynamite an he got
nearer heaven than ill ever get

   whizzer  welch gave the fire an-
other vicious prod and tilted his stool
backward

   i worked with an understudy to
thomas edison once he began
 every morning he was in the line-up
at the supers office cause he wanted
to demonstrate something that he had in-
vented overnight an he kept that super
busy side-steppin the labor-savers the
super reckoned he wasnt a patent-agent
but that didnt feeze higginson he said
his inventions were all for the good of
the service an on that account the boss
had to look em over

   higgsy had nick tesla and a few
of the smaller idea-chasers tied to the
fender of his little car i tell you he
fixed up a patent grip that could lift old
ladies and fat gents up on the platforms
but the boss didnt smile on that he
reckoned there werent enough old fe-
males an tubby guys in the town to war-
rant the expenditure an he told higgsy
to turn his brain to something that was
really wanted higgsy admitted the
logic an went out to clinch with what
the boss called a long-needed want
hannigan put his head in the door and
threw a run-plate at  deaf  monaghan
to acquaint him that his turn had come
and monaghan walked away regretfully
as if welchs story of which he hadnt
heard a word interested him mightily
 whizzer  glanced at him winked at
the others and continued his yarn

   higgsy came back next day with
enough joy-creases on his face to fit out
a wedding-party he had an appyra-
tus like one of those cash-carriers in a
department-store an his idea was to fix

one at every seat an have a wire running
to the tail-end of the car so that each
passenger could send his nickel along
to the junk-snatcher an leave that per-
son to look after the drunks and ancients
getting on an off

   the super spun a cold eye on it an
higgsy came out of the office unravelin
the joy-furrows at full speed he was
pretty sick of the super he let out
round the depot that the boss wouldnt
have enough imagination to see double
if he was bringing home a load of
whisky an some one put lemon-peel
embellishments on the insult an carried
it along to his highness

   thats how higgsy got put  the
horse-cars he said he didnt mind an
he reckoned hed get some experience
of horses an he reckoned right the
horse-line circumnavigated the town an
it did little biz there was only one car
on the road an the horses that dragged
it were the biggest lot of wasters from
baffin bay to patagonia

   they didnt run to schedule but six-
teen circular trips was considered a
days work an the driver of higgsys
car didnt care how long it took him to
do it he said he took the job because
he had weak lungs an wanted fresh air
an he didnt study higgsy a little bit
when he gave his ungs three or four
hours extra in the open he took a look
at higgsy the first day the conductor
came  an lie guessed he wasnt too
strong in the lungs either but the in-
ventor didnt argue the point

   the horses were the limit theyd
never take any notice of the go-ahead
bell when they slowed up to take a pas-
senger aboard cause they had  faith
in the judgment of a conductor theyd
just turn their heads an watch till the
passenger settled himself comfortably in
his seat an then theyd move off at a
walk so that he could get used to the
motion always before tackling an in-
cline theyd stop an ask each other if all
was ready for the climb an the more
higgsy protested against the time he
wasted the more the driver let em loaf

  the inventor had a girl living a lit-
tle way from the depot an when he
sixteen trips got drawn out over so much
time that he didnt have a minute to see
her between knock - off and bedtime lie


the railroad mans magazine

got mad he started to put his inventin
bug on the matter of horse speed an
lie gave the question some healthy con-
sideration

   he promised to take his girl to a
dance on the fifth day that he was doing
the merry - go - round stunt an as he
promised to be at her place at nine
oclock he looked around for some trick
that would stop the lunger from stay-
ing on the road till midnight

   at  swing-time in the slack part
of the afternoon they had only finished
ten trips an it looked as if higgsys girl
would have to be her own escort unless
the horses were in a particularly out-of-
the-way mood the inventor doubted
their ability to change their pace without
cause so he brought down an electric
battery to the barn  an before the driver
harnessed up the mules he put the affair
under a seat and then ran a couple of
wires under the car and connected them
with the steel bars of the swingletrees

   then he just waited

   the mules started out at their usual
 dead-march  step and after they
picked up four passengers at the depot
they commenced to walk round the town
the  lunger  drawin big breaths in at
every inch of the route his doctor had
ordered him to do the record-breakin
breathin act on every opportunity  an
the mules seemed to understand that he
couldnt do that while they were gal-
lopin

   half-way down the little hill from
the depot one of em stopped to bite a
thistle that was growin near the track
an just then higgsy turned on the cur-
rent on account of it being a down-
grade both of the mules were backin
against the swingletrees it was their
first introduction to electricity they
were pretty amazed

   they looked at each other as if they
thought it a trick of the  lunger but he
was breathin big so they guessed it
wasnt higgsy saw their surprised look
an he turned it on alittle stronger
they thought they had run against a
nest of hornets or rattlers the white
mule that was chewin the thistle dropped
it out of his mouth an lit out for the
horizon at a gallop an the other fellow
joined in

   the driver got the astonishment- ug

in a bad form he started out to spread
some peaceful language over them but
they were leanin on the bit in great
style the brake hadnt been used for
twelve months an it wouldnt act an
higgsy just stood on the tail-end an
made calculations on the speed they were
travelin at the mules had come to
the conclusion that somebody ridin with
the  lunger  had tried to light a fire on
their flanks an they didnt want to give
him another opportunity

   after a time some of the passengers
wanted to get out an higgsy gave the
driver a bell to stop the  lunger just
give him a sickly grin an nodded to the
mules higgsy gave him three bells
then he went -out on the front platform
to expostulate

    they wont stop said the driver
 theyre not boltin but theyve made up
their minds they wont stop

     ill have to report you said higgsy
 three ladies wish to get off an you
wont stop

    i cant  yelled the  lunger  an
while he was arguin the mules were doin
the marathon of their lives

   higgsy started to note down the
time an place an then he went inside
to quiet the three old women the men
had dropped off while he was talkin with
the driver but the lady passengers were
makin affirmations that theyd sue the
company for false imprisonment if the
guy in front didnt get his team in hand

   the driver just took no notice of the
umbrellas and hands that waved to him
from the sidewalk the mules took no
notice an every passenger they left be-
hind higgsy made a note of an warned
the driver occasionally how strict the
company was about runnin away from
fares

  a copper man got on when they were
half-way round an the driver got him
to lend a hand on the reins the cop
was pretty strong an he steadied the
mules down but -the moment he got off
higgsy turned on the current as they
were going down another hill near the
depot an the car didnt stop to report to
the starter on that trip

   it just tore by tilt depot like a run-
away trolley an when the super saw it
knockin up the pace he nearly took a
fit from astonishment that team of
higgsys speed-developer



cattle had no eye for thistles on that run
an they didnt pick up a passenger on
the route

    when they reached the depot on the
next time round the starter an the super
rushed the horses as they were trottin
by an higgsy put in his report against
the  lunger it was higgsys innings
just then an he thought of all the hours
that had been wasted through that feller
doin his big breatliin stunt in workin
hours he showed how the company
had lost two dollars
an thirty cents be-
cause the lunger
wasnt able to stop the
bus an the boss swore
hed pull it off his pay-
check

   they changed
horses then an an-
other team that had
never met electricity
came out to take the
place of the white mule
an his mate who were
still doin a hard think
try in to find out what
had bit them the new
team started off on the
old two-mile-an-hour
pace

    j ust as they were
going down the hill
one of em sights the
thistle that the white
mule had dropped
when the current bit
him this nag pulled
up to get it an higgsy
gave him a shock that
made him forget all thethistles in the
united states

    that team circumnavigated the town
in seventeen minutes an that was the
record they thundered past the depot
at a gait that would make lou dillon
look pretty sick an higgsy pretended to
weep when he saw the super gapin after
them

    he had the super on toast that eve-
nin every now and then hed ring the
bell sarcastic like an occasionally hed
go out an ask the driver if he wouldnt
pull up for a minute an the lunger
got that mad he promised to punch
higgsy silly the moment he got the mules

to stop the super swung aboard at
the depot an when he heard the drivers
tale he took the reins from him an
started to steer the team himself he
pulled them up long enough to let a big
german an his wife get aboard an
then higgsy gave them another shock
an the merry-go-round act started again

  the german was going to a party
an when the car rushed by the place he
wanted to stop at he began to make in-
quiries

    higgsy said it was the fault of the
driver he reckoned that he was quite
willing to pull up if the driver would
an the german went out to argue the
point with the boss the super told him
to mind his own business an the german
did he brought the boss a crack over
the head with his umbrella an the
 lunger  had to take the reins again
while the two were settlin the matter on
the floor of the car the germans wife
gave her husband a helping hand an the
super got a pretty bad mauling before
higgsy an a cop could separate them
higgsy was havin the time of his life
an when he saw the boss an the german

w-r hvrcm-

the germans wife gave her husband a helping hand


the railroad mans magazine

going off to the police station he nearly
wept

   the  lunger  got off the car when
they switched it into the barn to arrest
the german an the super an he reck-
oned he had enough of jigger-steerin to
last him for a week so the starter took a
hand he told higgsy confidentially
that he was the best horseman in his dis-
trict when he was a youngster an he
nearly believed he was tellin the truth
when he saw the way in which the new
team acted

   then the inventor upset his pride
he gave the mokes a little dose of the
fluid just to stop the starters tongue an
they tore around the township at a two-
eleven gait they hit a hand-cart and
knocked it into little pieces an three
mounted policemen and a fire-engine
were chasin them full speed when they
were doin the second time round the
bailiwick

  lliggsy didnt want to go round for
another trip so he took the wires out an
wrapped up the battery in a sheet of
newspaper when they pulled up at
the depot he stepped off an made out
his run-card an a few accident reports
about the breakin up of the hand-cart
an a collision with an ice-wagon an
then he found he had two full hours to

get into his glad rags an travel to the
ladys home

   but those six mules didnt forget
that electric current for a while not
one of em would stop to pick up a
thistle or a bit of green grass for months
afterward an the lunger had to give
up the deep-breathin stunt cause they
traveled too fast

   how did the superintendent get
on asked moran

   oh him cried  whizzer    he
got fined ten dollars for assaultin the
fat german an higgsy celebrated so
strong that he got fired but he-

  the red face of hannigan came in
the door with a jerk

  whats up with you welch he
screamed angrily  ive been calling
you for the last ten minutes

  welch picked up a coat and hurried
out into the night and the group around
the stove relapsed into silence pres-
ently dan moran stood up and felt
around for his top coat

   holy moses he cried  me coat
is gone that lyin feller whisked it
away while i was thinkin of the lec-
tricity man an the horse-car but if i
catch him between this an tuckapanna
ill give him a bigger shock than the
horses got

george a sheldon depot master
of the lake shore station at adrian
michigan who died recently after forty-six
years of continuous service with the lake
shore company was a veritable encyclo-
pedia of railroad incidents his narrations
were confined to actualities ihus giving
them a real value says the detroit news
he was for many years a conductor and
among the best of the incidents he related
the following

   one day there stepped aboard my train
a well-dressed business-appearing man who
as he tendered his fare remarked

    i see you are still on the road mr
sheldon

    yes  am still at it i replied  but

	am not certain that i remember you
though  think i have seen you

    yes you have seen me before em-
phasized the passenger  and while you
doubtless have forgotten it  still remember
that you once did me the greatest favor of

my life come to my seat when you get
time and i will tell you about it

   when i had finished collecting fares i
dropped into the strangers seat and he con-
tinued  years ago f was four days brake-
man on your train at -the end of the four
days you took me aside and remarked in a
tone of sympathy  i am sorry to have to
tell you so but the fact is young man you
are too much of a fool to ever make a good
railroader take my advice and quit i
took your advice and went into other busi-
ness and the result is i have made a fair
fortune i thank you for your counsel
what is your name i asked

  phil d armour of chicago replied
my ex-brakeman  and i shall always re-
member your kindness  was a stupid rail-
roader and you advised for my good

   until this interview added mr shel-
don  i never suspected that phil d

the broken shilling

s	the dusty buggy came to a
stop and its two occu-
pants made ready to get
to the ground the young
man at the drafting-table
in the tent looked up
from his work laid his compasses aside
and stepped quickly out into the open

   hallo smith said the man who
had been driving the lathery horse-a
heavy man with smooth - shaven cheeks
and a bunch of brown beard on his chin

   hallo mr garth replied the
young man shooting a swift glance at
the other man in the buggy

   ive brought mr briggs out ex-
plained garth letting his ponderous
frame lightly to the ground and turning
to his companion this is mr iarry
smith mr briggs

   glad of a glimpse of you at last
mr briggs said smith heartily step-
ping forward and extending his hand as
the stranger followed garth out of the
buggy- then after briggs had re-
servedly accepted his greeting and
acknowledged the introduction he shout-
ed hi there madden and a mo-
ment later a man came running from the
corral to get the visitors horse

   it requires strong lungs to make
ones self heard in this din remarked
briggs in an aside to garth

  the construction-work had just begun
again at the close of the hot silent
noon hour and the air sang with the
tap-tap-tap of drills the creaking of the
straining derricks the panting of the en-



gine and the shouts of the foremen the
long wall of the dam was rising stone
by stone and the steep slopes of the
mountains and the black cliffs that rose
from the upper edges of the slopes
frowned grimly down upon the few-score
human ants so busy at their lilliputian
task

  larry smith stood aside to let the two
visitors enter the tent he used the mo-
ment for a quick study of thomas
briggs the denver capitalist whom un-
til this moment he had not seen and he
noted that briggs was a thin-faced for-
mal man of fifty in appearance a law-
yer rather than a promoter of large en-
terprises

  larry could imagine him as he must
have been at twenty-a very hatchet of
a youth chopping his way through diffi-
culties keenly and attaining at last a
nervous victory over his environment
with that success the fountains of his
life appeared to have dried up

  larry did not like the man he had
keen precision it seemed and a certain
cool dry way of meeting events for
the rest it was impossible to read much
of what lay back of his pale eyes though
they expressed something which larry
found disturbing

   et those eyes had already in a brief
glance taken larrys measure they
had unerringly discovered his alertness
his honesty his enthusiasm and they
had inferred the specific happiness that
kept him smiling

  garth had bent over the blue-print on
the drafting-table whats this he
asked

   working plan for the elbow in the
pipe at the turn down there by the spur


the railroad mans magazine

of craigs peak when did you leave
denver mr briggs

   yesterday - with mr garjh we
have been going over matters as no
doubt you know

   and briggs is well satisfied put
in garth failing to see the momentary
frown of annoyance on the denver
mans brow  he considers that you
are making good progress wheres
marly

   out on the line he should be here
in a few minutes we both had to work
into the noon hour to-day i was about
to go up to the shack for a bite you
will come with me of course

  garth looked interrogatively at
briggs  thank you said briggs

	but i had something on the train a
couple of hours ago and i must catch
the afternoon express on to salt lake

   but mrs smith- insisted larry

   you have actually gone and got
married asked garth with a note of
surprised interest congratulations

   the week after you went to denver
were quite comfortable up there in the
shack

   im afraid i havent the time said
briggs with a faint but polite show of
reluctance  mr garth told me that
you either just had been or were about
to be married perhaps on my return
trip-

   we shall certainly hope to have you
at our table then said larry  but
if your time is so short now youll want
to have a quick look at things he
went jo the opening of the tent  here
comes marly now he said

  behind the broad back of garth the
face of thomas briggs became alive
with shrewd interest and he shifted his
position so that he might have a view
of the approaching figure a tall loose-
jointed young fellow it was ambling
easily up the road

  to a soft gray shirt and khaki riding-
breeches and puttees like larrys the
newcomer had added the touch of a
broad-brimmed hat and a red-and-black
silk handkerchief around his neck he
had a long good-natured face not lack-
ing in strength and quizzical humor
he waved his hand at garth and nod-
ded to briggs greeting the denver man
more elaborately when first introduced

  the four men went together to the
broken white wall of the rising dam
only a few weeks of work remained to
be done and murdock the contractor
pointed out to briggs at larrys request
the exact condition of the structure

  some of the sluices were not com-
pleted and the top wall had to be raised
several feet in the big stone power-
house below the dam the turbines and
dynamos were being installed

  larry smith was justly proud of his
work on this project he had discov-
ered the possibilities of a power-dam in
bendwater canon several years before
while he was doing a jo for a mining
company in larkin city and soon after-
ward had filed for water power secur-
ing control for a sixty-foot fall

  at the same time he had got options
on the cheap land above the dam-site so
as to provide for a- storage of eight
miles the one - thousand - dollar state
tax and the five hundred dollars for
the survey had used up a great part of
his savings but he had been able to have
borings made thus assuring himself that
the dam would have a safe -foundation
in solid trap

  about that time he had met jack
marly not long out of college an in-
teresting idler who after hearing lar-
rys account of the big chance in bend-
water canon offered to put four hun-
dred thousand dollars into the venture
the two young men had then gone to
larkin city and interested aaron garth
a local mining capitalist who agreed to
supply eight hundred thousand dollars

  for his rights larry was allowed a
quarter interest in the company so that
he and jack marly together controlled
exactly half the stock and garth the
other half strict provision w-as made
that neither party should acquire more
than fifty per cent

  now twelve hundred thousand dol-
lars in cash was not enough to see the
work through at least two millions
would be required although the dam-
site was favorable to easy construction

  therefore at garths suggestion a
short-term mortgage on the property had
been given to thomas briggs of den-
ver a former associate of garths by
the terms of which briggs had paid in
eight hundred thousand dollars after his
the dam-builders



confidential engineer had visited bend-
water canon and returned to denver
with a favorable report

  the original plan had been to sell the
electric power on future contracts while
the dam was in process of construction
and then on the strength of these con-
tracts to issue bonds from the sale of
which enough money would he realized
to pay off briggss mortgage but there
had followed a period of hard times

  the men in charge of the big stamp-
ing-mills at larkin city were loathe to
promise to instal the power within any
given period and several new projects
which would have used the power were
postponed larry and jack stood ready
to interest eastern capital but garth
apparently feared that eastern men
would ultimately secure control of the
whole plant

  at his suggestion therefore he was
authorized to negotiate with briggs for
a renewal of the mortgage by garths
account briggs had been reluctant but
finally he had agreed in writing on
two conditions

  his first condition was that the three
men in control of the stock should
make no effort to secure other capital
briggss reason for this demand was the
necessity of keeping up the value of the
property by the strictest kind of finance

  under the second condition the dam
was to be completed the machinery all
installed in the powr-house and the last
foot built of the stave pipe by which
the waste water was to lie conveyed over
klingerman pass farther down the
canon into mormon valley-all this by
the date on which the original mortgage
expired the irrigation of the arid
mormon valley was expected to prove
a highly profitable scheme

  despite garths urging larry and
jack had hesitated for some time before
accepting these conditions they had
recognized the predicament in which
they might find themselves if the work
were not finished within the time-limit

  at last however after studying the
situation over and over they had agreed
that had been six months ago and now
with four weeks to the end of the time-
limit the outlook was that only three
weeks would be required to complete the
work they were behind the original

   	r r

schedule by nearly a month but that was
no more than was to have been expected
considering the many unforeseen delays
that had come to pass

  therefore two weeks before briggs
made his flying visit to the plant iarry
smith had gone back to michigan to
marry mary andros and he had brought
his bride to the little shack which lie
had built on the mountainside

  this history revolved in jack marlys
mind as he helped larry show the plart
to the visitor he found briggs a puz-
zling disturbing personality the slen-
der capitalist might once have been an
outdoor man as garth said but plainly
he was not of late years accustomed to
moving about over rough footing for
he stumbled now and then and the ex-
ertion so told on him that frequently he
pulled out his handkerchief and mopped
his brow but his eyes traveled swiftly
from point to point taking in every de-
tail of the work he missed nothing

   where have  seen him before  
jack asked himself it came upon him
with a flash after a time and he
straightened his shoulders with a jerk
when he remembered but lie said noth-
ing - only watched briggs as he had
never watched a man in all his life

  it was an hour of elation for jack
and larry this was their first real
triumph - the opportunity to show
thomas briggs how much they had ac-
complished and yet they were cool
about it

  as larry was saying to briggs  of
course we have not finished yet after
all murdock will have to crowd in
fact he may have to put a night shift
on the pipe

   sorry i havent the time to go over
the pipe line to mormon valley

   well said larry  youve seen
how the pipe begins here below the
power-house and i guess you were able
to make out its course along the moun-
tainside while you were driving up

   you seem to have trenched it in
pretty well

   had to it must be protected from
falling rocks

   and this mormon valley that is to
be irrigated-you have bought it

   for a song without water it is
worthless


the railroad mans magazine

   a pocket in the mountains is it
not

   yes a tract about two miles square
with an easy grade for a road through
a narrow canon down to the plain any
waste water from the canals can run
down that canon and rejoin the bend-
waier out in the open country

   and your water - storage here -
when do you close the dam  

   as soon as the sluices are finished
-by the last of next week we think-
we will close them and collect enough
water to start the dynamos on the thir-
tieth

   of course briggs wrinkled his face
into a smile but there was a false note
in his voice  i have never had anything
much to do with power-dams before-
except as an auxiliary in mining well
garth 

   it looks like wed have to start back
if youre going to make that train said
garth pulling awkwardly at his bush
of beard

  larry and jack saw them off-the
self-contained briggs and their burly
partner then they turned and looked
at each other silently each felt ques-
tionings in his mind but neither of them
was ready to express a doubt

   come up to lunch said larry
 mary will be wondering what has hap-
pened to us

  jack nodded toward the drafting-
table how about that

  the blue-print its all ready
jackson will come and get it when they
want it

  they climbed side by side up the
slope

   its warm remarked jack

   yes larry gestured down the
canon slopes where the six-foot stave
pipe built of long bevel-edged strips of
oregon pine wound its seemingly end-
less length

  looks like a big worm doesnt it
he said but his eyes were on a tiny
distant cloud of dust which rose behind
garths buggy and he would have given
much to know what that formal little
man from denver was saying to garth
and jack marly he knew was also
wondering about briggs

  mary met them at the door of the
shack who was with mr garth

she asked  i had a glimpse of you
down at the dam she nodded down
toward the line of masonry

   briggs replied larry

  she looked at him further questions
in her brown eyes but he smiled quietly
and said nothing about the visitor
are you going to feed us he asked

  but she was already setting the dishes
on the table

   and how has the housewife been all
morning inquired marly

   awfully busy she laughed  wing
fah went down to larkin city three
hours ago to buy certain things which
he considers quite essential to cooking
he tried to tell me what they were but
i couldnt understand him

   youll gel used to his lingo dear
when youve been in the west a little
longer said larry  did he ride
down with one of the teamsters 

   i think he set out to walk the entire
distance-sixteen miles isnt it

  eight down eight back larry
sipped his tea

   id like to know- lie continued
meditatively then checked himself

  mary set down the platter she was
carrying and said  what would you
 ike to know larry

  he started something
about the work

    hi  slit- kritted her brows in per-
plexity - it was not like larry to bring
his worries into thisnoon hour but he
collected himself after a glance of warn-
ing and understanding at marly and
turned the talk upon light topics

  after luncheon the two men did not
linger they set off at once down the
slope leaving mary somewhat puzzled
when they were out of sight of the
shark larry suddenly halted jack im-
mediately seated himself upon a boulder
well said larry

well jack marly had taken
some trifle from his pocket and was turn-
ing it over and over in his fingers
somethings wrong said larry
yes jack drew a long breath
 yes somethings wrong

   i wish we had seen this man briggs
before continued larry  hes a
master he showed too much silent in-
terest in this property the fellow is
no mere money-lender
the dam-builders



   im afraid youre right larry
marly glanced down at the dam  sup-
pose we get at our own suspicions
what did you notice

   first of all  noticed that he didnt
ask questions enough

  jack nodded

   and then-oh pshaw i cant ex-
plain it jack it was the mans man-
ner  his quiet sureness less what he
said than what lie didnt say

   did you get onto the fact that he
and bill murdock were already ac-
quainted asked marly

   what

   im sure of it briggs was as in-
different as a piece of stone but mur-
dock gave a little jump as we came near
him and he looked at briggs and opened
his mouth as though he were going to
speak  caught a frown on briggss
forehead and garth seemed uneasy all
the time they were here

  for some time they stared moodily
down the canon their minds troubled
by vague surmises

   i hope we havent been blind fools
said larry- at last  perhaps its silly
to be disturbed by one mans personality
but when you come to think of it were
in a curious position-bound not to try
to draw any new capital to our aid and
bound to have this job done four weeks
from to-day

   why on earth should he have in-
sisted on that time-limit anyway de-
manded marly

   oh weve been all over that ground
jack as garth represented the case
it seemed a normal demand briggs
wanted some assurance that we would
push things he didnt care to promise
to renew the mortgage unless we proved
our good faith-and all that sort of
thing

  hes plausible commented marly

 quite plausible  

  larry straightened up and squared
his shoulders  three weeks will see
the- work done he said  and we have
four i dont believe we need worry
about it

  marly did not answer

  after all jack we have nothing to
disturb us except an unaccountable dis-
trust of a man we have seen only once
for a few minutes

   and the fact that he conceals his
previous acquaintance with our contrac-
tor drawled marly  it would be
mighty easy for bill murdock to delay
the game

   but murdock is under bonds

 true but -  marly broke off
short and tossed into the air the object
he had been fingering catching it as it
fell

  the gleam of it caught larrys atten-

   whats that thing jack he asked

   something briggs dropped when he
was taking out his handkerchief re-
plied marly it is a broken shilling

  larry reached for it the jagged line
of the old fracture formed the inner
edge of the irregular half-moon of silver
it had cut in two the head of good queen
victoria leaving the chin and lower
cheek and the neck there was the date
also-

   what do you make of it   asked
larry

   i dont know its a token or a
lucky-piece i suppose marly took the
fragment of coin and slipped il back
into his pocket

  but jack-larry spoke with sur-
prise- why didnt you give it back to
him  

   i dont know that either replied
marly slowly  i just kept it thats
all it means something-and anything
that means something about thomas
briggs is worth studying isnt it more
than that i dont believe his kind of
man needs a lucky-piece do you

        chapter ii
        the blue-print

t ack marly had a habit of keep-
 ing things to himself he drifted
along amiably upon the surface of life
and his deeper thoughts and feelings
were seldom in evidence the explana-
tion of this trait is that he had been
brought up by a stepfather who was a
taciturn rich corporation attorney and
he had learned in boyhood that persis-
tent silence was the best protection from
unpleasant criticism

  that same curious upbringing ac-
counted no doubt for the fact that the


the railroad mans magazine

lad had loafed through college learn-
ing little from the curriculum and much
from casual acquaintance with his fel-
low students his professors had des-
paired of him his stepfather had been
driven to sharp anger by their reports
but the total result of all this bother
was that he had managed to squeeze
through his examinations at the last

  shortly afterward his stepfather made
over to him the half-million dollars
which had been left in trust for him by
his mother  spend it as fast as you
like john he said but when it is
gone dont come back for more

   i shant replied john shortly
good-by mr harrington - for he
had never learned to address his step-
father in any other way

   good-by said the older man ex-
tending the cold fingers of his right
hand for a farewell hand-shake then
his mouth relaxed slightly and he
seemed about to speak after all he
was not altogether without sentiment for
this likable young fellow but jack
had turned ori his heel and was leaving
the office and the stepfather resumed his
reading of the documents on his desk

  jack promptly went abroad when
he returned two years later he had left
nearly a fifth of his fortune at monte
carlo-an error of judgment for which
he felt some disgust but no contrition

   why should i regret a lesson that i
needed he asked himself me sat ro
more at green tallies however but wan-
dered genially from new york to chi-
cago and back as far as detroit avoid-
ing old friends as much as might be and
making many new ones thus he came
across larry smith liked him and de-
cided to risk the remainder of his money
in the bendwater canon scheme

  he had never told larry about his
stepfather nor about monte carlo nor
did he tell larry now that when he saw
thomas briggs he recognized him

  he had never actually met briggs be-
fore but once in new york he had
seen the man leaving his stepfathers
office and his stepfather had said to him
afterward  that was a man who
should be in prison

  nothing more than that but jack
had never forgotten his stepfathers
words or the face of the stranger his

stepfather was not a man to make such
a statement without warrant

  and now the  man who should be
in prison  held the mortgage on this
property and garth was his former as-
sociate and unless the work were com-
pleted in four weeks the mortgage
would unquestionably be foreclosed and
that in spite of all garths hearty as-
surances that mr briggs was good na-
tured that mr briggs would never
dream of foreclosing that the only rea-
son mr briggs insisted on a time-limit
was to protect himself against the pos-
sibility of the work not being pushed
ahead so rapidly as it should be

  more than this jack found himself
considering various ways by which un-
scrupulous persons might easily delay
the completion of the dam larry and
he in such an event might shout  con-
spiracy   till they were black in the
face but the courts of the state would
never decide in favor of the two young
men as against garth and briggs on
such an elusive charge

  larry was above all else an engineer
he did not pretend to an elaborate ac-
quaintance with the crooked ways of
finance and while he knew that the pos-
sibilities of trickery were by  means
small in the bendwater scheme he was
too busy with technical problems of con-
struction to give much thought to the
other side of the game

  though lie had suspected briggs he
was inclined to dismiss his own sus-
picions jack felt therefore that the
greater part of the burden of watchful-
ness must fall upon him

  that was doubtless as it should be
since he was of no real help in the con-
structive work he had been perform-
ing such duties as larry could delegate-
to him  the pipe line but he knew
that a twentv-five-dollar-a-month inspec-
tor could do them just as well here
at last was a real job for him

  later in the afternoon larry came
upon him in the drafting-tent  ive
been thinking about briggs he began
 do you know jack i believe that
manner of his is pure vanity-a desire
to appear sure about matters of which
lie knows little it is the pose of the
capitalist eh  

   perhaps replied jack
the iam-ih tldi-us



   barring cloudbursts or earthquakes
continued larry  we have nothing to
worry about

  jack meditated  you dont really
need me on the work do you he said
at last

  well -  larry hesitated of
course its a joy to me to have you with
me the words jack knew were sin-
cere

   but theres nothing  am doing that
ives cant do

    shall have to admit it smiled
larry  hut you understand-

   then suppose you figure without
me for a few days larry there may
be nothing in our suspicions of briggs
but im going to keep an eye out leave
that to me you have your hands full
with other matters

    just as you like jack  

  a shadow darkened the entrance to
the tent the big frame of bill mur-
dock stooped and came in  got that
blue-print ready for the elbow in the
pipe mr smith he asked the
gang needs it

   why -larry glanced at the table
-didnt you get it  left it here all
ready for you when i went up to lunch
 havent seen it said murdock in-
differently  didnt want it till now
jack scanned murdocks face and it
seemed to him alive with hard cunning

   i dont see how it could have blown
away larry was hunting about  are
you sure one of your foremen didnt
get it

   the foremen asked me for it ex-
plained murdock

  they made a thorough search but the
blue-print was not to be found  i had
marked the alterations on it too said
larry thoughtfully  thats a days
job well murdock put your men on
the lower section ill mark up another
print and you can have it by to-morrow
noon keep busy on the pipe

  all right murdock departed

    so theyre beginning to lose things
mused jack to himself but larry was
saying funny about that print this
is the only time anything has been lost
i told murdock i would leave it on the
table for him and its the last im-
portant working-plan too the rest of
the pipe is plain straight work

  jack did not reply he went down
to the corral and told madden to saddle
a pony and presently mounted on a
nervous mustang started up the canon

  he followed the bridle-path that
wound up at one side of the dam-site
and descended to the old road a few hun-
dred feet above he wished to ride a
long way for it was his experience that
nothing cleared his brain like horse-
back riding

  he looked down at the top of the
gray uneven wall of the dam scores
of men were busy building the blocks of
stone into place  thers were working
below at the sluices

  soon the waters of the stream would
be hemmed in behind this masonry fort-
ress and slowly a lake would form be-
tween the narrow walls of the valley
extending back half a mile then a mile
then two miles and so on for six or
eight miles almost to  sweden as the
little valley at the distant head of the
canon was known

  how the waters would press against
the dam  how sullenly they would re-
sent their imprisonment and search cun-
ningly for every tiny crack by which
they might secretly undermine the struc-
ture and escape to their old freedom

  but the dam would hold if it ever
goes down larry had often said to him
 i hope that i shall be under it

  the mustang shied a bit of paper
had floated into the path

  jack glanced down it was a small
irregular bit of white paper and it was
charred at the edges suddenly a puff
of breeze whirled it over and on the side
which was now uppermost its color was
a rich deep blue

  jack was on the ground in an instant
as he had guessed the paper was part
of a blue-print several white lines
crossed it but there was not enough of
the original plan to admit of identifi-
cation

  the explanation seemed simple some
one had thrust a blue-print into one of
the forges and the charred piece had
floated up into the hood and out at the
chimney but he could not prove that
this was part of the plan that had dis-
appeared from  the drafting-tent it
might he a piece of a print that was
spoiled in the making


the railroad mans magazine

  iio folded the charred paper and put
it into his memorandum-book with little
expectation that he would ever find a
use for it then remounting the pony
he continued at an easy lope on up the
canon which widened as he proceeded
until it was a comfortable valley with
a quarter-mile strip of bottom-land

  within a few months all this valley
would le under water the few cabins
separated by intervals of a mile or more
had already been abandoned by their
owners

  jacks thoughts returned to the blue-
print he felt morally certain that bill
murdock knew something about its dis-
appearance if thomas briggs and
aaron garth had conspired to hinder the
completion of the work in order that the
mortgage might be foreclosed profitably
to them they would probably have to
work through murdock

  of course murdock being under bond
to finish the work on time would so
arrange as to make larry apparently re-
sponsible for the delays a multiplica-
tion of such incidents as the disappear-
ance of the blue-print might easily set
the work behind a full week

  superficially he had only the barest
suspicion that briggs and garth were
planning to freeze him and larry out
yet he knew that such things were often
done and done so carefully that it was
almost impossible to prove the fact

  briggss character and his manner had
made jack certain that something was
wrong  and the prize at stake would be
very much worth while to briggs and
garth for the property might easily be
worth five or six millions after a few
years

  larry and jack had indeed considered
the possibility of a freeze-out from the
time when they first got garth to go in
with them but they had known that in
this regard chances had to be taken

  until this day it had not occurred to
either of them that any one would actu-
ally tamper with the work itself  and
larry doesnt believeit now muttered
j ack

  the valley was now widening out into 
an amphitheater several square miles in
extent this was  sweden comprising
a dozen we -irrigated firms occupied by
norwegians who had immigrated thither

from minnesota several years before to
the people of larkin city and the vicin-
ity all scandinavians were  swedes a
belief which accounted for the misnam-
ing of this settlement

  jack had not for many months ridden
so far formerly the people of  swe-
den  had used bendwater canon as
their principal road to larkin city six-
teen miles away but since the building
of the dam had begun they had been
obliged to use a longer road through an-
other canon

  one of larrys most difficult promises
had been that as soon as the reservoir
was full he would have a new road dug
out of the side of the mountains in the
upper part of bendwater canon to take
the place of the section of road which
would be covered by the water

  the stream which left  sweden  a
considerable body of water was there
formed by several distinct branches-
rushing brooks which sparkled through
green fields of grain and alfalfa there
was also a network of small irrigation
ditches dug by the thrifty norwegians
it was a garden spot this  sweden set
like a jewel among the mountains

  jack reined in and sat looking over
the green prospect the only taint in
the fine clear air was the smoke rising
from the chimneys of the scattered farm-
houses which squatted here and there
like gray excrescences amid the brilliant
fields

   mormon valley will be just such
another paradise when we get the water
in thought jack

  he rode forward for perhaps a quar-
ter of a mile tt was in his mind to get
a glimpse of some of the people of
 sweden presently the road turned
and he came to a bridge crossing a little
stream

  the nearest house was still a third of
a mile beyond he stopped at the bridge
and throwing the reins over the ponys
head climbed down to get a drink

  hut as he glanced up-stream through
the green field he saw something that
made him exclaim not more than a
hundred feet away lying among the
rocks at the waters edge was the body
of a woman the high alfalfa had shut
her off from his view as he approached
the bridge
the dam-builders



  she was motionless and her white
face was turned up to the sky without
pausing to consider jack hurried toward
her

chapter iii
thekla

yjhen jack came close to the body
 he saw that it was that of a girl
dressed in a flannel blouse and a short
skirt of some rough gray material her
face was very lovely straight-featured
and crowned with a glory of fine-spun
yellow hair but the eyes were closed

  at a glance she seemed to him like a
sleeping princess but her breast did not
perceptibly rise and fall with the breath
of life dead or alive she was not
sleeping and indeed he dared not hope
that she lived

  as he knelt beside her his foot struck
something which proved to be a trout-
rod not a clumsy cheap pole but a
delicate whip of split bamboo a creel
which was still caught around her shoul-
der by its thin strap lay on the ground
beside her the cover had fallen open
and a ten-inch mountain-trout still ra-
diantly gleaming with moisture lay
within

   lie laid his hand on the girls left side
at his touch she suddenly stirred like
one in a dream and his heart bounded
as he realized that she was not dead

  dipping his hand in the stream he
sprinkled her face she sighed deeply
the closed eyelids which he was watch-
ing so intently fluttered wavered slow-
ly opened and two deep blue eyes stared
for a moment unseeingly into his then
the lids fell again

  he chafed the limp hands-fine hands
they were and seemingly unroughened by
toil presently she gave a little moan
and looked at him again  what hap-
pened she asked in a dazed whisper

  i dont know said jack calmly
  found you here better not try to
talk yet

  she lay silent for some time then she
said   remember now i was fishing
she groped for the creel  my foot
slipped andmy head struck when i fell

she tried to struggle to a sitting pos-
ture and lie put his arm about her

shoulders and helped her  all  she
exclaimed with a wry little smile  my
head aches and i am dizzy

    then dont try to sit up

   oh yes she said reassuringly  i
am hardy the dizziness will soon pass
away

  if you will let me help you to this
boulder you will have something to lean
against

  without permitting her to rise he
drew her gently across the two or three
feet of ground and she leaned back
against the boulder then she probed
her hair with her fingers

   this was the place she said winc-
ing at the touch of her own fingers

   let me see jack carefully parted
the coils of yellow hair discovering a
bump of considerable proportions she
submitted quietly to the examination pro-
longed by the fart that the fascination
which the hair had for him was con-
stantly distracting his attention from the
injury in the network of those golden
strands his thoughts were much entan-
gled but soon he seated himself where
he could look upon the greater marvel of
her face

    there is no fracture she said

   plow can you be sure without an
examination he inquired anxiously

  she laughed in an amusement which
he did not comprehend   made the
examination with my own fingers she
said

  vet she had not objected when he had
followed her examination with his own
he did not press the matter

    i infer that you are feeling better
he remarked

   much very soon i shall get up
and go on with my fishing she reached
for her rod and pliantly swished it
through the air to make certain that it
had not been hurt it bent nearly double
at the motion of her lithe wrist

   do you know said jack leaning
on his elbow and gazing at her with un-
hidden admiration  if there had only
been a bit of prairie-fire hereabouts when
 discovered you i should have taken you
to be brunhild

  she raised her straight eyebrows
brunhild a fishing she inquired
her mouth twitching into a faint smile

  why not even a valkyr must eat


the railroad mans magazine

   and discovered lv a cowboy sieg-
fried 

  he colored  oh these things he
said confusedly indicating his hat and
knotted handkerchief  i suppose they
do have a tenderfootish look

  she smiled

   but  enjoy em he added  and
my name im sorry to say is not sieg-
fried its jack marly

  through the fringes of her long eye-
lashes she searched his face and my
name she said at last  is thekla

   that might be a valkyrs name said
jack dreamily

   thekla wist she added with pretty
decision

  jack roused himself from his reverie
 hen you must be peter wists daugh-
ter lie ventured she nodded

  jack knew of peter wist the head
man of this norwegian settlement the
judge mayor almost king by informal
recognition of his compatriots for the
norwegians of  sweden  were a law
unto themselves they did not carry
their disputes to the courts at larkin
city and as they paid their state taxes
without demur and were as orderly as
any superior government could wish they
were not interfered with

  larry however had had trouble with
peter wist the old norwegian stub-
bornly refused to approve of the bend-
water dam since he would not be con-
vinced that it promised increased values
on the property at  sweden

  he was suspicious formal written
promises barely assured him that the
road - through bendwater canon would
be rebuilt after the reservoir was full
and he resented even the temporary ne-
cessity of using the longer rougher road
to larkin city through willow canon

   well said jack at last  if you
arc peter wists daughter im afraid
you will think of me as an enemy

   how could  slie asked simply
 after you have been a good samaritan
to me 

   but i am one of the men down there
at the dam

   i know she smiled again gravely
 there are worse things than the dam
but the people up here are slow to see
the value of what is new they dread
the uncertainty of change

  a trout leaped in a pool ten feet away
from them she raised her left hand to
urge his silence then taking up the rod
made a snap-cast the fly soared deli-
cately to the water and under the girls
deft manipulation seemed to be strug-
gling to wing its way upward again
but the trout did not strike and she
drew in the line

   my fly-book she whispered  it
must have slipped from my pocket

  jack peered about until he found it
close to the serried edge of the alfalfa
she opened it and taking out a  par-
machenee belle looped it at the end of
the leader removing the  professor
which she had been using

    isnt the  belle  rather bright for
this country asked jack

   the larger trout seem to take it
she answered and indeed the fleck
of red and white had not struck the
water before the misled fish leaped and
caught it

  a beauty exclaimed jack

  the color had returned to the girls
cheeks gently coaxingly but firmly
she brought the trout toward the bank
tack meantime hunted about until he
found the landing-net

  but the fish was not so easily to be
mastered twice he fought his way back
to the depths of the pool-now rushing
now sulking near the bottom and it was
fully ten minutes before jack got the
net under it and scooped it up to the
bank where it lay flopping in the meshes

    kill it please she said and jack
with his pocket-knife stabbed deeply
into the back of the head

    it is at least twenty inches he said
estimating it with his eye  better carry
it in the net

  she nodded and began to take her
rod apart

    do you feel able to walk  he asked

   quite my head aches of course
that is to be expected but it will wear
away now-well i will take your arm
as far as the road

  he helped her to her feet she
seemed a little shaky but resolute they
walked slowly to the bridge jacks
mustang was grazing near by he went
and caught it and led it back to her

    you will ride he said

  she thanked him  but the fish 
the dam-builders



she exclaimed  that is supper and i
have only one other

  so he gave her the bridle and went
back to get the fish when he returned
she was seated on the pony and he
walked silently beside the animal which
she held down to a slow pace

  arent you going to say anything
she asked

  he looked up at her and found her
smile pleasantly quizzical   am glad
i came to you when i did valkyr lie
remarked

  she did not wound him by pointing
out that if he had not come she would
undoubtedly have recovered conscious-
ness and made her way home alone in-
stead she said simply

   so am i you have been very kind
then she too relapsed strangely into
silence

  the house which they approached was
a homely compact structure with plen-
tiful evidence of thrift and industry in
the neatness of the door-yard and tlw
absence of rust on the farm machinery
under the sheds she halted the pony
and slipped to the ground

    this is my home she said  now
if you will just lay the fish there and
thank you again for being a cowboy
siegfried perhaps it was the realiza-
tion of what the allusion might mean to
him that made her blush

   if began jack twirling his hat in
his hand  if i were to ride this way to-
morrow do you think that you would be
fishing that same stream

    it is possible she smiled   but i
never know what  may be busy about
to-morrow good-by

  he waited until she had disappeared
into the house then slowly mounted and
rode at a walk down to the canon
again and again his mind reviewed the
incidents of the hour while his imagina-
tion interrupted his thoughts with eager
questionings and surmises

  such a vision in such a place a
very brunhild with a womanvq tender-
ness more than the valkyrs

  and then he exclaimed aloud so sud-
denly that the pony misunderstanding
broke into a lope this girl thekla
wist daughter of peter wist the nor-
wegian farmer had spoken with an eng-
lish as pure as his own

  she had been fishing the stream with
tackle that must have lieen bought in an
eastern shop and she had handled the
irod like an experienced fly-fisherman
she had capped his allusions to myth-
ology-not so surprising perhaps since
the mythology was norse  but she had
talked to him with a social ease which
surely could not have been acquired in
the homes of immigrant farmers

  how could all this be inasmuch as she
was thekla wist vainly he questioned
himself for a solution of the mystery
he could not but believe that she was
what she had claimed to be and his only
conclusion was that he would ride again

lo	 sweden  on the following day in
the hope of seeing her

  the upper canon narrowed toward the
dam-site and he left the road for the
bridle-path that led above the dam work
had ceased for the day already the
sun had sunk below the mountains the
men would be at supper now and larry
and mrs larry would be looking for
him at the shack

  he wondered how things had gone with
larry during the afternoon whether he
had made the alterations on a second copy
of the blue-print thomas briggs-must
be well on his way to salt lake by this
time and garth what would garth lie
doing

  madden was not in the corral so jack
himself unsaddled the pony then he
walked back to the beginning of the path
that led up to the shack passing on the
way the long tent in which the workmen
were at supper

  fragments of their rough talk floated
out to him and there was a steady clatter
of knives on tin plates a little farther
along he noticed a solitary figure seated
on a log near the power-house and look-
ing toward the dam it was hill mur-
dock no other man in the camp had
such broad stooping shoulders

  jack hesitated he would give much
to kiow murdocks thoughts he stepped
quietly forward and when he was near
the log lie said suddenly

  hallo bill

  murdock leaped to his feet with an
oath  then recognizing jack slowly re-
sumed his seat  you gave me a start
he said

  did i jack inquired cheerfully


the railroad mans magazine

seating himself  i didnt know your
thoughts were so far away

  murdock made no answer whatever
the problem in his brain he was not dis-
posed to talk about it his dull blue eyes
were again closely fixed on the wall of
the dam

  slowly jack took his memorandum-
book from his pocket and slipped out
the piece of charred blue-print he
fixed his eyes on it and waited for mur-
dock to notice it but the contractor still
stared moodily away

  at last jack began to make the paper
crackle in his fingers he was conscious
that murdock was turning his head  and
then suddenly the contractor shot out
his right hand as though to seize the
incriminating piece of the print

  but before he touched it he realized
how greatly such an action might betray
him and drew his hand back not know-
ing that he had already verified jacks
suspicions when jack glanced at him
the contractor was again looking in the
direction of the dam but his eyes were
partly shut in an expression of cunning

  well remarked jack  i guess ill
go get my supper he arose slipped
the bit of paper into his pocket stretched
himself and began his climb up to the
shack

  he was now convinced that bill mur-
dock had destroyed the blue-print and
that being so its destruction could have
but one purpose the delaying of the
work moreover the fact obvious to his
eyes that thomas briggs had former
acquaintance with murdock and that
they had tried to conceal this acquaint-
ance was evidence of some collusion be-
tween the contractor and the capitalist
jack felt that the situation was rapidly
rounding out

  he wondered however whether he had
not made a mistake in letting him see the
bit of blue paper the contractor might
realize now that jack was suspicious
and he would be on his guard

  it would have been better to turn the
matter aside nonchalantly to act as
though he had just picked the paper up
and was idly curious about it and then
to toss it away as if it were of no con-
sequence instead of returning it to his
pocket with such marked care

  however the mistake could not be cor-

rected if murdock was now on guard
he himself would simply have to be more
watchful of murdock

  more and more jack was determined
to say as little as possible to larry about
the evidence of a conspiracy for larry
had his hands full with the details of
the work itself worry would hinder
him and it was fortunate perhaps that
he had dismissed the suspicions which
sprang up in him at the meeting with
thomas briggs all of larrys energy
must be devoted to the task of seeing to
it that the plant was completed on time

  it would be difficult jack knew to
defeat single-handed the machinations of
briggs and garth and murdock he
was not experienced in the tricks that
they were likely to employ but the
difficulties of his undertaking he found
stimulating rather than discouraging

  dimly he realized that he had needed
a spur for his abilities-some stimulus of
combat to arouse him from his lazy in-
difference and he was genuinely elated
by the prospect of- matching his energies
against the schemes of the others

  his own money had almost all been
built into this dam and power-house and
pipe-line if it were lost to him he
would soon be as poor as the humblest
irish workman on the job-poorer in
fact since he had no trade

  but the money he discovered was a
small part of his concern pride was
miore-pride in himself now for the
first time in his life devoted to a serious
constructive piece of work  and pride in
larry whose engineering talent had
made this plant possible for like him-
self larry had staked everything on
success

  now that he was convinced of the
general intention of briggs and his allies
he was prepared to consider more defi-
nitely the methods they were likely to
employ to carry out that purpose an
accumulation of such delays as the one
caused by the destruction of the blue-
print yes but such delays could not
now be made very frequent since he
was known by murdock to be watchful

  moreover there was always the chance
that larry would find ingenious ways
of getting things done circumventing
murdocks efforts delays of that kind
could be but partially effective and they
this dam-buildkrs



v ould not lo bhemain rcliancoof thomas
briggs

  a strike if murdocks men were to
walk out just before the work was com-
pleted the result would be fatal to jack
and larrys interests there was no
strike clause in the contract with mur-
dock he remembered for a strike in
such a place as this seemed so improb-
able that murdock apparently had been
willing to waive all protection for him-
self in that regard

  then since there was no strike clause
in the contract murdocks failure to
complete the work on account of a strike
would leave him liable to the amount of
his bond it was a heavy bond too
but it flashed upon jack that thomas
itriggs could well afford to pay it if he
could get control of the property by fore-
closure

  this thought put an idea in his head
after supper while mrs larry was
attempting to make the imperturbable
wing ah understand her wishes for
the following day larry and he sat
puffing at their pipes on the bench in
front of the shack

  the mountains loomed blackly all
around them and in the gulf below
faint luminous patches indicated the
location of the tents of the workmen
up to the shack came occasional snatches
of song above the heavy diapason of the
bendwater tumbling over its boulders

   larry said jack scratching a
match to relight his pipe  the masonry
work on the dam is the remaining part
of the work that requires the least skilled
labor isnt it

   yes said jack

  and the completion of the sluices and
the pipe-line takes skill

  yes and the installation of the ma-
chinery  

   well- jack hesitated  i want

to he co

to make a suggestion you know our
suspicions about briggs f course
there may be nothing in it but just to
be on the safe side to minimize the dif-
ficulties that would come if bill-mur-
docks men should go on strike toward
the last-

    strike 

  always possible isnt it

    hardly  not up here  

   but it might happen you never
can tell for sure what notion will get
into the heads of a gang of men just
to be safe why dont you make mur-
dock put on the pipe-line all the men
now at the dam then if anything
should happen the pipe would be done
and only the easy masonry work left
larry seemed dubious

    it wont take long to finish the pipe
will it inquired jack

   about ten days if we put all the
men on it replied larry after a swift
mental estimate

   then do it 

  larry argued that it was better to
carry all parts of the work along to-
gether sending for extra men toward
the last if it should be necessary but
jack was pleasantly persistent and at
last larry said 

    well ill try it for a couple of days
and see how we get along meantime the
machinery men who have nothing to do
with murdock as you know will go on
with their work still i shall hate not
to see the dam rise a little farther every
day tack

   so shall i said jack   but i be-
lieve the precaution is wise

  could they have forseen events they
would have realized that wise precau-
tion strength of will and strength of
arm would scarce avail them against the
wily subtlety of their secret foe and the
crude brutality of his tools

  	the emf in wireless telegraphy can
be anything from  to  volts depending
upon the energy required ie the length of

  the supreme court has recently rendered
an opinion sustaining the constitutionality
of this law in regard to the matter of
private cars the act to regulate commerce
defines the powers of the interstate com-
merce commission in the exercise of such
powers the law provides that if the owner
of property transported under this act di-
rectly or indirectly renders any service con-
nected with such transportation or fur-
nishes any instrumentality used therein the
charge and allowance therefor shall be 
more than  just and reasonable etc
therefore the payment or allowance of
more than a reasonable amount for the use
of private cars would be in the nature of
an advantage and result in unlawful dis-
crimination

subject to this act to be or remain on duty
for a longer period than sixteen consecu-

ployee of such common carrier shall have

and no such employee who has been on duty
sixteen hours in the aggregate in any twen-

  common report has it that the first rail-
way line in the united states was a short
stretch of track on beacon street boston
massachusetts in  the first line of
which there is uiidisputable record was one
three-quarters of a mile long constructed
by thomas dieper in delaware county
pennsylvania in s

  this was -followed by several tram-roads
of similar character the most important of
which was the one from quincy to newport
massachusetts three miles long built in
 the remains of this road can still be
seen on the west quincy branch of the
new york new haven and hartford rail-
road but a short distance outside of the city
of boston the first railroad in the united
states designed and built to be operated
by steam locomotives was the south caro-
lina in 

 between the years ss and  the
present elaborate system of railroad com-


the railroad mans magazine

munication in the united states may be
said to have beeu started by the commence-
ment of the baltimore and ohio the balti-
more and susquehanna the camden and
amboy the newcastle and frenchtown the
hudson and mohawk the charleston and
augusta the boston and providence the
boston and lowell and others

  if the baltimore and ohio be excepted
from the above list it will be seen that
there was little foresight of future great
connecting systems the baltimore and
ohio and at a later date the pennsylvania
roads connected the ohio river with bal-
timore and philadelphia while the mobile
and ohio connected that river with the
gulf hence these may be called the first
through lines

  some of the above names of old roads
can scarcely be recognized now but the
baltimore and susquehanna and camden
and amboy are now in the pennsylvania
group the hudson and mohawk is in the
new york central lines the boston and
providence has been absorbed by the new
york new haven and hartford and the
boston and maine system has the boston

a a j warrensburg missouri-the
 time-honored cross-head question
lias been thrashed over many times in this
department of the the railroad maxs
magazine and singularly enough your
view that the cross-head remains stationary
has been gravely advocated by many good
mechanics notwithstanding the evident fal-
lacy

  the cross-liead of a locomotive certainly
moves from the front to the back end of
the guides while the wheel to which it is to
all intent and purpose connected through
the medium of the rods is making a half-
turn and returns from the back to the
front end of the guides and to its original
position while the wheel is making the other
half-turn to complete the revolution

  bear in mind diat the progressive motion
of the locomotive on the rails is entirely
dependent on this action of the cross-head
if any proof is necessary that this action
exists we might call your attention to the
fact that the valves are so adjusted as to
admit an equal quantity of steam at each
end of the cylinder as needed and the fact
that four equally spaced exhausts occur
with each revolution of the driving-wheels
affords satisfactory evidence that each
cross-head has made a round trip through its
respective set of guide-bars and that the
steam has fulfilled its mission in each end
of the cylinder



    hat is meant by the  draft appli-
      ances of a locomotive

                        c b olean n y

  what are known as the draft appliances
of a locomotive include the dampers the
ash-pan the grates the appliances inside the
smoke-box and the smoke-stack the ash-
pan and grate should be so constructed that
the air will pass to the fire with as little
obstruction as possible and the lire gases
should pass uniformly through the different
rows of tubes it is to regulate this flow of
the gases through the tubes that a lift-pipe
or diaphragm is placed in the smoke-box
without these the tendency of tin- unre-
strained gases is to pass through the upper
rows of tubes losing the use for heating
surface of the lower tubes and permitting
them to choke up with cinders and soot

  	the practise of fining railroads for
failure to maintain their schedules which
was in vogue heretofore has been discon-
tinued becoming effective july t rio the
postmaster-general ruling that inasmuch as
congress had omftted this provision from
the current appropriation act and it was
applicable only to the fiscal year to which
the act applied it should he discontinued
the only tines are for neglect to forward

tal laws

   	statistics are not entirely clear regard-
ing the exact width of the first narrow-
gage track in his country that is the gage
narrower than the present four feet eight
and one-half-inch standard it is said that
the quincy granite road built in s was
forty-four inches wide some say fifty-two
inches

  at one time in the united states there


the railroad mans magazine

were five different widths of track from
thirty-six inches to six feet and the ad-
vantage of uniformity in track forced itself
ultimately to the attention of railway man-
agement to the triumph of the present
standard this was the same reason which
resulted in this standard in england not
its mechanical superiority to any other gage
but in view of the extent of roads in opera-
tion with that width of gage

cb waldoboro maine-the easiest

	way to get this information at first
hand would be to write the united fruit
company direct as the clipping enclosed
with your letter states that they own the
line in question we have no record of it
here do not place dependence to any great
extent on the alluring prospects held out for
railroading in foreign lands and in the
tropics least of all

  you have noticed this advice frequently
in the lantern department  doubt and
we trust that it has at least been instrumen-
tal in causing thorough inquiry to be made
before any contract is signed to analyze
the clipping you sent develops the conclu-
sion that it looks like a fake these roads
in the tropics prefer to develop the native
labor in all capacities even to running the
engines and doing the important shop work
because the natives are acclimated do not
become homesick and will work for about
one-quarter of what you would expect

  there may be a few americans of course
to balance this element but it is absurd to
assume that the entire personnel of the
road will be whites- at high salaries in
gold the clipping may set forth the facts
and if so the general manager of the line
is entitled to sincere sympathy vve cannot
think of any stiller proposition than the ef-
fort to keep the american labor contented

day

wiiat is the difference between a com-
pound and a simple locomotive

         	what is the largest locomo-
tive in the world

  	the highest paid engineer running a
locomotive in the united states

  	the fastest speed which could be kept
up by a very high speed locomotive for half
a mile under the best conditions

  	what is the highest price ever paid
for a locomotive

  	what will be the weight and length
of the new articulated locomotive which is
being built for the santa fe

  	what other illustrated railroad tech-
nical magazine besides those which you fre-
quently mention in the  lantern  depart-
ment g d montreal que

  	the simple expansion locomotive
which is the prevailing type uses the steam
once in each of the two cylinders there-
upon exhausting it to the atmosphere
through the smoke-stack in the com-
pound locomotive steam enters first the
high-pressure cylinder and after doing its
work on the piston is exhausted at reduced
pressure into the low-pressure cylinder and
thus made to perform more work before
being finally ejected to the atmosphere
compound locomotives made their advent
about twenty years ago the theory of re-
expansion of the steam which is the basic
principle of the compound type is correct
and some roads invested heavily in them
it was found however after many years of
experimenting that the complication of
parts which is the inevitable result of com-
pounding and the ensuing excessive cost of
maintenance more than offset any economy
in fuel and the type began gradually to dis-
appear there is a very small proportion
left compared with ten years ago

  the compound types then were the two-
cylinder and four-cylinder in the former
the steam exhausting from the high pres-
sure cylinder  the left side across the
smoke-box to the low-pressure cylinder on
the right side and thence passing to the
stack in the latter type a low-pressure
cylinder was placed in immediately below
the high-pressure  each side or above it
in the instance of a freight-engine
by the light of the lantern

  later types are the balanced compound
in which the high-pressure cylinders are
arranged to be between the frames and
drive a cranked axle while the low-pressure
are outside the frames and connected to
the wheels in the usual manner through the
medium of the piston and rod cross-head
main rod ami crank-pins the articulated
compound is a flexible engine pivoted in the
center with the high-pressure cylinders
driving the rear engine and the exhaust
steam from these cylinders filling the low-
pressure cylinders ahead which drive the
forward engine quite a few of these have
been constructed of late for service on
heavy mountain grades

  	the largest locomotive in the world
in the sense you view it is the new mallet
articulated compound built at the baldwin
locomotive works ibis year for the south-
ern pacific company the total weight of
this engine is  pounds of which

	pounds is on the driving wheels
the total length of the engine is  feet 
inches and of the engine and tender s feet

	inches

  the diameter of the high-pressure cylin-
ders is  inches and that of the low-pres-
sure  inches the total heating surface
is  feet and the steam-pressure 
pounds per square inch

  the erie railroad articulated compounds
which were the largest up to the construc-
tion of the above engine have a less total
weight viz  pounds but as these
engines have  truck in front or rear all
of this weight is  the drivers against

	pounds for the southern pacific
engine in consequence the tractive effort
of the erie engine is  pounds exceed-
ing slightly that of the southern pacific en-
gine which is  pounds

  	it is difficult to answer this question
with any more than approximate correct-
ness engineers are paid by the month as
a rule and the size of the check depends
on the miles which have been made since
last pay-day we know a great many engi-
neers on many roads but the highest regu-
lar monthly pay is  and this is  a
double-crewed job where each man makes
fifteen round trips per month

  	this would have to be determined by
a test run it is claimed that on one occa-
sion on the atlantic city railroad  miles
was run in  minutes considerably over 
miles an hour so many elements enter
into the problem viz weight of train
weather condition of track etc etc that
to answer you any other way would be of
little value one mile in  seconds is the
best authentic record made several years ago
by the empire state express

     r r

  	-we have heard but not authoritative-

purpose intended for this reason it would
be rather difficult to secure a patent unless
your device is absolutely original a sketch
is all that is required at the patent office
but in such a small affair as a bolt would

  it certainly cannot leave without author-
ity although this authority need not neces-
sarily be  order a message from the
superintendent saying that the first section
of no  had passed would suffice the
fact that the first section passed without
markers leaves a doubt as to them having
the entire train and this being the case
whether second section had arrived or not
the freight should have notification that the
first section was intact it is of course
permissible to proceed by flagging ahead as

the erie railroad might be mentioned as
an example the operators are examined
with the same thoroughness accorded the
trainmen but station-agents whose duties
do not bring them in active contact with the
train service are exempt the examination
consists in reading from wall type and dr

 being a boomer brakeman

by horace herr

 rioomer  or stinger or  wheel-polisher -perhaps it is all the
 same any okl-tinie brakeman will know what is meant by any one
of those three terms they are taken from the good old lingo of the
railroad each word has its special place in the railroad mans dictionary

   perhaps  boomer  is the best known and most widely used but mr
herr calls him a  stinger in the bright lexicon of the railroad there is-
but what of that get acquainted with the hero of these yarns quickly
pies delivering the real goods

-breaking into the game

railroading was not his choice of a profession but after butting
against fate for a few days he was glad to have
a great future thrust upon him

  when i drifted west i wasnt really
train-broke although i was broke in eve-
ry other sense of the word  didnt
know the difference between an air-hose
and a janney coupler and what is more
my ignorance wasnt keeping me awake
nights at that time  didnt know that
those minor details were a qualification
for a division superintendent and i real-
ly did not anticipate the necessity of ac-
cepting anything below that position

  but when  got out there in arizona
surrounded on three sides by red ants and
sand and on the fourth by sand and red
ants two thousand miles from ray paren-
tal boarding-house with an unsympa-
thetic chinese standing guard in the door-
way of every bean garage there was
nothing to do but break into the game
which has been worrying harriman

  i wasnt specially qualified for a place
but there is a great satisfaction in know-
ing that your christian and surname are
known to the paymaster and that once a
month there will be a few pieces of the
 taint  coming to you
ioi

          ix railroading was not
my choice of a profession
any young man who has
flirted with a college edu-
cation is apt to have in-
grown vision when it comes
to seeing anything heroic in the life of a
switchman or a brakeman and lies prob-
ably more expert at shuffling cardboards
than cars

  but you know how it is when you
have been riding the rough side ol a
bumper for a few consecutive days that
sort of thing is liable to leave a marked
impression on your anatomy and impress
you with an appreciation of the fact that
a nights lodging and three squares a
day is the reward of industry

  then a fellow dismisses any petty-
larceny grudge he may have entertained
against work in general and gets busy
with the first job which  knocks unbid-
den  at the gate if there is anything
which brings home the satisfying dignity
of toil its the first pay-day after six
months on the hummer


the railroad mans magazine

   my railroad experience up to that time
consisted of just thirty days for thirty
dollars doing a mechanical adding stunt
in the paymasters office of the old mem-
phis road a position which i decided to
leave after i found out that they had left
my name off the pay-roll of course
that would hardly he considered a quali-
fication for a full-fledged stinger on any
road but a street-car line

i	hit the town

  but out there in arizona where a
switchman blows in draws a lantern and
a meal-book works three days and blows
out without the formality of returning
the lantern where the heat is so intense
that you keep looking around to see if
the man with the tail the horns and the
pitchfork is there where the chink wont
stand you up for a  t-bone where the
only thing that makes a loud noise is an
iron man from uncle sams mint its
work or dry up and blow away and as
i always was averse to a skinny anatomy
it was me to the toil

    and a stock-train arrived in the divi-
sion point one morning i dropped off
at the high switch and went down to the
water-tank and did a little wash-up stunt
turned my collar inside out and drifted
into the main portion of the town it
was one of those beautiful arizona towns
along the arizona in and out road with
a dark-brown complexion which leads
one to believe at first glance that one of
those xxxx brand sand-storms had ta-
ken sudden leave the day before and for-
got something on second glance you
see a wung chung laundry sign and you
know you are in the right pew

  after you have looked at it several
times you begin to love it with one of
those great generous loves which grows
greater and more generous in proportion
to the distance some liberal gringo
staked me to the price of a ham-and-egg
menu and after  had wrapped myself
carefully around it i was ready and
really felt equal to the task of looking
for a job

meets a freckled disposition

  the day before i broke into the quiet
life of the division terminal the natives

  had been treated to the excitement of a
fire which destroyed the mechanical de-
partment offices and the chief clerk was
holding forth in a box car i wandered
over that way determined to hit him for
a job as wiper in the roundhouse

   i	stepped into the car just as an ari-
zona zephyr deposited the southwest quar-
ter of the southeast half of the north
section of the indian reservation in my
left optic and for fully a minute after i
got inside  was excavating the real
estate for i knew that in my present
financial condition i couldnt waste any
money paying taxes

  over at the left of the car with a
brick-colored growth on his head sat a
young fellow who looked as if his dis-
position might be as freckled as his face
he was sitting on a barrel and was using
a dry-goods box for a desk he turned
around skilfully avoiding the tenpenny
nail and asked me what i wanted

   a job was my reply 

   fireman 

   never fired anything more compli-
cated than a gas-stove but ill take a shot
at most anything this morning

   dont hire anything but experienced
men and the remarks felt good in the
heat of the day they had such a beautiful
frosty ring to them

chalking lp  brownies

  i	ducked and came back strong with
a new lead and we finally got together
they were to carry me on the pay-roll as
a machinist helper but my heavy work
was to wear the point off a lead-pencil
chalking up the  brownies  for the
engineers who failed to make running
time with double tonnage or for firemen
who had had the poor form to allow the
passenger in the upper berth of the ten-
der to be seen by the traveling engineer

  m first job was sorting out and in-
dexing the personal record files which
had been dumped in disorder in a little
x galvanized-iron shed when the fire
was discovered i worked in that place
without ventilation for three hours that
first morning

   for three hours  toiled and sweated and
thought of the inviting shade under the
old apple-tree and decided a dozen times
over that i would give it the high sign
being a boomer brakeman



an unsympathetic chinese standing guard in the doorway of every bean garage

floor for the count and took me into the
box car

  after t had been meeting myself quite
regularly at the chinamans table for a
while the world began to look brighter
and i finally got so independent that i
walked right up to brick and asked him
how much real money i was to get for
this clerk job he informed me that if

  of course as the in and out never
overlooked a fraction i couldnt count
on that two-thirds of a cent then i
had to give up fifty cents out of that
check for the hospital fund and two dol-
lars for water rent a few other deduc-
tions brought the amount down to fifty
pesos

  i f i do say it myself i made good as a

and every time  remembered that it was
two hundred and eighty-six miles to al-
buquerque and eight hundred miles to
los angeles i reconsidered for walking
was bad and the stingers were hostile
owing to the fact that some double-cross
spotter had been over the division a few
days before and when lie left he took
about a dozen jobs along with him

  unless you had a fast-black recommen-
dation or the real card you couldnt ride
unless you had full fare i stuck and
brick the chief clerk took pity on me
just a few minutes before i went to the

 was real good and lived the month
through i would be credited on the pay-
roll with sixty-six dollars sixty-six and
two-thirds cents


the railroad mans magazine

clerk i could jack-up a fireman just as
hard as any other guy about the office
hand him out a regulation load of sar-
casm and give him just as picturesque a
spiel on the duties of a fireman as any
other clerk in the place who didnt know
the difference between a scoop and a
shaker-bar and who probably would
have to hesitate a minute to distinguish
between a small lump of gallup coal
and a compound liver pill

    got just as conceited as the general
run of clerks who get small pay with lots
of authority the only difference being
that  kept trying to back mine up with
a physical argument which often proved
hard on my eyes and at times kept me in
bed for a few days until the boss in-
formed me that  would have to tame
my disposition a little or search for other
fields of employment that decided
me

the real thing

  i had something like six bits in my
pocket and its surprising how indepen-
dent a fellow can be with all that money
to spend so  waited my opportunity and
decided that i would change jobs i
wanted to get into the transportation de-
partment of the road

   so  took a quiet trail after the  old
man caught him on a siding locked the
switch and tied into him head-on for a
job in his department i landed

   lust take it from me there are officials
and other officials but the old man
was an official he was there with about
six feet of length and four feet of cir-
cumference and if there is a job on any
railroad which he cant handle its un-
known to yours truly

  you can travel over the in and out
railroad and back again and you can
hear all kinds of stories about officials
but whenever you hear any one mention
 i l h the old man you will also
hear him add  and hes all the goods

    have seen these officials who get all
swelled up over the importance of their
position like a yellow pup that has par-
taken too freely of an arsenic wafer
then ive seen the kind who never for-
gets that he came up from the ranks but
when it came to being one of the men
you had to give it to the  old man

you simply had to pass him the striped
candy

  he could get mad-just as mad as any
one and his great neck would swell and
turn red like a turkey-gobblers but even
when he was mad you always knew he
was right and stood up and took your
medicine like a little man he knew his
business thats why he commanded the
respect of every man on the road from
the boomer switchman to old red-hot
frost who was the first conductor on the
road

  he always had time to listen to a griev-
ance and every fellow who went against
him found him square thats why lie is
general superintendent to-day and thats
why he will go higher than that before
they put him under the sod

  well me to the  old man  for a new
job  got it he referred me to his
chief clerk a large generous chunk of
anatomy who had most everything need-
ed in life except brains a fellow who
couldnt write on a typewriter without
stuttering and as  could out-talk him

i	landed

  they gave me a job as clerk to the
train-despatchers my boss was a nickels
worth of animal matter by the name of
dixon and he paid me seventy round
dollars a month to figure tonnage-sheets
and take care of the train-sheets and as
the job took a fellow with big feet and
little gray matter  made a success of it

in the new job

  ill have to give it to those train-
despatchers and ill hand over the bacon
to that fellow dixon as the wonder of
them all i dont care where you go
what the complications are surrounding
the job in all the world you will be
unable to find a position which carries
with it more responsibility than hangs
over the man who works a trick at a de-
spatched table on a busy division in a
busy season and be it said to their
credit as a class they are alive to the re-
sponsibility and taking all together
are as fine a set of men as ever followed
a nerve-trying occupation

  a despatcher is the whole works
around a railroad on his wits on his
brain on his ability to remember and
forget depend the success of the entire
being a boomer brakeman



i thought of the inviting shade
under the old apple-tree and
decided a dozen times over
that i would give it
the high sign

system anil the lives of both passengers
and crews

  hes the fall guy at that the big
squeeze makes the policy and he carries
it out on every move lie makes on eve-
ry tick of his instrument depend the
earnings of the road and the
lives of its patrons and em-
ployees

  he saves or makes overtime
he handles every detail of a
great system and when lie for-
gets- heaven help everybody

but he dont forget half the
wrecks which catch up with
trains and furnish copy for
newspapers result from the un-
written rules of the roads them-
selves

the movement of real estate was so brisk
that one could hardly see across the
street

  my old friend george robinson was
working the second trick that afternoon
he had his orders out and everything

  dont let any one tell you that a de-
spatcher has an easy take the wonder
is that four-fifths of them dont land in
the house with the upholstered walls for
the strain is something frightful and
just about one wreck in a lifetime is
enough to send a good man dippy i
never will forget the first wreck for
which i sat down and waited knowing
that just as sure as the world kept its
trolley on the wire and went on spinning
around for thirty minutes there would
be trouble of the real original brand

  it was one beautiful afternoon in july
-july is always a beautiful month in
arizona-i dont think sand-storms
galore and on this particular afternoon

was running along as smoothly as a well-
greased political machine

  regular  was on time coming west
and a double - header orange - train was
running extra east he had given the
extra east a positive ineet-order with 
at hulbrook and had the order out at
that station for 

the orange extra

  george was in the midst of a graphic
description of a fishing trip to clear
creek canon and the narration of that
time-worn story about the  biggest fish
which got away when hulbrook
 osed   by georges face went


	the railroad mans magazine

dixon began to laugh like an
idiot  gods mighty goqd
to his fools sometimes
was all he said

white he whirled around to that desk
and got busy on the key in mighty short
order

  he asked the operator at hulbrook if
the orange extra had showed up and he
replied that it had not he then asked
him if he had delivered the meet-order
to  and when the answer came over
the wire george just left his key open
and turned around	

  every operator and despatcher in the
office had read the conversation as it
came over the wire no one spoke for
a moment leorge turned back to his
train-sheet and ran his finger down the
column in which he was keeping s trip
anil up the column in which was the
orange extras figures saying nothing
and thinking-heaven only knows what

  perhaps he was thinking that riley
walcott one of the engineers was his
friend and neighbor-and perhaps he
wasnt while he stared at that train-
sheet that little fellow dixon was look-
ing at the ceiling and punishing a chew
of tobacco

   theyll meet on the curve just be-
yond the aztec cut he remarked  ex-
tra has a baldwin hog and a vauclain

saving the train

  then there was a click of the key-the
report of the disaster of course-and to
show just how uncertain is a certainty
the operator who had failed to deliver
that meet-order sent this over the wire
  is backing into the station-no harm
done and the strain broke dixon be-
gan to laugh like an idiot

   gods mighty good to his fools some-
times was all he said but a few min-

and  has a prairie type passenger-
engine and theyll be running like a bul-
let out of a gun

  then dixon got busy with the yard-
master the switch-engine ran down to
the hoodoo track coupled onto the
wrecking - train and backed down in
front of the despatchers office and
waited for orders

  fully a dozen men sat there in that
office and silently waited for a mix-up
that promised to be one of the worst
ever on a mountain division of a western
road say if i live to be a thousand
years old i will never live through such
a long twenty-seven minutes again
being a boomer brakeman

utes later he got that operator on the
wire and told him to take a long vaca-
tion- just as long as he wanted and then
ten years more

  j ust to show how close it was engi-
neer walcott who had been on  came
into the office after he had registered in
he had his usual smile set out on his
face didnt appear a bit nervous wasnt
sore at any one-just took the whole af-
fair as one of the risks of the game

  	didnt get me that time eh
george was his greeting and then he
told a few of the details

  he had failed to get the meet-order
at hulbrook and pulled out right on his
schedule as there were no stops be-
tween hulbrook and the terminal he was



swinging along at about thirty miles an
hour with thirty-five cars he hit the
aztec curve iust as a section foreman
came running out of the cut waving his
hat frantically

  knowing what he did about this game
of railroading he gave that string of
cars the big hole stopped and backed
up just as fast as he could the extra
poked the pilot of its first engine two car-
lengths over the spot where riley stopped
before backing up

  a section foreman had seen the trains
approaching had sent a mexican one
way and had dashed down the track the
other and his wits had saved several lives
and a good many thousand dollars worth
of rolling-stock

   in the november issue mr herr will tell how he went through the smoky end
of hi career and finally got on the salary-list as a full-fledged stinger

how a tunnel is bored

a mountain is worked through from opposite sides and in nearly
every instance the borers meet

tunnels are not pleasant to ride
through they are moreover fear-
fully expensive to construct and they neces-
sitate a double inspection but-and the
 but  in this case is a very large one-
they reduce grades and distances in whole-
sale fashion and so in a mountainous coun-
try the engineer must le prepared to drive
tunnels anti the folk who come after him to
operate them the tunnel job is apt to be a
separate part of the work it calls for its
own expert talent

  if the tunnel is more than a half or three-
quarters of a mile long it will probably be
dug from a shaft or shafts as well as from
its portals in this way the work will not
only be greatly hastened but the shafts will
continue in use after it is completed as vents
for the discharge of engine smoke and gases
from the tube

  the ordinary course of such work is by
the use of cutting shields proceeding simul-

taneously from the portals and from the
footings of the shafts these shields are to
be likened to steel rings of a circumference
only slightly greater than the finished tunnel

   men working on different levels of this
shield with pick and drill and dynamite
press forward and clear a path tracks fol-
low the cutting shield electric locomotives
are used whenever possible in removing the
material the use of electricity keeps the
tunnel quite clear of gases and makes the
safest light for the workers

   in rare cases the rock through which the
tunnel is bored is strong enough to support
itself but in most cases the engineers pre-
fer to line the bore with brick as a rule
and this lining is set in place right in the
path of the cutting shield after long
weeks and perhaps months of work the
-time comes when the different bores meet
and the tunnel is a single underground tube
from portal to portal

the lever is connected and this spring tends
normally to hold the plate so that it will
completely close the discharge end of the
hopper when it is desired to sand the
tracks the lever is so rocked as to slide the
plate against the tension of the spring this
brings the opening in the plate into registra-
tion with the discharge end of the hopper
thereby permitting sand to flow from the

hopper and through a flexible pipe which is
connected with the plate at the opening and
directs the discharged sand onto the tracks

 the advantage of this device lies in the
 fact that there is absolutely no chance of the
  plate becoming caught or failing to complete-
 ly close the discharge opening of the hopper
 

an economical frog

renewable point which saves the replace-
ment of the entire switch as
previously necessary

 a novel railroad track structure relat-
 ing to switches mates frogs and the
 like is covered in a patent no 
 june   issued to arthur j pemble-
 ton of cambridge massachusetts ordi-
 narily as is well known such structures
 comprise a foundation or body a point which
 is cast integral with the body and rail ex-
 tensions which are integral with the ends
 of the body and extend considerably there
 beyond

   in such structures however when the
 point becomes worn which happens long
 before the rail extensions begin to show
 wear the entire structure requires to be re-
 placed at considerable expense in the
 structure shown in the patent however that
 portion of the body upon which the point is
 formed is separate from the portions upon
 which the rail extensions arc formed and
 from which they project and the meeting
 ends of the several sections are formed with
 apertured lugs through which are passed
 bolts securing the several sections together

w lien the point of the structure becomes
worn so as to be useless only tihat section
upon which it is formed need be replaced

the bolts connecting the several sections
being removed for ibis purpose in such a
construction there will be a very consider-
able saving of material in making repairs

safe-coupling device

a projecting lever renders it unnecessary
for trainmen to go between

cars

with the object in view of eliminating
so far as possible the chances of ac-
cident to members of train crews in coupling
and uncoupling cars jesse m arthur and
john p birmingham both of lexington
virginia have devised a means whereby a
train of cars may be coupled or uncoupled
without the necessity of the members of the
train crew going between the cars

  in carrying out the invention there is em-
ployed the ordinary form of coupling head
and pin but a lever is pivotally mounted
upon the car across the end thereof and is
provided at one end with a handle which
projects slightly beyond one side of the car
the other or inner end of the lever is
formed with a hook which is engaged with
the eye at tihe upper end of the coupling pin

  by grasping the handle end of the lever
and without going between two cars the
lever may be rocked so as to withdraw or
insert the pin in the head a patent no
 june   has issued to the
inventors of this device

extension car-step

automatic action and convenient position
give chance for excellent
results

an extremely simple construction of ex-
tension step for railway passenger-
trains is evolved in an invention covered by
patent no  june   issued to
edward f howell of wapanucka okla-
homa

  while quite a few such steps have been
devised they are all raised and lowered
through the medium of hand or foot levers
which project up through the platform of the
car this is however undesirable in that
they are attended to by the members of the
train crew and this necessitates waste of
considerable time  the part of the crew
furthermore they arc liable to be acciden-
tally actuated by passengers and this might
result in the steps being lowered into the path
of some obstruction

  it is desirable to provide a step of this
character which can be readily actuated as
far as being lowered to extended position is
concerned by any passenger leaving the
train but which cannot be actuated except
by descending to the lowermost step of the
platform the structure disclosed in the
patent embodies a u-shaped hanger upon
which the extension step is secured the arms
or spaced portions of the hanger being
slidably mounted in suitable guides upon the
sides of the frame in which the stationary
steps are mounted

  from this it will be understood that the
hanger may be slid upwardly to position the
extensible step beneath the lowermost one
of the stationary steps or may be slid
downward so as to position the step for use
in ascending to or descending from the plat-
form a spring latch normally holds the
step in elevated position but is so con-
structed preferably that downward pres-
sure with one foot upon the extensible step
will lower it

torpedo in one piece

explosive in which the cap and the wrapper
cannot become soparated
in operation

it frequently happens that the ordinary
torpedoes now employed fail to explode
owing to the fact that the contents of the
wrapper or cap is lost due to splitting
or opening of the cap when engaged by the
car-wheels and in fact the torpedoes are
often thrown from the rails when not
squarely engaged by the wheels such tor-
pedoes are usually formed of a two-part
wrapper the parts being fitted together more
or less securely a torpedo and holder
therefor which embodies advantages over
those at present employed is disclosed in a
patent o  june   issued
to edward p s andrews of west wind-
ham new hampshire

  in carrying out the invention the ex-
plosive charge is placed in the mid portion
of a metallic tube and the end portions of
this tube are then flattened and folded under
the mid portion with the ends terminating
at the ends of the said mid portion contain-
ing the charge this tube is then placed
flat upon the central portion of a plate the
side edge portions of which are folded
down so as to adapt the plate for disposal
upon the tread of a rail

  the plate is formed at its end edges with
tongues which are bent up and engage with
the ends of the mid portion of the tube and
serve to hold it securely in its folded posi-


the railroad mans magazine

lion and against displacement in any direc-
tion inasmuch as the tube when properly
folded and arranged in the holder is held
longitudinally of the rail upon which the
holder is disposed the car wheels passing
over the tube will so act as to more tightly
fold the tube and thereby prevent spilling

new idea in rail braces

an invention that prevents the creeping
as well as the spreading of rails
to which it is fitted

the ordinary rail braces now employed
while they are in most instances effec-
tive in preventing spreading of the rails
do not prevent creeping a rail brace struc-
ture protected by patent no  june
  issued to michael p bardon of
guernsey california attains both of these
objects

  liach of the brace structures covered in
the patent consists of a set of three rods
two of which are disposed diagonally be-
tween the rails to be braced and the third
transversely at right angles between the
rails midway of their ends these rods in-
tersect and a bolt is passed through them at
this point to secure them together

  each end of each of the rods is engaged
through an opening formed in the web of
the adjacent rail and nuts are threaded
upon the ends of the rods to secure them to
the rails it will be understood that the
transverse rods serve to prevent spreading of
the rails and that the diagonally disposed
rods serve to prevent creeping as well as
cooperating to prevent spreading

trip-lever for air brake

system which will act as check on engi-
neer setting brakes when danger
signal is ignored

a novelty in air-brake systems is dis-
closed in a patent no  june
  issued to john w sharp of chi-
cago illinois it is the primary object of
the system to provide means for maintain-
ing a double check  the engine crew as
regards the observance of signals at stations
and block-liouses in carrying out the in-
vention the cars of the train are equipped
with the usual train pipe and brake cylin-
ders and the train pipe is provided with a
branch in which is arranged a valve having
an operating or trip lever connected with
its plug this lever is so positioned as to

be engageable by trip devices which are ar-
ranged at the stations or block-houses and
are set in operative position when the dan-
ger-signals are displayed

  should the engineer of the train fail to
heed the danger-signals at any station and
run his train past the station the triji de-
vices will engage with the valve lever
mentioned and will open the valve thereby
setting the brakes and automatically bring-
ing the train to a stop the other means
embodied in the system for keeping check on
the locomotive crew is embodied in a valve
which is interposed in another branch of the
train pipe and which is adapted to he
operated by any one of the train crew who
happens to observe that the engineer has
passed a danger-signal this emergency
valve is provided for the event of the first
described brake-setting failing to work or
in case any member of the crew happens to
observe some track or other conditions
which warrant the stopping of the train

 convenient car-stop

patent covering or device which is easy
to apply and dismount and does
not damage track

the ordinary form of car-stop of that
class which is secured upon a rail anil
against which the wheels of the car to be
held rest is embodied in a block which is
to be bolted or otherwise clamped in place
upon the rail where such stops are to be
used only for a short time considerable
time is lost in applying and removing them
and for this reason it is desirable that a stop
be employed which can be readily and quick-
ly secured upon or removed from the rail

  the only ones possessing this advantage
which have been so far devised have been
constructed to fit over the rail and engage
with the ties but injury to the ties has re-
sulted from their employment however in
a parent no  june   issued
to robert e davies of st joseph mis-
souri there is shown a car-stop which will
fulfil these conditions

  the stop mentioned consists of a block
which is recessed to lit against one side of
the rail and also over the tread or ball of
the rail and against which the wheels of the
car are to be held to this block is pivoted
the headed end of a lever which headed
end is of cam formation and firmly
clamps the block against the rail when the
lever is swung down to position beside the
rail when it is desired to remove the stop
from the rail it is only necessary to swing
the lever in an upward direction

kitten carrolls book-
learning

by keene abbott

             it was good enough anyhow to save
             the lives of four hundred people

im car roll the bridge
watchman had trouble with
liis left eye often he ex-
plained to his wife that his
right one  got all fogged up
when he was only a boy and
as for the other-well she used to de-
clare that  too much readin matter was
what ailed jim which only shows
prejudice on her part for jim held
stoutly to the notion that part of a sand-
burr had  biowed into his good lamp
however that may be it is a fact that
he was a great reader often his wife
made such a fuss about it especially
when he could not be taken from his
book to bring in coal or chop kindling
that he would have to soothe her by say-
ing now kitten dont you take on
like that readin is good for a body
its great to brace up the clia-ra--ter of
a man

  although she had rather outgrown

that pet name of hers-for she was big
both east and west and her north and
south dimensions were also rather plump
-it is true that  kitten  still remained
a very good word for jim to use in get-
ting arouncl her

  ordinarily she was not averse to his
reading it was really remarkable how
she had got used to it and that she her-
self had also learned to read a little
the event of her day during the first
years of their married life was her noon-
time visits to her husband at the bridge
when she would take him his luncheon
and sit with him inside the watchmans
box a little red house so small that it
reminded one of a noahs ark

  after he had eaten the contents of the
tin pail and drunk the bottle of coffee
to the last drop the next thing was for
him to get out his black shiny pipe and
blow into the mouthpiece his red
bristly checks would puff out like the


the railroad mans magazine

face of a cornet-player in a brass band
and sometimes he would hold the
charred bowl to the window shut one
eye clamp the tip of his tongue between
his teeth and try to see what was the
matter with the stem that it would not
draw

  when he had at length smoked his
pipeful to settle his dinner he would
bring out a cinnamon-colored book from
his bulging pocket clear his throat as
he opened the volume and prepare to
read

  it must be admitted that jim was not
a very good reader li is voice rose and
fell in a monotonous sing-song and he
stumbled on many words sometimes
kitten sitting by the stove with the baby
wrapped in a brown shawl would fall
asleep and then he would speak severe-
ly to her

   rate look here now is that a
nice way to do i read you a story-
a good story-but what is the use of it
you go to roost just like a hen you
dont hear anything my mouth gets
dried up with reading to you my eye
gets tired and then you-shame on you
woman -you go to sleep

  sometimes  do yes thats so jim
but not this time this time i was only
thinkin with my eyes shut

   did you hear me

   not zacly-not all the while no

i was thinkin of us and how we live
she put the baby into his arms leaned
forward and rested her cheek upon his
knee  i get to wonderin sometimes
why you ever took up with me what
a queer man me jest a common dance-
liall girl and yet you used to talk to
me jest like you was my brother or
father

   it was downright amazin what a
good man you was i thought you would
soon be gettin tired of me but you
dont you read to me and talk to me
and yet i am just like a child for not
knowing much

  well whats that to make a row
about he inquired and he pinched
her cheek and slapped her on the arm
to let her know that she was very dear
and necessary to him

  dont you see what im thinkin
she went on  how will it be when
our little boy grows up and finds out

what a foolish mother he has now
if i could only read and write a little
maybe he wouldnt ever get ashamed
of me

  what silly talk that is he pro-
tested  you ought to know that book-
learnin dont count for much its
cha-nrc-ter that counts look at abe
lincoln he wasnt much punkins on
book-learnin it was the big heart in
him and the nobleness of him that count-
ed most

  after this lecture of his the woman
took the baby again and the reading was
resumed inspired by the notion that
his wife considered him such a man as
abraham lincoln jim put more life into
his voice made the sentences have more
meaning as though the people of the
book were actually talking as people do
in real life

  sometimes he looked up from the
printed page and noted how intently she
was watching him how full of interest
were her moist blue eyes her red lips
revealed her white teeth her arms
pressed the baby tight against her
breast and presently when he closed the
book at the end of a chapter she sighed
and shook her head and wiped the tears
away with the back of her hand

  in a hoarse whisper she presently
asked

  that aint all is it

  no there was more

  and he would read it to her

  not now-some other time

  for a while she said nothing more
but presently she opened her lips start-
ed to say something but did not speak
she sighed deeply blinked and her
plump dimpled chin continued to
quiver

   how real it is all that  she whis-
pered sidney carton he is going
to have his head cut off and nobody
stops him and that little girl she
doesnt even know why she is going to
be killed what bad bad people to act
like that toward a little girl worse
than wild indians but he holds her
hand and talks nice to her and then
they keep on going to the scaffold he
is a kind man and yet it-it makes me
sort of sicklike and ashamed to hear
that why do i want to hear it its
so real and awful and hurts so that i
kitten carrolls book-learning	

dont know at all what makes me want
to hear it

  you dont know well its very
simple you see now-the turribleness
you see aint just for the sake of being
turrible sidney carton was a good man
wasnt he all right then the good-
ness of his cha-rw-ter had to come out
hesitatingly the woman inquired

   but aint it lies all that

   well look here now you dont
think a nice colored-up picture is a lie
do you course not sure you dont

nursery jingles she began to teach them
verses that would be good for the
cha-rac-ter jamie at the age ol nine
as he stood on the table in the watch-
mans little home near the bridge would
send his father and mother into raptures
by reciting to them the metrical nar-
rative about the mississippi river pilot
who saved everybody on board the burn-
ing steamboat by holding

 her nozzle agin the bank till the last
 galoots ashore

so you see its the same about a good
story if it looks just like the real
thing and has nobleness in it why then
its all right and agreeable now me
when  read a story like this one it gets
a hold of me

  the woman deeply pondered what her
husband had said and from that day she
struggled harder than ever under his
patient guidance to learn how to read
and write in order that she might have
the respect of her children as they
grew up

  when the little boy and little girl
finally reached the age for memorizing

look at abe lincoln
he wasnt much
punkins on book-
learnin

  it was in the winter of  that
jims eye went back on him inflam-
mation had set in and he was finally
tsbliged to surrender his post to his
father a veteran of the civil war and
an indian fighter who did valiant serv-
ice against the hostile sioux

  in february when some union pa-
cific officials and engineers were down
to inspect the bridge and the condition
of the river it was of course impossible
to keep the watchman at home in a dark-
ened room although his eye was very
painful and had swollen almost shut a
season of anxiety had come to him-


the railroad mans magazine

anxiety about the bridge it had been
a hard winter and the river had never
before been so solidly frozen then
suddenly warm weather had set in
for two weeks balmy winds blew across
the prairie snows vanished grass be-
gan to grow

  into the broad missouri hurled the
ice-choked waters of many streams
from bank to bank spread the wash and
clamorous voicings of the llood higher
from day to day higher still and ever
more ferociously swift tumbled the gur-
gling waters beneath the bridge

   it was never like this before car-
roll told the officials of the company
but the chief engineer he who had
planned and superintended the construc-
tion of the bridge complacently shrugged
his shoulders

   what of it he asked  out yon-
der is a mass of stone and steel that
nothing can jar loose his opinion
was shared by other builders by the
division superintendent and by the vice-
president of the corporation perfectly
safe all believed that-all but jim
carroll the watchman

   its not the water-its the ice un-
der the water that scares me  he an-
nounced and gravely wagged his head
as he lifted the white bandage off his
red and swollen eye in an almost futile
effort to see how the river was behaving
stare as he might he could observe only
a wet gray blur but the others noticed
how the current was split by the massive
piers and turned back in frothing fur-
rows on either side of every ponderous
shoulder of solid rock

  all that day and all that night car-
roll did not leave the bridge and
whether it was his father or bis wife
who kept watch with him he persisted
in asking a multitude of questions how
much higher had the water risen did
they think the ice would go out with
a rush or would it melt gradually
were they sure they did not hear it
cracking did they think it safe for
the trains to keep on crossing the bridge

  when he had been forty hours with-
out sleep his wife at last prevailed upon
him to go home even then he might
not have yielded to her entreaties if his
inflamed eye had not swollen shut it
was so very painful that finally lie suf-

fered himself to lie led away and once
in the house he ate a little drank some
hot coffee and then without taking off
his clothes lay down on the bed

   almost instantly carroll fell into a
trance-like sleep suddenly a muffled
explosion roused him then came an-
other and still another they were ter-
rific shocks there seemed to be a rip-
ping in the bowels of the earth it was
as though some enormous incalculable
power were trying to cleave the world
in two

  the house shook the wailing wind
fumbled and shuffled at the door the
man tried to open his swollen eye but
he could not he called and no one
answered he leaped from bed knocked
against the furniture felt himself
walled in by an abyss of darkness

  was it night he smelled the pene-
trating reek of a kerosene-lamp but
what time of night he listened for
the ticking of the clock as he heard
nothing he knew that it had stopped
the quaking of the house might have
done that-but why had his watch also
stopped he fumbled the time-piece
from his pocket held it to his ear shook
it he heard nothing well then he
must have slept long very long so long
that his watch had run down

  but why did no one answer him
again he called and again the house
was dumb with a terrifying silence in
which the wind cried aloud and the
windows jarred and the doors shook in
utter loneliness

  presently some one came in there
was a gallop of little feet on the floor-
feet that abruptly halted

   that you tamie carroll asked

    yes pa

  well boy he waited for a re-
ply but as the child did not answer
him he repeated rapidlv the one word
 well-well-well  

    its down said the boy

  hey whats that

   the bridge-

    gone is it i knew it i said so
i said it would what time is it an-
swer cant you quick tell me now
daytime or nighttime wheres your
mother is your granpap- what
time is it

   the boy gasped with fright and said
kitten carrolls

book - learning



 he said-granpap said-he said to
ma-

  well out with it dont stand there
 like that

the boy became more confused
speech had been frightened out of him

come jamie come now tell
daddy what granpap said

  two hours and a half he said-
 not quite two hours and a half till train-
 time

  two hours eh  two hours and a
 half  carroll exclaimed and began

it was daytime he wouldnt have to go
but nighttime you see and so you
see he has to keep the train from run-
ning off into the river

 in the fever of his exultation his voice
suddenly stopped short the door had
opened a cold gust swept in and with
it came the noise of footsteps the heavy
clumping of boots upon the iloor

  the little boy slipped from his fathers
arms the man opened his mouth to
speak but could not do so his father
was there before him carrolls face

the man opened
his mouth to
speak but
could
not

beating his hands against his legs
 time enough  good my boy  plenty
of time to stop the train hell do it
jamie come here you little rat

  the father caught the child in his
arms laughed kissed the little boy re-
peatedly slapped him on the back and
continued to talk disjointedly

   a brave man your grandfather
 wful dangerous work hes crossing
the river on the ice and its night-
awful dark i expect he jumps from
one cake to another maybe he falls into
the water well but he can swim good
he gets out again hell make it if

had shifted expression there was an
interval of perspiring pallor as though
his whole body were sickened over with
the ash and tallow of gray terror

what-whats to be done said the
man who had come in he set his lan-
tern down then took it up then nerv-
ously set it down again

 with dry articulation carroll said

 you-you didnt go

 go where 

 with an empty colorless voice car-
 roll added

two hours and a half - plenty of
time-and he didnt go


the railroad mans magazine

  suddenly the watchman tore the band-
age from his eye then with his fin-
gers he squeezed open the swollen lid
with terrifying scrutiny he stared at
his father and straightway the elderly
man became interested in the muddy toe
of his boot the bristling end of his
gray mustache twitched against his leath-
ery cheek as with an air of bravado he
suddenly threw up his head

   no i didnt drown myself not
me  he exclaimed  i may be crazy
but i aint no such jackass as that

  with choking hoarseness in his voice
carroll said

  he didnt do it jamie he didnt
go a soldier a brave man but he
wont do this thing jamie not him
out of my house put down that lan-
tern  get out 

  as the man made no movement and
stood there in a stupor of amazement
carroll fumbled on the stove-hearth for
the iron poker caught it up and jerked
back his arm as if to hurl the missile
then slowly he relinquished it-let it
drop on the floor  with quick determi-
nation he called his son jamie come
here give me your hand

  the child was too much stricken with
terror to advance and again his father
called him

   what-you too  are you afraid 
will nobody help a coaxing tone
came into the mans voice as he added
 come jamie  theres a good boy give
me your hand

  the child winced with pain as his
fathers strong fist gripped the wee fin-
gers the boy tried to pull back but
the man jerked him close  now ja-
mie grab up that lantern take me to
the river

  the boy fell to crying and dropped
on his knees  i cant he whimpered
and the man gave the small arm a cruel
wrench

   come none of that get up  do
as i tell you  

  it is strange what courage there may
be in such a little boy commonly an
obedient child jamie this time could not
be cowed into obedience he called his
mother at the pitch of his shrill voice
he screamed for her to come

  as the man put a heavy hand over the
childs mouth he said

  get up you little fool none of
that shes not here i called her and
she didnt come

   yes she is-she is too in the house 
she was all tired out she went to bed
right after supper shell come have
her take you to the river

   then wake her get her up  car-
roll exclaimed he had scarcely re-
leased the childs hand when the outside
door again opened this time to admit a
small woman of seven with wisps of
tawny hair flying about her pale face and
her eyes all red with crying

  run jamie she panted   ma
says to hurry with the lantern

  you rose is it you her father
asked wheres your mother

   out there the child moistly replied
with parched articulation the father
repeated the words

  out-out there his mouth quiv-
ered and he knocked his heavy fists
against his temples then seizing his
head by the hair he rocked it violently
back and forth

  in his anguish of despair he said al-
most quietly  she got rid of you she
sent you away the lantern was an ex-
cuse to get you away from her you lied
to me jamie you said your mother
was here in the house mother you
have no mother jamie shes gone
she thought i couldnt see how to cross
the river on the ice she went were
alone children shes gone away from
us

  he was convinced of this he was
thoroughly and terribly convinced and
yet he fought against believing it with
the children leading him the three went
forth into the night and called and
cried aloud to the woman who was gone
from them the wailing of the wind
out of the darkness replied to their
shouts and to the sobbing of little chil-
dren the wet-lipped laughter of the rush-
ing river gave forth its gurgling answer

  the spectral light of the new day dis-
closed a breech an ugly wound in the
landscape the icy teeth of the river
had gnawed the bridge away broken it
wrenched it torn it down on the
maha side of the gray-and-yellow flood
the mangled wreckage remained to tell
of the terrific force that had been at
work submerged telegraph wires slant-
kitten car rolls book-learn inc



ing up from the water to the bank kept
jerking and vibrating like harp-strings
the broken back of the bridge sloping
down into the current but still held to-
gether by the railway tracks continued
to pulsate and groan with the ramming
and battering of the ice cakes

  in the distance to the north the gray
even field of the river was mar-
bled with yellow streaks showing
the disintegration of ice which
came floating and herding on
down-stream making the twisted
iron rods of the bridge heave and
clank and chatter as the frozen
blocks successively knocked them-
selves against the wreckage

  the coming of the dawn
brought no relief to the car-
rolls and worst of all to bear was
the uncertainty abashed and
taciturn the grandfather had
joined the watchers by the bridge

from the house he had brought
a pair of field-glasses and as
the day advanced he could make
out that a red flag a dan-
ger-signal was fluttering
on the remaining part
of the bridge  the op-
posite shore

   well the train didnt
go down thats sure
he said

  almost timidly the
watchman asked

   did she could she
do you think-

  out of pity for his son
the old man replied 

   maybe so maybe she
stopped the train

   you say that but
you- how could that
be possible when she couldnt swim 
if you had known what she was going
to do you would have stopped her
wouldnt you you wouldnt let her do
that thing she sent the children away
she kissed rose and rose cried because
her mother was crying you see how it
has turned out well engineers are al-
ways careful when the water is high
they stopped the train it was needless
for her to try to warn them that the
bridge was down

   yes thats so quite needless

  what you can say that it was
not she had to go well and she did
it and theres an end of it only i do
hope we can get the body back

  as the day wore on some officials of
the railway company came down to the
river to inspect the damage that the ice
had wrought and when they heard of

with the children leading him
the three went forth
into the night

the railroad mans watch

by h f mfddrl

have you ever noticed an engineer a conductor or a brakeman take
one of these big silver-cased watches from his pocket and look at it
just as if it were a human being to the railroad man a watch is
almost human for it is the one thing in which he must place the most abso-
lute reliance

      it is the only  tool  that he is obliged to purchase with his own
money-everything else is paid for by his employers but the manner in
which it is regulated cleaned and kept in order for him makes a story of
unwaning interest

constant care is taken to keep this the greatest of all railroad
safeguards from gaining or losing the fraction
of a second

ne of the most important of
the safeguards in railroad-
ing is the railroad mans
watch in classifying a
watch as a railroad safety
appliance there is this
distinction to be made that while all
other safety devices are procured at the
expense of the railroad companies the
watch must be purchased by the en-
gineer conductor or brakeman the
railroad employees however see no par-
ticular reason for objecting to this in-
vestment partly because their well-paid
position calls for no equipment of tools
and partly because a good watch is a
permanent necessity in their calling

  few of the vast army of travelers are
aware of the rigid system in force ia re-
gard to the timepieces of the employees
-their grade regulation and repair a
watch inspection system or  time serv-
ice is now in force on a great ma-

jority of the railroads in accordance
with the inspection rules a railroad man
is compelled to purchase a watch of high
grade the minimum standard being
what is known among american manu-
facturers as the seventeen-jeweled patent
regulator adjusted to temperature iso-
chronism and live positions

must buy a good watch

  while this is not by any means the
most expensive watch produced in
american factories it has all the essen-
tials necessary to good timekeeping and
first-class service the  time service 
calls for a watch that will run within
a variation of thirty seconds a week and
the watch above specified with proper
attention will accomplish this and more
the rules also call for a lever-set watch
in preference to a pendant set as the
former is less liable to get out of order


the railroad mans magazine

the setting device being hidden away and
less liable to be interfered with than the
pendant setting

the time inspectors duties

  the inspection system calls for the
service of a general time inspector and
a staff of local -inspectors the latter
situated at such points on the road as
will make it convenient for the men to
have their watches attended to in accord-
ance with the rules these inspectors
are of course expert watch - repairers
and are generally selected from such
local jewelers as are known to possess
special competency in this line

  the railroad man having provided
himself with a watch of the specified
grade is compelled by the rules to sub-
mit this timepiece once every two weeks
to a local inspector for regulation by
comparison with a standard clock

  this bimonthly examination of the
timepiece by the inspector is most pains-
taking he notes whether it calls for
cleaning or mere regulation and a com-
plete record is kept of the rate of the
watch the date of regulation or repair
the number of seconds gained or lost
since its last inspection the name of the
owner and other particulars

  this bimonthly examination of the
card which he carries on his person and
on which the inspector marks the rate
of the watch after each inspection
affords a convenient means of compar-
ing the rate of the watch at different
times and its improvement or deteriora-
tion in this respect in addition to the
record which the inspector keeps for
himself he has to furnish the general
time-inspector with similar information
together with any personal report which
he wishes to make

  it is the duty of the time-inspector
to make note of such as may not submit
their watches regularly for inspection or
whose watches are showing imperfect
service prompt action is taken in all
such cases to discipline the delinquents
and enforce obedience to the rules

  it should be stated that the railroad
man is not compelled to purchase his
timepiece in any particular place or from
any particular jeweler or manufacturer
the watch can be purchased anywhere

provided it is of the specified grade and
meets with the approval of the local in-
spector neither is the railroad man com-
pelled to give his watch for repair to any
particular jeweler or watch-inspector

  he can have the timepiece repaired by
whomsoever he wishes the only stipula-
tion being that it be submitted for the
approval of the inspector before it is
again put into use this is necessary to
the thoroughness of the system

system of loaning watches

  another interesting feature of the
time system is the loaning of watches to
the men while their own are being re-
paired the watch thus loaned must
of course be similar to that left for
repair as the companies can take no
chances on any imperfect timekeeper
under the system of watch - inspection
which is generally regarded as the most
perfect now in use the inspectors are
furnished with standard railroad watches
in nickel cases which they are free to
loan to the railroad men while their own
are being repaired the loaned watch
must be strictly up to the requirements
laid down in the rules

  as the railroad  time service  speci-
fies a standard for all watches it is to
the interest of the various watch com-
panies to produce a grade which cor-
responds exactly to this standard the
railroad man is free to purchase any
make he chooses provided it is up to
this standard there is absolutely no
discrimination as is sometimes charged
and the best interests of the railroad
men are carefully looked after

five thousand inspected

  some idea of the number and value of
the watches used on the railroads may be
had from the reports furnished by the
chief inspector for instance on the
new york central lines alone a total
of about five thousand watches were
regularly inspected last year and if we
calculate the value of these watches at
an average of twenty-five dollars which
is somewhat low it will be seen that
on this railroad the system calls for an
investment of one hundred and twenty-
five thousand dollars
the railroad mans watch



  this is not taking into account the
standard watches loaned to the men
when their own are being repaired nor
the system of standard clocks which is
also an essential of the  time service
the watch-inspection system is long
past the experimental stage and has
proved its full value both to the rail-
road companies and to the men there
is no record of any railroad having dis-
pensed with the system once it is in-
stalled and doubtless the time is not far
distant when some form of  time serv-
ice  will be made compulsory on rail-
roads

  an interesting result of the system is
the great pride taken by the railroad
men in the time-keeping performance of
the watches it is quite customary to
see these men comparing their time
records and engaging in friendly dispu-
tation over the achievements of their
watches on time-keeping this spirit
appeals most favorably to the railroad
companies and it also strikes a respon-
sive cord in the traveling public who
have come to regard the railroad watch
as a factor in their safety and the
only unerring authority on  the exact
time

big shipment of buffaloes

the canadian northern carries  head in a special train of 

cars a distance of  miles

universal anti exceptional was the
freight train of the canadian north-
ern railway that left lamont for wain-
wright alberta one clay this summer
laden with three hundred and forty-seven
of the wildest buffaloes of the plains to lie
shipped to new pastures in the rich northern
prairie lands

  the train was made up of twenty-three
of the best appointed stock cars fitted with
feed and water-troughs especially built in
the cars for the journey each car was ar-
ranged with separate stalls for the buffaloes
had to make a trip of three hundred and
fifteen miles to a place where conditions
more consistent with their nature-such as
pasturage and shelter-are to be had and
where it is expected that the benefits derived
from a milder climate will prolong the lives
and increase the herd

  this consignment was only part of a herd
bought by the canadian government from
michael pable an indian breeder in mon-
tana who with singular foresight herded
together about twenty-five years ago some
twenty-five of the animals

  the herd was bought in a lot which was
conservatively said to contain four hundred
head the price paid was about two hun-
dred and fifty thousand dollars when
the last buffalo is lassoed and conquered
preparatory to being loaded and shipped to
his new home the herd will number about
seven hundred

  the shipment meant an astonishing

amount of hard and dangerous work the
animals are wild and their powers of en-
durance are marvelous the horses used
are reenforced many times before a single
buffalo is safely penned the cowboys are
experts in their line and when their work
is completed each should come in for a
benefit from the hero fund

  the train-load of animals was in charge
of howard douglass who was assisted by
nine typical cowboys in whose physique
could be discerned the healthful glow the
agile graceful step the piercing cautious
eye so strongly developed in men of their
calling

  the canadian northern handled the ani-
mals with great care because each buffalo
had to be pulled onto a car and separately
stalled it took three days to get the entire
consignment aboard no effort at record-
breaking speed was attempted but right of
way was accorded the train in all cases
feed and watering facilities were had in the
terminal yard at saskatoon where superin-
tendent s s foley and chief clerk barry
and their assistants looked after every de-
tail that meant comfort for the animals
watering and feeding was done without
unloading

  two of the buffaloes died en route one a
small calf too young for the strenuous jour-
ney  the other a three-year-old cow that
died from a bursted blood vessel due to her
wild attempts for freedom each buffalo
is said to be worth one thousand dollars

can you answer this one

is a fortunate magazine whose readers can anticipate the re-
llii quests of the editor whether it is that this magazine is in
such close contact with its readers that the wishes of the
readers and the wishes of the editor are apt to be the same
 we do not know but this seems a likely solution

last month we expressed a wish to have our readers send

	some puzzles in response to a request that we continue the puzzle de-
partment before we could get the request in type along came mr
charles g cook of newport rhode island with the following little
mystery mr cook does not give us his postal address but if he will
send us his own solution of it we will hold it as die authoritative one as
is our custom

    sound as we all know travels at a velocity of about one thousand
one hundred feet per second let us assume that it lakes just five seconds
to travel one mile a train standing two miles away  a track blows
the whistle it will take the sound about ten seconds to reach us

let us suppose that we are standing at a certain spot along a railroad
track a train is approaching us traveling at the rate of a mile a minute

    at a point exactly two miles away from us the engineer pulls the
whistle-cord and holds it down for two minutes or until the train
reaches us we see the steam coming out of the whistle when the cord
is pulled but do not hear the sound of the whistle for about ten seconds
when the train is opposite us the engineer releases the cord

    the whistle has been blowing for two minutes but we hear the sound
for only one minute and about fifty seconds if the conditions are re-
versed the train going in the opposite direction and the whistle blown
for two minutes we hear the sound for two minutes and ten seconds

    question what becomes of the ten seconds of noise in the first
case and where does the ten seconds of noise come from in the second
case

 by edgar welton cooley

       how the obstacles of fate prevented james junkins
       jentz from keeping an engagement with cupid

fames junkins jentz turned
softly on his swivel-chair and
glanced suspiciously at the ac-
countants at work at their

           a deep furrow creased his
forehead between his brows his eyes
traveled restlessly from one to another
of his employees and hishead was bent
a trifle forward as though he was anx-
ious to catch any whispered comment
that might be made

  but knowledge of his intense gaze was
not made manifest by any of his subordi-
nates  neither word nor sign betrayed
any suspicion on the part of any one
wherefore mr james junkins jentz
having satisfied himself that there was no
eye to witness what he might do turned
softly back to his desk carefully unlocked
a small drawer in front of him and took
therefrom a letter

   the letter was enclosed in an envelope
but the envelope was not of that appear-
ance which characterizes business station-
ery it was square in shape and pale blue
in color and the single sheet which it
enclosed was of the same tint the
writing was unmistakably feminine to
paper and envelope clung the faint scent
of heliotrope

   mr jentz unfolded the letter quietly
a bright glitter illumined his eyes his
lips parted in a smile

   the epistle had been in the possession
of mr jentz for ten days and during
that time he had read it many times and
its every word was perfectly familiar
to him

   but he read it again partly lecause it
was a new experience to mr jentz and
partly because he wished to assure himself
that nothing not even the most trivial

bit of information should escape his
memory

    it will be glorious it ran  to fool
my friends none of them so far as i
know even suspects our engagement if
you are careful dear no one need know
of your presence in arlington you
should arrive on the local at two-twenty
in the afternoon we can be married in
the presence of only my immediate fam-
ily at six oclock and quietly take the
eight-ten train for the east

  when mr jentz had read thus far he
carefully refolded the letter replaced it
in the envelope and slipped it into his
pocket then he turned once more in
his chair and regarded with renewed
suspicion the clerks in the other room

  but as even the office-boy at that mo-
ment deep in the allurements of a dime-
novel bestowed upon mr jentz not so
much as a single glance he drew a deep
breath of relief and looked at his watch
it was  and his train was to leave in
an hour

  mr jentz arose from his chair in a
very casual and indifferent manner he
struggled heroically to conceal from vul-
gar gaze or prying eyes the trepidation
that suddenly had seized him

  he softly closed the roll-top of his
desk put his hat on in the most careless
manner passed into the hall walked
slowly and deliberately to the elevator
and was soon out upon the street

  but once clear of the office-building
mr jentz hailed a cab and was driven
rapidly to his hotel without waiting to
take the elevator he hurried up two flights
of stairs to his apartments grabbed his
carefully packed suit-case rushed down
again climbed into the cab and was
whirled away toward the railway station
	the railroad

  upon entering the waiting-room he
glanced uneasily about to make sure that
nobody in the crowd recognized him
beholding no familiar countenance he
strode boldly to the ticket-window and
purchased a ticket for arlington

  making his way through the gate like
a culprit eluding the law mr jentz
sought an inconspicuous seat in a coach
pulled his hat well over his eyes and al-
most shivered with apprehension until
the train started

  but once beyond the town limits he
drew another long breath of relief raised
himself to his full height and began to
mentally review what would be expected
of him when he should reach his desti-
nation

  he wondered what the boys at the
office would say when they heard tht he
had slipped away to marry the thought
brought a broad grin to his face

  but one disturbing thought one poign-
ant fear intruded itself upon mr jentzs
meditations there were but ten min-
utes for connections at arlington junc-
tion suppose something should occur
to delay his train and he should fail to
catch the local on the other road

  the mere supposition made him ner-
vous so nervous that presently when a
series of short shrill blasts of the whistle
was followed by a -severe jarring and
jolting that nearly threw him from his
seat he grew excited

   heavens   he gasped when the train
came to a stop  were off the track 

  he threw up a window and through
the narrow opening he thrust his fat face
and broad shoulders as far as possible

  at a road-crossing a herd of cattle was
on the track a fanners boy was using
his utmost to drive them off the right of
way but they had become entirely un-
manageable

  a brakeman standing upon the front
platform of the forward coach swearing
vigorously added much to the confusion
that prevailed

  as the moments passed mr jentz
manifested many evidences of impatience
he glanced repeatedly at his watch
thrust his head out the window only to
draw it in again cast frequent indignant
glances at a timid little man across the
aisle as though he was to blame for the
delay and mumbled incoherently

mans magazine

  but the impatience of mr jentz in-
tense though it was was not potent to
clear the track so finally arising and
making his way to the platform of his
car he addressed the conductor stand-
ing beside the train

   why he demanded in a loud and
rather boisterous voice  doesnt that boy
get those cattle out of the way 

   i dont know replied the conductor
struggling to keep his own temper under
control

  you dont know james junkins
jentz regarded the conductor with un-
disguised contempt  why dont you
know isnt it your business to know

   i dont think so responded the con-
ductor heroically calm and unruffled
 i dont believe there is anything in the
book of rules which requires a conductor
to know why a cow or any number of
cows persist in going in every direction
but the one in which you wish them to
go

   i dont suppose there is snapped
mr jentz who was not in a pleasant
mood in the excited condition of his
mind the delay seemed of unusual dura-
tion and he was growing decidedly anx-
ious regarding that connection at arling-
ton junction

   but i had thought that conductors
were required to use every effort to get
their trains through on time that they
were not supposed to sit down and wait
until some blamed brindle bovine makes
up its mind to get off the track

  it would seem to me-mr jentz
inserted his thumbs beneath his suspend-
ers and glared crushingly at the con-
ductor  that passengers who have paid
their fare and are anxious to reach junc-
tion points in time to catch connecting
trains have as many rights as any
freckle-faced boy that deliberately drives
his cattle in front of a train

   if i were you advised the conduc-
tor consolingly  id go and sit down

i	should try to keep cool it is a very
warm day and one should avoid getting
unduly excited

  mr jentz drew in his breath violently
opened and closed his fingers spasmodic-
ally and puffed out his cheeks but he
did not speak

  for the moment words adequate to do
his feelings justice failed to manifest
the two-twenty local



themselves to his agitated mind when
finally his accumulated indignation was
just about to relieve itself by verbal ut-
terance the conductor shouted all
aboard 

   mr jentz returned to his seat but he
did not keep cool his face grew pur-
ple and he shifted his legs from one knee
to the other with nervous frequency

  his agitation accentuated by the re-
marks of the conductor increased rather
than diminished and he was very irrita-
ble when a half-hour later the train sud-
denly stopped again in the midst of far-
stretching fields

  mr jentz thrust an anxious face
out of the window but could see noth-
ing to cause the delay

  a brakeman ran hurriedly through the
car mr jentz hailed him but the
brakeman did not pause nor answer so
mr jentz contented himself with scow-
ling after his retreating figure and mum-
bling to himself

  but as the train did not start imme-
diately mr jentz presently strode wrath-
fully out upon the platform a number
of trainmen with a bucket of water were
apparently doing something to one of the
wheels

  whats the matter demanded mr
jentz  what are you stopping here
for

   a hot box replied the conductor
shortly favoring mr jentz with one
brief look of disgust

  so resumed mr jentz irritably
 first it was cattle on the track and
now it is a hot box what will it be
next 

   i dont know admitted the conduc-
tor impatiently

   of course you dont know resumed
mr jentz  you havent had time to
make up your mind yet have you but
you seem determined to make me miss my
connections if you do-

  mr jentz did not say just what would
happen in that event but the altogether
savage expression of his countenance
boded ill to some one in the event the
dire calamity should occur

   plainly however any wrathful express-
sions which mr jentz might utter were
of little assistance in cooling a hot box
and so he returned to his seat and tried
vainly to conceal his anger

  whenthe train again got under way
mr jentz glanced at his watch and the
light of renewed hope came into his eyes

  so far as he could determine fully
fifteen minutes had already been lost
but as he had still some distance to
travel before reaching arlington junc-
tion it was possible that at least the nec-
essary five minutes of time could be
made up

  for perhaps an hour nothing more oc-
curred to ruffle mr jentzs feelings but
at the end of that period the train again
stopped suddenly far from any town

  this incident occurring at a moment
when mr jentzs nerves were far from
being in a tranquil condition precipi-
tated him into a state of great mental
excitement and he again hastened to the
front platform to investigate the cause
of the delay

   what- he began then paused
the conductor and brakeman were ex-
changing significant glances the brake-
man was laughing

   whats the matter with you fel-
lows roared mr jentz suspiciously
 are you laughing at me what

   not exactly replied the brakeman
 only i bet the con youd be the first
passenger to rubber i won

  indeed mr jentz was almost
fuming  and why shouldnt i  rub-
ber as you call it why shouldnt i
be anxious about these numerous and un-
necessary delays ive got to catch a
train at arlington junction and were
late now

   you seem to be very greatly ex-
cited ventured the brakeman soothing-
ly  you must have an important en-
gagement to keep

   i have snapped mr jentz pom-
pously  a very important engage-
ment indeed

   weddin   asked the brakeman
slyly

  mr jentzs mouth opened like a fish
gasping for breath then it closed again
with a snap and his face turned scarlet

   you-you- ha began breathing
heavily then his wandering vision be-
held a number of freight-cars standing
at the bottom of a steep grade ahead

   what - whats those cars doing
there  he finished

  too heavy a load replied the train-


tiie railroad mans magazine

man laconically  had to double the
hill

  double the hill mr jentz was
plainly puzzled  i do not understand
the brakeman regarded mr jentz
with infinite disgust

   they couldnt make the grade he
explained  and had to cut the train in
two theyll be back after the rest in
a few moments

   oh   a great light broke in upon
mr jentzs understanding then his brow
darkened  and we have to wait here
until they do he demanded

   reckon so replied the other
 there seems to be only one track
its an outrage mr jentz broke
forth all his pent-up indignation over-
flowing  a monstrous outrage 

  he got off the steps and paced back
and forth his eyes downcast his pudgy
hands clasped behind his back

   thats nothin rejoined the brake-
man flippantly  if you were a rail-
roader youd get used to it

  mr jentz turned suddenly and glared
at the trainman

   if i were a railroader he ejacu-
lated  id run my train on time or id
know the reason why

   and if i were a passenger retorted
the brakeman calmly  id keep my seat
and not get excited over trifles it
doesnt do any good

  no admitted mr jentz sorrow-
fully   it doesnt do any good when
trainmen are determined to miss connec-
tions you cant say or do anything to
make them change their minds

  and with this sarcastic rejoinder mr
jentz climbed laboriously aboard the
train and sought sanctuary in his seat

  after many moments-an age it
seemed to mr jentz-the train got un-
der way again he assumed a morose
attitude and glared at his fellow passen-
gers

  when at last he reached arlington
junction he disembarked hurriedly
hastened into the waiting-room and pre-
sented himself at the ticket-window

  has the local gone west yet he
asked excitedly

 yes sir replied the agent quietly
 it has it left about five minutes ago
for a brief instant a sulfuric explo-
sion trembled upon mr jentzs lips but

it did not materialize a woman and a
babe occupied an adjacent seat and the
woman appeared as though she were shy
and easily frightened

  heroically mr jentz controlled his
deep emotions and fixed his burning eyes
upon the agent

   where he inquired in a quavering
voice  can  find a secluded spot where
eye may not see nor ear hear i want to
swear	j

   dont admonished the agent sym-
pathetically sit down and save your
breath the limited will be along in a
few minutes

  the limited mr jentz was
breathing more easily	i

   yes sir it leaves here only a half-
hour behind the local

  for exactly three seconds mr jentz
regarded the agent in calm and unde-
monstrative silence then his lips parted
in a smile the smile broadened to a grin
and he once more pulsated with the joy
of living	i

  when the limited arrived mr jentz
boarded the rear pullman he thought
he could disembark therefrom at arling-
ton in a much jess conspicuous manner
than would be possible from one of the
forward cars

  and presently when the train whistled
for arlington and slowed down for the
station mr jentz suit - case in hand
stepped out upon the rear platform he
hoped he would be unnoticed by any one
he trusted that the crowd on the station
platform would be small that there
would be none there who knew him

  he realized that secrecy must mark his
movements that at all hazards he must
so far as possible avoid the public eye

  when therefore the train stopped and
mr jentz surveyed with anxious gaze
his surroundings he drew in his breath
with a loud noise the station platform
was black with a gay and enthusiastic
crowd of men women and children and
all eyes seemed fixed upon him -
flags were waving and at one corner
of the station building a band was play-
ing  hail to the chief  although its
strains could scarcely be heard above the
cheers of the multitude when they beheld
the portly form of mr jentz

  presently from out the throng mr
jentz beheld pressing its way toward
the two-twenty local



him what appeared to be a reception
committee

  the members of the committee caught
him by the arms they fairly pulled him
from the pullman  they grasped his hand
in theirs and shook it till it ached

  then with the assistance of several
policemen who drove back the surging
crowd they escorted him to waiting car-
riages

  and all the time mr jentz was so
overcome with surprise that he could not
utter a word vainly he tried to think
what it all could mean vainly he en-
deavored to fathom the mystery of this
unexpected and most demonstrative re-
ception

  and then it dawned upon mr jentzs
comprehension that a procession had
formed that it was marching up the
main street of the town that the top of
the carriage in which he was seated was
down so that every eye might see him
that the three other occupants of the
vehicle were total strangers to him al-
though from their appearance promi-
nent residents of arlington

  mr jentz felt the chills run up and
down his back  he felt his temples burn-
ing as though red-hot coals were pressed
against them on every side the popu-
lace seemed bent upon doing him homage

  lie felt that upon any other occasion
under any other circumstances he could
have enjoyed himself immensely but now
when secrecy was so desirable-heavens

  presently he became aware that the
carriage had drawn up beside the town
square that he was being escorted to a
platform about which another large
crowd had congregated

  he drew a hand across his eyes and
pinched himself then allowed his bewil-
dered vision to rest upon a well-groomed
individual who had advanced to the front
of the platform and was addressing those
assembled

    fellow citizens he was saying  i
will not take any of your time this after-
noon you did not come here to listen
to me but rather to harken to the elo-
quent words of our distinguished visitor

  mr jentz gasped cold perspiration
broke out all over him

   ladies and gentlemen the other
continued  it is my great pleasure to
introduce to you our next governor

  a wild cheer swelled up from the
crowd the well-groomed gentleman
had turned and was looking at mr jentz

  like one in a dream mr jentz found
himself trying to rise but his knees for-
sook him and he sank back weakly in
his chair

   gentlemen he exclaimed desperately
to those about him  you have made a
mistake-a very amusing mistake

  he attempted to laugh but the effort
was a feeble one he could feel ten
thousand eyes upon him  i am not
your candidate for governor i am not
a candidate for any office  am only-

  he paused suddenly he must not re-
veal his name his large business in-
terests had made it a familiar one in
arlington he must conceal his identity
in the presence of what appeared to be
the entire population of the town

   who are you    whats your
name    why did you attempt to im-
personate the governor   a dozen ex-
cited persons seemed speaking at once

  mr jentz groaned inwardly he was
not feeling in the best of spirits

   gentlemen gentlemen he expostu-
lated  i came to arlington for a cer-
tain purpose a legitimate purpose 
assure you but one which will not per-
mit of my revealing my identity at pres-
ent i was not trying to impersonate
anybody i did not force myself upon
you if you will remember you dragged
me from the train and compelled me to
accompany you i am sorry if i resemble
the next governor but i mean no harm
by that had it not been for the per-
verseness of trainmen on another road i
should have arrived here on the local
and this unfortunate incident would not
have happened i have not seen your
candidate i do not know where he is
or why he failed to come to arlington-

  the next few moments were moments
of great embarrassment to mr tentz
he managed to get off the platform
but was painfully conscious of suspicious
glances and derisive words

  a block distant he paused to again
dry his damp brow heavens he
exclaimed fervently

  then he turned and gazed down the
street toward the home of his fiancee

   heavens  he repeated  i wonder
if she was there

police duties need men

but bring honors

as well as the regular recognition of the

-	police authorities the policemen of new
york who have been fortunate enough to
save people from drowning at the risk of
their own lives receive medals of recogni-
tion from the united states life-saving
corps this year thirteen medals were dis-
tributed and of two other men who had
earned medals one died in the meantime
and the other was absent on sick leave

  the winners of silver medals were pa-
trolman joseph hecklev patrolman john f
murphy patrolman alexis kleinmeir and
patrolman john lynch the recipients of
bronze medals were patrolman thomas j
craddock patrolman james travis patrol-
man stephen crowley patrolman thomas
oloughlin george cadger doorman of the
bath beach station john j noonan henry
l lobdell and james dugan of the traffic
squad and james hughes of the harbor
squad

  the patrolman absent on sick leave was
frank a wolf who receives a silver medal
lieutenant callahan was to receive a bronze
medal but he died of heart-failure some
weeks before commissioner bingham dis-
tributed the medals and learning that john j
noonan of the traffic squad had in the
meantime become the father of twins he
called him forward shook hands with him
and hoped that there would be at least one
good policeman in the two

youth whose pluck was

backed by strength

from black lake michigan comes an-
other story of youthful heroism a
chicago boy of fifteen years rescued from
the waters of the lake his father and a
woman whom the father had made an in-
effectual attempt to save

  arthur wakcford the father saw the boat
of mrs frank g mason capsize and swam
to her rescue

  he reached her as she came up the second

time but the frantic woman flung her arms
around him and dragged him down mr
wakcford was helpless when his boy addi-
son who was rowing near by dived into
the water

  he succeeded in releasing his father from
the grasp of the woman and got him into the
boat he then went after the woman
whom he also managed ip drag into the boat

  when he got them to shore the man was
in the worse plight and it took considerably
longer to bring him out of danger than it
did to restore the woman whom he had tried
to save

v

blind devotion but

instinctive heroism

because she stayed to save her baby
sister carmella landria a little italian
girl of new york was crushed to death by
a trolley car the only details that could
be gathered came from the distressed motor-
man who had narrowly escaped a lynching
from a crowd of infuriated italians

  it seems that the little girl twelve years
old was taking her little twenty-months-old
sister across the street the little girl had
toddled on a few feet in advance and was
half-way across the tracks when a car was
suddenly seen to be bearing down on her

  the motorman flung on the brakes but he
was too near instantly the older sister
dashed forward practically diving under the
car and pushed her baby sister forward

  retreat for her was of course impossible
the car caught her and bore her under its
wheels and when she was extricated life
was extinct

  the baby was caught also but only one
foot was injured and she will recover

quick witted and prompt

at the age of five

determination and pluck were
written all over the feat performed
by the five-year-old daughter of william
williamson who lies near findlay ohio
industrial roll of honor

the child with her older sister aged seven
and several other children was playing
around a bonfire when the older girls cloth-
ing caught tire

  the rest of the children ran away in a
panic and the seven-year-old girl herself
was quite helpless with fright the little
one was anything but helpless

  first she tried valiantly to smother the
flames with her tiny hands but in this she
was unsuccessful then she seized her sis-
ter and dragged her to the yard pump
pushed her under the spout and pumped
water over her

this was effective and although the girl
was badly burned her life was saved the
younger girl was badly burned about the
hands but happy in the outcome of her feat


great bravery of

a rescued one

if the matter is carefully weighed it will
probably be conceded that the most
heroic part in a certain rescue at bath beach
recently was played by one of the rescued
ones two young boys joseph heck and
edward frost ten and twelve years respec-
tively had got into a rowboat while pad-
dling around on the beach and were so in-
tent on their play that they did not notice
that the boat was drifting from the shore
until it was three hundred feet away

  there were no oars in the boat and
neither boy could swim they called loudly
for help but the crowd on shore thought it
was part of their play and their only notice
was to laugh and jeer

  soon in his panic heck upsei the boat
frost managed to grab the bottom but
heck was pitched several feet away and in
spite of all his struggles could not reach it
then frost unable to swim did the heroic
thing

  on the off-chance that he would - able
to struggle back to the boat he let go his
safe hold and floundered to his friend but
heck had lost his nerve and his struggles
soon had both boys in the gravest peril

  just then two young men on the beach
with more intelligence than the others saw
the plighf of the children and swam out to
their help getting them safely to shore one
of the young men john russel is said to
have thirty lives to his credit



fire made and

nearly killed a hero

policeman philip bernstein
of brooklyn came pretty near to being
a dead hero after saving a man and woman

in a brooklyn fire and but for the efforts
of a fireman this would assuredly have been
his fate

  when bernstein discovered the fire at 
flushing avenue there was no time to give
an alarm before attending to the inmates
the policeman clambered on the roof of a
shed and broke into the burning building
by a second-story window

  there he found frank brenner and his
wife teresa both of them sixty-five years
of age lying on their lied stupefied by smoke
he first took the woman on his back and
climbed out onto the shed with her and then
returned for the old man

  he again returned and assisted a boarder
of the brenners to safety he was pushing
his way through the flame and smoke-filled
house when the floor on which he was walk-
ing collapsed and he was thrown info the
hall below being rendered unconscious by
the fall and the smoke in the meantime
somebody had given the alarm and a fireman
dashed into the blazing house and rescued
bernstein from his perilous position

dwights pluck gives
him a long swim

with what is described as a reckless
disregard of his own life lester s
dwight night wire chief of the american 
telephone and telegraph company new
york saved the life of a young woman at
bath beach some weeks ago

  dwight lives in a forty-foot sloop off
bath beach he had boarded a small boat
at captains pier with the intention of pull-
ing out to his sloop when he saw a young
woman run to the end of the pier and hurl
herself into the water

  instantly he jumped in after her though
the tide was running strongly out and the
night was pitch dark a moment later the
water having cooled the enthusiasm of tl-
young woman she began to shout lustily for
help and by the time dwight had reached
her she was so intent upon living that she
clutched him around the neck to the danger
of both

  he fought her off roughly and although
he is a strong man lie had to use all his
strength to subdue the fear-crazed woman

  dwights strength was fast giving out
when he bumped against the side of a small
boat which he managed to grab for half
an hour he had to cling to the boat before
his friends directed by the womans screams
could get help to him he refused medical
attention but the woman was taken to the
coney island hospital fortunately suffering
nothing worse than exhaustion from immer-
sion

icarcely had the clock struck
nine-thirty that evening when
parks accompanied by the
captain left the precinct sta-
tion and made his way up-
town the captain had prom-
ised him a speedy death should
he attempt to escape he did not ask
parks where they were going but jour-
neyed with his prisoner by trolley trans-
ferred to another line and stepped to the
street in a fashionable part of town

   what are you going to do up here
among the silk-stockings  demanded the
captain

parks smiled and consulted his watch

   you shall see soon he replied  it
is five minutes of ten and we have only
a block to go

  presently parks turned in at the door
of a large house the captain followed
wondering parks stepped to the door
and rang the bell before his hand could
drop to his side the door was opened
by a young man in evening dress who
fairly caught parks in his arms behind
him were other men in evening dress
who crowded close and asked a multi-
tude of questions

  just a moment said parks pushing
them away from him and laughing  i
am under arrest for murderous assault
and have been refused bail captain
deek here is guarding me allow me to
present him captain deek-mr how-
ard rockington 

beson in the june railroad hini

   rockington  gasped the captain
 not-

   yes muttered rockington reaching
for the captains hand  im the mil-
lionaire if thats what you mean come
in captain

   but this man-this teamster- the
captain indicated parks

   dont you know him   rockington
asked

   he gave his name as walter parks

   well-er-that isnt exactly his true
name you know his real name is wal-
ter parker 

   not-

  exactly said rockington -the
walter parker 

   but- began the captain

  rockington laughed

   well go into the other room and ex-
plain he said  come

  when they were seated in the other
room and the captain was thankfully
sipping a glass of wine rockington ex-
plained

   have you ever heard of the courage
club  he asked

   i have heard something of such an
organization the captain admitted

   all the gentlemen present are mem-
bers continued rockington  with the
exception of yourself and mr parker
parker will be a member i expect within
an hour some time ago you will remem-
ber herr burgher the eminent scholar
declared in an article that the rich young
men of america were moral and physical
cowards that they were unable to go

   aiinc single coplea  centi

 
the courage club



 into the world penniless and make their
 own livings that they were wanting in
 courtesy o women and a number of dis-
 agreeable things like that

     we took exception to herr burghers
 statements and the courage club was
 formed to prove them false every ap-
 plicant for membership is compelled to
 undergo a test for one month mr
 barker has finished his test to-night

    he had orders to leave his home
 without a cent in his pocket obtain a
 position of some sort and exist for a
 month on what he earned he was not
 to appeal to friends or relatives for help
 he was not to disclose his real identity
 he was to show courage if an opportunity
 presented itself and he was to be cour-
 teous to women at all times

    parker smiled

     i got in trouble by going to a wom-
 ans aid he said then he turned to the
 captain  you understand now he con-
 tinued  why i said i could get bail after
 ten oclock to-night my test would be
 ended then and  could use my own iden-
 tity and the influence it exerts

     if  had only known you began the
 captain

    it was against the rules of the club
 for me to tell you my real name

    if you had called your lawyer-

    that would have been contrary to
 the clubs rules also

     i see said the captain

     if you will remain in this room cap-
 tain said rockington  while we listen
 to mr parkers story and admit him to
 membership in the club if he deserves it
 ill pledge you my word of honor that
 ill return your prisoner to you after-
 ward

     it isnt necessary said the captain
   mr parker may go on his own recog-
  nizance

    	but i am charged with murderous as-
 sault protested parker

    i pray you will not feel annoyed

-	ill see that you are not bothered per-
 haps-perhaps i have been too hasty 

    but you think i am a smooth thug
 you know said parker smiling

    i hope you will forget anything i
 fnay have said i-i am sorry for what
 has occurred

     just one thing said parker  are
 you saying these things because  am a

rich man or because you know i was un-
justly accused and held

    because faltered the captain  you
were-er-unjustly accused and held

   thank you replied parker  youll
know where to find me if i am wanted
yes sir but i think youll not be
wanted sir

   as for miss adleys case ill be on
hand to testify continued parker to the
captain  and if the thug who assaulted
her gets his just deserts i may forget
what  know concerning the part the
police played in the affair but if there
is the least hint of an attempt to let him
off easy-

    hell get his just deserts said the
captain  ill bid you good evening
gentlemen

  are you the chap jack adley de-
manded  who helped my sister out of
that scrape 

   i am parker answered  and id
like to be properly introduced to her as
soon as this club is done with me ive
never met her you know

	 she came back from school just as

i	went to europe and just as i returned
from europe i was detailed on this
courage club test i-well i want to
meet her 

 ill see that you do  said adley
the captain weakly cheerful took his
departure and parker turned to the men
who were soon to call him a fellow mem-
ber

  well ill be shot heres my most
intimate friend richard druke dick
will you tell me how you could be a mem-
ber of the courage club without my
knowing it

  rockington laughed  there are
many things happen that the novitiates of
the courage club do not understand he
said  as druke here can testify he
was admitted last night and his conduct
well deserved it as you will see from the
record of the club after you have been
admitted

  druke- grinned and looked embar-
rassed  well he said  i dont sup-
pose ill ever get over the  goat  feature
of that adventure but when parker reads
the record i think hell agree that it was
anything in the world but a joke to me
at the time

  parker did read the record and sub-


the railroad mans magazine

stantially-though the modesty of druke
somewhat spoiled the formal narrative--
this is the story he read

of the story of drakes failure to find
himself

i

xfr c h a rles ellsworth
sat on a park - bench his head
bowed in his hands the clothes he wore
were indicative of poverty there was a
stubby beard on his face and his hair
was snarled and unkempt

  it was five oclock in the morning of
a beautiful summer day ellsworth had
occupied the bench since ten oclock the
evening before he was aware of the
fact that the light of day brought its dis-
advantages such as gardeners and park
policemen it was undoubtedly time for
him to move but he had no particular
place to go

  hunger gnawed at him he wanted
to wash his hands and face and finally
managed to accomplish this feat at a
fountain when there was no one about
drying them on a bunch of grass he tore
from the lawn then he shuffled down
the walk toward a side entrance he
knew from experience that the main en-
trance was to be avoided at that hour of
the morning for the officer stationed
there had a knack of asking searching
questions of ragged gentlemen who looked
as though they had spent the night on a
bench

  he passed dirough the side entrance
safely and started down the street he
was hungry he had no money with which
to purchase food and for certain rea-
sons it was denied him to beg as he
left the street which ran alongside the
park and turned into another he was
joined by another man whose appear-
ance indicated that he too had spent the
night on a bench

 what suite did you have  this man
demanded hurrying to ellsworths side

  ellsworth smiled at the others op-
timism

  	i fail to remember the number he
said

 theres one thing i dont like about
this open-air hotel the stranger com-

mented  it doesnt serve meals and
you have to get out and hustle for your
breakfast

   ive noticed that remarked ells-
worth

   what particular cafe are you going
to patronize this morning

   my physician says i should not eat
of heavy breakfasts replied ellsworth
smiling grimly  he declares that at
times it is beneficial to go entirely with-
out food until the day is well advanced
the other man ceased to smile and
regarded ellsworth searchingly

   it isnt as bad as that is it he
asked are you down and out
havent you the price of a meal  

   i havent the price of a toothpick
admitted ellsworth

   are you hungry  

 am i say im used to three
square meals a day-three big fat
luscious well-done meals per day or at
least there was a time when-

    know replied the other  all of
us can say that there once was a time

   i could eat anything that had the
slightest resemblance of food said ells-
worth

  the other man took ellsworth by the
arm

   my names hodges he said  i
like you im going to whisper some-
thing in your pearl-like ear bend your
head this way thats right now
listen i have in my left-hand trousers-
pocket a quarter of a dollar 

   no   cried ellsworth

   yes  affirmed hodges  i couldnt
sleep last night because i was afraid some
one would touch me for it i dont want
to lose another nights sleep so suppose
we go to the nearest restaurant and eat
twenty-five cents worth of what we can
get the most of for the money

   i couldnt think of it- began ells-
worth

   see here  said hodges  youre a
green one at this down-and-out business
you dont understand it neednt hurt
your confounded pride at all i mean
im making you my pal and were part-
ners from now on and when i have
money half of it is yours when you
have money and im out youll have to
split with me see its a straight busi-
ness deal im not giving you anything
the courage club



youre not getting any charily if thats
what bothers you come on and eat
thanks said ellsworth   will
a few minutes later they were sitting
at a greasy table in a restaurant of ques-
tionable cleanliness before them was
meat soup and bread and black coffee

  ellsworth who had in his life eaten
many excellent dinners did not turn up
his nose at the food before him hodges
who had also seen more pleasant days ate
with relish

  anything on to-day he asked
looking across at ellsworth

   no

   looking for a job 

    sure 

  so am i well get through here
and then go down to the collage

   college  gasped ellsworth

   sure you must be green  dont
you know about the college its a cer-
tain saloon not far from here you cant
find it unless youre wise

   its the place to go when youre
down and out and simply must have a
job theres always something doing
there the pays good but sometimes the
jobs are shady

   but-you said college

   sure thats what we call it-the
college of odd jobs

   i see  said ellsworth  but i
dont want to mix up in anything shady
 dont be afraid son well just go
down and look over the ground if there
isnt anything that suits us well walk out
again they cant boss us around we
dont have to take a job why man
weve had a meal 

ii

  the college of odd jobs was also an
odd college of jobs it was a saloon as
llodges had declared in a blind-alley
where you knocked three times at a lialf-
hidden door and then walked through a
dark hall before emerging into the bar-
room

  when ellsworth and hodges arrived
there were but a few men sitting at the
tables the most of them engaged in
earnest conversation hodges nodded to
the bartender and was invited over to
have a drink ellsworth was included in
the invitation 

   my friend and i began hodges
 have had a meal this morning and are
feeling like sons of wealth but if you
know of anything easy that holds out
promise of great reward we dont mind
soiling our hands with a little work just
for the sake of the exercise

   so  said the bartender  well do
you know gordon  

    know hes the craziest crook in
town   exclaimed hodges

   he has a deal on thats straight
continued the bartender he wants a
man or two hes in one of the rooms
now shall i call him out  

  sure said hodges well hear
what he has to say 

  the bartender walked across the room
and knocked on a door it was opened
immediately there was a short con-
versation and then there stepped into the
main room a typical prosperous crook
dressed in the approved fashion for gen-
tlemen of that sort his silk hat loud ap-
parel large diamond stud red face and
shaggy brow advertising him for what he
was

  he looked at llodges and ellsworth
searchingly for a moment then beck-
oned them to step into the little room
closing the door and seating himself op-
posite them he continued his inspection 
then apparently satisfied he spoke

   want to earn some money  he de-
manded

 depends on the job replied hodges
it was evident that hodges was not a
stranger to such dealings and ellsworth
wisely left the entire matter in his hands

   this job is legal enough in its way
said gordon leaning over the table and
speaking in a hoarse whisper it takes
a little nerve and a mighty quiet tongue
 my friend and i have plenty of nerve
and know how to keep our mouths shut
said llodges

   this is the deal said gordon  a
certain young millionaire has it in for
another young millionaire the second
gent is trying to do a certain thing the
first gent wants him to fail the second
gent is-to be taken care of until after a
certain time he isnt to be injured or
mistreated but hes supposed to be at
a certain place at a certain time and the
first gent doesnt want him to be there
wedding asked hodges


the railroad mans magazine

    no smiled gordon

   does the gent you want detained
drink 

    he does not get foolishly drunk if
thats what you mean and youll not he
able to hold him by giving him liquor
but you ought to be able to carry out
the scheme without getting into trouble
it looks easy to me

  what about it asked hodges
drawing one eye down into a wink

    the first gent supplies me with a cer-
tain sum if i succeed im too busy to
take care of the second gent myself you
two men take the job and ill give you
fifty dollars each now for expenses and
five hundred between you if you succeed
but youll have to play fair you know
me if you take my fifty dollars you
have to do your best to succeed  

    see here  said hodges  how are
two tramps like us to get our hands on
a young millionaire and keep him out of
sight unless we hit him on the head with
an a  as a usual thing we dont chum
with millionaires

    that part will be easy enough said
gordon do you take the job
tell us all about it said hodges
 if it suits well take the job if it
doesnt well keep mum about what you
tell us you neednt be afraid

    ill tell you said gordon  did
you ever hear of the courage club

    cijnt say that i have said hodges
 well continued gordon  a lot of
fool young millionaires in town have
formed what they call the courage
club before a man can become a mem-
ber he has to go out for a month and
make iis own living and while hes do-
ing it he has to show nerve if he has the
chance and be kind and gentle to women
and a lot of rot like that theyre doing
it because some german author said
young millionaires of america were sissy-
boys

    this second young gent i mentioned
is somewhere in town dressed like a
tramp trying to earn his own living for
a month in order to qualify for mem-
bership he has to report to the club at
a certain hour on a certain night tf he
doesnt lie fails to become a member
see

    the first young gent is sore on die
second young gent he doesnt want the

second young gent to become a member
if the second young gent fails it will be
noised abroad as they say and may reach
the ears of a certain young lady in whom
both young gents are interested

  oh i see said hodges

   you are to find this tramp mil-
lionaire and keep him from reporting at
the appointed hour you ought to be
able to spot a millionaire in disguise in a
minute

  whats he look like hodges
asked

    six feet tall dark hair dark eyes
and thats about all i can tell you he
looks like lots of other men youll have
to use your wits to find him

   how long do we have to take care
of him  

   this is tuesday morning he is to
report to the courage club at ten oclock
friday night you see your time is
short youll have to hurry one min-
ute after ten oclock you can let him go
see but dont hurt him because i
promised thered be nothing of that sort
done f

  whats his name demanded
hodges

   his name is richard f druke

    ive heard of him said hodges

   ellsworth leaned across the table and
looked directly into gordons eyes

   and the other gent-the one who
wants this druke detained-what is his
name ellsworth asked

   gordon smiled

    i cant tell you he said  and it
doesnt make any difference because
youll get your money just the same im
a man of my word

    im willing to take the job said
hodges  if my friend-

   i am willing interrupted ells-
worth

  gordon gave each of them fifty dol-
lars in bills and instructed them to re-
port to him each evening then he
called for drinks and bade them start on
their mission

   hodges led the way through the alley
to the street

    hows this for a snap  he asked

    it isnt such a snap as it looks to be
replied ellsworth

   why

    youll not succeed
the courage club



   dont you think well find him

   yes-butnot hold him 

   why

    thats just my opinion

    its easy said hodges- easy just
follow me 

iii

  tuesday evening wednesday eve-
ning and thursday evening hodges ao-
companied by ellsworth journeyed to the
college of odd jobs and reported to
gordon that they had not found the
slightest trace of richard f druke

  on thursday evening gordon grew
somewhat furious

   you must find him   he cried  i
stand to lose a good fee if you dont

 tell you hes somewhere in the city
dressed like a common laborer and try-
ing to make his living cant you spot
a millionaire made up for an honest work-
ingman every move ought to give him
away watch all the cheap lodging-
houses

   we have said hodges  and
weve made the rounds of benches in the
parks and peeped into jails and kept
our eyes and ears open and we havent
heard of a tramp that acts like a mil-
lionaire and we havent seen one that
looks anything like a millionaire

   you must find him   repeated gor-
don emphatically  see here i said
id give you five hundred between you if
you succeeded ill make it six hundred
-thatll be three hundred each

   were on the square  declared
hodges  were not making a play for
more money five hundred is enough-
but we cant find him

   six hundred ive made it and that
goes said gordon  you go out again
and get on the job remember the
time is up at ten oclock to-morrow night
you must find him before that time and
keep him a prisoner until after the hour
of ten it will be all the easier now-
youll not have to hold him so long

   well we can try again said
hodges

  ellsworth spoke up

 i know a little about this business
he said  i dont believe ive mentioned
it before but-i know this man druke
you know him gasped hodges
and gordon together

   ive seen him lots of times said
ellsworth

   what club gave you a job as a wait-
er sneered hodges

   im telling you the truth  know
him and  guess there are a few cards
that havent been played yet you be
here at ten oclock to-morrow night jor-
don you wait here until hodges and
myself come well be here soon after
ten ill show you something thatll star-
tle you

   yon know where to find him  asked
gordon

   yes

   why havent you done it then  de-
manded hodges

   never mind why i havent you be
here at ten to-morrow night gordon and
wait for us i dont know how much
that man was going to pay you for hold-
ing druke but i guess youll not lose the
money whether druke is found or not

   you talk mighty funny said gor-
don  i dont like it

   youll be here at ten asked ells-
worth

  gordon looked at hodges and the
latter gave the former a glance which
meant that he would see no underhanded
tricks were played

   whatever you do and wherever you
go i suppose hodges will be with you
gordon said

   certainly replied ellsworth  and
you neednt be afraid of anything ill
not try any dirty work you be here at
ten and youll be amused

   ill be here said gordon

  ellsworth and hodges left the college
of odd jobs ate dinner at a convenient
restaurant and spent an hour walking
about the streets hodges was naturally
inquisitive ellsworth wouldnt explain

   you said you knew where to find
him hodges complained

   i do but were not going to find
him

   not at all

   not at all replied ellsworth

  and lose three hundred apiece
thats not being the good pal 

   youll not lose your three hundred
and you may get more said ellsworth

   you mean youre going to hold up
this man druke for more by putting him
wise to the plot 


this railroad mans magazine

   not exactly said ellsworth

   i give you up  exclaimed hodges
 but arc you sure ill get that threehun-
dred

   absolutely sure  

   no chance of anything spoiling it
   not the least chance

  you may be crazy remarked
llodges  but ill take your word
they spent the remainder of the eve-
ning loitering about town slept well and
loafed all day friday it was evident
that llodges was losing faith in ells-
worth he asked him repeatedly whether
there was any chance of losing

  as they sat at dinner that night ells-
worth issued his orders

   were fjoing up to a swell part of
town he said  were going to the
apartments of howard rockington an-
other young millionaire hes the presi-
dent of the courage club this man
druke is to be there at ten oclock you
heard gordon say that

   but what are you going to do  
hodges demanded

  just leave that to me said ells-
worth

  ten minutes before ten oclock they
stood on the corner nearest the apart-
ments of howard rockington in the
shadow of a high wall and watched car-
riages and automobiles drop their passen-
gers before rockingtons door

   it is five minutes of ten said ells-
worth finally  im going in that place
-where the others are going you wait
for me here ill not be over half an
hour be ready to hurry back to the col-
lege of odd jobs with me as soon as i
come out

   if you need any help began
hodges

   theres not a particle of danger re-
plied ellsworth  i tell you i know this
man druke

  hodges watched from the shadow of
the wall as ellsworth walked quickly
down the street up the steps and pulled
at the bell in an instant the door was
opened and ellsworth stepped inside

iv

  howard rockington stopped in the
middle of a story he was telling as the
valet touched his arm

   well lie questioned

    man to see you sir he says it is
very important

  rockington excused himself and
stepped into the hall the other mem-
bers of the courage club talked on re-
telling their own experiences wondering
whether druke the latest candidate
would have a thrilling tale to relate

	presently rockington returned

  as he resumed his seat he appeared
thoughtful he took little interest in the
conversation finally he looked at his
watch -

   one minute of ten he said  i
wonder-

   the door was thrown open

  am i in time some one asked

    its druke  cried the others spring-
ing to their feet and crowding about
him

   after congratulations were over the
men settled back in their chairs to hear
drukes story

    before i tell you my experiences
he said  there is a little matter that de-
mands attention i want to go away for
perhaps an hour and i want rockington
fred gale and bulkand to go with me-
or rather follow me ill give my in-
structions to rockington and he will tell
the other two what to do if the rest of
you will chat and smoke and play cards
until we return i promise you a sensa-
tion

   druke took rockington to one side and
talked to him for several minutes

  then he left them and went into the
street

v

  hodges waiting under the wall saw
ellsworth come from the house and walk
toward him he stepped out to meet
him

  come on ellsworth said we
must hurry and get to the college of odd
jobs as soon as possible im going to
hail that cab

    all right if youve got money to
spend on cabs

    ellsworth did not reply but hailed
the cab gave the driver an address and
they got in they whirled through the
streets rapidly and stepped from the
vehicle at the corner nearest the college
an automobile was following less than a
the courage club



block behind them but neither gave it any
attention

  gordon was waiting for them in one
of the little rooms an empty bottle be-
fore him he looked up angrily as they
entered

   its nearly eleven oclock he said
 ive waited here until im tired now
out with your story what is it you have
to tell what have you done where
does the money come in-or does it come
in

  ellsworth seated himself by the table
and motioned for hodges to do the
same

   you wanted us to find this man
druke and prevent him from showing up
at the headquarters of the courage club
at ten oclock to-night is that it   he
asked

   that was the scheme replied gor-
don

   i knew the moment we started out on
the job that we would never do it

   you knew why 

   that doesnt matter just yet what
i want to know before  go  with my
story is who was the man that offered
you money to get druke 

    ill not tell you  

   but i insist on knowing said ells-
worth

   it doesnt make any difference he
wasnt to be mentioned in the deal what
right have you to insist  

   every right in the world  cried
ellsworth bringing one fist down upon
the table i am richard druke

   what  cried gordon and hodges
in a breath

   and you hired me to capture and de-
tain myself 

  eh gasped gordon

   and you gave me expense money to
do it and offered me more when it was
done 

   of course- gordon began

  why didnt you tell me hodges
demanded angrily

   because i was on my word of honor
to the courage club to exist for one
month as ellsworth earn my own living
and under no circumstances to reveal my
identity therefore  couldnt tell you
i was druke also being in honor bound
to report to the club at ten to-night i
couldnt conscientiously allow myself to

be made a prisoner by myself isnt that
good 

    dont see anything funny in it
said gordon

   it isnt exactly funny

   what do you mean by that  gor-
don demanded  do you think youll
hand me over to the police gordon
sprang from his chair his face purple
with rage  millionaire or  million-
aire you dont play double with me 

   sit down 

   ill see you-

  druke drew a revolver quickly and held
the muzzle at gordons breast

   sit down  he ordered

  gordon sat down

   i have said nothing about the po-
lice said druke   have no intention
of giving you into custody but i want
to know one thing-who paid you to have
me captured and detained  

   i dont like to squeal on a man

   was it bulkand 

   i dont-

   was it bulkand  demanded druke
   yes 

  ah and now sit perfectly still
please until  admit a few friends of
mine you neeednt be alarmed gor-
don  they are not officers they are mem-
bers of the courage club i just want
to convince them of bulkands perfidy
druke arose and left the room gor-
don leaned across the table and whis-
pered to hodges

  think hes playing double he de-
manded

   i dont know but i dont think so
hes not that kind of a man

   a lot you know about it  scoffed
gordon  youve been running around
with him for a week and havent been
wise youre a-a-

  you neednt get sassy exclaimed
hodges  dont i lose that three hun-
dred im just as sore as you but its
a mighty good joke  

  joke  sniffed gordon

  the door opened again and druke
entered ushering in rockington gale
and bulkand

  now gordon said druke i want
you to tell the truth you were hired to
find me and prevent me from reporting
at the courage club on time to-night
were you not 


the railroad mans magazine

   i was answered gordon

   who hired you to do it 

   that man there  said gordon
pointing to bulkand

  druke turned to rockington

   is that convincing  he asked

    it is

   i wanted you an gale to hear it
druke continued  and  wanted bul-
kand to be here this gives me as much
pain as any of you it is the first time i
believe that any of the men in our im-
mediate set have been guilty of such un-
gentlemanly conduct of course we can
do nothing except where the courage
club is concerned

   bulkand has not exactly committed a
crime but he has been guilty of such
underhanded work that none of us can
call him friend again he has cast a
shadow on an organization formed for
the purpose of showing the world that we
are honest straightforward men he has
been untrue to the foundation principles
of the club and-

  bulkand laughed heartily  stop him
rockington hes giving me an awful
character   he exclaimed

   you can laugh at such a thing as
this you consider it a lark cried
druke

  rockington stepped forward and put
a hand on drakes shoulder

   there there old man well all
laugh he said  cant you under-
stand bulkand isnt half the villain
youve painted him we watched your
progress during the month and saw that
while you were having a hard time of it
you were not meeting with any expe-
riences that were a test of physical
courage i got bulkand to hire this man
to capture you we thought you might
have a chance to fight your way out

  druke gasped

   then- he began

the

    you owe your apologies to bulkand
 continued rockington smiling  this
 man here was in earnest-he didnt know
 but that bulkand was sincere hell get
 the money promised him just as though
 he had succeeeded and you have been
 given some exciting experiences after all
 not every man is engaged to make a pris-
 oner of himself

    you fellows are making me dippy  
 complained gordon weakly

    and the foundation principles of the
 club are preserved added rockington
  may we call bulkand a friend

   it seems i have made an ass of my-
self said drake

    not at all your deductions were
natural said rockington  and now
if you have no objections well return to
club headquarters and allow you to re-
cite the other fellows are waiting to
hear your story remember

   rockington led the way to the door
 after him went gale and bulkand
 druke stopped midway and looked back
 at hodges then he returned to the ta-
 ble and clasped him by the hand

    the first time i met you said druke
 - when you had never seen me before
 and knew absolutely nothing of me when
 i was hungry and tired and almost worn
 out you divided with me all you had in
 the world do you think i am going to
 forget a thing like that heres some-
 thing to keep you going for a day or two 
 -he handed hodges some bills- and
 in a few days i want you to come to me
 heres my card come to that address
 and ill have something to tell you
 hodges old man youll never go hungry
 again as long as i have plenty

   then youre not-not sore be-
cause-

   bless vou no  said druke
 youve helped me to graduate from
the college of odd jobs

e p day
riding the rail from coast
to coast

by gilson willets

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

the oregon short line runs from green river w yoming across the
picturesque valleys and mountains of southern idaho into oregon

      the boys of that line know the indian and the prairie-the real tang
of the west is in their blood

   they have lived close to danger they have endured the hardships of
the snow-bound they have known real hairbreadth escapes but their stories
are touched with humor-in fact in these later years they see only the bright
side of their experiences

no -tales of the oregon short line

mckinney had to deliver the mail or die what it really means
to be snow-bound the wonderful heroism of  idaho
mary and the man who lost both feet

was frozen to death in the mountains-
the foothills of the sawtooth range in
idaho-while carrying the mail from
atlanta to rocky bar

   it was christmas morning 
said dreer  and though snow was
falling with that sort of promise of evil
to him who gets caught in it thereabouts
mckinney swore he wasnt- in any doubt
about getting to rocky bar that same
night and therefore didnt need any-
thing more to eat than his usual cake of
chocolate

   mckinney always was the very
darnedest of conscientious men when
he worked over in oregon on the short
line he was so conscientious in perform-
ing his duties as section-hand that he
simply couldnt work as fast as othei
men he insisted always upon giving
the hand-car a little extra grease and

series began in march r a i  r o a a mn ma eat inc single copies  cent

                                    

            the oregon short line
station at butte mon-
tana the train for po-
catello idaho backed
up to the platform ready
to pull out it was then
only about  pm the train was not
scheduled to leave till somewhere near
five yet in the accommodating fashion
of western trains number  had al-
ready opened her doors to traveling sales-
men indian agents redskins squaws
cowboys miners and the writer who
had arrived early to have a chat with
phil dreer the railway mail-clerk

  my sole object in getting to the sta-
tion early was to get from phil some fur-
ther details of the story of one george
mckinney a railroad man who had
turned mail-carrier and had lost his life
in the discharge of his duty mckinney


the railroad mans magazine

every spike he drove was given a few
additional taps of the hammer that
meant delays that got on the bosss
nerves-and mckinney was let go

   that was in the spring of  mc-
kinney decided he werent no railroad
man-and he lit out for idaho fetched
up at atlanta and got the job as mail-
carrier he always made the trip on
foot and on this particular christmas
morning some fellers over to atlanta
said to him

    mckinney the wind and snow is
all blizzardy you better wait till to-
rnorrer and let the mail go hang be-
sides this heres christmas

  if its christmas replied mckin-
ney  then all the more reason why i
should get the mail over to rocky bar
to those folkses theyll be wantin their
santa claus rememoratings

   and with that mckinney slung the
mail-bag and his snow-shoes over his
shoulders and struck out toward the hills
through a falling snow that was even
then blinding

among the missing

   well that christmas night rocky
bar miners and the like gathered in the
 chamber of commerce -thats the sa-
loon near the post-office-shook the snow
from their clothes hugged the stove
looked at one another significantly and
remarked  that mail man hasnt shown
up yet

   the bartender of the chamber of
commerce ventured to suggest that as
it was christmas day the mail-carrier
was probably drunk that bartender
was there and then given to understand
by his customers that any further guesses
of the kind relating to the mail-carrier
would lead to a boycott of the place in
favor of the board of trade farther
down the street-as mckinney they
stoutly insisted was not a man to take
even a nip while in the performance of
his service in uncle sams pay

   the day after christmas passed
and the second day after and still no
sign of mckinney still ho mail for
rocky bar from atlanta way on the
third clay after christmas pheolix the
other mail-carrier on the same route al-
lowed that it was about time some one

went forth in search of the missing mc-
kinney

   pheolix himself then started out
through the deep snow as a relief com-
mittee of one a mile and a half from
rocky bar he stopped at the ranch-house
of a mr kehno and asked if mckinney
was sheltering there no mckinney
had not been seen nor any sign of him
pheolix plodded on and about six hun-
dred feet from mr kebnos door he
came upon a sight that nearly froze his
blood

   the sight that met the eyes of pheo-
lix was the body of a man lying in the
snow in the attitude of one who had de-
cided that that place was as good as any
in which to go to bed on each side of
him was a snow-shoe one of the snow-
shoes pheolix perceived was broken

   in that broken snow-shoe pheolix
read the whole story

   mckinney had floundered in the snow
for three days and nights he had at-
tempted to mend the snow-shoe and had
fallen asleep that he had lost his
bearings was evident from the fact that
he had perished so near to m r kehnos
house in his hand he clutched the mail-
bag as only a dead hand can clutch the
thing for which in his last moments he
struggled in vain

one lonely letter

   they carried mckinneys body to
rocky bar and took the mail-bag to
the post-office and here comes the fact
that makes this old old story brand new
when the mail-bag was opened only a
single letter was found it was ad-
dressed  george mckinney ltnited
states postman rocky bar idaho -
and was postmarked at mckinneys old
home town in oregon

  a few minutes after phil dreer rail-
way mail-clerk finished telling the above
tale of the conscientious mckinney i
boarded the waiting train for pocatello
by the time we passed high bridge the
first station in idaho the snow was no
longer coming down in mere bunches
but was beating against the car-windows
with terrific gale-blown force

  our train would go ahead a little
then rest as if getting its breath for an-
other struggle then push on a little far-
riding the rail from coast to coast



ther with almost tornado force the
wind struck us as if bound to lift our
car out of the train tear it from its coup-
lings and carry us off down the mountain

  in the sinoking-compartinent of the
pullman there were four besides the man
from bonners ferry and myself there
was a traveliug salesman from the fast
and a government indian agent of the

of wild-west stories which that indian
agent related about his thirty years of
experience on the railroads of the west
his duties called him to all the indian
reservations west of the mississippi

  he had just come from the white
earth reservation at the very north of
minnesota and was working his way
down to a reservation in southern cali-

inspection department from everywhere
west we were scheduled to arrive at
pocatello at one in the morning and we
deemed it not worth while to turn in

   we might as well get some sleep
gentlemen said the indian agent  for
at this rate we wont get to pocatello till
morning

  but we did not turn in for some hours
later-all because of the wondrous fund

fornia below san diego-below the rail-
road

a flying caboose

but it was the traveling salesman who
spoke first

 you say this wind seems determined
to lift this car out of the train well if
the wind did that to us it wouldnt be the
first time in railroad history it would

mckinney slung the mail-bag and his snow-shoes over his
shoulders and struck out toward the hills


the railroad mans magazine

be the second time and it would be the
second time within one week for ac-
cording to records that has happened
only once in the annals of railroading

  it was over on sherman pass on the
union pacific near cheyenne-and thats
not so very far from where we are now a
gale there the other day-the eastern end
of this same gale we are getting here and
now-lifted the caboose of a work-train
bodily tore it from its couplings and
carried it thirty feet down into a gorge
the caboose turned somersault in its
flight killing two japanese laborers and
injuring a lot of others seriously in-
cluding conductor jimmy lowery and
roadmaster bill curtis

  it was here that the indian agent
joined in the talkfest

   that was a peculiar and unusual ac-
cident our friend here tells of he be-
gan  i am not surprised that it hap-
pened on the union pacific for from
cheyenne west the whole union pacific
country is notoriously the worst in the
rocky mountain region for blizzards
and stalled trains

-	lost in the snow

   but the blowing of that caboose out
of the train was an accident that was
over and done with all in a jiffy-except-
ing of course for those who were in-
jured besides it happened to soldiers
on duty-for railroad men are but as
soldiers and must expect such things

   so now im going to tell you not
of a mere accident but of exquisite tor-
ture lasting all of two weeks and involv-
ing not only soldiers of the rail but a
number of passengers

   to get you to appreciate this tale of
torture gentlemen i ask you to imagine
this train as becoming stalled now it
is dark so you cannot see what sort of
country we are stalled in but i know
the place and nowhere can you see hu-
man habitation imagine us as being
stalled here for fourteen days we have
a diner tw be sure but how long would
the food last among all these passengers

   well to this condition add the fol-
lowing  a branch road for which no ro-
tary snow-plow is available all such
plows being at work night and day on
the main line  a train consisting of en-

gine two day coaches and caboose stalled
in the mountains with only three small
ranch-houses within five miles-snow in
front and behind you sixteen feet high
so that even a relief-train cannot get to
you on board your train there are fifty-
two souls including five trainmen twen-
ty-five section-hands and twenty-two pas-
sengers among whom are four women

  and no food except a small quantity
of beans and bacon no way to cook ex-
cept inside the car-stoves the fuel giving
out for both engine and stoves so that
your beans and bacon can no longer be
warmed and your engine dies no heat
in your cars and no blankets and the
temperature from ten to forty below zero
-and you have an approach to the con-
ditions of torture that figure in my story

   now i was in cheyenne when this
happened on the cheyenne and northern
a branch of the union pacific the
superintendent of that branch was my
friend rasbeck he himself was aboard

   the train left own junction
wyoming only fifty-four miles from
cheyenne on february   all
hands expected to make the run through
the snow-storm in one day yet at the
end of forty-eight hours of struggling
with wind and snow the train had gone
only as far as iron mountain only a
few miles from orin junction

   iron mountain was a way station
where there was nothing but one small
ranch-house there they found they
could go no farther and there rasbeck
took active command

   water for the engine rasbeck said
was the first essential he ordered the
engineer to run back five miles to a
water-tank when the train started
forward again the drifts were too much
for them and they had to shovel snow
for two whole days to get back over the
five miles to iron mountain

the two heroes

   they had an abundance of food on
the train at the start of the stall but
this quickly vanished rasbeck then
took the four women to the ranch-house
two days later they came back to the
train saying that the food had given
out at the ranch-house and so their only
course was to return to the train
riding the rail from coast to coast



ask

   rasbeck then sent out two train-
men to hustle for bread and foursection-
hands to kill a steer the trainmen came
back with the bread beans and bacon
but the seetion-men returned empty-
handed in one day the bread gave out
and they were left once more with only
a small quantity of beans and bacon

   rasbeck showed them how to cook
the rations inside the car-stoves-till the
fuel gave out now came the period of
the worst suffering raw food no heat

in the cars no blankets and terrible suf-
fering from cold hunger thirst and ex-
posure

   meantime rasbeck had kept the
section-men digging snow well those
men actually wore out the shovels and
wore out their shoes and their gloves in
digging-so that many of them fell sick
and on the tenth day of the torture
less than half the entire force on the
train was available for work

   on the twelfth day out the fires died

he didnt put in no buts nor
any questions


the railroad mans magazine

for lack of fuel the passengers be-
lieved they were succumbing to imminent
death every stomach refused raw ba-
con and beans-and all this time not a
single sign from the outside world not
a word from cheyenne about relief

   on that twelfth day rasbeck went
to the strongest man on board a section-
man who seemed the least weakened
physically and said

    oapeley the rescue of this ships

   suddenly - the tingle of a sleigh-
bell was heard and with that tingle
gentlemen your own imagination will
complete the tale

lost both feet

   but that sectlon-man oapeley said
the indian agent  who went on the
snow-shoes and saved em all-he froze
his feet and the railroad doctor at

company now depends upon you i can-
not do the job myself-for i must not
desert the sinking vessel there are
snow-shoes on board-you must put on
those shoes and get away from here and
walk - walk god knows where - but
walk you must till you reach some place
or some means of sending relief to us

    if they cant get a relief-train
through see that sleds or wagons are
sent this is the commission i give you
it is a forlorn hope heaven help us-
for only a miracle can save us

   oapeley started off on his snow-
shoes a day and a night passed-and
to the stalled train came no aid an-
other day another night passed and
nearly all hands were lying on the seats
and floors of the cars too weak to raise
a finger

cheyenne who happened to be in attend-
ance at the time had to cut em both off
another silence and more harkening
to the shrieks of the gale then again
from the indian agent

   which reminds me of billy the
bear-who through the same cause had
to get a union pacific railroad surgeon
to perform the same operation billy
the bear lost both feet and eight fingers
leaving him with only his thumbs

   the real name of billy the bear is
yeager hes living to-day at chadron
nebraska though he lost those append-
ages twenty-five years ago back in 

   for physical endurance and for
sheer pluck and will-power to survive
five days lost in a wyoming blizzard
billy the bear has held the record all
these years
riding the rail from coast to coast



   he was a cowboy on the bar m
ranch thirty miles from the tracks of
the union pacific at rock creek
wyoming our friend here from new
york meaning the writer says he
was at rock creek a couple of years ago
in a mild blizzard he has some idea
then of what it means to be in the rock
creek country in the worst blizzard
which the men of that region have ex-
perienced-the blizzard in which billy
the bear was lost for five days

-corner of thu stable

   one morning billys boss at the
ranch came to him saying  billy heres
a telegram for our owners at chicago
its of the utmost importance that they
get this message at the earliest moment
i want you to carry it to the railroad
station at rock creek and get the oper-
ator there to send it

    billy looked at the sky and at the
distant rockies and instinctively felt
that snow was about to fall heavily
nevertheless he saddled up believing
that he could outride the storm and
readtjhe railroad before nightfall

  talk about messages for garcia
billy the bear was just such a messen-
ger he didnt put in no buts nor ask
any questions nor express his opinions
regarding the weather he mounted aiid
loped away with the telegram and be-

   	r r

fore nightfall the blizzard overtook him
-and he had to sleep in the snow

   the next day and the next and for
four days he and his horse stumbled on
blindly through the gale of wind and the
blinding snow billy only guessing
where he could be

all but dead

   on the morning of the fifth day
billy and his cayuse were dragging
themselves along-all but dead in that
condition he came in sight of a log
cabin the home of a prospector whom
billy knew in sight of that haven
within sight of the smoke coming from
the chimney of the cabin-neither billy
nor his horse could go a step farther
the horse fell exhausted and so did
billy

   as he lay there helpless billy in-
stinctively took his gun from its holster
aimed at a tin bucket which he could see
standing on a bench outside the cabin-
door and fired

   billy made a good bulls-eye on the
bucket and out rushed the prospector
spied billy rushed to where he arid his
horse lay and managed to get them to
his cabin where he rubbed billys frozen
feet and hands with snow and cared for
the cayuse

   the next morning was bright with
sunshine - the blizzard had spent its
force though it was still bitterly cold
 i must deliver that telegram said
billy and despite the protests of his
host he compelled that gentleman to
strap him on his horse-and once more
away rode billy this time bound sure
enough for rock creek station which
was not many miles from the cabin

  that station as our new york
friend may recollect has a platform
built above the ground about on a level
with a horses back up to that plat-
form rode billy-and there he just
reeled sideways onto the platform
there the station-agent found him
strapped to his saddle the horse stand-
ing and billy unconscious-the telegram
grasped in his outstretched hand

  it was then that a union pacific
doctor took charge of billy and de-
prived him forever of both his feet and
his fingers leaving him only his thumbs
	the railroad mans magazine

the chief of police nabbed the fat stranger

and walked him double-quick back
to the depot

   billy drifted to chadron nebraska
-and there youll find him to-day a
prosperous merchant ask for mr
yeager the man who delivered the mes-
sage at a time when he should have
stayed in bed

idaho marys  pluck

  one- more story told by that indian
agent may well be included here it
is the remarkable story of a woman of
marvelous courage- idaho mary

  it was only natural that a man who
had lived so many years in close con-
tact with indians should entertain us
that night with all sorts of tales of red-
skins of the past and present after
no less than a half dozen brief recitals
of fights between the builders of the
union pacific railway and the indians
in wyoming the agent related his most
important and most thrilling tale of the
night

  well the most extraordinary of all
the indian fights here in idaho was the

one in which the heroine was
 idaho mary i knew  idaho
mary well she died-let me
see i should think about ten
years ago at nearly sixty-five
years of age - over at rocky
bar idaho i knew her as the
widow of colonel sexton whom
she married in very early life
but who died when mary was
somewhere in middle life

   colonel sexton was one of
the most respected settlers of
his day in idaho he was re-
 spected by indians as well as
whites - and thats saying a
lot for the redskins in those
days were particularly incensed
against the whites because of
the coming of the railway north
of salt lake

   the time came when the
warriors of chief gray wolfs
band took the war - path here
against any settlers whom they
suspected of having anything
to do with the railroad engi-
neers and others who were sup-
posed to be blazing a trail
through here for a railroad

   the indians knew that the
government had decreed that the union
pacific should run north of salt lake
but just exactly at what point the in-
dians did not know unfortunately just
at that time a sub-chief of gray wolfs
band named red rock happened to
find colonel sexton in camp with a num-
ber of white men who were looking for
a pass for a railroad through the moun-
tains

   red rock told gray wolf what he
had seen but gray wolf commanded
that colonel sexton be left in peace
it seems that red rock then got to-
gether nine bucks of the tribe and the
ten redskins then plotted the death of
the colonel and his wife

   going without war-paint in order
not to arouse the suspicion of gray wolf
and stating that they were starting on a
hunting trip they began a march of
thirty miles to the colonels home

  it so happened that on the day of
the arrival of the redskins on the colo-
nels claim the colonel himself was
twenty miles away in camp with the
riding the rai from coast to coast

railroad surveyors the trail which that
little band of white men was blazing at
that time is the very one followed to-day
by the oregon short line across idaho
from boise to pocatello

red rock and his bucks

   all alone at the sexton cabin was
mrs mary sexton the colonels wife-
when red rock and his nine bucks
loomed up as the redskins approached
something sneaky in their actions made
mary suspicious she went into her
bedroom where she quickly loaded a
revolver and hung it about her waist un-
der her apron the colonels winches-
ter rifle she also loaded and also placed
within reach yet out of sight behind her
bedroom door

   she saw the indians come to the
cabin-door and to her joy saw them
leave their guns outside-and take note
right here chat the indians weapons
were old muzzle-loaders as against
marys winchester and six-shooter

   the indians filed into the cabin
and found mary placidly sewing she
greeted them amiably but warily speak-
ing in their own language for she like
the colonel knew the red tongue

    red rock and his friends said the
leader  have come over the hills
from where the water flows to this
place where the fire-water flows

we have come to drink of the
strong water also he added
with a kind of growl  we want
meat

    shame on you  cried mary
sexton to come to a woman
for meat when game is plentiful in
the hills are you turned squaws

and fire-water away with you
my husband shall tell gray wolf
how you have broken the word he
passed to leave us in peace

    gray wolf has no ears and his
heart is as the chickens said red rock

 gray wolf does not hear that the great
white feather is sending the big noise
that goes without pony to scare away
the deer and the buffalo from our hunt-
ing-grounds

    but red rock has ears and he
hears the big noise coming red rock
has eyes and he sees your man powwow
with those who will bring the big noise
and so -here he unsheathed his hunt-
ing-knife- red rock has come to roast
you in the ashes of this wigwam and
after that red rock will slay your
man

   that was red rocks last earthly
word a shot rang out-red rock fell
dead at marys feet another shot and
another-and two more redskins fell
dead in the cabin

   in the society in which she moved
the redskin was never spoken of as he
was in the east as  lo the poor indian
mary knew that it was of no use to
argue with an indian save to engage
in an argument whereof the logic was
bullets

the fourth dropped

   mary seizing her winchester fol-
lowed them to the door and before the

he entered out of curiosity just to see what the place contained


the railroad mans magazine

redskins could level a weapon at her
killed her fourth man

   then followed what you might call
a general engagement with the exchange
of many shots-without even a wound
for mary just as she was about to fire
the last cartridge in her rifle she paused

   there were the three men bringing
the hay-to pile it against the cabin and
fire it she would be roasted alive to
attempt egress by either the door or the
window meant sure death by a bullet

   here was a situation to unnerve any
woman let alone one who was not five

instinctively suspecting that she had bet-
ter save that last shot for some crisis

   that crisis came just then one of
the indians flew at her with his knife
when he was within ten feet of her
mary keeled him over with her last shot
thus number five was slain

   the five remaining redskins now
split up into two parties two men
guarded the cabin-the one with a gun
leveled at the door the other with a
gun trained on the window the other
three began fetching hay from the corral

   this however gave mary a chance
to reload her weapon but then-what
here was the most serious plight she had
been in since that first moment when the
indians first filed into the cabin

feet in height and who weighed only a
hundred pounds but man was a quick
thinker she thought of the little win-
dow in the bedroom at the rear and
she flew to it and crawled through

   the first inkling the indians had
that she had got outside of the cabin
was when the one who was leading the
three carrying the hay fell dead in his
tracks mary was shooting from behind
a log fence at the corner of the cabin

   the death of the indian seemed to
disconcert the remaining four so unex-
pected was this new attack they beat
a hasty retreat mary kept her eyes on
them however as she could easily do
in that open country she knew indian
ways she knew that they would return
riding the rail from coast to coast



stealthily in the hope of catching her
off guard

   she was right she became con-
scious that one indian had vanished in
the brush the other three remained in
plain sight-probably as decoys it was
the one who had disappeared for whom
mary watched and
surely enough all of a
sudden a bullet tore its
way under her arm ma-
king a slight wound

   the puff of smoke
from the discharged
weapon was sufficient for
mary to locate her man

she dropped feigning
death - and the indian
who had fired the shot
from a ditch through
which he had crawled
near sprang up to signal
to his comrades

   he never made that
signal a shot from
marys rifle pierced his
heart

   the three remaining
redskins advanced reck-
lessly and desperately to
the attack as if bent upon
getting marys scalp in
sheer revenge they ran
forward till they reached
the shelter of the stabl
mary withholding her fire
till the right moment
should come in a few
minutes one of the in-
dians unwisely peered around the cor-
ner of the stable bang he fell
pierced through a lung so died number
eight

   only two remained fortunately for
mary those two were silly enough to
empty their guns at her as they started
on the rush so that upon leaving cover
they had no weapon to depend on but
their knives another of marys trusty
bullets sent the one to his happy hunting-
grounds the second turned to flee

   with that last man in sight mary
for the first time hesitated should she
shoot him in the back no she could
not would not but then came the
thought of her husband if she allowed
this man to live she would surely spare

a man who would kill her husband and
without further hesitation she shot him

   think of the scene confronting
colonel sexton when he returned to his
cabin that night in company with two
of the railroad surveyors and three in-
dians  here and there about the cabin
lay the bodies of seven
indians and inside the
little home the bodies of
three more and there on
the door - step sat mary
her winchester across her
knee her face as white as
a sheet but still nervy
enough to say

    colonel you may
cut ten more notches in
this gun

   and thats how mrs
mary sexton of rocky
bar idaho came to be
christened  idaho mary 
by chief gray wolf who
when he heard the story
presented her with the
ponies and guns belonging
to the indians she had
killed adopted her as his
sister and made her a
member of the tribe

   theres a pile of rocks
over there to-day that hold
up this sign 

 here occurred the fight in
which mary sexton wiped out
red rock and nine other indians
belonging to gray wolfs band 

  at pocatello baggage-
man ketchum filled out the check that
would set my bag down in salt lake
city meanwhile making these few re-
marks 

   say why dont you fellows give us
baggage-smashers a showing once in a
while we have our hairbreadth escapes
all the same as engineers no i dont
mean such things as being squashed
under an avalanche of trunks from an
overloaded truck i mean such things
as getting shot

   why it was only the other night
kenneth iiannum-thats the name of
the baggageman im talking about-was
unloading trunks from a truck those
trunks had just come in on the train
from walla walla pie came to a big

-buck young  thanks


the railroad mans magazine

iron-bound chesty piece of baggage that
weighed some more or less than a ton
lie just let it tumble from the truck

   say there was consequences right
then that made hannum make a noise
like a battle there was a report and
the ping of leaden death the next
thing ilannum knew blood was stream-
ing down his hand his coat-sleeve was
in rags and a crimson furrow ran up
his arm from the elbow to the shoulder
a bullet had struck his elbow and
plowed its way up his arm

the guilty trunk

  help yelled hannum some
one in that trunk there has got a bead

on me

    all hands at the station came flying
to  annums rescue smoke and flame
were issuing from a hole in the port-
side of the trunk in the gathering
crowd was a fat sleek man with pudgy
hands and a diamond as big as a chande-
lier glistening  one of his fingers
this man seeing some of the railroad
men attack the trunk with such weapons
as came to hand cried

    hey there-what you doing that
trunk belongs to me let it alone

  its yours is it yelled some of
the angry railroaders other bystanders
fell upon the fat man with the lust of
gore blazing in their eyes and the owner
of the trunk had to flee

   the mob chased him through the
railroad yard and then up the main
street no end of indignant citizens of
pendleton joining in the pursuit till
finally the chief of police loomed up
and made official inquiry as to all the
fuss

    he carries an arsenal of loaded
weapons in his trunk the crowd shouted
 and hannum at the depot has been
riddled with bullets

    thereupon the chief of police nabbed
the fat stranger and walked him double-
quick back to the depot where hannum
was found nursing his wounds there
too the chief found the guilty trunk
wide open and railroad men scattering
its burning contents to the four winds
while the depot-master displayed a forty-
five colts with every chamber loaded
excepting one

     look here chief cried the depot-
master  its your duty to arrest this
man

   and say that fat man with the
diamond left a little of his side-show
money in pendleton you bet in the
form of a fine there was not a living
baggageman in or around pendleton
who would check so much as a suit-case
belonging to that fat man

   one day a cowman well known in
big timber walked into the railroad
station and delivered to the agent a bag
to be expressed to a place in idaho
what value asked the agentt
  three thousand dollars

   that same night the shipper disap-
peared from big timber and did not
show up again for two weeks within
that fortnight news came that the stage
on which that bag was forwarded to the
station had been held up by a bandit who
took nothing but the bag in question

costly newspapers

   upon the reappearance of the ship-
per of the bag in big timber the ex-
press agent there heard that the shipper
had declared that he would claim three
thousand dollars to compensate him for
the loss of his bag the result was that
when the shipper showed up in the sta-
tion he was confronted by a square-
jawed agent who held a gun

    put up your hands buck young
thanks now will you be kind enough
to identify the bag you shipped that was
worth three thousand dollars

   with that the agent stood before
buck young the identical bag which he
had brought there to be expressed to the
idaho town is that your bag asked
the agent it  well then open it
buck young lowered his hands long
enough to do as bidden and the opened
bag revealed contents consisting entirely
cf old newspapers

    pretty high price for newspapers
mr young the agent said  that bag
you k from the stage when you held
it up was a decoy bag an exact duplicate
of your own with contents also dupli-
cated about face please and keep
your hands up till i deliver you to jail 
another story told by that wells
fargo man at pocatello was this
riding the rail from coast to coast



   the night-watchman on the oregon
short line was one riley one night in
april he entered an old unused outhouse
near the tracks-entered out of curiosity
just to see what the place contained he
found a much-worn package bearing a
wells fargo express company label

   the nest morning our agent in salt
lake mr carev was sitting in his office
when riley came in

    good mornin he said  mr
carey findings is keepings aint it when
no owner shows up in that case then
mr carey ill be resigning my job right
now because im worth three-hundred
-thousand-dollars sir

   mr carey pretended great serious-
ness and asked what rileys property
consisted of

    railroad bonds quoth riley
 here they are sir and he explained
how he found the bonds

   mr carey looked the bonds over
then said  yes riley findings is
keepings these bonds are your

   riley took his bonds home with him
hid them under his couch then went
forth to begin spending his fortune
late that afternoon he again dropped
into mr careys office saying

    now mr carey please tell me
who it is that i take the coupons to

    h just take them to anybody that
happens to strike your fancy replied
mr carey  ive wired our san fran-
cisco office about your bonds and learn
that they were shipped from frisco by
our company to salt lake with a view
to their sale here you will notice that
your bonds are those of a railroad in
hawaii well that railroad was never
built and the people who subscribed
money for the bonds got their cash
back

  got their money hack did they
cried the indignant watchman  well
whos to give me back the money ive
spent to-day on these bonds ive blown
in over five dollars well aint this
a- oh whats the use  

another tramp king

some of the tricks he works on conductors-task of getting free
transportation over the railroads

we thought when we became acquaint-
ed with a no l that we had dis-
covered or been discovered by the chief
tramp of trampdom but it seems we were
wrong we have by way of the si louis
post-dispatch the word of penn the rapid
rambler that he is the individual who can
lay claim to the honor and that any other
claimant is a faker a usurper and impostor

  penns real name is frank gr welch
he has been on the road since he was four-
teen and says he has traveled  miles
without paying one cent

  the story of how he tricks the innocent
unsophisticated conductors is enough to
bring tears here it is as the st louis
post-dispatch tells it

   he first announces casually that he will
be on his way to chicago and the reporter
asks him where he will get the money

    i make my own ticket he answered
how out of a hat-check i have trav-
eled one hundred and fifty times between
st louis and chicago  this trick which
 invented

  i go into the railroad-yard with over-
alls on and make my way to the train as
it stands in the shed as she pulls out i
get  the steps under the vestibule floor

  after the train pulls out of east st
louis and the conductor has picked up his
fares in the forward smoker and gone back
through the train  take off the overalls and
unlock the door of the vestibule from the
outside thats another of my specialties

    i know pretty nearly every conductor
that travels over the line i patronize and
his punch-mark  know what conductor is
going out and f fix tip a hat-check making
a close imitation of the punch-mark with a
pointed keen knife-blade

   after i open the vestibule-door i roll
up my overalls go into the car with the
check in my hat and lie down in a seat and
go to sleep with my hat over my eyes the
conductor going through sees the chicago
punch in the check and passes me all
night and in the morning i am in old chi
its as easy almost getting from chi to
n yawk

the railroad of to-day bears about the same relation to the railroad of
to-morrow as the newly quarried block of marble to the finished
statue our forefathers had all they could possibly do in blocking out
roughly the pioneer roads without any effort at  polishing them up

   while we i ave polished and polished we can ntfver effect the final
polish our railroads will never reach a stage of absolute perfection there
will always be room for improvement of some kind their wonderful
growth and progress demands it

why it is necessary to employ able men to think out schemes of
economy and how those schemes are put
into operation

y ke womans work of the ancient

 i	 proverb a railroad is never
done on the contrary
the problems confronting
jijgegms railroad managements are
always growing more for-
midable though their forms may change
in the beginning the great problem was
to build something that in some sort of
fashion would meet the growing need of
transportation from the very nature of
conditions everything had to lie done in
an experimental makeshift sort of fash-
ion but tliis did not mitigate the difficul-
ties that had to be overcome to arrive at
the railroad of to-day

 to the development of the railroad the
pioneer builders brought an amount of
energy enthusiasm daring enterprise

series began in the august  railroad

 and faitli in the future unparalleled in
 the worlds history so zealously did
 they play their part in construction that
 the second generation of railroad men
 found themselves confronted with the
 still more formidable problem of finding
 traffic enough to enable the lines already
 built to exist

    unlike any other business enterprise a
 railroad once completed cannot be aban-
 doned because it is unprofitable it is
 not merely a private undertaking it is
 a public work as well trains must con-
 tinue to run whether they earn interest on
 the bonds or not if they do not pay
 the traffic managers must give way to men
 who can make them pay

   in coping with the second phase of
 their problem railroad men played a

 mans magazine single copies  cents


mkn who    for costly ikifles



more important part in the development
of the nation than they have been given
credit for if it had not been for the
incredible labors of the railroad-traffic
builders the united states would be very-
far behind its present stage of evolution

   millions were lavished by the railroads
to create revenue-producing traffic in the
wilderness immigration agents scoured
europe and coaxed population over by
the hundred thousand

   then the railroads sent out instructors

	seed - corn specials and seed - wheat
specials to teach the farmers how to raise
bigger and better crops they sent
 good - roads  specials to teach tiie
farmers how to haul their improved crops
to the station economically they did it
in order that they might have more car-
loads of freight to haul but the policy
deserves none the less to be characterized
as practical philanthropy 

   scientists employed by the railroads
studied the natural resources of the
country discovered raw material avail-
able and told how this material could
best be manufactured

   representatives of the traffic depart-
ments hunted up small capitalists with a
knack for manufacturing and stuck right
to them until they were safely established
in factories along the line finally rate
clerks figured themselves into premature
baldness trying to concoct a tariff on the
products of the new factories which
would enable infant industries to grow

the second problem solved

   the fact that the railroads did all this
not for the sake of the trusts they were
creating but for a few extra car-loads of
high-class profitable freight detracts
nothing from the value of the service to
the country thus was the second great
problem of the railroads solved

   fortunately for the country the solution
business was decidedly overdone the
railroads were soon overwhelmed with the
traffic of their own creating this situa-
tion has brought out the third and final
phase of the railroad problem and now
the transcendent task confronting the
railroads is to improve their facilities
sufficiently to take care of the business
forced upon them

  in early days when each new utility

   had to be invented as the need for it was
recognized the only test was  will it
do now instead of seeking expe-
dients within their available means man-
agements are compelled to find scientific-
ally correct mechanism and method
regardless of first cost the rule of
thumb  longer answers it is not
enough merely to handle the business
offered  it must be handled well for the
sake of the stockholders quite as much
as for the well-being of the public

when he chemist talks

  the situation has placed a new auto-
crat on the transportation throne the
promoter with the constructive imagina-
tion and dauntless courage and the rnira-
cle-worker in finance have been obliged
to abdicate in favor of engineers and
chemists and other experts with myste-
rious initials affixed to their names

  when these learned gentlemen an-
nounce that such and such things must
be done because they know they are the
right things to do the directors dare not
talk back-they simply dig up the money

  from the spectators point of view the
solution of present-day problems is no
less pictureque than like achievements of
earlier days ior one thing the process
involves an exhibition of team-work on
a larger scale than has ever before been
attempted

  the magnitude and complexity of rail-
road activities by creating a necessity for
organization has developed to a remark-
able degreee itscapacity this capacity
has been taxed to the utmost in grappling
with the problems involved in reducing
railroading to a science while dealing
with its own peculiar perplexities in its
own way each line lends its unstinted co-
operation to all the others in mastering
their common difficulties

  specialists in each line have their own
national organizations which systematic-
ally take up and work out every question
great or small bearing upon their own
particular calling there is a long list
of the national organizations all hard-
working and very much in earnest such
as the engineering and maintenance of
way association the master car build-
ers association master mechanics as-
sociation and many others

-interests itself in every subject that
concerns railroads and seeks to coordi-
nate the efforts of all the other organi-
zations to the common good to make
sure that no vagrant idea escapes dele-
gates are sent to international railroad
congresses to round up any desirable
wrinkles that european experts may
chance to hit upon v

  never before have so many clever
brains so many skilled hands and so
much money been focused upon the at-
tainment of any single object as are now
engaged in trying to improve the rail-
roads of the united states tip to a point
that will enable them to handle the traf-
fic offered and perhaps make a little
profit in doing it

  in striving after the perfect railroad
the engineers quite properly begin with
the track which is literally and figura-
tively the foundation to the unprac-
tised eye the railroad track of to-day
looks the same as the track of a dozen
years ago moreover in all human prob-
ability the track of fifty years hence will
look just like the track of to-day

  as inventors have been wrestling with
the monorail ior three-quarters of a cen-
tury without producing any practical re-
sults it may safely be assumed that trains
will continue to struggle along indefinite-
ly on two rails and that those rails will
lie laid exactly four feet eight and a half
inches apart

track improvements

  rut appearances are proverbially de-
ceptive and nowhere more so than in a
railroad track great improvements have
been made in many details of the track
and still greater ones may be expected
in the future-for the one thing upon
which all engineers agree is that the best
of railroads is not as good as it might be

  perhaps some idea of the amount of
room for improvement in a tiling so
seemingly simpleias a railroad track may
be gathered from the fact that at its last
annual meeting the american engineer-
ing and maintenance of way association
instructed seventeen committees to inves-
tigate and report upon seventy-eight sub-
jects pertaining to the permanent way

  on a good track the traveler is scarce-
ly conscious of the curves and grades
over which he rides even if his atten-
tion was called to them he would be un-
able to perceive therein any possibilities
for spectacular achievements but if he
only understood that a reduction of
grades from  feet to the mile to  feet
would double the hauling capacity of the
locomotives reduce the number of trains
one-lialf and lop off one-fourth of the
cost of operation he might begin to take
notice

the engineers troubles

  if he further understood that a loco-
motive has to exert half a pound of its
meager tractive power per ton of load
per degree of curvature to drag its train
around curves and that assuming the
average cost of hauling a train one mile
to be  cents the straightening of each
degree of curvature means an annual
saving of  cents on each daily train he
would be still further qualified to under-
stand why the straightening of kinks
both horizontal and vertical is the big-
gest problem confronting railroads to-day

  the difficulties are by no means ended
when the large sums of money required
for the work are raised the engineers
have their troubles too sometimes it
takes years to find a practicable way to
eliminate a stretch of objectionable track
one of the greatest undertakings of the
kind yet accomplished was the rebuilding
of the southern pacific formerly the
central pacific and union pacific in
nevada and itali alone  was
spent in reconstruction by which  miles
in distance were saved while  de-
grees of curvature and  feet grade
rise were abolished part of the work
was done by building thirty miles of new
main line right through the middle of
ireat salt lake

  more millions were spent in reducing
curves and grades in wyoming while the
lane cut-off in nebraska recently com-
pleted saves another   miles in distance
and some very bad grades and curves
a single cut on the new line is i mile
long  feet deep and  feet wide at
the center

  the northwestern railroad a few
years ago spent a round million of dol-
men who hunt for costly trifles



lars to build  cut-off  miles long be-
tween boone and ogden iowa it saves
 miles reduced the total curvature from
 degrees to  degrees and reduced
the heaviest grade from  feet to  feet
per mile

studying the road-bed

  once a line is located the next point
to be considered is how to construct the
road-bed so as to make it render the best
service at the lowest cost that sounds
very simple but railroads do not find
it so

  after years of effort to solve the prob-
lem in actual service as it went along the
pennsylvania railroad decided that it
was not making satisfactory progress so
a special commissioner of maintenance-
of-wav engineers was appointed in 
to experiment with road-beds and fix a
standard fifteen miles of experimental
track were built in the two years devoted
to the study of the subject then the
commission made its report and the re-
construction of the great pennsylvania
system was begun in accordance with its
specifications

  drainage is the one great point on
which special stress was laid by the com-
mission for water is a railroads worst
enemy extremely wide ditches were
recommended and the sides of all slopes
are sodded or covered with vines to pre-
vent detritus from washing into the
ditches and filling them up large cast-
iron drain-pipes were to he placed under
the ballast at frequent intervals kach
mile of standard track is to have 
cubic yards of crushed-stone ballast to
keep it steady

  next to the reconstruction of the
trunk-lines on a standard that will make
the economic handling of traffic possible
the matter of maintenance is the most im-
portant problem connected with the per-
manent way this means the work done
by the humble section-boss and his gang
however obscure the section-boss may
seem in the eyes of the public he is a
very important man in the railroad or-
ganization

  under his orders one-sixth of the to-
tal cost of operating is expended and
upon his skill depends the ability of
trains to make time

  f h harriman knows how to appre-
ciate the section-boss in order to make
him satisfied with his lot and keep him
up to concert pitch the little wizard of
wall street has established two hundred
library centers  the harriman lines
from which an abundance of good books
and periodicals are circulated among the
section men on all the harriman lines

  one-of the seotion-bosss problems that
is causing his superior officers a vast
amount of worry is the matter of ties
fvery railroad in the land is making des-
perate efforts to solve the problem of tie
supply twelve different models of re-
enforced concrete ties have been tested
but none have fully met the requirements
steel ties of every conceivable pattern
have also been tried with but poor suc-
cess  while a dozen different methods of
treating wooden ties to preserve them
from decay are in use

  while one set of experts is grappling
with the tie problem another is trying
to find something better than the present
spike to fasten the rail to the tie re-
cent tests by a columbia university pro-
fessor demonstrated that a side pressure
of  pounds by the rail was suffi-
cient to cut off the head of a spike the
strength of spikes is therefore ample ex-
cept possibly under most extraordinary
circumstances

troubles of the spike

  the trouble with the spike is not that
it isnt strong enough to withstand the
shearing movement of the rails but that
it is a tie-destroyer it cuts and bruises
the tie and so hastens decay for this
reason there is a great deal of talk about
introducing the screw spike extensively
used in europe

  ever since the first railroad was built
the rail has been the most vexatious
problem with which engineers have had
to deal and it seems as far from a sat-
isfactory solution to-day as ever it was
no single detail in railroad construction
has been the subject of such heated con-
troversy as the shape and size of the rail
whole libraries have been written on the
theory of rail-making

  although the american railway as-
sociation has adopted certain specifica-
tions for steel rails and has recommend-


the railroad mans magazine

ed their adoption the controversy is by

	means settled but the distinctions
in specifications between the most widely
different types of rail are altogether too
line for the lay mind to grasp

  the pennsylvania railroad is obliged
to use  tons of rails every year
for renewals as this involves approx-
imately  the company is nat-
urally anxious to reduce this item if
possible as rails wore out first at the
ends which were battered down by the
wheels of passing trains it was the cus-
tom to take up the rails at the end of
their average service of ten years cut off
about is inches from each end at a cold-
sawing plant redrill holes for angle-iron
bolts and relay on branch lines where
they would last another ten years

  as this was only half the service a good
rail should render a corps of engineers
was set to work to make a systematic
study of the problem nine years ago
copies of the patents for the  differ-
ent kinds of rail-joints offered by indus-
trious inventors were procured and care-
fully examined

  of the lot six of the most promising
were selected and introduced in sections
of experimental track these various
joints are now being tried out in actual
service and the one that makes the best
showing at the end of ten years will be
adopted as the pennsylvania standard

economy in fence-posts

  in a business where thinking is done
exclusively in millions there are no tri-
fles problems that might seem inconse-
quential to the outsider involve results
that are rather startling for instance
the proper distance between fence-posts
would seem to be a matter more worthy
the attention of a small farmer than that

    the next article in this series is also
subject of motive power

of the high-salaried director of operation
and maintenance of the harriman lines

  yet that capable official took time to
observe that the fence-posts along the
lines under his charge were one rod apart
while two rods would answer equally as
well if his order to set fence-posts two
rods apart instead of one rod were to
be applied to the  miles of railroad
more or less under the harriman influ-
ence it would effect a saving of some-
thing like  a year on renewals of
fence-posts which is equivalent to five
per cent interest on 

  railroad fence costs all the way from
 to  a mile at the average
of these extreme prices it would cost
 to fence all the railroads in
the united states

the woodpeckers ravages

  not the least of the trifles that are
great things is the woodpecker problem
in the south and southwest the wood-
peckers alight on the telegraph-poles
and upon hearing the humming of the
wires jump at the conclusion that some
particularly fat and luscious worms must
be at work inside the poles thereupon
they set to work to dig them out they
dont get the worms but they do run the
cost of renewing telegraph-poles up to
appalling proportions

  in california arizona and texas
fifty per cent of the poles are riddled so
that they are dangerous for linemen to
climb and they go down with the first
wind-storm one inspector in california
found  poles with  to  holes
bored in each by the woodpeckers along
the illinois central in tennessee   of
 consecutive poles were so badly rid-
dled by woodpeckers that they had to be
replaced

a bo

and a bulldog

by emmet f harte

stealing a bulldog from a baggage - room
doesnt always lead to the paths of glory

fie fact that i sat dozing in
the shadow of a ram-
shackle corn-crib at york
nebraska does not signify
that i was ditched be-
cause i wasnt i was
doing window-glass signs at the time in
that sectionof the state and had cleaned
up a very genteel little stake at that par-
ticular county seat

  under such circumstances youd think
i would have bought a ticket for grand
island whither  was bound and rode
in on the red plush along with the law-
abiding and otherwise uninteresting
traveling public-but not me a minion
of the b and m once swindled me out of
two dollars due for arduous labor as a
section-hand under the rules and regula-
tions down at red cloud

  in redress thereof i dont pay over no
money of mine to that company for rail-
road fare i bide my time until the ef-
facing shadows of nightfall envelop the
surroundings and then effect a hiatus per
the blind the trucks or the breeze-fanned
pullman-roof and save my money

  thus true to conviction and un-
harassed by either hunger conscience or
weather i sat nodding until four hours
should elapse and the west-bound train
should potter along as scheduled there
always intrudes a note of discord how-
ever into every serene and poetic lan-
guor of mine

  a local rattled in a while before sun-
down a local pulled by an antiquated
din-maker rigged with a blower and they
coughed buzzed and sputtered around
there switching up and down past my
shed for half an hour making much dis-
turbance of my peace finding finally
that i couldnt sleep i sat up looked

about me and there not ten feet away
 saw fitz souders in the company of a
white bulldog the two of them engaged
in the eating of a pie

  ive known fitzhugh souders for
years and years but the bulldog was an-
entire stranger fitz is a bo of the un-
abashed stripe a few of us pretend to
have some means of support he dont

  fles hobo true to name and war-
ranted flotsam pure and simple and not
ashamed to approach the grandest dame
that ever made swishing sounds along a
cement sidewalk in the garish light of
high noon to ask genially for a dime or
a quarter i threw in my clutch and
honked over to renew affiliations

   well well  he said in recognition
 wich way bo whod have thunk
it have a piece of pie its pumpkin
thanks i said  im headed for
grand island whered you get hola
of the pup

   that he remarked  is another
story sit down and make yourself at
home happen to have any makings
ah- a pause silence broken by the
snuffling of a nose the hurried exhaust
of the frcight-engine kicking a car off
some distance away the crash of draw-
heads when it hit a fellow victim then
fitz struck a match lit up and resumed
 fles an english bull thoroughbred
pedigree from a to izzard with a line of
ancestors to make our great american
first families sky-blue with envy look
at him dont he show up select 

   hes stumbled into grievous bad
company  commented

  true tis tis pity pity tis tis
true  quoted fitz unruffled  but it
might be worse in fact it has been
worse as i was goiri to tell


the railroad mans magazine

   you ought to seen the bunch that had
him in tow when i got him box-car
thieves depot-sneaks and suit-case-lift-
ers that was the kind of company he
was in then and a kick in the slats when
he didnt wag his tail to suit eh
bench  

  the dog flicked his ears and turned an
adoring eye in fitzs direction

   it was down in st jo continued
the narrator jesse jamess town a
tolerable - like village with aspirations
and boastful of being the healthiest
speck on the map but smudged with some
of the worst two-for-a-nickel thieves
from sioux city to st louis

   i hung around there almost a week
the coppers are an easy-going lot of
peace-promoters having a grudge at only
two kinds of people namely gun-tooters
and lid-lifters

   once in a great while they catch a
stick-up artist or a porch-climber just to
show their versatility or a cycle-sleuth
chases an automobile up a telephone-pole
or into the river for exceeding six miles
an hour but on the whole st jo isnt
boisterous

   its river-front and frame-shanty
districts are as i said before pretty con-
siderably frequented by a class of light-
fingered gentry however who steal eve-
rything they can from the railroads from
the coal that scatters off in the yards to
the wheels off of the passenger-coaches
there was a regular gang operating in
and around the place

   they would secrete themselves into
box cars of merchandise in the yards
then when the train pulled out through
the edge of town theyd slide the door
open and heave out caddies of tobacco
cases of canned goods cigars tomato-cat-
sup shoes bananas kegs of bad booze
and bales of cotton piece to be picked
up by other members of the association
who were waiting for that purpose and
hauled to town in a wagon

   easy wasnt it huh it was like
gathering manna on a bumper-crop year
of that commodity it was a cinch 

  all this i found out later i stum-
bled on the thing by accident-as good a
way as any i guess

   i was loafing on a hickory settee op-
posite the haggage-room of the union sta-
tion one dusk arguing with myself

whether to go to omaha or k c when

	saw a man frisk this pup here from the
baggage-room and make his getaway with-
out a soul seeing him but me i do believe
the dog was tethered to the handle of a
trunk by the door and the party with
the sticky fingers just sidled along
clipped the cord and slipped across the
street between a trunk-van and a street-
car leading the dog ducked into a cross
street and did the vanishing skiddoo

   i whipped up and took his trail it
wasnt hard to follow the guy a blind
man could have done it lie went to-
ward the river a ways then he turned
and took down the terminal tracks along
the bank

   i kept him in sight until he finally
went into a house somewhere down south-
east of the bridge then i sized up the
same as to locality and general aspects
so id be able to find it again if neces-
sary

   i went back the way i had come
concluding to stay over another night
the morning papers would probably
have an ad in the lost and founds
ten dollars reward for the return of a
white bull pup and no questions asked
wich would look good to me

   i had an inkling in my own mind
as to what id do if such proved to be
the case while i was going along cogi-
tating with myself about the matter i
fell in with another bo he was a
stranger to me though he was evidently
an old-timer in the profession for he was
seedy sloppy and shy several shaves

    sy friend he said  cd yeh stake
meh to a match  - i could would and
did in return for the favor he asked
about freight-trains outgoing north east
south and west he wasnt seemingly
particular about wich way he went

   youve got me faded i told him

 i only ride passengers no freights for
mine i couldn t tell you within six
hours of the leaving time of any one of
them because i dont know

   that seemed to interest him consid-
erably lie studied it over then we
talked on a while about this that and
the other and the first thing i knew the
man was pumping me

   quite a sweater he was too doing it
in a roundabout way mixed in with other
conversation of no moment and a few
a bo and a bulldog	

stories strictly new clean and well told
as soon as i tumbled to the catechism
game i played dead and told him the
history of somebody elses life acknowl-
edging the same modestly as mine we
went over and sat on the river-bank and
made friends each with each quite chum-
my and good-humored for two
hours or more

   the upshot and outcome of
my nice little story of hard luck
which he snaked out little by lit-
tle was that he told me his name
and address and also revealed
his line of business

 q detective andy

night after night between st jo and
rushville on the south and amazonia on
the north keeping both eyes peeled for
the thieves it would give him more time
to watch the yards

 it was strictly a commission con-
tract he said  catch-a the tief no

he

us

bver

as

whod have thunk it have

his handle and he needed some assist-
ance he said to get a line on a bunch
of box-car robbers who were doing a
land-office business in that community

  night after night cars were broken
into either at thefreight-houses or in the
yards and stuff of all kinds carried off
it was getting fierce-the company was
getting about all they wanted of it

   i suggested that maybe employees of
the road themselves were doing the frisk-
ing but he rather thought not as he said
he had been watching the daily life and
habits of every man and his family to
the third and fourth generation who ever
even applied for a job with their com-
pany no he thought it was a gang of
home-talent pilferers who did but little
else and had it down to a fine system

   what he wanted me to do was this
if i would beat my way back and forth

   	rr

a piece of pie its pumpkin

rnake-a the mon but if i happened to
get next to a clue that would lead to the
identity of the rascals hed undertake to
say that the company would do the right
thing by me

   i didnt much like the idea of riding
freights but there was nothing else for it
so i hired to him for a week and got my
assignment-a train then making up in
the lower yards for the southwest it
was a clear warm night - only three
weeks ago you know-we drilled over
and took a prospect along the train for
broken seals or suspicious characters loi-
tering around if we could find any at
the same time keeping out of the sight of
railroad employees

   everything looked ail correct and
regular we examined every car noth-
ing doing

   byers told me where  could find


the railroad mans magazine

him if anything turned up and rambled
for the hannibal yards to inspect a train
going out over there i ensconced my-
self in an empty on a parallel track then
and did some heavy sleuthing

  fitz souders secret service that
was me and aunt annie didnt i
have the good luck that night

   why bo it was all cut and hung on

the line for me it was too nice for
anything

   when the train started i slipped out
of the empty and slid in under a car
and ill make you a jurat that we didnt
go a distance of twenty car lengths until
a man hopped up out of the lark onto
the very car i was stowed away under
and began to juggle with the door by
moving along the rods a few feet i could
have reached out and grabbed him

   he clung on while they were creep-
ing out of the sidings and then he drew
up his legs and disappeared i guessed
he had got the door open and crawled in-
side great business wasnt it

   all i had to do was watch out for
the first package that bumped the ballast
if he threw anything out get off and
camp by it till somebody came after it
then see where it went if he didnt
throw anything out then i would simply
go on and on to see what he did do it
was an easy voyage either way for hawk-
shaw souders

   along down the bottom a little
ways below the yard-limit post my pirate
began to get busy he heaved out a box
of canned tomatoes or lemon extract or
something and the minute  heard it
bump the gravel  gathered myself to-
gether to follow it

   ever get out from under a box car
going a pretty good hickory its hard
on the features i guess that train wasnt
running over twelve or fifteen miles an
hour as they had a fair string of loads
and only one engine but  plowed up
the road-bed with my nose just the same

    tried to light clear of the ballast
and did all spraddled out in the raspiest
a bo and a bulldog

lot of weeds i ever mowed didnt
break anything though by good for-
tune so  crawled a little farther into
the tall timbers and laid low

   the pick - up party must have
been ready and waiting for it wasnt
more than five minutes before two fel-
lows came sneaking along the side of the
track looking for spoils hist-sh-sh
sherlock that was me drectly they
came back carrying a box between em
and  slipped along behind on their trail

   there was a wagon road a short dis-
tance back and there they had a horse
hitched to a delivery wagon waiting i
burrowed under a near-by culvert and
hid while they loaded up the rest of the
stuff

   the fellow who had thrown the loot
out of the car evidently got off himself
with the last box for there were three of
them when they finally drove off i
hope he had better luck getting off than
 did if he didnt he lost some hide
ill bet

   i loped out after them when they
started keeping far enough behind to
be out of sight in the darkness and close
enough to not lose them they didnt
go up through south town they went
round back of the packing-houses along
a by-road through the river-bottoms stri-
king the end of south fourth street
we didnt meet very many people and
it was dark enough so that what few we
did meet didnt likely see me and i
never lost that grocery wagon not for one
minute

   try dog-trotting six miles over a
country road once phew hawkshaw
was pretty much all in when they landed
up at last in an alley quite a ways up in
the village but it was great sleuthing
for an amateur fine 

   and say where do you think they
stopped  it was the same place the guy
had sloped to with the white dog

   i was just naturally too tired to
wiggle my little finger when i got that
far and the thought of drilling away
beyond sixteenth street to see byers and
report was beyond me i couldnt do
it at least not then and i didnt have
the price of a car ride

   the chances were that he wouldnt
be there anyhow so i dragged myself
over in the lee of a foundry or some-

thing close by made me a bed on some
scrap-iron and went to sleep

  did i sleep huh it was sun-
up when i woke up i had quite a nap
and  was so stiff and sore that i
squeaked and whined in the joints like a
load of wood in arkansas

  aunt annie railroad detecting is
wearing on the human frame  was
flat broke and hungry as wolves and she-
liears but i crippled over to byerss
boarding-house and they said he was
there but had gone to bed

    said i had important news from
the front and demanded entrance 
suppose they thought t was a black-
hand envoy from the looks of me but
they finally permitted me to go up to
his room byers himself didnt know
me at first as i had disguised myself in
the face considerably when i fell off the
train but he got a shove on himself
when he heard me tell my little story

   i related the whole thing including
the stealing of the dog wich he hadnt
heard about before and it made a hit
with him throughout

  thats the checker he said roll-
ing out and getting into his clothes
 well go right over and pinch the whole
works youre there in a thousand dif-
ferent places bully

    here now i said somewhat rau-
cous what do you think i am a tin
soldier how much breakfast do you
think ive had and how much money
do you think ive got i turned my
pockets inside out tij demonstrate my
embarrassed condition financially and he
rallied like n man coming out of a stage
faint

    etta he bellowed down the stair-
way  get this man a square meal on the
table about as quick as you ever did any-
thing in your life and send the kid to
the saloon after a can that was
sounding something more like it then he
said to me

    by george i never thought but
what youd had your breakfast youll
have to excuse me this time

   i couldnt do otherwise and ill let
you guess what i did to that breakfast
and that bucket of beer afterward i
felt different

   we took a car for police headquar-
ters and got a couple of plain-clothes
	the railroad mans magazine

cops to help round-
up the pirates i
piloted the party
to the place and
we descended from
all directions at
once on the said
stronghold of law-
lessness

 what do you
think we captured

huh nothing but
an old w oman
blind in one eye

v--j

who took on most pitiful said she was
a poor widow and had only one son who
worked for the street-railway company
laying track

    we ransacked the house from cellar
to shingles and the only thing we found
was the white bulldog tied in the coal-
shed he was black and blue from kicks
and cuffs and the old woman said he
had come there several days before as a
stray

   her son wanted to keep him for a
watch-dog she said as theyd been los-
ing their coal out of the shed the
whole neighborhood gathered around as
is iisaal and testified to the old womans
tale and said slighting things about the
mullet-headed minions of the law in gen-
eral for descending on a poor widow
woman in any such fashion

   the plain-clothes men began to look
sideways at me like they thought i was

a candidate for the
insectoriuin and if
it hadnt been for
the bulldog it
w oud nt have
taken much argu-
ment to con-
vince me id
dreamed the
whole plot my-
self there wasnt a
tiling the least bit
suspicious even

any w ay we
took the dog and
went over to the
union station
had they lost a
white bull pup 
you bet they had

he belonged to
miss gladiola go-
diva of the blue-
b e   burlesquers
and according to reports already received
there had been a row when he showed up
missing he was a registered dog with
a pedigree as long as a dry sunday
worth mints of money they said and
were awful much obliged for him being
returned

 but the cops said no he might be
needed for evidence against the thieves
so theyd better take him to the station
and consult the chief first in the mean-
time the railroad company could wire the
young lady and let her know about it if
they so desired there wasnt any harm in
that

   on the way to the police-station i
made friends with the dog it was a
case of affinities with him and me love
at first sight

   while the cops were out looking for
the son that worked on the street rail-
way byers and i loafed around the sta-
tion and  doctored the bulldog up with
some liniment for his bruises and rustled
him some bones to gnaw thats the way
to get on the oozy side of man or beast
get em something to eat

   when they finally brought in the
fellow we were waiting for the white
dog and i were side partners you
ought to have seen him growl and show
his teeth at the guy it was plain that
he didnt like him

it was great

sleuthing for
an amateur
a bo and a bulldog



    as for me id never seen the fellow
before he wasnt one of the three in
the grocery wagon i could swear to
that neither was he the rooster that
swiped the dog from the jjaggage-room

i told them so as soon as they brought
him in

   under the circumstances they
couldnt do anything else but turn the
fellow loose after asking him la few
questions his version of how he got
the dog tallied with his mothers story
straight enough so they let him go

   byers hadnt been mixed up in it
at all while they had the man under fire
hed kept himself out of sight so when
the fellow walked out of the station
byers sauntered after him giving the
rest of the push the wink

    as for me i didnt know just ex-
actly what to do next myself it was
considerably past eat-time  was broke
and nobody seemed to be fall-
ing over themselves to invite me
out to lunch

   i was getting more dis-
gusted every minute finally
 got up to take a saunter out
into the residence district on a
small matter of business when
i heard the desk-cop talking to
somebody over the phone

    says he dont want the
dog eh  - oh her husband

i see dyou fellows want him
down there no weve got
no use for him i dont know
about that no yes well
all right then he turned
around to me and seeing i was
interested said

    they got a wire from
that showgirls husband and
he says hes glad the dogs
lost hopes hell stay lost

says his wife hasnt got the
slightest use for a dog any-
how and hes more bother
than hes worth

     he asks us to ditch him
on the quiet and hell consider
it a favor the baggage out-
fit dont want him nor any-
body around here so i guess
its the soap grease for his

  give him to me i said he d
 ill take him

  sure thing he said gladly take
him along and welcome and thats
how  happened to have another mouth
to feed in my family

   bench was the name engraved on
his collar and he wagged his piece of
a tail when i called him by it and went
with me like hed already made up his
mind about the matter we drifted out
around town a while acquiring thirty-
five cents in real money during the same
by means of the usual confidences con-
fided to the right parties some gave up
easy an some didnt

   then we entered the odoriferous
confines of a chile-bazaar and once more
stayed the maddening pangs some-
where along about six oclock we ran
across byers

 ive been looking
for you man he said

 all over town
  whereve you

been  howd you vamose with the dog 

 it simply to get square for a few kicks
 hed received previously


the railroad mans magazine

   i told him how it was and asked
for news nothing doing

    i followed that man all afternoon
he said  and by george if hes crooked
lies a slick one first he went home
and had his dinner he was still there
when the one-oclock whistles blew so
 supposed lie wasnt going to work in
the afternoon

    i had it sized up that hed slip
some word to the gang if lies mixed up
in it in any way so i hung around in the
neighborhood he came out finally and
slouched over to sixth street to a saloon
where he loafed the rest of the time
playing cards with the bunch of rounders
that hang out there nothing suspicious
about that it looks like lies what he
claims to be

    you go ahead with your regular
work around the yards i said to byers
 and ill camp on the trail of these peo-
ple ive got nothing else to do i
know thats where the wagon stopped
that night at least

    and by the way i mentioned
casually  you couldnt loan a poor devil
a dollar could you till pay-day this
detecting business is the most appetizing
line ive been in lately

    ill make it a five he said grin-
ning   and good-by if i never see you
again

   i suppose he thought that with
that much money in my possession i
wouldnt lose any time catching a
steamer for europe or some other sea-
port for the idle rich

    good-by i said  leave your
address so i can write you the particu-
lars when i jug the pirates

   bench is the boy that really did the
work though and he did it simply to
get square for a few kicks hed received
previously that same night about mid-
night we two of the secret service were
nosing around in the alley back of the
place under suspicion when bench be-
gan to growl

   he didnt bark i should say not
lies got too good blood in him for that
he just bristled up his bristles and
rumbled in his chest and prowled off up
the alley

   i chased along behind him and
three back yards away he slid under
the fence and pounced onto a man who

was drawing some water out of a well
there was a succession of noises growls
curses and grunts and i hurried
through the gate to pull the dog off

   i thought he was overdoing the
sleuthing business a little just then
another guy came out of the kitchen
door of the shanty and in the light
from a lamp inside wich streamed out
i recognized him as one of the pirates
in the wagon id followed up-town the
night before

   what do you think before i even
stopped to consider the consequences i
bustled up and swung at the fellows
head and ill never tell the truth again
as long as i live if i didnt catch him
just right and down he went like a
log id knocked him out

   aunt annie wouldnt that give
you a start i didnt stop at that
though i sailed right into the other
one and bench and i between us had
him down and begging for mercy in
short order

   he was a good deal -too noisy about
it so i choked him till his tongue stuck
out i took it for granted that there
wasnt any more of em in the house
or theyd have come out by that time
so between bench and me we dragged
and worried the guy into the kitchen
where the first thing t saw was a piece
of rope clothes-line with which i tied
his hands and feet not until he was
tied good and solid did that persevering
dog let up chewing on him either and
him bawling murder

    then i left bench lickine his chops
and standing guard while i went out
and brought in the other victim him
i roped up also and the trick was done
slick work wasnt it  hawkshaw soud-
ers to the good modest blushes

   the place was a two-room shack
with not much furniture in it a wooden
bedstead a table made out of a goods-
box a coal-oil lamp and some rickety
chairs there was a thirty-two caliber
revolver on the table and what was left
of a can of beer

   i attended to both then i searched
the pirates they didnt have much on
them some small change pocket-knives
and makings for cigarettes

   i was up against it now after id
caught the rascals i was afraid to
a bo and a bulldog	

l left bench licking his chops
and standing guard

leave them to go after a cop and afraid
to start with them to the station for fear
theyd get away

   i knew  couldnt hit the side of a
warehouse with a pistol and they looked
mighty good to me tied hand and foot
after id cooled down a bit mighty
good

  we didnt hold any conversation
the only thing said was after the one
id slugged woke up and began to enjoy
himself once more by looking around-
the one bench had it in for-and re-
marked 

ten more and theyll eat the said ila-ik-
shaw and his dog bench alive

  sneaked to the window and looked
out it was as dark as black cats and
 couldnt see but one man he was
just coming in

 i shoved bench back with my foot

    i wish id a killed that dog last
night instead of listenin to you an sam

  aha so sam wasnt so innocent
after all sam was the old womans
son that was all that was said they
just looked the rest of the time bench
laid himself down contentedly and went
to sleep

  about three oclock somebody drove
up out in front with a wagon kind of
quietly the pirates heard it and ex-
changed looks

    its all off now i thought to my-
self  here comes probably eight or

and laid low behind the door with the
gun when the guy lifted the latch
both of the pirates in the kitchen sung
out to him to look out but it was too
late too late for the newcomer for
id already whanged him across the coco
with the barrel of the pistol and down
he went like a steer under the hammer

   i must have been pretty scared and
hit him a little too vicious for it took
the city physician the biggest part of
the next day to bring him out of it
i didnt take any risks then though
i tore up a sheet and tied him up too
the railroad mans magazine

   in mussing up the bed thereby i
found some of the loot silks and laces
and things stowed under the covers
there were also several cases that looked
like canned goods on the floor under-
neath i had the right parties all right
you bet

   along about then i had an idea
and before it got cold i put it into ex-
ecution id load up the works andtake
em in the wagon to the police-station

   before i had time to think it over
and back out i had muzzled the three
with rags tied around their faces to keep
them from yelling and disturbing the
neighborhood and had two of em load-
ed on then i put bench on the wagon-
seat to stand guard while i got the last
victim and what odds and ends of the
plunder i could load up in a hurry

   were they surprised to see us when
we drove in to headquarters aunt an-
nie  you ought to have seen em

   it aint often that somebody drives
up with a wagon-load of pirates all tied
and muzzled that he has caught with
the assistance of a lone bulldog i was
considered the prize-winning flool for
luck either that or a thief-catcher

   when the news reached byers he
wouldnt believe it but when they went
over to the shanty and found a cellar
full of robbers loot he thought it was

about the hottest catch of the season
the guy who had brought the wagon
turned out to be a fellow that operated
a small store and had always been con-
sidered respectable he disposed of the
most of the stuff at regular prices and
they had been enjoying quite a nice busi-
ness

   theyre all three in the hoe business
now down at jeff city the old woman
and her son sam couldjit be proven
guilty of any part in it and if there
were any more of the pirates they got
away

   we got thtee of them and scared
off the rest byers put it pretty strong
to the company i guess for they came
back as substantial as i could have ex-
pected and then some

   they also offered me a steady job
sleuthing and i took em up thats
what im doing now together with-
bench here

   bench can smell a crook across a
country shake hands with bench soud-
ers late of the bluebell burlesquers

  i made overtures to pat the white bull-
dog on the head at which his bristles
rose noticeably and he mumbled some-
thing in his throat

   excuse me  i said with some
trepidation  i think i hear mv train
coming i reckon id better be hiking

an overworked engine

engine capacity is a wonderful thing
and is by some cynical railroad offi-
cials believed at times to have a more or
less direct proportion to an engineers capac-
ity at least this was so in the old days
doubtless the belief is worn out by now
illustrating the one-time justice of its ex-
istence an official of the rock island tells
a story

  the incident happened several years ago
on a line of road near port arthur texas
there was a very heavy grade in this stretch
of track and the company had rated the
engines at six hundred tons over bis grade
tlie engineers said this rating was all right
but that the engines positively would not
handle more than the rated load

  one night a freight conductor on a north-
bound was ordered to take along sixteen flat
cars from the division station to a stone
quarry twenty-five miles up the line this
would increase the tonnage over the rated

capacity of the engine and would compel the
crew to double the grade before the train
got under way however an order came
canceling the previous one and the flats
were uncoupled

  tlie engineer did not know of this last
order and lie dragged the train along and
finally stalled claiming that his tea-kettle
could not pull the extra empties the con-
ductor went forward and told him in eng-
lish french german and apache that he
was not pulling any extra load and if he
didnt get her under way quicker than a
hop skip and a jump thered be things doing
when they pulled in

  the engineer gave her a jerk from a dead
standstill on the grade that pretty near car-
ried her in one jump over the mountain
then he let her rip he had loafed around
and wasted half an hour but he made
the division station ten minutes ahead of
schedule
 pathways of the wheel

by george hebard paine

wheels came long before steam to drive them and with wheels came
roads even the crudest cart rumbling along on cross-sections of
tree-trunks required a better track than the path for foot-travelers
or the trail that the horsemen followed

    rome the great pioneer in many tilings first saw the need of roads
and her highways are still unequaled many of them still exist after nearly
twenty centuries of use we in this country are in our infancy as road-
builders but we are learning meanwhile it is profitable even for railroad
men to know something of what the world has done to make smooth the
pathway of the whirling wheel

the romans built the first and greatest roads macadam led the
way in england and we in this country are
learning from our mistakes

and post roads whose total length was
many tens of thousands of miles but we
can only guess at the number of the
branch routes for commercial use con-
structed under local auspices

  when it is remembered that the hand
of romes authority was felt throughout
spain portugal france belgium a
large part of the netherlands and ger-
many  in switzerland austria hungary
the balkan states and turkey-even into
persia arabia syria and the whole
northern part of africa-and that in all
of these places she had direct routes of
well - built highways something of the
truth may be realized



e carthaginians made high-
ways through spain and
across the pyrenees and the
ancient egyptians hauled
the material fcr their huge
monuments over stone cause-
ways  but the first great road-makers of
the world were the engineers of the im-
perial city on the tiber indeed romes
wonderful system of communications was
essential to her power her roads were
the arteries of an empire which could
not have existed without them

  the full extent of the roman high-
ways can never be known we have a
fairly complete record of the military


the railroad mans magazine

  further consider that in most of
these lands she found an almost track-
less wilderness inhabited by skin-clothed
savages of the stone age that when her
empire fell she left them well advanced
toward civilization and that she did all
i his largely because she built roads
what a lesson it teaches

roads built for all time

  the roman road was not an acci-
dental track a quagmire in the spring
and autumn and a stretch of choking dust
in summer such as prevails to-day over
the greater part of this enlightened land
it was a carefully surveyed route with
the easiest grade that the country would
allow and was constructed of perma-
nent materials in a permanent manner
the engineers of the caesars were not
graduates of technical schools but they
knew the constructive value of broken
stone gravel clay and cement and how
to use each material to advantage

  like her laws her literature and her
architecture romes highways were not
made for a day but for all time their
prime purpose was a military one-to
keep her legions in uninterrupted com-
munication for mutual support and for
the gathering of supplies subsequently
when the pax romana was secure they
served other uses - those of the postal
service and of commerce

  permanent stations at conventional
distances were established through their
length these were originally military
posts but were gradually converted into
halting-places for travelers and centers
of trade and population a fixed num-
ber of horses and carts for the public
service and for hire was maintained by
the state at each post that this whole
magnificent organization should have
disappeared from the face of the earth
for a period of twelve hundred years
shows to what a depth of degeneracy the
people of europe descended during the
dark ages

  in road-building the roman engineers
began at the beginning - the founda-
tion upon a suitable bed at times
excavated to a depth of three feet they
laid large stones closely packed together
and hammered tightly into place this
was the universal method  but above the

foundation the construction varied with
the location with the amount of traffic
which the road must carry and with the
materials available

  a common plan was to cover the first
course of large stones with a layer of
clay and gravel then a layer of nearly
pure clay and then as a wearing sur-
face coarse gravel approximating to
cobblestones in size when such ma-
terials were at hand the foundations were
often set in something resembling hy-
draulic cement and the wearing surface
was sometimes treated in the same way
but always the structure was made im-
permeable to moisture it was rounded

	the top and the rainfall was taken
away in a large ditch blocks for
mounting horses were often provided 
the berm the shoulder of the ditch
formed by heaping earth or stones into
a pile

pavements as good as the best

   i	cities where the traffic was heaviest
and most concentrated roman pave-
ments are found covered with sized
stones as a wearing surface which are
models of good workmanship not so
smooth perhaps as the average city
pavement of to-day but far better con-
structed and infinitely superior to the
cobblestones which were so common in
american cities a few years ago the
blocks of which these pavements were
formed were from twelve to fifteen
inches square and were often-laid diag-
onally to the direction of the traffic to
reduce the wear  the edges of the
stones and to minimize the shocks to
passing wheels	

  the first great revival of road-build-
ing in europe came with napoleon one
of the greatest organizers of history
to be sure there were sporadic instances
thirty or forty years earlier in england
and scotland where the most highly
enlightened people seem to have begun
to find the conditions of travel intoler-
able novels and letters of the latter
half of the eighteenth century bristle
with accounts of the badness of the
highways in great britain and all over
the continent

  switzerland too had paid a little at-
tention to the subject at about the same
pathways of the wheel



period but the first large work of the
kind was napoleons reconstruction of
the simplon military route into italy
here was truly a strange piece of re-
tributive justice a man of italian blood
builds roads to carry the tricolor into the
territory of his ancestors just as those
ancestors built roads to carry the roman
eagles into france two thousand years
before

  in the year  the stage-coach was
still the slow and lumbering affair of the
previous century not the flier of twenty
years later drawn by thoroughbreds at
twelve or fifteen miles an hour ladies
in london or paris were still carried to
balls and routs in sedan chairs and the
modern rule that a gentleman who walks
with a lady shall always place himself
next to the curb was then absolutely
necessary to protect the silks and furbe-
lows of the gentler sex from the filth
splashed across the sidewalk by horses
and vehicles

   the revival of interest in roads at the
beginning of the nineteenth century
seems to have been pretty general
throughout the civilized world - except
in the united states john macadam
the scottish engineer whose name has
become the symbol of good highways
was studying the question from a physi-
cal and economical standpoint and a
few years later was to announce the
theory and demonstrate the method
which have since remained the standard
of good practise

  macadam maker of modern roads

  as with most worthy inventions-for
the macadamized road must really rank
as a great invention-there was at first
a storm of violent opposition many
communities in the north of england
and in scotland-and in other places
too where they ought to have known
better - utterly refused to countenance
any improvements they didnt wish
good roads they wouldnt have good
roads

  and the reasons given in support of
the opposition were quite as ridiculous
as the opposition itself but the facts
conquered as they inevitably will all
that macadam needed to demonstrate his
ideas was a poor road-the poorer the

better for his purpose given some
stones and some old men or women or
boys he did the rest with his little ham-
mer

   for it was not the least of his discov-
eries that more stones of the proper size
could be broken if the operator was seat-
ed and used a hammer weighing not
more than two pounds than with a ten-
pound sledge this made it possible to
employ a class of labor which was prac-
tically useless for any other purpose-
in other words the poor of the parishes
who had been thrown upon public char-
ity through their inability to earn a liv-
ing

  profit beyond money measurement

  with the economies introduced by
macadam he was able to reach the most
astonishing results it is recorded that
he rebuilt a road eleven miles long near
bristol-which was so utterly bad that its
abandonment had been practically de-
cided upon-at an expenditure of only
two hundred and seventy-five dollars a
mile under favorable conditions good
roads - perfect roads - were derived
from nearly impassable highways at a
cost of four or five hundred dollars a
mile in the maintenance charges too
he effected a revolution reducing the
annual cost of repairs from as much as
two thousand dollars a mile to three
hundred and fifty dollars and even less

   these figures are striking enough but
the most important results of macadams
work are not susceptible of being ex-
pressed in terms of currency paths
which could only be used by horses load-
ed with panniers-or at best for un-
wieldy carts carrying a few hundred
pounds-were fot the small sums just
mentioned converted into roads over
which a single horse could without
straining draw a cart-load of more than
a ton exclusive of the weight of the
vehicle

  although macadam had been at work
for many years it was not until about
 that he publicly explained his ideas
which were generally accepted by engi-
neers  and except for one detail they pre-
vail to-day

  first and foremost he insisted upon
the use of nothing but small stones his


the railroad mans magazine

standard weight being six ounces next
he forbade the use of binding materials
such as clay or earth of a sticky quality
for the rest he depended upon hammer-
ing and rolling the stones together until
they became so interlocked that they
formed a solid mass

  his plan of construction varied only
in making roads thicker or thinner ac-
cording as the traffic they had to bear
was heavy or light in this particular
he allowed himself the greatest leeway
running from three inches to eighteen
inches in depth of  metal

  only at one point as has been said
have road - builders made a departure
from macadams methods and whether
the departure is an improvement is by
no means certain it consists in laying
a first course of large stones-an idea
which originated with thomas telford
a contemporary of macadam and a
british engineer of great accomplish-
ments

slow beginning in the land of the free

  telford made his first course of stones
with pieces from six to eight inches deep
and not more than four inches wide
laid close together on their widest edges
and filled in with smaller wedge-shaped
stones while macadam curved the top
of the ground before laying any stone
telford leveled the surface and then
formed the curve by placing the deepest
rocks in the middle and gradually re-
duced the depth of the foundation to-
ward the ditches by using smaller stones

  in all other essentials the two methods
agree and a perfect road may be built
in either way  but there is a certain su-
periority in the macadam plan because
of its greater convenience and the pos-
sibility of building thinner roads for
light traffic sometimes too it is diffi-
cult to secure large stones of the right
size for the telford foundation without
greatly increasing the cost whereas with
the macadam plan any available stones
may be broken to the required dimen-
sions

  for fifty years the highways of west-
ern europe have been in general as per-
fect as human ingenuity and experience
could make them  but we in the united
states are still in our infancy as road-

makers instead of being well ad-
vanced toward the european staudard
we are struggling with the elementary
problems of the subject

  shall the federal government take
active steps or not  is it a proper func-
tion for the individual states ought a
county to interfere with the roads in the
various townships that compose it and
if a few farmers in a township prefer
bad roads to good ones are their neigh-
bors powerless to effect any improve-
ment 

  these are a few of the questions
which oppose the wheels of progress in
the-united states in certain parts of
the east we have fairly good roads hi
the neighborhood of the larger cities
in a few of the eastern states there are
good working road laws but in the
 imperial  state of new york the old
useless plan of working out the road tax
still exists in many communities and has
only been abolished in certain sections
after a prolonged heart - breaking
struggle

  most states hold to the practise of
electing  pathmasters -they are called
by different names in different states
but this title best expresses their duties-
who assess the amount of the road tax
and call upon the inhabitants to work
it out or to pay a certain amount of
money toward that end a description
of the working out of a road tax is of
interest because it is the method which
obtains over nearly the whole of the
united states though it could not pos-
sibly be more certain of resulting badly
if it had been intelligently designed for
that end

  how they do it in tlie country

  the pathmaster is supposed to keep a
careful eye upon the highways under his
jurisdiction to see that the roadways
are traversable and that the bridges shall
not break down he is granted by the
county or township authorities a nomi-
nal sum of money for repairs and im-
provements which sum is assessed pro-
portionally upon the taxpayers hi his
district and for the collection of which
the pathmaster is responsible in a certain
measure he is only partially responsi-
ble however because the statutes allow
pathways of

the citizens to comply with the tax in
any one of three ways

  first they may themselves work on
the roads for the number of days equiva-
lent to their taxes at the usual rate of
one dollar a day

   second they may hire substitutes to
work for them

   third they may pay cash to the path-
master and have done with it

   as a result of this nearly every one
either elects to work out the tax or hires
some one to do it for him if the second
some very amusing bargains may he made
a the taxpayer says to b the hireling
 if youll work out my tax ill let you
cut a certain number of cords off my
wood lot  or b says to a  ill work
your tax if youll let me have a certain
quantity of skim milk for my hogs

  if a has nothing that any b will
trade for then a must pay cash for his
labor which it may be taken for granted
is always below the market rate and b
will very probably be one of the town
drunkards

   there is always a small minority how-
ever who pay their lax directly to the
pathmaster and this is the chief jewel in
his crown he is almost always a penny
politician with a longing for office and
here is his chance to make friends this
tax must lie spent upon the roads and
although five or six hours desultory
scratching by tom dick and harry
does not amount to any sort of a days
work nevertheless a vote is a vote they
are constituents and they know their
value at the polls they also know that
the pathmaster has his eye on the place
of poor warden and there is an easy
living to be made off the poorhouse

its good points

  the pathmaster-who seldom knows
anything about road building - cannot
live by his pathmastership alone he has
some other business of course the dull
seasons of the year are selected for work-
ing on the roads when at the same time
it is agreeable to be out of doors a
certain day is appointed for working out
the tax

   it even has points of superiority be-
cause the women folks arent around to
bother and interfere the  work  is

the wheel	

conducted in a delightfully companion-
able manner no bossing come late
and leave early all the good old stories
polished up and put into new clothes
and perhaps a bottle slyly tucked away
in the  bag  of your shirt particularly
if the town is  temperance

  such a system is nothing less than a
blot upon our american civilization its
results are manifest and are known of
all men who have ever been forced to
drive or ride over an ordinary country
road in almost any of the united states
in any but the most favorable weather

and he missed his train

  the writer has a vivid recollection of
missing a connection in the northern cen-
tral part of the state of new york in
the heart of a splendid farming country
during the early part of the month of
may it was possible to correct the
trouble by driving twenty miles across
country to another railway and there
were five hours in which to do it so a
good pair of horses was hired with a
driver whose ambition was fired by the
promise of a substantial honorarium if
he caught the train

  but he did not get it there was not
a foot of the way over which it was
proper to trot a horse and for at least
three-fourths of the drive it was physi-
cally impossible to goad the animals be-
yond a walk when the end of the jour-
ney was reached something more than
six hours after the start they were just
able to stagger into the stable where they
were to spend the night

  there was no excuse for this condi-
tion of affairs there were probably
enough stones immediately on and under-
neath the surface of the road to have
made a driveway fit for a park if only
some one could have been found to pick
them up break them and hammer them
together

  it is certainly not fair to lay all the
sins of bad roads upon the paymasters
head he is not so much to blame as
the system under which he works which
is maintained through the ignorance or
the indifference of the people who make
the laws it is unfair to criticize subor-
dinate officials when a commission ap-
pointed by the governor of one of the


the railroad mans magazine

leading states in the union is able to
report in almost so many words that it
would be better to build electric rail-
roads on the highways than for the state
to take any steps toward making them
traversable for horse vehicles it may
sound incredible but that such a report
was made to the governor of ohio will-
iam mckinley in the year  is as
certain as that it was printed for general
distribution

  but there is a rift in the clouds ken-
tucky has benefited by an excellent sys-
tem of roads for more than a generation
to be sure they were delivered into the
hands of a conscienceless  ring  for
many years and it required a mortal
struggle to get them back  yet the people
had the use of them for the whole period

  new jersey so often the subject of
contemptuous flings and so seldom de-

with an automobile reach his office from

chapter ix

 the man in the carriage

alking slowly
along the street i
felt that i had clone
a good days work
in mrs noyes ma-
ria had found a
much-needed friend and in her house
she would be sae-safe for a time that
is-for i did not imagine that a com-
monplace device like the changing of
a cab or two would throw her pursuers
permanently from the scent ne easy
way to recover it was to watch me as
the thought occurred to me i involun-
tarily glanced behind no one was in
sight and i walked  half ashamed of
my sigh of relief but it is not com-
fortable to feel that one is watched and
spied on

began in the august railroad mao

  however i could spy as well as be
spied upon several clues were in my
hand but the one i elected to follow-
first was the hotel auvergne at the
entrance to the restaurant however i
turned back my friend the musician
would not be there until the evening
to ask for him would simply serve to
draw down suspicion

  i had no idea how many of the em-
ployees had been concerned in the last
nights outrage and by asking questions
of them i might be merely playing into
their hands i would dine there that
night and find some way to interview
the violinist

  my intention was not fulfilled half
a block from the hotel i was halted by
a familiar voice and david marshfield
confronted me

   i have just come from your place
he began  i want you to dine at our
house to-night

   magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

   cant do it said i thinking of my
prospective detective work  i have
something else on

 oh i know its short notice but its
all for your good im always thinking
for you and i never even get thanked
 what have you thought now   i
laughed

    thought you might like to go to
abyssinia

  abyssinia are you crazy dave
who ever goes to abyssinia

  nobody that i ever knew re-
turned marshfield  thats the reason
i thought you might like to every-
body goes to europe nowadays theres
no glory in that

   im not looking for glory i an-
swered  im looking for pleasure
is there any pleasure in abyssinia

   how do i know  asked david
 i never went there but it sounds like
a perfectly good place to me youd
better go

  i took marshfield by the arm and led
him in the direction of my rooms
have you been drinking i demand-
ed  or do you simply want to get rid
of me

  neither i dont drink - certainly
not in the morning-and i am so far
from wishing to be rid of you that if you
go ill go too

  and why abyssinia i demanded
again

  and why not abyssinia but as a
matter of fact there is a very good rea-
son for abyssipia-namely my father
you know he has so much money that
lies never happy unless hes making
more just now he thinks that he can
make it there

   great scott lies not going

  i stopped short  the pavement over-
whelmed by the vision of the senior
marshfield the great banker who for
years had never been beyond reach of
the blackest and most expensive cigars
the market afforded dragging his portly
figure up and down the wild mountains
of abyssinia if he was going i for
one was not i knew that great man s
temper when his food did not please him

  marshfield walked on with a snort of
disgust

   of course lies not do you think
hes lost bis mind hes heard of a

gold-mine there and he thinks it may
be a good thing-railroads american
hustle awakening of the slumbering
orient light  the dark continent-
all that sort of thing-and he wants me
to investigate therefore i ask you to
dinner

   because i wont get any dinners in
abyssinia i suppose

   you wont if you dont go said
david imperturbably  i ask you be-
cause you will meet the man who lias the
claim to the mine and the concession for
the railroad a big gun from italy just
come over here with all sorts of schemes
in his head and a great thirst for amer-
ican capital and american brains to
carry them out the marshfield family
he considers can supply both

   anyhow if the business falls
through-and theres a hitch somewhere
from last accounts-it wont do you any
harm to meet this fellow hes a big
man they say-commissioner of emigra-
tion or something - and if you go to
italy he may make it pleasant for you-
a friend of the marshfields you know
and that kind of rot

  the last words came with difficulty
from davids lips he was the son of
a wealthy and powerful man he knew
it and for that reason rarely alluded to
it to have david marshfield consent
to use his undoubted personal influence
in ones behalf was a great compliment

  in this case his influence meant much
the idea of a trip into unknown abys-
sinia in his company fascinated me
even if that wild scheme came to noth-
ing italy would be much pleasanter if
one had friends at court for an in-
stant i listened to the voice of the
tempter then the vision of the girl i
had left in the house of my cousin rose
before me

   i cant come dave i said  im
an amateur detective now

   youre a what  marshfield stopped
at the entrance of my apartment and
stared at me youre a what he
repeated as i laughed at his obvious
consternation

   come up-stairs and ill tell you
about it  led the way into my sitting-
room and sketched for his benefit all
that had happened since he last sat there
with me
the spider of palermo	

   whe - e - ew  marshfields long
whistle marked the end of my story
 so thats what you do when you quit
a job is it he walked over to the
window to look once more at the house
which was the birthplace of my adven-
tures

    ill tell you what it is he turned
suddenly upon me  you come to din-
ner and well go down to the auvergne
afterward ive got to be home to din-
ner and it wont do any harm for you
to have somebody with you if you must
move in low society

  done we shook hands upon the
bargain and marshfield departed it
was with a distinct feeling of unexpected
support that i watched his broad figure
swing across the square

  a cynical humorous calm was his
chosen attitude  but no thought of fear
ever disturbed it and the possibility of
seeking comfort or safety at the expense
of a friend had never entered his head
his company at the auvergne would be
purchased cheaply at the cost of two or
three hours of heavy feeding and heavier
conversation

   personally i had little interest in the
kind of talk i knew i would hear that
night at the marshfield tabic my own
small supply of capital was safely in-
vested in stocks that neither rose nor fell
appreciably and when men spoke of
millions as i did of hundreds i was
dazed rather than impressed neverthe-
less as i walked up to the quiet brown-
stone house which sheltered the famous
banker i was curious it must be a
singular man i thought who could in-
terest that hard-headed financier in any-
thing so imaginative as a gold-mine in
abyssinia

  a carriage drew up in front of the
marshfield door and the figure ol a man
crossed the pavement the light from the
carriage-lamps falling for a second on
the silk of his tall hat the door the
footman opened for him swung shut
again as he passed within  and at the
same instant my stick dropped from my
hand as i wheeled about and stared into
the night at the retreating shadow of the
carriage

  as it had driven past me my eve had
fallen upon another man who still re-
mained within it lie too was in eve-

    	r r

ning-clothes and as he leaned forward
to light a cigarette the flame from the
match in his fingers revealed his face
it was the scoundrel with whom i had
rolled down-stairs the man i had left
in the gloomy courtyard of barent
street and now  saw him driving
away from the house where - was to
dine

  while i stared the carriage whirled
around a corner and was gone then
suddenly i awoke to action lie had
come with a companion and his com-
panion had stayed  would learn who
he was

  past the astonished lackey at the door
 burst running with unseemly haste up
the stairs to the drawing-room above to
meet the marshfield guests twelve men
were there twelve men in black coats
and white waistcoats-twelve respect-
able prosperous well-fed individuals
six of them were strangers and one of
the six had come there with my enemy

chapter x

mr marshfields dinner guests

dreatliing heavily i stood by
the portieres my eye traveling
over the luxurious room and the decor-
ous group gathered within it two of
marshfields junior partners were there
comparatively young men whom he had
selected for the heavy w-ork of adding
to his great fortune standing by the
fireplace was a civil engineer whose
opinion was taken as gospel in his pro-
fession  a railroad president who had
once granted me an interview was talk-
ing to two strangers it was all as i
had anticipated half an hour ago that it
would be-a business dinner into which
i intruded by grace of davids friend-
ship

  to me however it was no longer an
ordinary dinner with these men i was
about to sit down to meat and one of
them was on friendly terms with the vil-
lain i had fought once and hoped to
fight again no friend of that mans
could be a friend of mine and i eyed
the assembled guests with panting ob-
vious suspicion

   for heavens sake steve whats
up immaculate in evening - dress


ti-ie railroad mans magazine

david marshfield crossed the room
 you look as if you were in a hurry

   i was afraid i was late i mum-
bled conscious that his greeting had
drawn all eyes to me

  with the vague idea of lending
strength to my words i pulled out my
watch consulted it with quite unneces-
sary interest and replaced it in my
pocket it is late i asserted posi-
tively

  david glanced at me with a quick
puzzled frown  what- he began
then stopped and took me by the arm
 youre not tlie last lie said formally
 let me introduce you to the men you
dont know mr hayes do you re-
member my friend mr paget

  the famous engineer looked me over
critically as he held out his hand
 cant say i do but  am glad to meet
mr paget again

  i shook hands with him internally
blessing daves tact he knew that it
was not because it wastwo minutes
after the appointed dinner-hour that i
had burst into the drawing-room like one
socially demented that any one would
have known but not every one would
have closed his lips upon his knowledge
instead of pestering me with questions
he was trotting me about the room re-
peating introductions until as  shook
hands with one celebrity after another
my excited entrance was forgotten

mr paget-mr gbedina mr mar-
shall-mr paget and mr rocca-mr
paget you know my father of course
old marshfield laughed as he grasped
my hand

   youll introduce him to yourself
next dave yes i know stephen pa-
get but i never knew him to look quite
so flustered before whats the matter
with you steve afraid youll miss the
train to abyssinia dont worry about
that my boy its not going to start
before dinner eh mr rocca

  he turned with another laugh to the
square-set black-mustached man by his
side apparently he considered that he
had said something witty but the point
of the joke-whatever it may have been
-was lost upon rocca his guests lips
it is true smiled politely but his face
was quite impassive otherwise as he an-
swered 

   let us hope not i like my dinner
does mr - er-paget  think--does
mr paget expect to go to abyssinia

   well if i go steve goes and the
rest of it you and the governor will have
to settle between yourselves

   looked with more interest at mr
rocca david had spoken carelessly-
he was never renowned as a respecter of
persons-but it was clear from his
words that this was the big italian in-
dividual who could make it pleasant for
me abroad if he did not send me treas-
ure-hunting into the african wilderness

  there was nothing romantic in his ap-
pearance - no traces of gold - mines -
nothing which had i been the slumber-
ing rient would have disturbed my
age-long rest he was the italian coun-
terpart of the american marshfield with
the same square determined jaw the
same bulging intelligent forehead the
lips were heavier and coarser however 
and the figure unusually powerful for
a latin showed visibly the years of good
living it had enjoyed

   that is interesting you and mr
paget are great friends then

  the words were  addressed to david
but his eyes were on me as he spoke-
dark italian eyes deep-set under heavy
brows and shaded by long lashes

   we have been friends for a number
of years i remarked a little weary of
holding the center of the stage

   and you would like to go to abys-
sinia 

    hadnt thought of it until this
morning i answered  but if all the
world is going  might as well join the
procession

   all the world is not going rocca
jerked the words out with vicious em-
phasis  very far from it mr paget
but of course -he turned with euro-
pean grace to david - a friend of
yours mr marshfield would be most
welcome and mr paget looks like a
hardy and courageous young man is it
not so 

  to my vast annoyance i felt myself
blushing-less at the compliment than
at the keen scrutiny of the impassive
eyes david saw njy color rise and
laughed

   oh hell do mr rocca one does
not have to be very courageous around
the spider of palermo	

new york though the police attend
to that for us

   yes and we are a long way from
abyssinia yet the senior marshfield put
in abruptly  i can furnish all the
hardy and courageous young men we
need mr rocca what i want to see
is the money in it

    it is there returned rocca unruf-
fled  in due time you will see it

    theres no time like the present
retorted marshfield with a touch of sar-
casm  heres simpson at last and we
might as well go into dinner

  at the door of the dining - room i
stepped aside respectfully to allow the
elder men to precede me one by one
i watched them file past for the most
part grave with the weight of years and
wealth all distinguished in some way
none to be connected in the wildest
flights of the imagination with disrepu-
table cabmen and shabby attic-rooms

   last of all sauntered david his hands
in his pockets his face eloquent of bore-
dom i kicked his foot as he came op-
posite me

    one of thems here  whispered as
he sprang into alert attention

  one of whom davids hands
were out of his pockets now and his
face was keen and sharp

    one of the gang  recognized that
little brute driving away i tell you
one-

    david steve  come in here con-
found you and sit down this is no
time for secret conferences

   the elder marshfields good - natured
commanding tones drowned my whisper
and we walked obediently into the
dining-room he was quite right it
was no time for consultation-it was a
time for open eyes and keen wits

  my eyes were open and i lashed my
wits to the utmost limit of their keen-
ness yet  saw nothing two or three
places below david and separated from
him moreover by the width of the
table there was no possibility of con-
tinuing my interrupted confidence  nce
i caught his gaze fastened on me in
amazed speculation but i motioned
slightly with my head and he looked
away after that i never met his eye

   it was the longest dinner it was ever
my misfortune to attend my neigh-

bors were marshfields junior partners
in their chiefs presence they had no
leisure for anything so insignificant as
the conversation of an ex-newspaper
man from the oysters to the cheese
their ears were straining to hear what
marshfield said to rocca and what
rocca said to marshfield and stupid
enough it was  thought

  rocca discoursed on the wonders of
new yorks sky-line his host joked
ponderously out of the tail of my eye
i saw david smother a yawn  and the
miscellaneous guests conversed on mis-
cellaneous topics

   was clinging desperately to the last
shred of my patience when the tray of
cigars reached me at the same time
david pushed back his chair and walked
around the table to me one of my din-
ner companions leaping at the chance
to thrust himself closer to the magnates
deserted us in haste for the place lie had
left vacant and david fell into the
empty chair by my side

   give me a light steve he remarked
then bending forward to touch his
cigar to the match  held out to him
 what the deuce did you mean

  	glanced along the length of the
table chairs were rasping on the floor
as the guest settled back to the full en-
joyment of tobacco coffee and liqueurs
no one was paying any attention to the
two ycjung men at the foot of the table

   i mean i said  that one of these
men came here with the fellow i rolled
down the stairs you can explain that
perhaps-i cant

  david lolled back in his chair and
looked at the ceiling  who is it he
asked aloud in a tone of utter indiffer-
ence from his attitude one would have
thought we were discussing a new com-
missioner of street cleaning usually
apparent frankness is the best disguise
and i answered with equal boldness

   i dont know thats the funny
part i want you to learn for me

  the words rang through the room as
though they had roared through a meg-
aphone one of the sudden discon-
certing silences which are apt to seize
large gatherings had fallen on the com-
pany every one heard me no one had
more important things to occupy him
and all turned toward us


the railroad mans magazine

   whats that cried marshfield
from the head of the table  what do
you want to learn paget no use ask-
ing dave if its anything to do with
business  i can tell you that

  forced to say something  seized on
he first word in my mind

   it isnt business-its abyssinia i
want to know what we are all going
there for

   ha ha ha  old -marshfields big
frame shook with laughter  wiser
heads than yours want to know that my
boy-eh rocca

  he turned to his guest as he had done
before dinner and once more that dis-
tinguished gentleman failed to appre-
ciate his humor

   some wiser heads know already he
retorted stiffly not that mr paget is
not wise he added quickly with a for-
eign bow to me

   h confound your jokes marsh-
field   it was llayes the engineer
who spoke  you said you had the
biggest thing i had ever done waiting
for me where is it thats what 
want to know  and  want you not your
son to tell me

  few men spoke to mr marshfield
that way but hayes was a privileged
genius the bankers smile was broader
than ever as he answered

   thats what we all want to know
hayes and mr roccas going to tell
us

  rocca took the cigar from his mouth
and his teeth hashed in a self-possessed
smile ah in good time mr marsh-
field in italy we do not do business in
such a-what you call it-hustle

   there hasnt been much hustle about
this snorted marshfield  you were
going to tell us all about it to-night
you remember and thats a month later
than you first wrote now we are wait-
ing

   i have changed my mind rocca
put the cigar back in his mouth and
puffed at it complacently quite oblivious
to the frown marshfields clerks had
learned to tremble at

   and we can change ours cried the
banker

  then vou will lose not  returned
the italian calmly  there is more
money in the world mr marshfield

than opportunities like this to invest it
but you americans must always talk

business

   why spoil a delightful evening in
a day or two i bring you a definite
proposition until then- he spread
out his hands in an eloquent gesture and
relapsed into silent contemplation of his
cigar

   until then hayes put in sharply
 you might tell us what started you on
abyssinia its the last place on earth
 always thought

 ah you americans rocca
shrugged iris shoulders  you think the
world begins with new york and ends
with san francisco you forget that we
italians have been in abyssinia for many
vears it it not the last place to us

   its the last place you got jolly well
thrashed in muttered a man near us

  but he was neither a genius nor suf-
ficiently wealthy to speak his thoughts
too loud and no one else cared to throw
in the face of the great rocca the com-
plete defeat of the italian army of occu-
pation

   whatis it like persisted hayes
 how longs this road of yours whats
the country shes going through if its
bad country you cant build a road for
nothing you know i can do it as cheap
as anybody but it will have to be a good
mine if thats whats to pay for it

   i f it were what you call a good coun-
try returned rocca  there would be
no need to come to america for an en-
gineer mr hayes

  hayess weather-beaten face relaxed
in a broad grin

   very nice mr rocca  but kind
words build no railroads

  	oh drop it llayes marshfield
broke in peremptorily  this isnt the
first class in geography survey parties
can teach us all that mr rocca is to
give us something more

   ah but it is very interesting
rather to my surprise rocca dropped
the cold reticence with which he had
hitherto met every reference to abys-
sinia for more than half an hour he
regaled the company with an impromptu
lecture on the country the people their
customs religion and history

after the first few moments my
thoughts wandered from the man dro-
the spider of palermo

s

ning on at the head of the table to the
girl i had found shelterless in washing-
ton square the wild ravines and
dreary uplands of mountain africa
faded from my mind and  saw instead
an old-fashioned stiff drawing-room
mrs noyes standing there one arm
around a slender black-garbed figure a
sensitive face pale beneath a mass of
dark hair long lashes which lifted for
a second to let one flash of gratitude
and trust reach me

  probably at that moment maria and
cousin lucy were sitting in that room
and i was here wasting my time on an
unillustrated lecture on foreign travel
davids voice in my ear shattered the
vision

   he talks like an encyclopedia just
as long and about as exciting thank
the lord its over at last

  old marshfield had risen and his
guests were trooping out of the dining-
room in half an hour at the most we
would be free to pursue our investiga-
tions at the auvergne but what then
in this house there was a clue ready to
my hand and i had not been able to
grasp it what better chance would i
have in the tumult of a restaurant

   what a beastly bore  david came
up to me as  stood in a secluded cor-
ner watching the assemblage  i won-
der what the governors thinking about
to bring all these people here to listen
to such truck the man didnt say a
thing that you couldnt have read in half
the time

   i wasnt listening i answered
 how soon will you be able to get
away  

   oli in a minute or two i fancy
hallo what does rocca want with us

  the great man w-as crossing the room
toward us with the evident intention of
entering into conversation mindful of
his place as assistant host david ad-
vanced a step to meet him

   very interesting mr rocca he
said with a solemn face  you have
convinced me that i must go to abys-
sinia

  the italians keen eyes shot a quick
penetrating glance at the young man
he was hardly the type of person i
would have undertaken to beguile with
social sugar-plums

   you are polite at least he- re-
marked suavely  but what  said was
nothing i f you and your friend are
really interested  should be delighted
to talk more to you and to show you
various things  have in my rooms why
should you not come with me now
after dinner in a crowd is no place for
serious conversation

  an acceptance trembled on my lips
but david took the words out of my
mouth it is unfortunate but mr
paget and i have an engagement to-
night perhaps you will give us another
opportunity

   ah you young men so full of pleas-
ure that you have no time for business
well time cures that to-morrow at
lunch perhaps my agents have taken
an apartment for me in thirtieth street
-shall we say at one oclock

   with pleasure i hastened to say
before marshfield could decline the sec-
ond invitation

  with a smile that laid bare his white
teeth rocca bade us a courteous good
night shook hands with the rest of the
party and took himself off as his fig-
ure vanished through the door  turned
to marshfield

   why the dickens didnt you go
you neednt have been in such a rush
to decline

  why echoed david why in-
deed didnt you say you wanted to
play old sleuth at the auvergne

   and why not play it in roccas
rooms i retorted

  my friend regarded me with silent
obvious contempt

  why not  repeated warmly
stephen you are in danger of be-
coming a conceited ass the whole
world does not revolve around your
flights down-stairs or your fligfits of
fancy either rocca is a big man with
his head full of big schemes youre not
a scheme and youre not big

   a fine pair of sleuths wed be sit-
ting up in his rooms and yawning over
another volume of that abyssinia rot
youve got me in for it to-morrow as
it is for the lords sake give me a
rest now

  david concluded his long speech by
leaving me in order to announce to his
father his intention of going out ten

minutes later we were walking rapidly
down fifth avenue and i was wonder-
ing whether after all i had not dreamed
my vision of the man lighting his ciga-
rette in the carriage

       a friend in need

tphe dinner crowd had gone and the
restaurant of the auvergne was
beginning to fill again with its usual
nightly throng of supper patrons when
we reached it no popular restaurant is
long deserted in new york breakfast
and luncheon dinner and supper they
tread so closely on each others heels that
to the stranger it must seem as if the
citys life was one vast meal

  but i was in no humor for specula-
tion on new yorks appetite instead
i studied the head waiter as he ushered
us to a corner table-studied him and
learned nothing if he possessed any
knowledge of last nights trap his
stolid smooth-shaven face did not re-
veal it

   bovsoir m iaget he murmured
recommended sweetbreads with mush-
rooms sous cloche took our order for
the food we did not want and departed
 decided he knew nothing

  the orchestra started the old  santa
lucia and once more t heard the hun-
garians voice filling the room i
pointed him out to marshfield a pic-
turesque figure in his blue sailor blouse
and gaudy venetian sash david turned
in his chair to look at the friend who
was as mysterious as my enemies

  instinctively the man must have felt
the intent gaze upon him for his eyes
fell at once upon our table the high
notes of santa lucia faltered a lit-
tle and i knew that he had recognized
me in a second he was singing as be-
fore but there was inquiry in the eyes
still turned upon our table

  i raised my glass reassuringly toward
him at the same time pulling out my
watch it was a cryptic message that
i wished to see him later but he un-
derstood with an almost imperceptible
nod of his head he looked away and
the strains of  santa lucia  rang out
more joyously than ever

   fine-looking fellow was davids
comment as lie settled back in his chair
after his inspection  how are we go-
ing to get a chance to talk to him

   hell find a way keep your ears
open maybe he will sing us a mes-
sage

   yes and my eyes too returned
marshfield  heres another friend to
make the evening pleasant dont
look  he added sharply as i was about
to turn my head in the direction of his
gaze  he hasnt seen us and theres
no use in telling him we are here

  who is it i demanded

   ghedina you remember him-the
chap who sat opposite me at dinner a
young fellow not more than thirty-five
at the most

   i o you suppose he could be the
man were after  asked rather doubt-
fully  he didnt have a word to say
for himself and i didnt think twice
about him but what the dickens could
bring him here if he has nothing to do
with it

  what brings all these people here
marshfield waved his slim hand about
the room now comfortably crowded
 lights food drink music the search
for some kind of excitement look
here steve he leaned across the table
and his voice was graver than he often
allowed it to become

     told you once before you were in
danger of making an ass of yourself over
this business and i mean it if you are
going to play detective youve got to
keep your head

   suppose you really did see that fel
low driving away from our house it
doesnt prove that the man he took there
knew what he had been up to with you
 know lots of tough characters- but
so far ive kept clear of the police its
ten to one that ghedina never saw your
friend and that he came here to wash
the taste of the abyssinian lecture out
of his mouth im going to watch him
of course  but theres no use in getting
excited about it

  i eyed david in displeasure for a mo-
ment it is not agreeable to be accused
of a case of the rattles at critical mo-
ments

  it seems to me i remarked that
rocca is not the only lecturer to-night
the spider of palermo	

anil if you knew miss bigontina and
had rolled up and down stairs and in
and out of cabs for the past day or two
you might wake up a bit yourself
david broke out in a hearty laugh
 ill take it all back you are a model
of calm courage to prove my repent-
ance i will make a suggestion you
can see the fiddler there and i can see
the back of ghedinas head you watch
your man and ill watch mine and the
devil take the hindmost

   i laughed and for a few minutes we
sat playing with the food the waiter
brought and watching

  anything doing asked david at
last  bookkeeping is more exciting
than this kind of detective business

   wait i cautioned  here comes
my man theres just the chance that
he will sing to us

   as i spoke the orchestra broke into
the weird hungarian melody  maria
that i had heard the night before the
violinists voice filled the room with a
subtle melancholy and we sat fasci-
nated oblivious of his charge david
turned to face the man the fork with
which he had been pretending to eat
waving slowly in the air as he kept time
involuntarily to the slow chant

  then he came-croning over his vio-
lin as before--the whole soul of an
ancient race pouring itself out in a lan-
guage but half intelligible to the pleas-
ure-seeking throng he sang to he
passed us without a word or sign sing-
ing his way through the crowded room

   there was no joy in the song only a
numb despair through which ran a cur-
rent of sheer defiance like the cheer of
dying men i had never heard him like
that before lie knew that the throng
was there for merriment not for sad-
ness and that he must please the throng
but to-night-to-night i fancy he was
pleasing himself

   down the room he marched halted by
the window where he had stood to warn
maria and myself wheeled about and
still singing started toward us from
his throat he poured a torrent of wrath
and revolt that mounted higher and
higher-mounted faltered and died
snuffed out in one hideous abrupt gasp

   at that sudden shattering of a tre-
mendous vision every soul in the room

started but only david and  held the
key to the secret of the collapse the
violinist was opposite ghedinas table
the violin had dropped from his shoul-
der and hung mute in his hand while
he stared as into a serpents eye at the
face of our late dinner companion we
saw ghedinas look fastened  the un-
happy wretch in front of him saw his
heavy jaw protrude viciously saw his
lips move under his carefully curled
slight mustache as he spoke to the man
then while we gazed at the dimly un-
derstood tragedy the hungarian tore
himself from the fascination of that bale-
ful face and rushed up the room toward
the orchestras platform

  it was a different man that passed us
the fire had died in the eyes  under the
high cheek-bones the face was ashen
gray and the bow of the violin shook
in the silenced singers hand behind
him as i sat awed and dum founded in
my chair  caught a glimpse of ghe-
dinas cynical smile it was from that
that my friend was fleeing

  purple with rage the gross figure of
the head waiter pursued the musician
the orchestra had stopped in consterna-
tion at their leaders downfall a chorus
of exclamations and jeers rose from the
guests of the restaurant and through it
all i felt rather than saw the secret core
of the sudden tumult the smile of the
man with whom i had been dining an
hour ago

  my lord muttered david

   its ghedina  i cried under my
breath  ghedina is our man  

  and if lie is breathed marshfield
 and if he is-what then  

  what then indeed already the res-
taurants patrons weary of the seconds
sensation were settling down to their
neglected suppers even as he spoke
ghedinas eye fell upon the excited form
of my friend half-risen from his chair
he nodded pleasantly as though he
found the evening most delightful
turned to his table and raised a glass
of wine toward his hosts son in which
to drink his health

  it was a charming exhibition of old-
world courtesy and marshfield forced
himself to respond lifting his own
glass he touched his lips to the rim
then set it down abruptly


the railroad mans magazine

  it chokes me he growled hoarsely
the cursed brute what does it
mean  

  across the serving-table by our side
a grimy hand shot out to thrust a piece
of paper in front of me i glanced up
in time to see an  omnibus an igno-
rant waiters helper turn hastily away
in front of me was a hurried illiterate
scrawl which i could with difficulty de-
cipher 

come to the cafe i need help

  one swift glance told me that ghe-
dinas attention was no longer bestowed
upon us i tossed the paper over to
david and rose from the table marsh-
fields eyebrows lifted slightly but he
made no other sign and i strode down
the room at ghedinas table i paused
for a moment took a cigarette from my
pocket tapped it on the box once or
twice and lighted it

   good evening mr ghedina didnt
they give you enough to eat at tlie
marslifields  

  oh mr paget good evening wo
meet again i see the fellow rose
from the table with a cordiality that was
almost effusive  but i do not come to
eat-i come to see new york but you
-you are native here is it not so are
you hungry so soon again  

  i forced a laugh from dry lips  oh
no it is near where i live and i came
for a glass of wine with my friend do
you find new york interesting mr
ghedina 

   very the mans lips curled in the
same smile with which he had followed
the lleeing musician  it is always new
one secs so much of the-er-unexpect-
ed-yes of the unexpected lie added as
though he had found precisely the word
lie sought

   well that is always interesting as
for me i find it much the same

  we bowed politely at each other and
i passed on secure in the belief that
ghedina would not connect my exit with
his own strange interruption of the
hungarians song and i had learned
something too

   the unexpected ghedina had said
then he could not have anticipated meet-
ing the violinist there but if that was

so why had he come at all-to see new
york

   nonsense i said to myself an-
swering my own question as i made my
way to the cafe  hes  raw boy
attracted by electric lights like some
poor moth to a lamp what does he
care for new york

  that question was still unanswered
when i turned into the cafe the vio-
linist was there ahead of me seated at
one of the small marble-topped tables
he had had sufficient command over
himself to sit down but that was all
in tlie minute or two that he had been
waiting for me he had strewn the table
with bits of broken matches and tooth-
picks as t came upon him he was pick-
ing up and dropping the tiny fragments
like one beside himself i had always
seen him strong self-reliant high-spir-
ited and the mans terror appalled me

  at sight of me he sprang up cast one
hunted look around the room and
breathed into- my ear  i tried to help
you you must help me the whisper
ended in a choking sob

  of course  will help you what
do you want

   money

  money involuntarily i drew a
little away from him in natural suspi-
cion was it all part of an elaborate
trick

  was this fellow despite his music
nothing but one of the great army of
minor rascals who live on petty forms
of mild extortion and blackmail  i had
done nothing for which to be black-
mailed it is true but that is not al-
ways essential suddenly i saw my ad-
ventures in a new and sordid light

 money i must have money
the mans face was close to mine again
and it was gray and old there was no
hick about this they have found me
if i stay here three hours i am a dead
man it is my life i ask for give me
money to go

  luck favored him i had drawn a
hundred dollars from the bank that
afternoon and the bulk of it was still
in my pocketbook he snatched greedily
at the wallet i handed him and thrust
it into his pocket with a gasp of joy

 where are you going i de-
manded
the spider of palermo	

  ii occurred to me that r was paying
a hundred dollars for the privilege of
losing the one clue on which t relied
as old marshfield would have said it
was not good business

  the violinist llung out his hands in a
wild gesture  anywhere chicago
new orleans where the-first train
goes anywhere away from him  

   from ghedina 

  the violinist nodded too much occu-
pied with his own fears to wonder what
 knew of ghedina

 why

   he knows me ah i thought he
was in europe and that here i was safe
he alone knows me it was the devil
who brought him here but there is
time-i may escape yet

  t caught him by the arm as he started
for the door forcing him to listen

  what are you afraid of no one
can hurt you here who is ghedina that
you should run from him

   let me go it is death to stay

  with the strength of the panic-stricken
he tore himself from my grasp then
turned for a second to face me his words
coming in breathless haste though his
voice never rose above a whisper

   they meet to-night-down-stairs in
the annex i know who they are i
recognize them by the walking-sticks i
balked them once-i and my brother
my brother is dead ghedina knows me

he will tell them to-night then they
will hunt me out as they hunted my
brother

   but i have time still and money-
thanks to you sir money  for a sec-
ond the real man showed through his
degrading terror and he bowed with a
certain inborn dignity  good-by sir
and thank you

  i was staring at an empty doorway
the violinist had gone taking with him
the mystery of his own fear and my
warning for a second i gazed awe-
struck at the beginning of the long path
over which the fleeing man had started
then  raised my head

  four or five of the near-by patrons
were looking at me curiously behind the
cigar-stand the fat sleepy cashier had
roused herself to unwonted interest her
round eves protruding in amazement at
the colloquy she had witnessed there
was nothing to be gained by making a
spectacle of myself and  started back to
marshfield

  at his table ghedina was still seated
smoking a cigarette and sipping a glass
of wine he looked up at me with a
pleasant smile as i passed but though
my lips moved there was no answering
smile in my eyes they had pierced be-
yond the suave well-groomed face to the
wall where his coat and hat hung there
was a slight walking-stick there with a
round top of hammered silver

greatest little railroad

correspondent sends us a clip-
ping referring to what he considers
to be the greatest little railroad in the world
and there is no doubt that in proportion to
its length the erie and michigan railway is
one of the best-equipped roads in america
in regard to the length of the road our
correspondents clipping errs slightly on the
side of exaggeration

  the newspaper gives the length of the
road as eleven miles but it is in fact a lit-
tle less than nine and a half contracts have
recently been placed for a new freight mo-
gul and two hundred freight-cars

  when these orders are filled the railroad

will have six locomotives and three hun-
dred freiglu-cars as well as a train of pas-
senger-cars besides all this land equip-
ment the road owns three lake steamers

  the line runs from alabaster on the shore
of tawas bay michigan to east tawas
last year it paid a dividend of twelve per
cent its chief freight items are plaster and
gypsum the latter being found in almost
inexhaustible quantities around alabaster
the company runs four passenger-trains a
day there are seven stations on the line

  the risad is absolutely independent and
the only system it connects with is the de-
troit and mackinaw at east tawas
bees tie up a railroad

by august wolf

every conceivable effort even the wisdom of a bee expert is used
to dislodge them from a tank-pipe-then two
small boys solve the problem

bees are credited with doing all sorts of
unusual things but probably this is
the first time that a queen and her retinue
and subjects completely tied up a railroad

  it happened recently on the harriman sys- 
tern at twin falls idaho when a lusty
swarm accomplished what the james j hill
congress and other well-organized agencies
have repeatedly failed to do

  e r ferguson a traveling salesman of
chicago was an eye-witness he said it
describing the incident

   tin dish-pans tom-toms whistles and
other recognized lures failed to dislodge the
swarm which had settled in the spout of the
standpipe at the water-tank where a long
train of freight-cars stood on the main line
without sufficient water in the boiler of the
big mogul to pull out

   the driver and fireman did excellent
team work in trying to rcaclt the pipe but
the bees gave them short shift and the men
refused to make the second attempt

   h a swab an expert  the honey-
gathering hymcnopterous insects bore down
on the scene to capture the swarm he
was armed with a nail keg and two long
sticks he sent his helper to coax the bees
into the keg but in less than six seconds
the assistant had a score of active bees up
his sleeves and he made a dash toward the
railway station

   the firemen and section crew were next
routed the engineer appealed to agent
sullivan who declared that it was a matter
for the maintenance of way department
the conductor suggested sending for the

sheriff the brakeman on the rear end in-
sisted upon calling out the fire brigade but
the brakeman on the front end offered no
solution as be was nursing a dozen or more
 knobs on his face and hands about the size
of mature hickory nuts

    finally a bystander prescribed the water
cure adding if that doesnt drive em away
nothing will

   a well-directed stream from a garden
hose seemed to have a quieting effect the
pipe was lowered to the intake on the ten-
der and the tank filled with bees and water

    while replacing the pipe the fireman was
attacked by several stragglers and to pro-
tect himself from further onslaught lie tied
a red bandanna handkerchief around his
head after raising ihe spout he tucked the
handkerchief into his pocket and accepted
the congratulations of the onlookers upon
his escape but while mopping his face a
vagrant bee winged its way out of the folds
of the bandanna got busy and stung him on
the lip

  after ihe excitement with jhe bees two
small boys climbed to the roof of the water-
tank and with bare hands captured the
queen they placed her in the bottom of the
keg into which the bees quickly swarmed
mr swab bought the swarm paying for
the youngsters one dollar and twenty-five
cents

   as it is not likely that the real cause of
delaying the train will be incorporated in the
official report to headquarters ihe foregoing
record is made to show how the tie-up oc-
curred

         come boys gather around us back here

november orders

november will see us well out on a
new division we have spent the last
four weeks in adjusting our valves tighten-
ing up and oiling around and the gait we
are going to cut out over the next months
stretch will fairly seorch the ties

  we like to be duly modest ahout our mo-
tive power but its hard a crew that has
spent as much time as we have to get a
smooth motion with a string of line rolling
stock behind is apt to feel that the road is
lucky to have such an outfit running over it

  to get down to facts and they are hard
to get away from we shall pass a new serial
through the injector next month which is
as keen as a headlight on a clear night and
as exciting as a first run over a new track

  another fiction feature to which we point
with pride will be oid burketts disciple
a short story by j r stafford this is
not a railroad story but its a railroad mans
story just as it is any kind of a mans
story it is one of those stories in which a
man is shown in his primitive strength and
his primitive weakness arid it is told in the
way of the man who knows

  then we have emmet f harte in a new
and more serious guise but writing equally
well about the leap of  as he has done
about honk and horace or any other of his
picaresque characters edgar welton cooley
and charles wesley sanders will also be
with us

  doubtless some of our earlier readers will
remember a story we published nearly three
years ago called the reckoning and those
who do remember will be glad to hear that
a story by the same author james norman
shreve entitled the trail of the missed
extra is slated for the november number

  in the matter of special articles we shall
have an interesting historical account of
how railroad men prevented the assassina-
tion of lincoln written by bertram adler
the romantic secret of the automatic
coupler is told by e l bacon and motive
power is dealt with in the help for men
who help themselves department by c f
carter

  railroad nien of fifteen or twenty years
standing will have an old memory revived
for them in the story of  as retold by
remsen crawford while a story on making
up time by t s dayton is as fast as its
title indicates there are others including
the inimitable observations of a country
station-agent and the ninth instalment of
riding the rail from coast to coast
but lest we tell all we know we will save
a few of these little plums for you to dis-
cover when you get the magazine

 the editors safety-valve

tf there is one part on a locomotive that
a can be called more important than an-
other we should say it might be the safety-
valve we are quite mixed up with safety-
valves this month  partly because we wanted
to be and partly because we didnt

  this paragraph is going to be the editors
safety-valve but contrary to that useful bit
of mechanism it is by  means the most
important feature of the magazine still
we are making steam enough to have use
for a safety-valve and we hope you will
patiently listen to its tn

  that little word is one we are mighty
particular about because it is really the
cause of our getting mixed up with safety-
valves again we thought when we had got
off our little piece last month which con-
cluded with the statement that the safety-
valve was popping merrily that we should
be through with safety-valves for a long
time because we were contemplating another
record dash in which we should use all our
steam to the best advantage

  what was our dismay when we found
that the printer had made us inform a wait-
ing world that our safety-valve was
inij honest we never had that kind of a
safety-valve wed as soon think of having
a celluloid crown-sheet or an emergency-
brake emerging from the steam-chest we
wouldnt do it i

  we knew that every eagle eye and every
steam-producer north of patagonia would
open the magazine straight to that page and


the railroad mans magazine

glue his scornful optic on that safety-valve
as it pumped merrily away

  we had two consolations- one was i hat
our readers who are as charitable as they
are critical would not hasten to judge us
until we had a chance to explain and the
other was that as this will be in print be-
fore our shame is made public we can
remedy it before we are overcome with re-
proaches

  we had another use for this safety-valve
bul as this paragraph has taken the shape
of a confession we will let off the remainder
of the steam under another head

j

we issue train orders

the light of the lantern de-
partment is one of the most popular
departments ever run by any magazine and
the more letters we receive the better we
like it there is just one matter however to
which we should like to call the attention
of our readers who use this department and
that is the importance of inquirers signing
all letters with their full name and giving
the postal address

  many of the queries we receive are of a
nature to admit prompt replies through the
mail and to these queries we like to give
individual attention others because of the
specific quality of the answer would lie in
the nature of advertisements and while we
are always glad to give the best advice or
in formation we have by mail such replies
cannot be published in the magazine

  therefore readers will favor us greatly
by using their full names and addresses
when sending questions to this office and
they will in many cases hurry the replies
by doing so of course only the initials
and the city will be used in the magazine
as usual

bound volumes

last month we promised that we should

j have more to say about the bound
volumes of the raiiroab mans magazine
already the reader probably knows all we
were going to say on this subject for doubt-
less by this time he has read the article by
the editor with which this number opens

  in this brief review the leading features
of the past three years work are covered
if when we come to the end of a similar
period the review is as pleasant and as en-
tertaining we feel that both ourselves and
our readers will have every cause for satis-
faction and we are sure that it will be so

tf any of you want to stand in the ob-

scrvation-car with us a little longer and
look back-track with more minuteness than
is possible in a short article we shall be
glad to give you whatever specific informa-
tion you desire about the dates or character
of whatever stories may be of interest to
you or to give you a general idea of what-
ever volume you may have missed if you
will drop us a line taking care to give us
a name and address that uncle sam can
deliver a letter to



shy on lanterns

we want to thank george h wallace
of racine wisconsin for his letter
calling our attention to an illustration in a
recent number in which a railroad man was
pictured with a farmers lantern we apolo-
gize for this awful brecch of railroad eti-
quette and while we may be a little shy
on the shape of lanterns we feel that other-
wise we may be all to the pullman mr
wallace asks in the same letter if we can
resurrect a poem entitled  kelly and burke

brakemen of the old days

 we had this october number on the
 main line all ready to hake the time
 when the following letter from w i skin-
 ner lafayette louisiana hagged us we
 pulled her down to take it aboard and we
 dont regret it	

 editor the railroad mans magazine -
 your article iti the august number in re-
 gard to the brakemen of the good old days
 certainly struck a tender chord in my heart
 it was all so true there are no more
 brakemen they are as you say  train-
 men

 how well i remember back in it when
 i was braking on the louisiana western

railroad between lafayette louisiana and
orange texas one hundred and twelve
miles was the run and it was the days of
goodold hay burners as we used to call
them

  there were no yard crews in those days
to make up our trains and no call-boy to
rout us out we were supposed to line up
at the wood-car and  wood up or till the
tender with heavy pine wood the first thing
in the morning and then get up the train
from any part of the yard wherever the
cars might be found

  there were no air-brakes nor jannev
couplers only the old link and pin and often
we did not have enough pins to make up our
couplings in that case we used to hike out
for the scrap-pile behind the blacksmith
shop and pick up any old bolt that would
hold out long enough to start

  after getting everything ready we would
pull out and on reaching the first station we
would unload all freight for that place and
take on what was going out every twenty-
four miles we came to a wood-pile and we
would wood up the old hay burner again
and that would be the method from lafayette
to orange which point we would reach
about ioo pm having left lafayette at
 am

  we had no cooking outfit in the caboose
and we used to carry our lunch with us and
in very hot weather it usually turned sour
as we had no ice to keep things cool in
fact ice was a luxury we were content to
drink at the waler-tank on reaching orange

  at night we bad to do whatever switching
was required-such as putting in cars at the
freight depot and taking some out assem-
bling lumber-cars placing empty sfock-cars-
and when we finished and put the engine
away in the roundhouse you can believe that
we needed no further inducement to promote
sleep

  in those days orange texas was a good
bit rough there were some jokers in that
burg who thought it fun to take a shot at a
brakemans lamp while he was riding on top
of his train or switching

  the engines were eight-wheel baldwins
and they all bore a name and number only
four trains were operated daily two passen-
ger and two freights a special train was a
rarity and meeting points were compara-
tively easy to make only eight engines
were owned by the road at that time they
were no t sabine no  calcasieu no
 lafayette no  st landry no 
grand marais no  l-ike charles no -
vermillion  no s vinton

  all in all those were happy days until
the consolidation came on and the road was
merged into one big system the southern
pacific atlantic system it then became the
wood-burner passed out the air-brake came
in yard crews up-to-date improvements the
book of standard rules the eye-test the
examinations and all the other things rele-
gated the old brakeman to the ranks of the
 has beens

  there is one thing that i wish to remark

t


the railroad mans magazine

in conclusion the hobo or weary willie
in those clays never had to ask for a ride
the order was reversed we used to in-
vite them they came in very hand at a
wood-pile and we would insist on them
wooding up while we took a rest

 twenty-four hour watches

a reader in fort william canada
sends us this bit of information re-
garding a query from j m happy texas
which we recently published

  the twenty-four hour watches are used in
western canada from fort william on-
tario to the pacific coast where the twenty-
four hour system of running trains is in use
the watch is the same as the eastern time-
piece except that just under the numbers
from k to k is  to  in large numbers

  for instance just below ik is  and be-
low  is  and below  is  so you see
one-half of the day is indicated by the out-
side numbers and the other half is indicated
by the inside numbers of course every five
minutes is marked  the outside of both
as on any other watch

   another song wanted

we have been asked to publish the words

   saves time and temper

a simplified time-table is the handi-
work of george l geiger formerly
railroad editor on the salt lake city dailies
and now an advertising and circulation spe-
cialist

  mr geigers invention - for dozens of
old-time railroaders say they have never
seen anything like it-is really a combina-
tion of time-tables

  the average traveler making a long jour-
ney finds the numerous indexes he is forced
to wade through in order to follow his
movements over different connecting lines
more puzzling than a jig-saw teaser

  the geiger time and temper saving
device is simply a time-table with every-
thing not covering the travelers movements
blocked out portions of the time-table of
each route the traveler must take arc pasted
together to show the departure of the train
taken and the arrival of this train at the
meeting-point with the connecting route

the idea is repeated just as many times as
there are transfers to be made

  mr geiger sends us a simplified time-
table covering a trip from leavenworth
kansas to san francisco half-way across
the continent the table is simplicity itself
and would be so were it covering a trip
around the world

  women especially have found the geiger
time-table of great assistance to them por-
ters find it does away with tlie constant
stream of questions usually directed at them
by lone and worrying women making long
journeys

  mr geiger extends all travelers full per-
mission to adopt his simplified time-table

sixty-five years service

when we wrote in our august issue
about gideon swain the canadian
veteran and suggested that he might be the
oldest railroad man alive we had not heard
of benjamin v smith of princeton indi-
ana mr smith is eighty-eight years old we
know that every old-timer and every man
now active in service will be interested in
him so we are publishing his letter just as
he sent it to us

  in the august number is an article headed
 oldest railroad man  will have to go
at least one better than that i was born in
harrison county indiana march  
and was raised in madison indiana from
which started the first railroad built in the
state

  i worked  the grading of the first mile
of that road in  the grade  the hill
out of madison is about one mile and a
quarter long with a raise of about four
hundred feet i worked a while on the
opening of the first deep cut on that hill
and left it to go as an apprentice to a ma-
chinist

  on june   i went into service as a
brakeman  the hill  was transferred
to machine-shop work and to act as extra
fireman on the locomotives

  in s i was promoted to locomotive
engineer and in  i was master-mechanic
of the indianapolis and perue road which
i held until it was consolidated with the
wabash when i returned to the m and i
in  i was promoted to master-mechanic
which i held until i was again consolidated
out by the union of the road with the jeffer-
sonville railroad in 

i again went as engineer  the road

i served about twenty-seven years of my
life on that road i went for a while as

engineer on what is now the branch of the
c m and d between indianapolis and
hamilton from there i went to spencer
t start a machine shop but the panic of
 was too much for me and in  i
moved with my tools to rockport indiana
and took charge of the machinery of what
was called the cincinnati rockport and
southwestern now a part of the louisville
and st louis division of the southern rail-
way and was again consolidated out by the
uniting of the road with the southern rail-
way

  i then sold my tools and went with the
mariette and north georgia railway which
wras then under construction after over a
years service there i consolidated myself
out and returned to the service of the south-
ern at this place and have been in active
service on this division about thirty-three
years

  counting from s to uo i have been
in service sixty-five years i am now a pen-
sioner  the southern railway i know
that i am the oldest railroader in indiana
as well as its oldest locomotive engineer and
master mechanic unless there is one thomas
wallace in california

  when  went into service there were but
twenty-six miles of railroad in indiana and
i knew every man  the operating force
i believe tliev arc all gone and  alone am
left

tfie question of precedence

there may be truth in the dictum that
all men are born equal blit if they stay
so it certainly is not their own fault the
argument of precedence is the grand never-
failing never-ending argument of the world

  after all it is the motor-pinion that turns
the mainshaft of life and though there are
 ball-bearings about it and it often runs
hot and makes an awful noise yet the mo-
ment it stops the driving-wheels are still and
useful activity gives place to  innocuous
desuetude

  we have again heard from one of our
friends as to who occupies the place of
glory honor renown and danger on a rail-
road-train in answer to our buffalo cor-
respondent who belittled the danger of the
mail-clerks position our friend the mail-
clerk comes along again with the following

  i am the clerk quoted in the may number
and if you can spare time and space in the
best magazine published i will try to in-
terest and probably surprise your buffalo
correspondent

  he says five men on the front end arc
killed to one mail-clerk but he is mistaken 
and if he will get the figures to prove his
side of the case i will do the same the-
real explanation is that the public usually
hears or reads of five killed on the front end


the railroad mans magazine

o one mail-clerk ask some clerk to tel
you why

  it is not a common occurrence for a mail-
clerk to find himself with his legs under the
warm side of a boiler and he does not need
a broken steam-pipe to cook the flesh on the
rest of his body fire usually caused bv
lamps in his car when the smash-up comes
will cook him overdone before he is able 
 find  himself-

  i have never tried to throw twelve tons of
coal into a fire-box ten feet long and seven
feet wide but  have often succeeded in
throwing the same amount of mail into three
hundred and fifty boxes and forty or fifty
sacks and pouches-and a great many times
without making an error

  i remember very well a wreck i was in on
a night-run in which my car caught fire from
the fire-box of the engine itself and i was
rescued by the porter and three other men
and undoubtedly saved from being roasted
alive

  as to the building of steel cars we may
live in hopes but die in despair i am
sure i have at least one more trip to make
before i get a chance to work in a steel car
and that trip may be my last-who knows

  referring again to the may number i
would like to say that i had not read the
article in the december  number when
i wrote that letter but since reading the
may number i sent for a copy and was
highly pleased with  magicians of the mail

  next to signing the pay-roll give me the
railroad mans magazine i am contin-
ually speaking a good word for it

  now let us tell you something in confi-
dence we have held with becoming grav-
ity this editorial throttle for many moons
we have heard arguments about the bra-
very of the engineer and the danger of
his position the bravery of the fireman
and the danger of his position the bravery
of the conductor and brakeman and the
danger of their positions and the bravery

of the call-boy and die danger of his earthly
calling

  i f anybody ought to know we guess we
ought well-we dont the only decision
we can come to is that of the old farmer as
he gazed  the rhinoceros at the zoo
 there aint no sich animal 

  human beings are pretty much alike and
the difference is very often the merest
chance for instance a wreck seems im-
minent the engineer gives her sand and
air the fireman is just about to climb down
to break the coupling the con is getting
ready to save his passengers the postal
clerk looks sadly at the love-letters he has
just sorted-all are primed and ready when
the engine bumps gently into the rear end
of the obstructing freight and nobody is in-
jured but a pup in the baggage-car who gets
it in the neck with a hundred-and-fifty-
pound trunk

  perhaps a train piles up gently over the
body of a sleeping cow and nobody is killed
except the cow and a passenger in the rear
car who falls through a window and is
drowned in a ditch

  thus fate comes along and kicks the legs
from under theory and proves that the most
dangerous place on a train is where it isnt
and that the most dangerous occupation is
that of the crossing-tender who doesnt need
to go within ten feet of anything on wheels

  there are too many exceptions to have a
rule but of this we are convinced rail-
roading is an occupation which calls for real
men in all its branches it is an occupation
in which hardship and danger call for
strength and wit and courage and we are
also convinced that every railroad man is
strong calm and defiant of circumstances
in whatever position accident or chance may
place him where all are excellent there is
no best

a living from poultry

 from  hens in ten months
    on

to the average poultrv-
man that would seem
impossible and when we
tell you that we have
actually done a 
poultry business with 
hens  a corner in the
city garden  feet wide
by  feet lung we are
simply stating facts it
woula not be possible to
get such returns by any-
one of the systems of
poultry keeping recom-
mended and practiced by
the american people
till it is an easy matter
when the new

 philo
 system

is adopted

the philo system is unlike all other
ways of keeping poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in poul-
try work that have always been considered impossible and getting
unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches
of the work necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it tells how
to get eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg ami how
to raise nearly all the chicks hatched it gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business a d it
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner

two pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square foot to the broiler without
any loss and the broilers are of the very best quality bringing here
three cents per pound above the highest market price

our six-months-old pullets are laying
at the rate of  eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of
any description is led and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

our new nook the philo system of poultry keeping gives
full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple
easy-to-understand directions thar are right t the point and  pages
of illustrations showing all branches of the work from start to finish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

one of our secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are
fully developed at hatching time whether they can crack the shell
or not it is a simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled them to sell the
chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at  cents a bushel

our book tells how to make the bet green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply any day in the year winter or sum-
mer it is just as impossible to set a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on
each chicken

no lamp required no danger of chilling overheating or burn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
tire they also keep all the lice off the chickens automatically or
kill any that may be on them when placed in the brooder our
book gives full plans and the right to make and use them one
can easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents

it turns out seamen electricians machinists carpenters gunners
etc the man who serves an enlistment creditably and receives
an honorable discharge is able not only to do his work properly in the navy or in civil life but h
reliant and resourceful that is where the navy training counts

    there is room for him to advance in the navy should he wish to leave the service after one enlistment
he is equipped to get a better job at better pay than he was before he enlisted

    tiie navy offers advantages to men who have a trade even if inly partially learned why not make
yourself a master at your trade and get paid while doing it 

    you can save money there too in the navy everything you really need is given you free most men
can save more in the navy than they can in civil life and there is every facility for depositing savings without
expense or trouble at -ir interest
