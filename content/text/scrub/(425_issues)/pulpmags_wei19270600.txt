i heck father rooney
chuckled deep in his throat
and lifted his hand irom the
knight that had just made an unex-
pected foray among his opponents
pieces

  the old doctor leaned over the
board to study the situation carefully
it does look as though you had me
he admitted unwillingly well next
time you may not have such good
luck

   luck queried the priest softly
a whimsical smile curving his lips

   poor papa you are always beat-
ing him father reproached a soft
voice from the other end of the room

   the floor lamp illuminated a nar-
row circle about the chess players and
but dimly disclosed a little figure that
pressed against the curtain at the
open window as though to escape ob-
servation from without as well as


no-no- she screamed and sank back
unconscious into the arms of her father

 from within against the wall behind

 her the polished surface of a pair of
 crutches caught the light in long lines
 it was characteristic of clare that she
 should put unpleasant things behind
 her

   the face she turned occasionally to-
 ward the chess players disclosed sin-
 gular beauty even in the softly dif-
 fused light of the big lamp one saw
 dark sensitive eyes and felt the ten-
 derness of the habitual gentle smile
 that made her expression so attrac-
 tive her low forehead was shaded
 by light brown hair that fell over her
 small ears and was knotted loosely at
 the nape of a slender neck but
 clares real beauty lay in the spirit-
 uality that beamed from her eyes

   there was a brilliant moon clare
 gazing out into the garden thought
 she had never seen it as strange as it
 seemed that night it was a mysteri-
 ous dreamland not the garden she
 knew it was full of unexpected
 patches of light that changed shape
 imperceptibly as the moon swam up-
a suitor from the shades



ward across the sky and against
these light spots outlining them ab-
ruptly were massively upreared
structures of ebony-black shadow
the garden she thought she knew so
well was like an unknown entirely
new country and one that oddly
enough seemed to hold a dark threat
in those ominous shadows that crept
upon and engulfed the moonlit spots
that relieved its blackness

  a slow shudder crept over the
slight figure of the lame girl who
leaned back instinctively against the
curtain and toward the soft and
homely light of the tall lamp beneath
which sat her father and his old
friend at their game of chess still
her gaze was held by the garden in
its new aspect

  out of the black shadows a figure
advanced into a moonlit space and
like some goddess of the night lifted
slim arms to her sister queen floating
in her cloud chariot overhead out
upon the hush of the night floated the
rich notes clare so adored ah
she murmured with a kind of relief
in her voice margaret is going to
sing  

  the song was ned wentworths
ode to the queen of night it was
the favorite lyric in neds last mu-
sical comedy then crowding one of
new yorks best theaters night after
night incidentally filling neds pock-
ets with gold clare closed her eyes
that the velvet tones might have their
full effect upon her entranced senses

  at the other end of the room the
chess players stopped their game to
listen the chess board carefully bal-
anced across their old knees father
rooney characteristically lifted his
kindly eyes heavenward although his
physical gaze was limited by the low
ceiling the old doctors eyes went
straight to the great portrait that
hung over the divan the portrait of
his dead wife

  for clare the evil spell lying upon
the garden was broken the strange

enchantment with its vague threat
passed away at the thrill of that dear
voice as the tones died away on a
lingering high note she turned her
face upon her sister and opened her
eyes margaret was apparently all
alone in the still night and the lonely
garden the chess players had re-
sumed their game the lame girl could
hear their occasional low murmurs

 where can ned be she ques-
tioned as she gazed

  ned wentworth had been standing
in the black shadow of a great walnut
tree watching the throbbing of mar-
garets full throat as her rich notes
poured out their benediction upon the
still night air his heart expanded
so painfully that it seemed it must
burst her beauty actually hurt him
he looked hungrily at the great coils
of heavy auburn hair gleaming with
gold under the magical light of the
autumn moon he saw as if for the
first time the healthy pallor of her
clear skin thrown into relief as she
lifted her face upward in her invoca-
tion to the queen of night he fol-
lowed the line of the fine throat that
swept into and was absorbed by the
noble curve of her bust and he
clenched his fists with his effort to
control himself-he felt that he could
no longer refrain from telling her how
madly lie loved her

  he stepped impulsively toward her
as the last gorgeous notes quivered
upon the cool silence and died softly
away she paused hands still out-
stretched as she had stood while sing-
ing lost in the maze of emotion that
had suddenly swept over her at neds
impulsive movement rich scarlet
began to mount in her cheeks until
they blazed hotly under the tranquil
light of the cold lady of night into
the broad sweep of moonlight beside
her stepped her lover his gray eyes
almost black with the intensity of his
feeling he did not speak nor did she
it appeared to them that they had


weird tales

 both been waiting for this very mo-
 ment all their lives

    margaret was quite motionless her
  head very high dark eyes on his
 face steadily gravely as if the
 wonder and richness of her emotion
 were too great to be carried off lightly
 ned took another step forward a
 movement that brought her still out-
 stretched arms to his shoulders upon
 which her light palms dropped ten-
 derly

   margie then it is true you
 love me

    he swept her into his embrace her
 arms met about his neck and he felt
 her hands caressing his hair sudden
 self-consciousness fell upon them
 and they drew back into the shade
 of the walnut lest they be observed
 from the house



 with such careless haste that the
 chessmen were tossed hither and
 thither father rooney sprang from
 his chair and across the room

   what ails our little girl cried
  the old priest deeply disturbed

    dr sloane got out of his chair with
  more difficulty sciatica had made a
  semi-invalid of him for months he
  joined the other man who leaned over
  clare the blond head lay on out-
  stretched arms across the window-sill
  so motionless was she that for a ter-
  rible moment her father felt the
  clutching fear which his love for the
  daughter so like his dead wife made
  more terrible

   the priest held a listening ear
 against the giils side she lives
 old friend herheart is beating-but
 sluggishly let me carry her to the
 divan where she will be more com-
 fortable it is only a fainting spell  
 father rooney knew well the name
 of the fear that was lifting a grisly
 head in his friends breast and his
 heart ached for the old doctor who
 followed him haltingly and painfully
 as he carried the limp little form

across the room and disposed it on the
broad divan sitting beside her the
priest began to stroke clares hands
softly while her father held a bottle
of salts under her nose

  the lame girl stirred feebly then
suddenly she broke out into hysterical
sobbing so heart-racking and so piti-
ful that tears rose to the eyes of the
old priest who had seen so much
heard so much of human suffering
that one felt he must have grown
hardened by it now however he sat
stroking a limp cold hand and hot
tears slowly formed in his eyes and
dropped upon it

  he loved clare as though she had
been his own child hers was a rare
soul that knew and appreciated the
lofty truths in his church just as she
recognized and loved the same un-
changeable truths that formed the
foundation of the faith of her fathers
for so young a girl she was only
nineteen clare possessed a lucidity
of thought and a fairness of judg-
ment that made her especially inter-
esting to the good priest who secretly
believed her one of gods favored
souls

  she has never been like this be-
fore worried dr sloane wrinkled
brow troubled clare dear clare
its dad calling you dear clare

  the girls sobbing increased in in-
tensity her body began to writhe on
the divan as if in sharp agony the
priest in father rooney lifted an at-
tentive ear to the undertones of this
sobbing that somehow fell strangely
upon that clerical ear he felt intui-
tively that here was a matter of soul
trouble not a mere hysterical weak-
ness on clares part and he was
deeply disturbed

  suddenly he looked up sharply and
threw a searching glance about the
room his eye met that of dr sloane
who had also looked about quickly

  i would have sworn that there
was someone else in the room just
now said the doctor in a puzzled
a suitor from the shades



tone as he met his friends gaze
didnt you feel it yourself

  the expression of the priests face
was troubled a very unpleasant
someone if you care for my opinion  
he declared dryly   i presume it was
the effect on us of our poor little
clares hysterics he offered but
without conclusiveness

  clare had become quiet and lay
very still at last her dark eyes
opened heavily and she searched the
solicitous faces of the two men con-
tritely   sorry i made such a fuss  
she murmured it wasnt like me
was it i-i dont know what hap-
pened to me it-it wasnt like a
heart attack it was as if something
from outside had robbed me of all my
strength in an unguarded moment
she paused her lips parted as if to
say more then closed firmly

  father rooneys brow wrinkled
ever so slightly a half-puzzled ex-
pression that had rested on his face
a moment past returned he looked
gravely at the delicate beauty of the
face on the divan cushion her last
words-and her silence-had dis-
turbed him far more than he cared
to admit to himself for some strange
reason they seemed ominous it was
with an effort that he threw off his
depression to meet the two radiant
faces that now looked in at the door

  father ned and i- whats

the matter is anything the matter
with clare margaret sprang from
the encircling arm of her lover to
kneel at the side of the divan the
shadow that always lay though ever
so lightly upon her younger sister
was a dread shadow and its gloom
now drew fringes of trailing darkness
across the bliss of her new happiness

  its quite nothing margie dar-
ling dont be frightened anyway
im all right now clare hastened to
reassure her

  then with characteristic self-for-
getfulness-and none but the wise old
priest knew how generous was her

spirit at that moment-clare put out
her hand to ned

  you and margie-love each other
how beautiful forgive me if i cry
im just glad youre both so happy
she turned her face against the pil-
low and began to cry softly so dif-
ferent was it from her previous hys-
terical weeping that the priest drew a
small half-smothered sigh of relief
he rose touching with kindly bene-
diction the soft haix

  good night clare good night
all i must be on my way

    but you havent congratulated us
yet interrupted margaret spiing-
ing to her feet and turning a beam-
ing face upon him

  may heaven send you its richest
blessings my daughter he told her
gravely and you too mr went-
worth his hand went out to ned
in a hearty handshake

  dr sloane had sunk into a near-by
armchair reminded painfully of his
sciatica by twinges that doubled him
up after his recent exertions he
waved one hand at the departing
cleric

  i really need a hankie apolo-
gized clare comically from the depths
of her cushion ned whipped out one
and tried to dry her eyes in big-
brotherly fashion i can do it bet-
ter she said

  ned suddenly threw a quick glance
at the door did someone come
in he asked the doctor

  no one

  thats strange i felt someone
looking at me from the doorway
ned youre dreaming tonight
margaret rallied him laughing he
felt eyes on him while we were in the
garden  

  then they must have been mine
clare said sitting up   i was watch-
ing margaret while she sang

  ned and margaret exchanged
glances both colored and laughed
but clares pale face remained impas-
sive they exchanged glances again


weird tales

clare could not have seen that first
rapture of their love after all



it was nearly midnight when the
sisters finally retired to the room
they shared together there had
been a bottle of old port opened that
the healths of the young pair might
be toasted and it seemed that the
hours had only been minutes to mar-
garet

  clare darling ive kept you up
awfully late tonight   she apologized
with compunction turning a flushed
happy face to her sister you should
have been in bed ages ago 

  this is a special night margie
wasnt it magnificent margar-
ets voice dropped into an almost sol-
emn key as she stopped brushing out
her wonderful auburn hair it
seemed to - us - that there had
never been such a night before  

  i thought much the same but
margie did it seem to you-dont tell
me im imagining things please-
did it seem to you that there was
something strange something almost
awful about the beauty of the garden
tonight i was really afraid of it
and i have never felt that way be-
fore but tonight it actually seemed
that there was a presence abroad a
presence that boded no good to some-
one

 margaret her smooth forehead
wrinkled whirled about suddenly to
face her sister

 thats odd she commented
bruskly   ned complained of the very
same feeling he declared that he
felt jealous envious eyes upon him
clare tumbled over into bed and
turned her face from her sister she
slipped something under her pillow
as she did so-it was neds handker-
chief in a smothered voice she said
margie that was not a heart at-
tack i had this evening

  clare dear you are dreaming if

it wasnt a heart attack what was
it

  that is just what i would give
worlds to know answered the other
girl earnestly margie there was
something strange in our garden to-
night something no one could see-
but it was there nevertheless and
-i know what it was oh dont
turn out the light margie i just
cant sleep in the dark tonight

  such unusual timidity on clares
part made margaret look at her sister
searchingly then she sat on the
edge of the bed and began to smooth
the brown hair gently

  and what was it you saw in the
garden she inquired with a touch
of light humor in her tone

  i didnt see i just felt but
something took all my strength out
of me suddenly it was as if some-
thing else had clothed itself with my
body only my body didnt go with it
into the garden it stayed inside
but i knew - i know - all that
that other saw and did	

    dearest you are overwrought and
tired this glorious night has thrown
a spell over you and it has been too
much for your tired little head 
margie clare drew herself up
to a sitting posture do you re-
member clifford bentley    there
was so much significance in her tone
that the older girl gave her an
amazed look as she replied affirma-
tively

  margie clifford bentley was in
the garden tonight spying on you
and ned

  for a moment margaret regarded
her sister with a kind of terror then
she broke into a soft laugh

  oh come now clare that is too
much to ask me to believe clifford
bentley has been dead many years
quite too dead poor boy to come
wandering about our garden

  but he was there persisted
clare stubbornly i tell you mar-
gie i felt him there please dont
a suitor from the shades



laugh i am quite serious oh why
cant you understand dont you
remember his last words to you

  margarets face paled under the
warm color and she stared wide-eyed
at her sister

    i remember-i was to remain
true to him until death joined us and
if  did not-but clare how ab-
surd he a mere boy of fifteen and
i an infant of eleven it is so ridicu-
lous that i cant help laughing dear-
est  

  it isnt ridiculous protested
clare unhappily but positively   be-
cause he may be able to cause trouble
between you and ned yet you
know margie you owe your life to
clifford-and if it had not been for
you he would he alive and well
now

  clare you are positively idiotic
tonight i must insist that you go
to sleep and get rid of your morbid
thoughts why should you try to
spoil my wonderful night the most
beautiful of my life

tvtargaret withdrew pettishly and
-ll a few minutes afterward clare
heard her tucking herself into her
own bed that stood on the other side
of their common reading stand
slowly the lame girl slipped down
into her bed again but her eyes did
not close still she was not looking
at the picture which she stared at
she was looking back across the years
to the time when margaret was eleven
and she was nine-and clifford bent-
ley fifteen

  it was a boy-and-girl love affair
-precocious to be sure clifford
adored the little tomboy with her mop
of brilliant hair and her impulsive-
ness and her enchanting ways she
had let him put his seal ring upon
her engagement finger in return
for his promise to give her a ride
on his iceboat that had been a won-
derful sport then the tragic mo-
ment came when the thin ice broke

under a too-sudden turn of the skele-
ton craft and botli children had been
thrown into the icy water by the
shock it was clifford who first came
to the surface it was he who dived
and groped under the ice for mar-
garet who brought her unconscious
to the surface

  when rescue came the boys coat
was wrapped about the girls shiver-
ing form both children had had
pneumonia from the exposure but it
was clifford who had not survived it
his last words to his mother had been
for margaret   tell her i expect her
to be true to me until death joins us
if she is not true i shall come back
to remind her of her promise

  clare reviewing the pathetic and
tragic little story felt deep sympathy
for clifford clifford who had given
his life for margaret and was now
forgotten she too would gladly
have done the same she lay very
quiet although she did not sleep

  as she heard the library clock
chime the hours once twice she sud-
denly moved the handkerchief and
pressed it against her lips as she
did it she breathed out a prayer for
ned wentworth and his happiness
then with a little sigh she slipped
softly off to sleep



ned wentworth could not sleep
he filled his pipe and settled
down before the hearth where glowed
the urbanites humble apology for a
wood-fire a gas log he had felt it
impossible to write while he was fresh
from the sweet influence of mar-
garets presence he wanted to think
over his happiness also he wanted
to think over another thing-an in-
tuition he had had of a something
sinister hovering near while he had
been in the garden with margaret

  exactly as he had told his sweet-
heart he had felt burning envious
malignant eyes fixed upon him from


weird tales

the black shadows of the garden
even when lie had taken margaret
into the lighted room he had felt this
entity near at hand who could it
be that was trying to penetrate his
objective consciousness so strangely
who could be so bitter against the
man who had won margarets love
except some rival he entertained
not the slightest doubt that it was an
unsuccessful rival whose bitter envy
he had felt but who

  he remembered distinctly that in
the moment margaret had finished
her song turning to him with all her
soul in her eyes he had felt as though
someone stood between them some-
one about whose person he must
pass to reach her who could this
individual be who was interested in
separating two young people so emi-
nently suited to each other ned
simply could not understand the sit-
uation yet felt that it was a tangible
situation the fact that this un-
known person was strong enough to
make his unseen presence strongly
felt was sufficient to give thought to
the young lover but an invisible
rival could not long occupy neds
thoughts to the exclusion of pleas-
anter things he mused and smoked
while the hours fled

  the clock struck one simultane-
ously ned wentworth sprang as if
catapulted out of his chair and
whirled around to face the door in
full expectancy of seeing a stranger
there the doorway was vacant it
framed nothing but empty air the
young mans eye roved the apartment
with keen scrutiny there was noth-
ing more suspicious than a tall screen
that served to hide his writing desk
from the rest of the room upon this
screen neds glance finally rested
with curious intentness then he
shook himself impatiently and again
sat down before the hearth the im-
pression of a strange presence was so
strong however that he was induced

to move his chair so that he faced
the screen

 for fully five minutes he sat
motionless smoking then he rose
went directly to the screen whirled
it aside and looked behind it no-
body there furious at himself for
entertaining the thought of a discar-
nate personality he yet found him-
self considering it he was actually
angry because he had given the un-
known the satisfaction of seeing him
look behind the screen when he re-
turned to his place before the hearth
he deliberately turned his chair so
that the screen was behind him

  he refilled his pipe and touched a
match to it nonchalantly stealing in-
sidiously into his mind came thoughts
of the girl who sang his ode to the
queen of night at the performances
in the bedford theater she was
slight and graceful lacking mar-
garets robust fearless poise dainty
and petite while margaret was almost
too heavy to be graceful she was
charmingly pretty and knew just
how to make herself fascinating
while margaret made not the slight-
est pretext at using beauty aids
such as rouge which with her dead-
white skin would be so attractive
beatrice randall knew how to charm
and faseinate a man ned reflected
with a slow smile margaret unfor-
tunately was entirely without that
subtle mystery that feminine art and
guile that attracts the male so posi-
tively beatrice would go any length
to enchant an admirer margaret
would have considered such efforts
beneath her on the whole thought
ned when margaret sang his ode she
appeared a proud and unapproach-
able goddess when beatrice sang it
she was a most approachable en-
ticing and desirable woman

  instinctively wentworth glanced
up at the mantel shelf where a
framed portrait of margaret stood
as he looked his brow contracted a
puzzled almost startled expression
a suitor from the shades



flitted over his face he put down
his pipe incredulous indignant re-
morseful he reached for the photo-
graph and carried it to his lips

  three hours engaged he said
and whistled   three hours engaged
-and beginning to criticize mar-
garet comparing her with another
woman who isnt fit to tie her shoes
what on earth has got into me

  then he remembered the entrance
of that sinister presence a few min-
utes ago furious indignation swept
over him as he began to realize what
had taken place the thing was intol-
erable a gust of futile anger shook
him    someone with a deep in-
terest in margaret sloane was at-
tempting telepathically to turn his
mind from her and toward some
other woman he put margarets
portrait on the table beside him and
clenched his fists as he faced about
toward the empty room

  aloud he exclaimed whoever
you are that is trying to separate
margaret and me you can not pre-
vail we love each other you may as
well be off my invisible rival for i
am on my guard now he laughed
grimly but shamefacedly at his spo-
ken words they seemed absurd ad-
dressed to thin air but he had the
feeling that whatever or whoever it
was that had entered his room and
had actually succeeded for a few min-
utes in swaying his thoughts this
personality would understand-if not
his words his intentions

  he looked long at margarets por-
trait his lips parting in a tender
smile who could compare with
her ah there was never such a
glorious girl how could he have
thought otherwise even for a pass-
ing moment to be sure she was
a bit over-independent and a man
enjoys the clinging-vine type of
woman for a sweetheart beatrice
randall was just such a helpless little
thing with all her guile and her fem-
inine arts a man felt he must look

after the child how appealingly
feminine she was when she sang his
ode in that entrancing little girl
way of hers no wonder it always
brought down the house now mar-
garet had a way of surrounding her-
self with such an atmosphere of in-
dependence of proud confidence in
herself that a man almost felt he
would be entirely superfluous in her
life now that she was engaged to
be married it would not be such a
bad idea for her to cultivate a little
more of the womanly attitude of
helpless dependence that was so
pretty in beatrice

  ned had been pacing back and
forth he stopped and stood stock-
still the sickening realization swept
over him that once more the un-
known rival had entered into his
secret thoughts and swung them away
from margaret it was too much
he caught up a hat and stick and
went out of the house to walk about
under the stars perhaps the pres-
ence would tire of following him
about in the open it may have been
so it may also have been that the
unknown had done all he cared to do
for one night after a brisk hours
walk ned found his mind cleared of
its cobwebs and he went home to
sleep soundly



tiith daylight neds recollections

v	 of his uncanny experience faded
as dreams in ones first waking mo-
ments he remembered only that he
had unaccountably given more
thought to the prima donna in his
musical comedy than he had ever
given that damsel before or ever
would again he told himself

  ostensibly to inquire about clare
but in reality to assure himself of his
happiness he telephoned margaret
early

  clares all right but shes wor-
rying herself sick over an utterly ri-


weird tales

diculous fancy an absurd thing she
declares took place last night
what was tharr neds voice
was vaguely troubled

  some kind of ghostly visitor who
she insists visited us last night dad
is encouraging her yes he is he
declares that lie and father rooney
felt the presence of an outsider in
the room last night when clare had
that fainting spell for my own
part i felt nothing i consider the
whole subject too utterly absurd for
discussion  

  not as ridiculous as it may seem
at first glance dear ned replied
hesitantly a sudden flood of memory
rushing upon him carrying convic-
tion with it i had a rather strange
experience last night myself even
as he said it he hoped margaret
would not insist upon details how
would it sound in her ears that he
had spent hours thinking about some
other woman when he had just en-
gaged himself to her

 what happened ned

  really the thing was so intang-
ible that it would be extremely diffi-
cult to put it into words hedged
wentworth desperately perhaps
when i see you i can explain better
than i can over the telephone now
this excuse appearing reasonable
margaret did not insist further much
to neds relief but the girl was far
more troubled after this conversation
than she cared to admit to herself
she fidgeted about the house wishing
it were evening in the evening
father rooney would surely be over
to inquire about her sister and she
wanted to hear from his own lips if
he had felt any supernatural experi-
ence the night before

  margaret scoffed at the ridiculous
idea that a boy of fifteen should come
back from the dead to keep her from
marrying another man even granted
that the boy had attained manhood
in another world in the meantime
her keen sense of humor and her

abounding good health combined to
restrain her thoughts from wild sur-
mises she merely wondered if some
contagion of diseased thought had
fastened upon the others of her im-
mediate circle leaving her untouched
this seemed far more probable to
her than that the veil separating the
visible and invisible worlds could
have been lifted to permit the en-
trance into her life of a long-dead
boy sweetheart

  she did not have to wait until eve-
ning to see the old priest about 
oclock she saw him entering the
garden he stopped to speak with
clare who was basking in the sun-
shine

 cobwebs brushed away he
asked the lame girl pointedly

  she colored but met his eyes brave-
ly oh yes father

  he looked keenly at her slightly
clouded face perhaps there is
something i can do for you my
child

  im afraid you would be the last
one to help me she laughed rue-
fully i want to find out the name
and address of a good psychic i
must talk with someone who under-
stands-supernatural things there
is an influence abroad that bodes evil
to ned-and to my sister she add-
ed hastily lowering her eyes before
the kindly scrutiny of the priest

  i wish i could help you clare
he paused a moment considering
if you were only a catholic my
child he added regretfully

  but it isnt religious help that i
want father what i need is some-
thing that i dont believe you could
give me if i only knew what to
do

  cant you leave it in higher
hands than those of a mere mortal
my daughter if you can do that
with your whole heart the problem
will be solved for you you believe
that do you not

  she nodded slowly and thought-
a suitor from the shades



fully the old man passed a caress-
ing hand over her brown locks
sighed and went up the path with
knit brow

  margaret impatiently waiting for
him was standing at the top of the
porch steps

  ned called up this morning
father she said abruptly he per-
sists in saying that he had an un-
canny experience last night my sis-
ter says the same and dad father
rooney do you believe that a man
can come back from the dead in these
days   

  why in these days he in-
quired whimsically these days
differ in no way from other days
margaret they are all a part of eter-
nity

  but do you

  what difference would it make
margaret what i believe in the
olden days did not someone ask that
same question it is in holy writ
margaret  

  you are evading my question
father the girl cried with an im-
patient shake of her head

  what do you think margaret
asked the old priest mildly

  i dont know what to think
clare says it is true ned-why i
actually believe he would agree with
her dad too tell me did you feel
someone in the room with us last
night someone we couldnt see

  her question was sufficiently
pointed this time for father rooney
to get the drift of her inquiry he
smiled

  my child a priest becomes very
intuitive and senses presences good
and evil that other people do not or-
dinarily feel it is his study his ar-
dent prayers his meditations alone
that make him more sensitive and
a man who employs his brain in crea-
tive work as does mr wentworth is
also liable to psychic impressions
your dear father-why he is a phy-

sician and a good physician must be
intuitive while as for our little
clare-ah her physical disability has
kept her very near the unseen you
can trust her intuitions margaret
how about me scornfully
you arc far less liable to such
delicate impressions because you are
in robust health your employments
are active physical employments
your outlook upon life is-well my
child largely material there   and
he raised a hand to still her quick
protest you have not yet had a
sorrow my child when you have
suffered disillusion disappointment
grief-then perhaps you will find
yourself closer than now to the veil
that hides the unseen

  in other words father the rest
of you felt that there was a spook in
the room but for me that spook
didnt exist

  something like that margaret
something like that i dont know
but that you are better off than we
are in that respect it is not always
a pleasant thing to have these other
entities thrust themselves upon ones
notice without invitation

  well with a slightly scornful
laugh when i see a spirit i shall
believe that they exist and return to
earth but i fear i shall never be con-
vinced by my own good eyes

  little did margaret dream as she
spoke so skeptically under what cir-
cumstances her own good eyes were
to teach her the frailness of the veil
that separates the material and the
spiritual worlds

  father rooney shook one finger at
the young girl in half-playful admo-
nition

  i wish there were some way to
help my little clare he murmured
to himself as he went on into the
house she is too susceptible to
psychic influences may our lady
watch over her he finished softly
and earnestly


weird tales



xhy there comes mrs campbell

  v	v across the road i wonder what
she wants margaret went slowly
down the path to meet the visitor
stopping at clares side to drop her
gentle hands on the lame girls
drooping shoulders

  the woman who came briskly up
the bricked path was short and rather
heavily built without being actually
stout her graying hair was pulled
back tightly from her round face and
drawn into a figure eight at the
nape of the neck although her face
had not the slightest trace of actual
beauty her features were prepossess-
ing there was about her that atmos-
phere of homely and agreeable
motherliness that warms the heart
she wore a starched white linen
shirtwaist and a pepper-and-salt
tailored skirt to the black belt of
which was hooked a chatelaine bag
of black leather stout black shoes
completed her utilitarian rather than
handsome clothes

  as she approached the sisters
clare leaned forward with a kind of
breathless interest her eyes fixed up-
on the newcomer a mixture of
anxiety and expectation appeared on
the lame girls face

  mrs campbell did not speak until
she was directly up to the girls it
would have been most unlike her to
have wasted her energy upon the
balmy afternoon air by speaking
when there was a possibility of not
being heard perfectly

  well margaret and clare good
afternoon both of you clare i
came over especially to see you she
said abruptly

  margaret laughed musically
well that is unkind of you mrs
campbell she said am i to take
that as a summary dismissal

  you can stay if you like mar-
garet but im thinking that you
would not believe a word im going

to say and i dont choose to give
you the chance to laugh at me mar-
garet sloane

  clare gasped audibly margaret
although accustomed to her scotch
neighbors frankness pretended to be
offended

  really mrs campbell if you
think me incapable of appreciating
your pearls of wisdom-

  she moved off with her swinging
easy walk leaving clare gazing after
her with troubled eyes the lame
girl was deeply disturbed and it was
not until margaret turned to throw
her half-mocking smile that she real-
ized her sisters pique was more ap-
parent than real

  the scotchwoman went directly to
the heart of her message

  my dear do you know that there
was a stranger in your garden last
night  

  then you saw him gasped the
girl starting involuntarily at the
others words

  ah you know then

  i-i felt his presence admit-
ted clare

  well i saw him and i hope i
dont see him again he isnt a
pleasant individual dryly do
you know who he is clare spirits
like that dont usually trouble hu-
man beings unless there is some
powerful tie between them be frank
with me my dear i may be able
to help you and i foresee that you
may need help you and margaret
too

  clare drew a long breath his
name if im not mistaken is clif-
ford bentley she began and she
plunged into the forlorn little story
of the childhood romance with its
tragic ending her listener nodded
understandingly

  do you think he intends to make
any trouble for my sister asked
the lame girl anxiously

  im afraid he does clare ill
tell you what i saw he was looking
a suitor from the shades



over your shoulder into the garden
at margaret suddenly he leaned
over you and you disappeared in a
cloud of luminous vapor but the
luminosity clare was not that light
shed from the aura of an entity that
is trying to uplift itself or others
it was the murky red-shot vapor
that betrayed the presence of evil

   whether it is evil for you or for
margaret matters little for that
entity has taken advantage of your
physical weakness your psychic sus-
ceptibility your unselfish nature and
unless you can beat off his influence
you will end by becoming little better
than the instrument by which that
evil thing will eventually seek to
make its actual physical appearance
among us

mrs campbell you terrify me
i terrify myself said the lady
dryly   if you only could have seen
that evil atmosphere that enveloped

you- the pause was eloquent

clare met it with understanding
eyes

  it was that i felt then it was
that which robbed me of conscious-
ness oh dear mrs campbell you
have the wonderful gift of second-
sight cant you tell me what this
all means why has he come back
the scotchwoman nodded with the
half-proud half-mortified air of one
who admits something to ones detri-
ment which yet one can not help but
consider a merit

  yes clare i have the second-
sight my mother had it and my
grandmother before her its a won-
derful thing as you say-but not
such a pleasant thing sometimes
tell me what to do wont you
i know mr campbell hates to have
you exercise your power-but-isnt
this an exceptional occasion begged
the lame girl

  clare ill try she glanced
cautiously at the house as she spoke
to ascertain if margaret were in sight
you know i can not promise suc-

cess it is for this that i can not dis-
cuss the thing with your sister mar-
garet is so skeptical that i would be
quite uneasy in her presence and un-
able to let myself go as i must it i
wish to go into a trance

  she moved closer to the girl   give
me your two hands my dear she
commanded gently her voice seeming
already to come from a distance
she stood perfectly stiff for a mo-
ment while the lame girls whole soul
was watching in her eyes

  there was not the slightest sus-
picion in clares mind as to the
seeress honesty the sloanes had
known the campbells for more than
seven years and no one in the sub-
urb had anything but admiration and
respect for the little scotchwoman
douglas campbell while admitting
his wifes gift of second-sight was
stubbornly set against her use of it
he believed it a weakening and un-
healthy practise even when exercised
by an effort of the will in this
laura campbell differed from her
husband but was too docile a wife
to question his well-meant authority
-at least in public it is a fact that
when she felt herself justified she
had no hesitation in yielding to her
intuitions and in the case of the
sloane girls her friendliness for them
drove her to seek them out for the
purpose for she had seen plainly
that the uninvited guest of the pre-
vious night was an undesirable and
might prove a troublesome visitor

after a long moment during which
clare felt her heart beating
loudly and painfully the scotch-
woman began to speak her intona-
tion was stiff and harsh the very op-
posite of her customary rapid easy
speech the words dropped off her
lips slowly one by one with mono-
tonous regularity meantime her
hands gripped those of the lame
girl with a grip that made clare
wince

  oh clare sloane cried out sud-
denly as if in acute pain

  the seeress gave a deep sigh shud-
dered from head to foot and closed
her eyes tightly then she released
the hands she had been holding so
tightly and opened her eyes to see
the lame girl laboring for breath her
head thrown back on the cushions

  margaret  margaret bring your
sisters tablets

  mrs campbell began to stroke and
beat at one of the delicate hands
while she looked anxiously toward
the house margaret came running
down the path a glass of water in
one hand and clares medicine in the
other she threw a reproachful look
at their neighbor as she hastily be-
gan to minister to her sister

  what on earth did you tell clare
to upset her like this asked the
older girl indignantly

  im sorry margaret but i cant
tell you what upset her

  you mean you wont tell me
flashed the girl

  no i mean just what i said
shes reviving-look the color is
coming into her cheeks again
what did you do did you try
any of that trance business
clare asked me to try it for her
replied the other woman quickly   it
was to help her out about some-
thing she hesitated

  and you mean to tell me scorn-
fully that you dont know what
you tokl her

-	youre going a little too far
margaret rebuked the scotch-

woman indignant in her turn im
not accustomed to having my word
disputed if you knew anything at
all about the nature of a trance you
would know that the medium is
never aware of what is said

  oh i believe you hastily
clare darling are you feeling bet-
ter now

  clare was breathing more natural-
ly and her cheeks were not as pal-
lid as they had been a moment since
her hands were still cold to the so-
licitous margarets touch and the
girl began chafing them clare as
soon as she could speak began to
beg brokenly oh can you tell me
what he meant was it you talk-
ing or was it he speaking with
your lips

 he mrs campbells lips
parted she looked strangely at the
lame girl what did i say tell
me everything clare dont forget
a single word

  clare repeated it to the best of her
ability

  i dont like that said the
scotchwoman anxiously he means
that while you live he can control
you psychically gathering from you
the force to make himself felt un-
pleasantly on this plane the alter-
native is and she directed her gaze
sharply and narrowly at margaret
who colored under it resentfully
the alternative is that margaret
keeps her vow to him her vow never
to marry

  in other words mrs campbell
my sister must pay for my happiness
with her life or i must pay for her
life with my happiness  excuse me  
coldly but i think you go too far
with this mysterious jargon come
clare dear the sun is sinking let
me help you into the house

  the scotchwoman silently assisted
in drawing clare to her feet and ad-
justed the crutches while margaret
picked up the cushions upon which
the lame girl had been reclining as
a suitor from the shades



  the sisters went slowly up the path
  to the house she stood watching
  them with perturbed countenance

    its bad its very very bad
  and margaret wont believe the
  peril she is in poor clare i must
  tell douglas of this if it comes to
  the worst hell have to permit me
  to make up a circle and dr sloane
  will have to override margarets ob-
  jections-for object she surely will
  unless she falls into the sphere of
  influence of that unwelcome guest
  herself i can only watch-and
  pray she whispered to herself



 ned wentworth was an impul-
 sive lover moreover his un-
 canny obsession on the  night of
 his engagement to margaret had
 weighed on his mind he felt that the
  sooner they were married the sooner
 the unseen rival for the girls affec-
 tions would be induced to leave the
 field to him he lost no time there-
 fore in urging an early marriage
 upon margaret

    his plans met with dr sloanes
  approval the old man was relieved
  to see at least one of his girls hap-
  pily married and provided for in
  secret he grieved much for his
  younger daughter whose lameness
  might prove a serious obstacle to her
  satisfactory settlement in life he
  agreed that ned and margaret
  should be married very quietly early
  in the coming month and that after
  the wedding the young pair should
  make an extended trip through the
  southwest

   margarets days became an orgy
  of shopping expeditions her nights
  were occupied with dreams of the
  happy future she was going to spend
  with her lover the ominous and
  mysterious words of mrs campbell
  had apparently been erased from her
  mind not so with clare the lame
  girl remembered with terrible dis-
  tinctness the dilemma that her sister

had so tersely and indignantly
stated one of the two must pay for
the others life or happiness by sac-
rificing her own

  to do margaret full justice she
would not knowingly have accepted
happiness at the expense of her
younger sister but she had dismissed
the words of the seeress as fantastic
vaporings unworthy of consideration
clare however had been deeply im-
pressed she spent hours pondering
on them if her death would pur-
chase margarets happiness the lame
girl was ready to surrender it she
did not put into words her secret
thought that margarets happiness
was also the happiness of ned went-
worth

 time flew margarets wedding
was so near at hand that when clare
looked at the calendar on the wall
of their room she found but a single
day remaining before the older sister
would leave her home for the new
life that spread with so much rich
promise before her day by day
clare had prayed fervently for
strength to resist any fresh attacks
upon her psychic forces by the entity
which she knew as clifford bentley
once or twice clare now watchful
and alert had felt the certain indi-
cations of cliffords presence the
failing of her vital powers that pre-
ceded the entrance of the spirit-lover
so convincingly if invisibly into the
material world as yet she had been
able to fight him off and this gave
her confidence in her ability to save
her sister from the annoyance if
nothing more that cliffords influ-
ence might bring to bear upon either
margaret or ned

  the night before the wedding ned
did not drop in as he had expected
he telephoned to margaret that he
was not feeling quite himself but
would undoubtedly be all right in the
morning his words were mild in
comparison to what he was experi-
encing for several days he had


weird tales

been fighting off an obsession even
worse than the mild one that had
overcome him on the night of his en-
gagement to margaret he had not
dared be off his guard for a moment
as surely as he permitted his
thoughts to wander ever so slightly
he felt them getting beyond his con-
trol until his head would be awhirl
with incolierencies and strange con-
jectures that tormented him cruelly

  he began to remember inci-
dents that concerned margaret but
in which he figured as a principal
incidents in which he knew at the
same time that he had never taken
part one time he found himself
saying aloud with persistence i am
clifford bentley i am clifford
bentley until he caught himself
up with what was almost terror
clutching at his heart

  intuition told him that clifford
bentley must be the rival now mak-
ing such desperate efforts to cause
trouble between margaret and him-
self ned swore that he would not
give her up no matter what the cost
of keeping her might be as his de-
termination on this point increased
so did the insidious attacks upon his
mental stronghold by the invisible
rival

  the night before his wedding ned
had come to the point where he was
half dead for want of sleep his
apprehensions had grown so strong
that he had been keeping himself
awake night after night with strong
coffee fearing to relax his guard for
a single moment that night he
could hold out  longer he was
obliged to give way to sleep for a few
hours flesh and blood could stand
no more

  when he waked the next day he
found to his consternation that he
had overslept it was already noon
and as the wedding was set for 
oclock he had no more time than
was absolutely necessary to dress
and motor out to dr sloanes he

paid little or no attention to a dull
ache in his head and a tingling
pricking sensation that occasionally
shot through his body if he thought
of it at all it was as the natural re-
sult of his sleeplessness for several
nights and the consequent nervous
strain certain it is that he did not
think of it as having any connection
with clifford bentley

 the wedding was to be a very
quiet one the only outside person
present being father rooney mar-
garet was to be unattended had
she chosen a bridesmaid it would
have been clare but the lame girl
insisted that her crutches would have
made a distressingly inharmonious
appearance the bride came into the
room on her fathers arm the old doc-
tor having managed to brace up suffi-
ciently to go through the short cere-
mony of giving his daughter away

  near the officiating clergyman who
had been placed near the window
opening on the garden stood the
bridegroom ned also was unat-
tended  he had decided that he was
fully able to take care of margarets
wedding ring without any outside as-
sistance as his bride approached
the young man turned his head to-
ward her a sudden horror and dis-
may seized upon him as he looked
he became aware that strangely
enough his emotions were so complex
as to convince him without a strug-
gle that he was at once himself and
that other in vain he fought against
that terrible obsession he could do
nothin to drive out the triumphant
rival who had entered his mind his
body in despair he cast down his
eyes dreading lest others might read
in them the strange and awful thing
that had befallen him

 margaret approached her head
bent her eyes on the flowers she car-
ried the clergyman began to read
from his prayer-book ned could feel
the gentle presence of the girl he
loved as she paused beside him when
a suitor from the shades



the clergyman addressed the question
to ned that would bind him to her
it seemed to him that the intruding
personality was laughing at him as it
whipped the replies out of his very
mouth responding with a decisive ab-
ruptness that caused the minister to
send a quick glance at the brusk
bridegroom ned was praying for
the ceremony to close

  the minister addressed the bride
wilt thou take this man to be thy
wedded husband    

  wentworths heart pumped madly
in a moment it would be over a si-
lence succeeded to the clergymans
question a silence that endured-that
weighed down every heart ned
lifted his head and sought margarets
eyes in astonishment

  she was looking at him horror on
her amazed face the flowers she
was carrying fell tumbling at her feet
from relaxed fingers she took an in-
stinctive step backward and put one
hand behind her gropingly as though
seeking support still she stared at
him incredulously the clergyman
not understanding prompted her in
an undertone with a sharp anguish
that cut the young lovers heart her
voice rang out wildly

 no-no-no she screamed and
sank back unconscious into the arms
of her father



consternation on every face clare
had dropped hers into both
hands and was sobbing and praying
behind that frail shield dr sloane
stood holding his fainting daughter
as if he had been turned into stone
and unable to move the clergyman
had closed his prayer-book and gazed
in bewilderment at the fainting bride
and the agonized astounded groom

  only father rooney grasped the
situation even faintly he it was who
relieved the old doctor of his burden
and carried margaret to the divan
it was he who motioned everyone but

the young lover from the room he
held salts to the girls nostrils while
lie questioned ned with a single look
of sympathetic inquiry

  i dont know thats the worst
of it i dont know ned groaned
miserably father i havent been
quite myself since the night we be-
came engaged do you suppose-she
could have-felt the difference i
can imagine nothing else that would
have turned her against me so sud-
denly and incomprehensibly

  do you mean my poor boy that
you have felt that invisible presence
again that-that it has become an
obsession

  exactly i have fought it for
days but last night-i had lost so
much sleep apologetically i could
not keep awake that was its chance
i suppose this morning i have been
feeling strange when i come to think
of it hurriedly ned recounted his
experiences with the invisible rival
who had taken possession of his very
self that afternoon replying to the
ministers questions through the lips
of the obsessed

  the old priest nodded his head
wisely i think i understand my
son it is a strange condition and a
difficult one i hardly know what to
advise you

  ned stood looking down at the un-
conscious girl his eyes melancholy
i can only fight until i can go on
with it no longer he said despair-
ingly but how am i to continue
fighting with an invisible entity that
takes advantage of me in my un-
guarded moments of sleep   

  do you feel the presence at this
moment demanded father rooney

  n-no i think not that is cor-
recting himself i feel that it is
somewhere near but not controlling
me for the time being  

  father rooney hastily crossed him-
self for the time being ned
there is nothing for you to do but to
keep away from margaret whatever


weird tales

this unknown entity is its interest
seems to be in keeping you two apart
until you feel yourself complete mas-
ter of the situation it will be best for
you to leave margaret alone

  i feel that strongly but-it will
be very hard father

  would you bring worse upon the
woman you love said the priest
gravely believe me my son this
matter will have to be solved by other
power than yours or mine i am per-
suaded however that your wisest
course now will be to leave margaret  

  the young man bent pressed a ten-
der kiss upon the forehead of the girl
who was to have been his wife and
went sadly from the room dr sloane
and clare were waiting for him in the
hall their anxious eyes questioned
him

  the marriage must be postponed
and father rooney feels that it will
be wiser for me not to be here when
margaret comes out of her faint i 
telephone later to learn how our dear
girl is getting along 

  dr sloane patted his shoulder
cheer up ned i think its nothing
more than the result of nervous strain
wedding preparations have been too
much for margie but i certainly
never would have thought shed keel
over like that shes so athletic and in
such fine condition well shell be
all right in a couple of days and then
well have you two tied up in a jiffy
and off on your honeymoon  

  clare who knew only too well what
must be the root of the trouble al-
though she could not know the exact
circumstances dared not meet neds
eyes so disturbed was she i shall
be praying for you ned she whis-
pered timidly as she slipped away to
assist the good priest in his ministra-
tions

  margaret revived presently and sat
up controlling herself with a strong
effort i want to be alone please
she said clare i dont mind you
of course her eyes dropped down

upon her traveling gown i must
take off these things she said sadly

  as she rose to leave the room her
self-control gave way tears gushed
from her eyes blinding her until she
had to lean against the lame girl for
guidance

  oh it is cruel she sobbed
what have we done to deserve this
persecution tell ned dad that it
isnt his fault but i cant explain
just now i hope-i hope he will for-
give me

nphe girls went to their room their
    tears mingling

  the day wore away ned tele-
phoned in and received margarets
message to which she had added that
it was her conviction their marriage
could never take place but that she
would always love him-a message
that half maddened the unhappy
young man

  the sisters retired early although
there was no sleep for either of them
for hours clare won her sisters con-
fidence at last margaret confided to
her the reason for the no that
should have been yes neds ob-
session by the determined spirit of
clifford bentley had been so plainly
discernible by the girl that she had
refused to marry him because she felt
it would not have been ned she was
marrying but the intruding person-
ality of that long-dead childhood
sweetheart the horror of the situa-
tion had been too much for her self-
control the bizarre idea of becom-
ing the wife of two men in one body
had forced from her that decisive
agonized negative

  clare calmed her as best she might
both girls prayed together and about
half past  they fell asleep ex-
hausted by their emotions

  it was as the girls ascertained
afterward shortly after midnight
that margaret awoke from troubled
dreams the room was in partial
darkness as she shook off her drow-
a suitor from the shades



siness slfe became aware of arms
about lier and a face that pressed
close against her own the thought
flashed through her gratefully that
her sister had been watching and
praying over her she turned her lips
to meet those others that sought hers

  the kiss undeceived her that was
no sisters kiss

  with convulsive nervous force mar-
garet drew herself away from the
arms that had been holding her and
sat up in bed half dazed for an in-
stant she imagined that the events of
the afternoon had been a dream and
that it was the kiss of her young hus-
band that had just been pressed upon
her lips and then she knew that it
was no dream

  the soft light of the night lamp
fell upon the face of a young man a
complete stranger who in his turn
rose from the kneeling posture he had
been maintaining by the side of her
bed although she had never seen
that face as an adult faee the terri-
fied girl knew intuitively that she was
looking upon the features of clifford
bentley who had succeeded at last in
making himself visible and tangible

  she felt her senses slipping weakly
from her control she was convinced
that this would be fatal as she had
not the slightest confidence in the
kindly intentions of that dread lover
from the unknown world with all
her might she gripped at courage and
stared that dead-alive entity squarely
in the deep eyes that burned passion-
ately upon her with a significance
that froze the coursing blood in her
veins margaret sloane was no cow-
ard but she had never shaken and
trembled as she did that night in the
throes of an unearthly fear

  what do you want she man-
aged to whisper through dry lips

 you

  why do you come back to torment
me that was a childs silly promise
-you can not hold me to it  

  i can-and ivill the appari-

tion doubly terrible because of its
tangibility moved toward her

    no-no  she thrust out protest-
ing hands wildly dont come
nearer if you do i shall scrcam
i can not bear it 

  clifford bentley leaned toward her
smiling with white teeth showing be-
tween red lips and regarding the
shrinking horrified girl meaningly
you fear me-yet you have tasted
my warm kisses he whispered do
you think my rival will want you
now silly margie

  margarets brain began to whirl
surmises too dreadful to shape into
words prodded her mind sharply
she threw herself desperately from
the bed anywhere away from that
triumphantly smiling face and began
to scream

  shriek after shriek rang through
the startled house

  the figure of clifford bentley re-
tired around the foot of margarets
bed and approached that of clare
before the older sisters staring in-
credulous eyes he leaned over the
sleeping girl-and the next instant he
had disappeared like a dissipating
vapor from her sight



the screams of his older daughter
brought the doctor stumbling
from his room across the hall he
entered abruptly to find margaret on
the floor in a dead faint and clare
sitting up in bed rubbing her eyes
apparently half dazed inquiry
failed to elicit anything further than
that margaret had had a nightmare
which had so terrified her that she
had sprung from bed to fall uncon-
scious on the floor

  after she had been revived and
tucked into bed again and her father
had left the girls alone clare made
her sister tell the whole unbelievable
story while both glanced fearfully
over their shoulders into the dim
shadows of the room as margaret


weird tales

finished her voice broken with sobs
her eyes wide with her unspoken
fears the lame girl exclaimed with
indignation he is cruel margie
and a coward to behave like this

    i cant help being terribly afraid
who can tell how far his power will
carry him confessed the half-hys-
terical margaret

  clare was silent she too was
afraid more she was remembering
with poignant emotion the last words
the seeress had spoken to her the
lame girl pressed both hands tightly
against her laboring heart that beat
so painfully in her bosom gladly
she would have stilled its beating
could she have known surely that the
act would purchase immunity for
margaret and happiness for ned

  margie the first thing we must do
in the morning is to see mrs camp-
bell   she said at last   she can help
us if anyone can dont try to dis-
suade me dear you must admit that
even a forlorn hope is worth snatch-
ing at now  

  margaret had so far lost her former
high spirits and self-confidence that
she would have assented willingly to
whatever plans clare might have pro-
posed still she could not help ques-
tioning mrs campbells ability to
find a way out of the terrible and tor-
tuous maze in which she and ned
seemed lost

  do you really believe there is any-
thing extraordinary about laura
campbells trances clare she
asked earnestly ive always won-
dered at the loss of dignity such
feigning costs her  

  she really has what they call sec-
ond-sight margie ive seen her my-
self in trances not often because
mr campbell hates to have her give
way to them but the day we were
in the garden and i had that heart
attack-you remember-she spoke
with the voice of a man and-i knew
somehow that it was lie her own

tones were modified as she-spoke and
she glanced timorously about her

  well conceded margaret unhap-
pily i suppose we ought to do
everything we can-and if she is able
to help us i know mr campbell will
let her but i cant help being skep-
tical  it all seems so foolish and child-
ish to me of course if you want me
to ill run over and ask her if she
can help us out

  oh margie if you only would
urged clare earnestly

  margaret accordingly went across
the road to their scotch neighbors
home and related to laura campbell
the story of the nightmare she had
had the previous night the quiet-
faced woman listened in grim silence
a non-committal expression on her
round motherly countenance only
the continuous snapping of the catch
of the chatelaine betrayed her nerv-
ousness

  youll have to make up a circle
and hold a seance and call him
she said with finality

  i dont see why shrank the girl

  you dont see why you fool-
ish girl you make me lose all patience
with you 

 but-

   but nothing snapped the
scotchwoman with asperity you
are an ungrateful girl margaret
sloane and a blindly selfish one
too if you want my frank opinion
your sister clare is being slowly
killed all her vital forces are being
drawn out of her by that - that male
vampire - that satellite of your at-
tractions and you - you draw back
at the only chance to make terms with
him im sure i dont know what
you can be thinking of

  margarets color was running high
i had no idea that my sister was in
danger of any kind she retorted
spiritedly but the mere suggestion
of such a thing is sufficient to make
me agree to any plan no matter how
idiotic it may appear will you un-
a suitor from the shades



dertake to conduct a seance for us
abruptly

  have someone telephone your fi-
ance to be at your home this evening
at  oclock see that arrangements
are made so that we can have the en-
tire evening undisturbed by visitors
i will be over as soon as mr camp-
bell has gone to his lodge its for-
tunate tonight is lodge night or youd
have to wait my husband would not
give me his permission to act as med-
ium at your seance so ive got to do
it behind his back and i can as-
sure you margaret sloane that isnt
a pleasant thing for me to do

  margaret confronted with the pos-
sibility that her neighbor might re-
pent her offer was transformed from
scorner to suppliant her eyes plead-
ed eloquently

  g-et along with you margaret
snorted the scotchwoman with
feigned indignation asking me to
deceive my good douglas are you
there there dont worry my dear
laura campbell has never yet turned
her back on anyone who really needed
her help ill be over at  oclock

  margaret did not feel up to talking
directly with ned and begged clare
to telephone for her ned was in his
rooms happily and almost out of his
head with joy at hearing that a pos-
sible solution of the weird problem
might be reached so soon he prom-
ised to be at dr sloanes at the ap-
pointed hour

lare was sitting on the porch that
evening at about half past  when
she saw the bowed figure of father
rooney approaching through the
dusk he came up slowly and seated
himself on the top step fanning him-
self with his broad-brimmed hat for
the day had been a hot one

  i dont know that youll want to
stay this evening father the lame
girl said to him timidly father
wont be free to play chess with you
tonight you see were going to do

something of which you wont ap-
prove - we re going to hold a seance
to see if we cant learn how to get
out of the strange situation in which
we seem to have been thrown  

  father rooney stopped fanning
himself his hat half hid his face
from the girl as he looked sharply
at her over its wide brim there was
an anxious note in his voice

  a seance my daughter is your
father permitting it does he con-
sider it a wise thing for - well
clare for you my child im speak-
ing not only as a priest but from the
physicians standpoint

  clare returned his grave query
with a serene smile oh i dont
believe it can do me any harm she
said thoughtfully do you suppose
anything could hurt me more than
to believe that some malicious spirit
is robbing me daily of strength in
order to torment my poor sister  be-
sides id rather risk a-a heart at-
tack father than continue to go
through what ive been suffering for
weeks

  father rooney sighed too well he
knew the self-sacrifice that was the
dominant note in clares nature

  i can not attend such a meeting
my child as you know but - i
think i shall remain i can pray for
you and yours - it may well be that
god sent me here for just that to-
night - when you may need spirit-
ual help more than ever in your lives
before 

  he rose to greet the doctor and
ned who had been walking in the
grounds

  ned had not entered the house as
yet fearing a repetition of the ter-
rible scene that had taken place on
the ill-fated day of the wedding for
although he had been feeling himself
almost entirely free from his obses-
sion since he had kept away from
margaret how could he know when
it might return in force

  coming in he asked the priest


weird tales

  i will sit out here observed
father rooney here i can watch
the stars

  mrs campbell came up the bricked
path at this juncture and the whole
party with the exception of the good
priest went indoors

  margaret was sitting on the divan
in the front room as ned entered
she rose to her feet and put out both
hands while tears sprang to her eyes
and rolled piteously down her cheeks

  my poor ned can you ever for-
give me she murmured brokenly

  there is nothing to forgive he
whispered oh margie let us hope
that tonight may open a way for us
out of the tangle that seems to have
been made of our happiness

  mrs campbell interposed with her
usual bruskness

  better for you to keep your ex-
changes of affection for a later mo-
ment she said decidedly i sym-
pathize with you but every moment
you are enraging yet more the entity
who has proved powerful enough to
have made a fine tangle of your
affairs dr sloane will you and mr
wentworth arrange the chairs so that
we can sit in a circle

  she busied herself with the pre-
liminary arrangements for the seance
her every movement followed closely
by the lame girl

  clare sat apart from the rest hands
folded tightly in her lap eyes dark
with melancholy when everything
had been arranged to her satisfaction
the scotchwoman indicated to each
their places in the circle she seated
ned at her left clare at her right
dr sloane sat on the other side of
the lame girl and margaret-half
glad half afraid - between lover
and father

  the lights were turned out only
a small night lamp its tiny wick
floating on the oil stood upon the
table at the other end of the room
in that flickering and barely discern-
ible light the faces of the sitters

flashed into and out of sight at every
draft of air that floated in at the
garden window

  the seeress tense and watchful
maintained her hold on clares hand
with gentle force she felt the lame
girl sink back in her chair limply
with a kind of half-sob half-sigh
the doctor spoke in hushed tones

   im afraid clare is fainting he
worried

   i guarantee that she is all right
for the time being replied the psy-
chic quickly she has slipped off
into a trance do not try to waken
her  it is better so i shall direct
instead of becoming the medium my-
self for clare is to be our medium
tonight now we shall be able to
see and talk with mr clifford bent-
ley

   hardly had the words left her lips
before margaret holding tightly to
the hands of father and lover gave
a sharp exclamation

  standing directly behind clares
chair was the figure of clifford bent-
ley his white face and burning eyes
fixed upon the unhappy bride with
passionate intensity



ned spoke impulsively half rising
as he cried out you miserable
scoundrel   his eyes flashed an-
grily

  mrs campbell maintained her grip
on his hand and drew him down
firmly sit down mr wentworth
this is no time to call names she
addressed the newcomer with cold
courtesy i see that you have an-
ticipated our wishes we are here
tonight especially to talk with you
 i know - i know muttered the
newcomer fiexcely i understood
that you intended to meddle and i
came before i was called of my own
accord otherwise you would have
had the mortification of not seeing

tering over several tables in his bam
of a laboratory fussing with number-
less bottles and flasks filled with mi-
crobes of every description flitting
back and forth between two precious
powerful microscopes - the most
powerful obtainable his mother a
full head taller than he shifted si-
lently like a gaunt shadow from room
to room of the adjoining living
building sometimes drifting into the
laboratory respectfully watching her
strange changeling with wondering

eyes waiting for the star in his fore-
head to take shape and shine saul
worshiped her in silence

  he gave little thought to any other
human being for a time then he
began to think intensely of all human
beings the star began to take shape
in the beginning his interest in mi-
crobes had been born of incited and
urged by a curiosity that craved
cognizance of all minute forms of
life but along with the fascinating
studies of chemistry and bacteriology
he had learned the names of pasteur
koch and all that royal vanguard of
adventurers he had seen the record
of service accomplished for mankind
service rendered by men who fought
hideous forms of disease to free the
world from horrible menace and
into the very huge heart that pumped
and thumped in saul blauvettes
very small body there was bom a
mighty longing to go onward in the
footsteps of those other valiant men
of science to follow in the wake of
those who had achieved triumph in
battle with horror and death his
mother looking into the enormous
slate-gray eyes saw the swift rising
glow of that inner genius-torch and
knew that the star in his forehead
had begun to shine

 among the few who had not
shunned him who had looked through
the all but repellent crust surround-
ing him and seen the potentialities of
the man inside was old doc whittly
their family physician for twenty
years in whittlys unchanging at-
titude of cordial friendliness in his
atmosphere of unspoken understand-
ing saul sensed the existence of an
ally waiting only the moment of
emergency and need to reveal itself
when the star began to shine and
saul found himself at the crossways
his feet stayed for lack of definitive
knowledge concerning the horrors
that rode the world he went to old
doc whittly
the dark chrysalis



it was an epochal conversation
that ensued it was the beginning
of a magnificent dream a ghastly
pursuit leading down a gruesome
trail it was born in words couched
in sauls comical polyglot of ideal-
istic english modern slang and pep-
pery curse-words and in the doctors
slow dignified technism

  im going after microbes in ear-
nest doc saul announced bustling
into whittlys office and sitting down
gingerly on the edge of a chair with
the aiv of a man holding himself in
readiness to spring to his feet fearful
that the chair underneath him might
suddenly give way he peered at
the doctor with his huge and solemn
eyes as he began firing a series of
questions what disease most men-
aces the world today what disease
entails more pain horror and fear
than any other what disease could
i attack and conquer by which i
would render the greatest service to
society at large what disease causes
more hell than all the rest put to-
gether

  cancer whittlys answer was
instantaneous he held his silence
for a moment studying saul intent-
ly as might a man facing something
he has long expected yet taken un-
awares remembering the length of
the young scientists lonely queerly-
assorted life he recalled the things
he secretly had predicted saul might
some day accomplish as he added
slowly in my opinion cancer is the
biggest menace that exists today for
a number of reasons but it isnt
caused by microbes of any sort-so
that lets you out

  so saul moved restlessly on
the edge of his chair what does
cause it then

  nobody knows whittly shook
his head men have been speculat-
ing on that question for two thou-
sand years and have been actively
trying to determine the answer for
over a hundred years

  well if you dont know what
causes it how do you know it isnt
microbes saul demanded

  it just isnt whittly smiled
slightly at sauls retort there are
no microbes about it better men
than you and i have determined that
sciu  

  i dont believe it saul slid
back an inch on his chair and ruffled
his lank dun-colored hair with nerv-
ous fingers i believe all disease is
caused by microbes without excep-
tion but ive never studied diseases
much all ive studied is bugs and
i got to reading about those marvel-
ous fellows who went gunning for
disease just because they got started
fiddling with bugs-like me they
were genius-men doc

  they were whittly agreed
they certainly were the saga of
the microbe-runters is a great saga  

  you bet your sweet life saul
moved out perilously near the edge
of his chair aflame with enthusiasm
his bursting energy evidencing itself
in drumming fingers that could not
lie still he broke into a torrent of
excited eulogistic speech that
brought a look half of amusement
half of astonishment to whittlys
face its like a fairy-tale it
started away back in the seventeenth
century when crazy old antony
leeuwenhoek was born in delft hol-
land he was the first of them he
took the first step on the glory trail
for the saving of mankind-by bugs
he made the first complicated lenses
and microscopes how he loved em
but pasteur was the real explorer
the real vanguard though others
went betoie him

  yes youre right he was
whittly nodded his eyes deep and
brooding

  youre damn tootin im right
saul bounced to his feet and began
pacing back and forth in front of the
doctor look at what he started
look at the men who trailed after

  yes whittly agreed softly
yesl

   people havent an even break
doc saul paused in front of the
elder man and leaned toward him
with fanatical eyes   the water they
drink the food they eat even the air
they breathe is full of invisible mi-
crobes swimming and wriggling and
floating around just waiting to get
into somebody and kill him off i-
listen i read about that woman
who brought her boy to pasteur-the
first human being into whom pasteur
ever injected his serum you know
and the boy was bitten in fourteen
places by a mad dog and the other
doctors said he had to die horribly
bxt pasteur was brave enough to
take the chance he shot his hydro-
phobia serum into him-and the kid
wasnt even sick i read that i tell
you and i-cried dont you dare
laugh  

  im not whittly denied look-
ing away so-so did i

  well dont you see saul
threw himself into the chair he had
vacated drawing it elose facing
whittly ive got to do something
for people what good does it ac-
complish for me to go studying all
about microbes and experimenting
with them unless i do something for
people unless i give them eseape

  escape whittly frowned puz-
zled

  exactly to me doe the only
men who were ever great were those
men who gave the people of the
world just one thing-escape i
dont care how the world labels him
no man was ever great to me unless
he gave the people escape and the
quality of his greatness is measured
by the quantity of his contribution
think it over

  escape whittly repeated star-
ing into the enormous slate-gray eyes
held by their flaring light youve
got some funny ideas saul

  i dont give a rap how funny
they are so long as they are ideas-
and have an l tacked onto the end
of them saul jumped to his feet
and began pacing again waving his
arms and talking so swiftly that his
words tumbled over his tongue in
their eagerness to get themselves said
every man or woman who ever
gave the world the least avenue of
escape had his or her share of great-
ness why look even henry ford
-he gave the people a cheap ear and
thereby many a day of beauty and
rest and change theyd never have
had but for him he gave them es-
cape from the bondage of monotony
and that makes him great  

  henry ford whittly ejacu-
lated saul you are crazy
thanks id hate to be sane
saul made a sweeping gesture if
im crazy im in magnificent com-
pany  im with the fellows who gave
the world escape take the great
and sift them down shakespeare and
masefield give the people escape from
ugliness fritz kreisler and beetho-
ven give them escape from the ter-
rible silence of their own thoughts
such as anatole france give them
eseape from pettiness christ gives
them escape from dread of that
futile impotent thing-six feet of
dirt and the last handful of dust
have you noticed that big corot in
the dark chrysalis



my dirty laboratory he gives men
escape from environment every day
i walk the bank of that peace-swept
river yet these eyes shall never see
any such river-only the one corot
gave me and pasteur-pasteur
gives them escape from fear whats
finer than to give them escape from
fear

  nothing whittly answered
slowly staring into sauls face
nothing i really suspect that giv-
ing them escape from anything is
rather beautiful

  sauls great eyes blazed you
give a human being escape from the
fears that hem him in he said
and hell go a mighty long way
he wheeled and strode across the
room standing over the old doctor
all i know is bugs what i do ive
got to do with bugs and some of
them are so unbelievably microscopic
that you can hardly find them with
the most powerful lens i want to do
what pasteur did i want to fight
bugs with bugs and give my people
escape from fear

  your people whittly started
your people

  aye my people suddenly saul
straightened and stood very still his
flaming eyes were black with the
brooding stare of a man who stares
into eternity his voice dropped from
its high cry caught and hung on a
somber throbbing note like a fathom-
less pidse of melody my people
what did kipling say the people
lord thy people are good enough
for me thats me my people all
the people i make no discrimina-
tions the brave the bad the bril-
liant the brainless just people just
humans humans hurting and want-
ing and striving and fearing my
people doc-tell me this saul
again threw himself into the chair
facing whittly his eyes smoldering
and his voice rose in eager demand
are people afraid of cancer
are they afraid of it lord

man id say you didnt know much
about disease whittly roused
alive with his own long interest in
that subject look here saul ill
show you just how afraid they are
there are certain definite conditions
known to precede cancer its always
possible to apprehend it and taken in
its early stages nine times out of ten
its curable but people are appal-
lingly ignorant about it they are too
frightened over it to investigate to
ascertain its action and learn to
watch for the danger signals they
think cancer is equivalent to a death
sentence they wont even go to a
doctor at the appearance of the first
signs-theyre afraid hell say its
cancer and they shiver in fear and
hug their horror to their hearts till
its too late-and they die and the
world continues to consider it a death
sentence and the fear grows if we
could only educate them to under-
stand-to be wise and understand

and take it in time-

  you never can saul cut in curt-
ly   there will always be a majority
of minds too lacking in the fine points
of intelligence to realize the value of
early diagnosis there will always
be thousands and tens of thousands
you cant possibly educate to that
standard but those thousands can
get cancer and shiver in fear and

suffer and die and-

  thats just the trouble whitt-
ly interrupted excitedly theyre
crazed with fear over it bound up

in fear-

  the dark chrysalis saul cried
his slate-gray eyes black with sudden
emotion the dark chrysalis ive
found it

  what are you talking about
whittly asked sharply

  fear saul leaned forward and
looked somberly into the doctors
face fear is the dark chrysalis i
wanted to find some disease that so
wrapped the human race in fear that


weird tales

they were like a pupa in a eocoon-
helpless in their dark chrysalis
well youve found it all right
whittly admitted grimly he stared
at saul with new eyes was the sap-
ling man mad or genius if the
human race was ever helplessly
bound up in anything it is helpless-
ly bound up in its fear of cancer
and the only way it will ever come
out of that fear is by a widespread
campaign of instruction concerning

the early stages-

  youre wrong saul interrupt-
ed what about the tens of thou-
sands no cancer itself has got
to be conquered and the medical
profession will never do it alone
some guy like me will meddle along
like pasteur with his mad dogs and
stumble onto it as he stumbled onto
the cure for hydrophobia and im
going to be that man ive found
my quest there isnt anything in
this world wreaks so enormous a
havoc as fear the dark chrysalis
and im going to break it open im
going to bring it out into the light

whittly stared mad genius
by the grace of god both saul
sat back in his chair abruptly cool
calculating the man of science prob-
ing into dark places the flaming
light in his eyes and on his face sank
to a cold steady glow-the glow of
the star in his forehead which had
begun to shine unwaveringly and
should never cease he began ask-
ing preconsidered well-weighed ques-
tions listening intently to the old
doctors concise comprehensive an-
swers he began with this how
many kinds of cancer are there
not many whittly breathed a
sigh of relief this cool atmosphere
of technical investigation suited him
better he had been bewildered
shaken by sauls tense wildness
now he gave his whole attention to
the business of answering the seeker
after knowledge as lucidly and terse-

ly as possible there are the scir-
rhus or hard cancer the encephaloid
or soft cancer and the epithelial
the scirrhus has much fiber and not
so many cells grows slowly spreads
and ulcerates appears most often
in breasts or internal organs the
encephaloid is just the opposite in
structure has many cells and less
fiber the things look like brains
thats what encephaloid means any-
way thats the kind called acute
cancer grows with astounding rapid-
ity attacks most frequently internal
organs and limbs the epithelial is
full of cells like the cells in your
skin comes on the skin and mucous
membranes-like your lip what
else can i tell you

  does it get one sex more than
the other what ages suffer from it
most   

    it kills far more women than
men whittly replied stifling a
sigh men know it most in internal
organs-stomach liver intestines-
after that lip and tongue women it
most often attacks in the breast and
in less degree in the same organs in
which it attacks men its the dis-
ease of age people from  to 
are ten times more susceptible than
those from  to 

  thats the worst thing youve
said yet saul cut in women
have enough to suffer trite-but
true and taking people off just
when theyve begun to learn how to
live another angle there to help
the old live on but give me some-
thing more definitive doe dont you
know anything about it  how it
works for instance

  oh we know how it works right
enough whittly nodded grimly
  its some kind of tumorous growth
a lot of little cells massed together in
a kind of milky juice we call cancer
juice its all chugged up together
in a pretty dense fibrous framework
doesnt have any well-defined limits
just starts and grows and eats up all
the dark chrysalis



the textures in its vicinity spreads
by the lymphatics and the veins and
the cells that multiply so o-b-normally
are apparently normal cells thats
the baffling thing

  well what are those cells what
makes them act that way

  yes you tell us whittlys
laugh was good-naturedly ironic
thats what youre going to find
out i believe nobody knows man
but havent they worked out
any theories sauls cool analjsti-
cal mind probed on ignoring the
doctors jeer

  theories whittly snorted

	 theories hypotheses suppositions
and deductions thats all they have
accomplished theyve exhausted
every idea you could possibly ad-
vance-and theyve got nowhere it
isnt hereditary it isnt contagious
neither believed so nor proven so it
isnt a blood disease thats the
damnable thing about it they dont
know what it is they only know
that something malignant corroding
putrefying gets into that bunch of
cells and eats eats eats into the liv-
ing flesh saul did you ever see any-
one with cancer it was whittly
who was getting excited now he sat
erect his eyes alive with the hideous
thing he was visioning

  no saul shook his head lean-
ing toward the old doctor electrified
by a thrill of repulsion at something
in whittlys tone i never did it
must be ghastly

    ghastly its horrible think
of it man a creeping menace we
cant define of which we cant de-
termine the origin fastening itself
on a human body in human vital or-
gans eating into the living flesh
making of a living breathing body a
loathsome stinking putrefying abom-
ination and we cant stop it
everything weve ever tried is help-
less before its insidious crawling
erosion x-ray and radium have been
known to benefit and even cure iso-

lated cases yet the x-ray failed
acted crazily benefited some cases
aggravated others too experimental
and risky at best radium isnt
proved of any particular use yet
little to work with in the first place
too few know how to use it skilfully
its value is yet undetermined may
never prove a real cure-only useful
in treatment there isnt any medi-
eine that will cure it thats sure
oh theyve got up a lot of fake cures
pastes poultices drugs-and they
manufacture testimonials for them
by the carload lots but theyre all
bunk saul all we can do is cut it
out-cut out the loathsome eating
thing but weve got to get it in
time or even thats futile it comes
back and starts eating somewhere
else

 my god what a gruesome pic-
ture you paint saul said sharply

  i dont paint it half as horrible
as it is whittly shuddered involun-
tarily good god man if youd
seen them as ive seen them theres
your poor humans hurting-and
wanting-and striving-and fearing
crazed with fear begging you with
insane eyes and breaking voices to
save them when youd give your
right arm to and cant and the dis-
ease grows appallingly the latest
statistics show an increase of about
y per cent more cases a year two
and a half more per cent of people
every year attacked by that malig-
nant creeping death-stunned with
fear dying-no cure-

  theyll never find the cure till
they find the cause   saul interrupt-
ed the light of the flaming star again
blazing in his enormous eyes
theres a microbe i tell you

 maybe whittly conceded
doubtfully god knows no germ
capable of causing cancer has ever
been demonstrated if youre right
and there is one that makes the pic-
ture all the more ghastly to think
that there may be some minute grisly


weird tales

bug in your flesh and we cant find
it-and it eats away the living tissue
eats till-

a choking gasp halted whittlys
almost frenzied speech and both
men turned quickly to see the doc-
tors office girl standing just inside
the door carrying to the cabinet by
the wall some cleanly boiled instru-
ments both saul and whittly had
been so engrossed that they had
failed to hear the door open the
girl had stood there in frozen silence
listening to whittlys rising voice
till the horror of what he was saying
wrung from her lips the gasp that
had interrupted the doctors speech

  whittly caught himself into calm-
ness and control as the girl stam-
mered an apology i-i beg your
pardon i just stepped into the room
to return these-

  no apology necessary helene
mr blauvette and i just got talking
pretty heatedly about my pet horror
this is saul blauvette-ive told you
a lot about him miss kinkaid saul
shes a new addition to my office
just took her in last month ive
been telling you saul would do some-
thing great with his bugs some day
helene he-well hes going to
tackle cancer

  youre right i am saul turned
his enormous eyes upon the girl who
stood still in the doorway watching
his face she nodded an acknowl-
edgment of the introduction but
saul ignored it blazing again with
excitement he sprang to his feet
ran his hand backward over his lank
hair and took a step toward the girl
im going to find the microbe im
going to solve the mystery of those
wildly erratic cells

 if you could solve that
helenes face paled her eyes lit with
the potential might of such a discov-
ery it flashed on saul that there
was no doubt of him in her exclama-
tion it was as though she had said

for the saving of the world-a
master has come and that strange
man looked into her wide brown eyes
and gave her his heart his immeas-
urable capacity for glory and his
vehement allegiance she believed
she looked back into his enormous
eyes and spoke again under her
breath oh-if you could do that
think what it would mean to the
world  

  im going to do it sauls great
eyes glowed as phosphorus glows in a
pitch-black night he leaned toward
the girl and whittly looked on dum-
iounded at the thing that flashed be-
tween the little scientist and helene
kinkaid youve shown me the
way you believe in me dont you
all ive got to do is believe in my-
self

  and god helene whispered
man does all things-through
god

  i dont know much about god
sauls speech slowed i believe-
but i guess ive just gotten away
from him ive given my life to
bugs ive given my life to some-
thing else lately to people-all my
people and now ive given my life
to a third thing to you all that i
am or have or ever hope to be-
something to bring and lay in the
palm of your hand and say-this
is for you i did this for you
youve shown me the way you be-
lieved i shall give my people es-
cape from fear of death and pain-
and cancer ill find that microbe
and perfect some way of killing it

  youve certainly picked yourself
a job saul whittlys voice cut in
striving to level the swirling atmos-
phere that caught him by the throat
striving to bring coolness by half-
jesting words to a sudden vibration
of burning thought that shook the
room and him

  thats what i want saul re-
torted vehemently wheeling to face
the dark chrysalis



the  doctor raising clenched fists
above his head whittly shook dazed
anew at the flame in the young scien-
tists face and saul blazed on i
know what you think doc you
think im on the trail of an unattain-
able ideal youre wrong there
isnt anything unattainable in the
end its the pursuit of the unat-
tainable ideal that leads us to the
heights before-i might have failed
i might have lacked the last pound
of incentive to drive me on i cant
fail now he stopped short liter-
ally leaped across the room and
snatched the girls hands instru-
ments and all leaning forward to
gaze into her eyes on a level with his
own ive got her see helene
for you i would go to the sun for
you ill find and conquer that mi-
crobe there will be no more deaths
by cancer the world will shed its
fear of a vanquished menace i
shall break open the dark chrysalis
and lead them into the light for
you god-god must be coming
close to me again he sent you to
god-my gratitude i love you

  he bent over her hands held them
close together against his forehead
then in one swift movement he moved
them to crush them against his lips
dropped them wheeled caught up
his hat and darted out the door

  the girl stood like one stricken
staring after him dumb whittly
stared too moveless in his chair till
he found his tongue and blurted out
baldly crazy-crazy as a loon bat-
ty-mad as a march hare

  hes not helenes voice rose
in an exultant cry of defense hes
magnificent my god what a
dream  

  whittly sat motionless his gaze on
helene kinkaid and something quiv-
ered in the air about her like a living
energy the old doctor repeated
after her shaken dazed yes-my
god-what a dream

saul rushed home and whirled into
the house adjoining the labora-
tory his gaunt and silent mother
rose to her feet and peered down into
his face as he halted before her she
listened in silence as he poured out a
torrent of flaming incoherent words

  mother i know what im going
to do im going to conquer can-
cer cancer the word shot
through her like a flame leaving her
cold and rigid staring transfixed into
his enormous eyes as he raced on
whittly-whittly told me god-
what a hideous picture he drew-
something eating eating eating into
the living flesh he said that he
made me see it he made me see the
whole world-flaccid in fear of a
creeping crawling menace no one can
discover nor stay i m going to stop
it im going to find the microbe
that causes it im going to save the
world  

  his mother made no move spoke
no word she was stricken dumb
with the abrupt raising of her own
secret horror and a wild surging
hope for all his incoherency there
was about him a new one-pointed
driving purpose a crystallization of
effort into a given channel she knew
that the star in his forehead was
shining clear she saw too she saw
the long black trail upon which his
feet were unalterably set a trail
bloody and strewn with horrors
winding through welters of stench
and putrefying flesh-but she did
not flinch she was made of stern
stuff

  and-there was a girl sauls
voice dropped to an awed somber
throb there is a girl shes work
ing in whittlys office thats im-
material shes mine she came to
help me on-to guide my feet to
flagellate my heart when my will
grows weary it will grow weary i
know that it will be a long and bit-
ter fight but ill have helene-ill
haveyou it may take me all my


weird tales

life but i cant fail theres-
helene  

  he whirled and went racing into
the laboratory and his mother stood
dumbly gazing after him for a
long while she stood utterly still her
eyes on the doorway where he had
disappeared a girl saul-and a
girl she hadnt thought there would
ever be girls in sauls life girls-
no one a girl saul-the kind to
give to one all he had helene there
wouldnt be any other her thought
swerved from this helene to her son
and the thing he had sworn to do

  slowly she turned and went to
stand before a mirror and stare into
her own face two in her family
had died of cancer of the liver for
which there is no aid and no salva-
tion she lived daily companion of
a hideous fear that in time the grue-
some horror must claim her also
cancer deadly terrifying a loath-
some thing crawling upon her she
shivered saul had never known
saul must not know but she bit her
lip between her teeth and prayed
in the waxing light of the star set
upon her sons forehead she dreamed
in her somber silent soul that there
might be born a cure for her bodily
danger and her mental crazing fear

sauls first step toward his colossal
undertaking was to seek out two
men as associates and co-workers he
used his own peculiar methods for
finding those men he said good-bye
to his mother and helene kinkaid
then he started on his quest he
went to some three hundred students
of chemistry and bacteriology took
them aside and propounded to each
four identical questions without pre-
ceding his questions by explanation
or preface of any kind some laughed
at him some surlily dismissed him
some went into long and elaborate
elucidation some stared and edsed
warily away from him judging him
wildly insane only two understood

him instantly only two answered
in the manner in which he wished to
be answered proving themselves the
men he sought men with capacity
for ideals and dreams men with dis-
cernment men who knew no reluc-
tance for the drudgery of an eternal
pursuit and those two in different
words said in gist exactly the same
thing

  saul asked what do you think
henry arn replied quietly   enough
to fill an encyclopedia john cloud
said with slow emphasis more than
i could tell if i talked for twenty
years

  saul asked what do you be-
lieve    henry arn smiled as he said
not so much john clouds eyes
twinkled as he voiced his words
not enough to shout about

  saul asked what do you know
henry arn retorted grimly still
less john cloud shrugged and re-
plied nothing

  then saul asked like a shot
what do you wantf henry am
sighed and shook his head but he
spoke two words to do john
cloud looked away somewhere into
space and answered to give

  when saul blauvette went back to
his barn of a laboratory with its
dusty dirty broken-glass-cluttered
tables wearied with his long search
and eager to begin the business of ac-
tive campaign against cancer he took
with him two willing and intensely
interested assistants-john cloud
and henry arn his gaunt mother
received them and spread their
evening meal searching the faces of
these new men satisfying herself
that they were at least partly worthy
to work with her son of the star

  in the dusty cluttered laboratory
saul made room for dozens of animal
cages of all sizes ranging from a
mouse cage to a monkey cage he
bought pair after pair of beasts rab-
bits guinea-pigs white rats and
three monkeys caught endless mice
the dark chrysalis



and rats and installed them in those
cages he worried and fussed and
spluttered about till he had the place
more cluttered than ever before but
containing easily all his cages and
some hundred-odd animals for ex-
perimental purposes 

  there is this for the spirit of saul
blauvette and the magnitude of his
dream not once did john cloud
who was fastidious nor henry arn
who was meticulous both of them
used to order and methodical neat-
ness in their own deserted spotless
workrooms in far places ever even
notice the shambles of the laboratory
into which they had come to spend
their lives in the pursuing of a monu-
mental ideal they saw only and al-
ways the living soul of the thing saul
blauvette had sworn to do the soul
that challenged them to ever coun-
tenance discouragement to ever fail
of less proportionate effort than he

  sauls first reckless gesture was to
destroy the multitude of microbes liv-
ing and increasing from moment to
moment in the numberless flasks and
bottles about his tables and shelves
he boiled them for hours to make
their death certain and buried them
in a hole in the grove back of the
laboratory over them when the
hole was filled and no one was about
to observe him he said a wild pagan
rite the minute beasts had served
their purpose had satisfied and
whetted his curiosity had lured him
on to more soaring heights heights
of an infinitude too vast for most men
to conceive they must be honored
but they must go they went

  then the small man with the great
dream carried his flasks back to the
laboratory by the armfuls took brief
leave of his mother john cloud and
henry arn and rushed away from
the grove to seek old doe whittly
and helene he hurried into the
doctors office and leaned over his
desk and helene came swiftly from
the inner rooms to look into his enor-

mous eyes and find how the dream
fared saul gripped her hands
hungrily and whittly smiled up at
him the principal subject of con-
versation between the doctor and
helene of late had been sauls tri-
umphant return with two such men
as cloud and arn

  helene im ready to begin my
active campaign the stage is all set
ive collected something like a hun-
dred and thirty animals but-doc  
he turned to whittly with an an-
noyed frown i havent managed to
get one afflicted with cancer to find
the cancer microbe ive got to have
cancer tissue cant you help me
out  

  yes-i think i can sit down
saul whittly gestured toward a
chair and saul sat down on the edge
of it drawing helene to a seat beside
him running his fingers nervously
over her wrist waiting i have a
patient with cancer of the tongue-
he also has cancer of the cheek and
lip god man-the poor old chaps
a hideous sight hes-pitiful crawl-
ing with fear from the soul out i
cant help him-its too late hes
gotten a little crazed over it and he
keeps jabbering about all the other
poor devils who are doomed the
way he is he-oh hes a terrible
sight cant last long yesterday
he was in you saw him helene

  yes helene shuddered shrink-
ing up against saul you mean
that youre-

    exactly   whittly interrupted
he wants me to give his body to
some hospital carrying on a cancer
research department saul instead
ill give it to you poor devil he
makes me ache he wants so to live
and hes got to die good god saul
-if you can do this thing youre
so sure-and helene believes in you
so utterly its almost as though
there were something from some
other world reaching down to tell her
-even i have begun to hope
weird tales

 do more than hope man be-
lieve saul rose from his chair still
gripping itelenes hand for a
moment he stood staring into her
face then he bent and kissed her
swiftly and turned toward the door
he paused once to add a halting sen-
tence doc-its a grisly thing to
say but ive got to get to work
youll let me know-as soon-as soon

  as soon as he passes helenes
voice finished the stumbling words

  i will whittly bowed his head
gravely in a gesture of assent

  saul stared back at helene his eyes
flaming with their wild light then he
was gone

  he went back to his laboratory and
told his gaunt fear-ridden mother
and cloud and arn that the great
campaign was under way with an
angry surge of rebellion in his heart
against those unseen forces that prey
upon men and torture them with pain
and fear cause them decay and
death he cried at arn and weve
got to wait till the old man dies
what a hellish thing we have to
wait while he writhes in fear and suf-
fers and dies so that we can conquer
through his corrupted flesh the
source of the evil and save other men
from like horror wait-wait-sit
around waiting for a man to die but
by god we wont sit around well
do something

  what cloud asked curtly

 set to work and develop some
cancers of our own-on those beasts
of ours by the process of irritation
come on lets get to work

nphey took four guinea-pigs three
- rats and six mice and upon their
sensitive bellies painted a round spot
the size of the largest proportionate
free area painted them with soot and
tar stinging oils and irritating gums
the little brutes wriggled and
squealed and saul in his pity for
their pain and the pity for the neces-

sity of it put out of his mind the
thought of the old man dying of can-
cer he set his attention savagely
upon the squirming rats mice and
guinea-pigs while cloud and arn
stood at his elbow and painted tar
and oils at his directions and his
mother shifted like a somber shadow
in the living rooms next the labora-
tory

  every day and twice a day he and
his men painted the spots on the
animals bellies with the noxious sub-
stances and time went by a month
slid by and saul broke away from
the laboratory for a white hour with
ilelene but never once to her nor
to whittly did he mention the old
man with cancer inarticulately
whittly understood and kept his
own grim silence he knew sauls
thoughts and quivered at their im-
port waiting for a man to die an
old man who need not have died so
soon an old man crushed under a
horror that was worse than his pain
waiting hideous business neces-
sary business waiting for an old
man to die and be cut up and run
through a microscope

  and saul went back to the labora-
tory to pace furiously up and down
the long stinking cluttered room
talking an incoherent jumble of
words to himself trying to think
of helene trying to keep the pic-
ture of a ghastly old face from com-
ing in between him and the vision of
her eyes pausing to examine guinea-
pigs rats and mice shooting flaming
words at henry arn listening to the
hypothesis of john cloud trying to
forget the old man - trying not to
wish he would hurry up and die
shrinking at the persistent bitter
urge that the old body was needed
horrible to wish a man would die to
cheat him of even a day of ugly life
some old man with a terrible face
a man whose very name he did not
know did not want to know let him
remain so unknown obscure an
the dark chrysalis



anonymous gift of sacrificial rite to
the great cause of science

  waiting another month slid by
three months four months of mad
experimenting flecked with hours of
pause glorified by helene kinkaid
by her unwavering faith and words
to cheer him on months of welter-
ing work in the stinking laboratory
and on the bellies of three guinea-
pigs two rats and four mice small
warts began to appear feverishly
saul and his co-workers continued to
apply the irritants watching wait-
ing but they were no longer wait-
ing for an old man to die they had
probably started some experimental
cancers of their own on the animals
they waited for those cancers to de-
velop they forgot all about the old
man it was then the old man died

 whittly sent for saul saul
knowing what the summons meant
took cloud and arn with him and
hurried to the doctors office where
the doctor had taken the wasted
disease-eaten body they three stood
by whittly and stared at the grue-
some thing that had been a man
stared at the ghastly putrid mass on
his cheek and lip and forgot even that
they had waited for him to die they
remembered only that they were
scientists and experimentalists fol-
lowing in the wake of a gigantic vi-
sion they remembered sharply that
because he had died a million others
might be saved the same awful end
with whittlys aid they wrapped up
the body and under cover of the night
carried it to the laboratory

  whittly took one look at the long
barnlike room glanced at the sheet-
ed body on the table bade them a
hasty good-night and turned his back
upon the ghoulish task that lay be-
fore them saul never even glanced
around as the door closed behind the
departing doctor and arn leaned over
to lift the sheet from the still body

  from then on through the night
the three scientists took little heed of

the hours marching toward the dawn
they cut from the old mans throat
the putrid remains of his tongue and
from his cheek and lip the other can-
cerous growths they dissected the
cancers into small pieces and put the
pieces in fifty small flasks all but
one of the flasks they rendered air-
tight by fusing their necks in flame
then they washed their hands in
bichloride of mercury to kill clinging
menacing germs and began dissecting
the body from each section of the
body from hand to liver omitting no
organ nor part they took other
diminutive pieces of flesh and sealed
them in other flasks while in the ad-
joining house saul s mother lay white
and sleepless shrinking at the knowl-
edge of the hideous work going on in
the laboratory and away in her
white-walled room knowing also
helene prayed and both women kept
their eyes in blind faith on the star
set in sauls forehead

before daylight three grim scien-
tists buried what remained of
that nameless aged man whose sacri-
fice called to their highest efforts
through virtue of his agonies rever-
ently they buried him saying over
him a requiem of sadness for his
pain and a prayer that their seeming
desecration of his wretched flesh
should not be in vain then saul led
the way back to the laboratory where
ninety-two flasks with their grisly
contents were littered over tables and
ehairs and shelves the one flask not
sealed stood near one of the powerful
microscopes ready for the first step
of investigation saul halted in front
of the microscope staring at the
corked flask and his hands trembled
as he pulled the cork picked up a tiny
spun glass tube and sucked into it a
drop of cancer-juice from the flask

  servetus was burned to death in
geneva three hundred and seventy-
three years ago for just what we did
tonight am said soberly thinking
weird tales

of the dissected body laid away under
the trees

  saul raised his head from his task
and glanced into arns face with a
sudden startled sense of premonition
burned to death for cutting up the
body of a man but that was cen-
turies ago no longer were men
burned for advancing the cause of
science this was the twentieth cen-
tury yet for a moment something
swept over him that made him shrink
he felt that scorching heat of flame
he heard the cries of an angry mob he
breathed the choking gust of billow-
ing smoke he visioned the great lab-
oratory eaten by lurid flames-a
mighty funeral pyre he strove to
put the weird prescience from him
as he stepped back and held up a
shaking hand signaling john cloud
to focus the lens cloud hesitated a
moment and looked sharply into
sauls eyes

    what is it   he asked quickly

  n-nothing saul shook his
head its funny that henry should
say that take a look at that thing
will you john

  cloud frowned glanced at arn and
bent over the instrument saul
wheeled abruptly and began pacing
the floor his face tense and colorless
his eyes blazing why should that
chance remark of henry arns affect
him so maybe it was a warning
they might cause some explosions in
the laboratory with all its inflammable
paraphernalia hed have to watch
out he paused as john cloud
looked up from the microscope and
expended a deep breath

  what do you see he demanded

  nothing cloud shook his head
simply nothing

  but there is something saul
whirled on arn his uncanny sense
of premonition swept away in the
eager interest that caught him he
gestured toward the small glass tube
there must be something look
henry you look

  arn stepped to the table as cloud
got out of his way and sat down in
the chair cloud had vacated he
bent over the microscope and stared
intently through its mighty eye but
no microbe of any size or description
met his searching gaze no little
rods no little wriggling corkscrews
no tiny bulbs with fuzzy noses he
raised his head and shrugged as he
rose to his feet

  no i cant see a tiling saul i
dont think there is anything to see
there must be i tell you saul
frowned and rushed forward to push
him aside do you say there is
nothing because you see nothing the
first time you look dont be idiotic
henry it may take us a year to find
it let me examine that tube
cloud and arn looked on silently
as the little scientist concentrated his
gaze through the lens too powerful
to allow even the most minute sub-
visible microbe to escape unseen he
stared long and silently and cloud
stirred in impatience

 well-what do you find there
isnt anything is there

  saul made no response but sat like
a statue his eye glued to the lens
seeking some tiny germ of death as
reward for their initial search no
germ was visible there to him any
more than it had been visible to cloud
and arn there was nothing at all
in the milky cancer-juice to meet his
gaze grimly he held himself still
searching unwilling to believe that
there was no germ to see yet believe
he must nothing was there he
blinked his eyes shut once and looked
again no nothing there were no
little oblong seeds with crinkly tails
no little spider-like beasts with num-
berless hairy legs no little crazy dots
nothing he looked up from the lens
frowning shaking his head but the
gesture was one of negation merely
it held no hint of discouragement or
impatience
the dark chrysalis



    no i dont see anything he ad-
  mitted but that doesnt say there
  is nothing to see perhaps we didnt
  get any germs in that particular atom
  of fluid well on with the dance
  well pulverize the tissue and put it
  all through the microscope every
  drop in that flask well find that
  microbe if its the last thing we ever
  do

   john cloud and henry arn nod-
 ded silent agreement and roused
 themselves to renewed effort they
 brought other test-tubes they
 crushed the cancer fiber in the flask to
 a characterless pulp flesh and juice
 and drop by drop they ran it under
 the mighty lens nothing rewarded
 them no visible microbe was there
 by then it had passed the dawn and
  the three men were worn to nervous
 exhaustion saul abruptly corked the
 flask into which they had replaced
 the crushed portion of the cancer
 washed his hands in bichloride of
 mercury and went into the adjoining
 house to lie down on his bed and
 strive for sleep cloud and am fol-
 lowed his example his mother hear-
 ing his step sighed deeply turned
 over on her cool white sheet and
 closed her eyes she slept deeply but
 there was little sleep for the three
 men in the rooms beyond hers

   at  in the afternoon saul rose
 from his fitful inadequate rest and
 hurried into the laboratory burned
 by the thing that eluded him driven
 by his brain that shouted to know
 john cloud was there before him
 wandering restlessly about the clut-
 tered room examining the cancers be-
 ginning to form on the bellies of the
 animals waiting for saul to come and
 renew the search saul greeted him
 with brusk tenseness and reached for
 one of the sealed flasks just as henry
 arn followed him into the laboratory
 that day the three repeated their ef-
 fort to find some menacing organism
 of life in the first of the fifty cancer-
 filled sealed flasks the result they

 achieved precisely paralleled that of
 the day before midnight found them
 replacing that second portion of can-
 cer in its flask and resealing it against
 a future day

   the next day they opened the third
 flask and the next day the fourth
 and still the result was the same no
 microbe showed of any kind in any
 place so it went for fifty days for
 fifty days three valiant men search-
 ing after the germ of death pored
 over the microscopes crushed the
 grisly pulp from the dead mans
 tongue lip and cheek placed it bit by
 bit under the microscope stared at it
 long and silently only to replace it in
 the flask from which they had taken
 it knowing a baffled sense of failure
 and discouragement

   sauls grim gaunt mother hovered
 in the background like a silent
 shadow cooking their meals watch-
 ing their haggard fanatical eyes
 hugging her secret horror and pray-
 ing her hopeless prayers and she
 thought of helene helene waited
 dumb apart

  had not john cloud and henry
arn fed the rats guinea-pigs mon-
keys rabbits and mice the animals
would have died before their term of
usefulness was begun saul forgot
them completely he was as a man
crazed by the time they three had
examined and resealed the last of the
fifty flasks their brains were weary
with strain their eyes red-rimmed
 with too much looking and too little
sleep their hands were blackened
with bichloride of mercury and they
had discovered precisely nothing

   im going to submit the contents
 of one flask to blue aniline dye
 saul announced impatiently with
 the air of a man angered at the thing
 that eluded him he glanced about
 the dirty laboratory where the grisly
 flasks with their hidden ugly secret
 were scattered about in unorderly
 profusion   if that shows nothing
 well try a porcelain strainer it


weird tales

 may be that the cancer microbe is
 utterly invisible colorless as water
 and that the dye will bring it to light
 well try anyhow well double up
 on it ill use blue dye henry and
 you and john use red damn it were
 going to find that microbe not
 once had he even thought of consid-
 ering that there might be no microbe

  henry arn nodded his tired head
and set to work he lighted an
alcohol lamp and prepared the dye
while john cloud for the second time
broke open a flask and brought for
their research a small part of the
crushed cancer pulp in the very
dust of the laboratory hope and tense
interest vibrated as the three men
threw themselves into the new experi-
ment saul dyed pulp a bright blue
while cloud and am dyed other pulp
a flaring scarlet there was a
breathless hush over the cluttered
room when finally the dyed stuff
from the dead mans tongue was
placed under the lenses and three
men looked till their eyes ached and
their vision blurred but it was as be-
fore nothing

  what in blazes are we going to
do now clouds voice was harsh
with strain and his haggard eyes de-
manded guidance of the man who had
instituted the wild soul-breaking
quest i cant conceive of any man-
ner in which we can extend our
search save by the porcelain of which
you spoke my god saul-any
microbe ought to show up in some
fashion unless its so utterly minute
it cant be seen

  he got up from the table as he
spoke removing with an idle hand
the small glass rod from the red dye
as he did so one drop of the crimson
fluid dropped on the small portion
of blue-dyed pulp lying on a thin
glass slide by sauls microscope red
and blue the colors fused and turned
a rich purple no one noticed it but
henry am idly almost without

curiosity he sucked up a portion of
the purple mess and placed the glass
tube containing it under the micro-
scope bending to glance at it with
weary indifference for a moment
his eyes riveted and stared then the
weary indifference vanished and he
cried out with a vehemence that
caused cloud and saul to start and
fix on him their wondering eyes

  what have you found saul
asked sharply

  i dont know but ive certainly
found something arn pointed at
the lens shaking with excitement
the fusing of the two dyes has
shown up your microbe saul look
at him

saul leaped to the microscope and
squinted through its powerful
eye am and cloud watched him
with fascinated gaze as he caught his
breath and stared through the lens
a large microbe dyed a dirty purple
showed clearly in the spun glass tube
it was fully a thousandth of an inch
long with a globular hairy body and
eight long arms that continually
reached out and groped for something
to grasp and devour it was hideously
like a devil-fish in miniature

  saul watched it for a moment in
stunned silence then lifted his head
and turned to john cloud the gleam
of exultation was in his enormous
eyes and his voice shook as he cried
look john henrys found it a
devil-fish microbe its a whopper
too now weve got to work like hell
look

  cloud grinned wanly at the ludi-
crous cry as he stepped quickly to the
microscope and sat down to examine
the grisly microbe it writhed and
groped cloud shuddered involun-
tarily and shifted the tube five
other microbes of the same species ap-
peared in the thin tube of glass for
a moment a breathless hush settled
the dark chrysalis



over the laboratory as three men
stared at each other and knew what
they had discovered cloud rose
slowly to his feet his eyes on sauls
intense face all three of them knew
they were gone a good way over their
long-seeming hopeless road

  then they proceeded to do what
saul had said they must do - to
work they hurried frantically till
dawn and the first light found them
red-eyed weary and shaken but
triumphant they had in those
lapsing hours opened the fifty flasks
containing the cancer tissue taken
from each flask a portion to dye and
examine experimenting disclosed
early in the night that neither by
first applying the red dye nor by
first fusing the two colors and then
dyeing the pulp would the microbe
appear some freakish result of us-
ing first the blue dye and then the
red made the gruesome atom visible
but by dawn the three men had
proved conclusively that their new-
found devil-fish microbe was swarm-
ing in every flask of cancer tissue

  saul mad with the fever of the
search refused to stop for rest even
though he swayed on his feet from
weariness cloud and arn rubbed
their smarting eyes shook themselves
wider awake as their lids drooped in
sheer exhaustion and grimly fol-
lowed in his wake they turned them-
selves to the task of examining the
pieces of healthy tissue they had taken
from the old mans body and sealed
in the other flasks they put them
through the process of dyeing and
submitted them to the eye of the
mighty lens through every portion
of the dead mans body-tissue un-
touched by the cancerous growth the
devil-fish microbe swarmed and
groped and crawled

  well thats that saul leaned
back in his chair and rubbed his
burning eyes watching cloud reseal
the last of the flasks weve found

the microbe its a lollapalooza
isnt it but theres so much more
to be done that i hardly know where
to begin you two are dead on your
feet so am i lets turn in for a
few hours sleep then im off to see
old doc whittly

  the three trooped wearily out of
the laboratory and saul paused at
the door to glance back at the flasks
littering tables and shelves there
was a grim light of triumph in his
enormous eyes and cloud and arn
understanding walked on and left
him alone with the first vision of his
great dreams possible fulfilment his
mother seeing cloud and arn come
in without him slipped to the labora-
tory door and he turned hearing her
step beside him she saw the light
on his face and the solemn stillness
in his eyes

  you-found it she whispered
and hope struck at her secret horror

  weve found it saul nodded
but there his tongue stopped

  she knowing him better than any
other laid her arm across his shoul-
ders and they stood in a hush star-
ing together at the flasks filled with
the purple-dyed tissue which had at
last yielded up its ugly secret then
without a breath of warning saul
fainted against her she lifted him in
her strong lean arms carried him to
his bed laid him down and bent over
him he was breathing regularly in
the deep sleep of utter exhaustion
she pulled down the blinds walked
back to him and paused to lay her
hand on his forehead she fancied
she felt the five points of a star saul
moved and muttered in his sleep
muttered the name helene
helene his mother winced she had
not yet been able to accept helene as
tangible reality not again had saul
spoken of her not once had the girl
eome near the laboratory but the
girl was in whittlys office and saul


weird tales

went there more often than he would
have done to see whittly alone and
he muttered helene in his sleep
his mother set her lips tightly she
wanted to see the girl and again she
shrank from seeing her from even
speaking of her

  must she give saul up to this other
younger woman glive him up or
share him which she turned with
an empty feeling at her heart walked
out and left him to his rest and
henry arn glancing out of his win-
dow as he got into bed saw her kneel

	lay a sheaf of flowers on the grave
of the old man under the trees

long before cloud and arn awoke
saul shook himself out of his
exhausted slumber got to his feet and
hurried into the laboratory he
fussed around at grim business with
a sharp blade and dyes and the
microscope satisfied with what he
wanted to know he snatched his hat
and rushed off to old doe whittlys
office whittly sat at his desk writ-
ing out a prescription and helene
stood arranging instruments in the
cabinet both of them looked across
the room at saul as he opened the
door and stepped inside their gaze
made a swift survey of the little
scientists drawn face his red-rimmed
eyes his bichloride-blackened hands

    saul   helene walked swiftly to-
ward him hands outstretched to meet
his frowning in anxious solicitude
youve got to go slower youre
burning yourself up you need
rest

  i rest-here saul slid into a
chair and drew her into his arms
laying his head wearily against her
shoulder

  helenes right the old doctor
put in shortly shaking his head in re-
proof youll have to let up a bit or
youll never last through have you
found anything yet how long have

you been fussing with that cancer
tissue anyway

  it seems a year helene said
her sober eyes on sauls tired face

  its really a little less than two
months sauls smile flickered at
her but the light in his eyes flamed
and-weve found the microbe
a horrible little freak looks like a
devil-fish  

  you found it whittly started
leaning toward the scientist

 oh saul you found it
helenes arm slipped across sauls
shoulder gripping him close and her
face glowed as he answered

  we found it all right but
thats only the beginning helene-
doc the real racket is all to come
the microbe wasnt in the cancer
alone but all over the mans body
now ive got to determine whether
or not it appears in the healthy tissue
of a body unaffected by cancer or if
it appears in any other disease are
you performing any operations today
and tomorrow doc

  seven whittly replied and
helene looked at the face against her
shoulder wonderingly six minor
and one major why

  any of em got cancer

  nary a one saul the worst is
a case of appendicitis what are you
getting at now

  i want a snip of flesh from each
of those people a piece no bigger
than a grain of eorn helene will
you get seven bottles from that mess
in my coat pocket next you i only
rest here i dont want to move give
em to doc will you put each piece
in a separate bottle doc and ill
come for them day after tomorrow i
want to see if i can find the cancer
miciobe in any of em

  helene shivered involuntarily as
she slipped her hand into his pocket
counted out seven little vials from
the dark chrysalis



the dozen or so there and extended
them toward whittly her heart
flinched within her as she thought of
their purpose

  saul-saul dear youre ghast-
ly

    ghastly is right   whittly agreed
grimly   but its necessary ghastli-
ness it isnt exactly ethical its a
crazy thing to do-but ill do it of
course i can easily and no one ever
the wiser save helene id do a good
deal to help you win such a fight
young man give me another bottle
helene  

  what for helene raised her
brows wonderingly as she slipped her
hand again into sauls pocket

  oh ill give him a snip off my
big toe grinned the doctor i
might as well help the good cause
along he and arn and cloud will

  yes of course saul nodded
ive already tested my own flesh-
this morning after i got up passed
through the laboratory on my way
here there wasnt a sign of one
in me helene-what are you do-
ing his eyes caught her hand in
the act of passing to whittly not one
but two more of the little bottles and
in her eyes he read her intent his
face whitened a visible shade and he
cried out a violent protest no not
you god no i couldnt do that
helene put that bottle back not
you 

  she hesitated and he took one of
the bottles from her hand shoving it
quickly back into his pocket and ex-
tending the other toward whittly
whittly mumbled something about
putting the vials away got up from
his chair and went into the other
room

  good old doc saul dropped
his head back against helenes
shoulder and the weary lids drooped
over his enormous eyes lord i am
tired let me rest

  rest helene whispered clasp-
ing him close be still and rest
for if you break the world loses its
hope a hundred years too soon oh
saul saul dont you know that
men like you are born but once in a
hundred years

  i know that women like you are
born but once in a hundred centu-
ries    sauls arms gripped in a swift
convulsive embrace without you
i might break but here-i rest
with you i can go on for eternity
there was silence in the doctors
grubby little office silence and the
sweep of the wings of morning wings
that brush from a man weariness of
soul for half an hour that might
have been a moment or an eternity
neither of them moved saul still
against her shoulder slept then he
wakened kissed her and went away
without a word to break the glory of
that hush went seeking cloud and
am found those two in the labora-
tory curiously examining the tube in
the microscope that held his own
flesh

  say saul what the devils this
cloud demanded the moment he en-
tered the room human flesh with-
out a cancer microbe certainly but
it cant be out of one of the flasks
no its off my hide saul
answered quietly ive got to find
out whether or not that microbe ap-
pears in healthy bodies unassailed by
cancer it isnt in me whittlys go-
ing to furnish me with sample pieces
of flesh from seven different bodies
besides his own in the next few
days  

in the meantime well just see
how i stack up cloud replied quick-
ly i was going to do it anyway
me too arn seconded and
the sooner the quicker

  saul nodded as he took off his hat
and hung it on a peg in the wall his
gratitude flaming to the two men who

were busy through the next hour

of the devil-fish microbes wriggling
around and groping their ghastly
arms

 now what in blazes does that
mean am turned to saul paling
at the sight

  i think i can tell you exactly
what it means saul replied his
enormous somber eyes on henrys
face but well have to prove it
conclusively before we tell the world
it means that the cancer microbe is
in some people and isnt in others
where it comes from and how it gets
into people is something else weve
got to determine a person with those
microbes in his flesh might live to a
healthy old age and die sound-if he
lived cleanly and rightly but let
some part of his body become devital-
ized either through misuse disuse or
abuse and the microbe gets in its
work it cant devastate healthy
tissues and people uninfested with it
cant get cancer if they want to
women are more subjected to devital-
izing influences than men-thats
why more of them die of cancer i
told doc whittly that was the way it
worked when i first began the big
job and i havent changed my opin-
ion yet i intend proving it

  henry nodded staring down at the
little tube that held his flesh and the
minute devil-fish his faith in the
little scientist knew then its first spur
of fear those beastly little bugs
were crawling around in his body
waiting the moment to seize upon
some devitalized tissue and make of

him a living horror he started to
speak and the voice of sauls gaunt
and silent mother halted him all
three men turned quickly to see her
standing in the doorway holding out
toward saul a little piece of blood-
washed flesh

  here saul from my side see
if they are in me

 but mother saul sprang to-
ward her his face wrinkled in lines
of shocked dismay you shouldnt

-youre not a scientist-

  im a scientists mother mrs
blauvettes head went back proudly
and she looked down into his eyes
with the dignity of her pride in him
as she steadily held toward him the
small piece of flesh look i want
to know

  saul bowed over her hand and took
the particle of tissue gently from her
palm cloud and arn stood back in
a veiled silence looking the other
way while the little scientist swiftly
prepared the dye and reverently put
through the process the flesh of the
woman he so loved it was so still in
the laboratory that apparently not a
soul breathed as he sucked the atom
he had prepared into the tube and
put it in the microscope long and
steadily his enormous eyes stared
through the powerful lens then he
raised his head and looked calmly
into her face

  not a one you couldnt get a
cancer if you lived to be a thousand
years old

   ah  she breathed deeply once
then shot at him a sudden question
but how do you know people cant
contract those microbes-cant be-
come infected with them at any
time   

 i dont know saul admitted
quietly but i believe their posses-
sion to be a congenital condition
thats something else ive got to
prove but you are immune now at

a five-minute story

the fourth
dimension

by charles ford

ripley sang aloud in pure joy
as the bladelike bow of his
racing canoe slipped through
the water the wind was northwest
and puffy and the lake showed a
lively blue and white under the sky
as he came about over to windward
he could see the green of the golf
links slanting up from the waters
edge and the white clubhouse gleam-
ing through the trees overhead the
white and tinted clouds sailed before
the wind hardly dimming the sun-
shine it was a pretty picture from
the water and he loved it as the
wind heeled the canoe over his mus-
cular legs shot him up to windward
and the lively craft swished through
the water every puff wetting the sails
half-way to their peaks and shower-
ing him with spray golf and tennis
were good but nothing wiped out the
worries of a difficult and precarious
business as did the little canoe it
needed skill muscle and quick wits-
a mans play

  starting his sheets a bit he stood
out into the lake and hauled her into
the wind again then a vicious blast
came down the hill the slide jammed
and he went over

  a ducking was the least of his
troubles he was used to it but this
time something went wrong his
head struck a spar and when at last
he found himself swimming easily to-
ward the boathouse that showed its
gay awnings in a little cove below the
clubhouse he thought he must have

been unconscious for a minute or two
pulling himself up on the float he
turned but could see nothing of the
capsized canoe

  ill send jimmy out for it he
said to himself and went into the
locker room for a rub-down it
struck him as rather singular that
when he went out float and boathouse
and locker room had been gay with
many-colored canoes and girls in
summer dresses and men talking over
golf scores and exchanging alibis and
experiences now everything was
quiet but for a few men he didnt
know talking soberly in the locker
room

  well that ducking took miller off
my mind for a while anyhow queer
that crack on my skull didnt raise a
lump he mused rubbing his head
cautiously

  jimmy did not appear by the time
ripley had changed and he took out
his clubs and strolled up the slope to
the first tee he felt a little tired and
dazed and it might be amusing to
watch them drive off perhaps he
would feel like playing a few holes if
some acquaintance showed up about
the time miller began pestering him
again but it wasnt the miller busi-
ness that puzzled him now the tee
was the same railing and water-can
and sand-box were just where they
belonged the narrowing vista of the
first fairway with the green and its
tiny flag perched up on a knoll four
hundred yards away were as usual

                                   


weird tales

the long ranks of translucent clouds
sailing down the wind with their
shadows flitting down the hill ahead
of them were just as they had looked
from the lake out there several rac-
ing canoes like his own danced over
the whitecaps and heeled down be-
fore the puffs of wind that puzzled
him his had been the only one of
that type of canoe left on the lake be-
cause they were thought pretty risky
for such treacherous water golfers
drove off several foursomes and
passed on up the course but he didnt
seem to know one of them they
seemed to be having a good time but
there wasnt any of the usual loud
chaffing about handicaps and bets
even the caddies were subdued
somehow things were different

  a tall man with a long clean-
shaven pleasant face sat down beside
him nursing between his knees a
formidable outfit of clubs there was
something about him that stirred rip-
leys recollections but he couldnt
place him ripley nodded however
and the stranger greeted him pleas-
antly

  i dont think ive met you before
youre mr ripley arent you my
names longdon

  ripley stared a little where had
he heard of longdon there was a
famous racing-canoe man of that
name but somehow it stuck in rip-
leys mind that the longdon he was
thinking of had been in the navy dur-
ing the war and had lost his life sav-
ing a lot of others from an explosion
on board a destroyer this man
couldnt be the same longdon

  playing today asked longdon

  ripley shook his head   i thought
i would but im a little tired he
said just had a bad spill on the
lake and my head doesnt seem quite
right got a knock against the mast
going over i think i  hunt up
jimmy and get him to go out after my
canoe

  if you dont mind ill walk down
with you for a cigarette longdon
said and together they went down
the slope to the boathouse longdon
clipping dandelion heads with his
putter as they strolled along ripley
was aware of a certain restraint
about his companion as if he wanted
to say something and didnt quite
know how to go about it they
reached the landing and sat down on
a bench looking out over the water
and smoking in silence

  suddenly ripley saw a queer thing
it seemed as if the pretty scene be-
fore them rolled aside and out there
was a dory where there had been no
dory before three men were in it
dragging for something in the lake
and alongside the dory was a cap-
sized canoe its green hull and a bit
of white sail showing on the water

  longdon looked at him sympa-
thetically but ripley couldnt under-
stand the look

  why thats my canoe cried

ripley jimmy must have-

what in the world are they drag-
ging for

  longdon said it is your canoe
dont you understand now
it was seldom that charles
breinbar was excited that he
was excited then meant two
things first that the matter was
vastly important second that no
crisis was immediately imminent for
in a crisis no man was ever more col-
lected than he

   yes  he was speaking in the ex-
plosive style which characterized him
when excited if we fail-the
whole world dies and for me it is
-vengeance as well come look and
listen and he dragged me to some
of his apparatus whirling the con-
trol dials he motioned for me to
watch a screen there was a rapid
play of lights and shadows much as
though i was looking at the reflection
on a ceiling of a water surface dis-
turbed by ripples suddenly he
reached the right combination the
movement ceased and there was
shown plainly a snow-covered sur-

    w tv-

 face and on it was sprawled the body
 of a man seemingly dead i looked
 at breinbar questioningly

   yes dead he answered my un-
 voiced question that is an old
 friend amos toble yesterday i got
 a letter from him said he was on a
 trip-up on the dubaunt thought it
 would amuse me to see him and so i
 turned the dials for him saw him
 tramping along he eame on a small
 animal dead picked it up seemed
 puzzled picked up another also
 dead it puzzled him he walked

-	on suddenly he stumbled seemed
 to regain his balance then collapsed
 quite dead 

   i quickly turned the dials to the
 q vibrations they show up what
 we cant see by ordinary light you
 know i knew i would see his spirit
 but i did not expect to see it strug-
 gling with something trying to get
 back into his prone body while the

                                    


weird tales

thing tried to hold him off he was
forced farther away farther and-
my god i suppose there is no reason
why a spirit should not sxiffer but
i never expected to see one suffer as
he did but he lost it was the thing
which slipped into the body but
seemed to find it in some way unfit-
ted lor it left and swept away the
spirit of poor toble battling-bat-
tling so for me it now means ven-
geance

  perhaps you recall the sensational
tales in the papers some years back
of the arctic death as they called
it they gained no credence for-
tunately luckily for the world it
never knew just what the real truth
was all winter an expanding wave
of death had spread fanlike out of
the arctic into the northern interior
of canada an epidemic in which the
lethal agent was unknown the bod-
ies bore no indication other than the
fact of death and when found soon
enough the fact that they were
frozen like ice yet it was certain that
freezing was not the cause of death
it was an epidemic of unparalleled
deadliness when a community was
stricken every vestige of life was de-
stroyed so the tales went

  breinbar was continuing neeley
of edmonton was down here last
week told me the papers tell the
truth so i have been watching it
on the screen here i thought at first
it was a medical problem then i
saw it kill toble it must have been
an inspiration turning on the q
rays and catching the things in the
act so i spent last night studying it
i think i know what is happening
but i need help you are game to go
with me good it will be dangerous
but you will have the satisfaction of
knowing that you are taking a fight-
ing chance if we dont take it we
shall all be killed anyway if we take

it maybe- he did not finish

but i could supply the end

  the net result of it all was that a

few days later rigged out in warm
clothing and wearing a peculiar suit
of insulating material with a network
of wires and a battery-like con-
trivance within it breinbar and i set
out in his airplane one morning the
machine was also equipped in a pecu-
liar fashion and we took along sev-
eral strange implements the use of
which i knew nothing of at the time
to complete the weird outfit each of
us wore a mask which completely cov-
ered our heads with eyepieces which
appeared opaque to ordinary light
but were transparent to vibrations of
a wave-length entirely outside of the
visible range of the spectrum and
which moreover so transformed these
vibrations that they became visible to
us and the world appeared to us as
it must to any organism which can
utilize such vibrations naturally the
most peculiar effect of this mask was
that the vibration which it admitted
being present at night as during day-
time we could see equally well in
darkness and daylight becoming in
effect as owl-eyed as we looked

we traveled northward for two
hours before breinbar brought
the plane down on the edge of a tree-
less expanse and near a little settle-
ment which we found to be a trading
post as we had sped northward in
the eery lighting afforded by our
masks a sense of unreality had grown
upon me which increased rather than
diminished when we came to earth
and walked the few hundred yards
to the little trading station

  there we had our first real news
of the death it had not yet
reached that point but that very
morning a little indian village some
twenty miles to the northwest had
been found with its few inhabitants
lifeless their bodies frozen stiff
what had been told in the papers was
seemingly true at least the story
which we heard there was just as it
the arctic death



had been told in the press dispatches

  all morning breinbar sat in the
shelter of a little tent which we
pitched with a map spread out be-
fore him about us were grouped
the curious indians and the few
white people not more than twenty-
in all for some curious reason the
indians did not seem to be especially
fearful perhaps the facts had been
kept from them or perhaps some
streak in their makeup caused them
to regard fatalistically any threaten-
ing danger which they could not see
before their eyes with the whites
it was different they were frankly
fearful and kept plying us with
questions the while breinbar was
plying them obtaining information
which he carefully plotted on his
map

  when he had finished with his map
he called the head man a tall scotch-
man named mcintosh and motioned
for the others to move away

  mcintosh he began i guess
you have it figured out that we have
been sent up here by the government
to study this plague we are going
right on and i believe we shall be
able to check it before long but it
will take some time perhaps weeks

  in the meantime we can give you
no protection and i am going to
warn you now-if you value your
lives dont sleep here tonight
he finished in a tone which carried
conviction to me at least

    gad mister-what is your name 
mister breinbar you dont think it
will be here tonight the tall
scotchman who spoke like an eng-
lishman was palpably terrorized al-
though i took it that it would ordi-
narily take quite a bit to frighten
him

  im sure of it breinbar as-
serted

    but what is the thing  and how
can it kill us tonight when we are
perfectly well now the scotch-
mans questions were evidently

framed more to bolster up his cour-
age than to obtain information

    dont be a fool man get ready
to leave at once you may be too late
now breinbar was looking into
the north as he spoke see he
gesticulated and we looked up along
the trail to where a solitary figure
had been approaching it had begun
to move erratically then suddenly we
saw it stagger and fall

  for gods sake man get your
people and run dont wait for
anything ran breinbar fairly
pushed the scotchman from him
and lie did not have to repeat the
command for before he had finished
the latter was already on his way
toward the buildings calling loudly
to his people frightened the man
may have been but he was no cow-
ard and was turning away from the
opportunity of getting an immediate
start to see that the others were
warned

  breinbar turned quickly to m
meantime reaching inside of his
clothes to press the catch on his pro-
tector quick he said impera-
tively reach in- he did not

wait to finish but himself reached
and quickly locating the button on
my suit pressed it with a sigh of re-
lief

  now were safe for gods sake
never let anything touch that bat-
tery now he turned and looked
toward the people who were stream-
ing from the post in terror-stricken
flight toward the south poor dev-
ils im afraid its too late for them
-nothing we can do for them now
but hope so it wasnt true what
the reports said that the death came
only at night i wondered it didnt
seem-

  before he could finish the rear-
most straggler an indian woman
with a baby staggered a few paces
and fell motionless at her cry the
others turned then shrieking broke
into wilder flight but in vain


weird tales

  one after another fell as though a
machine-gun burst were sweeping
them the last to go was the scotch-
man gigantic among the shorter in-
dians he displayed the most tre-
mendous vitality fighting as though
in the grip of invisible assailants
finally he too pitched forward
dead

  during it all we had been power-
less to aid although i had no idea
nor plan i had started forward but
breinbar restrained me

  stay here they have to die
he was speaking in the jerky fashion
peculiar to him when he was stirred
hundreds more-we only make
right moves-stop it-before it kills
thousands-but not now i felt
his muscles quivering as he gripped
my arm and knew that only his
judgment was holding him back from
following the same impulse to help
the doomed fugitives

  but i objected if we can
protect ourselves cant we do any-
thing to help them

 god not a thing no more
than canute could hold back the sea
beyond hope-unless we reach their
center-paralyze that-there is no
hope for the world the center-we

must if not-and he stopped

as though afraid to think farther

  then suddenly i seemed to see in
the weird light of the mask an ad-
vancing wave of transparent form-
lessness moving along in the manner
of a cloud of gas on a battlefield but
not with the wind against it and it
did not seem to have the consistency
of a vapor but of something more
solid like a gelatinous mass which
rolled along and engulfed the fleeing
figures it was impalpable for it
had passed over us without my hav-
ing detected its presence in any way
yet as it reached and touched each
doomed fugitive it struck him in-
stantaneously with the finger of
death all but the scotchman who
had seemed to sense its existence as

an entity and tore desperately at it
for a moment before he too pitched
forward and through it all i felt
absolutely nothing except the sensa-
tion of awful chill which was at first
pressed back into the submerged part
of my consciousness by the awfulness
of the happenings but after the last
victim had fallen stark it returned to
dominate completely my impressions

  i asked breinbar if he too felt the
chill but his only reply was a harsh
naturally a sardonic gleam in
his eyes as he said it

  and then i noticed that our plane
was covered with glistening ice crys-
tals as though it had been chilled be-
low the dew-point of the air so that
frost was forming upon it hurrying
over to the post buildings i found
that there too the frost was forming
over everything and even water in
containers which had been liquid in
the warmer air of the interior of the
houses was solidifying as i watched
it

 a horrid thought came to my
mind and i rushed to the bodies
hoping that i was mistaken my
horrified fear was justified every
body although but a few short min-
utes before it had been warm with
life was frozen stiff so cold that the
fingers on touching it were burned
as by the touch of liquid air and the
flesh had taken on a horrible yellow-
ish half-transparent appearance

  breinbar had followed me around
observing my actions with that ter-
rible half-amused gleam in his eyes
as though he already knew what i
would find but he ventured no state-
ment beyond a short answer when i
asked him in horror for gods
sake what is it

  you might call it what the pa-
pers do the arctic death was all
he said

  he suddenly became all impatience
again and hurried me on i wanted
to stay long enough at least to get the
bodies under a covering of earth
the arctic death



there is something in human nature
which rebels against leaving the dead
of ones kind for the beasts to mouth
but breinbar would not hear of it

vxe climbed again into the plane
  and advanced into the treeless
plain by short stages with frequent
side flights at the halts between
the short flights breinbar would take
readings with a metallic thermometer
which was a part of his equipment
entering the results on his map i
noticed the figures which he put
down and in spite of the feeling of
intense cold i was surprized at the
degree of cold which they indicated
in a region where forty degrees be-
low zero is a mark reached only once
or twice a winter if that often the
temperatures which he was recording
fell within the first few hours lower
than two hundred fahrenheit degrees
below zero it seemed incredible
that we could live in such a tempera-
ture and i realized that it was only
due to the protection of the insula-
ting suit which i wore that the cold
did not freeze me in an instant out
of curiosity i took the thermometer
and placed it within a few inches of
my body as i had noticed that brein-
bar laid it down then walked away
several feet to remove the influence
of his body to remain away two or
three minutes before he returned
quickly and read it as though afraid
he could not reach it quickly enough
to get the correct reading i was not
altogether surprized to find that the
temperature which surrounded my
body at least within a few inches dis-
tance was much warmer although
quite cold enough being thirty-five
below at a time when the temperature
at a distance of several feet was two
hundred and five-a hundred and
eighty degrees lower

 finally it seemed that he had ac-
cumulated all the information which
he needed for he drew the isotherms
connecting the points of equal tem-

perature on his map obtaining
curves which were distinctly circular
in form with the center definitely
located

  pointing to that center on the map
he turned to me ghats where
weve got to go to find it george if
id only-

  his words were suddenly cut short
as a dark form sprang from behind
us and felled him with the single im-
pact

  i turned to face the thing and the
horror which swept over me on seeing
that form robbed me of what power
i might have had to resist the sin-
isterly powerful bulk of the scotch-
man whom we had left stiff in death
only a few hours before as it
touched me i was galvanized into ac-
tivity by the burning cold of the
frozen hands but i was powerless in
the resistless grasp my only satis-
faction was in noting that the warmth
of my body seemed to cause as in-
tense an agony to him as the searing
cold of his touch did to me he
handled me as one does a hot pota-
to as he trussed me up securely then
turned and as gingerly bound up
breinbar

  all this time he had uttered no
sound nor did he do so even when
about to leave he turned and leered
into my face with a hellish chuckle
but the acme of it all came when as
he took his departure toward the
south again i saw that he was ac-
companied as by a bodyguard by
ranks of round balls of that gelatin-
ous substance each about three and a
half feet in diameter perfectly round
and featureless yet moving rolling
along in perfect order animate
things possessed of an intelligence
as the import of what my eyes saw
began to seep into my brain the
world began to swim around and i
felt myself sinking forward into an
ocean of swirling darkness and noth-
ingness


weird tales

  it was hours later when i returned
to consciousness for while it had
been in the early afternoon when i
had last noted the time it was con-
siderably after sunset although still
light to me through my mask brein-
bar was kneeling beside me chafing
my wrists

  before we went on from that place
i learned more for after the narrow
escape we had just had i wanted to
know something more definite of
what we might expect and i am
afraid i said so with more feeling
than i usually put into my voice
when talking to breinbar now
look here i complained it seems
to me if we are going to be jumped
by dead men and such things i ought
to know more about it than i do

  youre right george my friend
answered i was just thinking that
myself we had a narrow squeak
that time if it had only had
the intelligence to destroy our insu-
lation-well it didnt it could not
have touched us in its natural form
but in the body of the tall scotchman
it had an instrument with which it
could easily have eliminated us from
the affair   he fell silent and i was
afraid he was going to retreat into
his own thoughts again just as i
was on the point of speaking he be-
gan again well it shows they are
not infallible they slipped that
time and now that we are on our
guard i think we have a chance a
fighting chance

  this time the pause was so long
that i did break into it but what
is this thing this intelligence you
are talking about i insisted

  i wont say what it is only what
it might be although it is all we
have to go on and i am working on
the assumption that the hypothesis is
correct he resumed just sup-
pose there is another form of mat-
ter one we can not know through
any sense nor measure but one
which occupies the same space we

do suppose that beings exist com-
posed of such matter suppose that
they are able to dissociate their in-
telligences from their individual
selves and that those then discarnate
intelligences assemble and combine
into one great central intelligence
which functions for the entire race of
beings directing them if you sup-
pose that you can suppose that if
such beings directed in that manner
are responsible for this eruption of
death the only hope we have is in
reaching that central intelligence
and somehow influencing it  

  but i interrupted again you
dont mean to say those were the
balls we saw it cant be

 why not you saw them and
you saw people killed by them you
saw that they and everything they
did was inexplicable by the laws of
nature as we know them how else
would youexplain them

  yes but the intelligence you
speak of-how do you know it ex-
ists and in that form and what
can we hope to do to it i was
sinking into the slough of despond-
ency as the logic of breinbars state-
ments was shown to me as i reasoned
back it was inescapably true it
seemed and as inescapably hopeless
how could we cope with such things
especially if as he was calmly telling
me they operated under the direc-
tion of a pooled intelligence  i could
not even hope to hope

  breinbar did not seem so hopeless
for he said although with consider-
able gravity some day i ean tell
you how i know it sometime when
we have more time right now i am
afraid you will see it all yourself be-
fore long i know we have only one
hope one chance not much but we
can take it fighting

  but my morale was gone and if i
followed and did breinbars bidding
during the time which followed it
was not because i still harbored the
slightest spark of hope but rather
the arctic death



that believing that we and all other
living things were doomed i was
filled with a sullen rage against the
things and a smoldering desire to
close with them and die fighting
hurting them as i knew i could hurt
after seeing the thing which had
been the scotchman cringe at the
touch of my body

memory holds only for the high
spots of the ensuing time i
moved with breinbar as in a stupor
toward the center of the eery plain
where we began to see looming up
a single peak of barren rock more
and more of those hellish balls of
pestilence passed us rolling over the
snow-covered plain and i saw that i
had been mistaken in thinking they
were simple balls without appen-
dages it was true that there were
none except when one was needed for
some purpose then they were able to
throw out from any part of them-
selves grotesquely shaped limbs to
any required length or so it seemed
to us to whom all portions of the
things appeared alike i might have
derived some comfort from the way
in which they rebounded in evident
distress when they inadvertently ap-
proached us too closely i did get a
savage satisfaction from their pain
but i was too deeply steeped in the
apathy of despair for any heartening
emotion

  and the cold grew always more in-
tense there came a time when
breinbar let the thermometer fall
from his numbed fingers after pick-
ing it up and when it struck the
ground metal though it was it shat-
tered into as many pieces as though
it had been brittle glass so intense
was the eold

  did i say we had long since lost
the use of our plane that is easily
understandable with such unearthly
temperatures the only wonder
which is still inexplicable to me al-
though doubtless due to breinbars

planning is that we had its use so
long when it failed even breinbar
appeared to lose hope for an instant
or at least to consider our prospects
more desperate we must win be-
fore our strength failed for of course
we were virtually without supplies
except the few rations of concentrated
food we carried on us the one des-
perate hope to which we clung was
to reach the intelligence which was
directing the things before our
strength gave out

  as i look back now it seems pre-
sumptuous two men matching
strength against the concentrated
power of the intelligence of a world
but it was not it was desperation

  the forward struggle became end-
lessly long and hopeless without end
the death and the cold of the plain
and its dreariness entered into the
very soul until there was nothing but
the consciousness of the endless plain
with its wheeling balls from the outer
spaces of hell itself and back in
the darkness of our minds the dull
compulsion vague and intangible
but potent that we must plod on for-
ever if need be and reach that bleak
monadnock ahead and under the
unreasoning compulsion of that im-
pulse we plunged dumbly on ever
drawing nearer to the goal yet our
progress was so terribly slow

  and the balls came thicker  we
were constantly jostled by them and
while they recoiled as though injured
by the touch we also suffered a sharp
sting of cold at each impact so there
was room for gratitude even in our
numbing minds when the news of
our coming and of the desirability of
keeping out of our way seemed to
spread ahead of us and we were
given a clear passageway

  at last we neared the black-gray
rock and a final crushing despair
overwhelmed me as i saw that the
balls were issuing from the rock it-
self not from any opening into which
we could penetrate if what we


weird tales

sought was inside that huge pile of
unbroken rock how could we ever
reach it i gave up the last shred
of hope a shred which unknown i
must have been clinging to for i
found that i did have it to lose al-
though an hour before i would have
said i had none left so it was noth-
ing but the automatic functioning of
my mind which made my lips form
the words were gone now do
you see those things pass through
the solid rock how can we cope
with that

  but while for the last hour or so
breinbar had seemed almost as dis-
pirited as i his action under what
to me was the most disheartening
sight of all was surprizing even to
me who was almost beyond the reach
of surprize or any emotion save de-
spair he took from his back the
nozzle of something that looked like
the flame-throwers used by the teu-
tons in the world war with a vin-
dictiveness which was unusual in
him although i could easily under-
stand how it had developed he
turned it against the rock and to my
astonishment the solid mass seemed
to fade away

  the consternation which his ac-
tion caused among the animate balls
was easily perceptible they dashed
madly around losing all semblance
to spheres as their appendages ap-
peared and threshed about in all
directions finally order seemed to
be restored by the appearance of
authority although i could make out
none who appeared to take the lead
but the effects of authority were
manifest the balls formed as though
to protect a certain part of the moun-
tain and with a grunt of satisfaction
breinbar turned in that direction i
followed him for the stimulus of ac-
tion had restored me somewhat

  relentlessly we plowed through
their ranks and strangely the ray
which issued from breinbars pro-
jector with power to annihilate the

solid rock itself had no effect on those
hellish balls but if it did not we
ourselves did while we suffered
from the searing touch as they came
into contact with us our touch
seemed a thousand times as terrible
to them for although their spirits
seemed willing enough to die in op-
posing us the agony of our touch was
so excrutiating that it was unendur-
able and as fast as they came into
contact with us they would bound
away twisted into all the contortions
of extreme agony so in effect our
progress was unopposed as we first
forced our way through their ranks
then bit into the solid rock behind
them with the ray

after what seemed an infinity of
slow progress into the depths of
the old mountain advancing into the
tunnel which we were cutting into
the living rock we suddenly broke
through into a blinding radiance a
blinding light in which we blinked
unable to perceive the source of the
radiance finally adjusting our
eyes to the unaccustomed glare we
advanced and came upon it sud-
denly

  it was not what i had been pre-
pared for in fact i was unprepared
for anything certainly unprepared
for a thing which had no form for
it had no dimensions of any kind at
least none measurable by our stand-
ards it was a blinding point of
light suspended in a great chamber
or at least situated in the air in its
center with no visible means of sup-
port one minute point of light
light which while having no single
color one could name yet seemed to
give the impression of all vivid col-
ors one tiny point of energy so
great that it flooded a vast chamber
of many million cubic feet with a
radiance positively blinding even at
its confines exceeding the radiance of
the noonday sun after the first
glance which again blinded me for
the arctic death



the moment i did not care to look at
it directly again

  for it was quickly evident that the
point of light was the thing we
sought it spoke no language how
could a point of light without body
or vocal organs speak yet we easily
received the message it sent and
conversely its answers registered in
our minds showed that it understood
our thoughts though it had no ears
to hear with and as the realization
of the fact came to me i again
thought to myself   how can we con-
tend with an intelligence which reads
our very thoughts

  for it said or at least the thought
was communicated to us what do
you expect to be able to do here
and the thought echoed in my brain
nothing

  the voiceless message went on
now that you have seen me how
do you expect to destroy me whom
you can not touch nor injure with
your machine which is only con-
trived to annihilate matter such as
you know it it can not touch us

  no the voice of breinbar
startled me as he spoke aloud though
the thing had no ears but i have
another weapon which can harm
you  

  you mean could harm me if you
could come close enough the in-
telligence seemed to reprove him
you can not get close enough to get
in range

  i saw by the sudden dejection
which had come over my friend that
what it said was so the weapon
whatever it was had a range far too
limited to reach to the height of that
dazzling point of light we were
limited by the necessity for some-
thing material to stand upon while
it was not

  the next words from the thing if
i can call such thoughts words were
sickening with their revelation even
though what i had already seen must
have prepared me for them the

thought came you want to know
what we mean to do we here in our
situation in the universe find our
state unsatisfactory we see you and
your world so wonderful and you
living in it like brainless brutes so
we are trying by the only means we
have to leave our world and enter
yours you must not think we are
murderers we are simply a higher
form of life supplying our needs
you do not call it murder when you
kill a steer for food for clothing

  yes i know what you are do-
ing breinbar interrupted harshly
but i will not grant the cases are
parallel we hold that you are not
justified either by your law or ours
that you are committing murder
without the justification even of
necessity just to gratify a foolish
wish which if allowed to become a
fact will bring the destruction not
only of us but of your race as well

  again the answering thought came
irritably this time you forget that
it is the law of the maker himself
he whom you call god who directs
all things that there shall either be
progress or death this is progress

  and back came the answer from
the man with no slightest hesitation
while you are talking of the
makers law why do you not remem-
ber that he created our worlds sep-
arate closed all the normal means of
communication from one to the
other do you not think it was with
a purpose you think you can break
those laws and not suffer what
about the one of your race who en-
tered the body of the scotchman mc-
intosh you know how he was
changed to a devil incarnate you
can not break the law separating our
worlds and escape if you persist
you can only bring destruction to
all

  enough of this the answering
thought was sharp with anger we
will not argue we are acting and
you can not prevent it but in a


weird tales

short time you too will be dead we
can not harm you now but we can
wait while you can not and i can
wait very easily when the prize is
your body breinbar   the meaning
of that last sentence nauseated me
but it must have brought a different
thought to breinbar for the thing
reading his mind warned sharply
dont think you can influence me
in that manner

  and then began a debate even
stranger than what had gone before
for i heard only one side of it but
there was no difficulty in supplying
the missing side breinbar no longer
spoke aloud contenting himself with
thinking

  i warn you you can not suc-
ceed the thought came into my
mind from the thing a short
pause with breinbars rejoinder only
having an existence in his mind and
the things then again the thought
oh yes breinbar i should have
thought of that your mind joined
with mine it would be the richest
acquisition i have known but you
are deceiving yourself if you think
you will have power to sway my de-
cisions it is you who will be over-
whelmed  

  the meaning of it began to seep
into my brain and i turned to brein-
bar with a start for gods sake
what are you going to do i asked
knowing in advance what the answer
would be and although i did
know his answer yet i could not re-
press the shudders of horror as he
answered sharply

  it is our only chance i believe
i can dissociate my own intelligence
and join it with that thing of intelli-
gence then-well we can see we
are lost if we dont maybe lost if
we do

  but i objected how are you
going to do that

    i think i can it will help me all
it can for it will always welcome
such acquisitions it said so plain-

ly he was silent a moment then
broke out suddenly now you you
just concentrate on one thought
whatever happens keep willing that
it have no control over you will as
though your life depended on it
which it will that your intelligence
remain in your own body never
drop the thought for a moment until
it is over remember

 yes but you- i was begin-
ning again but he interrupted me
fiercely

 keep still and hold that
thought

  the forcefulness of his utterance
seemed to paralyze my faculties for
the time i was shaking as though
with a violent attack of buck-ague as
i tried involuntarily to follow his
instructions but i could not for
suddenly i felt him go limp beside
me and slump to the floor dropping
to my knees i was horrified to find
that there was no pulse to his body
he was as dead

  then began a time which was the
most terrible i ever experienced
the horror of the attack by the frozen
body of the old scotchman was noth-
ing in comparison i was not old at
the time only thirty-six but when i
returned finally from that experience
under the bleak monadnock my hair
was white and my hand shaking as
with palsy

at first i was unable even to
imagine what was happening
the light began to behave erratically
although i received no brain impulses
from it such as it had sent before
it seemed to expand until it filled the
entire room then contract to the size
of a pinpoint rhythmically it
swelled and shrank pulsating and
while i could not see clearly in the
radiance i did obtain the impression
that the balls themselves recognized
the strangeness of what was taking
place for they had arranged them-
selves in concentric circles rank on
the arctic death



rank centered about that spark of
ultimate glory and if they had pos-
sessed limbs which could have been
designated arms i would have
thought their attitude was that of
prayer

  how long the horrible glory of that
happening lasted i do not know i
was completely lost in it forgetful
of the admonition which breinbar
had given me but the recall came
with a shock for suddenly it seemed
there was something pulling at my
senses as though something were be-
ing drawn from my brain with a
burst of horror i remembered brein-
bar s last words and began to oppose
my will to that which seemed to be
bent on drawing the very life from
my body

  and then it spoke again while
great drops of perspiration ran from
my forehead into my eyes cold
though the chamber was with a cold
like that of space you have lost
the thought came clearly i have
breinbar here and he has been sub-
merged it would be better for you
to come for it would be for you
eternal life as an intelligence you
must come

  and still i fought against the idea
the thing itself my being revolting
against the coming desecration of
life and-a sudden gleam of hope
came as i seemed to hear dimly in my
consciousness a smaller thought en-
couraging holdout hold out for
a time and somehow i did hold
out awhile but there is a limit to
the strain that human nerves can
bear and imperceptibly i slipped
over the margin

  the remainder of the awful experi-
ence does not lie within the memory
of observed fact it has the seeming
of a dream a dream however of such
convincing reality that i am firmly
convinced that it happened in all of
its impossible details for i seemed
to be looking down upon our bodies
mine and breinbars which lay hud-

dled in a heap against the wall while
in my consciousness was a veritable
riot of conflicting thoughts

  the sickening realization seemed to
come to me that i had failed and that
my intelligence had been sucked out
of my body into the being of that
parasitic thing of souls as the
nausea of that knowledge began to
wear off i became conscious of some
of the thoughts which were surging
through the ether and i was sur-
prized to find that all was not har-
mony within that pool of intellect
for there were two factions and as
i began to get my bearings i recog-
nized that the outstanding intellects
among the pool still retained some of
their individuality and that instead
of all being drawn from that strange
plane of life and matter there were
many that represented intelligences
which had once had human form

  then it beeame evident that the
dominant faction which had argued
so cavalierly with breinbar had made
another slip when it thought it could
absorb and submerge his mind within
itself for it soon developed that
the other faction needed only the
leadership which breinbar now sup-
plied to spur it into triumphant ac-
tion

  the following time hours maybe
or minutes is indescribable i can
only chronicle its results at last
after a space of time the length of
which i have not the slightest idea
of harmony was again restored and
sanity with it realization had been
forced even on the most radical ele-
ment of the reservoir of intelligence
that to pursue the mad course it had
embraced would so disrupt the work-
ing of both worlds that all beings in
both would inevitably be extin-
guished but in the struggle i must
confess i played the part of an on-
looker

  and then quiet was restored and
breinbar was again speaking to me in
that mysterious wordless way only

tales

one of us could ieturn to life as we
had known it and he wanted me to
to be the one frank terror in my
awful surroundings combined with
his arguments about my family and
i yielded

  so charles breinbar greatest
scientist of all greater than any will
ever know passed on and lest you
regard him as a pathetic figure a
martyr let me insist that such is
emphatically not the case

  for it is given to me who knew
him and his zest for adventure which
drove him to penetrate the mysteries
of nature farther than any man has
ever done to know that he did not
die that his intellect he himself now

enjoys advantages which i should
envy were i half so curious as he
and in the long evenings as i sit be-
fore the fire and talk with my maida
who was his daughter i see him
plainly endowed now with powers
which were denied even to him while
prisoned in such a body as mine
and i am quite sure that when i am
at work in my laboratory on the ex-
periments which have made me
world-famous it is breinbar who
stands beside me directing for no
brain but his could so directly and
surely solve the problems which i
have solved since that time when the
arctic death threatened our exist-
ence as a race

  fog-faces

by robert s carr

there is something more to fog than merely clammy water vapor-

 there are fat pale leering faces in the dark and lonesome places

where the gray-white little demons in the night-mists love to caper

theres a something gaunt and spectral that takes walks abroad in fog

tis uncertain i will ween it it is ghoulish-none have seen it

but we who walk the woods at night have heard it in the bog

if you should go at midnight to a hidden lowland nook

behind a moss-grown boulder where the wet leaves brush your shoulder
and should crouch among the fog-swirls and should watch and wait and look

it would come wrapped in its garments of miasmal damp gray steam

you could hardly say you hear it yet youd know that you were near it
for youd feel its breath upon your cheek and see its eye-balls gleam

 and as it passed the fog would twist like ghosts of little snakes

the faces would start leering you would see their wet lips sneering

as their master gaunt and spectral stalked away through the cane-brakes

jumped back out of the
loose earth out of the shal-
low grave rose rocusek

would anyone engage a doc-
tor who admitted that he had
buried another patient alive
especially when he admitted that he
had buried the patient to hide the
evidence of murder

  hardly that doctor would be
looked on as a monster in human
form the world would shrink from
him as it would shrink from a leper
or from an unclean beast

  that is why i am revealing myself
only as doctor x

  for i did that thing i buried a
man alive i did it to shield myself
from punishment for his murder

  anyone else would have done the
same thing under the same circum-
stances thats why im telling this
story-this story of what actually
took place in my own life i want
to show how appearances may put
a man in the shadow of the hang-
mans noose

  i am a reputable physician i
graduated from a medical school
which is rated in class a by the
american medical association i
stood fifth from the top in the class
of 

  soon after i arrived in the city
where i now live on the banks of the
upper mississippi river i acquired
the enmity of a rival whom i shall
call dr rocusek little did i know
what horrible results his enmity was
to bring tipon me

  he was a man of peculiar nature
a mixture of a half-dozen european
races he was almost a genius in his
profession and had been highly edu-
cated but his strange moods cost him
many friends and when i invaded
his field many of his patients natu-
rally drifted to me like myself he
was a specialist in nervous and men-
tal diseases

                                     


weird tales

 we met occasionally at social
gatherings and at meetings of the
county medical society and month by
month i found his attitude growing
more and more bitter filially it
reached the point where we were
openly at war

  this silent warfare continued for
three years and all efforts on my
part to heal the breach were rejected
coldly

  imagine my surprize then when
the telephone rang one night as i was
sleeping soundly after a busy day
and on answering i heard dr
rocuseks anxious voice dr x

  yes

  this is dr rocusek doctor i am
terribly sick im afraid im dying
please hurry as fast as you can

  i started to advise the man to call
a general practitioner i was a spe-
cialist in nerve diseases but the re-
ceiver was banged on the hook before
i could speak

  amazed that he should call me i
began dressing if the man was as
near death as he seemed to think i
could not let his past enmity keep me
from helping him

  his house was a mile or so from my
own at the edge of the city and i
pushed my car to its limit as a re-
sult a motorcycle officer on late duty
followed me and caught me at
rocuseks door

  ive got no time to argue i said
shortly theres a man in here dy-
ing im a doctor heres my card

  i handed it to him and ran up the
steps

  rocusek met me at the door

  come in come in he greeted
me pleasantly smiling cordially he
looked the picture of health tall
sleek well-fed black-mustached with
a bow that a courtier might envy

  hows this i demanded star-
tled to have him meet me i thought
you were sick dying

  exactly he said exactly but

come in doctor its cold for you to
be standing there

  bewildered i stepped inside and
set my medical bag in the hallway

  see here i began if youve
got me out of bed on a night like

this-

  he held up a hand protesting
this is np joke doctor he said
i am in deadly earnest but please
walk into the living room

  angry to find that he had appar-
ently called me out needlessly i
stalked into the living room and sat
down to hear his explanation

rocusek followed me into the room
and stood with his back to the
fhe rubbing his hands and warming
himself

  it was a shame to call you out of
bed at this time of the night he
said pleasantly

  im afraid i grunted

  but the truth is doctor he went
on that you will be well repaid for
your trouble you are going to wit-
ness something never seen before in
this world

  i looked up startled

  yes doctor he said you are
going to be my partner in one of the
most fantastic experiments ever un-
dertaken

  you may wonder why i am ask-
ing you to help me in this momentous
experiment the truth is we have
been bad friends long enough i am
ready to call quits but besides that
i respect your medical ability highly
and i need your help

  this may be a ghastly experiment
to watch but you are used to seeing
people die it will not upset you
and i want you to observe the ef-
fects-

  see here rocusek i broke in
i havent said i was going to help
you im not i dont know what
youre talking about and i cer-
tainly dont enjoy being called out of
bed at  a m to take part in some
out of the grave



asinine experiment ill say good-
night

  i rose to go but he stopped me

  you cant go you cant he said
forcefully his dark eyes fixing them-
selves on mine you dont dare i
might die

  i grinned for he looked the picture
of health but he went on hurriedly

  when i heard you at the door i
swallowed the contents of this bottle
it is a deadly poison a derivative of
opium i discovered myself smell
it

  he handed me the vial and i put
it to my nose it had a bitter acrid
smell

  i give you my word doctor this
is no joke he assured me

  hesitatingly i sat down again and
he began talking rapidly

  the story is this he said i
must cut in short i dont know how
soon the poison will take effect

  for many years as you may have
known i have been trying to find
some means of dissociating personal-
ity-separating mind and body

 think what it would mean
while my body lies in this room my
mind would travel to the ends of the
earth in the flash of an eye as quick-
ly as my thoughts could direct it

  imagine it we could see every-
thing travel everywhere without
moving from this room we could
talk to a friend in san francisco or
hongkong without rising from our
chair can you see the immensity of
the idea

  yes i snapped it would be
wonderful but it cant be done

  it can it can he shouted
this will do it he shook the
poison bottle aloft

  ive found the drug opium you
known partially releases the mind
from the body yet the mind is not
wholly free it is still tied down

  i conceived the idea of cracking
the atoms of opium-making it a
hundred times more powerful i

worked at it for years finally i
perfected it

  but that wasnt enough in that
state it was rank poison i wanted
something that would keep life in the
body while the soul-the mind-
wandered at will

  now ive found it another
drug mixed with the first one im
positive it will work im betting my
life on it but its not sure theres
a chance

  i dont know what will become of
me i dont know whether i shall
keep the voice you hear now whether
i shall see as i do now whether i
shall hear as i do now

  nor do i know how my body will
be affected perhaps when my mind
leaves my body will seem dead may-
be it will seem to be in a coma

  those things i do not know
those are the things you are to
watch

  this is madness i interrupted
sheer madness you will kill your-
self i refuse to take any part-

  i broke off in the middle of my
sentence rocusek was dying before
my eyes

  his face took on a deathlike pal-
lor then there was a mighty con-
vulsion that shook his whole body

  i leaped from my chair and rushed
for my medical bag in the hallway
with frantic haste i raced through
the hallway madly punching the
walls for the light buttons until i
reached the kitchen it seemed hours
before i had drawn the water to make
a hypodermic of apomorphine-the
most effective antidote

  i ran back to the front room

  death met my eye

  i was certain of it rocusek lay
huddled in a heap on the floor
thrown from his chair by one of his
mighty convulsions

  i felt for his pulse as i pulled back
the sleeve for the hypodermic there
was no pulse


weikd tales

  cursing myself for letting the man
die before my eyes i plunged the
hypodermic needle into his arm

  there was a chance-just a chance
-that i might not be too late some
faintest flicker of his pulse might still
remain too faint for me to detect

  i shot down the plunger forcing
the apomorphine deep into his flesh

  i bent down and put my head to
his chest i listened desperately de-
termined that no slightest flicker of
life should escape me i would not
abandon my efforts to save his life
until he was unquestionably dead-
dead beyond any hope of returning to
life through the mysterious drug

  there was no sign of life his
heart had stopped his breathing had
stopped his face had the waxy look
that tells even the layman of death

  still i did not give up my efforts
i filled the syringe once more this
time with a double dose of apomor-
phine if this failed he was dead
beyond all hope

  i waited-in vain how i cursed
myself to sit there like a fool like
a schoolboy listening to his tale of
separating mind and body

  why had i been such a fool why
hadnt i held him if necessary while
i injected an antidote

  i laughed aloud bitterly to sit
quiet while a man deliberately killed
himself

  i bent over once more and listened
to his heart

  silent

  i rose unsteadily to my feet my
hands were shaking as with ague

ihad seen death many many times
but never had i been affected like
this never before had i sat by and
let a man die watched him die and
stirred no hand to aid him

  my whole body shook with excite-
ment i think i nearly fainted

  i lifted his body and carried it to
a davenport at one side of the room
my thoughts were in a whirl for a

long time i stared at that waxy face
those strangely contorted limbs

  he succeeded i said to myself
grimly he has separated his body
and soul right enough

  finally i shrugged my shoulders
he was dead no question about it
now what to do

  obviously i must notify the
coroner my eye glanced about the
room for a telephone

  what would i tell him why of
course i would have to tell him that
the man had died of opium poison-
ing

  it would have to be reported as a
suicide of course suicide the
motive-

 what had been the motive i
wondered about that rather idly
what would the papers say fi-
nances ill-health love

  none of these well what would
they say that he had been hunting
for a way to separate body and soul

  what a flimsy motive for a suicide
no one would believe that

  suddenly a thought struck me
would it be called suicide my
heart leaped into my mouth

  what reason was there for anyone
to think he had committed suicide
he was in good health apparently
had some means had suffered no mis-
fortune in love

  why should he commit suicide as
an experiment bosh

  i could see the scornful look on the
faces of the coroners jury

  murder that was it murder
dr x killed him they had been
enemies theyd had a quarrel
doctor x gave him poison  

  i went cold all over the sight of
that waxy face threw me into a panic

  murder already i could feel the
noose tighten about my neck i
choked

  fear made me leap to my feet i
would flee leave that damned body
here it was not my fault i hadnt
killed him
out of the grave



  i must eseape no one must see
me go the world would never know

  i grabbed my medical kit mustnt
leave anything here they would run
me down put me in jail try to drag
a confession out of me tell them it
was an experiment  rubbish

  i could see their faces now sneer-
ing as i told them the man had killed
himself ugly faces they were
policemens faces-like that of the
motorcycle officer that stopped me to-
night

  that motorcycle officer i stopped
dead in my tracks my hand on the
door

  that motorcycle officer would
know he saw me come in he saw
rocusek was alive then and he had
my card

  my mind was like a whirlwind
what way could i turn how could
i escape wherever i went they
would track me down put me in jail

  hide the body

  that was the thing hide it where
it would never be found burn it
throw it down a well bury it

  no one would know what had hap-
pened to him no one would know he
was dead no one would ever accuse
me

  i looked out the window it was
dark yet i could carry the body
out the back way then drive around
and pick it up

  take it far away bury it in some
lonely spot somewhere no one ever
went that was the thing

  i wasted no time i threw his
heavy body onto my shoulder the
waxy face falling limply against my
back i stumbled with it through
the hallway out through the kitchen
onto the porch

  i dropped it in the shadows then
went through the house and got in
the car

  in a few minutes i was speeding
out the country road as fast as the
car would go the body huddled in
the back

  as we raced through the night my
foot crowding the accelerator against
the floor-boards my mind was work-
ing furiously

  where was the loneliest place in
the countryside where was there
some spot of land no one would ever
visit 

  bridges point

  the scene flashed into my mind
ideal a jungle of undergrowth of
swampy land shoving its long neck
far away from the road to make a
bend in the river

  my heart leaped as the picture
came to my mind no one ever went
there it was ugly damp weedy
no picnic parties would stumble
across the bones

at the next turn i swung the car
south on the road to bridges
point give me a half-hour more and
i would be free of that clammy body
huddled up there in the back

  i felt like sinking for joy

  somebody spoke

  would you mind putting me back
on the seat my arms are a bit
cramped  

  chills raced through my body the
car leaped to the side of the road
almost turned over before my foot
could find the brake

  i turned my head there in the
seat beside me sat rocusek

  i was paralyzed by fear i thought
the man had come to life risen from
the dead

  i looked into the back seat

  there on the floor was rocusek-
his body-the man i had seen die

  i looked again at the man beside
me the same both were dr
rocusek

  terror froze my throat i could
not speak the man beside me
sneered laughed wickedly

  you wonder how i got here did
you forget it was an experiment 
that i am not dead


weird tales

  i was silent i tried to speak the
words would not come

  i can cross the world in the flash
of an eye he laughed while
you sat there in my house watching
my body i was at the telephone call-
ing police i told them who i was
told them you had given me poison
that i was dying

trap like an innocent babe for
months i had planned this revenge

ning all my patients away from me

roads for miles around ive been
watching them flying from one road
to another on their heels

  you cant escape them theyll

  he broke off in a laugh a sneer-
ing mocking laugh

  for a moment i was silent stupe-
fied then rage filled my heart gave
me strength

 you fiend i veiled you

  his grin mocked me

  theyll find me will they i
screamed in frenzy theyll find

ing to do with it  ill tell you im
going to bury it dig a grave by the
river bottoms throw your damned
body into it cover it with sticky
swamp clay smooth it over the top
spread branches and twigs on it hide
it forever and let it rot

  in the moonlight i saw the smile
leave that evil face i saw the skin
go white i knew i had thrown fear
into that-that mind

  this touch of victory turned my
head i almost laughed in his face
as i yelled then you can squirm

and fight try to get out of that
sticky grave

  i laughed loudly hysterically a
long rest youll have your mind
running around like a lost sheep

  rocusek-the spirit-g r i n n e d
again

  you forget he said i can
talk to police as well as to you i
can tell them where my body is bur-
ied they can find it-find it dead  

 you fool i shrieked with
laughter poor fool how can a
murdered man walk into the police
station tell them hes dead theyd
roar at you call you crazy

  i laughed loudly crazily

  the man beside me was silent
slumped back in his seat

  i threw the car into gear began
driving furiously toward the river

  when rocusek spoke again his
voice shook but he laughed nervous
afraid

  well i guess the joke has gone
far enough doctor he said

  joke i didnt understand

  why of course he answered
laughing more loudly now of
course it was a joke just a joke
when i saw how perfectly the experi-
ment worked i couldnt resist the
temptation to play a joke on you 

  a joke eh it was my turn
to sneer now was it a joke to set
police on my trail   

  my laugh rose high above the wind
that whistled past us

  the jokes on you dr rocusek
i roared heres the end of the
road see if you can play any jokes
under six feet of clay

  i roared at my own wit

  i stopped the car at the side of the
road turned off the lights

  in the tool-box i found a tiny
spade one that had helped me out
of many a mudhole

 for gods sake doctor
screamed rocusek you arent seri-
ous  

  youll soon see
out of the grave



  i opened the tonneau door pulled
the body onto my shoulder even
then i wondered why it wasnt stiff
it was cold and clammy but rigor
mortis had not set in that was the
only sign that life remained

  i dragged it out of the car there
was a cry of pain

  look out youre twisting my
arm   screamed the man-the mind
-that stood beside me

  i dropped the arm of the body
and the man beside me sighed in re-
lief

  i still feel everything moaned
the mind the spirit of dr rocusek

  i set off briskly through the
tangled underbrush

  for gods sake doctor he
groaned it was a joke i tell you
a joke

  i laughed madly insanely it was
my turn now

  for a quarter-mile i struggled
through twisting thorny bushes
stumbled over hummocks of grass
ran against tree branches

  unceasingly the spirit-man at my
side pleaded prayed for mercy
from time to time he cried out in
pain as a thorn or a branch tore the
skin of the body that i carried over
my shoulder

  you cant understand doctor
he moaned im as alive as you
are i feel every pain that body
feels but this part of me-my mind
-has no body i can not fight with
you touch you have mercy lay
my body here in the swamps when
the poison leaves i can enter it
again

  and let the police find it hang
me for it i yelled savagely not
much

  now i could see the river ahead
glistening in the moonlight soon we
were near its banks here was the
spot

  i dumped the body to the ground
the spirit-man groaned with pain

iset to work digging the grave
the clay was soft and spongy it
was no work at all to dig in it

  the spirit-man raved with fear
watched every spadeful i threw out

  no words can tell the anguish that
was in his voice as he pleaded for
mercy promised me anything every-
thing if i would only leave that body
on the river bank in the open air

  his pleadings maddened me made
me work the harder i think i was
partly insane as i dug that grave

  at last it was finished i picked
up the body threw it heavily into the
shallow pit

  the spirit screamed

 my arm youve broken my
arm  

  the spirit was on its knees now
wringing its hands begging for life

  i laughed threw a huge spadeful
of the sticky clay on that ghastly
pallid face

  rocusek groaned piteously

    kill me doctor crush my head
with that spade but dont bury
me

  i threw another spadeful into the
grave

  kill me doctor kill me out-
right dont torture me

  another spadeful

 ugh for gods sake for
gods sake im choking the clay
is in my mouth ugh its in my
throat mercy pity  

  another spadeful

  give me a minute to live one
minute for gods sake the drug
is leaving me its leaving im go-
ing to be myself again  

  i looked at the spirit-man kneeling
beside that grave wringing his
hands trying to wrap his spirit arms
about my legs

  he seemed mistier hazier even
before my eyes he seemed to be dis-
solving

  frantically i plunged my spade
into the clay threw spadeful after
spadeful into that shallow grave


weird tales

 one minute one minute
screamed the shade

  it was almost gone now i could
hardly see the mans outlines

  more clay i heaped it into the
grave with frantic haste

  what was that the earth in that
grave seemed to move i threw more
dirt in working like a madman

  the loose clay heaved i jumped
back

  out of the loose earth out of the
shallow grave rose rocusek

  his face was contorted with
anguish and rage he snorted blew
the dirt from his nose spat it out of
his mouth his left arm the broken
one hung limp at his side

  i swung the spade at that swarthy
head i missed

  he leaped onto the firm ground
grabbed at the spade with his one
good hand

 he threw his body on mine
crushed me to the earth we
wrestled struggling for the spade
my grip loosened

  his fist crashed into my face
something-the spade-almost shat-
tered my skull darkness came flood-
ing across my eyes and i knew no
more

it was hours later-broad daylight
-when i came to my senses my
head seemed to be split wide open

  i raised my hand to my head
when i brought it away it was cov-
ered with sticky clotted blood and
clay

  i tried to recall what had hap-
pened i remembered digging the
grave thi-owing that body in it see-
ing it rise up to fight me

  what a nightmare what a hor-
rible nightmare

  but-there was the grave in the
soft clay were the marks of rocuseks
heavy blunt-toed shoes

  my head throbbed i had not got
that in a dream

  i struggled to my feet looked
about for rocusek or his body
nothing in sight

  my head throbbing like a trip-ham-
mer i staggered the quarter-mile
back to the road there was my car
apparently he had been afraid to
take it

  wearily racked by pain and hor-
ror i drove back to town all day
i remained at home nursing my
swollen head

  that evening the door-bell rang
and i answered it

  it was dr rocusek

  ive come to thank you for your
medical assistance last night he
said smiling weve been enemies
too long i want to sign a truce  

  he held out his hand

  it was his left hand his right
hand was in a sling
pierre godard was a
french canadian by descent
whose grandfather had de-
parted the purlieus of montreal for
the good of his miserable hide in the
days of riels rebellion and settled
in that indefinite area of scanty-
soiled farmland along the western
shore of lake champlain between
keeseville and plattsburg

  the degenerate stock of the god-
ards long impoverished since the
era of its plebeian origins in france
did not recover in the descendants
of the original fugitive pierre the
grandson combined in his make-up
the native cussedness of the lower
class canuck with the skinflint
qualities which his lifelong residence
among the narrow-minded yokels
with whom he consorted had readily
imparted shiftless furtive mean-
souled he eked out an existence on
his few barren acres of poor land

which was endurable only because
there was neither in his heredity nor
his experience any better standard
by which he could realize to the full
the utter meanness of everything
that conspired to make up his lifes
record

  at nineteen pierre had married
katie burton a flat-chested sallow-
faced slattern of his own age at
the end of five years of sordid mar-
ried life four brats of their beget-
ting littered up the dirty kitchen of
pierres cabin through the long
cold days of the northern new york
winter and spent their summers
rolling about in the dirt at the road-
side and making faces at the occu-
pants of the automobiles which
passed in a wavering irregular
string all day and most of the early
evening along the state road be-
tween keeseville and plattsburg

                                   


weird tales

  that is there were four brats-
and kathleen to what ancestor of
pierre or katie kathleen could have
been a throw-back is one of
those obscure ethnic mysteries
which are so baffling when they
emerge in the families of recognized
people in kathleens case it baffled
no one since there was no one in
particular to remark this fairy
among the ugly gnomes who pre-
tended to be her brothers and sis-
ters this glorious little swan among
the rough ducklings of the godard
brood

  kathleen had always been utterly
different from the rest by the time
she was six or seven her positive
characteristics were already strong-
ly developed she stood out from
the rest of her sordid family like a
new-minted gold coin among pocket-
worn pennies by natural choice
and habitually she was dainty and
neat dirt never stuck to her some-
how the rest of the brood were
different from each other only in
the varying ugliness of their budding
dispositions and the equally variant
qualities of their general detesta-
bility of appearance and habit all
the rest for example would fight at
the drop of the hat to gain posses-
sion of anything that turned up un-
appropriated that even vaguely
suggested value to their joint scru-
tiny in these snarling contests
kathleen coolly aloof was uninter-
ested the rest possessed in com-
mon that coarse scrubby hair of in-
determinate color which character-
izes the children of outdoor-living
peasants the world over kathleens
a shimmering glory of delicate ring-
lets shone burnished copper in the
afternoon sun when she swept off
the rickety back porch or daintily
threw a few grains of hard corn to
pierres scraggly hens

  at sixteen she was as coolly aloof
from the blandishments of the
coarse young men of her neighbor-

hood as ever she had been to the
scrambling bickerings of her family
all such advances left her wholly
uninterested what dreams and as-
pirations lay behind those clear blue
eyes those eyes like the blue of the
caribbean at noon no one had ever
guessed that is no one except the
good priest father tracy who came
over from one of the neighboring
towns for mass every sunday morn-
ing and on alternate saturday
nights and before first fridays to
hear the confessions of this outlying
portion of his difficult flock to
father tracy it had been for some
time clear that the lovely body of
the little kathleen harbored one of
those rare souls delicate and fra-
grant which burn with the desire to
offer themselves wholly to the love
of god here the good father knew
or strongly suspected was a bud-
ding vocation for the religious life
a vocation which it was one of his
rewards to cultivate and foster

  as yet kathleen was too young
to leave her home even if that had
been feasible and enter upon a novi-
tiate with the good sisters at platts-
burg or perhaps better still in her
case with some other good sisters
much farther away from the place
of her sordid origins but for this
vocation as he watched it grow at
first weak and trembling up toward
the dim light of a possible fulfil-
ment then later with a kind of thin
but pure and steady flame father
tracy said many novenas of thanks-
giving it was one of his chief
sources of happiness and as was
natural in such cases kathleen re-
sponded to his interest in her and
through his gentle kindly leading
of her soul was beginning as she
fulfilled her maturity to see the dis-
tant light more and more clearly

  this vision she cherished with all
her heart and if it begot in her an
almost perceptible wistfulness it
did nothing to minimize the cheerful
the left eye



kindliness with which she went
about the performance of her daily
tasks or the cultivated discretion
with which she had laboriously
learned to meet and neutralize the
changeable moods of her vicious
father and slatternly loose-minded
mother

phe wind-swept habitation for
-i god which she had made of her
pure little heart was rudely battered
on a certain thursday morning in
the month of august in her seven-
teenth year

  pierre her father who combined
with the shiftless existence of a
small peasant-farmer the more ad-
venturous and profitable avocation
of a bootleggers runner for a
plattsburg operator was frequently
away from home at night and even
for days at a time when he was en-
gaged in doing his part in bringing
consignments of illicit merchandise
down from unknown points in near-
by canada either overland along
the state road or by devious and
rutted byways or what was an
easier though somewhat less direct
method much favored by the pro-
fession up the lake on dark
nights a process which was more
lucrative because there were less
people to bribe and correspondingly
somewhat more dangerous as re-
quiring a landing on the shores of
vermont across the lake or some-
where on the new york side

  he had been away on one of these
expeditions for two days and had
returned sometime during the small
hours wednesday night on that
thursday morning after two nearly
sleepless nights unkempt ugly as a
bear with a sore nose he pushed his
way into the kitchen about  oclock
and demanded something to eat

  kathleen brought him his food
and he ate in a brooding silence
she waited sitting on the step be-
low the open doorway for him to

finish so that she might wash his
dishes and tidy up the table after
him softly humming a tuneless lit-
tle song her mind entirely other-
worldly

  pierre having finished his break-
fast came straight to the point of a
certain matter which he had been
cogitating for several weeks

  come here he said

  she rose and came to the table ex-
pecting that he required another
cup of coffee or something of the
sort

  shut the door barked her fa-
ther

  she closed the door leading into
the small hallway out of the kitchen
wonderingly and returned to her fa-
thers side

  how old are you he asked
looking at her as though he were ap-
praising her

  seventeen

  seventeen eh his eyes went
over her again in such fashion that
without knowing why she felt sud-
denly choked

  ah seventeen old enough now
listen that is old enough you are
going to marry steve benham i got
that all fixed see me an him we
talk about it a lot and steve is all
right for it

  the choking feeling nearly over-
came her the blood seemed to suf-
fuse her wrhole body and then recode
somewhere leaving her icy cold and
afraid marriage had never entered
kathleens mind and steve ben-
ham  benham was a brutal-faced
young tough who with greater ad-
arantages such as are offered to the
denizens of great cities in their
worst aspects might have shone as
a criminal of the lower type - a
yegg a killer for hire the ready and
effective tool of some brutal organ-
ized gang as it was he had taken
advantage of such opportunities as
presented themselves to his some-
what restricted field of develop-


weird tales

ment he was one of levines
crowd in the bootlegging operations
a close associate of pierre godards

  what the hells the matter with
you now roared pierre curbing
his voice slightly in view of his de-
sire for secrecy this was his look-
out and none of katies business
he could handle his own girl all by
himself without his wifes having any
part in it benham had offered him
two hundred dollars to put it
through for him and that two hun-
dred he meant to have-as soon as
possible too

 steves all right aint he
whats the matter with steve now
cut out this blubberin kathleens
lips were trembling in a colorless
face her eyes big and bright with
the tears she was forcing to remain
unshed she knew the resources of
this brute of a father which an in-
scrutably unkind providence had
inflicted upon her

 pierre his anger mounting by
leaps and bounds glared at her his
ugly face rendered hideous by a sav-
age snarl his clenched hand show-
ing white at the knuckles as he
gripped the tables edge

  o daddy i cant i cant

  kathleens restraint had broken
down under this unexpected and
crushing blow she sank down in a
chair at the side of the table and
buried her lovely head in her hands
her body shaken with convulsive
sobs

  this weakening aroused all the
half-latent brute in godard with a
savage curse he seized kathleen by
the hair dragging her face up from
the table and with the back of the
other hand dealt her several cruel
and heavy blows

  she sank as she shrank away to
the floor a shuddering heap of mis-
ery and pain

  pierre rose his anger partially al-
layed and looked down at her he
kicked her but lightly in the side

  get up out of that an get to
hell out of here and clean yourself
up steves cornin in about noon
an im goin to tell him its all set
for him dont you dast do nothin
to spoil it neither you hear now
git up an beat it along an get your-
self prettied up  

  he seized her roughly by the
shoulder dragged her to her feet
and shoved her through the door into
the hallway

  upstairs in her tiny little room
he lay across the bed bruised and
shaken trying to collect her wits
one refuge and one only occurred to
her for even under the stress of this
unexpected manifestation of her fa-
thers known brutality she had no
idea of giving in to his demand and
receiving steve benham as a suitor

  trembling shaken in every fiber
of her delicate body but with her
almost unformulated resolve burn-
ing within her like a bright strong
flame she dragged herself resolute-
ly to her feet and began painfully
to change her clothes she had de-
cided to go to father tracy for pro-
tection

  an hour later very softly she
crept downstairs it was past 
oclock and she would have to man-
age to elude her mother her bro-
thers and sister had not been about
the house she remembered since
their breakfast time her mother
would be below she had been out in
the chicken-yard when her father had
come into the kitchen for his break-
fast he had gone out immediately
after she had come upstairs prob-
ably to report progress to benham
she shuddered and crept down the
stairs like a mouse

  she could hear her mother aim-
lessly pottering about in the kitchen
she slipped out of the seldom-used
front door and out to the gate and
along the road as she turned the
first corner she met her sister

eunice walking beside one of the
town boys

  where you goin all dressed
up enquired eunice her pert face
alive with interest in this unexpect-
ed apparition of kathleen in her
best dress and sunday hat kathleen
bit her lip this was a wholly un-
expected an entirely unavoidable
misfortune she was utterly unused
to deceit the truth was her only
resource

    i have to go over to villanova to
see father tracy she replied sim-
ply eunices eyes opened wide in
astonishment she said nothing and
kathleen walking as rapidly as she
could passed the couple and con-
tinued on her way

  it was not until noon that eunice
arrived home and kathleen with two
hours start could not be overtaken

odard on hearing of his daugh-
ters destination was for the
time being nonplussed he would
have to think this over it was a
wholly unexpected move on kath-
leens part cursing her in his black
heart he betook himself accompanied
by a fresh bottle of levines commod-
ity to the barn and spent the after-
noon in consultation with the bottle

  about  oclock having had a
brief nap and awaking in an ug-
lier mood than ever he came back
to the house for another bottle and
with that he disappeared until dark
he did not come into the house for
his supper and to the summons of
his son ernest he replied only with
such fervent curses that ernest
edified returned to the house to
warn the rest of the family to leave
the old man alone

  about  oclock alone he set out
in his ford car the family heard
him go but this meant nothing to
them they were used to his blind
rages and to his goings and comings
at all hours

  exercising that kind of low cun-

ning which he had inherited from
his disreputable ancestors and which
had served him well in his many
evasions of the officers of the law
of the state of new york he did not
drive through the neighboring small
village where kathleen had met her
sister walking but took a devious
way through obscure mountain roads
to villanova the larger town which
lay several miles inland from the
lake shore and where father tracy
lived

  he left his ford several rods up a
wood road at the foot of a mountain
near the edge of the town and
threaded his way through the more
obscure streets in the direction of
the rectory

  very few people were abroad but
when he arrived at the edge of the
back-yard of the parochial residence
he observed with a certain satisfac-
tion that the house was lighted in
what he supposed to be the pastors
study on the first floor

 he had brought the automatic
pistol which always accompanied his
professional journeys over the cana-
dian border but his ride in the pure
adirondack night air and the neces-
sity for concentration in driving
over the rough mountain roads had
dissipated the effects of the two bot-
tles of cut whisky which he had
consumed to that degree that as he
approached the house with murder
in his black heart he did so with all
the native cunning he possessed keyed
to the last notch and indeed in
a state of almost preternatural cau-
tion but within him unleashed
burned the evil fires of rage disap-
pointment and hatred against his
daughter and this good priest which
had seared and hardened his evil
soul to the point where he would
stop at nothing

  under the stress of this stimula-
tion he decided suddenly not to use
the pistol and he looked about the
yard for a suitable weapon the


weird tales

devil placed one to his hand there
near the back porch lay an ideal
club a section of thin gas-pipe left
that very day by the local plumber
who had fitted a new section to the
hand-pump which supplied the kit-
chen he picked up the pipe which
was about two feet in length and
balanced it in his hand a devilish
grin contorting his bleared features

  very softly he approached the
house on the side which lay in
shadow and took his stand under
the lighted study window cautious-
ly he raised himself to a level with
the lower edge of the window and
peered through the transverse aper-
ture left by an imperfectly pulled-
down shade

  kathleen sat with her back to him
within two feet of the open window
on the other side of the table sat the
priest kathleen was speaking he
craned his neck to listen his teeth
now unconsciously bared

  i think it would be better for me
to go to the convent out there in the
west father she was saying for
as you say the farther away i go the
safer i would feel

  the priest made some reply of ac-
quiescence and approval unintelligi-
ble to godard who was now busily
engaged in removing with the deli-
cate touch of a repairer of watches
the fasteners from the wire screen
which separated him from his prey

  it came out in his hands without
a sound and before the priest had
finished his remark godard was in
the room cursing frenziedly though
still softly for he was still under the
influence of his cautious obsession
he sprang like a tiger through the
window and with one terrific blow
had crushed his daughters lovely
head like an eggshell

  father tracy overcome with hor-
ror and momentarily helpless in the
face of this berserk attack out of the
calm mediocrity of his side-yard
was the next victim with unspeak-

able blasphemies on his crusted lips
foam in the corners of his mouth
godard was upon him and the iron
bar fell again and again until all
human semblance was gone and a
heap of huddled pulp on the rapidly
crimsoning floor of his quiet study
was all that remained mortal of the
kindly priest of god

  then shivering under the fearful
reaction of his holocaust godard
exercising the last remaining power
of the stimulation of his low cun-
ning blew out the lamp and as si-
lently as a shadow slipped out
through the opened window onto the
grass beneath

he turned back along the shadow
of the houpe but before he had
reached the open yard behind he be-
thought him abruptly of the detached
wire screen which he had left lean-
ing against the side of the house
he returned catlike and busied
himself with refastening it just as
he snicked home the last of the four
patent fasteners footsteps ap-
proached along the sidewalk from the
farther side of the house and he
crouched like an animal against the
side of the house in deep protecting
shadow the footsteps accompanied
by two unconstrained voices -and
punctuated by raucous laughs con-
tinued past the house godard held
his breath until it seemed to burn
within his breast and furtively cat-
like watched with unwinking small
eyes the two uncertainly-outlined
figures pass the house at last they
were gone and noiselessly he slipped
again along the side of the house
in the protecting shadow and disap-
peared in the tangle of weeds at the
end of the yard

  again by back streets he thread-
ed his way tortuously toward the
mountain road where he had con-
cealed his car as he stepped cau-
tiously out onto the main road which
led into the village of villanova he
the left eye



almost ran into two large men who
were standing smoking silently at
the roadside involuntarily he
stopped and the two turned toward
him a blinding flash dazzled his eyes
as one of the men turned the gleam of
an electric flashlight in the direction
of the furtive shape which had brok-
en in upon their meditation at once
godard was recognized

  it was the two men who had passed
the rectory while he was replac-
ing the wire screen in the window
both hailed him by name

  what you a-doin way out here
this time o night pierre came the
full bass of martin delaney

   goshamighty thought you was
a ghost or somepn it was the
squeaky voice of louis le grand

  shaking in abject terror the stim-
ulation of his blood-lust entirely
dissipated and no longer supporting
him pierre godard could only
stand his knees shaking and knock-
ing and goggle back at his inter-
locutors at last after the passage
of several moments and a new look
one of curiosity had implanted itself
on the faces of the two countrymen
godard managed to gasp in a dry
throaty voice not at all like his own
something about a piece of business
here in villanova and not waiting
to ascertain what effect his unusual
preoccupation might have upon de-
laney and le grand he hastened at
a kind of shambling trot down the
main road toward his hidden car

  both delaney and le grand were
very much mystified at godards
unusual behavior the two cronies
commonly bereft of all but the usual
topics of local conversation which
were anything but interesting made
the most of this mild mystery there-
fore it was very firmly implanted in
their rather obtuse minds that there
could be only one possible author of
the horrible crime which had been
committed in the rectory when the

little town buzzed and seethed with
it the next morning

  by  oclock of that friday a
posse was out after godard under
the direction of a deputy sheriff and
equipped with three automobiles
and had traced him as far as wills-
boro point by an imperfection in one
of his tires when the search was
abruptly terminated by finding the
car itself which he had abandoned
at the side of the point road at the
intersection of another road which
led down to the shore of the lake it
did not require more than the very
average intelligence of deputy sher-
iff maelear to come to the obvious
conclusion that he had got across
the lake and into vermont a con-
clusion corroborated by the state-
ment of an irate resident camper
who had been searching during the
past hour and a half for a missing
st lawrence skiff in which the
camper had planned to go perch-fish-
ing that morning and which could

nowhere be discovered

 t

  the posse drove back to willsboro
station and notified the vermont
authorities at burlington by tele-
graph then deputy sheriff maelear
reported to his superior who got in
touch with albany asking requisi-
tion papers on the governor of the
state of vermont for a fugitive who
had the night before brutally mur-
dered his own daughter and a blame-
less priest of god

  but the vermont authorities al-
though they took due action upon
the telegraphed information which
contained an exact description of
godard failed signally to get on the
track of the fugitive from justice
who had left the new york shore
unmistakably from willsboro point
every usual precaution was taken
and for some time it was surmised
that godard familiar with the lake
shores from a lifetime of contiguous
residence and from his professional
activities as a rum-runner had man-


weird tales

aged to land on the vermont side
and make his escape into the moun-
tains the greatest puzzle was what
could have become of that st
lawrence skiff which he had dis-
covered so opportunely

  some of the clearer-headed of
those who set themselves to solve
this problem came to the conclusion
that godard desiring to conceal
from his pursuers the point of his
departure inland in vermont had
scuttled the boat near the shores
edge which he could easily have
managed either by smashing a hole
or two after landing weighting
down the skiff with rocks and shov-
ing her out into the deep waters of
the lake or by doing the scuttling be-
fore landing and swimming ashore
at any rate there was on the ver-
mont side no trace either of the
fugitive or of the delicate little ves-
sel in which he had left the new
york side

as godard sped away from the
vicinity of villanova it required
from him every particle of concen-
tration he could summon to drive
at all he opened up his dingy little
car which had despite its battered
appearance an excellent engine and
hitting the high spots of the twin-
ing rough mountain roads he con-
centrated every effort in the blind
urge to put as many miles as pos-
sible between himself and the scene
of his horrible crime

  it was only when after several
miles of incredible bumping and
swaying he had reached a state
road that a definite objective for
his flight began to take form in his
harassed and befuddled mind as
he gave fragmentary thought to this
pressing problem something of his
native low-cunning reasserted itself
his evil mind began to function it
first became plain to him that he
could not return to his squalid home
he had been seen and recognized

his one hope was that the crushed
and mangled bodies of his unfortu-
nate victims might not be discovered
until morning

  there was no good reason why
they should be discovered the
priest as he knew very well lived
alone except for a superannuated
old woman who was his housekeeper
and this ancient crone had unques-
tionably retired for the night long
before his arrival in villanova be-
ing ancient and decrepit she could
be trusted to sleep through every-
thing until morning barring a
night-call for father tracy the
chances were excellent that the bod-
ies would not be discovered until
sometime the next morning it was
now a little after midnight it
would be light around  o clock he
had something like four hours to
work in

  he speeded up the car along the
lake shore southward he would go
up the lake - as the southerly
direction for some inexplicable rea-
son was called locally - away
from canada canada had been
his first lucid thought but that as
he reasoned cunningly would neces-
sitate a wide detour or else passing
through ilattsburg and he wished
to risk neither the loss of time nor
the dash through a good-sized city
even at  oclock in the morning
therefore he turned south in the
direction of essex

  as he neared willsboro the town
just north of essex a brand-new
idea occurred to him by abandon-
ing his car somewhere hereabouts
he could get an earlier start for cross-
ing the lake into vermont with
every mile he traveled the lake nar-
rowed but straight across from
willsboro it would be only four
miles and he reasoned he would
rather be out on the lake in the dim
dusk of early morning than attempt-
ing to conceal his car and steal a boat
in anything approaching daylight
the left eye



some early-morning fisherman would
be sure to see him

  a little past the willsboro railroad
station therefore his idea having be-
gotten another in his cunning brain
this time something in the nature of
an inspiration he turned his car
sharply to the left grinning evilly as
he acted upon his newest hunch and
ran back nearly at right angles with
his previous course down upon
willsboro point this is a peninsula
several miles in length running
northeasterly-a section of fine farm-
land in the center its two shores
thickly populated by summer camp-
ers city people for the most part no
one pursuing would ever imagine
that he had turned off he reasoned
besides the city people at the camps
had canoes and in a canoe from
somewhere near the points end he
could with the greatest ease make
his unseen way out to one of the
four brother islands conceal the
canoe in some dense thicket of under-
brush and effectually hide out there
were too lake-gulls  eggs in abun-
dance on the islands and no one
would suspect until it was too late
that he had done otherwise than at-
tempt to make his escape either into
canada his own first idea or across
the lake into vermont

  the car was his immediate prob-
lem but there was no way of solving
that there was as he well knew no
water along the shore deep enough
to permit his sending it at full speed
over the edge into the lake and so
hiding it effectually

  he left it directly in the road and
slunk down to the lake shore at his
right in search of a canoe

  his luck held at the very first
camp he reached he found not only
canoes but a st lawrence skiff a
staunch type of boat round-bot-
tomed sharp-nosed at both ends a
boat capable like a canoe of being
managed with a light paddle but al-
though equally fast infinitely

stauncher and less dangerous than
any canoe

  silently he launched out into the
lake and with swift yet noiseless
paddle-strokes shot his stolen skiff
out into the black darkness in the
direction of the four brothers

  these islands lcs isles des quatre
vents of the voyageurs are old
haunts of the lake smugglers they
lie from the viewpoint of one ap-
proaching them directly from the
point shore in the order of a mouth
nose and two eyes roughly speaking
the nearest called the mouth was
sighted after a few minutes of vigor-
ous paddling by godard who passed
it to the right or southerly direction
it had upon it a cabin former resi-
dence of the keeper of the gulls
which are protected by state law
godard was not looking for the com-
forts of cabins he passed the
nose a low-lying swampy island
and paddled on to the island which
would correspond to the left eye
this the most rarely visited of the
islands infested with gulls presents
like its fellow eye a precipitous
shore all around and is heavily for-
ested with evergreens and thick vir-
gin underbrush

guided precisely by the noise of
the gulls which are constantly
bickering and then by his own keen
eyesight godard carefully navigated
the little island finally landing and
drawing the skiff into a tiny bay
which was little more than a cleft in
the guano-covered rocks he con-
cealed the skiff despite the darkness
with immense cleverness and began
the difficult ascent of the cliff

  at last bruised spent and be-
fouled with guano he reached the
summit and half walked half
crawled through the tangled under-
brush toward the almost impene-
trable center

  in his ascent he had disturbed
countless nesting gulls and their din

to his strained and tautened nerves
was distracting but the increased
noise did not trouble him the gulls
were always at it day and night and
such an increase would not be heard
a mile and a half away on the sleep-
ing point it was curiously enough
the spider webs that really annoyed
him undisturbed for centuries
these midnight spinners had worked
and spun and plundered the air with-
out hindrance

  as godard pushed his precipitous
way up the rocks and then again
through the almost impenetrable un-
derbrush he was constantly brush-
ing away long clinging webs which
crossed and recrossed before his face
and neck and about his scratched
and bleeding hands and wrists

  as he penetrated farther and
farther toward the slightly conical
center of the little island it seemed
to him that both the restraining
pressure and the clinging tenacity of
the webs were on the increase but his
native wit assured him that this im-
pression was due to his fatigue and
the reaction from the enormous
amount of bad whisky he had im-
bibed during the afternoon

  he was indeed in the very depths
of reactive depression he cursed
softly and bitterly with a despairing
note of self-pity as the webs ever
thicker and stronger as it seemed
appeared almost to reach out after
him to bar his way to effectual con-
cealment

  at last trembling in every limb
the salt sweat running into his
parched mouth shaking and weak
he observed that he was stepping
slightly downhill his progress since
leaving the upper edge of the cliff had
been slightly ascending he had
reached the approximate center of
the island

  wearily he paused and almost
sobbing out his bitter curses tore
fretfully with trembling fingers at

a great mass of thick silky web that
had attached itself to his mouth

  as he looked about him through
the darkness and felt with his hands
for a comparatively level place on
which to sit down he almost shrieked
he had put his hand down on some-
thing feathery soft and yielding to
the touch he looked horrified at
the ground gibbering in mortal
terror he drew a box of matches
from his pocket and cupping his
hands cautiously drew one across
the side of the box the flare of the
safety-match revealed something
white he looked closer stooping
near the ground and carefully guard-
ing the flame of his match and he
saw that it was the body of a gull

  something he thought something
that seemed as big as his two fists
scampered away through the under-
brush awkwardly a lumpish kind of
thing a mink or weasel his reason
reassured him

  the match went out burning his
fingers and a pall of sudden black-
ness fell upon him terrified less
moved with the caution of a lifelong
habitude for concealment now he
struck another match and examined
the gull by its yellow flare

  from the birds throat ran two
thin streams of blood the blood
stained his hands as he picked it up
the gull was warm living it
struggled sinuously faintly in his
hands all about it about its head
and about its legs and pinning its
powerful wings close to its side ran
great silken swaths of spiders web
the gull muttered squeakingly and
writhed weakly between his hands
with a scream he could not suppress
he hurled it from him and attempted
to rush away from this place of hor-
ror

  but now weakened by his ex-
ertions his forces sapped by long de-
bauchery his nerves jangling from
the terrific stress he had put upon
them that night he could not run
the left eye



all about him the underbrush closed
in it seemed to him as though bent
malignantly upon imprisoning him
here among these nameless silent
spinning demons which had de-
stroyed the gull

  he had hurled his matches away
with that same flinging motion begot-
ten of his horror it was utterly
impossible to recover them now

  the thick blackness had closed
down upon him again at the burning
out of the second match he could
feel the blood suffuse his entire body
and then recede leaving him cold
he shivered as he suddenly felt the
sweat cold against his sodden body
chill after chill raced down his spine
he whimpered and called suddenly
upon god the forgotten god of his
erratic childhood

  but god it seemed had no answer
for him a soft touch came delicate-
ly upon the back of his clenched
right hand something soft clinging
and silky passed around it sud-
denly he shrieked again and spas-
modically tore his hand loose but
even as he struggled to free his hand
a terrible pain seared his leg a pain
as though he had stepped under
water upon a sting-ray a pain as
though a red-hot poniard had been
thrust far into his calf and then
something soft and clinging fell upon
his head and he could feel the thick
strands of silk being woven remorse-
lessly through his hair and about his
ears   

  as he sank to the ground his con-
sciousness rapidly waning the first
n g i n g  composite deliberate
strands went across his eyes his last
conscious thought was of his daugh-
ter kathleens soft silky hair   

it was not until nearly two weeks
later that the skiff came to light
when four large rowboats slowly ap-
proached les isles des quatre vents
from the direction of the lake side of
the base of the point crowded into

the boats were the boys from camp
cherokee making one of their annual
boat-hikes to the four islands their
course naturally brought them first
to the island which has been called
the left eye

  the st lawrence skiff loosened
from its primitive fastenings by a
heavy storm which had intervened
had slipped out several feet from its
concealing underbrush

  oh look somebodys out here
already shouted a sharp-eyed
youngster in the bow of the foremost
rowboat

  cant we land here mr tan-
ner asked one of the older boys
when all eyes had sought out and dis-
covered the skiff we have plenty
of time nobody ever comes to this
island they say and most of us saw
the others last year

  consulting his watch his mind on
lunch ashore the counselor in charge
of the boat-hike gave his consent and
the four rowboats drew in close to the
spot where godard had made his
landing mr tanner looked closely
at the skiff

  i shouldnt be a bit surprized
he remarked slowly if that were
the skiff that was stolen from down
on the point a couple of weeks ago  
the boys chattered excitedly while
the boats lay off the shore of the
left eye mr tanner considering
it was not impossible that the mur-
derer godard lay concealed on this
island no one had hitherto thought
of such a possibility

  mr tanner came to a conclusion
after rapid thought he would take
the skiff thus cutting off the mur-
derer if indeed he were concealed on
the island from any probable escape
so far it appeared a clear course

   two reliable older boys placed in
charge of the salvaged skiff returned
it to its owners who promptly tele-
phoned the sheriff

  mr tanner conducted his protest-
ing flotilla across to the island which


weird tales

 has been called the mouth-the
 island on which stood the hut and
 where the boys temporary camp-site
 had been planned the oars moved
 reluctantly for the boys wanted to
 land and hunt the murderer mr
 tanner whose responsibility lay in
 another direction than the apprehen-
 sion of criminals preferred to pro-
 ceed according to schedule

    two hours later a laden rowboat
  put off from the point and ap-
  proached the four brothers the
  watching boys thus as it were aug-
  mented by the authorities could be
  restrained no longer

    mr tanner was able to manage it
  so that his four rowboats followed
  the official rowboat to the left
  eye beyond that he could not
  control his indians

   the boys nearly swamped their
boats in their eagerness to disem-
 bark   

    in the end it was one of them who

  did	actually discover godards re-
  mains

    gosh the rest heard him shout
  look here everybody heres a
  thing like a mummy  

    the spot was soon surrounded the
  more agile boys distancing the slow-
  er-moving sheriff and constables

    godards body easily identifiable
  from its clothing lay or more pre-
  cisely hung in the thickest tangle of
  all the tangled bushes and brush
  which made the central highest point
  of the little island almost impene-
  trable at first sight it gave the im-
  pression of a bundle of clothes rather
  than a human body it was as the
  boy had cried out virtually a mum-
  my though sodden through the
  draggled clothes which godards
  progress through the tearing brash
  had greatly disarranged by the ef-
  fects of the heavy storm which had
  revealed the skiff

    it gave the appearance of a human
  body which as though by some long
  process of time had dried up to a

mere fraction of its original bulk it
swayed held free of the ground by
the heavy brush in the brisk breeze
which was blowing up the lake
from the cold north

  the grayish appearance of this
strange simulacrum of a human form
which at first puzzled the men when
they approached to disengage it
from the tangled bushes was found
to be due to innumerable heavy
strands of broad opalescent silky
webbing webbing which had been
wound about the head about the
hands and arms and legs webbing
now frayed and torn in places by the
wind and the friction of the bushes

  one of the constables a heavy
rather brutal-faced person pulled
at it and rubbed it from his hands on
his canvas overalls

  looks for all the world like spi-
der web he remarked laconically
what dyou spose it can be
herb addressing the deputy sher-
iff in charge

  herb maclear the sheriff pushed
his way through the brush close to
the body he too examined the web
touching it gingerly with his finger
and then rubbing his finger as though
something uncanny unwholesome
had touched him the boys sensing
something dreadful fell silent sev-
eral pushed their way toward mr
tanner and stood near him

  maclear pale now stooped and
seemed to be looking at something
near the ground gimme that
stick he ordered one of the con-
stables handed him what he demand-
ed and with it the sheriff poked at
something on the ground their curi-
osity overcoming the general sense
of something queer about the whole
proceeding several of the boys and
two of the constables shouldered
through the brush toward the sheriff
now digging with his stick his face
red again from stooping and his exer-
tions
the left eye



  those standing nearest observed
that the sheriff was enlarging a hole
that ran into the ground near the
heavy root of one of the bushes a hole
about which were heavy warps of the
same gray shimmering web

  the stick broke through a soft spot
and sank far into the enlarged hole

  my god they heard the sheriff
say

  he played delicately with the stick
as though working at something that
the ground obscured he twisted
and worked it about in the hole

  at last he drew it up still care-
fully gingerly

  and on its end transfixed there
came into the light of that morning
a huge frightful maimed thing of
satiny loathsome black like the fur
of a bat with glowing salmon-colored

striping showing upon its hunched
back-a spider as large as a prize
peach with great waving now in-
effective metal-like mandibles they
saw its little burning eyes like harsh
diamonds gleam once before the sher-
iff holding it on the ground with his
stick set his foot on the dreadful
thing

  the wind blew cold from the north
as the men in a tight knot half
dragged half carried the meager body
of pierre godard hastily out through
the retarding brush in silence while
a subdued and silent group of boys
closely gathered about their white-
faced counselor hurried down the
declivity toward the edge of the cliff
below which they could see their
boats floating down there in the clean
water

vulture of vultures rock was

the man who
was damned

 by charlton lawrence edholm

   for instance there is a proverb
that says dead men tell no tales but
it were well to consider whether the proverb
be not a concise summing up of human ig-
norance

gude science and superstition

the last sound my dulling eyes
heard was the twang of that
thin polished steel which had
burned swiftly into my vitals to be
as swiftly withdrawn

  the master of geierstein coolly
wiped the rapier with his silken
scarf while i writhed at his feet and
as i gasped out my life he stood neg-
ligently plucking the blade as one

might finger a guitar and like the
taut string of a guitar it answered
-zing-ng-ng and as its vibrations
slowly passed into silence again zing-
ng-ng-

 all this happened in the dark
woods on his side of the river neck-
ar for in following the stag i had in-
cautiously crossed the boundary that
divided my estate from that of my
familys hereditary foe the race of
geier von geierstein vulture of
vultures rock-and well named

  the encounter took place in a den-
sely shadowed glade and was in
truth little less than assassination


weird

tales

for as i realized when my rapier met
his breast he wore under his fair
white linen he wore above his cruel
craven heart a corselet of tempered
links delicate masterpiece of some
italian armorer and my blade
snapped like glass upon it

  seeing me disarmed he thrust me
through the body swiftly but not in
passion and with a gentle laugh
stood back to watch me die at in-
tervals he carelessly twanged the
lithe steel which gave forth a sharp
note of exultation passing away in
long musical vibrations zing-ng-
ng-

  he hated me with the hatred
nursed through many generations
but it was not the hatred of a great-
hearted foe which defied even in
death ends with death he scorned
me the scorn of his arrogant race
the scorn of a successful rival the
scorn of an ignoble victor the bit-
terness of such scorn is far bitterer
than death it taints the soul even
the soul of the dead

  vulture of vultures rock i
will avenge myself were the last
words of mine he heard and there-
at he laughed softly and shrugged
his shoulders

  perhaps but i think it highly
improbable my good friend he
was secure i left no son and as for
my words he deemed them the im-
potent ravings of a dying man

  what other words i uttered with
my last choking gasps were not
meant for him nor did he hear them
for his own soft ironical laughter
and the twanging of his steel

three days elapsed my body
had been found and carried to
schloss aarberg the two wounds
one in the breast where the rapier
had entered a smaller one in the
back where it had passed out
were washed and the corpse shroud-
ed for burial was laid in the chapel

whose windows overlooked the tower
of geierstein on its cliff across the
neckar

 seven tapers burned about the
bier

  freiherr geier von geierstein lay
in his chamber overhanging the
river and slept but not soundly for
a fever that was in his blood by his
side lay his wife bride of a fortnight
and her placid breathing told of
dreamless sleep

  the windows were open the air
had turned sultry and a black vapor
obscured the heavens not a star
not one serene star shone in the dark
void only a solitary baleful light
hung between earth and sky and
shot its red rays like a burning arrow
into the eyes of the sleeping man
he turned to avoid it he tossed
from side to side he buried his face
in the pillows but with lids open or
closed that sullen-glowing light tor-
tured him like a live coal upon his
eyeballs it was from the chapel
window in castle aarberg illum-
ined with the seven tapers that stood
about my bier

  a faint yet distinct sound as of a
guitar plucked lightly-oh so light-
ly-pierced the silence as the poi-
soned ray pierced the night again it
sounded and again still faint as
dream music a short clear note
then long long-drawn vibrations-
the shadow of a sound

  gradually the sound grew draw-
ing nearer ever nearer now recur-
ring at longer now at shorter inter-
vals now a low murmur now a
sharp sudden twang until to the
strained ear of him who listened the
sound-waves seemed to proceed from
a source within the walls of castle
geierstein which they overfilled
the sound-waves deluged the room
deafening the wretched and fevered
man until he wondered at the peace-
ful breathing of her who slept at his
side
the man who was damned



  he listened scarcely breathing
he tried to convince himself that it
was the blood throbbing in his ears
that it was a meaningless noise not
to be feared he raised his head
from his hot pillow he would as-
sure himself that this was some
natural and commonplace sound
merely that he opened his eyes
the light from schloss aarbergs
death chamber smote them he fell
back upon his restless pillow fear
of he knew not what parched his
throat and turned his vitals to stone

  at last as i had foreseen the
doomed man arose in desperation not
with courage groped in the dark for
his weapon which he unsheathed and
very quietly turned the handle of his
chamber door the sound rang in his
ears it was not loud yet it seemed to
echo down the long stone corridor
cleai metallic insistent

  why must he trace that sound to its
source  a strong pull at the cord by
his bedside would bring servants
running to do his will he could
not he fancied that the clangor of
the brazen alarm in the tense silence
would be more terrifying than to
go on

  he cautiously re-closed the door
quaking he picked his way along the
hall guided by the row of windows
which admitted a pale light from the
courtyard as he stole along the chill
length of the corridor he heard no
sound but his own heart-beats and as
he reached the spiral staircase of the
burgfried the highest tower of geier-
stein he sneered at his own folly in
pursuing the fantasm of a restless
dream

  he would go back he would sleep
off this fever as he turned once
more the sound pealed forth down
the winding stairs and upon his head
as if it would crush him

  a sudden thought flashed light
upon his bewilderment and terror in
the topmost window of the tower his

bride had fitted an seolian harp he
remembered the resonant box with its
taut strings that answered to the
lightest wind in the tower a mouse
scratching on the wood or gnawing
one of the strings had produced the
strange noises a mouse a timid
foolish creature frightened at a foot-
fall had struck with terror the heart
of the master of geierstein he
laughed aloud in his relief and the
spiral tunnel caught up his laughter
and answered but with an intonation
so diabolical that he abruptly ceased

  he was breathless too from the
quick ascent and a little giddy from
following the stairs around their cen-
tral shaft and so he climbed more
slowly counting the windows or ar-
row-slits as he passed them of these
narrow apertures there were four to
each round of the spiral looking to
the four points of the compass and
always as he passed three of these the
light came pale and there was silence
but as he passed the fourth which
faced castle aarberg the light was
red and the sound fell upon his ears
each time louder and more compell-
ing

  sometimes he responded with an
impatient oath at the last spiral
though with a laugh of relief and
as he sprang up the remaining few
steps to the circular room under the
roof his eyes searching for the seolian
harp-met mine

  my eyes as he had seen them last
my form as he had known it in life
my rapier as it had vainly searched
for his heart but it was unbroken
now and on the long gleaming needle
the red light from the window ran
back and forth like blood transmuted
to quicksilver he recoiled a step i
smiled the smile with whih one
spurns a coward

  uttering a fierce outcry like a mad-
dened animal he flung himself at me
aiming at my heart the same thrust
that had served him so well-once


weird tales

 i did not guard his rapier
snapped in his hand like glass against
my breast

 my own weapon but touched his
body his impetus served me better
than my force the polished steel
slid through appearing like a flash of
light behind him

  as he dropped i carefully wiped
the blade with a silken scarf on
which as i took pains to show him
were dark brown stains

  while he lay writhing i twanged
but once on the weapon it gave forth
the sound so like the vibrations of a
guitar sharply touched the sound
that had drawn him from the side of
his sleeping bride

  he was long a-dying the first
fiery serpent tongue of a midsummer
storm darted from the cloud-laden
west he was long a-dying the
tempest burst overhead while i stood
watching him

  before the last spark of intelli-
gence was dimmed i bent over him
and whispered in his ear that he
might hear me distinctly through the
roar of the elements geier of geier-
stein think not that death sets you
free there is a bitterness more bit-
ter than death it is mine to requite
you

it was not until two days and two
nights had passed that i allowed
his tortured soul to return for a brief
respite

  they had found his body in the
tower chamber that same night a
bum on his breast a smaller one on
his back and his shattered rapier on
the floor told a clear story to the
physician the storm that had shaken
the mighty castle of geierstein had
felled its lord with a thunderbolt so
it was interpreted by all

  he lay in his bridal chamber two
days and two nights and all the time
she whom i loved was bending over
the body that she incessantly strove to

recall to life then i realized the
wealth of love that i had lost and
that he had won and i hated him the
more it was unfairly won for he
was incapable of love he had wooed
as he had lived as he had fought
traitorously vulture of vultures
rock

  he breathed at last he stirred he
opened his eyes and the horror of
their gaze was unutterable he raved
he blasphemed he sought in vain for
words to tell them of the terrors his
soul had undergone in those two days
when i lashed and rode it through the
universe of death

  they could not understand nor be-
lieve when in his terror he entreat-
ed piteously for help from the im-
placable foe who sat so sternly
waiting at his bedside they called
it delirium when finally i again
snatched his wretched soul to myself
they called it death

  only once more did his spirit re-
turn to his body in the tomb but
a few years ago workmen unsealing
his vault with its boastful epitaph
found the leaden casket burst and
open almost wide enough for the
quick-interred to escape by the pos-
ture of the skeleton one could see that
his struggles must have been super-
human

  the memorial tablet that covers my
own poor bones tells in sonorous
latin that i was a good churchman
a very soldier of the faith no tomb-
stone flattery that it is true in
life my soul was my very dearest
treasure next to my sacred honor
and i ardently prayed for its salva-
tion still i think you will agree
with me that i was given a good price
when with my last gasp i bartered my
soul my only remaining possession to
the evil one for-well let us say for
satisfaction

  it was one summer evening a hun-
dred and fifty-odd years ago in the
woods by geierstein
it was death to a white man to see
the god of windina for such sacri-
lege brought calamity on the man-
dingo people

the smoking room of the
travelers club was emptying
rapidly many of the mem-
bers were leaving for the theaters
and others preferred the billiard
room or the library the obsequious
waiters were still hurrying about
carrying coffees black and white
liqueurs and cigars and over the
whole premises brooded an air of
quiet serenity

  there were four members of the
travelers club in the smoking room
and each had drawn up a huge arm-
chair so that they formed a semicir-
cle before the cheery fire

  these four men were travelers all
and would have been introduced as
sir henry faber k c m  k b
e f r g s to the right of the fire
next him sat sir welldon mainwar-
ing k c b k c s i k n s f
r h s g s while joseph wilson
b c h f r c p f r s e was
the third man

  in the fourth chair sat the hon
stanley bellchambers

  by jove drawled sir henry
faber dyou know it is just five
years this week since we have all met
at the same time in the club then
however we had a fifth where is
he  still shooting at lions and hitting
monkeys  old grey always was a bad
shot i shall not forget the time
when he shot a keeper in the leg it
cost 

  yes where is allison grey bell-
chambers    asked wilson   he was a
good sort but he always was a mud-
dler

  bellchambers the man appealed to
did not join in the laughter which
escaped from the lips of the other
three

  poor old allison grey has gone
west he said quietly

  immediately the faces of the others
assumed a solemn look

                                 


weird tales

  you mean to say said main-
waring im sorry how did it
happen  

  it is the first i have heard about
this   said faber   the last i heard
about him was that he was sailing for
liberia did he die out there or

was he- he made an eloquent

gesture which spoke for itself

  allison grey is not alive and
that is all i can tell you he didnt
die naturally and he certainly was
not killed  

  that if i may say so joined in
mainwaring sounds like a paradox
but how do you know

    because   answered bellcham-
bers    was with him when his spirit
left this earth i will tell you the
story he paused and then he sat
up suddenly and leaning over to sir
welldon mainwaring he said sharply
mainwaring do you believe in
mesmerism   

  before he answered mainwaring
thought for a few seconds if you
ask me whether i really believe that
one person can mesmerize another
with my experience of the indian na-
tives i say emphatically yes in
my belief the so-called wonderful in-
dian rope trick is nothing but a
hypnotic suggestion to the audience
who imagine something that never
happens

  your two words hypnotic sug-
gestion mainwaring are the two
words i have been hunting for lis-
ten and i will tell you of the passing
of allison grey

  the men leant back comfortably in
their chairs and as a waiter came in
answer to their ring wilson ordered
a fresh supply of liqueurs they
soon arrived and then the three of
these men listened to a tale that en-
thralled even hardened travelers such
as they as the tale unfolded their
cigars died out and the liqueurs re-
mained untouched

tt was about eighteen months
ago started bellchambers
that i determined to make a trip
into the interior of liberia as a mat-
ter of fact my reason for making this
trip was that during my previous
travels in liberia i had heard that in
a certain village not far from the
niger in the mandingo country the
natives had a new fetish which was
causing an extraordinary amount of
interest not only to the village itself
and its neighbors but for many
many miles around as the majority
of villages have their own particular
fetishes and their own witch doctors
it occurred to me that it must indeed
be something out of the ordinary to
excite such a commotion it was said
that there were pilgrimages being
made every week from villages as far
distant as fifty miles to see the won-
derful fetish

  in due course i had all prepara-
tions completed and having hired
twenty vai men as porters i made a
start of course it took me quite a
time to get near my destination but
i noticed that the nearer i got to
windina the name of the village at
which the fetish resided the quieter
and the more secretive were the na-
tives neither could my vai boys get
any information as to what the fetish
was

  one day i happened to strike the
epwesi village of kinko and having
duly presented the chief with a pres-
ent i was shown to the guest house
and here i lay down and went to
sleep

  in the middle of the night i was
awakened by one of my vai boys who
reported that one of the villagers
wanted urgently to speak to me i
saw the villager and learnt that no-
goni the chief was dying and had
sent for me to save him

  i went to see nogoni and found
his face screwed up in pain

   oh master he groaned when
he saw me i am dying of sickness
the choking of allison grey



chief save me and i will do all you
ask me

  i soon diagnosed his trouble and
found that all he wanted was a dose
of castor oil which i always carry
about with me for cases of this sort
which are frequent this i adminis-
tered and told him he would not die
before dawn and that i would see
him just one hour after the siyi
cock had crowed

  i kept my promise and of course
his pain had gone

   chief he said you have saved
me with your nasty abominations i
will keep my word command me
and you shall have all my seven
daughters as your wives

  i hastily explained that i did not
wish his seven daughters as my wives
as i did not feel inclined to marry
but he could oblige me by giving me
some information concerning the new
fetish of windina

  his face fell when i asked him
this but he kept his word

   oh master he began five
moons ago i and ngesgi the witch
doctor and some of the elders of the
village made a pilgrimage to windina
to offer up prayer to the new god
and take presents oh chief i may
not tell you of what i saw for it is
death to any white man to see the
god for it is said that when a white
man sees the god of windina then
shall terrible calamity descend on the
mandingo people

   can you not tell me nogoni
what the god is like whether it is
small or large

   oh master i should die if i
told you for mbena the witch doc-
tor of windina would order me to

die

  at this i pondered to myself for
i could see that i could extract no
more information from nogoni i
must unconsciously have been think-
ing aloud for while i was wondering
whether they would dare kill a white

man for seeing the fetish nogoni
broke in on my thought

   master they would indeed kill
any white man who saw the god for
already one white man is waiting
death which will come when the new
moon begins he but touched the
house in which dwells the new god
 what say you nogoni have
they dared set hands on a nu-kule
white man

  my face must have betrayed my
anger for nogoni looked fright-
ened

   master that is what i have
heard 

  under these circumstances it de-
volved upon me to rescue the white
man whoever he might be

 cor some days i traveled through
the bush and then crossing
through an extremely thick belt of
forest i approached windina i sent
one of my vai boys forward with
some handsome presents for the
chief and also a present for the fet-
ish he soon returned with the in-
solent message that i must not enter
the village but that bebioni would
condescend to come to meet me pres-
ently arrived some windina boys
with reciprocal presents and a mes-
sage to the effect that bebioni was on
his way he arrived a few minutes
later with a retinue of warriors and
wives and the elders of the villages
on seeing my party they halted i
stepped forward and bebioni did the
same

   chief i said wherefore am i
bidden not to enter your village
when i come on a peaceful errand
and have sent you presents

   master he replied you know
of the new god of windina and you
would set eyes on the god but
the good god has communicated to
m bena that no white man may defile
its presence

   and wherefore to good mbena
the witch doctor comes this madness


weird tales

that he bids the white man begone
oh bebioni you know the power of
the white man and if you kill one
then will come many hundreds of
others with sticks of fire which go
pop-pop-pop and will kill many score
with a streak of lightning then
your good god would blame bebioni
for their deaths 

  he was visibly impressed by my
rating of the powers of the european
and least of all did he like the men-
tion of the blame being put on his
shoulders by the good god seeing
this i pursued my advantage still
farther

   bebioni the stick of fire which
goes pop-pop-pop has whispered into
my ears that there lies in your village
a white man

    his eyes fell before mine and he
shifted uneasily from one foot to an-
other

   master i know not of what you
speak 

   bebioni that stick of fire which
goes pop-pop-pop has whispered into
my ears that when the new moon be-
gins that white man will be sacrificed
to the good god because the white
man began to lay his hands on the
building of the good god further-
more if that white man die then will
come many white men and the gun
will go pop-pop-pop and many lives
will be lost

   master he replied in a weak
voice the gun which goes pop-pop-
pop has told you wrongly 

      bebioni already i hear the pop-
ping of the gun and see many natives
dying i see many white men seizing
bebioni and they throw a rope over
the tree and bebioni is hanging by
the neck

   master he shall be released

   bebioni will invite me into the
village 

   master bebioni wishes you to
stay in windina

in due course and with proper
solemnity i marched into the vil-
lage with my twenty vai boys we
were greeted with scowls but were
not molested and i was shown to the
guest house soon a messenger ar-
rived asking me to meet bebioni

  i followed the messenger and we
arrived at a meeting of the villagers
seated in a big chair was bebioni
who was surrounded by his wives
and elders of the village at his
right hand was the chief witch doctor
who i judged and rightly as i after-
ward found to be mbena squatting
in a semicircle round the chair were
the natives of the village

     oh master  cried bebioni when
he saw me approaching i have in-
vited you hither in order that you
might tell the gun that goes pop-pop-
pop that the white man is to be re-
leased fetch the white man

  i was watching mbenas face as
bebioni said this and if ever i saw
a face containing a look of cruel
vindictiveness and cunning it was
then i trembled for the white man
there was a stir as some of the na-
tives returned with the captive i
did not recognize the dirty face and
the unkempt appearance till the
prisoner gave a cheery laugh and
then i knew i was face to face with
allison grey

  the speaker paused and there was
a quietness in the smoking room not
a sound was heard until mainwaring
found his cigar was out and struck
a match to relight it wilson sud-
denly discovering a waiter at his side
saying did you ring sir knew
then that it was the fourth time the
question had been asked but the
other three times it had not reached
his consciousness

  no he said irritably and waved
him away but a voice came from be-
hind the four yes john a cura-
oa   the four looked up and to
their surprize found several of the
members had come in during the
the choking of allison grey



story and had drawn up to listen
go on bellchambers dont mind us
we wont interrupt said one of the
newcomers and he went on but
you were all so absorbed that you did
not notice me and i was so interested
i took the liberty of listening

  thats all right said bellcham-
bers with a far-away look in his eyes

  presently he continued

  you can imagine what a surprize
i had when i found that the white
man i had rescued was our old friend
allison grey

      hullo old chap  he yelled over
to me in english you didnt expect
to find me here did you say
though who won the derby

  you all know the kind of ass grey
was but he was no coward i think
he would have made a joke with his
executioner had he ever been hung

  bebioni now spoke whiteman
he said to grey you who put hands
on the sacred building of the good
god you should have died ay and
you would have died on the first
night of the new moon as ndyara
the lion uttered his first hunting
call if chief bellchambers had not
told me of the gun which goes pop-
pop-pop had you set eyes on the
good god nothing would have saved
you for the good god would have
protected us from the pop-pop-pop
gun

  all would have been well now for
grey was free and bebioni in a good
temper we could have left at once
and grey would have lived to have
told this tale but like the cheerful
idiot he always was as usual he put
his foot in it

   pah he cried and snapped his
fingers i dont care that much for
your blessed old god it cant harm
me

  pandemonium broke loose for the
natives rose up with a shrill yell and
in another moment they would have
rushed us both and neither of us
would have lived another second but

bebioni and m bena halted them just
in time

   peace called out bebioni in a
huge voice  i have granted the
white man his liberty

    the natives sullenly squatted once
more but many were the scowls that
grey received

 then mbena spoke listen
white man he said in quiet tones
listen you who put hands on the
house of the good god and look at
me

  grey looked him in the eyes his
lips and nose sneering mbenas
glance caught and fixed his eyes to
his own and grey stood there bound
by a stronger will than his to look
into mbenas eyes while mbena in
slow monotonous tones recited the fol-
lowing listen oh doomed white
man listen to the edict of mbena
the witch doctor the devil doctor the
right hand of bebioni the chosen of
the windina and servant of the good
god listen to me i say by the grace
of bebioni chief of the windina in
the mandingo country you who have
mocked the good god shall suffer
no native hands shall touch you for
we fear the pop-pop-pop gun but
you shall die yes you shall choke
to death on the first night shall you
fear much and sleep not on the sec-
ond night less fear shall you feel
and on the third be quite easy and
mock the good god once more but
on the fourth night you shall dream
of being choked and wake to find it
but a dream then shall you rejoice
on the fifth night once more you
shall dream and once more wake still
to feel the fingers choking on the
sixth night no sleep shall you get for
the fear which will consume you and
on the seventh night when the new
moon rises for the first time then
shall the unseen fingers of the good
god strangle you till breath ceases
and you will know the power of the
good god chief bellchambers shall
live for he respects the good god


weird tales

and the good god is pleased with the
presents which the chief sent thus
says mbena the witch doctor the
devil doctor the right hand of be-
bioni the chosen of the windina the
servant of the good god

  the chant came to an end and
grey shivered and i could see the
sweat pouring from his forehead
slowly he turned away and in his
eyes i saw a great fear

  we left windina soon after-
ward and made for the coast again
poor grey never said a word for
hours the vai boys also were quiet
and every now and again would give
a pitying glance at grey

xtigiit came at last and we
camped greys nerve had
gone and he could scarcely eat and
he would keep on easting frightened
glances over his shoulder as if fear-
ing an attack the fire could not be
made hot enough for him huddled
in his blankets he sat there moaning
i tried to buck him up but when i
spoke he only looked at me blankly
as if he did not understand what i
was saying it was some time before
i fell asleep and he was still awake
then

  the next morning he was better
more like his old self and when
breakfast was over he was laughing
and joking with his old abandon he
tried to shoot a bubal hartebeeste
which we saw and with his old clum-
siness hit something which squeaked
quite ten yards away from the object
he kept lively during the day but
as evening approached he became
quieter

  once more we camped and he
exhibited the same symptoms as on
the previous evening but to a lesser
degree and i had the satisfaction of
seeing him fall asleep before i too
joined him in the paradise of rest

  i need say nothing about the next
day or even the next night for he
was just as you all knew him a jolly

carefree devil as brave as you make
them and as careless as a yasiri
hippopotamus by this time he was
ridiculing all that had happened in
windina and treating it all as a huge
joke just as mbena had said he
would i must admit however that
i too really did not feel any real
alarm because i did not see how a
man could be strangled without the
aid of a human agency and it was
only natural that the queer effect
which the witch doctors recitation
had had on us should wear off with
the passing of time therefore on
the third night allison grey mocked
the good god and defied it to do its
worst

  on the fourth day we reached
nogonis village again his surprize
at seeing allison grey still alive was
only exceeded by his admiration for
me for having effected the release of
the white man

  as it was after  oclock and we
had been traveling continuously for
seven days i decided to stop the
night in the village so we lay down
on blankets in the guest house which
i will admit was kept decidedly
cleaner than the majority of such
places the rest of the day we
strolled round the village and talked
to the villagers

  when i went to bed i had a com-
fortable feeling that the episode of
the windina village was completely
over

  it seemed as though i had scarce-
ly closed my eyes when i felt a rough
shaking at my shoulder and sprang
up to find it was grey waking me

  not in the best of humor at this
summary awakening i asked him
what the devil he wanted in a some-
what angry voice but when i looked
at his eyes what i saw there made
me soften for there was the fear of
death in them

  my god bellehambers  he
shouted and there was an awful ring
the choking of allison grey



in his voice whos been in this
place 

 i struck a match and by its
flickering light found that with the
exception of our two selves the room
was empty no one i replied and
thus questioned him in turn what
ails you man

  having satisfied himself that the
hut really was empty and that no
one apparently had entered he
calmed down and went on to tell me
that soon after he had fallen asleep
he dreamt that mbena had entered
the hut and putting his knees on his
greys chest had clutched him by
the throat and commenced throttling
him

    i persuaded him that it was noth-
ing but a dream and at length he fell
asleep again

 the next day we bid nogoni
adieu and i really believe he was
sorry we were going for he had taken
a liking to me he was not a bad
sort either and his sense of humor
was undoubtedly strong even for the
natives who are as a whole decidedly
humorous although perhaps some of
their more subtle humor would not
appeal to the european taste nogoni
advised me to sleep at a village at
which his sisters husband was chief
and as it was comparatively on my
way i decided to do so and one of
nogonis men came with us

  during the march grey several
times referred to his dream of the
previous night and in some uneanny
way it depressed him for his spirits
were very low although why a bad
dream should depress a person for
the following twenty-four hours is
beyond my comprehension

ttaving found nogonis sisters

  -ti husband we slept at his vil-
lage

  grey seemed a bit afraid to go
to sleep but after some persuasion i
made him realize that no one could
get in without my hearing and to ap-

pease him i set one of my vai boys
on guard outside the door

  several hours afterward i was
awakened by terrible screams jump-
ing up hurriedly i lit a torch and
rushed over to grey

   drag him off stanley he
yelled the beggars choking me i
cant breathe

  his voice sank to a husky whis-
per while his hands clawed at his
throat i rubbed my eyes but there
was no one to be seen i shook grey
by the shoulders and his antics
ceased and sanity returned into his
eyes he grasped hold of my hand
as a drowning man would grasp a
straw and sobbed

   stanley he moaned why
didnt you kill him

   who i asked

   mbena he was on my chest
choking me

  i examined him for signs of
malaria but could find no trace of
fever my dear old allison i said
to him gently no one has been in
this house since we both came to-
gether and i called the vai boy
who corroborated my statement

    i decided that we had been
marching too much and the heat
was affecting greys brain so i made
up my mind to stop for three days at
the village we were in-i forget its
name at the moment grey seemed
rather glad

  the following morning he was
even more depressed than the day be-
fore and he just sat and shivered the
whole day long when night came
he begged of me not to go to sleep
and to oblige him i said i wouldnt
but my flesh or brain was stronger
than my will-power and i fell asleep
nothing awakened me however but
when i awoke in the morning i found
grey had not slept a wink the whole
night through and his eyes had sunk
in and his cheeks were hollow

  he clung to me like a little child
and when the vai boy brought some
weird tales

breakfast in he scarcely had strength
to lift the spoon to his mouth and
half of the food slopped over the side
and messed down his trousers

  in vain i tried to cheer him up
and tell him we would soon reach
the coast and then england nothing
could move him and he just clung to
me and moaned and sobbed

   dont let him come tonight
stanley shoot him if he comes near
for god sake protect me and
that is how he kept on the whole day
long i offered him a native-made
cigarette made by one of my vai
boys out of native tobacco but he
turned it round and round in his fin-
gers and looked at it as if he had
never before seen a cigarette when
i placed it in his mouth and lit it he
puffed at it two or three times and
then threw it away

  the long day dragged painfully
on and on the midday meal was
brought in and this time grey would
not touch it as the afternoon drew
on his mind partly broke and he took
me for mbena and seized my throat
i struggled in vain with the strength
of a madman he treated me like a
baby and had it not been for some
of my boys entering at the sound of
the struggle my life would have been
ended there and then this i treated
as a lesson and so i arranged for
six of my boys to stay up and look
after him during the night

  as darkness fell he recovered his
sanity and also his fears and he
cowered in a corner covering his
face with his arms

  the night dragged on slowly all
the surrounding jungle was awake
and i could hear the animals uttering
their different hunting cries instinc-
tive i waited for the roars of the
lion once i heard him giving a
long wailing cry as he called for his
cubs and mates to follow him and i
looked sharply over to grey but
nothing happened
then suddenly arising above all
other sounds of the jungle i heard
the roars of his majesty as he hunt-
ed and it sounded like the deep re-
verberating rolls of distant thunder

   my god my throat he is at
my throat grey yelled out and a
faint beam of the new moon shone
through a crack in the door he
threw himself on the floor rolled
about in wild paroxysms and clawed
at his own throat

     get hold of his arms  i shouted
to the terrified boys they did so
and it required all our combined
strength to hold him down there
was a gurgle in his throat and his
eyes rolled fearfully then as the
loud roar of the lion died away i
heard the death rattle in allisons
throat

  i struck a match and on the skin
were two purple blotches just as if
grey were strangled to death

 a jolly fine yarn but a pure co-
-- incidence said one of the
members who had been listening

  perhaps answered bellcham-
bers slowly
the story so far

through an instrument called the myrdoscope
 brett gryce sees a girl in a distant world men-
aced by a giant her world is so vast that a sec-
ond of time there takes whole years of earthly
measure during three years he catches glimpses
of the girl and her peril the giant about to bring
down a huge tree on her head and the girl
awakening to a sense of terror but all this has
taken but a second of time on that vaster world
brett and martt gryce set out to rescue the girl
in a space-ship invented by their father dr
gryce which can change its position in time and
space they increase their size to fifty million
times what it was on earth and penetrate beyond
our universe faster than the speed of light until
they are lost in the black immensity of space

chapter 

a single starlit night-
an eternity

brett had momentarily paused
in his narrative but when we
would have plied him with
questions he waved us aside

  let us finish first the panic that
was upon us with this knowledge-
belief-that we were lost out there in
time and size and space did not last

this story begun in weird tales for april

the girl screamed-a little
voice shrill with terror an
agony of sudden fear

long for we fought against it and
presently we were calmer-able to
reason our size-dials were at rest-
we had shut off the switch by earth
standards the vehicle was 
miles in height our relative time
was a century of yours to a little
more than a minute of ours some

	years into your earth-future
had already piled up on the earth
standard time-dial-and we were
adding one hundred years to it al-
most every minute our velocity
had reached a maximum of 
light-years per hour-and we were

	light-years from earth the
velocity was now lessening a trifle it
dropped nearly to an even 
with unchanging size now with
nothing near us to repel or attract
the ether friction overcame inertia to
reach a balance of forces

 we conquered our fear-began
to reason what we should do it was
of course futile to look for your aural




weird tales

ray it had been extinguished thou-
sands of years we wanted to go on
to our destination and it was the non-
operation of the myrdoscope which

worried and puzzled usi was

sure father that up to this point in
the voyage i had made no serious er-
ror of direction the image of the
girl should have been before us but
the myrdoscope would not work

 the time- i suggested

 ah no frank we had pro-
gressed very little into the time of
that girls life she should still have
been reclining there on the bank or
at least the bank itself should have
been there we puzzled over what
could be the trouble with the myrdo-
scope we found the trouble-

  i found it said martt eagerly

  brett nodded yes it was martt
who reasoned it out a curious ex-
planation-and one i think which
involves the greatest of all the issues
we had encountered the myrdoscope
would not operate for a very big but
very simple reason you would think
to find the answer in science not
so it was a theosophical reason
father

  brett was very earnest and very
solemn it was my purpose you
understand to reach the girl at the
exact moment we had always seen
her we planned to make our time
before reaching her coincident with
hers of that given instant remem-
ber that consider then at this other
instant when now we were trying to
see her through the myrdoscope our
time-rate had carried us about 
years into earths future but also
it had carried us some forty minutes
into the girls future

  not science now metaphysics
perhaps-and certainly theology
and theosophy we were destined to
be with the girl during those forty
minutes and we could not now look
ahead and see ourselves-see our fu-
ture actions

  father youve spoken of that
what you said was true it is not
gods way that man should look at
his own little future not best for
us the almighty knows it and has
prohibited it chaos would result
for we live upon hope there was no
scientific reason why the myrdoscope
should not show us what we were
destined to do during those forty
minutes yet-it was dead dark
inoperative

  and this now i know with all
the science in the world there are
some things you can not do-those
things which transgress the creators
laws before them-against all
scientific reason logic-we must fail
you can not see your future you can
only live it once nor can you go
back through time to stop in your
own past to live again your life-to
do differently than you did before it
is unthinkable - impossible even
though now we have the scientific
means to accomplish it it is not the
almightys plan-and he will not let
us do it

  we reasoned all this out it was
simple enough we had our time-
switch which would change our time-
rate irrespective of the normal time-
change inherent to our size    that
was what puzzled you awhile ago
frank well now we used that
time-change mechanism

  it brought us new sensations a
shock a queer humming lightness
pervading the vehicle the air our
own bodies a lightness as though
almost we were mere shadows of our
former selves specters a ghostly
vehicle humming with an infinite
vibration

  presently that all wore away or
at least we grew used to it-so that
had there been anything in space to
see as very soon there was ourselves
were the substance-all else the
shadows
explorers into infinity



  we went backward very slightly
in time i suppose some forty min-
utes of the girls time i tested it
by the myrdoscope the instrument
flashed on it was operating a
continuous retrograde action of the
time-mechanism was necessary to
hold us upon that single given instant
of the girls existence the calcula-
tion was intricate i reached it part-
ly by mathematics partly by experi-
mentation with the myrdoscope i
saw fragments of the girls immedi-
ate past as our time-change swung
us into it saw her arrive alone in
the woodland dell saw her lie down
at ease with a security unsuspecting
saw the grinning vicious little
gnomes creep upon her the leering
giant appear and made then an-
other startling discovery-ill tell
you about it in a moment

  at last i had the time-change
correctly gaged we were-in rela-
tion to the girl-standing still in
time presently we again increased
our size an alteration of the time-
mechanism was needed a progressive
alteration but this was simple to
calculate and to adjust

  frannie asked what was your
discovery

  he smiled curious as always
little sister it was that the giant
was in the act of becoming smaller
the gnomes were growing in size
he checked our chorus of exclama-
tions

  i will tell you now this giant-
these gnomes-were three beings who
did not belong to the girls world
they had come there from a greater
world outside the atom by means of
science-such means possibly as we
now were using with the vehicle-
they had diminished their stature to
the infinitely small had gone down
and down into their tiny atom to
come upon the girl and her realm

ii

again brett waved us aside not
now please oh yes-i can tell
you the structure of this our little
fragment of the material universe
but let me finish first about our
voyage

  with our time-change corrected
the myrdoscope readily had picked
up the image of the girl a larger
image for we were  light-years
closer to her the same scene strick-
en again of motion the giant stand-
ing there the gnome climbing upon
the girls ankle and herself just
aware of her danger with dawning
terror on her face

  the electro-telescope also was
working now looking behind us we
could just see the last of the stars
and soon they were gone a day of
our conscious existence went by at

	light-years an hour we added

	light-years of distance-a total
from earth of about  the
black abyss of space had not re-
mained empty off to one side had
been a faint glow a nebula a patch
of star-dust through the telescope
we could see stars-a complete starry
universe it was as large no doubt
as that we had passed through

  it gave us a new idea of the im-
mensity of space separated by
some  light-years from our own
universe of stars-of which the solar
system is so tiny a part-this other
star-patch was equally as large and
yet it seemed to lie isolated in fathom-
less space it drifted by us and in a
few hours was gone and far off to
the other side of us another patch
came past and others each several
thousand light-years in extent each
isolated from all its fellows

  we traveled another full day
over  light-years from earth
yet the girls image was seemingly
not coming nearer very rapidly we
felt the voyage would take too long
so again we increased our size 


weird tales

  i interrupted had you calcu-
lated the girls relative size

  yes he said in a moment
prank you shall have it we-our
vehicle-was  miles high com-
pared to earth we increased it to
 our velocity also increased
at a million miles of height-i have
made all my stated figures round
numbers but they are approximately
correct-at this million-mile height
we reached normality to the girl it
simplified our mechanism adjust-
ments there was no longer a size-
change necessary a retrograde
time-change equal to our own now
normal rate of existence held us at
that same instant of her life

  our velocity was more than pro-
portionately increased to demon-
strate that mathematically would be
intricate-would involve several
very complicated formulas which
would not interest you now   we
passed distantly a score or more of
starry universes-to the sides and
above and below us-lying in every
plane and of every size and general
extent some were small a few thou-
sand light-years like our own others
immense one which seemed 
light-years at least in diameter

  we reached ultimately a maxi-
mum velocity of about  light-
years an hour we had previously
gone  light-years from earth
we traveled some eighty additional
hours not all at the maximum-for
possibly half that time we were
steadily accelerating and at a total
of  light-years from the
earth a faint glow of seeming phos-
phorescence showed in the blackness
beneath us

  there was a universe to one side
ahead of us but this was a different
light a radiation from the inner
surface itself the inner surface of
the hollow little atom within which
all this space and its infinitesimal
whirling electrons is contained they

are immense suns to us here on
earth but from the larger viewpoint
they were mere electrons whirling
flashing around in tiny orbits a thou-
sand times a second

  the girl and her realm as we
had thought are on this inner sur-
face of what we may choose to call an
atom themselves-this girl and her
people-are infinitesimal this atom
of ours is merely some tiny particle
of matter in that other world from
which the giant and the gnomes had
descended a tiny particle of mat-
ter call it a grain of sand lying
with trillions of its fellows upon some
great ocean beach-lying there in the
light of stars shining in infinite space
above it lying there for a single
starlit night which is all eternity for
us a single starlit night-an eter-
nity infinity of space and time
why even now i have seen no more
than an infinitesimal fragment of
them 

    the giant and gnomes were
doubtless normally of the same size-
only momentarily did they happen to
be different    wait frannie
please i cant tell it to you any
faster    the inner surface became
visible to our telescopes at about

	light-years a realm of
land and water vegetation strange
of aspect yet normal too it
stretched beneath us in every direc-
tion-a huge concave surface

  we kept our size but using the
repellent force of this inner surface
i gradually cut down our velocity
down more and more until that last
light-year or so took us a week to
traverse the girl father is ap-
proximately  light-years
from here we-our earth-may be
near the center of the void i dont
know perhaps we are much nearer
the girls side it isnt important 

  the inner surface at last lay
close beneath us it took us an addi-
explorers into infinity



tional week of diminishing velocity
to reach its atmosphere i was cau-
tious i had the velocity under con-
trol always

  he paused a moment seeming
carefully to consider his next words
i want you now to forget earth
standards take the larger viewpoint
exclusively let me speak of miles
not in relation to earth but miles-
in relation to the inner surface-
which are  million times longer
let me speak then of myself as again
but six feet high the vehicle 
feet high realize that by the larger
standards i was but one-twentieth of
a light-year from earth

  dr gryce said gravely your
telescope would show a globe like the
earth very plainly at one-twentieth
of a light-year of distance you
must explain brett why you could
not see it- any of the great stars
of our immediate universe

  brett nodded we could not see
the earth because to our size it was
merely a little orange to be more
exact a ball about five inches in
diameter a tiny ball i could have
held in my hand whirling out there
in space spinning like a top on its
axis to make your infinitesimal days
and nights traversing its entire orbit
-a complete revolution around its
little sun-more than three times
every second

  with these other standards then
i want you to visualize us as we sat
on the floor of the vehicle gazing
down through the lower window we
were say a hundred miles above the
inner surface just entering the up-
per strata of its atmosphere and fall-
ing gently downward beneath us
lay a broad vista of land and water
vegetation forests here and there
patches of human habitation-houses
villages it was a strange unfamiliar
landscape yet not unduly abnormal
in every direction-as we dropped

closer-it spread upward to our hori-
  w t-

zon a rolling country gently un-
dulating hills broad valleys-and off
near the horizon a jagged mountain
range it seemed not far away we
could see black yawning holes in it
the mouths of caves or tunnels per-
haps

  the broad crescent lake lay
directly beneath us trees bordered
its banks trees strange of shape-yet
one would call them trees at once a
collection of low fiat-roofed buildings
lay beside the water a village-or
a city the buildings were queerly
curved - seemingly crescent-shaped
they had no straight lines they
seemed generally of but one story
though a few were larger and upon
an eminence near the water stood one
much larger more ornate of shape
than all the others

  it was not a fantastic scene but
wholly rational to our own accepted
standards a sylvan atmosphere
seemed to hang upon it trees and
flowers were everywhere the roof-
tops seemed gardens as luxuriant as
those beside the houses the streets
were broad and orderly and beyond
the city ribbons of roads wound out
over the hills

  a sylvan landscape with an air
of quiet peace upon it i felt a sense
of surprize this was not modern-
ity nor a civilization more advanced
than our own-nor yet was it bar-
barism later i knew it was deca-
dence a people who once had been
far up the slope of civilization over
the peak and now were coming down
upon the other side the peaceful
restful ease of decadence which to
complete the inevitable cycle of all
human life ultimately would again
bring them to barbarism

  we saw these details as we fell
gently toward the crescent lake you
will notice i have not mentioned color
in the scheme nor movement our
time-mechanism was operating the


weird tales

  scene beneath us was stricken motion-
less since always we were holding to
the same instant of its time an
unreality lay upon it a flat shadowy
grayness of aspect an unnatural
stillness we dropped closer a
shadowy boat seemed on the lake-a
boat with a sail it lay there immo-
bile the water was rippled by a
breeze but they were frozen ripples
and in the streets now we saw peo-
ple and curious vehicles-all stand-
ing like waxen figures

  the grove of trees-the woodland
dell wherein the girl was lying-was
a short distance down the lake shore
from the city a single house was
near it but in the other direction was
unbroken forest an open space was
there-a few hundred feet from the
girl and her assailants we decided
to land there we knew we were in-
visible as yet-a ghost of a vehicle
all in this same instant coming from
space to land upon ihe lake shore

  we had not yet decided just what
we would do but it was necessary to
land first and necessary also for
the vehicle to assume the time-rate
of this realm before we could leave
it when that was done we would be
normal humans to rescue the girl as
best we might

  we dropped into the little clear-
ing at the edge of the lake and gent-
ly came to rest-and upon the sur-
face of the ground since to us it
would have had no siibstance but
within a foot of it whore like a ghost
hoveling i held us level the un-
reality of us i must repeat was not
to us apparent we seemed solid-it
was the ground the forest about us
which was unreal spectral trees a
gray twilight i made sure that
nothing was touching us we were
a few inches only above a soft-looking
gray ground we were ready to cut
off our time-change-to take our
places normal to this new realm

chapter 

the encounter in the
forest glade

martt said   i would have thrown
off the time-switch and rushed
out at once but brett wanted to
talk about it

  brett smiled it was difficult for
us to remember that no haste was
needed no haste-until we took the
girls time-rate and then we would
need all haste possible we discussed
what we were to do we had weapons
-the electronic flash for instance
with which we could have struck
down that giant as with a lightning
bolt but could we i was not sure
-not absolutely sure-that the
weapon would be operative or that
perchance this giant would not by
some strange means be proof against
it a man sixty feet tall is no mean
adversary suppose he held the girl
before him would i dare attack
i suggested martt put in that
we take the normal time-rate of the
girl and be in hiding until the
giants size had dwindled to hers the
dwarfs were growing but there
would only be three of them against
two of us-and so far as we had seen
they were not armed

  brett went on that didnt seem
a good plan the giants size was
we had calculated rapidly dwin-
dling within five minutes he would
be the girls size but suppose in-
stead of standing there during those
five minutes he picked up the girl-
made off with her it was too
dangerous

  at last we decided to make the
vehicle and thus ourselves somewhat
larger at the risk seriously of
frightening the girl we decided to
take a stature larger than the giant
thus since he was not armed we
would have little difficulty keeping
the girl from harm

the forest glade within which
our vehicle was hovering was ample
explorers into infinity



for the growth we adjusted the
mechanisms and in a few moments
of growth we had reached the de-
termined point we shut oft the
switches the vehicle fell its few
inches to the ground   

  the scene clarified we were in
a somber forest of dull orange-col-
ored vegetation above us was a
deep purple sky with a few drifting
clouds and stars gleaming up there
in the darkness they were the stars
of that last universe we had passed
unnatural of aspect for they seemed
unduly close and unduly small

  it was not day-nor yet was it
night a queerly shimmering twi-
light  shadowless for the light
seemed inherent to everything

  we were aware of all this in an
instant but we did not stop to regard
it for time now was passing the
girl and her assailants were now we
knew in full motion with the flash
cylinders in hand we stepped hastily
from the vehicle doorway

  the forest trees were saplings
no higher than ourselves we
plunged through them came to the
other glade the girl was sitting up
with hands pressed to her breast in
terror-a tiny figure of a girl not as
long as my hand the dwarfs were
so small i did not see them at first
they were standing beside her-an
inch perhaps in height the giant
with what drug acting upon him we
could only guess had dwindled until
he was only about half our own pres-
ent height he had dropped his tree-
bludgeon which now was too large
for him and was stooping down to
seize the girl his leer with the real-
ity of motion upon it was horrible

  momentarily we had stopped at
the edge of the glade the figures
there were aware of us the girl
screamed-a little voice shrill with
terror an agony of sudden fear-at
her assailants and doubtless most of
all at ourselves the giant-i can
no longer call him that since we saw

him as no more than three feet tall-
at our appearance he straightened
stared at us surprize then fear
swept his ugly hairy face he shout-
ed something to his tiny companions

  martts hand went up he fired
his cylinder but he was confused-
and the nearness of the girl to his
mark made him aim high the bolt
missed lodged harmlessly in a tree
with a ripping of its bark i rushed
forward to seize our adversary but
he eluded me leaped over the girl i
was afraid of trampling her-i
stepped backward-clutched martt
fearful of what he might do

  it had all happened in a moment
the dwarfs had vanished but the
other man-he was now no higher
than my knees-was standing by a
tree behind the girl he shouted
again and now the terror had left his
face and he was grinning i saw his
hand go swiftly to his mouth had
he taken more of his strange drug
had he warned his two companions to
do the same  think so for before
my eyes he was swiftly diminishing in
size i knelt carefully beside the girl
her figure-smaller than my foot and
near it-was huddled into a little ball
her head against her upraised knees
she may have fainted i did not heed
her save to be careful my movements
did not strike her with arm
stretched over her i reached for the
man but he hopped away and elud-
ed me still grinning as small now
as my little finger he stood half hid-
ing behind a grass-blade on hands
and knees i pursued him but like
an insect he was too quick for me
smaller always until i was probing
the grass with my fingers to find him
-saw him momentarily like an ant in
size as he leaped into a tangle of tiny
grass-blades and was gone

  i had forgotten my weapon ii-
logically i had had no desire to kill
that tiny figure-only to catch it but
martt had had no such feelings he
was stamping around the glade-try-


weird tales

rag to stamp upon the other figures-
and mumbling angrily to himself i
called to ask if he had caught them
he didnt know he had seen them
momentarily-seen them raise their
hands to their mouths but they had
dwindled so fast they were lost in a
moment

  the girl was unconscious lying
there in a huddled little heap gently
i raised her held her in the palm of
my hand she was white as a little
waxen figure-white and beautiful
and so small i scarce dared to touch
her with my huge rough fingers

  martt brought water from the
lake i rested my hand on the
ground with her still lying in it and
then presently she opened her eyes

  brett paused and as he gazed at
each of us in turn i thought i had
never seen his face so earnest and
there was upon it too a look almost
of exaltation-a look which transfig-
ured it he added gently you
three-my father my sister my
friend i have no need to hide from
you my emotions i think then-in-
congruously perhaps for that little
figure of girlhood lying there so soft
and warm in the palm of my hand-i
think then my love for her was born  

  hide his emotions he could not
had he wished this love in his heart
was written plain on his face to
soften it to uplift it to something-
or so it seemed to me-something just
a little more than human a touch
perchance of divinity and i think
now that love does that-if only for
some fleeting moment-to each one
of us

 he went on very softly she
opened her eyes i was afraid she
would be frightened i tried to look
very gentle compassionate i held
my hand very still i think that for
an instant martt and i stopped
breathing   she opened her eyes-
met mine i saw in hers a flash of
terror but something strangely
must have conquered it-against all

reason as she stared at me stared
while the terror faded and her little
lips parted and smiled a welcome and
a thanks  

chapter 

dwindling giants from
largeness unfathomable

there was not one of us who would
have interrupted brett when he
paused to light an arrant-cylinder
and to choose what next he would tell
us he was speaking softly reminis-
cently and with a curious gentleness

    i carried her to the vehicle
showed it to her obviously she could
understand nothing of my words but
she was very quick to read my ges-
tures smiling readily now with her
fear quite gone and sitting up in
the palm of my hand with her arm
flung about my thumb to steady her
she bade me raise her to my ear her
words-the softest the tiniest of hu-
man voices-what she said was wholly
unintelligible save that i understood
her name was leela

  she stood beside a tree at a dis-
tance while we re-entered the vehicle
and brought it down to a size normal
to her and came out of it to confront
her  

  martt burst out i tell you that
was when i realized how beautiful she
is say you never saw a girl like her
-you cant describe it-

  im not trying said brett with
his gentle smile   she met us-there
by the vehicle-to us then frannie
she was about your size-perhaps a
little smaller she took our hands
laid them against her forehead as
though with a gesture of welcome
and led us presently to her home-
the house near by her father her
mother is dead her father is a musi-
cian noted-very high of rank and
standing among his people a kindly
old man with gray and black hair
worn long to the base of his neck we
explorers into infinity



-martt and i-didnt let ours grow
though as you see we took their mode
of dress

  how long were you there i
asked

  we slept perhaps three hundred
times he answered there are no
days and nights-always that same
half-luminous twilight no change of
seasons-or very little it is nature
in her softest mood nothing to strug-
gle against-life made easy too
easy   it was not we who learned
leelas language but she like an un-
natural precocious child who learned
ours  we created a commotion
among the people the ruler sent for
us   oh i have so much id like to
tell you but martt can tell it-
after-

  he checked himself suddenly his
words some vague hint of what he al-
most had added sent an ominous chill
to my heart and i saw too that dr
gryce had felt it for a cloud came to
his face and in his eyes i saw fear
lurking

  but brett went on at once id
like to tell you of these people a
race at peace with nature and them-
selves the struggle for existence all
in the past decadence the down-
hill grade only by struggle can man
progress father this race with the
peak of its civilization thousands of
generations in its past gently resting
with the inevitable decadence drawing
it inexorably back to the barbarism
from whence it sprung id like to
tell you of their customs their gov-
ernment-their mode of life   some
other time-or martt will tell you  
it was all so beautiful-so ro-
mantic  music-their strange beau-
tiful arts-music as leelas father
gave it-art to take the place of
science and industry   you ask
martt to tell you about the dancing-
the pageants if you want to call them
that to which we went so many times
with leela   but just now im tired
-i think ive talked too much-and

im worried-and it seems to press
me against all the logic of our sci-
ence that i have no time to spend
telling all this to you 

  brett indeed seemed suddenly
tired or perhaps harassed at the
thoughts which had come to him i
had been so absorbed-as had all of
us-that we had given no heed to the
passing hours abruptly i realized
that the room was chill with early
morning through the window i saw
the flush of the eastern sky

  martt followed my glance why
its dawn bretts been talking all
night  

  brett said strangely too long
father this gentle race living out
there in such seeming security had
just been visited by beings from the
great world outside it a world
known to them only by legend of
their past ages which they scarce
knew to be true or false those
three assailants of leela s-and other
men like them-had suddenly ap-
peared as dwindling giants coming
down out of largeness unfathomable
they had already destroyed a
city  

  bretts voice had risen he was
talking faster now and there was a
touch of wildness in his tone-a wild-
ness perhaps born of his exhaustion
and the emotional stress under which
i knew now he had been laboring all
night

  our arrival there father-the
three assailants of leela-i think the
larger him whom we have called the
 giant -i - think he is leader of the
invaders from that greater world
our appearance-our own power to
change size which perhaps he ob-
served there in the foiest-must have
frightened him the invaders van-
ished but at the end of those
months we lived there-another of
these giants was seen

  theyre coming back again-to
threaten leela and all her people i
came here to see you father-to tell


weird tales

you all ive told-and to leave martt
but im going back-to do what i
can against this threat-this invasion
and i want to go back to leela

she-

  she was afraid to come with us
martt put in i wanted her to
come-and now i want to go back
with brett weve been arguing
about it for days-he wont let me go

back with him-hes stubborn-

  brett reiterated im going
back im going alone as soon as
ive slept-ive got to sleep now-
you youll excuse me-let me take a
good long sleep-im too tired to ar-
gue about it now   good night
frannie dear-good night father-
good night frank

  he was presently gone from the
room dr gryce had been sitting be-
side me and i put my hand on his
arm his face was quite colorless
his voice suddenly very old and help-
less was murmuring i dont want
him to go out there again im
afraid-and i dont want him to do
it 

chapter 

 the solitary voyager

tut brett i said there are
-d one or two things i want to ask
you about your return voyage-for

instance-

  it was mid-afternoon brett thor-
oughly rested was wholly himself
again quiet composed and smiling
but very determined even a little
grim and i think he was a bit
ashamed of the sudden almost quer-
ulous way in which he had terminated
his narrative and left us there in the
observation room at dawn he had
had his sleep now and had been
alone for an hour with his father
martt and frannie had been called
to them i-an outsider-was not
asked or wanted what took place
there behind the closed door of the

study it was not for me to ask but
when they came out i knew that
brett had won a questionable vic-
tory for old dr gryce was visibly
broken frannie-pale and upon the
verge of tears and martt for a time
a trifle sullen resentful that he was
to be left behind i think it hurt
brett-this fear he was bringing up-
on those he loved but he was very
determined convinced that it was the
right thing for him to do

  i start back tonight-frank he
told me soberly as he emerged from
the study

  oh i said for how long will
you be gone this time   

  he hesitated a look which even
now my memory fails to interpret
came to him then he smiled i
dont know but remember frank
i can return-with only those limi-
tations the almighty enforces-i can
return to any point of earth-time i
wish as you will live it-well i
shall aim to return here within a
month

  it was then i asked him about the
return voyage he and martt had just
made brett ive been wondering
-did our aural ray guide you
back

  yes he said on the voyage
back the first thing i did was to put
the vehicle back through time to a
chosen instant at which i wished to
arrive here on earth when that was
done i held that instant always we
could not see the aural ray going
out-when we looked back for it-for
two reasons one our time had run
far into earths future and the ray
was non-existent the other even
had we taken the proper time-point
we were outrunning the light-rays
themselves in space i mean the
aural ray left earth only with the
speed of light our velocity exceeded
that you see but on the return
voyage we encountered the ray as we
came in a mere flash over the sky
explorers into infinity



but its characteristic color-bands
guided us

  what he said about outrunning the
light-rays made me think of the
myrdoscope the image of that girl-
which they had received here on
earth before the voyage-that image
had crossed a space  light-
years in extent but when i men-
tioned it he explained

  the myrdal rays are not light
frank but only akin to it their
velocity-why light beside them is a
laggard we have no way of com-
puting the velocity of the myrdal
rays but over a finite distance such
as five million light-years-for
practical purposes it is instantane-
ous  

  i wanted to tell you-i was con-
fused last night-i meant to explain
that coming back i used quite a dif-
ferent method from the outward trip
i chanced a disturbance of some of
those outlying starry universes and
when we left the inner surface i
made the vehicle larger instead of
smaller the void of space shrank
until about us the universes were
clustered like little patches of mist-
tiny areas of glowing star-dust i
saw our own with its spectrum of
the aural ray quite readily and
had reached it with a voyage of a
few hours-and then reduced our
size

  and your time i said brett
i didnt see the vehicle until it was
almost entering the earths atmos-
phere and-just for an instant-
it seemed not solid but like a vague
gray ghost then suddenly it ma-
terialized  

 he smiled and nodded yes
that was when i took the earths
normal time-rate

  the family joined us we said no
more and that night brett left us
for his solitary voyage i would not
set down here in detail those last
good-byes emotion repressed - it

was what was not said that held a
pathos i shall never forget an out-
ward attempt at lightness martt
laughed give my love to leela
and frannie said you tell her im
jealous because shes so beautiful
just before brett closed the door
of the vehicle dr gryce spoke-the
only thing he had said for an hour
past

  youll be sure to come back
brett within the month lad
oh yes yes father dear
well-good-bye  

good-bye i can think of no sad-

brave little beacon striv-
ing to pierce infinity

that little month of anxious
watching and waiting passed so
slowly and yet so quickly as one
by one its golden moments of hope
drained away

  brett did not return a month
then a year while dr gryce made
me leave the service to enter his
that all my time might be spent in
watching

  a year and now another year has
passed brett would return within
the month with his time-mechan-
ism unimpaired no delay out there
in the beyond could have affected
his return to reach us during that
first little month with that passed
and gone reason could only show the
futility of expecting him ever yet
reason plays so small a part when it
would seek to kill hope

  the aural ray still bums-brave
little beacon striving to pierce in-
finity beside it for those long un-
reasoning hours of vigil dr gryce
sits and waits silent grayer and
every day visibly older the possi-
bilities of what could have happened
to brett-that myriad of futile hu-
man conjectures-we have long since


weird tales

ceased voicing alone i sometimes
speculate has brett gone on into
that outside world of which we all
are only a tiny atom what is he
doing and then i tell myself what
is it to me save that it concerns
brett the myriad unfathomable
happenings of eternal time in in-
finite space-what right have i one
tiny mortal to probe them

  the beacon burns to guide brett

back to us will he ever come i
wonder my brain with its logic
says he will not but my heart says
might he not come tonight or
with tonight passed then tomorrow
he will be here thus hope runs on
and on daunted but never broken
blessed hope to make possible a cour-
ageous living of this little life until
we ourselves are plunged into that
glowing infinity of the hereafter

ghost lore

    by gertrude wright

     there are things we dare not name

     there are formless nameless things

     silent shapes with sable wings

     born of shadows and of shame

     see them winding wo-bedight
     through the labyrinths of night

     creatures pallid and forlorn

     crawling forth from new-made graves

     riding on the winds and waves

     other creatures yet unborn

     see them winding wo-bedight
     through the labyrinths of night

     progeny of doubt and fear

     some walk headless oer the hills

     some are great eternal wills

     working evil everywhere

     see them winding wo-bedight
     through the labyrinths of night

     writhing twisting serpent things

      coiling through the sultry skies

     flashing rolling greenish eyes

     flapping flaming fiery wings

     see them winding wo-bedight
     through the labyrinths of night

     moaning shrieking sighing souls

     wailing whining whirling forms

     like the voice of vanished storms

     their despairing anthem rolls

     see them winding wo-bedight
     through the labyrinths of night
had often wondered why dr
ivan brodsky had never married
i had been associated with him in
numbers of those cases of psychical
investigation in which he had
brought relief and happiness to many
sufferers whose souls had capitulated
to evil forces i had heard him speak
of women constantly in terms of the
utmost reverence he had indeed
dimly hinted at some unforgotten
love episode in his own life but he
had never confided in me and of
course i forbore to question him it
was the merest accident-if indeed
anything be fortuitous-that re-
vealed to me the story

  we were sitting upon the veranda
of a summer hotel a little place in
the mountains to which we frequent-

  note-this is the tenth in a series of stories
each complete in itself dealing- with dr ivan
brodsky the surgeon of souls

ly journeyed to spend the week-end
one summer evening with us was a
stranger a man of rare personality
whom we had met the day before
and as is often the case we had dis-
cussed with him matters of belief and
conduct on which one is silent toward
acquaintances of long standing and
then came up the ever interesting
question of faith

  there is one thing that could give
me back my faith said the stranger
slowly i was married for twenty
years to a woman of the highest char-
acter we were supremely happy to-
gether i believe in her still as i once
believed in the consolations of reli-
gion yet my wife died without rec-
ognizing me calling upon the name
of some man whom i had neither seen
nor heard of restore to me my com-
plete confidence in her answer that
nameless question that will rise up in

weird tales

the depths of my consciousness and
i will believe again

 then somehow-i do not remem-
ber just the sequence of words that
led to it-brodsky was telling us his
story

	 t came to america when i was a
-i young man through all my
early struggles the friendship of one
woman sustained me i do not think
there has been a moment since i first
met her when i had not loved marion
strong but nothing was said it
was a quiet understanding that grew
up between us so that when the rup-
ture came there remained nothing
to be unsaid either marion explained
nothing of the trivial incident that
came to be an unbreakable barrier
between us that was her way mar-
ion was always proud if she had
been less proud our lives would have
been different

  i saw her only twice after her
marriage she still resided in bos-
ton where i was then in practise but
in a different quarter of the city i
had sought comfort in work and had
succeeded in some measure in finding
it when we met face to face in the
rose garden that adjoins the common
she stopped and spoke with me

   you are not looking well you
must take care of your health i
blurted out in the foolish manner of
friends long sundered who meet to
interchange only banalities

    the second meeting was at a din-
ner party and equally unsatisfactory
nothing of the old friendship seemed
to remain for me in that glance of
friendly indifference that word of
conventional greeting soon after-
ward i heard of her marriage her
health broke down they hurried her
to florida and she died there

 thank heaven for work it is
lifes anodyne i put her memory
out of my mind to the best of my
ability for i think only the senti-
mentalist weaves the silken threads

of longing around the cocoon of his
sorrow and then i had no right to
think of her i worked hard i had
already achieved some measure of
recognition in my profession when
the methods of the nancy school of
hypnotics were introduced into medi-
cal practise in this country so that it
was no longer considered the sign of
a charlatan to make use of them i
found that i possessed unusual facul-
ties for curing ailments of conscious-
ness and reviving lost personalities
by hypnotism one day a woman
called on me in company with a little
girl

    the child suffered from some
slight nervous ailment common
among girls of that period of life-
listlessness blue studies as the
laity calls fits of abstraction and
nervousness i prescribed some
childs remedy but when i came to
look into her pupils for the examina-
tion for just one fleeting instant the
eyes of marion seemed to look back
at me could it be anything but
hallucination marions eyes were
the most beautiful i have ever seen
in their intelligence their gray liquid
softness fearfully i looked again
but only the sleepy pupils of the ail-
ing child looked back at me

   i see you do not remember me
dr brodsky said the woman when
my investigation was ended never-
theless i know you well and i came
to see and consult you partly out of
interest do you not remember mar-
ion strickland

  i started involuntarily yes that
was the name of the man whom she
married this was a mrs strickland
who had brought the child to me she
was the second wife of marions hus-
band and this was her daughter my
heart leaped in my throat thank
god in this new marriage he had for-
gotten marion at last i might now
liave the right once more to turn my
thoughts upon her she was as much
mine as his
the dream that came true



   her end was curiously sudden
poor thing said the woman in gos-
siping fashion she died quite un-
expectedly you know

   yes i murmured though i had
been told nothing

   we thought it was nothing but
a congested chill until she died in
florida strangely too her last
words seemed to be about you we
fancied that she tried to leave some
message for you but we could not un-
derstand her it was some phase of
the delirium i suppose

  a new phase of my life opened
up on that day marion had thought
of me at the end then she had al-
ways loved me

  i might have known her better
than to have doubted that her love
could change that her married life
had been neither happy nor unhappy
i had suspected clearly this was not
one of those unions that seem to
transcend the limitations of our
mortality that are not severed by
death and at the end her thoughts
had turned back to me thencefor-
ward i had a new impulse of joy in
my work from that time too i be-
gan to look forward to the day when
much that is hidden from us will be
revealed and death will no longer
sever that was the beginning of my
psychical work

-phe years slipped by and found
me still steadily at work and
with an increasing amount of pa-
tients and of reputation i had sought
in vain to communicate with marion
through all the recognized mediums
though her inspiration remained
with me once again her outward
memory had grown weak

  one evening a young man called
upon me in my consulting room

   i do not see new patients i in-
formed him for at that time i had
already begun to withdraw from ac-
tive practise in preparation for the
professorship which had been offered

me for the succeeding year but he
was insistent it was not for him-
self he said that lie wished my ser-
vices but for his fiancee a girl of
twenty-five always liable since
childhood to nervous attacks of ob-
scure origin these had developed
during the past three months into fits
of imbecility during which she be-
came almost an automaton and mani-
fested the most extreme aversion for
him her friends and family had even
spoken of the necessity of placing her
in some institution unless she could
be cured he happened to have heard
of me would i assist him 

  the young mans earnestness his
solicitude for the girl impressed me
and i consented to take her case in
hand to my surprize i found that
my patient was none other than ethel
strickland the girl whom i had
treated some dozen years before i
looked long and i fear unprofes-
sionally to discover whether i could
discern marions unforgettable ex-
pression in the eyes but the heavy
pupils merely stared back at me list-
lessly and indolently they were not
marions as the young woman was
at that time in the enjoyment of nor-
mal health i left instructions that she
was to be brought to my office im-
mediately if a crisis occurred and i
went away

  it must have been two weeks
later just as i was about to close my
office and go to bed that a loiul peal
at the bell startled me the servants
having retired i opened the door in
person and ushered in the young
woman it had been raining hard
and her oiiter garments were soaked
with water she did not attempt to re-
move her coat however nor respond
to my proffered assistance but ad-
vanced into the center of the room
and stood staring at me blankly as
one bereft of reason

    i had seen similar cases previous-
ly and diagnosed it instantly as tem-
porary aberrancy of personality it


weird tales

was one of those rare eases in which
a portion of the consciousness be-
comes submerged so to speak leaving
the patient in forgetfulness as to the
most simple matters connected with
her daily life usually such cases
submit readily to mild hypnotic
treatment i placed miss strickland
under hypnosis to which she readily
yielded

   who are you i asked her

   why doctor i am ethel strick-
land she answered in some surprize
mixed with a slight resentment

   why have you come here

   doctor did you not leave in-
structions that i was to come to yoii
as soon as i experienced one of my
attacks 

  and all the while i was staring
into her eyes searching into the
depths of them but they were not
marions eyes

   you did quite right i answered
her you are well now you will
never have another of your attacks
wake up 

  instantly an expression of aston-
ishment passed over her features the
waking soul had no memory of what
had occurred during the period of
hypnosis she gave an exclamation
of fear then recognizing me seemed
reassured

   dr brodsky she exclaimed
where am i how did i come here

   you are quite safe i answered
you had one of your attacks and by
some providence wandered into my
office now i am going to take you
home 

 i escorted her to her house
where i found the family in a state
of alarm over the girls disappear-
ance they were grateful for her safe
return and especially that she was
again in her normal mind i depart-
ed assuring them that in the improb-
able event of any future attack i
could cure her

  and so convinced that my im-
pression as to the eyes had been a

hallucination i took up my work
once more but i was to see my pa-
tient again for a time the hypnotic
suggestion was effective then en-
sued one of those little lovers quar-
rels which are apt to occur among the
most devoted couples it was a triv-
ial matter enough and yet sufficient
in her weak state of mind to induce
in the young woman another of her
attacks one evening about the
same time as before i was again
about to close my office and retire
for the night when again the bell was
pulled and the girl entered in the
same dazed and perplexed condition
again i induced a slight state of
hypnosis and questioned her

   who are you i demanded
this time the young woman ap-
peared perfectly indignant

   are you trying to make a fool
of me dr brodsky she asked you
asked me that question not two
minutes ago and i have just told
you that i am ethel strickland
all her intermediate life had
been wiped out it was as though she
took up the threads of this personality
again where she had dropped them

   and you have come to me be-
cause you had another of your at-
tacks i queried

   precisely she replied

   at least you should have got
your fiance to escort you i rejoined
severely young ladies are not usu-
ally encouraged to go about at night
alone especially when in a distressed
condition of mind why did you not
ask his assistance

   because i hate him she replied
hysterically he persecutes me and
will not take no for an answer i
will never marry him-never i can
not endure the sight of him 

   and yet you engaged yourself
to him i answered

  she raised her hand to her fore-
head and appeared to ponder the
question threw her into a state of
terrible agitation the young fellow
the dream that came true



had told me that she hated him when
in her imbecile phase yet here she
was still hating him although i had
restored her faculties under hypnosis
it seemed to me that this confusion
was possibly due to an alternating
personality some deeper layer or
stratum of consciousness which was
endeavoring to thrust itself up into
the normal life i resolved there-
fore to make the hypnotic condition
more absolute

      sleep  i said passing my hand
over her eyes you have been dream-
ing  you have forgotten who you are
you are not ethel strickland sleep
-sleep and remember who are you
now

  slowly the eyes opened one
glance and i was reeling backward
seeking to steady myself by gripping
the edge of the study table for the
eyes were those of marion strong
clear and unclouded as on the day
when i had seen her in the rose
garden if i had not seen her for a
thousand years i could never forget
their beauty their quiet tenderness

  she looked into my own she
came toward me her arms out-
stretched her face alight with in-
effable happiness

   who am i she murmured
who should i be do you not know
me your love who waited for you
so long

    i could not speak silently i saw
her draw near a moment later and
i felt her arms enfold me as in a
dream through tear-dimmed eyes i
saw my head drooping in the mirror
on the wall i sank upon the lounge
and there we sat the living and the
dead stammering and babbling hap-
pily like two young lovers but lately
parted

   you have been gone so long
she said sometimes i have de-
spaired of ever seeing you again how
many many years it must be since
i began to fight my way upward
feeling at times that you were near

me the first time that i got my
eyes open i saw you through the body
of that girl i knew you remembered
me and ever since i have struggled
to overthrow her dominion that i
might see and be near you and at
last i have gained you

   i should have had you always if
i had not been so proud she whis-
pered  pride has ruined our lives do
you remember that day i met you in
the rose garden how i longed to
speak to you and could not conquer
myself and the next time at the din-
ner  i had to hasten away or i could
not have endured it but now i have
you with me my love forever-

vxhat answer i should have

  	 made seeing her appealing
eyes raised to mine i do not know
but at that instant a thunderous
knocking resounded on the front door
and the door bell rang furiously
with a mighty effort i tore myself
away

   wait for me i whispered
leaving her there and i went out at
the door stood the lover of the young
girl at sight of me he caught me by
the arm frantically

   she is here she is here he
cried thank god doctor i see it
in your face let me see her we
had a foolish quarrel we were both
equally to blame but she left me
later i hurried to her house and
found that she was not there they
hunted for her everywhere at last
somebody suggested that she might
have come to you let me take her
home 

   hush i answered she is not
herself she has had one of her at-
tacks it is more severe than before
i doubt-

   tell me that you can cure her
he cried i wavered my hellish de-
signs were torn to shreds in faee of
his earnest plea for after all this
was his own life and i had ruined


weird tales

mine so many years ago i led him
into a room adjacent to my study

   wait there i said perhaps
i can cure her but you must wait
patiently till i come out

   if you can cure her he said
solemnly i pledge my soul that i
will guard and protect her for the
whole of my life and hers

    then i went in i had half feared
that my absence would have driven
marion away but she sat there she
smiled up at me radiantly and all
my soul went out in a wild tumult
of desire and anguish

   i may stay with you forever
she whispered raising her lips to
mine you will not drive me away
back into the darkness again for
after all she is not really i-that girl
-you know 

  even then with all my soul given
to hers i heard the rapid tramp
tramp of the young man in the next
room if i yielded to her appeal if
we enjoyed the brief remaining span
of life together-what then what
would be the fruits of such stolen
happiness and i wept blinding
hopeless tears for i knew what i
must do marion knew too she
read it in my eyes her own took on
an anguished appeal that wrung my
heart

  listen marion i said we
have had our own lives to spend and
we have ruined them this life is
his he is waiting here for her to
come back to him it is his right
even then she did not plead that
was marions way if she had plead-
ed i could not have resisted

   and if i must go she mur-
mured what then what will be-
come of us when the weary travail of
this life is spent

   why i replied god has been
so good to us suppose we trust him
a little longei suppose we do right
and leave to him the judgment
she closed her eyes she leaned
closer to me in hopeless resignation

another moment and i must lose her
forever

   how shall i be certain after-
ward that i have really had you with
me i cried how shall i be sure
that this was not some frenzied
dream give me some sign or token
to remember

  once again she opened her eyes
and smiled at me do you remem-
ber the rose garden she asked soft-
ly be there tomorrow at noon and
i will give you what you ask for
once i kissed her upon the fore-
head in eternal farewell then i re-
called the sleeping soul of the girl
and when she opened her eyes they
were marions no longer she start-
ed up but i restrained her

   miss strickland you are safe
with me-dr brodsky i said reas-
suringly and i have cured you of
your attack you will never have an-
other so long as you live your
fiance is in the next room waiting
for you do you want to see him
i saw a girlish blush steal over
her cheeks there was no need of
answer wait for me and i will
bring him to you i said then i
went in to him

   i am going to give you back the
thing that you most desire in all the
world  i said placing my hand upon
his shoulder but before i do so-
have you forgotten your promise to
guard and care for her always

    i will  he cried and i knew by
his tone that his was no promise vain-
ly made or to be kept lightly

  forgive an older man for
preaching i said to him remem-
ber love is the noblest and the great-
est gift that god has given us it is
not lightly to be esteemed or easily
to be thrown away many have spok-
en one harsh word and atoned for it
through years of suffering come
then i led him in and when
they met i knew that i had not acted
wrongly when i made my sacrifice
the dream that came true



  next day at noon i was in the
rose garden that adjoins the common
it was july but a few blossoms still
lingered upon the trees deep in
earnest conversation they were saun-
 tering along the shadiest walk her
arm linked through his i would
have stepped aside but she saw and
beckoned to me

    doctor she said i can never
even try to thank you enough for
what you have done for me i know
last night i must have come to you
during my attack i do not remem-
ber that but i know you cured me
and i feel that this cure will last for
i have something to live for and to
remain well for she glanced at her
fiance shyly so as no words can
thank you i want to give you a little
memento of my gratitude she said
from the bosom of her gown she
pulled a solitary flower wear this
for my sake and in token of my
thanks she said

   i took the flower and fastened it
to my coat then feeling that her
gaze was bent upon mine i looked
up for one fleeting moment i
could see the soft tenderness of mar-
ions eyes then they were gone and

those of the young girl shone forth
happily i turned and went across
the common leaving them there she
married him soon after i believe but
i have never seen them since

neither of us had stirred while
brodsky told us his tale once
or twice i caught gleams of emotion
in the strangers eyes but we had
listened silently absorbed by the sim-
ple story and neither of us could
have been able to doubt it

  it had grown so late that even the
lights of the hotel had been extin-
guished the night air blew softly
upon us from the broad bosom of the
lake and seemed to bear upon its
breath some lingering odor of roses
the stranger rose came toward the
doctor and took him by both hands

 you have unwittingly given me
back my faith he said for i
know now who it was that my wife
called upon when she lay dying and
why and who it was that called you
gave her to me ivan brodsky have
you forgotten me

problem will be published in weird tales next

the land of
creeping death

    by edna bell seward

saxon ross and i had been
building bridges in burma for
the english government when
the task was finished we decided to
spend a three months vacation ex-
ploring the upper reaches of the sal-
ween river its source was in the
mountains of eastern tibet but the
region was an unexplored wilderness
above the burma line it was a deep
turbulent stream that flowed down
through the eastern part of burma
and eventually emptied its waters
into the bay of bengal we started
on our trip with perfect confidence
in our ability to chart the salweens
source

  naja our native servant cooked
our simple meals and took care of the
domestic end of our camp his one
great fear was that we would all be-
come meat for the man-eating tigers
which prowled in the forests

  late in the afternoon of the third
day of our journey saxon called my
attention to the wonderful parklike
forest on the opposite bank of the
river at that particular point the
salween flowed sluggishly between
gradually sloping hills and was only
fifty yards wide

  lets make a raft and cross over
for camp bryson-its beautiful over
there-hardly any undergrowth
thats surprizing too in this part of
the country

  im not surprized at anything in
this part of the country i said
peevishly as i fought the swarm of
 

mosquitoes circling around my head
-and then disproved my own words
almost instantly for naja pointed to
a small object floating in the sluggish
current and called sahib what is
that

  i looked at the thing as it slowly
drifted toward us it seems to be
a sun-helmet i said hesitatingly as
i watched it bobbing up and down
in the water i broke a long branch
from a tree beside me crawled out on
the end of a half-submerged log and
reached for the thing as it floated by
it was a sun-helmet-the kind white
men wear to protect themselves
against the sun of india

  who the deuce dos it belong
to asked saxon what is an
englishman doing in this wild coun-
try the owner must be english
for this has a london trademark in
it

  ask me something easy i said
as i examined the wet piece of can-
vas one thing is certain-it hasnt
been in the water very long some-
body else must be exploring the sal-
ween-whats that

  again it came-a faint shout-and
it sounded from the opposite side of
the river theres the owner i
laughed he wants his hat then
the smile left my face for the cry
came again it was closer and the
tones clearer

  saxon turned to me an incredulous
stare in his eyes by god bryson
if i didnt know such a thing was im-
the land of creeping death



 possible id say that was a womans
 voice

   again it came still nearer than be-
 fore-and there was no mistaking its
 accents father father answer
 me

  it was a woman-even as she
 wailed out her appeal she burst into
 view on the opposite bank from a
 thicket of trees father she
 called again then catching sight of
 us she stopped and clasped her
 hands over her heart

   dont be afraid i called

	were englishmen-may we help
 you in any way   

  oh if you would im so
 afraid she slumped down on the
 bank and covered her face with her
 hands

   well be right over-soon as we
 can fix up a raft i said and joined
 saxon and naja who were already
 prying out a couple of logs from the
 mud of the bank and rolling them
 into the water she took her hands
 from her face and watched us

   when we stepped from the raft on
 her side of the river she stood up and
 gave us a long appraising glance
 we also studied her with undisguised
 curiosity-wondering what a well-
 bred english girl was doing in that
 wilderness her skin was browned
 by the sun her gray eyes were large
 but they were full of tears i noticed
 she was trying to keep her lips from
 quivering while she twisted them into
 a smile of welcome

   what is troubling you i asked
 my friend and i are exploring the
 river-but may i know what you are
 doing in this wilderness

  i came with father her
 steady voice broke on the word but
 she bravely swallowed a sob and con-
 tinued i am naomi harcourt my
 father is professor harcourt of lan-
 caster university theres a species
 of lizard father has been studying
 that makes its home along the banks
 of this river we have been up here

a month the other day our native
guide slipped from a rock into the
salween and was drowned since
then father and i have been entirely
alone last night we camped in that
ravine back there pointing behind
her to the thin woods this morn-
ing i was tired so father went out
for his daily specimen hunt by him-
self he always comes back to rest
at noon-i am afraid something
dreadful has happened to him  

  she was frankly crying by the
time she finished and saxons eyes
met mine significantly i knew he
was thinking of the sun-helmet we
had found floating in the salween-
and i breathed a prayer of thankful-
ness that it had been left on the op-
posite bank along with the bulk of
our luggage saxon tried to reassure
her-but to one who knew him well
his voice did not ring true prob-
ably miss harcourt your father has
simply lost his way and will come
walking into camp any minute now
if you like we will keep you com-
pany until he turns up

  his words comforted her and she
dried her eyes as she sighed oh
if you would

  then i broke in its the most
fortunate thing in the world that we
ran across you

  isnt it she said in a relieved
tone father insisted this country
was no place for me and didnt want
me to come-but i have always
traveled with him since mother
died

  i encouraged her to talk-it re-
lieved the nervous tension under
which she was laboring while she
chatted we walked toward the ravine
where their camp was pitched and
soon we saw the gleam of the two
small tents beneath the trees it was
an ideal camping spot a winding
stream made a sharp-pointed penin-
sula out of a small cool glade but
despite its seeming security i recalled
the tales i had been told of the tigers


weird tales

that infested the forest-covered hills
in that district

  i wondered at her dreamy imbecile
father-for he must be an imbecile to
bring a woman into such a country
and then leave her unprotected for
even an hour blit i remembered the
sun-helmet we had taken from the
water and my heart softened poor
devil i knew he was at the bottom
of the salween no human being un-
aided could struggle out of the
streams swift current-its undertow
was relentless

  but we did not dare tell naomi
harcourt that we decided it would
be a kindness to wait until morning-
she looked so worried and tired be-
sides her trustful eyes had made a
strong appeal to my rather phlegmat-
ic emotions she seemed so confident
of our ability to take care of her i
registered a vow in my heart that she
should not find her confidence mis-
placed but it was no light task to
keep her mind free from worry over
her missing father however we did
our best while naja cooked the even-
ing meal

  afterward we sat around the camp-
fire chatting and discovering mutual
acquaintances back in london she
laughed often at our jokes-delicious
peals of laughter that showed the
dimple in her left cheek and the
perfect whiteness of her teeth be-
fore it was time to retire we were
all her willing slaves-even naja re-
spectfully worshiping the white
memsaliib at a distance she was
singularly fi-ee from all feminine af-
fectation and it hurt deep in the bet-
ter part of our souls when she ac-
cepted so trustingly our theory that
her father had simply lost his way
and would come back into camp in
the morning

  her faith in us sent her smilingly
to her small sleeping tent and i was
glad when saxon allowed me to take
the first watch without protest he
took himself and his shamed

troubled eyes away to the professors
small tent where naja was already
curled up on the ground before its
entrance

iwas glad to be alone-i wanted to
smoke and think of naomis eyes
and wish i had the right to take her
in my arms and comfort her when the
first wave of grief over her fathers
death should flood her soul she was
the type of woman men instinctively
wish to protect and i sat for a long
time over the dying fire thinking of
her gray eyes

  i refilled my pipe and then leaned
back against a tall tree trunk my re-
peating rifle across my knees saxon
and i always took turns watching
throughout the night in that wild
country it had grown very still-
the moon came up and flooded the
open space around the camp with
silver the only sound that reached
my ears was the murmur of the
stream as it crept through the low
undergrowth in the ravine on its
way to the river

  as i leaned against the tree my
back was toward the stream that
circled the land behind me sudden-
ly i heard a soft splash in the water
i turned quickly and caught a vague
glimpse of a naked human form
creeping toward me i aimed my
rifle and fired instantly blood-curd-
ling yells came from all sides of the
glade and a horde of black gleaming
bodies swarmed into view

  i emptied my gun among them-
the chance to protect naomi har-
court had come the black oiled
bodies of the advancing men did not
look like shan natives their gleam-
ing eyeballs and flashing teeth as
they yelled their war-cry gave them
the appearance of demons spawned
in the darkness of the forest

  my gun had done such execution
among them that only two had
crossed the stream when saxon leaped
from the tent and his rifle caused
the land of creeping death



another halt during that pause
naomi flew across the open space to-
ward me she looked like a dryad in
her long white night-robe with her
thick hair loose over her shoulders

  at the sight of her a hoarse shout
went up from the blacks and they
surged forward again i swung her
behind me and lifted my rifle which
i had loaded while saxon held them
at bay when i finished the task my
cartridge belt was empty-and our
extra ammunition was with our camp
supplies on the farther bank of the
salween

  naja was kneeling beside saxon
wailing shoot sahib ross shoot
to kill-they are the wa people on
a head-hunting raid

   i noted then for the first time that
the black men had no firearms they
took our deadly rifle fire coolly clos-
ing their depicted ranks with the
seemingly endless swarm of men be-
hind they carried long wicked-
looking machetes in their hands but
they seemed determined to overpower
us by the weight of their numbers

  at najas wailing words saxon
stepped closer to my side-speech
was not necessary between us we
formed a wall with our bodies be-
tween the slender helpless white girl
and ie horde of blacks that had
glimpsed her beauty in the moon-
light we had heard of the wa peo-
ple and knew of their impregnable
villages in the highlands on the east-
ern side of the salween for years
they had defied all efforts of the brit-
ish government to civilize them

   they were a tribe that believed the
ghost of a dead man lingered in his
skull and would keep away the in-
visible demons of the air from their
villages and lands every year they
sent out a head-hunting expedition to
obtain fresh skulls-as they believed
at seeding time the demons were most
active and would bewitch the seed
and the soil their cultivated lands
were surrounded by rows of posts

hung with human skulls their vil-
lage streets were ornamented the
same wav the peaceful shan natives
called the wa territory the land of
creeping death so i understood
saxons meaning when he said grim-
ly save a bullet for naomi

  even in the stress of that moment
i noticed that he also thought of her
by her first name as i drew a bead
on a swarthy brute i caught a glimpse
of swaying underbrush at the right-
some of them had managed to cross
the stream very deep at that point
and were trying to attack us in the
rear i left the ugly beast in front
of me to saxon and swung around in
time to fire at two oily bodies break-
ing through the underbrush almost
behind us

  naomi saw them at the same time
she rose from her crouching posture
and i felt har slender hands at my
holster the next instant she was
clutching my revolver her body
swayed against me making my heart
jump i dared not take my eyes
from that swaying mass of shrubbery
where the blacks-were concealed but
i sensed her glorious womanhood-
her appealing helplessness and i
shivered as i pictured the inevitable
end of the conflict no three men
could long withstand that writhing
screaming yet steadily advancing
horde we must soon be swept into
oblivion by the very weight of their
numbers

   saxons repeating rifle was spitting
sullenly beside me his cartridge belt
was half full so i reloaded my gun
while he cursed the cringing front
ranks of blacks damn you take
that he snarled-his rifle barked
and a black body bounded into the
air and fell forward to be tramples
by the advancing lines behind

  then naomi screamed i took my
eyes from the swaying bushes at my
right in time to see a score of the
demons closing in from the left i
fired desperately among them but a


weird tales

close whiff of rancid grease made me
turn to the right again a naked
oily native was standing beside me
with gleaming machete raised to
strike a revolver shot sent him
sprawling-it was naomi she had
saved me from butchery for the mo-
ment but my rifle was empty-so
was saxons i used mine as a club
on a screaming brute who reached for
the girl as lie went down i dodged
a shining blade and brought the butt
of my gun down on the arm holding
the machete

  again naomi fired i yelled   save
a bullet for yourself but she did
not hear me i caught a glimpse of
her set white face as she stood with
her back to the tree firing telling
shots naja was trying to protect her
with the small dagger he carried i
saw him sink it into the throat of a
squat beast who grabbed at her hair
i yelled encouragement and he
screamed back a prayer to the
heathenish god he worshiped

  i heard saxon cursing his maker
as he struggled fruitlessly to reach
naomis side i swung my clubbed
gun in a vicious circle but the stock
snapped on a thick skull hands
reached for me-i saw black fingers
tearing the white robe from naomis
shoulders the sight made me fran-
tic-her eyes were set in dull horror
as she fought the big beast who was
tearing her clothing

  my bellow of rage was answered by
saxons-he had glimpsed the same
scene then i smashed the arm of
a howling fiend snatched his machete
and swung around to the girls de-
fense i saw saxon go down beneath
a wave of screaming savages-i saw
naja sobbing with anger as he fought
against the firm grip of two naked
blacks-and all the time the maehete
in my hands rose and fell in the
midst of that pressing circle step
by step i advanced through a veri-
table river of blood to the spot where
the girl had fallen senseless at the

foot of the tree i was glad she was
unconscious it would be harder to
run that reddened blade through her
heart while her terrified eyes were on
my face

  a glancing blow on the back of my
head staggered me-hands pulled at
my legs and arms but i threw them
off i knew i had to die and there
was one earthly task i must finish
first i must run that machete
through naomis heart-she must
not be left to that horde of savages

  i reached her side-she lay white
and still at my feet-for a fleeting
instant i allowed myself to think how
lovely she was-then i sternly put
the thought away i gritted my teeth
-forcing my cringing hands to
direct the blade toward her hearts
then a crashing blow on my head sent
me reeling headlong and blackness
enveloped the world

the weird persistent beating of a
drum was the first impression
my brain registered when i returned
to consciousness i opened my eyes
and found myself staring at a row of
grinning skulls suspended from the
ceiling of a high thatched roof there
was a movement beside me-i blinked
and stared wonderingly naomi was
bending over me and the light in her
gray eyes sent a thrill through my
veins then i heard saxons voice
bryson old chap how do you
feel

  his face came within my range of
vision and i saw a bandage was
around his temples-i recognized it
as part of the shirt he had been wear-
ing on the day we met naomi sud-
denly the fight in the glade came back
to me i raised up and immediately
clutched my aching head with both
hands and discovered it also was
bandaged

  after my vision cleared i looked
about me we were in a large bare
hut with rush-woven walls and a
the land of creeping death



high thatched roof rows of grin-
ning skulls hung from the ceiling
and the air was heavy with the fetid
odor of decaying flesh i brought my
gaze back to saxons face and he
nodded to the question he saw in my
eyes

  yes we are prisoners in a wa vil-
lage i dont know why we were not
killed at once-naja said there is
something in their religious belief
that makes it necessary for them to
take their victims alive he stopped
and my eyes followed his to the dis-
tant spot where naomi had with-
drawn she was trying to fasten her
torn gown on the shoulder

  where is naja i asked

  i dont know they took him
away a while ago-he understands
their lingo and has already learned
that the fight we put up places us
high in their estimation god knows
how many devils we killed-you did
fine work with that machete bryson
they pulled me down and then fell
over me so fast i was not seriously
hurt-but we thought you were dead
-one of the brutes hit you with a
heavy club

  and naomi i asked

  is uninjured-so far he add-
ed the last in a low voice i saw
you trying to reach her with the
machete he went on in a whisper
god knows it would have been bet-
ter-now we are weaponless and
when we entered the village i saw
their king looking at her-

  he stopped and gritted his teeth
i glanced over at naomi she had
turned away until only her profile
showed in the dark room it looked
pure high-bred delicate a wave of
physical nausea went over me as i
mentally pictured that brute of a wa
king feasting his eyes on her ill
kill her with my bare hands first
i whispered fiercely and he nodded
approval-which showed that his
thoughts had been following my own

as the day drew to a close food
was placed before us by silent
curious-eyed women the guards
laughed and joked while they lounged
on the hard earth before the open
door occasionally they peered in at
us and we saw the murderous-looking
machetes at their belts eventually
darkness fell as the room grew black
naomi crept closer to my side when
loud voices sounded near she groped
for my hand i heard her sigh con-
tentedly when my fingers closed over
hers she did not know how madly
the blood was coursing in my veins at
the touch of her soft palm-how the
fragrant nearness of her made me
forget for moments at a time that we
all must die-for there was no escape

  saxon had explained that the walls
of the village were constructed like a
fort it was situated on a high hill
surrounded by a deep ditch over
which a drawbridge was built the
only approach was over that draw-
bridge and through a winding tunnel
that led upward to the inner ram-
parts this tunnel was heavily guard-
ed and the houses of the tribe were
built inside the fort around the huge
sun-burnt square i had glimpsed
through the doorway

  naomi broke a long silence by say-
ing mx ross has told me that you
found fathers helmet in the sal-
ween i know he is dead-but it is
much better for him than this   her
voice broke and the next moment i
pulled her gently into my arms and
she was sobbing on my breast the
room was utterly black but i knew
saxon realized naomi was in my
arms-that it was i to whom she had
turned for comfort

  hours passed naomi cried herself
to sleep on my shoulder-then sud-
denly i heard heavy breathing be-
hind me its quality chilled my
heart-it sounded like a wounded
animal fighting the death-rattle i
suffered agony as i listened-even
while some instinct kept me motion-


weird tales

less holding my breath saxon must
have been dozing for he did not
move until a faint whisper came
sahibs sahibs are you there

  it was naja-i heard the slight
rustling of the leaves on the floor as
he dragged himself through the loose
rushes of the huts side and crept to-
ward us-guided by our low whis-
pers occasionally a moan escaped
him and i knew by his fearful breath-
ing that he was mortally hurt at
his first low words i was thankful
the girl in my arms was sleeing the
sleep of utter exhaustion and could
not hear sahibs there is no hope
-you die tomorrow when the noon
sun shines down over the new rice-
field it has just been cleared of the
jungle vines ready to be flooded for
the planting your blood is to be
sprinkled over the ground and your
heads go on the posts

  but the memsahibi broke in
what are their plans for her

  the rattle in his throat grew loud-
er she goes to the king-when i
heard i tried to steal a dagger to
bring to her-they caught me i was
beaten and left for dead they threw
my body aside for the head mans
knife but i regained my senses and
dragged myself here-to-warn-i

choke-sahibs-i- 

  there was a long struggling breath
then silence

  i heard saxon moving in the dark-
ness and i knew he was feeling for
najas pulse after a while i heard
him sobbing hes dead bryson
ive been feeling his body-one leg
is broken and lies been hacked fear-
fully with machetes yet he dragged

himself here to warn us- his

voice broke and there was silence

  my own eyes were wet as i recalled
that naja was a heathen who wor-
shiped idols of stone-but i did not
fear for the soul that had just taken
flight from his tortured body

daylight found us wan-eyed and
despairing the precious bur-
den on my breast grew doubly dear
as the hour approached when i must
send her soul to her maker undefiled
saxon and i could face death with
stoicism-but we could not leave
naomi for the wa king yet my
heart recoiled from the task i had set
myself to perform-cowardlike i put
off the moment as long as possible

  she opened her eyes as i gazed
longingly into her face the guards
outside the open door were being
changed and the sound of their voices
awakened her saxon had drawn
najas body into the huts darkest
corner and covered it with leaves
with which the floor was plentifully
sprinkled then he sat with liis back
turned so that i could have those
precious last moments alone with the
girl i loved time passed-we heard
shouting and laughter outside in the
square-yet still naomi lived-the
longer i gazed into her sweet gray
eyes the weaker grew my will   just
a little more time i would whisper
to my fainting spirit just a little
more time-then i will take this
bandage from my head fasten it
around her white throat and twist it
until she is dead i must do it-
there is no other way  

  but when i looked at her white
neck and pulsing throat i turned
craven if only i had a gun or a
knife it would be easier-but to tor-
ture her

  suddenly the guards came through
the door and ordered us by gestures
out into the street then it was too
late for they bound my hands be-
hind me at the last moment curs-
ing myself for a coward i tried to
snatch one of their machetes and run
it through her heart-but they beat
me down and took the weapon from
my frenzied hands

  saxon spoke on the way out you
couldnt do it bryson-neither could
the land op creeping death



i we are eowards-may god for-
give us

  naomi walked between two black
brutes who held her arms in a viselike
grip we crossed a square between
rows of gaping natives passed
through a wide gate in the ramparts
descended a hill and found ourselves
in a large cultivated valley at one
side of this valley was a tract of new-
ly cleared land some ten acres wide
and we reached it by a street lined
with high posts each holding a grin-
ning skull

  we found the king and his attend-
ants beneath a large tree on the edge
of the newly cleared land-he was
seated in a bamboo litter held by four
slaves i did not feel as a man ought
to feel who is going to die-i was not
thinking of myself at all but of
naomi and when i saw the salacious
light in the wa kings eyes i cursed
the weakness that kept me from
strangling her to death he was a
fat ugly brute and when naomi was
brought before him she screamed and
shrank away as he reached out a paw
and touched her arm

  saxon went white at that scream
and strained frantically at his bonds
i went mad-a bestial madness that
sent me charging head-first like an
angry bull at that bundle of reeking
flesh in the bamboo litter i reached
him just as he rose to pull naomi
forcibly toward him and my head
landed forcibly in his greasy paunch
lie grunted and fell over backward in
the litter

  then i was grabbed by my angry
guards and hurried out into the cen-
ter of the huge sun-baked field and
bound securely to a post saxon was
fastened to a similar one a few feet
away the blazing sun beat fiercely
in my eyes my head ached from the
force with which i had driven it into
the kings greasy paunch i could
see naomi lying a crumpled heap of
white beneath the tree beside the
kings litter she had fainted and

i prayed desperately that she would
never open her eyes again

  i saw two natives coming toward
us with gleaming machetes in their
hands i knew  had but a few sec-
onds to live at such tense moments
it is surprizing what small things at-
tract ones attention i could not
think of my coming death for my
mind was obsessed with the hum-
ming of an insect-a bee evidently-
that i could hear buzzing behind me

  it droned again and i turned my
head to see how close it was to my
ear the sun was pouring into my
eyes and for a moment i thought i
had gone mad then the droning be-
gan again and after another glance
at the heavens i gave a shout   sax-
on look-an airplane

  the wa king saw it at the same
time-he gave one shriek of fear as
he leaped from the litter and ran for
the safety of his fortification on the
hill his people followed screaming
frantically with terror

after the big military machine
landed and saxon and i were be-
ing freed from our bonds by the lieu-
tenant in charge he said i knew
something was wrong when i spied
that bunch of natives through my
field-glasses luckily for you my
pilot was flying low hunting for a
landing place so he could tighten up
our steering gear

  as soon as my arms were free i
hurried across the field to naomi-
still a quiet huddled heap beneath
the tree she opened her eyes as i
lifted her into the cockpit of the fly-
ing machine then she shrank closer
into my arms as she realized her
scant attire the lieutenant handed
me his coat and once wrapped in its
protecting folds she sat up and
listened with interest to his explana-
tion of his presence in that territory
at such an opportune time it seemed
that he was on an experimental trip
from calcutta to canton china to

two on that stronghold of devils it

  the big machine roared over the
ground and took the air like a great
bird the others peered curiously
down as we passed over the village
on the hill i peered down too-but
not at the wa people i was gazing
into the eyes of the girl i loved while
she smiled up at me from the shelter
of my breast

sorcery past
and present

by marguerite lynch addis

brought up to date by some
unprejudiced historian the an-
nals of sorcery might perhaps
include names surprizing to the aver-
age reader the world however now
considers itself grown up and a large
number of taxpayers who in earlier
days would have been seized as sor-
cerers and escorted to the stake there
to become a total loss are now tol-
erantly relegated to whichever of the
various ologies and isms they seem to
belong and allowed to flourish or not
as circumstances and the finances of
their clients permit

  this is a very different state of af-
fairs from the eager credulity which
led to so many witch-burnings in the
middle ages or the pitiable materi-
alism of a later date which explained
the unexplainable by the rather feeble
assertion that it didnt exist and
which smugly dismissed quite cred-

ible evidence to the contrary as evi-
dence of drunkenness lunacy-or
anything in short except evidence of
things beyond its philosophy - and
which rather suggested the bluster
which struggles to camouflage fear

  but even in the days when astrol-
ogy palmistry crystal-gazing - all
the means of divination-were re-
garded as sorcery and quite as com-
promising as direct connivance with
beelzebub and when an accusation
of dabbling in these mysteries often
meant death then as now people
hurried to consult their favorite sor-
cerer only they went at night us-
ually

  whether or not the famous sor-
cerers of history really possessed the
powers credited to them they all seem
to have fallen down lamentably in re-
spect of defending themselves or
even of avoiding a painful and igno-
sorcery past and present



minious death nor was sorcery in
high life more innocuous to its dev-
otees than to humbler persons

  gilles de retz or de rais one-time
marshal of france and commander
in the field with joan of arc iost his
life on this account although his high
connections used their influence to en-
sure the more dignified charge of
heresy against him

  outwardly a devout dignitary of
the church he was said to practise
the black art privately and is some-
times mentioned as the original of
bluebeard but except for the color
of his beard which actually appeared
blue in certain lights there is little
in history to identify him with that
alarming gentleman his reputed
victims were not a succession of beau-
teous but sadly inquisitive brides but
innocent infants whose blood he re-
quired in his scientific researches for
the elixir of life s r crockett has
given a vivid picture of him in his
novel the black douglas which is
based on this sanguinary legend it
is related that gilles de retz caused
to be kidnaped and murdered more
than eight hundred children the dis-
covery of whose bones in a tower of
his chateau at champtoce ultimately
led to his conviction mr crockett
tells us that werewolves aided de
retz in these nocturnal kidnapings
resuming their normal form of ser-
vants at the chateau during the day-
time

  apropos of this elliott odonnell
in his book on werewolves gives di-
rections for the attaining of lycan-
thropy or werewolfery he quotes
the proper incantation in full and
the ingredients for the enchanted
salve to be rubbed on the body of the
candidate and even the locality most
favorable for the ceremony where
wolves abound one might experiment
with this curious spell but in the
event of success the appearance of a
lone wolf in a district hitherto free

of them might be productive of un-
pleasant consequences

  returning to gilles de retz read-
ers of the white company will re-
member that the wife of the french
warrior du guesclin the lady ti-
phaine foretold the future of the
young sir nigel in one of her pro-
phetic trances this lady known to
her contemporaries as a fairy wo-
man by right of these trances and
other supernormal traits was an an-
cestress of gilles de retz

  in the year  de retz was
hanged - some say burned - at
nantes after a full confession later
it was officially stated that he was in-
nocent of the crimes imputed to him
and his memory reinstated but public
opinion remained prejudiced against
him and in any case it was a little
late for de retz to profit much by it

  others even more highly placed
were not more fortunate the earl
of mar a brother of james iii of
scotland was accused of employing
the arts of witches and sorcerers to
shorten the kings days and he was
summarily bled to death in his own
apartment without even the sem-
blance of a trial

  janet douglas ladv glamis also
suffered for the same offense and was
executed in  glamis castle
now belonging to the family of the
duchess of york has ever been the
scene of weird happenings and its
very walls are saturated with legend
apparitions are legion there it is
only reasonable to suppose that the
ill-fated janet douglas stalks among
them

  the fate of the witches and sor-
cerers with whom these two luckless
plotters connived is unknown we are
free to assume that they were per-
haps so fortunate as to die in their
beds

  it seems not to have occurred to our
forebears that magic other than the
strictly divinatory kind could be
used for any other purpose than the

confusion of their enemies by which
they themselves often benefited so
obviously that there was not much
hope of concealing their connection
with it it is scarcely to be wondered
at that magicians practised their art
by stealth and shivered even if they
did not blush to find it fame cer-
tainly one does not hear much of
either witches or sorcerers being feted
or entertained in a social sense until
a much later period

toward the middle of the eight-
eenth century the comte st
germain was to dazzle a sophisti-
cated paris not alone with his magi-
cal mysteries but with his social fas-
cinations old enough to have known
better if we credit his assertion that
he had lived two thousand years by
the aid of his secret elixir of life
he allowed himself to become a lounge
lizard at the court of lotus xv of
france where he was spoiled by
ladies acclaimed by the intelligentsia
as master-musician and linguist and
entrusted with secret missions by the
king himself the comte was in de-
mand too with the alchemists who
sought to learn his secret process of
removing flaws from diamonds and
of transmuting the baser metals into
gold if lie had contented himself
with his brilliant social successes and
the beauty salves and pastes which
the fair ladies of the court lauded as
youth-renewing he might have mani-
fested the ability of at least one sor-
cerer to keep out of trouble wiz-
ards however seem unable to keep
out of politics and the accomplished
comte was no exception and was
obliged to flee to england in  in
consequence according to his pupil
the no less famous balsamo or ca-
gliostro he founded freemasonry in
germany after a prolonged visit to
russia the landgrave charles of
hesse studied secret sciences under
him he is said to have died at
schleswig near the end of the eight-

eenth century but people solemnly
swore to having seen him in paris as
late as  he maintained to the
end the mystery of his origin nor
can authorities agree to this day
whether he was italian spanish or
polish

  of his pupil cagliostro more is
definitely known it is pretty well
established that he was born at pa-
lermo in  although he like the
comte st germain claimed to have
lived many centuries by the use of
the elixir of life dumas novel
memoirs of a physician is based on
his life and dumas makes of him a
fascinating figure sinister but the
reverse of ignoble the novelist of
course took liberties with facts but
he represents the sorcerer as ex-
tremely handsome and of extraordin-
ary cultivation his wife lorenza
feliciani is also considerably white-
washed by dumas if we may believe
the historians who between them
have not left the poor woman a shred
of character although they all con-
cede her remarkable beauty

  carlyle calls the sorcerer a   dusky
bull-necked mastiff-faced sinister-
looking individual with a greasy
prophetic bulldog face according
to him cagliostro was a supremely
vulgar charlatan given credence only
by the most ignorant but it is diffi-
cult to reconcile this description of
him with the undoubted vogue he had
for a long time among people more
than a little fastidious carlyle in
his miscellanies gives a detailed ac-
count of the diamond necklace affair
in which cagliostro was implicated
and which caused the hapless marie
antoinette so much anguish he
also could not keep his fingers out
of politics and it was this together
with his attempts to establish what
he called egyptian freemasonry
that finally led to his imprisonment
in the bastille where he was sepa-
rated from his wife by only a few
cells although neither was aware of
sorcery past and present





this circumstance later in en-
gland he was moved to write his fa-
mous letter in which he declared that
frenchmen needed only one thing to
make them the most favored of man-
kind this one thing was he ex-
plained the certainty of sleeping un-
molested in their beds when they were
innocent he became the fashion in
england as in france his love
philters beauty lotions and predic-
tions many of which were fulfilled
caused his house to be besieged at ail
hours of the day and night and
whenever he showed himself he was
sure of an ovation all this did not
prevent his book on egyptian free-
masonry from being publicly burnt
and he finally died a prisoner in the
fortress-prison of st leo in 

  it is refreshing to turn to a magi-
cian who with a little license may
almost be called a contemporary
since he died as late as  and-
unique distinction-died in his own
bed in his own home at the very
hour foretold by himself

  cunning murrell of hadleigh
england was the seventh son of a
seventh son and on these grounds
alone according to his biographer
arthur morrison would have felt
justified in considering himself a born
sorcerer he had however a very
complete system of divination in
which lie himself implicitly believed
and when the exercise of his law-
ful magic arts his own expression
once resulted in the unexpected ex-
posure of his own daughter as the
witch who had been causing trouble
to the animal and human population

of hadleigh he seems to have enter-
tained no question of his own infal-
libility as a wizard but at once pro-
ceded to exorcise the unfortunate
lady twenty-five years ago cunning
murrells son was living and very
willing to tell what he knew of his
fathers powers which were still
deeply venerated in hadleigh

  the late lord lytton could have
in all modesty styled himself a sor-
cerer by ancient standards and in
certain of his writings especially
the house and the brain  he allows
some of his magical erudition to leak
out sax rohmers book the ro-
mance of sorcery crowns several
hitherto unsuspected persons with
sorcerous laurels

  from all of which it may be con-
cluded that sorcery is a much less
dangerous art than formerly and
also much more lucrative edicts of
louis xiv of france and george ii
of england abolished all criminal
procedure on the subject of sorcery
and witchcraft in their dominions
which was undoubtedly the beginning
of brighter days for the sorcerers

  that these particular days are still
brighter for them none can doubt
who read the personal columns of the
newspapers and even if we no longer
stick pins in the wax effigies of our
enemies for their undoing or direct
the evil eye upon our neighbors
livestock there are few of us who can
conscientiously affirm that they have
never bribed a modern sorcerer to lift
the veil of the future for us-and is
not this the very essence of sorcery

the song of triumphant love

by ivan turgenieff

  this is what  read in an old ital-
ian manuscript



about the middle of the six-
teenth century there were

l	living in ferrara it was at
that time flourishing under the scep-
ter of its magnificent archdukes the
patrons of the arts and poetry two
young men named fabio and muz-
zio they were of the same age and
of near kinship and were scarcely
ever apart the warmest affection
had united them from early child-
hood    the similarity of their posi-
tions strengthened the bond both be-
longed to old families both were
rich independent and without fam-
ily ties tastes and inclinations were
alike in both muzzio was devoted
to music fabio to painting they
were looked upon with pride by the
whole of ferrara as ornaments of
the court society and town in ap-
pearance however they were not
alike though both were distin-
guished by a graceful youthful
beauty fabio was taller fair of
face and flaxen of hair and he had
blue eyes muzzio on the other hand
had a swarthy face and black hair
and in his dark brown eyes there
was not the merry light nor on his
lips the genial smile of fabio his
thick eyebrows overhung narrow
eyelids while fabios golden eye-
brows formed delicate half-circles on
his pure smooth brow in conver-
sation too muzzio was less animat-

  	translated from the russian

    

ed for all that the two friends
were both alike looked on with fa-
vor by ladies as well they might
be being models of chivalrous court-
liness and generosity

  at the same time there was living
in ferrara a girl named valeria she
was considered one of the greatest
beauties in the town though it was
very seldom possible to see her as
she led a retired life and never went
out except to church and on great
holidays for a walk she lived with
her mother a widow of noble family
though of small fortune who had no
other children in everyone whom
valeria met she inspired a sensation
of involuntary admiration and an
equally involuntary tenderness and
respect so modest was her mien so
little it seemed was she aware of all
the power of her own charms some
it is true found her a little pale her
eyes almost always downcast ex-
pressed a certain shyness even
timidity her lips rarely smiled and
then only faintly her voice scarcely
anyone had heard but the rumor
went that it was most beautiful and
that shut up in her own room in the
early morning when everything still
slumbered in the town she loved to
sing old songs to the sound of the
lute on which she used to play her-
self in spite of her pallor valeria
was blooming with health and even
old people as they gazed on her
could not but think oh how happy
the youth for whom that pure maid-
en bud still enfolded in its petals
will one day open into full flower
the song op triumphant love





cabio and muzzio saw valeria for
the first time at a magnificent
public festival celebrated at the
command of the archduke of fer-
rara ercol son of the celebrated lu-
crezia borgia in honor of some il-
lustrious grandees who had come
from paris on the invitation of the
archduchess daughter of the french
king louis xii valeria was sitting
beside her mother on an elegant trib-
une built after a design of palladio
in the principal square of ferrara
for the most honorable ladies in the
town both fabio and muzzio fell
passionately in love with her on that
day and as they never had any se-
crets from each other each of them
soon knew what was passing in his
friends heart they agreed togeth-
er that both should try to get to
know valeria and if she should
deign to choose one of them the
other should submit without a mur-
mur to her decision a few weeks
later thanks to the excellent renown
they deservedly enjoyed they suc-
ceeded in penetrating into the wid-
ow s house difficult though it was to
obtain an entry to it she permitted
them to visit her from that time
forward they were able almost every
day to see valeria and to converse
with her and every day the passion
kindled in the hearts of both young
men grew stronger and stronger
valeria however showed no prefer-
ence for either of them though their
society was obviously agreeable to
her with muzzio she occupied her-
self with music but she talked more
with fabio with him she was less
timid at last they resolved to learn
once for all their fate and sent a let-
ter to valeria in which they begged
her to be open with them and to say
to which she would be ready to give
her hand valeria showed this letter
to her mother and declared that she
was willing to remain unmarried but
if her mother considered it time for

her to enter into matrimony then
she would marry whichever one her
mothers choice should fix upon the
excellent widow shed a few tears at
the thought of parting from her be-
loved child there was however no
good ground for refusing the suitors
she considered both of them equally
worthy of her daughters hand but
as she secretly preferred fabio and
suspected that valeria liked him the
better she fixed upon him the next
day fabio heard of his happy fate
while all that was left for muzzio
was to keep his word and submit

  and this he did but to be the wit-
ness of the triumph of his friend and
rival was more than he could do he
promptly sold the greater part of his
property and collecting some thou-
sands of ducats he set off on a far
journey to the east as he said fare-
well to fabio he told him that he
should not return till he felt that the
last traces of passion had vanished
from his heart it was painful to
fabio to part from the friend of his
childhood and youth  but the
joyous anticipation of approaching
bliss soon swallowed up all other sen-
sations and he gave himself up
wholly to the transports of success-
ful love

  shortly after he celebrated his
nuptials with valeria and only then
learnt the full worth of the treasure
it had been his fortune to obtain he
had a charming villa shut in by a
shady garden a short distance from
ferrara he moved thither with his
wife and her mother then a time
of happiness began for them mar-
ried life brought out in a new and
enchanting light all the perfections
of valeria fabio became an artist
of distinction-no longer a mere
amateur but a real master valerias
mother rejoiced and thanked god as
she looked upon the happy pair

  four years flew by unperceived
like a delicious dream one thing
only was wanting to the young
weird tales

couple one lack they mourned over
as a sorrow they had no children
  hut they had not given up all
hope of them at the end of the
fourth year they were overtaken by
a great this time a real sorrow va-
lerias mother died

  many tears were shed by valeria
for a long time she could not accus-
tom herself to her loss but another
year went by life again asserted its
lights and flowed along its old chan-
nel and behold one fine summer
evening unexpected by everyone
muzzio returned to ferrara



t-uring the whole space of five
years that had elapsed since his
departure no one had heard any-
thing of him all talk about him had
died away as though he had van-
ished from the face of the earth
when fabio met his friend in one of
the streets of ferrara he almost cried
out aloud first in alarm and then in
delight and he at once invited him
to his villa there happened to be in
his garden there a spacious pavilion
apart from the house he proposed to
his friend that he should establish
himself in this pavilion muzzio
readily agreed and moved thither the
same day together with his servant
a dumb malay-dumb but not deaf
and indeed to judge by the alertness
of his expression a very intelligent
man his tongue had been cut out

  muzzio brought with him doz-
ens of boxes filled with treasures of
all sorts collected by him in the
course of his prolonged travels va-
leria was delighted at muzzios re-
turn and he greeted her with cheer-
ful friendliness but composure it
could be seen in his every action
that he had kept the promise given to
fabio during the day he completely
arranged everything in order in
his pavilion aided by his malay
he unpacked the curiosities he
had brought rugs silken stuffs ve

vet and brocaded garments weapons
goblets dishes and bowls decorated
with enamel things made of gold
and silver and inlaid with pearl and
turquoise carved boxes of jasper
and ivory cut bottles spices in-
cense skins of wild beasts and
feathers of unknown birds and a
number of other things the very use
of which seemed mysterious and in-
comprehensible among all these
precious things there was a rich
pearl necklace bestowed upon muz-
zio by the king of persia for some
great and secret service he asked
permission of valeria to put this
necklace with his own hand about
her neck she was struck by its
great weight and a sort of strange
heat in it  it seemed to burn to
her skin in the evening after din-
ner as they sat on the terrace of the
villa in the shade of the oleanders
and laurels muzzio began to relate
his adventures he told of the dis-
tant lands he had seen of cloud-
topped mountains and deserts rivers
like seas he told of immense build-
ings and temples of trees a thou-
sand years old of birds and flowers
of the colors of the rainbow he
named the cities and the peoples he
had visited    their very names
seemed like a fairy-tale the whole
east was familiar to muzzio he had
traversed persia arabia where the
horses are nobler and more beautiful
than any other living creatures he
had penetrated into the very heart
of india where the race of men grow
like stately trees he had reached the
boundaries of china and tibet
where the living god called the
grand lama dwells on earth in the
guise of a silent man with narrow
eyes

 marvelous were his tales and
both fabio and valeria listened to
him as if enchanted muzzios fea-
tures had really changed very little
his face swarthy from childhood
-id grown darker still burnt under
the song of triumphant love



the rays of a hotter sun his eyes
seemed more deep-set than before-
and that was all but the expression
of his face had beeome different
concentrated and dignified it never
showed more life when he recalled
the dangers he had encountered by
night in forests that resounded with
the roar of tigers or by day on soli-
tary ways where savage fanatics lay
in wait for travelers to slay them in
honor of their iron goddess who de-
mands human sacrifices and muz-
zios voice had grown deeper and
more even his hands his whole body
had lost the freedom of gesture pe-
culiar to the italian race with the
aid of his servant the obsequiously
alert malay he showed his hosts a
few of the feats he had learnt from
the indian brahmins thus for in-
stance having first hidden himself
behind a curtain he suddenly ap-
peared sitting in the air cross-legged
the tips of his fingers pressed lightly
on a bamboo cane placed vertically
which astounded fabio not a little
and positively alarmed valeria
isnt he a sorcerer was her
thought

  when he proceeded piping on a
little flute to call some tame snakes
out of a covered basket where their
dark flat heads with quivering
tongues appeared under a parti-
colored cloth valeria was terrified
and begged muzzio to put away these
loathsome horrors as soon as possible

 at supper muzzio regaled his
friends with wine of shiraz from
a round long-necked flagon it was
of extraordinary fragrance and
thickness of a golden color with a
shade of green in it and it shone
with a strange brightness as it was
poured into the tiny jasper goblets
in taste it wras unlike european
wines it was very sweet and spicy
and drunk slowly in small drafts
produced a sensation of pleasant
drowsiness in all the limbs muzzio
made both fabio and valeria drink

a goblet of it and he drank one him-
self bending over her goblet he
murmured something moving his fin-
gers as he did so valeria noticed
this but as in all muzzios doings
in his whole behavior there was
something strange and out of the
common she only thought can he
have adopted some new faith in in-
dia or is that the custom there

  after a short silence she asked him
if he had persevered with music
during his travels muzzio in re-
ply bade the malay bring his indian
violin it was like those of today
but instead of four strings it had
only three the upper part of it was
covered with a bluish snake-skin
and the slender bow of reed was in
the form of a half-moon and on its
extreme end glittered a pointed dia-
mond

  muzzio played first some mournful
airs national songs as he told them
strange and even barbarous to an
italian ear the sound of the metallic
strings was plaintive and feeble but
when muzzio began the last song it
suddenly gained force and rang out
tunefully and powerfully the pas-
sionate melody flowed out under the
wide sweeps of the bow flowed out
exquisitely twisting and coiling like
the snake that covered the violin-
top and such fire such triumphant
bliss glowed and burned in this mel-
ody that fabio and valeria felt
wrung to the heart and tears came
into their eyes while muzzio his
head bent and pressed close to
the violin his cheeks pale his eye-
brows drawn together into a single
straight line seemed still more con-
centrated and solemn and the dia-
mond at the end of the bow flashed
sparks of light as though it too
were kindled by the fire of the divine
song

  when muzzio had finished and
still keeping fast the violin between
his chin and his shoulder dropped
the hand that held the bow fabio


weird tales

cried what is that what is that
you have been playing to us va-
leria uttered not a word-but her
whole being seemed echoing her hus-
bands question

  muzzio laid the violin on the table
-and slightly tossing back his hair
he said with a polite smile that-
that melody    that song i heard
once in the island of ceylon that
song is known there among the
people as the song of happy trium-
phant love play it again fabio
was murmuring no it cant be
played again answered muzzio
besides it is now too late signora
valeria ought to be at rest and it
is time for me too i am weary

  during the whole day muzzio had
treated valeria with respectful sim-
plicity as a friend of former days
but as he went out he clasped her
hand very tightly squeezing his fin-
ders on her palm and looking so in-
tently into her face that though she
did not raise her eyelids she yet felt
the look on her suddenly flaming
cheeks she said nothing to muzzio
but jerked away her hand and when
lie was gone she gazed at the door
through which he had passed out
she remembered how she had been
r little afraid of him even in old
days and now she was overcome
by perplexity muzzio went otf to
his pavilion the husband and wife
went to their bedroom



t taijeria did not quickly fall

  v	asleep there was a faint and
languid fever in her blood and a
slight ringing in her ears-from
that strange wine as she supposed
and perhaps too from muzzios
stories from his playing on the vio-
lin toward morning she did at
ast fall asleep and she had an ex-
traordinary dream

  she dreamt that she was going in-
to a large room with a low ceiling
such a room she had never seen in

her life all the walls were covered
with tiny blue tiles with gold lines
on them slender carved pillars of
alabaster supported the marble ceil-
ing  the ceiling itself and the pillars
seemed half transparent and a pale
rosy light penetrated from all sides
into the room throwing a mysterious
and uniform light on all the objects
in it brocaded cushions lay on a
narrow rug in the very middle of the
floor which was smooth as a mirror
in the corners almost unseen avere
smoking lofty censers of the shape
of monstrous beasts there was no
window anywhere a door hung with
a velvet curtain stood dark and si-
lent in a recess in the wall and
suddenly this curtain slowly glided
moved aside and in came muzzio
he bowed opened his arms laughed
his fierce arms enfolded valerias
waist his parched lips burned her
all over    she fell backward on
the cushions

  moaning with horror after long
struggles valeria awoke still not
realizing where she was and what
avas happening to her she raised her-
self on her bed looked around a
tremor ran over her whole body   
fabio was lying beside her he was
asleep but his face in the light of
the brilliant full moon looking in at
the window was pale as a corpses
-it was sadder than a dead face
valeria waked her husband and di-
rectly he looked at her what is
the matter lie cried i had-i had
a fearful dream she whispered
still shuddering all over

  but at that instant from the direc-
tion of the pavilion came floating
powerful sounds and both fabio and
valeria recognized the melody muz-
zio had played to them calling it the
song of blissful triumphant love
fabio looked in perplexity at vale-
ria she closed her eyes turned
away and both holding their breath
heard the song out to the end as
the last note died away the moon
passed behind a cloud it was sud-
the song of triumphant love



denly dark in the room    both
the young people let their heads sink
on their pillows without exchanging
a word and neither of them noticed
when the other fell asleep



the next morning muzzio came in
to breakfast he seemed happy
and greeted valeria cheerfully she
answered him in confusion-stole a
glance at him-and felt frightened
at the sight of that serene happy
faee those piercing and inquisitive
eyes muzzio was beginning again
to tell some story but fabio inter-
rupted him at the first word

  you could not sleep i see in your
new quarters my wife and i heard
you playing last nights song

   yes did you hear it   said muz-
zio i played it indeed but i had
been asleep before that and i had a
wonderful dream too

  valeria was on the alert what
sort of dream asked fabio

 i dreamed answered muzzio
not taking his eyes off valeria i
was entering a spacious apartment
with a ceiling decorated in oriental
fashion carved columns supported
the roof the walls were covered with
tiles and though there were neither
windows nor lights the whole mom
was filled with a rosy light just as
though it were all built of transpar-
ent stone in the corners chinese
censers were smoking on the floor
lay brocaded cushions along a nar-
row rug i went in through a door
covered with a curtain and at an-
other door just opposite appeared a
woman whom i once loved and so
beautiful she seemed to me that i
was all aflame with my old love-

  muzzio broke off significantly
valeria sat motionless and only
gradually she turned white and she
drew her breath more slowly

 then continued muzzio i
waked up and played that song

  but who was that woman said
fabio	r	

  who was she the wife of an in-
dian-i met her in the town of delhi
she is not alive now-she died

  and her husband asked fabio
not knowing why he asked the ques-
tion

  her husband too they say is
dead i soon lost sight of them
both

    strange   observed fabio   my
wife too had an extraordinary
dream last night-muzzio gazed
intently at valeria-which she-did
not tell me added fabio

  but at this point valeria got up
and went out of the room imme-
diately after breakfast muzzio too
went away explaining that he had
to be in ferrara on business and
that he would not be back before the
evening



a few weeks before muzzios re-
turn fabio had begun a portrait
of his wife depicting her with the
attributes of saint cecilia he had
made considerable advance in his
art the renowned luini a pupil of
leonardo da vinci used to come to
him at ferrara and while aiding him
with his own counsels pass on also
the precepts of his great master the
portrait was almost completely fin-
ished  all that was left was to add a
few strokes to the faee and fabio
might well be proud of his creation

  he saw muzzio off on his way to
ferrara then turned into his studio
where valeria was usually waiting
for him but he did not find her
there he called her she did not re-
spond fabio was overcome by a se-
cret uneasiness he began looking for
her

 she was nowhere in the house
fabio ran into the garden and there
in one of the more secluded walks he
caught sight of valeria she was
sitting on a seat her head drooping
on to her bosom and her hands fold-
ed upon her knees while behind her


weird tales

peeping out of the dark green of a
cypress a marble satyr with a dis-
torted malignant grin on his face
was putting his pouting lips to a
pans pipe valeria was visibly re-
lieved at her husbands appearance
and to his agitated questions she re-
plied that she had a slight headache
but that it was of no consequence
and she was ready to come to sit to
him

  fabio led her to the studio posed
her and took up his brush but to
his great vexation he could not fin-
ish the face as he would have liked
to and not because it was some-
what pale and looked exhausted
 no but the pure saintly expres-
sion which he liked so much in it
and which had given him the idea of
painting valeria as saint cecilia he
could not find in it that day he
flung down the brush at last told his
wife he was not in the mood for
work and that he would not prevent
her from lying down as she did not
look at all well and put the canvas
with its face to the wall valeria
agreed with him that she ought to
rest and repeating her complaints of
a headache withdrew into her bed-
room

  fabio remained in the studio he
felt a strange confused sensation in-
comprehensible to himself muzzios
stay under his roof to which he
fabio had himself urgently invited
him was irksome to him and not
that he was jealous-could anyone
have been jealous of valeria-but
he did not recognize his former com-
rade in his friend all that was
strange unknown and new that muz-
zio had brought with him from those
distant lands-and which seemed to
have entered into his very flesh and
blood-all these magical feats songs
strange drinks this dumb malay
even the spicy fragrance diffused by
muzzios garments his hair his
breath-all this inspired in fabio a
sensation akin to distrust possibly

even to timidity and why did that
malay waiting at table stare with
such disagreeable intentness at him
fabio really anyone might sup-
pose that he understood italian
muzzio had said of him that in los-
ing his tongue this malay had made
a great sacrifice and in return he
was now possessed of great power
what sort of power and how could
he have obtained it at the price of
his tongue all this was very
strange very incomprehensible

  fabio went into his wifes room
she was lying on the bed dressed
but was not asleep hearing his
steps she started then again seemed
delighted to see him just as in the
garden fabio sat down beside the
bed took valeria by the hand and
after a short silence asked her what
was the extraordinary dream that
had frightened her so the previous
night and was it the same sort at
all as the dream muzzio had de-
scribed valeria crimsoned and
said hurriedly  oh no no i saw
-a sort of monster which was trying
to tear me to pieces

 a monster in the shape of a
man asked fabio no a beast-
a beast valeria turned away and
hid her burning face in the pillows

fabio held his wifes hand some
time longer silently he raised it to
his lips and withdrew

  both the young people passed that
day with heavy hearts something
dark seemed hanging over their
heads but what it was they could
not tell they avanted to be to-
gether as though some danger
threatened them but what to say to
one another they did not know
fabio made an effort to take up the
portrait and to read ariosto avhose
poem had appeared not long before
in ferrara and was now making a
noise all over italy but nothing was
of any use

  late in the evening just at sup-
per-time muzzio returned
the song of triumphant love





he seemed composed and cheerful
-but he told them little he de-
voted himself rather to questioning
fabio about their common acquaint-
ances about the german war and
the emperor charles he spoke of his
own desire to visit rome to see the
new pope he again offered valeria
some shiraz wine and on her re-
fusal observed as though to himself
now its not needed to be sure

  going back with his wife to their
room fabio soon fell asleep and
waking up an hour later felt a con-
viction that no one was sharing his
bed valeria was not beside him he
got up quickly and at the same in-
stant saw his wife in her night attire
coming out of the garden into the
room the moon was shining bright-
ly though not long before a light
rain had been falling with eyes
closed with an expression of myste-
rious horror on her immovable face
valeria approached the bed and
feeling for it with her hands
stretched out before her lay down
hurriedly and in silence fabio
turned to her with a question but
she made no reply she seemed to be
asleep he touched her and felt on
her dress and on her hair drops of
rain and on the soles of her bare
feet little grains of sand then he
leapt up and ran into the garden
through the half-open door the
crude brilliance of the moon wrapt
every object in light fabio looked
about him and perceived on the sand
of the pspth prints of two pairs of
feet-one pair were bare and these
prints led to a bower of jasmine on
one side between the pavilion and
the house he stood still in perplex-
ity and suddenly once more he
heard the strains of the song he had
listened to the night before

  fabio shuddered ran into the pa-
vilion muzzio was standing in the
middle of the room playing on the
violin fabio rushed up to him

  you have been in the garden
your clot lies arc wot with rain

  no  i dont know  i think
   i have not been out  muz-
zio answered slowly seeming amazed
at fabios entrance and his excite-
ment

  fabio seized him by the hand
and why are you playing that mel-
ody again have you had a dream
again   

  muzzio glanced at fabio with the
same look of amazement and said
nothing

  answer me

the moon stood high like a round shield 
like a snake the river shines   

the friends awake thefoes asleep   
the bird is in the falcons clutches   

     help

muttered muzzio humming to him-
self as though in delirium

  fabio stepped back two paces
stared at muzzio pondered a mo-
ment and went back to the house
to his bedroom

  valeria her head sunk on her
shoulder and her hands hanging life-
lessly was in a heavy sleep he
could not quickly awaken her-
but directly she saw him she filing
herself on his neck and embraced
him convulsively she was trembling
all over

  wliat is the matter my precious
what is it fabio kept repeating
trying to soothe her but she still
lay lifeless on his bicast

 ah what fearful dreams i
have she whispered hiding her
face against him fabio would have
questioned her but she only shud-
dered the window-panes were
flushed with the early light of morn-
ing when at last she fell asleep in
his arms



the next day muzzio disappeared
from early morning while vale-
ria informed her husband that she
intended to go away to a neighbor-


weird tales

ing monastery where lived her
spiritual father an old and austere
monk in whom she placed unbound-
ed confidence to fabios inquiries
she replied that she wanted by con-
fession to relieve her soul which was
weighed down by the exceptional im-
pressions of the last few days as
he looked upon valerias sunken
face and listened to her faint voice
fabio approved of her plan the
worthy father lorenzo might give
her valuble advice and might dis-
perse her doubts

  under the escort of four attend-
ants valeria set off to the monas-
tery while fabio remained at home
and wandered about the garden till
his wifes return tryingto compre-
hend what had happened to her and
a victim to constant fear and wrath
and the pain of undefined suspicions
more than once he went up to the
pavilion but muzzio had not re-
turned and the malay gazed at fabio
like a statue obsequiously bowing
his head with a well-dissembled-so
at least it seemed to fabio-smile on
his bronzed face

  meanwhile valeria had in confes-
sion told everything to her priest
not so much with shame as with hor-
ror the priest heard her atten-
tively gave her his blessing ab-
solved her from her involuntary sin
but to himself he thought sorcery
the arts of the devil-the matter
cant he left so and he returned
with valeria to her villa as though
with the aim of completely pacifying
and reassuring her

  at the sight of the priest fabio
was thrown into some agitation but
the experienced old man had thought
out beforehand how he must treat
him when he was left alone with
fabio he did not of course betray
the secrets of the confessional but
he advised him if possible to get rid
of the guest they had invited to their
house as by his stories his songs
and his whole behavior he was troub-
ling the imagination of valeria

moreover in the old mans opinion
muzzio had not he remembered been
very firm in the faith in former days
and having spent so long a time in
lands unenlightened by the truths of
christianity he might well have
brought thence the contagion of false
doctrine might even have become
conversant with secret magic arts
and therefore though long friend-
ship had indeed its claims still a
wise prudence pointed to the neces-
sity of separation

  fabio fully agreed with the excel-
lent monk valeria was even joyful
when her husband reported to her
the priests counsel and sent on his
way with the cordial good-will of
both the young people loaded with
good gifts for the monastery and the
poor father lorenzo returned home

  fabio intended to have an explan-
ation with muzzio immediately after
supper but his strange guest did not
return to supper then fabio de-
cided to defer his conversation with
muzzio until the following day and
both the young people retired to rest



ttaleria soon fell asleep but fabio

  v	could not sleep in the stillness
of the night everything he had seen
everything he had felt presented it-
self more vividly he put to himself
still more insistently questions to
which as before he could find no an-
swer had muzzio really become a
sorcerer and had he not already poi-
soned valeria she wag ill-but
what was her disease while he
lay his head in his hand holding his
feverish breath and given up to
painful reflection the moon rose
again upon a cloudless sky and to-
gether with its beams through the
half-transparent window-panes there
began from the direction of the pa-
vilion-or was it fabios fancy-to
come a breath like a light fragrant
current then an urgent passion-
ate murmur was heard and at
the song of triumphant love



that instant he observed that va-
leria was beginning faintly to stir
he started looked she rose up slid
first one foot then the other out of
the bed and like one bewitched of
the moon her sightless eyes fixed
lifelessly before her her hands
stretched out she began moving to-
ward the garden fabio instantly
ran out of the other door of the
room and running quickly round the
corner of the house bolted the door
that led into the garden he had
scarcely time to grasp at the bolt
when he felt someone trying to open
the door from the inside pressing
against it    again and again   
and then there was the sound of
piteous passionate moans   

  but muzzio has not come back
from the town   flashed through
fabios head and he rushed to the
pavilion

  coming toward him along the
path dazzlingly lighted up by the
moons rays was muzzio he too
moving like one moonstruck his
hands held out before him and his
eyes open but unseeing fabio
ran up to him but he not heeding
him moved on treading evenly step
by step and his rigid face smiled in
the moonlight like the malays fa-
bio would have called him by his
name but at that instant he heard
behind him in the house the creak-
ing of a window he looked round

  yes the window of the bedroom
was open from top to bottom and
putting one foot over the sill va-
leria stood in the window her
hands seemed to be seeking muzzio
-she seemed striving all over to-
ward him   

  unutterable fury filled fabios
breast with a sudden inrush ac-
cursed sorcerer he shrieked furi-
ously and seizing muzzio by the
throat with one hand with the other
he felt for the dagger in his girdle
and plunged the blade into his side
up to the hilt

  muzzio uttered a shrill scream

and clapping his hand to the wound
ran staggering back to the pavilion
but at the very same instant
when fabio stabbed him valeria
screamed just as shrilly and fell to
the earth like grass before the
scythe

  fabio flew to her raised her up
carried her to the bed began to
speak to her  

  she lay a long time motionless but
at last she opened her eyes heaved a
deep broken blissful sigh like one
just rescued from imminent death
saw her husband and twining her
arms about his neck erept close to
him

  you you it is you she faltered
gradually her hands loosened their
hold her head sank back and mur-
muring with a blissful smile thank
god it is all over    but how
weary i am she fell into a sound
but not heavy sleep



fabio sank down beside her bed
and never taking his eyes off her
pale and sunken but already calmer
face began reflecting on what had
happened and also on how he ought
to act now what steps was he to
take if he had killed muzzio-and
remembering how deeply the dagger
had gone in he could have no doubt
of it-it could not be hidden he
would have to bring it to the knowl-
edge of the archduke of the judges
-but how explain how describe
such an incomprehensible affair he
fabio had killed in his own house
his own kinsman his dearest friend
they will inquire what for on
what grounds but if muzzio were
not dead fabio could not endure
to remain longer in uncertainty and
satisfying himself that valeria was
asleep he cautiously got up from his
chair went oxit of the house and
made his way to the pavilion every-
thing was still in it only in one win-
dow a light was visible


weird tales

  with a sinking heart he opened
the outer door there was still the
print of blood-stained fingers on it
and there were black drops of gore
on the sand of the path passed
through the first dark room-and
stood still on the threshold over-
whelmed with amazement

  in the tniddle of the room on a
persian rug with a brocaded cush-
ion under his head and all his limbs
stretched out straight lay muzzio
covered with a wide red shawl with
a black pattern on it his face yel-
low as wax with closed eyes and
bluish eyelids was turned toward
the ceiling no breathing could be
discerned he seemed a corpse at
his feet knelt the malay also wrapt
in a red shawl he was holding in
his left hand a branch of some un-
known plant like a fern and bend-
ing slightly forward was gazing
fixedly at his master a small torch
fixed on the floor burnt with a green-
ish flame and was the only light in
the room the flame did not flicker
uor smoke

  the malay did not stir at fabios
ntry lie merely turned his eyes
upon him and again bent them upon
muzzio from time to time he raised
ind lowered the branch and waved
it in the air and his dumb lips slowly
parted and moved as though uttering
soundless words on the floor be-
iween the malay and muzzio lay the
dagger with which fabio had
tabbed his friend the malay struck
ne blow with the branch on the
blood-stained blade a minute
passed    another

  fabio approached the malay and
looping down to him asked in an
undertone is he dead the malay
bent his head from above down-
ward and disentangling his right
a and from his shawl he pointed im-
periously to the door fabio would
nave repeated his question but the
gesture of the commanding hand
was repeated and fabio went out

indignant and wondering but obedi-
ent

  he found valeria sleeping as be-
fore with an even more tranquil ex-
pression on her face he did not
undress but seated himself by the
window his head in his hand and
once more sank into thought the
rising sun found him still in the same
place valeria had not waked up



cabio intended to wait till she
awakened and then to set off to
ferrara when suddenly someone
tapped lightly at the bedroom door
fabio went out and saw his old
steward antonio signor began
the old man the malay has just in-
formed me that signor muzzio has
been taken ill and wishes to be
moved with all his belongings to the
town and that he begs you to let
him have servants to assist in pack-
ing his things and that at dinner-
time you would send pack-horses
and saddle-horses and a few attend-
ants for the journey do you allow
it the malay informed you of
this asked fabio in what man-
ner why he is dumb here
signor is the paper on which he
wrote all this in our language and
very correctly and muzzio you
say is ill yes he is very ill and
can see no one   have they sent for
a doctor no the malay forbade
it and was it the malay who
wrote you this yes it was he
fabio did not speak for a moment
well then arrange it all he said
at last antonio withdrew

  fabio looked after his servant in
bewilderment then lie is not
dead he thought and he did
not know whether to rejoice or to be
sorry  but a few hours ago
it was a corpse he had looked upon

  fabio returned to valeria she
waked up and raised her head the
husband and wife exchanged a long
look full of significance he is
the song of triumphant love



gone valeria said suddenly fabio
shuddered how gone is he
gone away she continued

  a load fell from fabios heart
not yet but he is going today
and i shall never never see him
again never and these
dreams will not come again no
valeria heaved a sigh of relief
a blissful smile once more appeared
on her lips she held out both hands
to her husband and we will never
speak of him never do you hear my
dear one and i will not leave my
room till he is gone and do you
now send me my maids but stay
take away that thing she pointed
to the pearl necklace lying on a lit-
tle bedside table the necklace given
her by muzzio   and throw it at once
into our deepest well embrace me
i am your valeria and do not come
in to me till-he has gone

  fabio took the necklace and did
as his wife had directed then he
fell to wandering about the garden
looking from a distance at the pavil-
ion about which the bustle of prepa-
rations for departure was beginning
servants were bringing out boxes
loading the horses-but the malay
was not among them an irresisti-
ble impulse drew fabio to look once
more upon what was taking place in
the pavilion he recollected that
there was at the back a secret door
by which he could reach the inner
room where muzzio had been lying
in the morning he stole round to
this door found it unlocked and
parting the folds of a heavy curtain
turned a faltering glance upon the
room within



jvfuzzio was not now lying on the
rug dressed as though for a
journey he sat in an armchair but
seemed a corpse just as on fabios
first visit his torpid head fell back
on the chair and his outstretched
hands hung lifeless yellow and rigid

on his knees his breast did not
heave near the chair on the floor
which was strewn with dried herbs
stood some flat bowls of dark liquid
which exhaled a powerful almost
suffocating odor the odor of musk
around each bowl was coiled a
small snake of brazen hue with
golden eyes that flashed from time
to time while directly facing muz-
zio two paces from him rose the
long figure of the malay wrapt in a
mantle of many-colored brocade
girt round the waist with a tigers
tail with a high hat of the shape of
a pointed tiara on his head but he
was not motionless at one moment
he bowed down reverently and
seemed to be praying at the next he
drew himself up to his full height
even rose on tiptoe then with a
rhythmic action threw wide his arms
and moved them persistently in the
direction of muzzio and seemed to
threaten or command him frowning
and stamping with his foot all these
actions seemed to cost him great ef-
fort even to cause him pain he
breathed heavily the sweat streamed
down his face all at once he sank
down to the ground and drawing in a
full breath with knitted brow and
immense effort drew his clenched
hands toward him as though he were
holding reins in them-and to the in-
describable horror of fabio muzzios
head slowly left the back of the chair
and moved forward following the
malays hands the malay let them
fall and muzzios head fell heavily
back again the malay repeated his
movements and obediently the head
repeated them after him the dark
liquid in the bowls began boiling
the bowls themselves began to re-
sound with a faint bell-like note
and the brazen snakes coiled freely
about each of them then the malay
took a step forward and raising his
eyebrows and opening his eyes im-
mensely wide he bowed his head to
muzzio    and the eyelids of the


weird tales

dead man quivered parted uncertain-
ly and under them could be seen the
eyeballs dull as lead the malays
face was radiant with triumphant
pride and delight a delight almost
malignant he opened his mouth wide
and from the depths of liis chest there
broke out with effort a prolonged
howl muzzios lips parted too and
a faint moan quivered  them in
response to that inhuman sound   

  but at this point fabio could en-
dure it  longer he imagined he was
present at some devilish incantation
he too uttered a shriek and rushed
out running home as quickly as pos-
sible without looking round repeat-
ing prayers and crossing himself as
he ran



three hours later antonio came
to him with the announcement
that everything was ready the things
were packed and signor muzzio was
preparing to start without a word
in answer to his servant fabio went
out on to the teriace whence the pa-
vilion could be seen a few pack-
horses were grouped before it a pow-
erful raven horse saddled for two
riders was led up to the steps where
servants were standing bareheaded
together with armed attendants the
door of the pavilion opened and sup-
ported by the malay who wore once
more his ordinary attire appeared
-luzzio his face was deathlike and
his hands hung like a dead mans
but he walked - yes positively
walked-and seated  the charger
he sat upright and felt for and found
the reins the malay put his feet in
the stirrups leaped up behind him on
the saddle put his arm round him
and the whole party started the
horses moved at a walking pace and
when they turned round before the
house fabio fancied that in muzzios
dark face there gleamed two spots of
white could it be he had turned
his eyes upon him only the malay

bowed to him-ironically as ever

  did valeria see all this her win-
dow-blinds were drawn-but it may
be she was standing behind them



 t dinner-time she came into the
dining room and was very quiet
and affectionate she still complained
however of weariness but there was
no agitation about her now none of
her former constant bewilderment
and secret dread and when the day
after muzzios departure fabio set to
work again on her portrait he found
in her features the pure expression
the momentary eclipse of which had
so troubled him and his brush
moved lightly over the canvas

  the husband and wife took up their
old life again muzzio vanished for
them as though he had never existed
fabio and valeria were agreed as it
seemed not to utter a syllable refer-
ring to him not to leam anything of
his later days his fate remained how-
ever a mystery for all muzzio did
actually disappear as though he had
sunk into the earth fabio one day
thought it his duty to tell valeria ex-
actly what had taken place on that
fatal night but she probably di-
vined his intention and she held her
breath half-shutting her eyes as
though she were expecting a blow
fabio understood her and he did
not inflict that blow upon her

  one fine autumn day fabio was
putting the last touches to his picture
of his cecilia valeria sat at the or-
gan her fingers straying at random
over the keys suddenly with-
out her knowing it from under her
hands came the first notes of that
song of triumphant love which muz-
zio had once played and at the same
instant for the first time since her
marriage she felt within her the
throb of a new palpitating life   
valeria started stopped   

  what did it mean  could it be-

 flood of letters from you the readers as well as the rapid growth of the
 magazine strengthens this belief but we realize there are numberlessways
 in which the magazine can be made still better and we welcome suggestions
 from you for this is your magazine

     the discussion keeps up as to whether we should continue to print one
 weird tale of the past each month in our weird story reprint section and
 this month for the first time those who are opposed to the reprints have made
 a good showing though they are still greatly in the minority

     yourreprints are old and stale dry and very uninteresting writes
 ralph c hartman of portsmouth virginia and you are ruining your
 magazine with serials cut out the reprints and serials

     writes f  rogers of washington d c allow me to congratulate
 you upon your choice of reprint in the story lazarus it is the best story pub-
 lished in weird tales for the past two years

     george montague of trenton new jersey writes to the eyrie your
 reprints i do not care so much about but your other stories are way above
 par i have just finished reading the first installment of explorers into infin-
 ity it is a wonderfully gripping tale well told for years your magazine
 has been my chief reading matter of course my brother claims he discov-
 ered it but i know i did

      as to the reprints j k sears of galveston texas writes   truly there
 is no accounting for individual letters all this talk about cutting out poes
 stories and the reprint department for the sake of a long-suffering pub-
 lic is unworthy of intelligent human beings weird tales is a won-
 derful fount of pleasure to all of us who enjoy weird fiction dont spoil the
 reputation you have gained keep it weird by all means

weird tales

years i have read your delightful magazine and i can truthfully say that i
have never read its equal i was disappointed though when i read in the
eyrie in the april number that you are going to continue the monthly re-
print story i have just laid the magazine up in despair for having read all
the rest of your horrible shivery and delightful stories i attacked the re-
print honestly i couldnt finish it i dont believe there has ever been one
reprint which i started that i could finish you have a magazine that would
be ideal but for one thing and that thing is the reprints

    a few months ago writes miss amy beck of chisholm minnesota
i picked up a copy of weird tales and when i laid it down i had read
every story every poem and every word in the eyrie so far ive not missed
a copy when the magazine comes i look for the reprint first i think that a
very good department in your magazine

    philip ii buscher of washington d c writes to the eyrie i have
never written to this department before but saw the suggestion made in the
eyrie by a gentleman in st louis and i agree with him that you should stop
the reprint stories use the space for your readers own weird experiences in
reality and dreams 

    by all means continue the reprint stories writes lion penhall rees
of toronto canada they serve as a foil fflr our newer and very often
better authors of the present day  

    your last three issues have been very fine writes robert e howard
from cross plains texas certainly no magazine has ever offered a tale as
unique and thought-inspiring as the serial by mr cummings

    writes john b woodhouse from on board the hamburg-american steam-
er deutschland i am on shipboard and have just finished my tenth weird
tales the magazine has helped me to pass away many happy hours that
otherwise would have- been boresome why not publish a list of all the
stories in w t for the last twelve issues and have the readers vote on the
best five someone asked in the eyrie a few months ago that you select the
best stories from w t and publish them in book form well why not
such stories as the woman of the wood the night wire the atomic con-
querors the white ship and the last horror are worthy of book form and
a wide circulation

    please print some more insect stories like the city of spiders writes
roland fernekes of oakmont pennsylvania i am a new reader of your
magazine but i never regret the day i bought the first one i like especially
the scientific stories such as the star shell and drome

    please give us more space-stories writes james t ballew of newport
news virginia and adds they always make a hit i have been a silent
admirer of w t for a long time and feel that i should let you hear from
me relative to the stories i like best i read each and every one every month
but some i like better than others which is very natural i think the star
shell was excellent and i hope that explorers into infinity turns out to be
as good it is very promising drome is also a wonderful piece of fiction and
i hope we have more such stories  

   writes mrs marion m le paire of detroit michigan although
usually i am not addicted to this type of fiction a copy of weird tales-one
of the first-was brought to me by my husband i was immediately attracted
by the diversity originality and correctness of detail i found therein since
then each month finds me eagerly awaiting the appearance of weird tales
you have in it something unique and while i could readily absorb a semi-
the eyrie



monthly additional issue i believe the flavor and spice might be dimmed by
too frequent publication

    donald g ward of auburn new york writes to the eyrie i ran
across your magazine four months ago and bought the issue containing the
first installment of drome this story is magnificent something different
from most stories i buy weird tales for the weird-scientific stories they
far outclass all others save seabury quinns your best authors are edmond
hamilton eli colter and quinn cummings is splendid too judging him
by the first installment of the new serial explorers into infinity

    the april number is splendid -writes mrs roy blaire of samoa
california may we have more tales relating to the supernatural such as
the return and out of the earth in this issue the latter i think is quite
the best story in this number id like more stories of werewolves and ele-
mentals especially the latter the interplanetary stories are interesting but
getting a bit stale as everyone seems to be having a try at them i like the
stories of evolution too

    poe would be in his element reading weird tales i am sure writes
helen marchand of west haven connecticut i like the weird-scientific
tales best and i like particularly the stories having to do with that queer
funny little french doctor jules de grandin

    drome is one of the most interesting stories i have ever read writes
eugene cameron of tulsa oklahoma it is of scientific value and told in
a way that isnt boring explorers into infinity i am sure is going to prove
every bit as interesting as drome  

    boy do i like quinns stories writes william e venable of annis-
ton alabama im just crazy about the french scientist jules de grandin
and his little expression i say to me

    readers your favorite story in the april weird tales as shown by your
votes is the first installment of explorers into infinity by ray cummings

laughed shortly i want to save all
my strength however to appear to
margie my false lovely margie he
added insinuatingly

  this is really too much ex-
claimed ned trying in vain to ex-
tricate his hand from the iron hold
of the psychic i intend to see if
that fellow is solid enough to feel
the weight of my fist let me go
please 

  the scotchwomans strong hand
maintained its immovable grip and
she turned to shake her head warn-
ingly at him then she spoke again
to the intruder

  you have been taking the psy-
chic energy from this poor little lame
girl so that you could appear ma-
terially for shame clifford bentley
no matter what your motive do you
consider that a manly thing to do
what has clare ever done to you
that you should subject her to such
treatment look at the poor child
now helpless her disturbed spirit
torn with agony as she sees you
clothed in the psychic vitality you
have stolen from her in order to de-
stroy her sisters happiness does
not that stir your heart with remorse
and pity

  it is entirely up to margaret re-
plied the materialized clifford i
loved margie she promised to be
my wife she let me put my ring
on her finger she is morally bound
to me now she is betraying me for
that other - that weak fellow whose
silly brain i can sway as i choose
scornfully

weird tales

you so much as injure a hair of his
head the harm done him will re-
bound-it will result in serious suffer-
ing to this little lame girl entranced
in our circle

  it seems i find friends wherever
i go   observed clifford bentley with
a mocking intonation that infuriated
wentworth even margie he
went on with pointed and deliberate
malice lay in my arms last night
and returned mv warm kisses with
her own she can not deny it can
you margie

  ned his tanned skin pallid with
unutterable horror and loathing
turned wide eyes upon the face of the
girl whose hand he held her lids
dropped before his accusing gaze

  margie he groaned it isnt
true dear

  it might be well mr wentworth
to refrain from questions and accusa-
tions for the time being observed
mrs campbell dryly you should
be ashamed to think evil of the
woman you love mr clifford bentley
you have been telling a lie that is
half truth and that is the basest of
lies i must ask you now to tell the
exact truth or i shall waken clare-
you know i can do it - and after
you have returned to your etheric
form i shall take certain steps that
will result in your being bound down
for many years as you may not care
to be bound oh you may smile-
i assure you i can do this much as i
dislike it and much as it may cost
me are you going to speak
somewhat sulkily the unwelcome
clifford turned from her oh i
suppose i must not refuse a ladys
request especially since it is put so
persuasively and he smiled sourly
very well then - i lied about
margie  kissed her to be sure
she kissed me too - but she didnt
know it was i but what does it
matter my dear lady he went on
to mrs campbell sarcastically if
margie wont remain true to her

happiness as i never felt before you
wont call me back to limp on my
crutches again will you dear ones

  clifford bentley began wringing his
hands with a kind of tense anguish
that was terrible to behold now his
voice rang out clearly

  oh i have done wrong i see it

fault that you will not return i

 sweet were the tones of clares far-
 away voice you were lonely now
 i understand and i can not blame
 you poor lonely clifford after all
 you must not reproach yourself - i
 shall be happier here - i can be
 with my dear ones as i choose - and
 i shall suffer no more with a weak
 heart and useless feet

   the figure of the entranced girl
 sank lower in the chair the psy-
 chic cried out suddenly as she felt
 that cold hand pulling on her own
 warm one

   turn on the lights she com-
 manded her voice agitated and
 alarmed oh why did i consent to
 this i know what douglas will say
 to me now

  margaret almost holding her
breath heard a soft whisper in her
ear good-bye my margie i shall
always be near you god bless you

   ned still holding his sweethearts
 hand tightly in his own felt a soft
 cheek brush his and he trembled on
 the verge of tears something told
 him it was clares farewell to him

 stood looking sadly down upon the

 throat as he spoke his eyes meeting
