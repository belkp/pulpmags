the gambler

he gambles that a lucky break will
come to him in the course of time

most men live in the hope that their lucky break will
come tomorrow or next week or next year

they gamble that pate some day some way will make
them rich i they risk their whole lives on what may come to
them in the course of time

this is a worse form of gambling than gambling for
monet with a card sharp or a three shell game expert

gambling on what time and fate have in store for you
is more costly than any other form of gambling known

you lose more than money you lose your self-
respect you lose the self-respect of those about you

and as each year passes your chance to amount to any-
thing becomes slimmer and slimmer

you get discouraged you begin to feel that fate is against
you you complain secretly about your ill luck perhaps you hide
your shortcomings behind a whole flock of easy excuses

but the hard cold world doesnt care about you

youve got to look out for yourself

time alone canpot help you if it could every man over
 would be rich

you cannot count on luck or fate or circumstances if you
could everybody would get rich at some time or other

your life is too precious to waste away waiting for some-
thing to turn up

theres one sure way-yes only one sure way-to
get what you want out of life

nothing can help you but your own brain make your brain
just a little bit more effective and you will multiply your
earning power

there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish
scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten per
cent of our brain power ninety per cent is unused it lies
dormant the longer it is unused the harder it becomes for us
to use it for the mind is like a muscle it grows in power
through exercise and use u weakens and deteriorates with
idleness

what can you do about it that is the question you are
asking yourself here is a suggestion

spend c for a postage stamp send in the coupon below for
a copy of scientific mind training there is no further obliga-
tion whatever you need not spend another penny

read this little book it has opened the eyes of hundreds of
thousands of other individuals who had the same problems you
naveover ceople in all parts of the world and in all
walks of life have followed the advice given in this booklet lords
and servants princes and laborers captains of industry and clerks
bookkeepers and bankers men and women of all types and
of all ages have read this book and have changed their whole
scheme of existence as a result 

this little book will tell you the secret of self-confidence of
ft strong will of a powerful memory of unflagging concentration
it tells you how to acquire directive powers how to train your
imagination the greatest force in the world how to make quick
accurate decisions how to reason logically-in short how to make
your brain an instrument of all-around power it tells you how
to banish the negative qualities like forgetfulness brain fag

inertia indecision self-consciousness lack of ideas mind wander-
ing lack of system procrastination timidity

men like judge ben b lindsey sir harry lauder prince

p walsh chairman of the national war labor board and hun-
dreds of others equally famous praise the simple method of
increasing brainpower and thought power described in this free
book  over  others praise it

independence

thousands who read this announcement will do nothing
about it the eftort and the will needed to send for this book-
which is free-may be lacking how can these people ever

a classic in science-fiction

mr hugo gernsback editor of wonder stories herewith presents in book

form his famous story-ralph c -j--a romance of the year  this story

originally ran in modern electrics one of mr gernsbacks magazines there are
only a limited number of copies of this book available at present this book is the fore-
runner of all modern science
fiction stories and contains
more novel ideas more future
inventions some of which
have already come true than
any book of its kind that has
ever been published it is
science fiction plus a pion-
eer in the electrical and
radio field hugo gerns-
back fias a profound
knowledge of the subjects
coupled with a finely
trained and highly imag-
inative mind this un-
usual combination has
enabled him to fore-
shadow with almost
unbelievable accuracy
some of the more  re-
cent developments
his earlier predic-
tions which have
appeared from time
to time during the
past decade in
many newspapers

and magazines are
now realities every
prophecy ia based
on accurate scienti-
fic knowledge hia
ideas are no more
fantastic than the
realities and com-
monplaces erf our

grandfathers

    prophetic fiction is the mother of scientific fact

c p mason associate editor

the wonders of creation

by hugo gernsback

ery recently prof einstein
had a change of mind and
announced that he no longer
believed in his original con-
cept of a closed universe

originally einstein pictured

the limits of space as similar to that of
a bubble the material world being en-
closed completely inside but the surface
having no end any more than a sphere
can have an end einstein was not con-
cerned with what lay outside of the
sphere in order to understand this
concept one must be a mathematician
because it does not fit in with the reason-
ing processes of the non-mathematical
mentality

for one i have always been reluctant
to accept this part of einsteins concept
of the universe and the idea of a limited
space is as repugnant as the idea of a
finite infinity or the finiteness of time

of course everything along this line of
thought must for a long time be purely
speculative and perhaps will always re-
main so there is indeed much doubt
that the ultimate nature of space will
ever be fully understood by the human
mind for it is not constituted to deal
with such immensities

the mathematical mind will tell you
that space cannot exist without matter
supposing we consider a star on the very
limits of this cosmic universe the
present concept is at least from a mathe-
matical viewpoint that anything that lies
beyond the star  is not space because
there is no matter there of course to
the non-mathematical mind this seems
an absurdity because the mind will in-
sist that there must be space beyond the
star even if there is no matter the
point can be argued pro and con and
we will probably not get much farther
in the end then too such questions as
when space originated how long it has
lasted and if there is to be an end to
space may all seem fruitless speculations
but they are questions asked by the
average curious mind

lately tolman has come forward with

the idea of an expanding universe which
again conflicts with older concepts be-
cause an expanding universe also brings
with it the thought of an expanding space

all of these theories do not in the least
conflict with the general einsteinian
theory of relativity as they really have
nothing to do with it and they do not
disturb the space-time concept of einstein
in the least

in the meanwhile the only answer to
the riddle that might be given in the
future will be direct astronomical obser-
vation and it is here that we can look
for perhaps a partial answer to the
riddle every time a new and larger tele-
scope is trained on the skies we learn
more about the secrets of space and the
farther we penetrate into its immensity
the more we will be able to deduce

for instance it is not at all certain
that conditions within our own galaxy
are the same as those of other universes
located millions or billions of light years
away from us the interplay of forces
such as gravitation for instance might
be entirely different in one universe than
they are in another the universal laws
might be the same yet the effects might
be entirely different for reasons that we
can but dimly vision today

we know practically nothing of the in-
ter-relation of different universes if
for example we have two island universes
some millions of light years apart from
each other with no other matter nearby
what will be the status of these cosmic
entities will they be motionless or
will they be attracted to each other and
will they gravitate about each other as
for instance the moon does around the
earth or as the planets gravitate around
the sun it is of course the tremend-
ous distances that are concerned here
which may make the conditions totally
different than if comparatively minute
distances such as planetary or ordinary
interstellar distances were involved on
these tantalizing problems future astron-
omical researches will no doubt throw
a great deal of light

a vast transparent sphere had floated into their space inside the
shell bathed in blue light was observed the queer human creature
the emperor of the stars



cttje a quarter of a million miles off
it our course

joe burns looked up from the oxygena-
tion apparatus whose valves he had been
adjusting thats lovely whats happen-
ed

dont know replied a fries naviga-
tor of the first terrestrial expedition to the
planet pluto outpost of the solar system
weve swung that
much off in the last
four hours and i
cant find a damn
thing wrong speed
relative to the sun
hasnt varied from a
steady thousand miles
per second correc-
tive side rockets have
exploded regularly and
the meters show full
power

ive checked and re-
checked my calcula-
tions till im dizzy all
correct didnt want
to tell you till i was
sure i couldnt find the
error no use bother-
ing you youve enough
to do keeping us alive
in here insides your
job outsides mine

but im stuck now

they had passed
neptune in their flight
and were out in the un-
traveled reaches of
space midway iu their
journeying to the new
planet

two hundred and fifty thousand miles
off you say which way burns steady
tones revealed no perturbation over the
alarming news

minus on the plane alpha  deg 
 on gamma  deg  

space navigation is plotted y reference to three

lanes having earth a their common intersection
ne of these planes alpha is determined by the
plane of the ecliptic and uses therefore the celestial
pbere the others beta and gamma are at right
ingles to this plane and to each other

perhaps weve gotten into the attraction
sphere of some unknown planet burns sug-
gested

impossible any body which could ex-
ert enough attraction to swing us so rapidly
off our course against the inertia our great
speed gives us would be clearly apparent to
the naked eye or at least in our telescope
there isnt any ive looked my eyes out

besides ive searched
every direction with
the gravito-statoscope
and found no evidence
of any attractive force
not accounted for by
known bodies you
know that instrument
will respond to the at-
traction of a grain of
dust at a distance of
five hundred miles
no joe there just
isnt any explanation
have you tried the
emergency corrective
rockets

sure have used
as many as i dared
the explosions didnt
have the slightest ef-
fect 

hell al you must
be off your nut what
you tell me just cant
be so wish i knew
enough math to check
your figures not
that i havent all the
confidence in the world
-i mean universe-in
you but maybe this
long lonesome journey is getting you

fries paled io you really think thats
it joe

the chemist laughed oh forget it old
boy of course i didnt mean it but you
stop thinking along that line or it will be
so here let me get at that telescope-ill
find the mischief-maker

joe stepped smilingly to the eye-piece of

 an instrument for detecting new gravitational in-
fluences acting on the ship

 rthere are mor cs
things  said hamlet 
than are dreamt of in your
philosophy  this story by
our popular team of auth-
ors serves but to prove this
oft-quoted phrase

sir james jeans has only
recently assured us that
the world we inhabit is but
a product of our senses
and may be simply a three-
dimensional projection
from a super world sim-
ilarly it is possible for oth-
er worlds to exist all about
us whose laws may be en-
tirely different than ours

all our physical laws
such as gravitation etc are
possibly peculiar to our
universe and in another
universe particles of matter
may repel each other in-
stead of attracting

surely the possibilities of
a corking story in a theme
like this are endless our
authors have taken advan-
tage of them to create a
stirring tale of the adven-
i tures of two earth-men in
an alien universe	p

the powerful electro-optical refractor he
turned one or two gleaming thumb-screws
then squinted into the tube the smile slow-
ly died from his face instead a look of
amazement took its place that turned to
terror his face was white al come
here he whispered

what is it what do you see

nothing

then why are you looking like that
i said nothing not nothing new i see
absolutely nothing

what fries almost shouted here

in his turn the navigator gazed long and
searchingly through the eyepiece his
bronzed face
too betrayed
the blood
w i t hdrawn
called back to
an affrighted
heart

in all that
vast sky
space had
been swept
clean noth-
ing but black-
ness the num-
berless points

o	f dazzling
lights that
were great
worlds and

huge suns had gone as it some cosmic nana
had erased them from the skies their
staunch ship floated in total emptiness

al look here look burns impertur-
able no longer was pointing with trembling
finger to the bank of white dials

fries looked the pointer of every in-
strument showing their relation to some out-
side body was at zero the velocimeter
the deviatoscope even the gravito-statoscope
none was functioning

the two adventurers gazed at each other
in blank wonderment what could this
mean it could not be true that they had
passed beyond all other matter that they
were alone in space that within the shell of

arthur l zagat

this little space-flier was the entire material
universe incredible

and yet-what other explanation could
there be

while still their reeling brains strove with
the problem there was a lurch-one only-
a flash of blinding light at the quartz port-
hole-then all was as before but no-
joes fingers dug into als arm as with his
free hand he again pointed to the banked
dials

they were functioning once again but
how it seemed as though all these staid
mathematical instruments had gone suddenly
crazy

the pointer of the velocimeter was swing-

i	n g wildly
against the
brass pin at
the zero line
in an endeavor
to push past
it as though
it were trying
t o register
negative velo-
city  the de-

wobbling i n
all directions
at once the
gravito - stato-
scope was reg-
istering nega-
tive quanti-
ties i ndicat-

my god have the instruments been put
out of commission or have we gotten into a
topsy turvy world cried al rushing to the
telescope while joe jumped for the port-
hole simultaneous exclamations burst
from both

no longer was there the black of unlit
space but neither were there the shining
points of light the old familiar constella-
tions spangling the velvet back drop of
space instead they were swimming in an
intense blue light deeper by far than the
fairest earth sky against the blue were
silhouetted black disks and lesser points-
myriads of them

the emperor of the stars



the earth-men stared at each other blank-
ly joe spoke first where are we
what has happened to us

a was frankly stumped i dont know
this is not our world our universe i may
be crazy but maybe weve been pushed into
a different universe that might account
for the strange gyrations of our instru-
ments he warmed to the idea after
all theres something in that according to
einstein our space our universe is curved
around into an enormous sphere true he
assumes that there is absolutely nothing in-
side or outside that sphere not even empti-
ness

but suppose he were wrong suppose
that there are other universes all spheres of
space floating in a great super-space sup-
pose that one of these sphere universes in
some manner impinged on our space tan-
gential ly through a freak of fortune we
happened to hit that one spot since the
two spaces touch we went hurtling from our
own familiar universe into this strange one
the existence of which has never even been
dreamt of by our scientists

impossible gasped joe i cant be
lieve it he shook his head as though his
disbelief gave him no comfort

once more they gazed out at the unknown
in the blue radiance the black disks had
grown perceptibly smaller

hello cried al were being pushed
away from those dark worlds if worlds they
really are

thats fine maybe well be thrown clear
back into our world again joes face
showed that slowly he was yielding to the
belief that this impossible thing must have
happened	x

what al yelled in his indignation
do you mean to stand there and tell me
that you are willing to leave all this-the
greatest the most sensational adventure that
happened to mortal men without even a
look around

all right keep your shirt on retorted
the castigated one if you want to inves-
tigate this nightmare im with you only
please remember that as it is we have only
an infinitely small chance of locating that

one small point of contact again and if
we move about here well lose that one
chance

but the fire of the pioneering scientist
blazed too brightly in al i dont care
what happens we stay think of it man
a new a different universe

youre the doctor i hope though we
find a world we can live on and some
interesting people for make up your mind
well never see old terra firma again

al ignored him hm there doesnt
seem to be any gravity here were being
repelled instead of attracted tell you
what you do joe use some of our rear
rockets thatll force us ahead

accordingly two rockets were fired in-
tently al watched the instrument board
sure enough the velocimeter registered a
forward velocity the deviatoscope acted
normally again only the gravito-statoscope
continued to evidence repelling influences

a topsy-turvy world

as they drove ahead both men watched
the new heavens anxiously one of the
black disks was gradually disengaging it-
self from its fellows and growing slowly
perceptibly larger about the size of the
moon now

al looked once more at his instruments
their velocity was decreasing shoot off
another rocket joe he ordered once
more they forged ahead

queer sort of matter in this world he
continued ruminatively repels us in-
stead of attracting everything seems just
the reverse of what we know the space
glows and the stars are dark and i see
no evidence of suns or anything to account
for the queer blue light

meanwhile the dark world they were aim-
ing for was growing steadily larger then
a queer thing happened the nearer they
approached the higher it rose abgve them
until it was directly overhead a vast ball
filling half the firmament

joe was surprised and told his friend so
not at all al responded up and
down are purely relative terms that have no
meaning in space it is only when you come


wonder stories

within range of matter that these words
have any significance

in our universe a material body res-
ponding to gravitational influences attracts
your body to it in other words you fall
toward it-which means that the attracting
body is beneath

here in this universe on the contrary
matter possesses only the property of re-
pulsion you are driven away from the
world in other words you are falling from
it-which means that this world is overhead
as far as we are concerned to reach it we
shall have to climb straight up

then how in blazes are we going to land
or it to see what its all about well be like
flies on a ceiling

youre right al confessed i didnt
think of that however well get as close
as we can and see what we can discover
with the aid of rockets they drove on
and up until they touched the huge ceiling

the two gazed out upon an illimitable
expanse of black lava-like rock craggy and
bare no life no movement was visible in
the spectral blue glare that beat upon the
immense rocky plain indeed no life as
we know it could be possible for aside from
the difficulty of clinging to a ceiling of
rock joes tests quickly showed the absence
of any atmosphere

i cant see the sense of wasting any more
time hanging here he said finally lets
try and find a more inviting world

hold on a moment whats that al
was pointing excitedly through the port-
hole

not half a mile off a broad orange beam
of light had suddenly shot out from the
black surface even as they gazed a long
cylindrical object appeared at the base of
the beam steadied itself a moment then shot
out downward into space its flight was so
swift that it vanished instantaneously the
orange light contracted until it too disap-
peared

thats either an upside down volcanic
eruption or else- joe paused uncertainly

or else-thats just what were going to
investigate al sprang to the controls
rapidly he propelled the space-ship to the
point where the orange ray had appeared

and hovered directly underneath it

they gazed up at a huge inverted funnel
tapering on top to a flat narrow area

turn on the searchlight joe lets see
whats up there

obediently joe swung the parabolic re-
flector into focus and turned on the current
an invisible ray stabbed through the blue
space impinged inside the funnel and lit it
up with a blinding light

al whistled look how smooth the walls
are how regular the curve thats an arti-
ficial orifice joe and something just came
out of it im going in there to investi-
gate

hold on theredont let your enthus-
iasm run away with you joe cautioned
in the first place ive seen volcanic cones
as smooth and regular as this one and if
it is-you remember that orange flare-
another eruption while youre squinting at
it will mean the end of this little expedition
besides this boats too big to fit in there
and if we get out whatll hold us and the
ship from all flopping down--god knows
where-in this crazy space

im not worrying much about the vol-
cano idea retorted al as for our fall-
ing just run us as far up into the opening
as you can and ill attend to the rest care-
ful that the air lock is on top though

joe shook his head doubtfully grumbled
a bit but followed instructions once
snugly in position the beams of the search-
light illuminated the interior there was
no question about it now-the funnel was
patently artificial the walls were of
black polished stone at the tip overhead
was a flat slab of the same material a
circular incision about four feet in diameter
was evident in the slab

chapter ii
the green terrors

al was hastily donning his space suit
electrically heated and containing oxy-
gen-respiratory apparatus

for gods sake al what do you intend
doing joe cried out in alarm

do tie this ship to the sides of the
the emperor of the stars



funnel so she stays put remember we
have four steel rings welded on the outside
of our ship

by this time he had donned the suit only
the helmet was not yet clamped into position
he took out of the tool chest two huge
steel spikes two lengths of massive chain
ending in huge hooks an electric drill
and picked up a disruptor tube

now im ready you hold the boat steady
while i work when the ships securely
fastened ill wave in at the porthole then
you get into your space suit and climb out
bring a crowbar along and your disruptor
tube

he climbed up into the air lock shut the
panel behind him slid open the outer panel
and climbed on top of the space flier

he chose a spot in the polished rock close
to one of the ships steel rings with the
electric drill it was a matter of minutes to
fashion a deep hole al then inserted a
spike at an angle slipped a length of chain
over it the chain was secure next he
slipped the great hook at the other end into
the steel ring repeating the operation on
the other side the space-ship was hanging
securely fastened

then he waved in signal shortly joe
was clambering out also enclosed in a space-
suit he carried a long crowbar with him
fortunately the top slab was only a few
feet above their heads with right good
will they shoved against the inside stone
it moved slightly greater grew their exer-
tions finally it lifted as though on a
hinge eagerly they pushed harder until it
fell over inside revealing a circular hole
through which an orange light streamed

al spoke through the wireless phone in-
cluded in the helmet equipment just give
me a leg up joe like a good fellow

joe bent clasped his hands in front al
put one foot onto the clasped hands and
joe heaved until he was able to clamber
through the opening immediately he ex-
tended an arm down and with great exer-
tion pulled joe up alongside of him

they found themselves at the bottom of
a slanting well far in the distance was a
circular opening through which an orange
light filtered

slowly laboriously they negotiated the
steep climb at last they emerged panting
into the orange glare

what they saw was so inconceivably
strange so opposed to all their preconceived
notions that they stood still gasping with
astonishment

they were standing on a vast plain com-
posed of the same rocky material as the
outside bleak barren thrown into giant
crags and mountains there was no hori-
zon the plain curved upwards until it was
lost in the distant haze the whole atmos-
phere was bathed in an orange glow eman-
ating from a huge globe of fire overhead
the sun of this interior world

no sign of life revealed itself in the hid-
eous barrenness of the huge concavity

good lord what is this anyway joe
spoke through his phone we have to
climb up to land on this place then bust
our way through and then we find our-
selves standing inside a hollow shell with
a sun and everything its certainly confus-
ing and why if this matter has no gravi-
tation as you say but exercises a repulsive
force why isnt it down on this side too so
that we would fall kerplunk into this space
also

because al spoke up that sun over-
head must be the source of the repulsion
i get it all now the waves of repulsion
emanating from the sun keeps this shell pro-
perly spaced around it and causes every-
thing to be pushed against it including us
that would give exactly the same effect as
far as we are concerned as though we were
held here by force of normal gravity furth-
ermore the repelling waves must penetrate
this shell of material and flow out into the
blue space of this universe that was why
our ship was being forced away

how about removing our space suits
i always feel uncomfortable in them al
continued

just a moment while i test this atmos-
phere to see if its livable

joe extracted from a pocket of his suit a
clever little device the turn of a valve
the pressure of a button and an electric coil
heated a sample of the atmosphere a glance


wonder stories

through the tiny spectroscope attachment
and its constitution was revealed

oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide-the
same gases that make up our air v and just
about in the same proportions alright
al we can breathe this atmosphere off
go the suits

swiftly the two tore off their helmets
opened the zippers of the overalls
quickly the protective garments were folded
into compact bundles stowed in the shoulder
knapsacks prepared for their reception
the two drew in long breaths of air it
seemed good to breathe freely again reck-
less of consequences free from the everlast-
ing necessity of watching dials and switches
and levers

thats good glad to get rid of that
synthetic mixture weve been living on ever
since we left mother earth wonder if
theres any life here

lets scout around a bit though from
the looks of things it doesnt seem likely
yet how about that hinged slab and the
cylinder we saw shoot out of it

meanwhile they explored the chaotic ter-
rain suddenly joe halted whats that
behind that rock

around a boulder not far ahead appear-
ed a jelly-like creeper as the startled
earth-men watched the creeper swelled ex-
panded and lo there before them was a
nightmare creature up it towered a quiv-
ering green jelly formless yet multiform-
its malevolent aspect sent a thrill of horror
through the adventurers

theres your specimen of life al hope
you like it

cautiously they approached the creature
disruptor tubes handy motionless it ap-
peared to be unaware of their presence
they were about ten feet away when sud-
denly a tentacle spurted out from the form-
less mass straight for joe so lightning
swift was the attack that he barely had time
to spring beyond its reach

a cry from al another and yet another
of the horrible jelly masses had appeared
from behind the strewn rocks they were
rolling rapidly nearer

i dont like this so much-lets get back

to the ship while we can joe exclaimed

im afraid its too late-well have to
fight our way al replied grimly look
over there

the entire plain was alive with the heav-
ing forms of the protoplasmic denizens of
this queer world especially were they
numerous around the tunnel exit the
earth-men were ringed about now with the
quivering menaces-their ever-forming ten-
tacles flicking out toward them with incon-
ceivable rapidity

disruptor tubes in hand the beleagured
explorers advanced toward the passage their
only chance being to blast a path to safety
the jellied bodies drew together solidly
blocking the way simultaneously joe and
al pressed the triggers of their weapons
the long pale beams sprang out impinged
upon the heaving forms

a cry of despair burst involuntarily from
both men the disruptor rays had abso-
lutely no effect upon these creatures mat-
ter was differently constituted here - earth
forces were unable to break up these atoms

all was lost the end of the great ad-
venture was near in great waves the green
terrors advanced desperately the men
searched about for some opening some gap
through which to seek escape there was
none enringed they stood at bay defense-
less now that the disruptor tubes potent
weapons of destruction on earth were use-
less

as disaster bore down upon them als
thoughts flashed back to the commencement
of their flight the vast crowds gathered to
see them off-aspirants for the great million
dollar prize to the space navigators who first
explored the pale planet pluto enigma of
the solar system

almost was the prize within their grasp
another few hundred million miles and they
would have reached pluto but now they
were thrown into this now they were
doomed never to return or bear witness to
the wonders they had seen

a clammy yielding tentacle encircled his
body dragging him down joe too was
struggling in the grip of an amorphous mon-
ster desperately they fought but to no
avail even as they broke through one
the emperor of the stars



grip another viscid tentacle would flow over
them already they were being engulfed
into the bodies of these creatures what a
horrible end-to be ingested alive-to be
dissolved in the digestive fluids of this hor-
ribly strange green beings

even as the two had given up all hope
were weltering at the bottom of a mass of
viscid clammy matter there was a sudden
change a shudder ran through the mon-
strous jelly engulfing them the horrible
stuff flowed away they were left lying
there stunned suffocated senses reeling in-
to oblivion but still alive

strange beings

slowly life flowed back into the ad-
venturers what had brought about
this sudden change what had saved them
from certain extinction they raised their
heads then dropped them with simultaneous
groans what nightmare was this they
were living through impossible the
things they had seen again they looked
about them true enough two shapes were
standing there but what shapes

two orange dome-shaped creatures
somewhat like diving bells the front of
each bell was flattened and in the center
was a huge oval opening covered by a
translucent mica-like substance directly
over and on each side of the opening pro-
truded two antennae at the end of which
were round faceted knobs

beneath the orifice were two long wav-
ing tentacles ending in two opposing spatu-
lates the whole dome or bell rested on
innumerable little jointed legs the crea-
tures were able to travel with a fair de-
gree of rapidity altogether they were not
over three feet in height

joe and al sprang to their feet in the
distance they could see a swelling mass of
the green jelly-creatures that had so nearly
done for them driving them on with green
flashes from tubular weapons held in their
tentacles moved a horde of queer beings
similar to the two immediately in front of
them

holy mackerel joe exploded these
things have saved our lives alright but what

the devil are they bird beast or devil
do you see the same thing as i al or have
i gone daffy

but al was not listening he had been
watching the forms intently look he
cried gripping joes arm look at that
will you

on the translucent mica-like coverings
over the orifices appeared reddish charac-
ters there were four of them delicate in-
tricate tracings lit up by some interior
fire they resembled somewhat the old
cuneiform writing of the babylonians or
the egyptian hieroglyphics even as the
earth-men watched with bated breath the
glyphs vanished and others different in
form took their place

al was greatly excited i believe theyre
trying to communicate with us that mem-
brane is a screen on which they can flash
symbols that represent their language just
as we do in printing

then how in blazes are we going to talk
to them wonder if they can hear joe
cupped his hands and shouted a great hel-
lo

there was not the slightest movement to
show that they had heard but at the gesture
strange fiery characters danced and changed
with great rapidity on the screens

joe was disgusted what are we to do
now draw pictures for them

that isnt such a bad idea declared
al but first well try pantomime
accordingly he pointed to the open door-
way up through which they had come and
then with a sweep of his arm denoted their
travels through far space

for the first time the creatures showed
excitement they shuffled their innumer-
able feet and waved their long tentacle
arms one of them propelled itself like a
huge centipede to the jade slab and quickly
shut it on the screen of the other there
flashed a scene-the deep blue of space in
which whirled innumerable worlds

now it was al who danced excitedly
there you are joe he cried theyre
making pictures for us moving pictures
just what you spoke of so contemptuously
see theyve understood me he nodded
his head vigorously in confirmation


wonder stories

evidently this gesture was also compre-
hended for the picture changed to one in
which the earth-men beheld themselves es-
corted along an alabaster road

they want us to go with them al think
it safe

safe echoed al scornfully why they
couldnt hold me back miss up examining
this civilization i should say not

all right all right joe retorted good
naturedly keep your shirt on im going
just thought id ask

al in pantomime declared his willingness
to go with them immediately one trotted
ahead while the other moved along with
the two adventurers

for a long time they moved across the
black and dismal plain swept clear now
of the grim green menaces that so nearly
had been their doom then they came to a
precipitous ascent up which a roughly
hewed road spiralled breathless the
earth-men reached the top then they
stopped thunderstruck

they were gazing down upon a rolling
landscape that gently undulated and curved
upwards until lost in the haze a warm
golden orange glow enveloped the scene in
a glamorous bath overhead shone the
source of the illumination-a mild kindly
orange sun whose rays were not too dazz-
ling

below them stretched a view that made
them catch their breaths

a long curving snow-white road led down
into a deep valley filling the hollow was
a vast city a golden gleaming city of round-
ed shapes immense structures domes div-
ing bells magnified duplicates of their in-
habitants

joe was the first to break the silence
this is something like these people must
have considerable brains and skill to build
that wonderful city

al said nothing but broke into a rapid
walk so fast this his guides could barely
keep up with him  as for joe good lord
man hold on a bit im not in training
for cross-country you know

unwillingly al slowed his pace the
true explorers fervor blazed in him as

they descended into the valley they began
to meet more and more of the strange deni-
zens without exception each one that they
met stopped short in his tracks bright red
symbols chasing each other intricately over
his translucent screen to be met with ans-
wering hieroglyphics from their guides

sort of giving them the low down on us
joe explained it invariably the curious
one fell in behind until by the time they
entered the city they were accompanied
by a veritable guard of honor

on a broad white highway between the
golden domes mosaics of intricate designs
in which gold predominated went the pro-
cession a weird soundless procession ex-
cept for the slight rustle of innumerable lit- 
tie feet

it struck joe for the first time say al
have you noticed that there is no noise in
this world none of the usual sounds were
accustomed to positively uncanny i
think

it struck me too these people cannot
speak and evidently cannot hear either
because of the silence in nature were
there natural sounds or poises evolution
would have equipped them also with the
necessary apparatus

just then their guides swung onto a long
ramp that led into a dome more magnificent
than the rest guards at the entrance
armed with gleaming tridents permitted
them to enter and promptly barred the way
to the unofficial escort

the vast interior was crowded with pros-
taks the name of these bell-shaped people
on a raised platform at the farther end
stood one taller than the rest in one ten-
tacle he carried a great trident whose prongs
darted golden flames near him stood con-
temptuously-if such earth terms could be
applied to so strange a being-an elongated
cylinder entirely enclosed in a deep blue
shimmering aura lifeless though it seem-
ed purely geometric its form-yet the ex-
plorers sensed immediately the presence of
a living force-a malignant evil influence
that caused their flesh to prickle with name-
less shudders

good god that damned cylinder is the
center of something horrible joe al ex-
the emperor of the stars



claimed involuntarily i feel it in my
bones these other people-i know they
are kindly gentle folk i can sense it even
though they are so different from us but
that over -there it gives me the creeps

joe nodded soberly i had the same feel-
ing as soon as i saw it im afraid were
going to have trouble with that beastly fig-
ure before were through and these inhab-
itants i think they already have felt the
force of its deviltry

chapter iii
a silent drama

even as he spoke the blue aura enfold-
ing the cylinder began to flicker
streamers shot out from it long ones then
short then long evidently a sort of morse
code

the imposing prostak on the platform
whom the earth-men already recognized as
the ruler or king over these people faced
the other being with what seemed the great-
est attention

when the flickering streamers ceased the
ruler bowed submissively instantly all the
prostaks in the hall tossed their tentacles
about wildly shuffled their little feet while
on the screens dashed a perfect frenzy of
symbols the uncanny silence was unbrok-
en but joe and a looked at each other
both had felt it immense waves of lamen-
tation exuded into the vitalized atmosphere
-these people were suffering intensely
within the earth-mens breasts hearts ham-
mered suffocatingly under the surge of an
immense pity

al joe whispered hoarsely his eyes
suspiciously wet

what is it responded al in a queer
choked voice

theres something damnable going on
here

al nodded fiercely i know it-i feel
it

joe continued hurriedly that alien cy-
linder has just made some filthy demand on
that big fellow-the ruler here-and he was
forced to give in and all these poor peo-
ple are crying inwardly-they havent even

the consolation of honest-to-goodness tears
and wailing that we have some frightful
doom is hanging over them

wish we could do something to help
hold your horses al mustnt go off
half cocked wait until we learn a bit more
about things here before we butt in

their attention was once more attracted to
the ivory platform the ruler was motion-
ing with his huge trident to a group of
guards armed with smaller tridents

instantly the guards set in motion down
through the crowded hall they moved the
prostaks shrinking and shuffling away from
them with every evidence of terrible fright
suddenly the guards swooped and six fran-
tically struggling figures were borne bodily
to the platform the ruler emanated inut-
terable sadness and a host of pallid red
glyphs flashed in rapid succession on the
thought screen afterwards the earth-men
found they could detect the mental mood of
the prostaks from the depth of color of these
symbols when the prostak was cheerful
and gay the characters danced a brilliant
red when sad or uneasy the red was dulled
and pallid

the guards carried their writhing victims
down the length of the hall and out into the
open the vast concourse of people bowed
down almost to the ground their long spatu-
lated tentacles waving wildly heart-break-
ingly

the cylinder stood erect as though con-
templating the despairing people was that
a mocking leer that subtly emanated from
it joe could have sworn it was instinc-
tively his hand reached for the revolver in
his pocket he had a wild desire to shoot
down that alien tyrant

al saw his movement and gripped his
arm just in time for gods sake joe stop
it are you mad you dont know what
its all about and besides youre liable to
expose us to some terrible danger by your
foolhardiness wait -until we learn more
about whats happening

grumbling joe allowed himself to be
persuaded he returned the weapon to its
place i know damn well what its all
about that -grinning leering cylinder-
id like to shoot it full of holes and see


wonder stories

what its made of but i suppose youre
right--wed better wait and get acquainted
first notwithstanding his acquiescence he
sighed regretfully

the blue cylinder began to flick out a
message once more the king bowed in
token of submission then the blue flames
increased in volume until the baleful cylin-
der was only faintly visible suddenly it
shot up into the air circled about the hall
three times a derisive gesture joe thought
then darted straight for the roof of the
dome without hesitation it plunged
through the solid stone as though it were
non-existent and disappeared a nameless
oppression a foreboding of ultimate doom
lifted from the travelers hearts with its
passing

wrapped as they were in the mighty
drama just terminated no one had
noticed the intrusion of these two visitors
from another universe but now the pros-
taks discovered their presence and once
more excitement resumed its sway the hall
was filled with inquisitive waving tentacles
and their pictured remarks glowed with a
livelier red

the ruler raised his body at the turmoil
and saw the cause of it you could almost
see his start of surprise he held his golden
trident aloft the two guides heretofore
discreetly in the background now pushed
forward the earth-men followed

a rapid exchange passed between the
guides and their king then he turned to
his visitors and raising his trident aloft
waved it three times al who was already
almost en rapport with this strange race
said to joe hes evidently welcoming
us

then picture began to flash on the oval
screen intently they watched they saw
themselves being led through long corridors
to a great hall filled with bizarre machines
busily attended by proslaks looks like a
scientific laboratory to me joe he wants
us to communicate with their scientists
then they watched themselves going to other
chambers where food was served and ulti-
mately to a place where they stood motion-

less in fixed attitudes when the pictures
went blank

that must be their sleeping quarters
they must sleep standing up in fact i
cant see how they could lie down if they
wanted to interjected joe proud of his
acumen

al attempted in pantomime to show he
understood the king waved his trident
once more and two guards appeared rang-
ing on either side of the explorers they led
them down a long corridor into a chamber
full of queer apparatus exactly as had been
pictured to them the scientist prostaks came
forward to greet them

it would serve no good purpose to enter
into a lengthy discussion of the methods
employed to establish understandable com-
munication between the representatives of
these so alien races the slow and tortuous
stumbling before a fair degree of success
was attained

suffice it to say that the earth-men dis-
covered that the symbols employed by the
prostaks were conventionalized ideographs
having originally been exact representa-
tions of objects and actions they never
were able to find out just by what living
internal mechanism these beings were able
to flash their pictures or glyphs on the sensi-
tive screen as for the earth-mens com-
munication with them al who was a clever
sketcher and fortunately had a note book
and pencil along with him employed his
talent with great success that and panto-
mime did the trick until the men learned the
prostak language and the meaning of the
symbols then matters progressed smooth-
ly for they could sketch the characters to
express their thoughts

almost the first question they asked when
understanding was established was an ex-
planation of that terrible drama in the hall
of the ruler

the chief scientist told them the story

	  

in the center of the universe he said
there existed a mighty ruler a being who

strangely enough resembled most closely
the earth-men

when he had come no one knew but
many pilasters ago a pilaster is ten months
and twenty-one days a vast transparent
sphere had floated into their space inside
the hollow shell bathed in blue light was
observed the queer human creature a
maze of strange instruments surrounded him
whose use the prostak scientists watching
eagerly through the funnel orifices with pow-
erful telescopes were unable to fathom

fyen as they gazed the strange being
manipulated various levers and great
streamers of cold blue light shot out into
the black void of space until the entire uni-
verse was luminescent with the glaring blue
flames

to the amazed view of the prostaks there
were illumined innumerable dark worlds
similar to their own of the existence of
these they had been apprised for ages by
means of mental communication with the
inhabitants but this was the first time the
orbs had become visible in the interiors
were peoples and civilizations comparable to
that of the prostaks by a system of thought
transference the races pf these hollow orbs
could communicate with each other

the history of a race

but some few of the rolling balls in
space were uninhabited possibly they
thought these barren worlds were solid
throughout and therefore unable to support
life

attempts to establish communication with
the strange new creature in the hollow trans-
parent shell were unsuccessful at length
they resigned themselves to watching for
further developments these were not long
in coming the great sphere moved method-
ically from one to another of the dark solid
worlds in front of each it rested motion-
less in space the man creature busied
himself with his instruments pale beams
impinged steadily on the lifeless hulks until
to the watchers vast astonishment a deeper
blue haze strangely resembling an atmos-
phere enveloped the dark spheres un-
believably it seemed to cling to the surface

instead of being violently repelled into
space

the scientists puzzled over the meaning of
these strange events without success soon
too soon were they to realize the full horror
of this irruption into their hitherto peaceful
universe

one day they noticed that the strange
enclosed being was exceptionally active
instrument after instrument whirled and
gyrated suddenly an elongated cylinder
of blue flame leaped into life passed
through the transparency as though it did
not exist darted through space straight to-
ward a sister world with barely percepti-
ble pause it shot through a tunnel opening
and disappeared into the interior

agog with excitement the prostaks at-
tuned themselves to the thought waves of
the orb to learn the meaning of this strange
invasion they were not long left in the
dark	

the cylinder of blue flame was demanding
that a certain number of the arkabs the
name of that race be placed in elongated
cylinders of its masters contriving whom
it called the emperor of the stars and
ejected into the void they were to be
drawn to the new worlds so strangely made
livable by the emperor there to live and
die as slaves working his will tilling the
barren soil to grow the curious foods neces-
sary for the well-being of the self-constitut-
ed emperor as the population grew from
the enslaved beings of this and other worlds
certain secret plans were to be made effec-
tive if they refused the direst retribution
was threatened

scornfully the rulers of their sister world
had rejected the barbarous terms the
strange cylinder betook itself haughtily back
to its master

what followed was dreadful first the
heavens turned an intense blue then lum-
inous blue streamers shot athwart the sky
rapidly they approached the doomed world
they touched enveloped it before the fas-
cinated watchers eyes it seemed to crumble
to disintegrate when the terrible blue rayg

the probtake were not acquainted with the phenomoutt
of attraction-burns  pries


wonder stories

withdrew the great world was gone-whif-
fed clean out of existence

since that demonstration of power no
world dared refuse its tribute rapidly the
desolate worlds were populated by slaves
from many spheres by some strange power
they remained on the surface and did not
tumble off into the void many pilasters
passed wearily hopelessly the slaves
could be seen toiling digging performing
strange tasks under the cruel supervision f
the emperors minions the cylinders of blue

unknown growths appeared on the
ground were harvested and carried in long
cylinders to the glassy shell of the emperor
strange oblong structures reared their
heads on the colonized worlds vast new cit-
ies of new shapes and forms more and more
slaves were demanded and procured from
the subject races for the emperor had found
work for them digging minerals that he
needed refining them etc

heretofore the prostaks had been unmol-
ested they grew confident in their im-
munity they were exempt from the killing
toll not for them the ghastly pall that
overhung the denizens of other orbs

then suddenly like the crack of dftom
appeared the frightful messenger of the
emperor in the universal sign language
he had made his demand for slaves six
prostaks were to be supplied regularly each
dinaster corresponding roughly to nine
days

after prolonged consultation one pros-
tak greatly daring had volunteered to
speed through space to intercede with the
emperor direct he had departed it was
his cylinder joe and al had seen leaving the
surface of prostakon almost immediately
the messenger of the emperor had reappear-
ed in the council chamber gloatingly it
had told of the enslavement of the hero am-
bassador then it had repeated the inex-
orable demand for tribute reminded the
horror-struck prostaks of the fate of that
other world that had dared to defy the
emperor

there was nothing to do but submit the
earth-men had witnessed the frightful scene
f their seizure and the universal lamenta-

tion of this gentle kindly people what
they had not seen was the thrusting of the
struggling victims into a cylinder awaiting
them at the exit into outer space and their
ejection here the narrator paused the
hieroglyphics fading to the dullest red of
despondency

in a dreshiar more slightly less than two
days another six of the wretched inhabi-
tants must be sent to join the tribute from
other worlds to glut the greed of the dread
emperor already the terrified prostaks
were fleeing the city fearful that they might
be seized in the next batch to go

no longer would there be peace and the
ordered pursuit of knowledge the scientist
concluded sadly now and forever the
people would be under the dreadful doom
none knowing whose turn was next there
was no hope but ultimate extinction

the earth-men had watched the pictured
story with growing horror until the last
symbol had faded away their hearts bled
at the thought of this gentle race so ad-
vanced in culture and achievements fated
to be the slaves to the ambitions of an alien
lord

simultaneously they looked at each other
each read the resolve in the others eyes

al wrote for the aged prostak all may
not be as hopeless as you think possibly
we may be able to find some means to com-
bat the fiend

startled the scientist waved his antenna
in a flickering hope but then the dulled red
characters appeared nay no one can hope
to overcome him he is mighty the em-
peror of the stars we are only finite be-
ings he is omnipotent-no puny weapon
of ours can harm him alas i am afraid
our bitter destiny must be fulfilled

in the world from which we come noth-
ing is recognized as impossible al replied
though we cannot promise we say again
hope on perhaps we shall be able to re-
quite your kindness by delivering your na-
tion from this menace

with that they left the unconvinced scien-
tist

chapter iv

we shall go

mitt hat have you in mind asked joe
 v eagerly as they returned to their
quarters id give a great deal to release
these people from their horrible fate ive
honestly come to like them quite a bit
you may think its damnably rash and
dangerous al answered slowly what im
going to propose and it is no question
about it but i feel the same way about the
prostaks as you do and i for one am willing
to take the chance here it is	

you remember what the old prostak told
us about this emperor how strangely he
resembles us in form that he is an alien
to this universe and more particularly that
he is able to endow matter with gravita-
tional attraction instead of the universal
repulsion it has here it occurs to me that
possibly this potent emperor is a being from
some planet in our own system or even-it
is not too fantastic-a man from our own
earth he might have been a scientist of
extraordinary attainments who had in secret
discovered and developed new natural forces
as yet unknown to us

an overweening ambition may have led
him to the idea of conquering the planets of
our solar system with the forces under his
control accordingly he built his vast hol-
low shell which from the description seems
to be made of pure fused quartz

launching himself secretly into space
he intended to overpower and render subject
each planet in turn some freak of destiny
just as in our case led him to the exact
tangential point with this universe and pre-
cipitated him through

adjusting himself quickly to the new
conditions he set about enslaving these kind-
ly peaceful peoples now he is creating
new worlds in the image of that one with
which he was familiar	

can you conceive the upshot a vast
horde of trained submissive subjects with
which to win back to our universe i dare
not picture the fate of poor old earth al
shuddered at the vivid image he himself
had conjured up

joe became excited that settles it we
must conquer this scientist emperor not
only for the sake of the prostaks but for
that of our own world but how

ive thought of something just as our
weapons proved ineffective against the alien
matter and reversed natural laws of this
universe so the weapons of the denizens
were unavailing against this marauder from
our universe on the other hand our wea-
pons may prove useful against this being
who was originally subject to the laws of
our space of course al continued this
is all guesswork on my part i may be ab-
solutely wrong but somehow i am con-
vinced that we shall be able to defeat the
emperor of the stars

but you still havent told me what meth-
od of attack you expect to use objected
joe

all was the prompt retort  if i knew
exactly the nature of the emperor i could
specify but as i dont well use every
available method and trust to luck that one

ii	the right one we have our ray projec-
tors our atomic disruptors our rocket
bursts one of these may be successful
who knowsx

im game to try it anyway joe declar-
ed the worst that can happen is that we
dont come back and i for one am not too
keen about spending the rest of my days
here no matter how decent the prostaks are
after all theyre not our kind and i also
have a hunch-laugh if you will-that our
only chance of ever returning is connected
in some ay with this emperor of theirs
al nodded ive also had the same feel-
ing its agreed then everything on the
ships just as we left it im sure so every-
thing is in readiness

	  

nce more the two earth-men stood in
the great hall once more the ruler
stood sadly on the platform again the
mocking malevolent cylinder radiated blue
emanations on the right side of the king
the fatal day had come for the second tri-
bute the great hall was nearly empty
almost every one-had fled only the offi-
cials the scientists were present-those
whose pride or abounding courage did not


wonder stories

permit them to seek safety in flight even
though they stood their ground who can
say they were not desperately afraid

once more the cylinder made its foul de-
mand again with bowed body the troubled
ruler acquiesced his trident was raised
aloft in signal to the guards to perform their
odious duty the very bravest shrank away
in dread anticipation-when suddenly the
evil ambassador stood erect shot a blue ray
in the direction of the earth-men as though
in triumphant inquiry then flashed staccato
streamers toward the prostak ruler

	al had learned to read this code also
an exclamation of horror froze on his lips

what is it joe wanted to know

he is demanding that we two be a part
of the tribute al cried

my god were cooked done for
groaned joe

just then the ruler raised his body proud-
ly erect and angry vivid red hieroglyphics
chased each other rapidly across his thought
screen

al dug his fingers deep into joes arm
joyfully half unbelieving

my god joe the old boy is a wonder
know what hes saying to that damned cy-
linder hes answering that we are his
guests-the guests of the prostaks never
in all their history have they ever permitted
harm to befall any strangers any aliens
who once had shared their hospitality
and he doesnt intend starting now he
will not deliver us to destruction and the
cylinder and his master can be damned to
it al was translating rather freely in his
excitement rather his whole world be
consumed by the tyrant than accede to this
infernal demand

a wave of soundless applause broke from
the assembled prostaks even though the de-
fiant speech of their king spelled certain
destruction to all of them

joes eyes positively blazed al its
wonderful inconceivable the nobility of this
race think of our people on earth and
what they would say and do in a similar
situation al he gripped his friend
tightly with sudden alarm youre not go-
ing to let them sacrifice themselves like that
to save us are yoi

the reply was emphatic i should say
not

meanwhile the blue cylinder was sputter-
ing an angry message very well then it
threatened it would report to its master
and retribution would be swift and terrible

hold on a moment al cried out dart-
ing forward forgetting in his excitement
that no one could hear him joe was close
behind him

recollecting himself al dashed to a niche
in the wall where was kept for him the thin
black square and red chalk-like substance he
used for conversation in public

quickly he dragged them out and set to
work to convey his message forgetful of
all else in the tense drama of the moment
the prostaks eagerly crowded about the pair

noble ruler of the prostaks al sketch-
ed hastily we deeply appreciate your un-
exampled sacrifice but we cannot permit
it this fair world of yours shall not be
destroyed because of us no we are ready
to go as tribute to this insatiable emperor
-this monster of your universe we visit-
ors from another space are not afraid of
him

all over the vast hall on one and all
danced in vivid red the single legend iter-
ated and reiterated no no no

what a race murmured joe exultantly

again al fiercely sketched we thank
you-it is worthy of you but our minds
are made up we shall go tell that dam-
nable cylinder we shall be ready

sadly the ruler bowed to their wishes
in symbols barely visible he informed the
ambassador of their acquiescence

a million to one chance

there was no question of it now the
blue cylinder flared in leering triumph
once more it sprang up through the ceiling
to speed the news to its powerful master

left to themselves the prostaks tossed
their tentacles in soundless uproar they
were expostulating angrily with their visit-
ors for this violation of their ancient hospi-
tality with difficulty al managed to con-
centrate their attention to his writing

this once accomplished however they
the emperor of the stars



followed him closely without interruption
he explained just what he and joe had in
mind their plans for battle with the dread
lord and the possible freeing of the uni-
verse for all time from its frightful doom
tjjey would go alone in their own space
ship to meet him in his very lair the center
of his power

when he was done a tremendous demon-
stration took place the prostaks grabbed
drowningly at the straw just offered who
knew-perhaps these aliens from outside
their space might prove the saviors of their
world

immediately a vast procession formed to
escort the daring earth-men to the place
where their ship was moored as they
moved along more and more of the pros-
taks flocked out of their hiding places ap-
prised by swift broadcasting of the meaning
of the march

theyre treating us like conquering he-
roes already joe smiled wryly at al but
to tell you the truth i dont feel like one
at all my knees are just a bit wobbly at
the thought of whats ahead of us

buck up old man al encouraged him
the worst that can happen is death we
must chance it and i feel rather confi-
dent we can turn the trick

im not backing out joe replied ear-
nestly im with you to the bitter end

i know you are old fellow al said
affectionately

at last the procession reached the en-
trance hall of their first acquaintance in
the presence of their awestruck friends they
donned the space suits and descended the
long ramp to the lower trap door opening
it they peered dowp into the funnel and
beheld their good old space flier still faith-
fully swinging as they had left it

the prostak scientists crowded at the trap
door to gaze curiously at the strange contri-
vance of their visitors then the last fare-
wells were said between these members of
alien races-the earth-men were choked with
emotion-and they screwed their helmets in
place

the last they ever saw of this noble gen-
tle people as the trap closed were the waving

k

tentacles and flaming characters equivalent
to god speed

into the air lock they passed the mech-
anism functioned smoothly and once more
they found themselves in the familiar inter-
ior of the ship ready to start on the most
tremendous the strangest adventure ever
undertaken by mortal men

the grapples were cast off immediate-
ly the space ship left the surface rap-
idly the velocimeter needle passed up the
dial indicating greater and greater speed
through the vastj-eaches of unknown space
the devoted craft sped fast in the grip of a
force whose nature was unfathomable

the adventurers were sober now the
lively curiosity which had hitherto sus-
tained them through the strange experiences
which had thus far been their lot was now
overlaid by the knowledge that they were
starting out to combat a vast and terrible
unknown in this weird universe infinitely
far from all that was familiar they were
challenging an obscene power a power so
great that it had subjugated an infinity of
worlds had dominated them and levied hor-
rible tribute upon them was it conceiva-
ble that these two puny men in their mid-
get ship could successfully meet and con-
quer so great a power

with a wry grin al spoke joe i think
we are the prize fools of two universes
why should we risk ourselves in this at-
tempt for the sake of worlds which are not
even of our own universe my wild sur-
mise as to the danger to our own space is
far-fetched lets think it over again be-
fore its too late we can still turn aside-
find another sphere where conditions are
suitable for ourvexistence-and pass the rest
of our days in comfort what do you say

the usually flippant joe was very sub-
dued now gravely he replied you know
i dislike heroics al melodramatic speech-
es arent in my line at all but isnt this a
glorious way to die if die we must to
set out two little men in a little ship to
battle the master of a universe just think
what is the alternative to land in one
of these strange globes to rot away our
lives in an alien atmosphere


wonder stories

that may suit you i dont want to pass
out that way rather fail but fail glor-
iously in this great adventure this wild
quixotic attempt to free a universe from
slavery come al pep up i know whats
on your mind v you feel that you got me
into this and it worries you forget it
when i joined up i knew that the chances
were a thousand to one against our ever
getting back theyre a million to one now
what of it funny thing ive got a hunch
that well win through yet

fries stuck out his hand grasped that of
his friend in gratitude jthanks joe i feel
better now i did think that i had gotten
you into something that i had no right to
now that i know how you take it i can
carry on well win through yet they cant
lick us lets go

onward ever onward the space-ship
rushed the speed was terrific  black
spheres rushed by with the speed of light
ever brighter ever more intense grew the
blue of the firmament a dull sense of
foreboding settled down on the two friends
an oppressive sense of awe

at last there came a time when the tre-
mendous velocity of their progress began
to slacken by this time the glaring blue
illumination had grown so intense that it was
necessary to keep the portholes thickly cov-
ered only a tiny slit had been left through
which eyes protected by thick-covered gog-
gles the adventurers took fleeting glimpses
of the space around them for long now
they had passed beyond the last vestige of
the dark worlds of this universe there
was nothing without but that intense blue
glare

slower and slower the ship seemed to
hover in that interminable emptiness a
mere  miles per second was the speed
indicated by the meter which al had ad-
justed to the new condition of this new
space a mere  miles per second but
ever onward toward the unknown menace

bulking in the firmament ahead now ap-
peared the thing they had sped to combat
the vast transparent shell of the emperor of
the stars a huge hollow sphere it was al-
most a thousand feet across of fused clear
quartz the walls tremendously thick

chapter v

the emperor of the stars

in the center of the great hollow floated a
disk that almost reached across the glbe
on it appeared a hive of great machines and
apparatus giant pistons slid back and
forth huge vacuum tubes glowed with elect-
ronic discharges motors and dynamos were
surging with power bathing all and puls-
ing out into the unfathomable space was the
strange blue glare

no sign of sentient life only the mach-
ines that spun and flared interminably

an exclamation from al as he peered
through the telescope brought joe to the oth-
er eyepiece of the binocular there on the
platform out of a cabin-like affair walked-
a man an earth-man too no doubt about
about it a weazened shrivelled creature
with straggly white hair and deep furrowed
cheeks but the eyes-they were burning
coals aflame with relentless cruelty once
they lifted up in the direction of the onrush-
ing space ship and the hearts of the watch-
ers skipped a beat evidently they were too
far away to be visible for the evil eyes
turned indifferently away and the emperor
busied himself about his apparatus

joe turned an awed look on al gosh
but you hit the nail on the head all right
if i werent with you all the time id think
you had sneaked a look at this bird before
you concocted your deductions

just a lucky guess al decried modestly
but let me tell you something just be-
cause this bird is a human being just like
ourselves doesnt mean that were not in
for the fight of our lives he looks puny
enough but hes possessed of undreamt-of
powers im very much afraid our weapons
will prove no match for those which he
commands

well a man can die but once joe res-
ponded philosophically

slower and slower drifted the space ship
and now here and there in the weird blue
light dark specks appeared floating silent-
ly in that immensity at first they thought
them worlds-tiny    far off    but
when the telescope was focussed on the black
the emperor of the stars



objects they proved to be elongated cy-
linders the cylinders in which the tribute
slaves were being carried to the emperors
domain nearer and nearer they plunged
irresistably drawn to the great quartz sphere

one came rushing by then on beyond in
headlong plunge straight into the efful-
gent radiance it dived then suddenly a sec-
tion of the quartz shell swung open the cy-
linder sped in the section slid simultan-
eously back into position

with bated breath the daring adventurers
waited to see what would happen next

the cylinder floated directly to the plat-
form came to a quivering halt against a
huge plate evidently a powerful magnet
the old man swiftly pressed a button the
head of the cylinder opened on a hinge a
nozzle directly opposite sprayed a liquid
into the interior

chloroform or something like it ha-
zarded joe

then a mechanical arm reached in pulled
out one by one six denizens of some world
of this universe akin in general structure to
the prostaks

gloatingly the evil scientist surveyed the
limp unconscious forms then with a
strength amazing in one so frail looking
he lifted a body -to what seemed to be an
operating table a huge hypodermic ap-
peared in his hand the keen point pierced
the outer tissue of the helpless unfortunate
and the contents squirted home

joes eyes were glued to the telescope in
horror know what the old beast is do-
ing he shouted excitedly to al inject-
ing some fiendish solution into their brains
to make them submissive slaves to his evil
will come on i cant stand watching it
any longer lets get him before he works
on the others

hold your horses al raised his voice
in warning were liable to hit sudden
death if you keep going off half-cocked lets
see what happens further before we attack
maybe we can get a line on his vulnerable
points

again and again the ghastly operation
was repeated then the yet unconscious
creatures were replaced in the metallic cy-
linder lid clamped into place the em-

peror pulled a switch the cylinder moved
swiftly off the platform darted through an
automatically opening section and vanished
into the blue empyrean

headed straight for one of the slave
worlds commented al grimly well have
to get busy now check up on the disruptor
tube joe

mounted on the outer housing of the
space ship a great tube thrust its
copper nose menacingly forth latest pro-
duct of the scientific skill of the earth it
had done yeoman service in dissipating the
clouds of wandering meteors that had dis-
puted the passage of the spheroid through
space would it avail now against this
super-scientist emperor of the stars

it was joe who noticed it first my
god al were moving fast again and tow-
ards the sphere

al sprang to the instrument panel sure
enough they were caught in a vast attrac-
tion force were being drawn irresistibly to
the enemy quick joe let loose the for-
ward rockets to hold us back while he
sprang to the trigger of the disruptor tube

in an instant the rockets let loose their
fierce surge of power the staunch ship
trembled with the force of the reaction the
velocimeter needle hesitated slid backward
a trifle then slowly remorselessly crept for-
ward again into full speed ahead the
mighty attraction was overpowering their
puny efforts

now for the first time as they rushed
closer the weazened emperor looked up saw
the oncoming space ship al taut at the
telescope saw the startled blaze of recogni-
tion to be succeeded by a maniacal glare of
hatred the bloodless lips curled into a
soundless screech the man darted for a huge
lever reached it threw it with all his might

a blinding blue flame scorched through
the firmament straight for them franti-
cally al swerved the ship a cataclysmic
glare the crash of a thousand thunderbolts
a ripping tearing sound as the blue death
seared the side of the space flier had it
not been for the sudden swerve the fight
would have been over then and there

now al shouted and the great disrup-


wonder stories

tor tube roared its electronic discharge a
section of the shell buckled and melted at
the impact but the quartz was too tremen-
dously thick it was not more than one
quarter penetrated

meanwhile the death rays were darting in
continuous streams about their devoted ship
the rocket tubes the electronic projector
roared deafeningly the air within the flier
was bursting with the terrific tumult

 another blinding flash a shattering crash
another ray had found its mark sheared off
in its glancing flight a stout metal plate
how long could this one-sided combat con-
tinue it was only a question of time be-
fore a death ray would hit its target square-
ly and then-

desperately joe worked at the controls
twisted and turned the ship in irregular zig-
zag dashes al pumped the trigger of the
disruptor tube in continuous bursts all
over the face of the great transparent sphere
the quartz shattered and pitted but still
there was no break

the eyes of the straggly haired emperor
envenomed triumphantly as he reached for
another lever immediately the staunch ship
twisted and groaned in torment a giant
force seized and crushed it the metal plates
were straining buckling under the tremen-
dous pressure a few minutes and the
great steel rivets would be sheared from
their holes

white lipped al ceased his aimfcss fir-
ing in all the hellish tumult he forced his
weary brain into activity there was only
one chance in a million emulate the wood-
pecker he thought grimly

coolly methodically he put his plan
into action while the blue flames
leaped and crashed about them while the
ship shuddered in the grip of that hellish
force he carefully trained the disruptor
gun on one spot on thegreat quartz shell
steadily he loosed the stream of electrons
steadily he swerved the gun with the gyra-
tions of the ship to cover the rapidly deep-
ening pit as the deadly discharge pecked
and pecked away

the emperor looked up saw the havoc
for the first time there was a gleam of fear

in the hate-crazed eyes the pressure in-
creased the blue death crashed and roared
but al was not to be diverted all his be-
ing was concentrated in breaking through
that one point

the quartz was fusing wearing thin the
emperor saw the danger sprang to a new
machine al rubbed his eyes in amazement
gave vent to a great shout of jubilation

by jingo hes licked hes turning tail
and running for it

weve won boy weve won joe beat
his friends shoulder in an ecstasy of joy
not yet came the grim reply

why what do you mean demanded
joe arent we here alive unhurt hes
had enough hasnt he

thats true enough better than i anti-
cipated but you forget what we set out to
do rid this universe of his evil tyranny
hes still alive in full control of his forces
unless youve had enough im going after
to finish him

by jove youre right lets go weve
got him on the run

and so these indomitable earth-men not
content with having successfully escaped al-
most inevitable doom sent their vessel hurt-
ling after the retreating menace rockets
blazing green flashing disruptor tube pro-
jecting its coruscating ray the spheroid
darted across the sky straight for the vast
shell it plunged straight into the fierce blue
light

but the enemy was a beaten thing his
courage was gone he could but turn and
flee rushing across the vast stretches of
space with the earth ship darting after him
worrying harrying what a spectacle it
was this cosmic flight across infinite space
the great bulk streaking its mass across the
empyrean with the baffled emperor crouch-
ed in a frenzy of agony on the platform
gazing ever backward at his pursuer the
midge darting after plunging biting harry-
ing slicing ever pecking away at the doom-
ed spot

did the prostak scientists watch the
transcendental spectacle in their powerful
telescopes if so what joy there must have
been in that world what a waving of tenta-
cles what a shimmering procession of bright
the emperor of the stars



red glyphs across their strange communica-
tion disks how that orange glowing air
must have vibrated to emanations of joy and
of thankfulness

the blue light was growing dim the vic-
tory was almost complete at last with
startling suddenness the end came a final
roaring electronic stream and the last thin
layer of quartz buckled and broke a blind-
ing burst and the great shell smashed into
a million flying sparks all space was
filled with blazing coruscating debris the
awed earth men caught a last glimpse of the
doomed emperor his eyes filled with unut-
terable horror and then-there was black-
ness blessed unrelieved blackness the em-
peror of the stars was dead

joe shut off the rockets al released the
trigger-lever of the ray with unutterable
thankfulness the two turned to one another
gripped hands in silent congratulation then
characteristically the incident was closed

what now tn this interstellar black-
ness unrelieved by any stars what will be-
come of us seems like weve hopped from
a burning plane to a blazing forest thus
al expressed it

pessimist as usual after all weve got-
ten through so far my bet is that well get
back home somehow i cant believe that
after our miraculous escapes from the dan-
gers that have threatened us since we found
ourselves in this space we are doomed to
drift endlessly-

joe was interrupted by a blinding flash of
white light from without a sudden violent
lurch of the craft both men rushed to

look without to discover wkaf new danger

threatened them

a moment of stunned silence the men
looked at each other then out again at-
the stars stars myriads of them soft-
ly almost reverently al spoke

joe look at the stars do you know
what they are the suns of our own space
theres orion theres cassiopeia theres
lyra theres old sol were home again

true enough dotting the blackness of
interstellar space were the old familiar con-
stellations billions of miles from earth
yet the adventurers were back in known
space and fair and clear lay their route
before them

i cant understand it al ever the scien-
tist pondered wait i have the glim-
mering of an idea you remember we were
pulled out of our course by some attraction
pulled into that other space now every-
thing in that space repelled save only the
globule of the emperor when we destroy-
ed that its attraction was gone apparent-
ly forces from either world can make them-
selves felt in the other through the point of
contact with the stronger pull of the blue
horror gone the gravitational pull of the
worlds in our own space took hold of us
and brought us back

by jove you know everything well
old croaker here we are now get us back
to old earth pronto ive got a hankering
for a nice juicy sirloin steak smothered in
onions and a great big schooner of beer
then a good exciting teletalkie play and a

an adventure in

futurity

by clark

ashton smith

illustrated by marchioni

a survivor from the lost continents
of mu or atlantis appearing on our
modern streets would have seemed no
stranger no more different from others
than the man who called himself conrad
elkins and yet i have always found it
difficult to define even in my own thoughts
the many elements which served to consti-
tute this strangeness

it would seem since we think mainly in
words and are often
for the clarification of

adjectives which would fitly describe elkina
were as yet non-existent in our vocabulary
that they could be found only in some un-
imaginably subtle complex and refined lan-
guage such as might be developed through
long cycles of elaborating culture and civ-
ilization on an older and riper planet than
ours

even at first sight i was greatly struck
-not to say startled-by the mans per-
sonality perhaps the thing which arrested
me more than all else was the impossibility
an unexpected and terrific scene revealed it-
self two men and a huge spindle-legged being
were fronting a horde of bestial creatures

of assigning him to any known ethnic stock

it is my theory that no human being is so
individual that he does not possess obvious
ear-marks which place him immediately
among the tribes of mankind and i am
prone to pride myself on a sedulously cul-
tivated gift for analyzing off-hand the an-
tionality and racial affiliations of any given
person

but elkins baffled me his extreme pal-
loi his fine hair and clear-cut lineaments
were in a general sense indicative of cau-
casian origin yet i could not find the dis-
tinguishing features of any american euro-
pean or asiatic branch of the white race
also i could not have told his age he
seemed young when one considered the
smoothness of his face and yet there was

a hint of something incalculably old in his
expression

his garb was modish and wellhailored
with nothing in the least unusual or eccen-
tric in this as in all other things he gave
always the subtle impression of desiring to
avoid notice he was a little under med-
ium height and of strangely delicate build
and his features considered by themselves
were almost effeminate apart from the great
brow of uncorrugated ivory which resem-
bled the one that we see in the portraits of
edgar allan poe

the small intricately convoluted ears the
short deeply curved lips and the queer ex-
otic moulding of the sensitive nostrils all
seemed to bespeak the possession of more
highly developed senses than are normal to

mankind his eyes were very large and
luminous of an indescribable purplish col-
or and did not flinch as i had occasion to
observe before the most intense light his
hands too were quite remarkable in their
extreme fineness flexibility and vigor they
were the hands of a super-surgeon or a su-
per-artist

the mans habitual
expression was wholly
enigmatic no one
could have read his
mind and this not
from any lack of mo-
bility or expressive-
ness in the lineaments
themselves but rather

i felt sure from the
unknown character of
his ideas and motiva-
tions about him there
was an aura of remote
recondite knowledge
of profound wisdom
and aesthetic refine-
ment assuredly he
was a mystery from all
angles and- anyone
who has gone into
chemistry as i have is
almost inevitably a
lover of mysteries i
made up my mind to
learn all that i could
concerning him

i had seen elkins a
number of times
on the streets and in
libraries and museums
before the beginning of
our actual acquaint-
ance indeed the fre-
quency of our meetings
in the multitudinous babel of new york was
so phenomenalthat i soon decided that he
must have lodgings near mine and was per-
haps engaged in similar studies i made
inquiries regarding him from librarians and
curators but learned nothing more than his
name and the fact that be had been reading
the works of havelock ellis and other mod-

ern authorities on sex as well as many books
on biology chemistry and physics

the motives which prompted his visits to
the natural history and other museums
were seemingly of a general nature but
evidently he was seeking to familiarize him-
self with certain branches of modern science
as well as archaeology being myself a
student of chemistry
who had given nearly
a decade of collegiate
and post-graduate ef-
fort to the subject and
also several years of
independent work and
experimentation in my
laboratory on wash-
ington square my cur-
iosity was touched
with fraternal interest
when i learned of el-
kins studies

others than myself
i found had been
struck by the mans
appearance but no
one really knew any-
thing about him he
was extremely taci-
turn volunteering no
information whatever
regarding himself
though impeccably po-
lite in all his dealings
with others appar-
ently he desired to
avoid making friends
or acquaintances - a
far from difficult pro-
cedure in any large
city yet oddly enough
i did not find it hard
to know him-which
as i later learned was
due to the fact that elkins had somehow
conceived an interest in me and also was
well aware of my interest

i came upon him one may afternoon as
he was standing in the natural history
museum before a case of artifacts from the
mounds of the mississippi valley to all
appearance he was deeply absorbed i had

rthe stories of clark
ashton smith ring
with truth he writes so
well and so easily that the
scenes that he tries to pic-
ture cannot help but be im-
pressed on the minds of
his readers

to write a real story of
the future needs this un-
usual faculty of writing
imaginatively the author
must describe something
that has not happened in
an age that has not yet ar-
rived to do this requires
skill of the highest sort
that our author has this
skill will be evident from
almost the first words of
the present story

the world of the future
may not be the paradise
that some people imagine

it is quite possible that for
every advance in science
there will come with it some
subtle damage to our
bodies our minds our civ-
ilization and it is quite
possible that even when
the day has come when
man thinks that he has
found a golden age he may
realize as the greeks did
that destruction is just
around the corner	
an adventure in futurity



made up my mind to address him on some
pretext or another when suddenly he fore-
stalled me

has it ever occurred to you he said in
a grave finely modulated voice how many
civilizations have been irretrievably lost
how many have been buried by deluge gla-
cial action and geological cataclysm and
also by profound social upheavals with their
subsequent reversions to savagery

and do you ever think that present-day
new york will some time be as fragmentary
and fabulous as troy or zimbabwe that
archaeologists may delve in its ruins be-
neath the sevenfold increment of later cities
and find a few rusting
mechanisms of disputed
use and potteries of
doubtful- date and in
scriptions which no one
can decipher

i assure you this is
not only probable but cer-
tain the very history of
america in some future
epoch will become more
or less legendary and it
would surprise you to
know the theories and be-
liefs regarding the current
civilization which will
some day be prevalent

you speak as if you
had some inside informa-
tion on the subject i re-
plied halfjestingly

elkins gave me a quick inscrutable
glance

i am interested in all such things he
said and by the same token mr pastor
i believe you are something of a specula-
tive thinker yourself along different lines
i have read your little thesis on the cosmic
rays your idea that these rays might be-
come a source of illimitable power through
concentration appeals to me i can safely
say that the idea is quite ultra-modern

i was surprised that he knew my name
but obviously he had made inquiries similar
to mine also of course i was pleased by
his familiarity with a treatise that was gen-
erally looked upon as being rather ad-

vanced not to say fantastic in its theories

the ice being thus broken the growth of
our acquaintance was rapid elkins came to
my rooms and laboratory many times and
i in turn was admitted to his own modest
lodgings which as i had surmised were
only a few blocks away from mine on the
same street

the man of mystery

a score of meetings and the develop-
ment of a quasi-friendship left me as
 fundamentally ignorant concerning elkins
as i had been at first i do not know why
he liked me-perhaps it
was the universal human
need of a friend inescap-
able at all times and in all
places but somehow the
half-affectionate air which
he soon adopted toward
me did not make it any
easier to ask the personal
questions that seethed
within me

the more i came to
know him the more i was
overcome by a sense of
impossible seniority on
his part-by the feeling
that he must be older and
intellectually more evolv-
ed than myself in a fash-
ion that could not be
measured by tabulated years or classified
knowledge strangely-since such a feel-
ing has been unique in my experience-i
was almost like a child before him and
grew to regard him with something of the
awe which a child conceives toward an elder
who is seemingly omniscient nor was the
awe conditioned at first by anything which he
actually said or did

the furnishings of his rooms were as non-
committal as the man himself there was
nothing to seize upon as indicating his na-
tionality and antecedents however i saw
at once that he was a linguist for there were
books in at least four modern languages
one which he told me he had just been
reading was a recent and voluminous ger-

man work on the physiology of sex

are you really much interested in that
stuff i ventured to ask there is it
seems to me overmuch discussion and all
too little knowledge regarding such mat-
ters

i agree with you he rejoined one
hears of special knowledge but it fails to
materialize on investigation i thought that
i had an object in studying this branch of
th century science but now i doubt great-
ly if there is anything of value to be learn-
ed

i was struck by the tone of intellectual
impersonality which he maintained in all our
discussions no matter what the subject his
range of information was obviously vast
and he gave the impression of boundless re-
serves though there were certain avenues
of science generally looked upon as im-
portant in our day to which he seemed to
have given only a somewhat cursory and
negligent attention

i gathered that he did not think much of
current medicine and surgery and he start-
led me more than once by pronouncements
on electricity and astronomy that were wide-
ly at variance with accepted ideas some-
how at most times he made me feel that
he was discreetly curbing the full expression
of his thoughts he spoke of einstein with
respect and seemed to regard him as the
one real thinker of the age mentioning more
than once with great approval his theories
concerning time and space

elkins showed a tactful interest in my
own chemical researches but somehow i
felt that he looked upon them as being rather
elementary once in an unguarded man-
ner he spoke of the transmutation of me-
tals as if it were already an accomplished
every day fact explaining the reference
when i questioned him as a rhetorical
flight of imagination in which he had lost
himself for the moment

the late spring and early summer passed
and the mystery which had drawn me to
elkins was still unsolved i did indeed
learn from a casual remark that he was a
native of north america-which failed to
render his ethnic distinction any the less
baffling i decided that he must represent

a reversion to some type whose lineaments
have not been preserved in history or must
be one of those rare individuals who anti-
cipate in themselves a whole era of the
future evolution of the race i will not deny
that the truth occurred to me more than
once but how was i to know that the truth
was a thing so utterly improbable

much as i had grown to admire and even
revere him elkins was to me the most in-
comprehensible and alien being on earth
and i sensed in him a thousand differences
of thought and emotion and a world of un-
familiar knowledge which for some reason
he was trying to withhold from my appre-
hension

one day toward the end of the summer
he said to me

i must leave new york before long
hugh

i was startled since hitherto he had made
no reference to leaving or to the duration
of his stay

you are returning home perhaps i
hope it will at least be possible for us to
keep in touch with each other

he gave me a long unreadable glance
yes i am going home but odd as it
may seem to you there will be no possi-
bility of future communication between us
we part for all time-unless you should
care to accompany me

my curiosity seethed anew at his cryptic
words yet somehow i was still unable to
ask the questions that arose to my lips

if you mean that as an invitation i
said i shall be glad to accept and pay you
a visit sometime

 i vtes it is an invitation he rejoined
-l gravely but before accepting
would you not prefer to know where you
are going perhaps when you hear the
truth you will not care to accept and
perhaps you will not even believe me

for once my inquisitiveness was stronger
than my respect

do you live on mars or saturn then
he smiled no i am a denizen of the
earth though it may surprise you in the
present infantile condition of astronautics
to learn that i have made more than one
an adventure in futurity



voyage to mars i realize your natural
curiosity concerning me and an explana-
tion is now necessary if when you have
learned the truth you still care to accom-
pany me as my guest i shall be overjoyed
to take you with me and to offer you my
hospitality for as long as you wish to re-
main

he paused a moment the mystery that
has troubled you will be fully explained
when i tell you that i am not a man of your
own era but have come from a period far
in the future-or what is known to you as
the future according to your notation my
proper time is about  ad my real
name is kronous alkon-i have assumed
the vaguely analogous one of conrad elkins
as well as the speech and garb of your time
for reasons which will be fairly obvious

at present i shall give you only a brief
summary of the causes which prompted my
visit to the th century it would require
a long discourse to even offer you an ade-
quate sketch of our social anatomy and
problems and i speak merely of one aspect

humanity in our age is menaced with
gradual extinction through an increasing
overpreponderance of male children and a
method of sex-control which would restore
in some degree the balance of nature is ur-
gently desired

your age the first great mechanistic
era is a well-nigh mythical period to us
and less known even than certain earlier
periods because of the all-engulfing savag-
ery to which man reverted at its end there
ensued long dark ages through which only
the most fragmentary records survived along
with a legendry of vast uncouth machines
which the superstition of peoples identified
with avenging demons perhaps they were
not without reason since the abuse of
machinery was one of the main causes of
your debacle

also there remained a widespread pop-
ular belief accepted even now by many of
our scientists that the people of the th
century could determine at will the sex of
their offspring and that the secret of this
determination was lost in the ensuing barbar-
ism along with certain minor secrets of

chemistry and metallurgy which no later
civilization has ever re-discovered

the former belief has no doubt arisen
because the sexes are well known to have
been numerically equal in your time and
because they have not been equal since for
many thousands of years after the re-
building of an enlightened civilization on
the ruins of yours girl-children predomin-
ated and the whole world became a matri-
archy

the period known as the amazonian wars
which were the most sanguinary and merci-
less wars in history put an end to the matri-
archy by wiping out all but a few hundred
thousand of the human race these reverted
to the most primitive conditions there were
more dark ages and then slowly the evolu-
tion of our present cycle of renewed cul-
ture in which the male predominates both
numerically and intellectually but our dif-
ficulties were not over

it was to recover the fabled secret of sex-
determination that i came back through the
ages and have lived among you for a full
year of th century time it has been a
fascinating experience and i have learned
many things regarding the antique world
which are altogether unknown and unverifi-
able to my fellows

- your crude cumbrous machines and
buildings are not unimpressive in their
way and your science is not without a few
inklings of our later discoveries but ob-
viously you know even less regarding the
mysterious laws of biology and sex than we
do your supposed method of determination
is truly fabulous and i have no reason for
tarrying any longer in an alien epoch

now to become personal hugh you
are the only friend i have cared to make in
the epoch your mind is in some respects
beyond the age and though everything will
seem different to you in our time and much
will be incomprehensible i am sure you
will find a surpassing interest in the world
of  ad i shall of course provide you
with a safe means of return to your own era
whenever you wish will you go with me

faction by the remarkable things that my
friend had just told me his statements
were no less than miraculous-yet somehow
they were not incredible i did not doubt
hi veracity for an instant after all it was
the only logical explanation of everything
that had puzzled me in conrad elkins

of course ill go with you i cried
overcome and dazzled by the strange oppor-
tunity which he offered me

chapter ii
the time machine

there were a hundred obvious ques-
tions that i wanted to ask elkins an-
ticipating certain of these he said

the machine in which i travelled through
time is a vessel commonly used among us
for space-travel i will explain to you later
the modification of the original mechanism
which rendered possible a journey in that
fourth-dimensional space known as time i
have reason to believe that the invention is
wholly unique and has never been dupli-
cated

i had nurtured for many years my pro-
ject for visiting your period and in prepar-
ation for this i made a prolonged study of
all available historic data bearing thereon
as well as the archaeological and literary re-
mains of antique america as i have said
the remains are fragmentary but the lan-
guage being the root-stock of our own
tongue is fairly well-known to our scholars

i took pains to master it as far as possi-
ble though i have since found that some
of our pronunciations and definitions are
erroneous also that the vocabulary is much
ampler than we had supposed

i studied likewise the costumes of your
period of which a few plates are still ex-
tant and made for myself habiliments which
would enable me to pass unnoticed upon my
arrival

elkins paused and went to his clothes-
closet he opened it and brought out a
suit of some soft brown fabric it was not
badly tailored though the cut was unfamil-
iar later i found that the actual plate
from which it had been designed belonged

to the year  ten years in advance of
our own date

elkins went on my departure was care-
fully planned and i am supposed to have
gone on a voyage to the asteroids several
of which notably pallas vesta and ceres
have been colonized by human beings for
hundreds of years past

i made the actual time-journey in a state
of unconsciousness this as you will soon
learn was inevitable because of the tempor-
ary abstraction from everything that creates
or contributes to what we know as con-
sciousness i was prepared for it and had
made all the necessary calculations and ad-
justments beforehand and had carefully
synchronized the movement of the vessel in
the time-dimension with the movement of the
earth and the solar system in space geo-
graphically speaking i would not move an
inch during the entire trip

rising to an elevation of thirty thou-
sand feet above the earth i started the time-
mechanism there was a period of absolute
oblivion a second or a million years would
have seemed the same and then with the
ceasing of the time-flight i recovered my
senses knowing that i was now in the
th century if my calculations were cor-
rect and not choosing to advertise my
strangeness i sought for a place where i
could land quietly and without detection

the place which i selected after much
circumnavigation and study was an inac-
cessible cliff in the catskill mountains far
from any settlement there i descended at
night and left my machine whose presence
was indetectible either from below or above
i finished my descent of the cliff by the use
of an anti-gravitational device and made my
way from the wilderness

the next day i was in new york where
for the most part i have remained ever
since and have carried on unobtrusively my
studies of your civilization for monetary
needs i had brought with me some disin-
terred coinsof your period and also a few
small ingots of chemically wrought gold

he showed me one of the coins-a silver
dollar that was stained almost beyond re-
cognition like an ancient obolus by the
oxidation of untold centuries then he
an adventure in futurity



brough out another garment from the
clothes-closet-a short flaring tunic of dull
red with a long graceful mantle that could
b detached at will since it was fastened to
the shoulders by two clasps of carven silver
the fabric as well as the garment itself
was strange to me kronous also brought
out a pair of sandals vaguely resembling
those of the ancients though they were not
made of leather but of some stiff inde-
structible cloth

this he said is the raiment in which
i left akameria the america of  ad
i will have a similar tunic made for you by
some costume-tailor here in new york-and
also sandals though i suppose the sandals
will have to be of leather since the material
used in these is a chemical product of my
own time i am planning to leave day after
tomorrow and i hope that will not be too
soon for you

indeed it wont i replied i havent
many preparations to make-theres nothing
to do but lock up the laboratory and phone
a few friends that i am leaving for a world-
tour of indefinite length i dont imagine
therell be any search-parties

two days later with an hour of day-
light still before us elkins and i had
reached the base of the unsurmountable cliff
on which the time-machine was hidden the
last four hours of our journey had been on
fcot we were in the wildest section of the
castkills and staring up at the terrible
mountain-wall i felt an increased awe of my
strange companion who seemed to have no
doubt whatever of his ability to scale it

he opened a small satchel whose con-
tents he had not hitherto revealed to me and
took out the anti-gravitational device of
which he had spoken the thing was a hol-
low disk of some dull unidentifiable metal
with chains of an equally ambiguous mater-
ial which secured it to the body elkins
showed me the simple operation of the
mechanism which he said was electronic in
it nature then he strapped it to his chest
set the apparatus running and rose slowly
in air till he reached the top of the pre-
cipice there he disappeared from view
but a few moments later the metal disk was

lowered at the end of a long cord for my
use in surmounting the cliff

following directions i proceeded to ad-
just the mechanism and start it going the
feeling of utter weightlessness as i floated
upward was a most unique experience it
was as if i were a feather wafted on an im-
perceptible air-current being unused to
the apparatus i did not understand the finer
technique of movement beneath its influ-
ence and when i came to the cliff-edge i
would have continued to drift skyward if
my companion had not reached out and
stopped me

i found myself standing beside him on a
broad ledge overhung by another cliff which
rose immediately above it certainly elkins
could not have chosen a safer hiding-place
for his time-machine

the vessel itself whose door elkins now
proceeded to unlock was a long spindle-
shaped affair evidently designed for swift
movement in air or ether it could not have
carried more than three people inside it
was lined with lockers and machinery and 
there were great slings or cradles in which
the driver and passengers were immovably
suspended this of course was requisite
during the loss of gravity and normal weight
in ether-flight elkins said that he had
found it equally convenient to strap himself
into one of the slings during his voyage in
time

both of us were still dressed in th cen-
tury attire elkins now donned the tunic
and sandals of his own age which he had
brought along in the satchel together with
the duplicates that had been made for me
by a somewhat mystified costumer these
elkin directed me to put on i obeyed
feeling like a masquerader in the odd garb

that is the last of conrad elkins said
my companion pointing to his discarded
suit henceforth you must call me kron-
our alkon your name will seem pretty
outlandish among us so i think i will in-
troduce you as huno paskon a young colon-
ial born on pallas

kronous alkon now busied himself with
the machinery of the vessel this to my
untrained eye was awesomely intricate he
adjusted a series of movable rods that were


wonder stories

set in a notched board and seemed to be
winding up a clock-like apparatus with a
numbered dial and three hands there were
hundreds-perhaps thousands-of figures
on the dial

that he said is to control within pre-
cise limits the extent of our forward move-
ment in the time-dimension we are all set
for the proper year month and day

he now fastened me and then himself
in the complicated slings and turned to a
small key-board with many knobs and levers
which seemed to be distinct from the rest
of the machinery

these he said are the controls for
atmosphere and ether-flight before turn-
ing oil the time-power i shall rise to a
higher altitude and fly south for about fifty
miles

he turned one of the knobs there was
a low drumming sound but i would not
have been conscious of any movement if a
sudden sunset-glow through the vessels
ports had not shown that we were rising
above the level of the cliffs

after a few minutes kronous alkon mov-
ed one of the levers and the drumming
ceased the power of space-flight he
said is provided by atomic disintegration
now for the time-flight i shall make use of
a very different kind of power-a strange
complex energy derived from the repercus-
sion of cosmic rays which will transport
us into what for lack of a better name is
called the fourth dimension

properly speaking we will be outside of
space and from a mundane view-point will
iv non-existent i assure you however that
there is no danger when the time-power
shuts off automatically in  ad you
and i will awaken as if from a deep sleep
the sensation of dropping off may prove
rather terrific but no more so than the tak-
ing of certain anaesthetics simply let your-
self go and realize that there is nothing to
fear

mutiny

he seized a large rod and gave it a
powerful jerk i felt as if i had re-
ceived an electric shock that was tearing all

my tissues apart and disintegrating me into
my ultimate cells and molecules in spite
of the re-assurance of kronous alkon i was
overwhelmed by an unspeakably confusing
terror i had the sensation of being divided
into a million selves all of which were
whirling madly downward in the maelstrom
of a darkening gulf they seemed to go
out one by one like sparks as they reached
a certain level till soon all were gone and
there was nothing anywhere but darkness
and unconsciousness 

i came to myself in a manner which was
like the direct reversal of my descent into
oblivion first there was that sense of re-
mote and spark-like entities which increased
to a multitude all of them drifting upward
in cosmic gloom from an ultimate nadir
and then the gradual merging of these enti-
ties into one as the interior of the time-
machine resumed coherent outline around
me then i saw before me the figure of
kronous alkon who had twisted about in
his sling and was smiling as he met my
gaze it seemed to me that i had slept for
a long long time

my companion pressed a knob and i had
the feeling of one who descends in an ele-
vator it was not necessary for kronous
alkon to tell me that we were sinking earth-
ward in less than a minute trees and
buildings were visible through the ports
and there was a slight jar as we landed

now said kronous we are on my coun-
try estate near djarma the present capital
of akameria djarma is built on the ruins
of the city of new york but is hundreds of
miles inland since there have been exten-

he had unstrapped himself and was per-
forming the same service for me then he
opened the door of the vessel and motioned
me to precede him i was met by wafts of
warm perfume-laden air as i stepped out
on a stone platform adjoining a sort of aero-
drome-a great shining edifice in which
an adventure in futurity



were housed various air-craft of unfamiliar
types

not far away was another building mark-
ed by a light graceful architecture with
many tiers of open galleries and high fan-
tastic eiffel-like towers there were ex-
tensive gardens around this building and
broad fields of vegetables that i did not
recognize ran away on each side of the dis-
tance somewhat apart there stood a group
of long one-storied houses

my home said kronous i trust that
everything is well i left the estate in
charge of my two cousins altus and oron
also there is trogh the martian overseer
and a barracoon of venusian slaves who do
all the agricultural labor all our neces-
sary menial and industrial tasks are per-
formed by such slaves who have been im-
ported to earth for many generations and
are now becoming a problem in themselves
i hope there has not been any trouble dur-
ing my absence

i noticed that kronous had taken from an
inner pocket of his tunic a small rod
vaguely resembling a flash-light and having
a ball of red glass or crystal at one end
this he was now carrying in his hand

an electronic projector he explained
the current paralyzes but does not kill at
any distance up to fifty yards sometimes
we have to use such weapons when the slaves
are recalcitrant the venusians are a low
vicious type and require careful handling

we started toward the house whose lower
stories were half-concealed by tall trees and
massed shrubbery no sign of life was
manifest as we followed a winding path
among fountains of colored marble and
palms and rhododendrons and baroque un-
earthly-looking plants and flowers that
would have baffled a present-day botanist
kronous told me that some of these latter
were importations from venus the hot
humid air was saturated with odors which
i found oppressive but which kronous ap-
peared to inhale with delight

rounding a sharp turn in the path we
came to an open lawn immediately in front
ol the house here an unexpected and ter-
rific scene revealed itself two men at-
tived like kronous and a huge barrel-

chested spindle-legged being with an ugly
head like that of a hydrocephalous frog
were fronting a horde of bestial creatures
who would have made the neanderthal man
look like an example of classic beauty in
comparison

there must have been a score of these be-
ings many of whom were armed with clubs
and stones which they were hurling at the
three who opposed them their brown-
black bodies were clothed only with patches
and tufts of coarse purple hair and per-
haps half of their number were adorned
with thick bifurcated tails these i learn-
ed later were the females-the males for
some obscure evolutionary reason being un-
distinguished in this respect

ftl he slaves cried kronous as he
jl ran forward with his projector level-
led following him i saw the fall of one
of the two men beneath the impact of a large
stone a dozen of the slaves were lying
senseless on the lawn and i could see that
the persons they were attacking were armed
with projectors

our approach had not been noticed and
kronous made deadly use of his weapon at
close range stretching slave after slave on
the ground turning and apparently recog-
nizing their master the remainder began to
disperse sullenly their rout was com-
pleted by the heavy-chested giant who hurl-
ed after them with his catapult-like arms
much of the ammunition which they had
dropped on beholding kronous

i fear that altus is badly hurt said
kronous as we joined the little group on
the lawn the other man whom kronous
now introduced to me as his cousin oron
was stooping over the fallen figure and ex-
amining a hidden wound from which blood
was streaming heavily amid the fine black
hair oron who acknowledged the intro-
duction with a courteous nod had himself
been cut and bruised by several missiles

the introduction had been made in eng-
lish kronous and oron now began to talk
ir a language that i could not understand
apparently some explanation was being
made regarding myself for oron gave me a
quick curious glance the giant had ceased


wonder stories

hurling stones and clubs after the departing
venusians and now came to join us

that is trogh the martian overseer
said kronous to me like all of his race he
is extremely intelligent they are an old
people with the immemorial civilization that
has followed a different trend from ours but
is not therefore necessarily inferior and we
of earth have learned much from them
though they are highly reserved and secre-
tive

the reddish-yellow body of the martian
was attired only in a black loin-cloth his
squat toad-like features under the high
bulging knobby head were impossible to
read and i was chilled by the sense of an
unbridgeable evolutionary gulf as i looked
into his icy green eyes

culture wisdom power were manifest
behind his gaze but in forms that no human
being was properly fitted to understand he
spoke in a harsh guttural voice evidently
using human language though the words
were difficult to recognize as being in any
way related to those employed by kronous
and oron because of an odd prolongation
of the vowels and consonants

carrying among us the still unconscious
form of altus oron kronous trogh and
myself entered the portico of the nearby
house both the architecture and material
of this building were the most beautiful i
had ever seen much use was made of
arabesque arches and light decorative pil-
lars the material which resembled a very
translucent onyx was as kronous told me
in reality a synthetic substance prepared by
atomic transmutation

within there were many couches covered
with unknown opulent fabrics of superb de-
sign the rooms were large with lofty
vaulted ceilings and in many cases were di-
vided only by rows of pillars or by tapes-
tries the furniture was of much beauty
with light curving lines that conformed to
the architecture and some of it was made
from gem-like materials and gorgeous met-
als that i could not name there were scores
of paintings and statues mainly of the most
bizarre and fantastic nature and testifying to
supreme technical skill i learned that some
of the paintings were first-hand depictions

of scenes on alien planets

we laid altus ona couch the man was
indeed severely injured and his breathing
was slow and faint in all likelihood he had
suffered some degree of brain-concussion

kronous brought out a bulb-shaped mech-
anism ending in a hollow cone which he ex-
plained to me was the generator of a force
known as osc-a super-electric energy used
in the treatment of wounds as well as of ill-
ness in general it was of sovereign power
in restoring the normal processes of health
no matter what the cause of derangement
might be

when the generator was set in action by
kronous i saw the emission of a green light
from the hollow end falling on the head of
the wounded man the pulse of altus be-
came stronger and he stirred a little but did
not awaken as yet when kronous turned
off the green ray after a few minutes he
asked me to examine the wound and i
found that it was already beginning to heal

altus will be perfectly well in two or
three days said kronous

the real problem he went on is the
venusians-and not only for me but for
everyone else it was a dreadful mistake
to bring them to earth in the beginning
they are not only ferocious and intractable
but they breed with the most appalling fe-
cundity in opposition to the dwindling
numbers of the human race already they
outnumber us five to one and in spite of
our superior knowledge and weapons i be-
lieve that they constitute our worst menace
all that they require is a little organization

chapter iii
the world of  a d

evening had now fallen trogh had
retired to his own quarters presided
over by his martian wife at some distance
from the house a meal consisting mainly
of delicious fruits and vegetables most of
which were new to me was served by oron

i learned that one of the vegetables was a
species of truffle imported from venus af
tei we had eaten a strong delicately flav-
ored liqueur made from a fruit that vaguely
an adventure in futurity



resembled both the peach and the pineapple
was brought out in deep slender glasses of
crystal

kronous now spoke at some length he
told me that he had already confided the
truth concerning his time-voyage and myself
to oron the reason i did not want my
trip to be known he said is because of
the mechanical principle involved which
might be stolen or duplicated by some other
inventor and i am dubious of its value to
mankind in general

we of the present era have learned not
to abuse mechanical devices in the gross
manner of earlier generations but even so
it is not well that man should know too
much we have conquered space and the
conquest has entailed new perils on the
whole i think it would be better if the con-
quest of time should remain an isolated ex-
ploit i can trust oron and also altus to
keep the secret

he went on to speak of various things
which he felt that it was necessary for me
to know you will find he soliloquized
that our world is motivated by desires and
ambitions very different from those which
are most prevalent in your own the mere
struggle for existence for wealth and power
is almost alien to our comprehension crime
is extremely rare among us and we have
few problems of administration or govern-
ment when such occur they are submit-
ted to the arbitration of a board of scien-
tists

we have infinite leisure and our aspira-
tions are toward the conquest of remote
knowledge the creation of rare art-forms
and the enjoyment of varied intellectual and
esthetic sensations aided by the long life-
span averaging three or four hundred years
which our mastery of disease has made pos-
sible i myself am  years old as it
may surprise you to learn

i am not sure however that this mode
of life has been wholly to our advantage
perhaps through the very lack of struggle 
of hardship of difficulty we are becoming
effete and effeminate but i think we will
be put to a severe test before long

coming as you have from a commercial
age he went on it will no doubt interest

you to be told that half of our own com-
merce is interplanetary there are whole
fleets of ether-craft that ply between the
earth mars venus the moon and the aster-
oids however we are not on the whole a
commercial people apart from those of us
who have chosen to live in cities the re-
mainder are mostly the owners of large
plantations where everything necessary is
produced or manufactured by slave-labor
it is of course only our dwindling numbers
that have made this system possible

we possess the power if we so desire
of manufacturing everything through a mode
of chemical synthesis however we find
that natural food-stuffs are preferable to the
synthetic kind and we make less use of our
knowledge in this regard than you might
suppose perhaps the chief use of our mas-
tery of atomic conversion is in the making
of fabrics and building-materials

there is much more that i might tell
you but you will see and learn for yourself
tomorrow morning oron and myself will
begin to instruct you in our language

thus began several quiet weeks of life
on kronous estate i made rapid pro-
gress in the language which bore about the
same relation to english that english bears
to latin i was given access to a fine and
extensive library filled with the latest
scientific works with fiction and poetry of
the latter-day world and also a few rare
items dating from periods which though
long subsequent to our own time were
nevertheless buried in the dust of antiquity
on several occasions kronous took me
through his laboratory in which he could
perform the most incredible marvels of
atomic transformation and feats of micros-
copic analysis that revealed a whole world
in the electron i realized that the science
of our time was childs-play compared with
that of the era into which i had been trans-
ported

one day kronous showed me a cabinet
full of objects that had been recovered from
the ruins of new york and other antique ci-
ties among them were porcelain dinner-
plates masonic emblems pearl necklaces
china door-knobs twenty dollar gold-pieces


wonder stories

and spark-plugs the sight of them and the
realization of their extreme age combined
with their homely familiarity aroused in me
the most violent nostalgia-an intolerably
desperate homesickness for my-own period
this feeling lasted for days and kronous
did not show me any more ancient relics

altus had recovered fully from his wound
and i heard of no more insubordination
from the slaves of kronous however i
could not forget the terrible scene which
had formed my initiation into life on the
estate i saw many times the savage-look-
ing venusians who went about their agri-
cultural labors with a sullen air of mindless
brooding and i was told much concerning
them

their ancestors were inhabitants of the
deep and noisomely luxuriant jungles of
venus where they lived under the most
primitive conditions in perpetual conflict
with terrible animals and insects and also
with each other they were cannibalistic
by nature and their habits in this respect
had proven hard to curb every now and
then on the plantations one of their number
would disappear surreptitiously

the slave-trade had flourished for several
centuries but had languished of late years
since those brought to earth had now multi-
plied in excess of the required quota the
original venusian slaves were mostly though
not all the captives of tribal raids and
wars and they had been purchased very
cheaply by terrestrial traders in exchange
for alcoholic liquors and edged weapons

however the venusians had been willing
to sell even members of their own tribes
apparently there was little attachment or
loyalty among them and their instincts
were those of wolves and tigers

the martians had come to earth mainly
as traders though their services were some-
times procurable for such positions as the
one held by trogh they were taciturn and
aloof but they had permitted certain of
their chemical and astronomical discoveries
to be utilized by human beings

they were a philosophical race much
given to dreaming and were universally
addicted to the use of a strange drug known
as fmdtan the juice of a martian weed

this drug was more powerful than opium
or hashish and gave rise to even wilder vis-
ions but its effects were physically harm-
less its use had spread among human be-
ings till a law was passed forbidding its
importation it was still smuggled both by
martians and terrestrials in spite of all the
efforts made to stop it and addiction to the
drug was still fairly common among human-
ity

by means of radio and television both of
which were now employed in vastly simpli-
fied and improved forms kronous and his
cousins were in hourly touch with the whole
world of their time and even with the earth-
stations on mars venus the moon and the
larger asteroids i was privileged to see in
their televisors many scenes that would have
appeared like the maddest visions of delir-
ium back in 

the black rot

we were posted on all the news of the
world and with my growing mastery
of the language i soon came to the point
where i no longer required the interpreta-
tion of kronous to understand the announce-
ments much of this news was not reassur-
ing but served to confirm the prophetic
fears that had been voiced by my host

there were daily outbreaks on the part of
venusian slaves all over the planet and in
many cases much damage was inflicted be-
fore they could be subdued also these
outbreaks were beginning to display a mys-
terious concertion and a degree of mentality
of which the venusians had not hitherto
been believed capable

acts of sabotage as well as personal as-
saults were increasingly common and the
sabotage in particular often showed a ra-
tional intelligence even at this early date
there were those who suspected that the ven-
usians were being aided and incited by the
martians but there was no tangible proof
of such abetting at the time

one day from djarma there came the
news of that bizarre mineral plague known
as the black rot one by one the buildings
in the suburbs of djarma were being at-
tacked by this novel disease which caused
an adventure in futurity



their synthetic stone and metal to dissolve
inch by inch in a fine black powder the
rot was the work of a micro-organism which
must somehow have been introduced from
venus where its ravages had been noted in
certain mountain-ranges its appearance on
earth was a mystery but had all the air of
another act of sabotage it was capable of
devouring half the elements known to chem-
istry and off-hand nothing could be dis-
covered to arrest its progress though all the
akamerian chemists were at work on the
problem

kronous and i watched in the televisor
the working of the black rot somehow it
was inexpressibly terrifying to see the slowly
spreading area of silent and utter devasta-
tion the crumbled or half-eaten buildings
from which the occupants had fled the
thing had started on the outskirts of djarma
and was steadily devouring the city in an
ever-broadening arc

all the best-known scientists of akameria
were summoned in conclave at djarma to
study the rot and devise if possible a means
of retardation kronous who was a re-
nowned chemist and microscopist was
among those called upon he offered to
take me with him and of course i accepted
with the utmost eagerness

the trip was a matter of no more than
fcrty miles and we made it in a light air-
vessel belonging to kronous-a sort of
monoplane run by atomic power 

though i had already familiarized myself
with many of the scenes of djarma by tele-
vision the city was a source of absorbing
fascination to me it was far smaller than
new york and was widely spaced with many
gardens and exuberant semi-tropical parks
meandering through its whole extent the
architecture was nearly all of the same open
aerial type that i had seen in kronous
home the streets were broad and spacious
and there were comparatively few large
buildings the whole effect was one of
supreme grace and beauty

the streets were not overcrowded with
people and no one ever seemed to be in a
hurry it was strange to see the grotesque
martians and bestial venusians mingling
everywhere with humans of the same type

as kronous the stature and build of kron-
ous were about the average and it was rare
to see a man who was taller than five feet
six inches i of course with my five feet
eleven was very conspicuous and attracted
much attention

the conclave of savants was being held
in a large edifice built expressly for such
meetings at the heart of djarma enter-
ing we found that about two hundred men
some of whom were extremely old and vener-
able had already gathered in the council
chamber much general discussion was go-
ing on and those who had ideas to suggest
were listened to in respectful silence kron-
ous and i took seats amid the gathering so
intent were all these men on the problem to
be solved that few of them even vouchsafed
me a curious glance

peering at the faces about me i was awed
by an impression of supreme intellectuality
and wisdom-the garnered lore of incalcul-
able ages also on many of these coun-
tenances i perceived the marks of a world-
old ennui and the stamp of a vague sterility
an incipient decadence

for some time kronous and i listened to
the discussion that was in progress pon-
dering the various data brought forward i
was struck by the fact that all the elements
assailed by the black rot belonged at the
opposite end of the scale from radium in
regard to their atomic activity and explo-
siveness

c otto voce i commented on this to
 kronous is it not possible i sug-
gested that radium might be of some use in
combating the plague i believe you have
told me that radium like any other element
is easily manufacturable nowadays

that is a striking inspiration said
kronous thoughtfully and it might be
worth  trying with our chemical mastery
we can make all the radium we need at will
in our laboratories with your permission
i am going to broach the idea

he arose and spoke briefly amid the at-
tentive silence of the assembly credit for
the idea he announced as he ended must
be given to huno paskon a young colonial


wonder stories

from pallas whom i have brought to earth
as my guest

i felt myself abashed by the grave unan-
imous gaze of these erudite and reverend
savants who all eyed me in a manner that
i could not fathom somehow it seemed
unthinkably presumptuous to have made any
suggestion in their presence

however there appeared to be much ser-
ious debate going on-a widespread discus-
sion in which the proposed use of radium
was manifestly meeting with great favor
at last a venerable savant named argo kan
who was spokesman of the assembly rose
and said

i vote for an immediate trial of the meth-
od suggested by kronous alkon and huno
paskon

others one by one stood up and cast
similar verbal votes till the motion had been
approved by nearly everyone present

the meeting then dispersed and i learned
from kronous that work was being immed-
iately begun in local laboratories for the
preparation of radium on a large scale and
it utilization in the most effective form

in less than an hour several chemists
were ready to visit the area of destruction
with portable machines in which radium was
disintegrated and used as a fine spray it
was magical in arresting the black rot
which had been eating its way continuously
into the city creeping from house to house
along the crumbling pavements the whole
affected area which now covered several
square miles was soon surrounded by a cor-
don of men equipped with the radium-mach-
ines and to the vast relief of the people of
djarma and akameria the plague was pro-
nounced under control

chapter iv
captured by cannibals

durng our stay in djarama kronous
and i were guests in a fine building set
apart for the use of visiting scientists i
was amazed at the sybaritic luxury develop-
ed by this people-a luxury which though
illiznitably and unimaginably resourceful

was at no time in excess of the bounds of
good taste

there were baths that would have been
the envy of a roman emperor and beds that
would have reduced cleopatra to beggary
we were lulled by rich aerial music from
no visible source and were served with food
and with all other necessities as if by in-
tangible hands at the mere verbal expres-
sion of a wish

of course there was a mechanical secret
to such wonders but the secret was cleverly
hidden and the means never obtruded itself
humbly i realized how far ahead of our-
selves were these men of  ad with
their quiet and consummate mastery of na-
tural laws-a mastery which none of them
seemed to regard as being of any great value
or importance

i was somewhat embarrassed by the honor
paid to myself as the originator of a means
of retarding the black rot and could only
feel that my inspiration had been merely a
fortunate accident compliments both writ-
ten and verbal were showered upon me by
scientific dignitaries and it was only
through the intercession of kronous who
explained my aversion to publicity that i
was able to avoidi numerous invitations

finding that he had certain business to
transact kronous was not ready to return to
his estate for several days since he could
not devote all of his time to me i formed
the habit of going for long walks on the
streets of djarma and through its environs

walking slowly amid the changing scenes
of a metropolis has always been a source of
unending fascination to me and of course
in this unfamiliar city of the future where
all was new and different the lure of such
wanderings was more than doubled and
the sensation of knowing that i trod above
the rgins of new york separated from my
own period by  years with their in-
conceivable historic and telluric vicissi-
tudes was about the weirdest feeling that i
have ever experienced

it was a strange spectacle through which
i sauntered vehicles were used of a light
noiseless gliding type without visible means
of propulsion and thee were many air-
vessels which flew deftly and silently over-
an adventure in futurity



head and discharged their passengers on the
roofs or balconies of the high buildings
and the landing or departure of great shin-
ing ether-ships was an hourly occurrence
however it was the throng of foot-passen-
gers which engaged ray attention most

 both sexes and all ages were attired in
gaily colored costumes i was impressed
by the practical absence of noise tumult and
hurry all was orderly tranquil uncon-
fused from the scarcity of women in the
crowd i realized how true were the racial
fears expressed by kronous the women
whom i saw were seldom beautiful or at-
tractive according to th century stand-
ards in fact there was something almost
lifeless and mechanical about them almost
sexless

it was as if the sex had long reached
the limit of its evolutionary development
and was now in a state of stagnation 
virtual retrogression such i learned from
kronous was indeed the case but these
women because of their rarity and their
value to the race were shielded gnd pro-
tected with great care polyandry was pre-
valent and romantic love or even strong
passion were unknown things in this latter-
day world

a horrible homesickness came over me at
times as i roamed amid this alien throng and
peered into shop-windows where outlandish
food-stuffs and curiously wrought fabrics
from foreign planets were often displayed
and the feeling would increase whenever i
approached the martian quarter where
dwelt a considerable colony of these my-
sterious outsiders

some of them had transported their own
many-angled and asymmetrical architecture
to earth their houses defied the rules of
geometry-one might almost say those of
gravity and the streets about them were
full of exotic odors among which the stupe-
fying reek of the drug gnultan was predom-
inant the place allured me even though
it disturbed me and i strolled often through
the tortuous alleys beyond which i would
reach the open country and wander among
luxuriant fields and palmy woods that were

the condition of having more thaa one husband

no less baffling and unfamiliar than the
scenes of the city

one afternoon i started out later than
usual as i passed through the city i
noticed that there were few venusians in
the throng and overheard rumors of fresh
revolts however i paid little attention to
these at the time

twilight had overtaken me when i turned
back from the open country toward the mar-
tian quarter the sylvan wilderness in
which i had never met many people was
quieter even than usual i was following a
narrow path bordered with thick shrubbery
and palmettoes and i began to hurry with
a vague apprehensiveness remembering the
rumors i had heard heretofore i had been
unafraid but now in the thickening twi-
light i was aware of some indefinable men-
ace and remembered that i had foolishly
forgotten to arm myself with the electronic
projector which kronous had given me to
carry in my wanderings

i had not seen anyone in the neighbor-
hood but now as i went along i scrutin-
ized the deepening shadows of the shrub-
bery on each side of the path suddenly i
heard a sound behind me that was like the
scuffling of heavy naked feet and turning
saw that seven or eight venusians several
of them armed with clubs were closing in
upon me they must have been crouching
amid the leafage as i passed

their eyes gleamed like those of ravenous
wolves in the twilight and they uttered low
snarling animal noises as they hurled them-
selves upon me i avoided the viciously
swinging weapon of the foremost and laid
him out with a neat upper-cut but the others
were at me in a moment using indiscrimin-
ately their clubs and dirty talons i was
aware of claws that tore my clothing and
slashed my flesh and then something de-
scended upon my head with a dull crash and
i went down through reeling flame and
whirling darkness to utter insensibility

when i came to myself i was conscious at
first only of my pain-racked head and limbs
the crown of my head was throbbing vio-
lently from the blow i had received then
i heard a mutter of thick unhuman voices


wonder stories

and opening my eyes beheld the flame-lit
faces and bodies of a score of venusians who
were dancing about a great fire i was ly-
ing on my back and it required only a
tentative effort at movement to tell me that
my hands and feet were bound another
man similarly bound and perhaps dead or
dying was stretched on the ground beside
me

i lay still deeming it inadvisable to let
the venusians know that i had recovered
consciousness and watched the lurid scene
it was something out of dantes inferno
with the red reflection that ran bloodily on
the uncouth hairy limbs and hideous de-
moniacal features of the interplanetary
slaves their movements though they had
a semblance of some rude horrible rhythm
were nearer to the capering of animals than
they were to the dancing of even the lowest
terrestrial savages and i could not help but
wonder that such beings had mastered the
art of lighting a fire

the use of fire i was told had been un-
known to them in their own world till the
advent of men i remembered hearing also
that they sometimes employed it nowadays
in their cannibalistic revels having acquired
a taste for cooked meat likewise it was
rumored of late that they were not averse
to human flesh and that more than one un-
fortunate had fallen a victim to their prac-
tices

such reflections were not conducive to
my peace of mind also i was oddly dis-
turbed by a large sheet of metal grating
lying near the fire and having a grotesque
resemblance to a giant gridiron which was
visible at intervals between the whirling fig-
ures at second glance i recognized it as
a sort of perforated tray which was used in
the dehydration of various fruits it was
about eight feet in length by four in width

suddenly i heard a whisper from the man
beside me whom i had supposed uncon-
scious

they are waiting for the fire to die
down he said almost inaudibly then
they will broil us alive over the coals on
that sheet of metal

ready to be eaten

i	shuddered though the information
was far from novel or unexpected

how did they get you i inquired in a
tone as low as that of my interlocutor

i am or was the owner of these slaves
he answered they caught me unaware this
time but i believe or hope that my family
has escaped i made the mistake of think-
ing the slaves were thoroughly cowed from
punishments that i inflicted not long ago i
gather that there has been a concerted revolt
this afternoon from what the savages them-
selves whose speech i understand have let
drop they are not so unintelligent as most
people believe them to be and i have a
theory that the terrestrial climate has served
to stimulate their mentality

they possess secret means of commun-
ication among themselves over the most un-
believable distances that are no less effi-
cient than radio i have long suspected too
that they have a tacit understanding with the
martians who are covertly abetting them
the micro-organism that caused the black
rot was no doubt smuggled from venus by
the martians in their ether-vessels and
there is no telling what sort of plague they
will loose next there are some queer and
frightful things on those alien planets -
things that are deadly to terrestrials though
harmless enough to the natives i fear that
the end of human supremacy is near at
hand

we conversed in this fashion for some
time and i learned that the name of my
fellow-captive was jos talar in spite of
our dire and seemingly hopeless predica-
ment he showed no evidence of fear and
the abstract philosophical manner in which
he viewed and discussed the situation was
truly remarkable but this as i had occa-
sion to observe was characteristic of the
temper of mankind in that era

a full half hour must have passed as we
lay there bound and helpless then we saw
that the huge fire was beginning to die down
revealing a vast bed of glowing coals the
light grew dimmer on the antic figures
around it and the beast-like faces of the

venusians were more loathsome than ever
id the lowering gloom

the dancing ceased as if at an unspoken
signal and several of the dancers left the
circle and came to where jos talar and
myself were lying we could see the gloat-
ing of their obscene eyes and the slavering
of thdir greedy mouths as they dug their
filthy talons into our flesh and dragged us
roughly toward the fire

in the meanwhile others had stretched the
huge metal tray upon the bed of coals all
of them were eyeing us with a hyena-like
avidity that made me shiver with sickness
and repulsion

i will not pretend that i was able to regard
with any degree of complacency the pros-
pect of becoming in the near future a venus-
ian piece de resistance but i nerved myself
to the inevitable reflecting that the agony
would soon be over even if they did not
knock us on the head beforehand there
would be a swift though terrible death on
the bed of coals

our captors had now seized us by out
feet and shoulders as if they were about to
fling us upon the improvised gridiron
there was an awful moment of suspense
and i wondered why the venusians did not
complete the expected action then i heard
from their lips a low snarling with an un-
mistakable note of alarm and saw that all
of them were watching the starlit heavens
they must have possessed keener senses than
those of humanity for at first i could neither
see nor hear anything to justify their atten-
tion then far-off among the stars i per-
ceived a moving light such as was carried
by the akamerian air-vessels

at first i did not connect the light with
any idea of possible rescue and i wondered
at the perturbation of the slaves then i
realized that the light was flying very low
and was descending straight toward the fire

il	drew near with meteoric rapidity till jos
talar and myself and the cowering savages
were illumined by the full beams of the
bluish searchlight the vessel itself like
all of its kind was almost noiseless and it
slid to earth and landed with preternatural
speed and dexterity within twenty paces of
the fire

several men emerged from its dim
bulk and ran toward us the slaves

had loosened their hold on jos talar and
myself and growling ferociously they
crouched as if ready to leap upon the ad-
vancing figures

the men were all armed with tubular ob-
jects which i supposed were the usual eleo-
tronic projectors they levelled them at
the venusians and thin rays of flame like
those from acetylene torches issued from
them and stabbed across the gloom several
of the savages screamed with agony and fell
writhing to the ground

one of them dropped among the coals and
howled for a few instants like a demon who
has been taken in some pitfall prepared for
the damned the others began to run but
were followed by long slender beams that
searched them out in their flight dropping
several more soon the survivors had dis-
appeared from view in the darkness and the
fallen had ceased to writhe

as our rescuers approached and the glow
of the dying fire illumed their faces i saw
that the foremost was kronous alkon some
of the others i recognized as scientists whom
i had met in djarma

kronous alkon knelt beside me and sever-
ed my bonds with a sharp knife while some
one else performed a like service for jos
talar

are you hurt asked kronous

not severely i replied but you cer-
tainly came just in the proverbial nick of
time a moment more and they would have
thrown us upon the fire your coming is a
miracle-i cannot imagine how it happen-
ed

that is easily explained said kronous
as he helped me to my feet when you did
not return this evening i became alarmed
and knowing the usual direction of your
wanderings i studied this part of the en-
virons of djarma very closely with a noc-
turnal televisor which renders plainly visi-
ble the details of the darkest landscape

i soon located the venusians and their
fire and recognized one of the bound figures
as being yourself after that it required
only a few minutes for me to collect several
companions arm them charter an air-vessel


wonder stories

and seek the spot indicated by the televisor
i am more than thankful that we arrived in
time

there has been he went on a world-
wide revolt of the slaves during the past few
hours two of the continents asia and aus-
tralia are already in their hands and a des-
perate struggle is going on throughout
akameria we are no longer using the
electronic projectors which merely stun
the weapons we used tonight are heat-ray
generators which kill but come-we must
return to djarma i will tell you more af-
terwards

chapter v
the struggle for the world

our flight to djarma was uneventful
and kronous and i were landed by our
companions on the roof of the building in
which we had been housed here we said
good-by to jos talar who went on with the
rescuing scientists to find certain relatives
and to learn if possible the fate of his fam-
ily

kronous and i descended to our rooms
where we found altus who had just arrived
from the estate he told us that oron had
been killed in a terrific combat with the
slaves that afternoon trogh had mysteri-
ously disappeared and altus himself had
been compelled to flee in one of the air-

	vessels belonging to kronous a truly hor-
rible state of affairs

my bruised head and lacerated body re-
quired attention and kronous gave me an
application of the green ray which marvel-
lously relieved all my pain and soreness
altus miraculously had escaped injury this
time in his hand-to-hand fighting with the
slaves

we sat for hours while kronous told us
the events of the day and while fresh reports
continued to arrive the world-situation
had indeed become serious and apart from
the universal revolt of the slaves many
new and unlooked-for perils had disclosed
themselves

in the actual conflict the venusians had
suffered more heavily than the terrestrials

and thousands of them had been slain and
others compelled to flee before the superior
weapons of mankind but to counterbalance
this a number of new and baffling plagues
had been loosed by the savages who it was
now universally felt were being assisted
i this regard by the martians in the west-
ern part of akameria great clouds of a
vicious and deadly martian insect had ap-
peared-an insect which multiplied with the
most damnable rapidity

in other sections gases had been freed in
the air that were harmless to both venus-
ians and martians but deleterious to human
beings vegetable moulds from venus
which fed like malignant parasites on all
terrene plant-forms had also been intro-
duced in a hundred places and no one knew
what else the morrow would reveal in the
way of extra-planetary pests and dangers

i	thought of the prophecy of jos talar

at this rate said kronous the world
will soon be rendered uninhabitable for
man with our heat-rays and other weapons
we might wipe out the revolutionists in
time but the plagues they have brought in
are a different problem

there was little sleep for any of us that
night we rose at early dawn to learn the
appalling news that the whole of europe
was now subject to the interplanetary slaves
the bacteria of a score of awful martian
and venusian diseases to which the out-
siders had developed more or less immun-
ity were decimating the human population
and those who survived were unable to cope
with their conquerors similar diseases
were appearing in akameria and all the
other plagues were spreading with malign
celerity

we must go to my estate immediately
and retrieve the time machine which i left in
the aerodrome said kronous to me you
can then return to your own age-it is not
fair to ask you to stay longer in a world
that is nearing ultimate ruin and chaos
we the last remnants of mankind will fight
it out as best we can but the war is not
yours

i	protested that i had no desire to leave
him that i would remain to the end and
also that i had implicit faith in the power
an adventure in futurity



of humanity to overcome its extra-terrestrial
foes

kronous smiled a little sadly never-
theless he persisted we must recover the
time-machine thus your means of escape
will be assured no matter what happens
will you go with me i intend to make
the trip this very forenoon

of course i could not object to this and

i	was eager to accompany him apart from
any use which i myself might make of it
the time-machine was too rare and valua-
ble a thing to be left at the mercy of venus-
ian vandals who might well destroy it in
their campaign of nation-wide sabotage

kronous altus and myself made the
brief trip in the same light air-vessel
that had been used for the journey to
djarma the fertile luxuriant countryside
with fronded woods and tall airy spires of
embowered mansions above which we had
flown less than a week before was now
patched and blotched with devastation many
of the houses had been gutted by fire and
the ravages of the vegetable mould from
venus had blighted many fields and forests
whose grass and foliage rotted beneath it to
a nauseous grey slime

approaching the estate of kronous we
saw that we should arrive none too soon
the venusians had fired the house and even
their own quarters and columns of smoke
were arising from the doomed edifices a
dozen slaves were nearing the aerodrome
with the obvious intention of trying to set
it on fire or of destroying or damaging the
vessels which it contained

the features of kronous were deadly
pale with anger he said nothing as he
steered the atomic monoplane directly to-
ward the slaves who had now seen us and
were running headlong in a futile effort
to escape several of them had been car-
rying lighted torches which they now drop-
ped we swooped upon them flying only
a few feet above the ground in the open
space that surrounded the aerodrome

two of the slaves were caught and man-
gled by the sharp prow of the flier and
altus and myself using heat-ray projectors
accounted for five more as we passed them

only three remained and wheeling the ves-
sel around in a sharp curve and steering
with one hand kronous himself despatched
them with his heat-ray

we landed near the entrance of the aeio-
drome kronous went in and a minute
later the time-vessel flew gently forth and
settled on the platform kronous opened
the door and called to me

you and i hugh will return to djarma
in the time-ship and altus will take charge
of the monoplane

no more of the venusians were in sight
though wesaw enough of their handiwork
a-i we circled above the plantation before
starting for djarma kronous sighed at the
ruin that had been wrought but otherwise
he gave no evidence of emotion and main-
tained a stoical silence

half an hour later we were back in our
apartments in djarma and the time-machine
was securely housed in an aerodrome near-
by since it had all the appearance of a
small interplanetary flier no one but our-
selves ever dreamt of its real nature and
use

every hour brought fresh news of the na-
tional damage inflicted by the planetary
aliens and their plagues the martians had
now declared optfn hostility their first
movement had been to destroy all the human
embassies and trading-stations on mars and
to seize a vast amount of ether-shipping
but before these overt actions were gener-
ally known they had also assumed the of-
fensive everywhere on earth

they possessed a frightful weapon the
zero-ray which could penetrate animal tis-
sue in an instant with fatal frost-bite this
weapon had been kept a secret its invention
and mode of operation were obscure to hu-
man scientists and it was no less lethal and
effective than the heat-ray a battle was
now going on in the martian quarter of
djarma and the martians were holding
their own

air-vessels had tried dropping explosives
on the quarter but this was found to be
more dangerous to humanity than to the
martians for the latter were using some
sort of unknown ray which detonated the ex-

plosives in mid-air or even while they were
still on board the air-vessels

the death of a world

i was forced to marvel at the equanimity
shown by the people of akameria in
the face of all these dire problems and dan-
gers everywhere scientists were coolly en-
deavoring to combat the new pests and were
seeking to devise more efficacious weapons
for use against the outsiders no fear or
alarm was exhibited by anyone probably
the secret of this calm imperturbable atti-
tude lay in the lofty mental evolution and
philosophic detachment that had been uni-
versally attained by the human race thru the
past ages

knowing how insecure and impermanent
was their tenure of existence among the in-
imical forces of the cosmos men were pre-
pared to meet their doom with resignation
and dignity also the race had grown old
and many perhaps were tired of the quoti-
dian sameness of life and were ready to wel-
come anything no matter how hazardous in
the nature of change

djarma was now full of refugees from the
outlying plantations and more were arriv-
ing hourly but gazing on the calm unhur-
ried throng no one could have guessed the
parlousness of the general situation there
was no evidence of strife or peril or appre-
hension and even the war in the martian
quarter was conducted silently since the
weapons employed were all noiseless some
of the martian buildings however had been
fired by heat-rays and a pall of black smoke
was rising and mushrooming above the rud-
dy flames

djarma had suffered less so far than
most of the other akamerian centers the
whole country was in disorder and all com-
munication was becoming seriously derang-
ed however a few hours after the return
of kronous altus and myself there came
from southern akameria the warning of a
new and more lethal plague than any which
had hitherto appeared

a tiny venusian micro-organism a sort
of aerial algae which spread and increased

with phenomenal celerity had been turned
loose and was rendering the air unbreath-
able for human beings over a vast and
ever-growing area it was harmless to the
venusians themselves for the thick vapor-
ous air of their native jungles was full of
it and though it was deleterious to the
martians the latter had prepared them-
selves beforehand and were all equipped
with respiratory masks and atmospheric
filters

but men were dying of slow asphyxiation
marked by the most painful pneumonic
symptoms wherever overtaken by the
strange pest it was visible in the air
which displayed a saffron color when in-
vaded by the organism for this reason it
soon became known as the yellow death

beyond the manufacture and distribution
of air-masks on a large scale nothing could
be done by savants to combat the new
plague the saffron cloud was rolling
northward hour by hour-a noiseless and
irresistible doom and the situation was in-
deed desperate a conclave of scientists
was called and it was soon decided that
humanity must evacuate the regions menaced
by the dread aerial scourge the only re-
source was for men to retreat toward the
arctice circle and entrench themselves in
dominions where the organism could not
penetrate since it thrived only in warm
tropical air

this said kronous to me sorrowfully
is a preparatory step toward our final
abandonment of the earth the planetary
aliens have conquered as i knew they would
the cycle of human domination has com-
pleted itself and the future belongs to the
venusians and martians i venture to pre-
dict however that the martians will soon
enslave the venusians and rule them with
a far stricter hand than we humans

he went on hugh the hour of our
parting will soon arrive you could leave
us at any rate as you know but perhaps
you will wish to see the drama to its end

i pressed his hand but could say nothing
there was a tragic pathos in the swift doom
which threatened the final remnant of the
race remote and alien as these people
an adventure in futurity



were in many of their customs and ideas
and feelings they were still human i ad-
mired their stoical courage in the face of
irretrievable disaster and for kronous him-
self after our long association and mutual
vicissitudes i had conceived a real affection

all of djarma was now astir with pre-
parations for the northward flight
every air-vessel or space-craft available was
mustered for use and more were being
built with miraculous expedition there
were great air-liners and freighters in which
personal belongings food-supplies and lab-
oratory equipment were transported and the
skies were thronged with their departure and
their return for new cargoes perfect order
and organization prevailed and there was
no trace of hurry or confusion anywhere

kronous altus and myself were among
the last to leave an immense bank of
smoke was looming above the martian quar-
ter and the weird hydrocephalous inhabi-
tants were being driven forth by tfae flames
and were invading the deserted streets of
the human section when we rose above the
city in the time-vessel and steered north-
ward far to the south we could see a
saffron cloud that had covered the horizon
-the micro-organic plague that was smoth-
ering the whole of akameria

beneath the guidance of kronous our ves-
sel rose to a lofty elevation where more than
the ordinary atmospheric speed was possible
flying at seven hundred miles per hour we
soon neared the realms of perpetual winter
and saw the sheeted ice of the polar regions
glittering far below us

here humanity had already entrenched
itself and whole cities were being reared
as if by magic amid the eternal wastes of
snow laboratories and foundries were
erected where synthetic foods and fabrics
and metals were prepared in immense quan-
tities the polar domains however were
too inhospitable and the climate too rigor-
ous for a warmth-loving race to form more
than a way-station in the flight of humanity

it was decided that the larger asteroids
which had long been successfully colonized
by man would form the most suitable cosmic

refuge a great fleet of space-vessels was
soon assembled in readiness for departure
more were built amid the ice and snow and
each day was marked by the arrival of ships
from mid-ether plying among the planets
which had been warned by radio of existing
terrestrial conditions and had come to as-
sist in the universal hegira

in those days before the ultimate fare-
well i came to know kronous better than at
any previous time his altruism and im-
perturbable fortitude aroused my deepest
admiration of course he had cast in his
lot with the people of his own era and offi-
cial posts on one of the ether-liners had
already been assigned to altus and himself
those who displayed any interest in the
matter were informed by kronous that i
huno paskon intended to return alone in
a small ether-vessel to pallas my supposedly
natal asteroid even between ourselves we
seldom mentioned the real nature of my
journey

 kronous gave me careful instruction re-
garding the mechanism both spatial and
chronological of the time-machine but to
avoid any error he himself arranged all
the controls in preparation for my flight
through backward time all that i would
have to do was to turn on the power of the
cosmic rays and the machine would land
me in  then after it landed an auto-
matic device would shoot it back to his own
day

the day of departure came when vessels
were ready for the inter-cosmic transporta-
tion of the worlds remaining people it
was an awful and solemn moment ship by
ship and fleet by fleet from the ice-founded
platforms on which they had been resting
the long bulks of glittering metal soared
upon the aurora borealis and disappeared
in the chill dreadful gulfs of outer space
the ship to which kronous had been assign-
ed was one of the last to leave and he and
i stood for a long while beside the time-
vessel and watched the soaring of those
skyward flocks altus had already said
farewell to me and had gone aboard the
great ether-liner

he sent it up through the skylight into the mouth of the monster
another    and another   

for the tenth time within an hour and a
half the pilot of the tilden twin
amphibian reached for the radio-telephone
and called the bermuda station and for the
tenth time he placed the phone back on the
hook and sat there staring almost frantically
before him something had gone wrong
with the radio as the plane moved slowly
north he had been trying for almost two
hours to pick up bermuda over the nose the
compass indicator needle said so the gaso-
line left in his tank said so it was only a
matter of a few minutes until the last drop
of the precious stuff would ooze through the
lines to the carburetors of the two singing

rickman-conroff hummingbirds then they
would settle through the cushioning trop-
ical atmosphere down to the surface to drift
there until aid reached them that would
be a gamble since the radio was out

campbells eyes took in all the instru-
ments they rested on that compass before
him it wobbled suddenly yet the plane
did not turn she rode evenly smoothly
through the air like an ocean liner on a
glassy sea over his shoulder he saw one
of the seven passengers rise and go aft
then the needle turned again righted itself

the pilot started up at the man a hun-
dred thoughts rushed through his mind his

the sargasso monster



jaw set there was something familiar
about the passenger campbell had seen
him somewhere before could he be one
ot the spies of the companys rival any-
thing to play hell with the tilden liners

two of the ships had been thrown off
their course that way had drifted at sea for
days and days while patrol boats hunted for
them this would be the third within a
week demoralization yet campbell or
any of the others for that matter could
prove nothing hard
luck the company
heads had admitted

but the pilot of the
bolivar believed differ-
ently now he was al-
most certain of him-
self yet it was too
late to do anything
about it he was over
the sargasso already

too late had he asked
the compass station for
his bearings for he
had not suspected any-
thing the amphibian
had been flying
smoothly he had
been trying to pick up
the hore for two hours

and now the passen-
gers were looking at
him inquiringly one of
them a girl young and
slender found her way
up to his side and ask-
ed arent we off the
course captain

he looked upon the
brown mass that fring-
ed out into the blue off
there before him then
his eyes wandered to hers for the second
time that day-the first time had been at
rio-and he said evenly compass hay-
wire his voice lowered as he saw that
she look it calmly help me keep up the
morale of the passengers-well get out
ok

a great floating sea of dense weeds in the north
atlantic between  and  n and  and  wert

ill do all i can she answered simply
she asked no further questions like a
thoroughbred she walked gallantly back
down the aisle giving the questioning fel-
low passengers an answer that apparently
satisfied them

then the two riekman-conroff humming-
birds coughed and their steady drone died
down to a despairing wheeze campbell
pulled back on the wheel and held the big
plane at the stalling point he picked up
the transmitter and
called shore it didnt
answer he tried it
again nothing more
than the rattling buzz
of his own generator
unit greeted his ears
he slammed the trans-
mittter down and look-
ed to his plane

he was gliding swift-
ly through the light
mist that hung like a
veil over the mysteri-
ous sargasso he could
see only the long ex-
panse of seaweed with
an occasional break of
blue where the weed
did not cover the sur-
face he turned the
nose of the plane to-
ward a likely looking
spot and drifted gently
down to it soon the
spray was fountaining
about the plane and
she was checking
speed

the bolivar of the
 tilden airlines was
down in the sargasso
out of gasoline and her radio transmitter
out of order

captain campbell waited until the
plane came to a stop on the surface
then he turned to look squarely accusing-
ly the man who had returned to the front
seat his eyes blazed on the suspected
mans hands which went to the pockets of

 tf there is anything the
airplane is doing for us
it is opening up to our in-
spection parts of the world
that had remained previ-
ously unknown the map-
ping of ancient mayan
cities from the air is but
one example of the vast
new fields of research and
study made possible by
manrs new vehicle for
transportation

it is quite possible that
in isolated parts of the
globe the course of evolu-
tion of living things may
have been far different
than anything we know of
and that very matter of
isolation had previous to
the airplane prevented us
from learning about them
but now new wonders will
open to us

mr newton uses as his
theme the mysteries of the
little known sargasso sea
and he constructs a thrill-
ing chilling story of mys-
tery intrigue and adven-
re


wonder stories

a sport coat and the pockets bulged threat-
eningly

campbell had to admit to himself that he
knew nothing yet that he had no real
grounds to accuse the man of anything yet
the passengers eyes avoided his campbell
got to his feet revealing six feet of lithe
youth in a neat uniform his first thought
was of his passengers

we have been thrown off our course
something went wrong with the compass
he began it should not be long before
we are rescued in the meantime there is
little danger we are out of gasoline i
shall repair the radio and get in touch with
shore

they plied him with
questions which he an-
swered as best he could

on his way back to the
rear he saw the girl com-
forting an elderly lady
who had receded into the
cushions of the seat and
started weeping the girl
gave him a trusting look
and he smiled

he stopped before the
water fountain where the
man had gone for a
drink glancing beneath
it he saw a pair of com-
mon wire cutters lying
there and he also ob-
served the counterpoise
aerial that he used for
transmitting messages had been torn away
he thought of connecting the transmitter to
the receiving aerial but upon examining the
conduit that had contained the wires he saw
that they had been ripped out

his body came to a standing position
he whirled to see the man in the front seat
suddenly turn from watching him then it
occurred to him that he had not yet looked
over the passenger list to see who the man
was he took a card from his pocket and
checked it of the four men and three
women aboard-a scanty list to say the
least-he determined the man was bunyan
his jaw snapped when he saw the name
the tilden lines had once discharged him

for doctoring a plane paid by the rivals
he started forward again the girl stopped
him

that man up forward has been acting
queerly all along the trip she whispered
while the elderly lady at her side listened
closely to gather what was being said he
went back there several times the last
time he dropped a pair of pliers he started
to pick them up when he saw me looking
at him so he returned to his seat just
now he threw something out of the window
it looked like a ring of iron

a magnet said captain campbell

im not sure said the girl but camp-
bell did not hear her his hand suddenly
shot under his thin coat
and whipped out with an
automatic thinking to ar-
rest the man and put him
in confinement without
any argument but bun-
yan turned as suddenly
as he and there was a
gun in his own unsteady
hand campbell leaped
aside and a shot rang out
the passengers dropped
down between the seats
the elderly lady fainted
the girl did not scream
then the pilots gun went
into action but already
a bullet had torn along
his wrist cutting and
burning deep into the
flesh three times his gun blazed bunyan
lay still forward of the front seat

there was a sudden scurrying of pas-
sengers as the pilot-captain started
forward they leaped from their seats men
and women and ran aft just then camp-
bell sensed danger but before he could
move to a position of vantage bunyans
gun barked again a bullet stung camp-
bells side as he darted between the seals
then bunyan emptied his automatic camp-
bell heard the familiar click after the last
bullet had been spent he jeaped from his
kneeling position and ran forward he
was upon bunyan in an instant

edsel newton
the sargasso monster



his hands gripped the vandals arms like
the talons of an eagle he threw all his
weight upon the man bearing him down
upon the seat bunyans knee came up and
dealt him a fierce blow in the groin it
stunned the captain for a moment with a
terrifying pain yet he managed to deal
a fierce blow upon bunyans face he had
all but subdued his man when there came
a terrifying scream he lifted himself up
to follow the eyes of his passengers who
were staring out the windows he relaxed
his grip upon bunyan and leaped for the
steering wheel

the plane was being carried along in a
swift current through a channel of the
dreadful sargasso yet nothing he could do
would check its speed he kicked the rud-
der hoping to turn the nose of the plane
into the seaweed on either side of the chan-
nel but the plane did not respond in-
stead the current swept them along with
ever increasing speed

they were as helpless as if they had been
in a canoe without a paddle

campbell called to the passengers some
of you come forward and give me a hand
the three men passengers besides bunyan
started toward the captains cockpit but a
nasal voice ordered them to halt it was
bunyan who automatic in hand stood
against the panel between the captain and
his passengers he had campbells gun
too

but we want to hoist the outboard motor
into place said campbell what do you
mean anyway

a lot of help that outboard motor will
be with no fuel snapped bunyan were
going to stick it out campbell including
the ladies tilden paid me to check on you
and im on the job

thats a lie said campbell old man
tilden is the squarest shooter that ever liv-
ed youre working with that inter-con-
tinental gang bunyan youre a pirate
youre trying to demoralize my passengers
to make them think im incompetent the
rotten literature your outfit distributed
around buenos aires and new york didnt
work at least not altogether we still get

a few passengers and were going to pro-
tect them

thats strong talk campbell but it wont
get you anywhere answered bunyan a
sneer on his lips his eyes were bloodshot
from the scuffle of a few minutes before
he raised the gun and pointed it at the de-
fenseless pilot before campbell could
duck there came a deafening roar then an-
other 

chapter ii
in the maelstrom

 i e didnt hit you that time he heard
 -i the girl ask as he opened his eyes
to see her bending over him he was lying
across one of the wide seats and she had
been washing his face with cold water

i dont think so he said blinking it
was the one that hit me a few minutes ago
broke a rib i think ill be ok what
happened

this little lady put him out of business
with a little pearl handled  said one of
the three men who were looking on when
the maniac started to shoot she simply let
him have a dose of his own medicine
campbell rose to a sitting position to see
his enemy silting across the aisle bound
hand and foot a bandage encircled his
head his sullen face scowled when camp-
bell arose and started toward him but the
captain stopped suddenly and said ill
handle you later bunyan but if you dont
tell me where the wires you pulled from the
conduit are ill choke you to death he
stepped forward again his fingers bent as
if ready to clutch the neck of the vandal

theyre back there somewhere in the
ocean said bunyan wincing

the passengers gasped anger beyond
words welled up in the captain yet he
held himself in check and he said bunyan
ill make you pay for this if its the last
thing i ever do

with that he turned to look out the win-
dow the horrified eyes of the passengers
were already taking in the situation the
plane was being carried along at terrific


wonder stories

speed and a tailwind was blowing down
upon her

campbell hurried forward he unlocked
a box in the cockpit and began looking
around for spare pieces of wire but to no
avail he finally gave it up and turned to
give the steering wheel another last despair-
ing turn the plane did not respond he
swore under his breath and started to open
the window before him the wounded arm
pained as he held it up and he winced then
a pair of feminine hands reached forth and
raised the glass

thanks he said looking around at the
girl she stood close to him like a guar-
dian angel and thanks for saving my
life he continued

she sighed heavily i couldnt have
done anything else it was the most cow-
ardly thing in the world one of the men
is a doctor hell dress your wounds
but weve got to stop this drift he ex-
plained if we could manage to nose the
ship around into the seaweed wed have a
chance as it is god only knows where
well end up i never knew there was
such a thing he indicated the seemingly
endless channel that cut through the sea-
weed before them the growth on either
side was becoming thicker and thicker

but you cant stop a heavy ship like
this surely-in so swift a current

they stood looking at each other some-
thing about her thrilled the captain it
must have been her pluck she wasnt too
timid to shoot a murderer she wasnt
afraid of wherever they were going

you arent afraid of anything he said
whats your name

the straightforward manner of the cap-
tain brought a smile from the girl
she held out her hand

a physical coward is generally a moral
coward captain campbell the name is
rickman

you astound me he exclaimed ill
bet my wings youre marcine rickman

she nodded my father designed those
two motors out there pointir to the great
pair of hummingbirds that hung forward
but they wont run without gasoline

hardly he laughed well weve got
to think up some way of getting out of
this he started to climb up the steps to
the deck on the bow she assisted him for
he was obviously weak from loss of blood
one of the men had wrapped a handkerchief
around his wrist to stop the flow from the
deep wound therein that was perhaps
all that saved him

as they reached the deck the girl started
suddenly and gasped he followed her star-
ing eyes ahead of them they were bearing
down upon a whirlpool a literal maelstrom
the channel widened about it it swirled
threateningly carrying with it bits of sea-
week and debris even in this twilight hour
he could see it whirling like a gigantic ani-
mal waiting there to take the great plane
in its grasp and pull it down into the depths
of the sea and here even the wind seemed
to give way to the rush of the water

there was no longer the singing sound
in the struts and braces only the lash of
the eddying current broke the silence be-
fore they could dash below and close the
hatch the plane had nosed into it pan-
demonium broke loose among the passen-
gers the elderly lady and another woman
screaming

the three men sat pale-faced and helpless
bunyan sneered and laughed in turn and
while the captain and the girl stood there
before them the swirling eddy took hold
of the plane as the screams of the two
women reached their highest pitch some-
thing above them shattered into a wing
broke through and came crashing down
upon the top of the cabin it was a moment
when all were lost when only the miracle of
an unforeseen providence could help them

here you men jump there and close
the ports captain campbell barked as
he himself began closing the windows for-
ward every one of you sit tight- he
saw the girl as she was pitched across the
cabin others followed her

he had held to the top of the seat when
the eddy turned the ship about now he too
was lying sprawled upon the deck before
he could rise and assist marcine and the
other two women he was against hurled
downward this time to lie still until the

movement of the plane pitched him forward
among the terrified passengers before he
could get to his feet again the plane was
standing on her nose and they were all
thrown together before the door that opened
into the cockpit

campbell made a desperate plunge for a
stanchion caught it on the swing as the
plane reeled to port wrapped his feet about
it and reached for marcine her hands
were outstretched to receive his he pulled
her toward him she grasped the stanchion
and held on he then dived for a seat
reached it and pulled her after him while
the plane was steady for a moment he
strapped her in thfen he picked the elderly
lady from the deck and did likewise with
her one of the men managed to place the
other woman in a seat then when the wo-
men were assured the maximum of safety
the men sought their own seats gaining them
only by leaps when there came a lull in that
everlasting tossing and pitching but it did
not last for long as darkness fell upon the
plane only hopeless despair prevailed in
their spirits yet the girl smiled when cap-
tain campbell looked anxiously in her di-
rection

the maelstrom was tossing them around
now its whirl increasing in speed as the
plane was pulled toward the ortex in
that awful spiral the great amphibian was
twisted about now on her nose now on her
side with her wing down in the wash and
again with her gallant bows in the air like
a whale leaping to the surface it would
be a matter of only a few minutes the cap-
tain thought he might have had a chance
to save his passengers but for the crafty
bunyan who by all the laws of all the
lands was a pirate

his company had sought at great risk to
disable the tilden line it had begun
by placing bunyan in their employ in the
early days of the line when lawrence tilden
had sent the first big twin amphibians south-
ward on the trade routes between north and
south america bunyan had been a
traitor though he had failed in an effort
to wreck the first twin that went out on
the lone trek to the lands beyond the equator

for two years bunyan had waited then
something seemed to have struck every
tilden plane on the line he remembered
now how jimmy trevelyn was lost and
turned up six days later to say that a little
two-seater had come to take a single one
of his passengers off the disabled plane there
in the caribbean leaving a dozen more
starving passengers staring at the fortunate
man for whom the plane had come and
jimmys radio had been disabled

well there was one thing for which cap-
tain campbell could be thankful bunyan
would share the fate of the rest whatever
it was and it seemed certain that it would
be terrible perhaps the bottom of the
sea 

the captain started and looked at the girl
her eyes were burning into his as if she
wanted to say something to him he went
to her side risking being thrown against
the deck or overhead and while he braced
himself to look down into her appealing
face she still smiled there was nothing to
be said this was one of those unearthly
moments when conversation was out but as
far as that went the girl told him all with
her eyes she was telling him that she ad-
mired him for having done his best to avoid
the disaster that she was not afraid that
they would be together wherever they went

but the swirl of the vortex did not take
them down by a miracle just as they
gained speed a wind caught the plane and
lifted it up it seemed to tremble unstead-
ily for a moment nose upward slightly
and drift back under the pressure of a
sudden gust

the amphibian landed tail down with a
resounding smack and lay quite stilj upon
the southermost side of the open channel
beyond the vortex beyond the rushing cur-
rent and beyond human aid

again the wind took her and tossed her
about it screamed down upon them as
captain campbell made an effort to open
the forward hatch and go out on the deck
and shook the amphibian from nose to tail
it blasted against the helpless plane until
it had to move and then carried it along with
ease across the darkened mass of brown
finally landing it nose downward into some-


wonder stories

thing that gave enough to prevent a crash
even then something crackled and broke
until the strain and the great plane seemed
to fall upon its side it righted itself when
it struck the soft bed of weeds and at last
lay still there in the dark night while the
fierce tropical wind howled about them

chapter iii

the continent of seaweed

they remained awake almost all the
night the women did not sleep two
of the men dozed the others including
the captain and marcine rickman probed
the darkness beyond the windows but it
was useless the sky overhead was inky
even campbells penetrating flashlight re-
vealed nothing more than a wide cushion of
seaweed the stuff had grown so thick that
it could have supported a ship it had drift-
ed together at the edge of the whirlpool
thrown clear and accumulated

campbell searched the plane for wire
with which he hoped to repair the radio
the new sleeping bunyan had wrecked but
he found that every piece of wire had been
pulled from the conduit the cables in the
steering apparatus wouldnt work they
were of common wire even then he dis-
covered that all the aerial wire in the world
wouldnt help them in the fall of the plane
against the seaweed a strut had broken
through the forward end of the cabin just
above the water line and torn away the
transmitter what a complete misfortune
a few hours before they had been flying
safely now they were cut off from com-
munication with the civilized world lying
on a bank of seaweed in the mysterious sar-
gasso in the dead of the night

it looks like a diet of seaweed cap-
tain

campbell startled looked again at the
girl

oh i forgot we can have some sand-
wiches theyre in the buffet-already pre-
pared theres coffee too

thats luck she said turning aft to get
them while campbell flashed his light
through the inky darkness to determine

whether the motors were still holding she
served the other passengers with food she
brought delicate portions forward and they
sat side by side in the pilots seat eating
them her presence seemed to assure the
captain that he would come through yet
when he realized the apparent hopelessness
of the situation he shuddered he marveled
that even the women could sleep but mar-
cine herself was soon dozing

he woke with the sun in his face streak-
ing through the window at his left his
right arm was around the girls shoulder
he withdrew it when he heard footsteps
back of the curtain in the main cabin two
of the men were pacing back and forth their
faces white and unshaven a worried look
in their bloodshot eyes

campbell rose and looked over the bow
and utterly strange sight met his eyes he
gave a startled gasp that aroused the girl
so that she too stood up and looked they
were on an island of seaweed it piled up
in mounds and cliffs as far as they could
see it steamed like the jungle they had
seen when flying over brazil and it was
silent like a pleistocene swamp-silent and
dead

at least we arent sunk exclaimed
marcine as if this were a commonplace ad-
venture

campbell lost all sense of anxiety then
save for the immediate comfort of his pas-
sengers

well come out he said will you
continue to help me with the passengers
you know even those men are frightened
out of their wits

you forget the passengers she laughed
i found some more excellent emergency
rations in the buffet and theres water
enough to last awhile while youre explor-
ing the surrounding country ill prepare
breakfast she turned suddenly and went
aft leaving him staring across the wastes
of sea weed a literal continent of it

he was inspecting the broken radio trans-
mitter when she came with his break-
fast after drinking the coffee which was
excellent he looked aft all the passengers
were silent  unlike most crowds in a crisis
the sargasso monster



they did not talk of their troubles the
men scowled at bunyan one of them car-
ter of the metropolitan and international
bank threatened to smash bunyans face
after having taken the thongs off his legs and
wrists thomason and mills the other two
were chatting with the two woman the elder-
ly lady and the middle-aged woman who had
screamedso loudly

when the captain went back into the
cabin they all looked up as if they expected
him to work some sort of a miracle and
take them on to their destination he tried
to smile at them but he could not bring
himself to meet their tragic stare while he
stood there they began to venture timid
questions

ill be frank with you people he said
finally i know no more than you do the
radio is out it is doubtful that well be
able to get out of this mess without outside
help the left wing as you see is crum-
pled its fortunate that the cabin is left
intact well have to work together and
make the best of it im going to explore
the surroundings if you wish two of you
may follow me the others will remain
aboard

thomason and carter rose to their feet
and stepped forward the banker handed
campbell one of the pistols he had taken
from bunyan which the captain pocketed
glancing sidewise at his enemy

there wont be any plane to come out
and pick you up leaving the rest of us to
drift the captain told him if you had
one following us its pilot was too yellow
to set down where we did

with that the captain followed by the
two men turned and climbed through the
hatch but out on deck he thought of mar-
cine he had not seen her inside the cabin
after breakfast hurrying back down the
steps he called for her

the young lady went outside while you
were talking to us said mills

campbell turned on his heel and ran back

the bow he told thomason and carter
of marcines disappearance the three of
them leaped to the matted seaweed and
started off at a run toward the mounds that
lay before them campbell searching for

traces of her footsteps but so tangled was
the mass that he could distinguish noth-
ing

the three halted when they came around
the second mound and listened campbell
yelled the girls name they waited but
there came no answer to their calls only
the scurrying of several strange reptile-like
monsters broke the silence that hung over
them

an iguana the size of a florida alligator
lay blinking at them from one of the
smaller mounds a giant sea turtle twenty
feet across with a head over three feet in
diameter advanced toward them its great
soft body ambled over the tangled weed
even three shots from campbells automatic
did not stop the turtle thinking to save
their ammunition the men hurried on but
ere they had advanced twenty yards they
were stopped suddenly by a womans
scream which came from ahead of them
then shots rang out and all was silent once
more

the sargasso monster

campbell ran forward and topped an-
other mound of seaweed from there
he looked southward on the top of another
mound he saw the girl and called to her
she did not answer instead she leveled
her gun at something below her and pumped
several shots at it she screamed again as
he darted forward dashing ahead camp-
bell came upon the mound just as she finish-
ed emptying the  again she turned
like a helpless child and ran to him as
he caught her up she looked over his shoul-
der and screamed again he turned and
what he saw chilled his blod and froze him
to inaction

it was a nightmarish monster seventy
feet long and built like an eel its huge
mouth could easily have swallowed five men
at once and it was emerging from the
slimy depths of a swamp and encircling the
mound thomason and carter also froze
when they saw it their advance was cut
off by its threatening jaws it raised its
head toward campbell and marcine and
came slowly toward them


wonder stories

in an instant campbell reloaded his au-
tomatic and leveled it at the monster three
shots seemed to take no great effect in
fact they only antagonized the thing its
tail which was blunt- and almost as big
abound as its body came swishing out of the
slime the monstrous jaws were open and
it was not more than fifteen feet from them
before campbell chanced another shot the
automatic that marcine had now reloaded
came into play then what happened amaz-
ed the captain

the plucky girl had shot the monsters
eyes out

he leveled his own gun down upon the
same spots sending shot after shot from his
heavy  into the things mouth and to a
tiny round bump on the top of its head
but those immense slimy jaws were coming
down upon them

they backed off the other side of the
mound together leaped sideways just in time
to avoid a brush of its heavy tail and scur-
ried to cover behind another mound leav-
ing thomason and carter to shift for them-
selves more shots rang out presumably
from the bankers gun there was a terri-
fying yell it died suddenly

weve got to watch our step said camp-
bell calmly lets make our way back to
the plane

but its on the end of a peninsula and
were cut off by that thing objected mar-
cine loading her automatic with deft fingers

campbell pushed up th side of another
mound from its top they could see carter
making his way back to the plane thomason
was not in sight

what could have happened to him
said the pilot the girl groaned and point-
ed to a spot just behind the retreating car-
ter where a giant turtle was struggling
with something in its jaws they turned
their eyes terrified beyond speech

why couldnt that have been bunyan
thought the pilot shuddering because he
could not avoid it marcine was clinging
to his arm sobbing hysterically together
they found the power to turn and look again
carter had disappeared over a mound in
the direction of the plane the turtle lay
still their eyes followed the ground over

which they had escaped the terrible jaws
of the sargasso monster it lay very still
its head upon the mound from the relaxed
position of its body campbell concluded it
was dead taking marcine silently by the
arm he suggested that they return immedi-
ately to the plane

but before they had gone tenr-paces a
new horror gripped them what they
saw as they came upon a new mound of sea-
weed struck terror to their souls and sent
their blood running cold their senses
reeled and they stood there frozen to the
spot

an animal of such proportions that the
largest african elephant would have looked
like a pigmy at its side was slowly creeping
up from the slime of a nearby marsh if
it was a saurian it was of a species differ-
ent from anything in the records of any
museum of natural history or archaeological
research it was over a hundred feet in
length and lay like a huge worm a great
leather-like bloated beastly thing with a
head slightly smaller than its body and eyes
that glared out from the great sockets

only one thing the captain had ever seen
could have so reminded him of its shape was
a long flexible sausage save for the head
and the mouth which was round and so
big- that it could have swallowed the two
of them without the slightest effort even
as they watched one of the great sea lizards
that resembled an iguana darted by and
was quickly covered by the cup-like lips of
the monster

and while the victim uttered a piercing
scream much like a captured rabbit only
louder-much louder-it was drawn into the
jaws of the monster and swallowed

the thing gulped with a satisfying blink
of its hideous eyes and then advanced upon
them

marcine screamed campbell steadied her
and looked around behind them in the op-
posite direction from the plane was only
the waste of the sargasso there might be
waiting for them there terrors far greater
than those they had already experienced
but he must take a gamble with fate

speaking as calmly as possible as they
the sargasso monster



lurried back down the mound he said
steady marcine well find our way out
over there ahead of us

he was pointing to the southeast he did
not realize that something unexpected await-
ed them just over the next mound and the
monster was coming toward them slowly
emerging from the marsh and revealing sev-
eral fin-like feet that slapped against the
weed with each lumbering step they gain-
ed the top of the largest mound in the vicin-
ity stopped a minute to look around at the
advancing monster which was over two hun-
dred yards away and then started on down
the slope they stopped suddenly as if
they had confronted a brick wall and looked
with stark amazement at the sight before
them

chapter iv
a world of monstrosities

before the pair on the mound was
stretched a level plain that reached out
to the horizon and probably beyond a lit-
eral island of seaweed thrown up here by
the numerous whirlpools and decayed as the
years fled on either side of the island were
tangled masses of the weed reaching out
into the sea but apparently always thrown
back to the main mass by the tides and the
currents that rushed toward the different
whirlpools about it vegetation grew here
much as that of the amazon valley a few
palms dotted the landscape a myriad of
colours told of flowers in profusion

great flocks of birds lifted from the
ground near campbell and marcine and
fluttered into the sky and off with the wind
to the opposite shore but what struck them
most at this moment were the thousand
round-shaped objects that rolled about the
surface of the water at the edge of the is-
land some of them being thrown ashore by
the tide others rolling across the island as
if propelled by the wind yet no wind was
blowing

they did not stop long to view the strange
land that hideous monster was behind
them it had gained and was now only a
hundred yards behind them its great bulk

loomed up over the mound now its huge
cup-like lips were extended and it was puff-
ing as if from exertion the two ran down
the hill before them reaching the level
ground just as the monster gained the top
they kept fleeing not daring to waste a
minute or a single breath in speech yet
when marcine chanced a glance backward
she screamed hysterically and pointed even
while gathering her limp body into his
arms campbell saw that the thing had
turned sidewise was beginning to roll down
toward them his own sense of action left
him for a second his brain failed him his
memory was gone he was stunned to in-
sensibility yet that powerful something that
lies deep down in the being of a man caused
him to move to try to run to realize his
position with the girl to protect

still that mountain of flesh was rolling
down toward them was almost upon them
before the captain realized it with the
very last ounce of his strength called upon
to aid him in flight he leaped with his pre-
cious burden out upon the level plain he
was seventy or more yards away when the
beast crashed down the slope only to
break through the thin crust that formed
the island and disappear with a few gurgling
sounds below the surface

campbell heard it and turned to see that
the weight of the gigantic monster had caus-
ed its own defeat how heavenly fortun-
ate he gasped

floating islands are like that said a
voice near his ears

he looked up into the girls eyes

gosh i thought you were out he said
quickly thankful that her swoon had not
lasted longer

gee but youre a man she said you
saved our lives

we save our own lives every day we
leap from before automobiles and street
cars we make forced landings and make
medicine-whats the difference

you ask that question because you dont
know the difference-because you dont see
the difference if you were some other sort
of a man like bunyan youd know what i
mean or if you were a timid woman-
timid he laughed then he realized


wonder stories

that his heart was pounding he tried to
lie to himself and say that it was because
of the scare the monster had given him he
let her slide gently to her feet

lets not get into a discussion on psychol-
ogy well find a way to get out of this
if i have to build an airplane

she looked at her wrist watch why
we been out here only three hours it
seems like an age ago since we left the
plane

and its likely only a split second in the
time of those monsters they must be thou-
sands of years old im trying to make out
what those round things can be he pointed
across the seaweed island several balls the
height of which looked to be about ten feet
were rolling slowly upon the beach

marcine studied them a minute it must
be some sort of vegetation peculiar to this
strange land she speculated

but as they looked they saw that the
things were propelled by a sort of tentacle
arrangement a band of them extending
around the leathery ball as two of the
strange things moved in their direction they
saw that the balls never touched the ground
but were held up in the air by the tenta-
cles as the ball rotated the tentacle-legs
reached forward carried the weight until
another leg came around and then receded
to lie flat against the sides of the ball

the two that were coming toward them
were moving with express train speed

monsters-of some sort gasped camp-
bell weve got to dive back up the hill
watch your step

i wont faint again said the girl gath-
ering her breath they skirted the edge
of the hole where the gigantic monster had
disappeared and started up the incline even
as they ran they looked back to see the balls
gaining upon them but something moved
in the weeds in the path of one of them
it looked like a sea lion it could not move
swiftly

the ball bore down upon it  then it
opened on one side like an orange being
cut in two and the great mouth closed down
upon the unfortunate seal the other mon-

ster continued to roll toward campbell and
marcine but when it reached the incline
it slowed down

at close range campbell took careful
aim and sent two shots from his  colt at
the thing it stopped dead still and its
tentacle-legs lowered it to the ground it
rolled back into the same hole wherein had
disappeared the gigantic monster and lay
very still upon the surface of the water the
other ball was also motionless it was sat-
isfied with the meal it had obtained

a world of monstrosities exclaimed the
captain

the girl did not answer he looked at
her suddenly and he saw that she was reel-
ing as she walked he caught her up in
his arms as her limp body gave way to the
strain that had been upon it he hurried
quickly toward the plane

but before the captain on his way back
to the plane with the burden of the lovely
marcine in his arms lay hazards that come
under the heading of things hideous and ter-
rifying only the intelligence that held
forth above the universe could know how he
managed to escape the threatening jaws of
another of the great monsters that looked
like an eel or how his gun in his free
hand happened to stop the charging trunk
turtle that was so large it could have swal-
lowed him with one gulp the crocodiles
and gigantic iguanas were like so many pets
in comparison to the greater animals that
had threatened their lives

yet it was not long before campbell top-
ped a mound to see the plane lying there
motionless tears filled his eyes as he look-
ed at his great amphibian she had been
the pridof his heart now she lay with
one wing dug deep into the mass of seaweed
and crumpled the other extended to the sky
to invite the first fierce gust of wind that
came down upon the sargasso

he collapsed as carter and mills hurried
out to the listing deck to meet them the
strain of the past twenty-four hours left him
weak and near to helplessness yet within
ar hour he sat up in his improvised bed and
inquired about his passengers carter
hesitatingly told him of thomasons death
it was not until then that he learned that the
the sargasso monster



unfortunate passenger was the doctor mar-
cine had mentioned the evening before

tt ut you have a nurse captain said
 mills smiling

and what a nurse said campbell look-
ing up to see marcine standing over him

she didnt say anything bad about you
continued mills how about those mon-
sters-are we in any danger

imminent danger said carter looking
to campbell for confirmation

if one of those things finds us here were
sunk agreed campbell he sat up sud-
denly and demanded looking about him
where is bunyan

when carter got back he sent him for a
walk said mills dryly there was just a
faint trace of a smile on his lips

for- campbell stopped suddenly
there wasnt really any use to start an argu-
ment he shrugged his shoulders well
all of you saw how he tried to kill me

the two men nodded and walked away
the two women the elderly one and the
middle aged one were preparing food over
the emergency gasoline stove they brought
a bowl of milky soup and placed it before
campbell on the hinged table

as he slowly sipped it he thought over
the circumstance that confronted them it
was likely that other planes of the tilden
lines were searching for them but would
they come far off the course here beyond the
latitude where he had been forced down
would they discover the rushing current that
carried everything far into the dark and my-
sterious sargasso and follow it across the
maelstrom

they could only hope for rescue some-
where out there on the opposite shore of the
strange island might lie a disabled ship
there might even be human inhabitants
but to reach them was something like old
lawrence tilden would term flirting with
hell and that would be foolish those
ball monsters would rush even a dozen men
the gigantic eel-like things the turtles and
that nameless creature so big that it would
pigmy a whale stood y the way

campbells thoughts were interrupted by
a single glance at the figure of marcine out-

lined against the silken curtain up forward
but they were interrupted for only a minute
the sight of her made him all the more de-
termined to effect an escape he arose in
spite of the warning of the two women and
hurried into the pilots cockpit an idea
occured to him

there were rockets in the cabinet behind
the fire extinguisher he took his keys and
unlocked the cabinet bringing iorth a dozen
of them why hadnt he thought of them
before where had been that pilots sense
of responsibility why there was little
need of a plane being entirely lost of its
crew and passengers being hopeless he
placed an armful of the rockets before the
astonished girl she picked one up and ex-
amined it but did not speak

send up three every five minutes he
said under his breath he took out his
cigar lighter and held it ready he placed
one of the rockets in the slots that had been
provided on the side of the cabin for that
purpose and then touched it off it hissed
for a second and then leaped into space
sailing high into the sky and bursting a
prolonged flame hung where it exploded
then the flame died suddenly and a black
cloud took its place so black and dense that
it could not help but attract the most casual
glance of a lookout or a cruising plane
several minutes passed before the cloud dis-
solved into the blue of the sargasso sky
then one after another of the rockets were
dispatched some going higher than others
some lasting longer after an hour he
looked at the number that lay before them

well rest a while he announced
youd better go below and take it easy
marc-miss rickman ill have carter and
mills on watch up here

ifanything happens you can depend up-
on me she said and her hand brushed his
ever so slightly as she turned to go

but she did not reach the cabin hatchway
before she screamed and pointed off to the
starboard side of the plane campbell
followed her gaze what he saw so terrified
and unnerved him that he was frozen in his
tracks it was one of those huge monsters
like the one that had rolled after them down
the slope but this one was much bigger


wonder stories

and looked more ferocious as it ambled to-
ward them its fin-like feet slapping against
the cushioning seaweed and its gloating
monstrous eyes fastened upon them

chapter v

the last stand

et below-quickly snapped camp-

vjt bell he followed marcine down the
steps and closed the hatch after them close
all the ports he snapped again that
thing means business every one be still and
silent if it sees you move it will crush this
cabin between its jaws

the middle aged woman sobbed the
older one fainted the former became mad
with fright

take care of her ordered campbell to
marcine who smiling bravely went aft to
the stricken woman and took her hands and
held them gently merciful oblivion took
possession of her carter and wells were
running about the cabin aimlessly like
frightened inmates in a cell of death

snap out of it fellows-ill need you
sang out the pilot if anyone here has to
die ill go first and show you how easy it
is

carter looked up something of the fel-
lowship of men that kindred feeling that
too seldom motivates the acts of men in
desperate situations seemed to have crept
over him

easy to die-the words of service both
of the men looked up then they stood
calmly before him campbell simply glanc-
ed between them and marcine rickman he
thought they caught his meaning

drop to the floor and lie still if it
menaces the plane use these he handed
each of them several of the rockets they
took out matches and made ready

marcine having disposed of the two help-
less women by leaving them relaxed in utter
abandon upon the soft cushions came for-
ward and followed the example of the others
taking a handful of the rockets campbell
knelt beside her a single open porthole
kept their attention

i hope it swallows one of my dads mo-

tors and chokes whispered the girl at the
pilots side

one of them running added campbell

the monster of the dim past came closer
and stopped it raised its gigantic head
like a conquering monarch nothing they
had ever seen or dreamed of having seen was
so gigantic or repulsive its great cup-like
mouth was pink inside the lips were ex-
tended toward the plane a dozen feet from
it it loomed up over the helpless ship
its fin-like feet slapping the ground an
amphibious carnivore campbell knew for
his learning in ancient and natural history
had taught him something of the animals
of ancient seas this giant saurian ate flesh
perhaps it could smell them if it had
enough instinct to know that they were in-
side the cabin

it ambled forward two lumbering steps
bringing it directly over the plane its mouth
was open and its gigantic lips were almost
touching the skylight directly over campbell
and marcine slowly the head descended
upon them part of the upper wing crim-
pled as if it were made of tissue

terror struck the souls of them panic
seized them one of the woman screamed
wells dived beneath a seat and lay there
sobbing campbell whispered for them to
be silent someone fell over his feet it
was marcine she got up and ran aft
opened a port hole set a rocket in its and
touched it off there was a blinding flash
a hiss and the rocket was gone

campbell reached for his own bundle of
rockets he held one in his bare handsi and
sent it up through the skylight into the
mouth of the monster another and another
ho let go as the great lips began to close
the rockets burst inside the saurian there
was a resounding blast and then another
that was muffled when the lips closed upon
the fourth rocket that entered its mouth the
head swung away on the bulging neck and
the thing started on

as it lumbered by them one of its great
feet crushed a motor off the wing and into
the soft weeds campbell discharged his
automatic into the side of the monster

the foot barely missed the forward end
of the cabin like a huge sea lion it drag-
the sargasso monster



ged on past the panic-stricken women were
shrieking they were pointing out the port-
holes toward the saurians tail it was held
high ready to crush down upon them sev-
eral rockets blinded the captains eyes

the tail swung closer and splintered the
wing one of those ten-foot-wide finny
feet scraped the nose of the cabin breaking
it off a huge claw a foot thick and four
times as long was sunk through the deck
but it was soon raised and the beast moved
again

but the rockets were bursting beneath it
where they had fallen to the ground where
was marcine she was not in the cabin
campbell hurried aft calling for her
through the porthole aft he saw her shad-
ow she was standing on the tail of the
plane letting the rockets fly away at the
touch of a match one after another they
hissed and flew away as campbell climbed
through the hatch and started to pull her
down into the cabin

get your people aftshe yelled look

following her finger he saw a black speck
in the sky off there to the north it was far
away and so small that he could not de-
termine whether it was a seaplane or a diri-
gible but it was surely coming toward them

bring more rockets pleaded the girl

campbell dropped through the hatch

as he herded his passengers aft the tail
of the monster struck it splintered through
the top of the cabin breaking off the nose
the pilots cockpit and the other motor but
the lumbering mass of the thing was moving
away its leather-like sides were heaving
and its feet were slapping the ground its
great length dragged by them slowly it
was several yards away when the first blast
of the rickman-conroff hummingbirds on
the big tilden twin came to their ears
while they stood there elated beyond words
the big amphibian slid gently down across
the whirlpool swayed over the mound and
went into a turn when it came back it
landed in the water not a hundred feet from
the plane

hey campbell what the devils that
yelled jimmy trevelyn of the tilden air-
lines super-pilot and an all-weather airman

the

from the cockpit of his amphibian as the
six people came toward the plane he indi-
cated the monster

i think its bunyans grave answered
the now elated campbell dragging his heavy
feet forward to shake trevelyns hand

lets get out of this mess-you can tell
me all about it when weve lifted said
jimmy opening the door of the cabin thp
two women and carter and wells hurried
inside all dropped to waiting seats in com-
plete exhaustion campbell and marcine
followed into the pilots compartment

i had a line on bunyan explained
trevelyn he was the fellow who was
picked off my plane that day leaving the
rest of us to drift that scuttler went ashore
and disappeared it was three days before
the base knew our location and he had
promised to send a plane after us the minute
he landed the fellow who picked him off
claimed to have been following my ship
so as to be certain of keeping on the course
but that magnet story of yours explains
things i was out in the caribbean over a
hundred miles off the course and bearing
west when the compass should have read
northeast

well he wont play that game again
strangely it was not until that moment
that he thought of introducing marcine to
the pilot she had stood there listening
without comment i beg your pardon
marcine he said this is my old flying
mate jimmy trevelyn she can send rockets
higher than any one i know jimmy

thats how i found you said jimmy
bowing as the plane leveled off far up over
the brown and blue sargasso i cruised all
day when i was about to give it up and
go back to key west i saw one of those
blackball rockets you sent up burst out over
the most unlikely looking part of the whole
ocean ill bet my wings theres something
more in the story than youve told me
automatically at his words campbell 
and the girl looked into each others eyes
after that for a full twenty minutes jimmy
trevelyn gazed straight ahead over the nose
of the amphibian nor did he turn his eyes
when he said thered almost have to be

it was a great brain it lay in the chamber its surface ridged and
wrinkled by innumerable fine convolutions


the man who evolved



there were three of us in pollards
house on that night that i try vainly
to forget dr john pollard himself hugh
dutton and i arthur wright-we were the
three pollard met that night a fate whose
horror none could
dream dutton has
since that night inhab-
ited a state institution
reserved for the insane
and i alone am left to
tell what happened

it was on pollards
invitation that dutton
and i went up to his
isolated cottage we
three had been friends
and room-mates at the
new york technical
university our friend-
ship was perhaps a lit-
tle unusual for pol-
lard was a number of
years older than dut-
ton and myself and
was different in tem-
perament being rather
quieter by nature he
had followed an inten-
sive course of biolog-
ical studies too in-
stead of the ordinary
engineering courses
dutton and i had tak-

had inherited but since then we had had
no word from him and had been somewhat
surprised to receive his telegrams inviting
us to spend the week-end with him

it was drawing into early-summer twi-
light when dutton and

en

as dutton and i
drove northward along
the hudson on that af-
ternoon we found our-
selves reviewing what
we knew of pollards
career we had known
of his taking his mas-
ters and doctors de-
grees and had heard
of his work under
braun the vienna biol-

nnhere is no more fas-
- cinating subject of
speculation for man than
that concerning his change
through the millions of
years of his life from the
simple one-celled animal to
his present high state of
development

even today eminent biol-
ogists differ as to the forces
that raised us from the
primordial slime and gave
us the intelligence and
power to create a great
civilization - with its im-
pressive mechanical forces
its art literature and cul-
ture

the doctrine of darwin
that we changed because
only the fittest species could
survive does not explain
anything the idea f
shaw that we changed be-
cause we wanted to change
is more understandable but
less convincing science is
working feverishly to find
the true force or forces
that cause mutations

the second question that
we dwell upon is what will
be the road of our evolu-
tion is our path a spiral
ever upward to newer and
newer glories and greater
achievements or does the
mystic future hold things
that are strange incredible
or even horrible our well-
known author answers some
of these questions in this
most engrossing story

ogist whose theories
had stirred up such turmoil we had heard
casually too that afterwards he had come
back to plunge himself in private research
at the country-house beside the hudson he

i reached a small riv-
erside village and were
directed to pollards
place a mile or so be-
yond we found it
easily enough a splen-
did old pegged-frame
house that for a hun-
dred-odd years had
squatted on a low hill
above the river its
outbuildings were
clustered around the
big house like the
chicks about some pro-
tecting hen

pollard himself came
out to greet us why
you boys have grown
up was his first ex-
clamation here ive
remembered you as
hughie and art the
campus trouble-raisers
and you look as though
you belong to business
clubs and talk everlast-
ingly about sales-re-
sistance

thats the sobering
effect of commercial
life dutton explain-
ed grinning it
hasnt touched you
you old oyster-you
look the same as you
did five years ago

he did too his
lanky figure and slow
smile and curiously
thoughtful eyes having
changed not a jot yet
seemed to show some
usual excitement and i

pollards bearing
rather more than
commented on it

if i seem a little excited its because this


wonder stories

is a great day for me he answered

well you are in luck to get two fine fel-
lows like dutton and me to trail up to this
hermitage of yours i began but he shook
his head smilingly

i dont refer to that art though im
mighty glad youve come as for my hermi-
tage as you call it dont say a word against
it ive been able to do work here i could
never have done amid the distractions of a
city laboratory

his eyes were alight if you two knew
what-but there youll hear it soon enough
lets get inside-i suppose youre hungry
hungry-not i i assured him 
might devour half a steer or some trifle like
that but i have really no
appetite for anything else
today

same here dutton
said i just pick at my
food lately give me a
few dozen sandwiches and
a bucket of coffee and i
consider it a full meal

well well see what
we oan do to tempt your
delicate appetites said
pollard as we went in-
side

we found his big house
comfortable enough with
long low-ceilinged rooms
and broad windows look-
ing riverward after put-
ting our bags in a bed-
room and while his housekeeper and cook
prepared dinner pollard escorted us on a
tour of inspection of the place we were
most interested in his laboratory

it was a small wing he had added to the
house of frame construction outside to har-
monize with the rest of the building but
inside offering a gleaming vista of white-
tiled walls and polished instruments a big
cube-like structure of transparent metal
surmounted by a huge metal cylinder re-
sembling a monster vacuum tube took up
the rooms center and he showed us in an
adjoining stone-floored room the dynamos
and motors of his private power-plant

night had fallen by the time we finished

dinner the meal having been prolonged
by our reminiscences the housekeeper and
cook had gone pollard explaining that the
servants did not sleep in the place we sat
smoking for a while in his living-room dut-
ton looking appreciatively around at our
comfortable surroundings

your hermitage doesnt seem half-bad
pollard he commented i wouldnt mind
this easy life for a while myself

easy life repeated pollard thats
all you know about it hugh the fact is
that ive never worked so hard in my life
as ive done up here in the last two years
what in the world have you been work-
ing at i asked something so unholy
youve had to keep it
hidden here

a mad scheme

pollard chuckled
thats what they
think down in the village
they know im a biologist
and have a laboratory
here so its a foregone
conclusion with them that
im doing vivisection of
a specially dreadful na-
ture thats why the ser-
vants wont stay here at
night

as a matter of fact
he added if they knew
down in the village what
ive really been working on theyd be ten
times as fearful as they are now

are you trying to play the mysterious
great scientist for our benefit dutton de-
manded if you are youre wasting time
-i know you stranger so take off that
mask

thats right i told him if youre
trying to get our curiosity worked up youll
find we can scram you as neatly as we could
five years ago

which scramming generally ended in
black eyes for both of you he retorted
but ive no intention of working up your
curiosity-as a matter of fact i asked you

i

edmond hamilton
the man who evolved



up here to see what ive been doing and
help me finish it

help you echoed dutton what can
we help you do-dissect worms som
week-end i can see right now

theres more to this than dissecting
worms pollard said he leaned back and
smoked for a little time in silence before
ho spoke again

do you two have any knowledge at all
of evolution he asked

i know that its a fighting word in some
states i answered and that when you say
it youve got to smile damn you

he smiled himself i suppose youre
aware of the fact however that all life on
this earth began as simple uni-cellular proto-
plasm and by successive evolutionary muta-
tions or changes developed into its present
forms and is still slowly developing

we know that much-just because were
not biologists you neednt think were totally
ignorant of biology dutton said

shut up dutton i warned whats
evolution got t do with your work up here
pollard

it is my work up here pollard answer-
ed

he bent forward ill try to make this
clear to you from the start you know or
say you know the main steps of evolution-
ary development life began on this earth
as simple protoplasm a jelly-like mass from
which developed small protoplasmic organ-
isms from these developed in turn sea-
creatures land-lizards mammals by suc-
cessive mutations this infinitely slow evo-
lutionary process has reached its highest
point so far in the mammal man and is still
going on with the same slowness

this much is certain biological knowl-
edge but two great questions concerning this
process of evolution have remained hitherto
unanswered first what is the cause of
evolutionary change the cause of these slow
steady mutations into higher forms sec-
ond what is the future course of mans
evolution going to be what will the forms
into which in the future man will evolve
and where will his evolution stop those
two questions biology has so far been un-
able to answer

pollard was silent a moment and then
said quietly i have found the answer to
one of those questions and am going to
find the answer to the other tonight

we stared at him are you trying to
spoof us i asked finally

im absolutely serious arthur i have
actually solved the first of those problems
have found the cause of evolution

what is it then burst out of dutton
what it has been thought by some biolo-
gists for years to be pollard answered
the cosmic rays

the cosmic rays i echoed the
vibrations from space that millikan discov-
ered

yes the cosmic rays the shortest wave-
length and most highly penetrating of all
vibratory forces it has been known that
they beat unceasingly upon the earth from
outer space cast forth by the huge gener-
ators of the stars and it has also been known
that they must have some great effect in one
way or another upon the life of the earth
i have proved that they do have such an
effect and that that effect is what we call
evolution for it is the cosmic rays beat-
ing upon every living organism on earth
that cause the profound changes in the
structure of those organisms which we call
mutations those changes are slow indeed
but it is due to them that through the ages
life has been raised from the first proto-
plasm to man and is still being raised
higher

	 ood lord you cant be serious on
vjthis pollard dutton protested

i am so serious that i am going to stake
my life on my discovery tonight pollard
answered quietly

we were startled what do you mean
i mean that i have found in the cosmic
rays the cause of evolution the answer to
the first question and that tonight by means
of them i am going to answer the second
question and find out what the future evolu-
tionary development of man will be

but how could you possibly-

pollard interrupted easily enough i
have been able in the last months to do
something no physicist has been able to do


wonder stories

to concentrate the cosmic rays and yet re-
move from them their harmful properties
you saw the cylinder over the metal cube
in my laboratory that cylinder literally
gathers in for an immense distance the cos-
mic rays that strike this part of earth and
reflects them down inside the cube

now suppose those concentrated cosmic
rays millions of times stronger than the
ordinary cosmic rays that strike one spot on
earth fall upon a man standing inside the
cube what will be the result it is the
cosmic rays that cause evolutionary change
and you heard me say that they are still
changing all life on earth still changing
man but so slowly as to be unnoticeable
but what about the man under those terrifi-
cally intensified rays  he will be changed
millions of times faster than ordinarily will
go forward in hours or minutes through the
evolutionary mutations that all mankind
will go forward through in eons to come
and you propose to try that experi-
ment i cried

i propose to try it on myself said pol-
lard gravely and to find out for myself the
evolutionary changes that await human-
kind

why its insane dutton exclaimed
pollard smiled the old cry he com-
mented never an attempt has been made
yet to tamper with natures laws but that
cry has been raised

but duttons right i cried pollard
youve worked here alone too long-youve
let your mind become warped-

you are trying to tell me that i have
become a little mad he said no i am
sane-perhaps wonderfully sane in trying
this

his expression changed his eyes brooding
cant you two see what this may mean to
humanity as we are to the apes so must
the men of the future be to us if we could
use this method of mine to take all mankind
forward through millions of years of evolu-
tionary development at one stride wouldnt
it be sane to do so

my mind was whirling good heavens
the whole thing is so crazy i protested
to accelerate the evolution of the human

race it seems somehow a thing forbid-
den

its a thing glorious if it can be done
he returned and i know that it can be
done but first one must go ahead must
travel on through stage after stage of mans
future development to find out to which
stage it would be most desirable for all
mankind to be transferred i know there
is such an age

and you asked us up here to take part
in that

just that i mean to enter the cube and
let the concentrated rays whirl me forward
along the paths of evolution but i must
have someone to turn the rays on and off at
the right moments

its all incredible dutton exclaimed
pollard if this is a joke its gone far
enough for me

for answer pollard rose we will go
to the laboratory now he said simply i
am eager to get started

i cannot remember following pollard and
dutton to the laboratory my thoughts were
spinning so at the time it was not until
we stood before the great cube from which
the huge metal cylinder towered that i was
aware of the reality of it all

pollard had gone into the dynamo-room
and as dutton and i stared wordlessly at
the great cube and cylinder at the retorts
and flasks of acids and strange equipment
about us we heard the hum of motor-gen-
erators pollard came back to the switch-
board supported in a steel frame beside the
cube and as he closed a switch there there
came a crackling and the cylinder glowed
with white light

pollard pointed to it and the big quartz-
like disc in the cubical chambers ceiling
from which the white force-shafts shot down-
ward

the cylinder is now gathering cosmic
rays from an immense area of space he
said and those-concentrated rays are fall-
ing through that disk into the cubes inter-
ior to cut off the rays it is necessary only
to open this switch he reached to open
the switch the light died
the man who evolved



the man who evolved

quickly while we stared he removed
his clothing donning in place of it a
loose white running suit

i will want to observe the changes of my
own body as much as possible he explain-
ed now i will stand inside the cube
and you will turn on the rays and let them
play upon me for fifteen minutes rough-
ly that should represent a period of some
fifty million years of future evolutionary
change at the end of fifteen minutes you
will turn the rays off and we will be able to
observe what changes they have caused we
will then resume the process going for-
ward by fifteen-minute or rather fifty million
year periods

but where will it stop-where will we
quit the process dutton asked

pollard shrugged well stop where
evolution stops that is where the rays no
longer affect me you know biologists have
often wondered what the last change or
final development of man will be the lasta
mutation well we are going to see tonight
what it will be

he stepped toward the cube and then paus-
ed went to a desk and brought from it a
sealed envelope he handed to me

this is just in case something happens
to me of a fatal nature he said it con-
tains an attestation signed by myself that
you two are in no way responsible for what
i am undertaking

pollard give up this unholy business

i cried clutching his arm its not too
late and this whole thing seems ghastly to
me

im afraid it is too late he smiled if
i backed out now id be ashamed to look in
a mirror hereafter and no explorer was
ever more eager than i am to start down
the path of mans future evolution

he stepped up into the cube standing
directly beneath the disk in its ceiling he
motioned imperatively and like an automa-
ton i closed the door and then threw the
switch

the cylinder broke again into glowing
white light and as the shafts of glowing
white force shot down from the disk in the

cubes ceiling upon pollard we glimpsed
his whole body writhing as though beneath
a terrifically concentrated electrical force
the shaft of glowing emanation almost hid
him from our view i knew that the cosmic
rays in themselves were invisible but
guessed that the light of the cylinder and
shaft was in some way a transformation of
part of the rays into visible light

dutton and i stared with beating hearts
into the cubical chamber having but fleet-
ing glimpses of pollards form my watch
was in one hand the other hand on the
switch the fifteen minutes that followed
seemed to me to pass with the slowness of
fifteen eternities neither of us spoke and
the only sounds were the hum of the gener-
ators and the crackling of the cylinder that
from the far spaces was gathering and con-
centrating the rays of evolution

at last the watchs hand marked the quar-
ter-hour and i snapped off the switch the
light of the cylinder and inside the cube
dying exclamations burst from us both

pollard stood inside the cube staggering
as though still dazed by the impact of the
experience but he was not the pollard who
had entered the chamber he was trans-
figured godlike his body had literally ex-
panded into a great figure of such physical
power and beauty as we had not imagined
could exist he was many inches taller and
broader his skin a clear pink every limb
and muscle molded as though by some mas-
ter sculptor

the greatest change though was in his
face  pollards homely good-humored
features were gone replaced by a face
whose pprfectly-cut features held the stamp
of immense intellectual power that shone
almost overpoweringly from the clear dark
eyes it was not pollard who stood before
us i told myself but a being as far above
us as the most advanced man of today is
above the troglodyte

he was stepping out of the cube and his
voice reached our ears clear and bell-like
triumphant

you see it worked as i knew it would
work im fifty million years ahead of the
rest of humanity in evolutionary develop-
ment


wonder stories

pollard my lips moved with dif-
ficulty pollard this is terrible-this
change-

his radiant eyes flashed terrible its
wonderful do you two realize what i now
am can you realize it this body of mine
is the kind of body all men will have in
fifty million years and the brain inside it
is a brain fifty million years ahead of yours
in development

he swept his hand about why all
this laboratory and former work of
mine seems infinitely petty childish to me
the problems that i worked on for years i
could solve now in minutes i could do
more for mankind now than all the men
now living could do together

then youre going to stop at this stage
dutton cried eagerly youre not going
further with this

of course i am if fifty million years
development makes this much change in
man what will a hundred million years two
hundred million make im going to find
that out

i grasped his hand pollard listen to
me your experiment has succeeded has
fulfilled your wildest dreams stop it now
think what you can accomplish man i
know your ambition has always been to be
orte of humanitys great benefactors-by
stopping here you can be the greatest you
can be a living proof to mankind of what
your process can make it and with that
proof before it all humanity will be eager to
become the same as you

he freed himself from my grasp no
arthur-i have gone part of the way into
humanitys future and im going on

he stepped back into the chamber while
dutton and i stared helplessly it seemed
half a dream the laboratory the cubical
chamber the godlike figure inside that was
and still was not pollard

turn on the rays and let them play for
fifteen minutes more he was directing
it will project me ahead another fifty mil-
lion years

his eyes and voice were imperative and
i glanced at my watch and snicked over the

switch again the cylinder broke into
light again the shaft of force shot down
into the cube to hide pollards splendid fig-
ure

dutton and i waited with feverish inten-
sity in the next minutes pollard was
standing still beneath the broad shaft of
force and so was hidden in it from our
eyes what would its lifting disclose
would he have changed still more into some
giant form or would he be the same hav-
ing already reached humanitys highest pos-
sible development

when i shut off the mechanism at the
end of the appointed period dutton and i
received a shock for again pollard had
changed

he was no longer the radiant physically
perfect figure of the first metamorphosis
his body instead seemed to have grown thin
and shrivelled the outlines of bones visible
through its flesh his body indeed seem-
ed to have lost half its bulk and many inches
of stature and breadth but these were com-
pensated for by the change in his head

for the head supported by this weak body
was an immense bulging balloon that meas-
ured fully eighteen inches from brow to
back it was almost entirely hairless its
great mass balanced precariously upon his
slender shoulders and neck and his face
too was changed greatly the eyes larger and
the mouth smaller the ears seeming smaller
also the great bulging forehead domina-
ted the face

could this be pollard his voice sound-
ed thin and weak to our ears

you are surprised to see me this time
well you see a man a hundred million years
ahead of you in development and i must
confess that you appear to me as two bru-
tish hairy cave-men would appear to you

but pollard this is awful dutton
cried this change is more terrible than
the first  if you had only stopped at
the first 

the eyes of the shrivelled huge-headed
figure in the cube fired with anger stop
at that first stage im glad now that i
didnt the man i was fifteen minutes
ago    fifty million years ago in devel-
opment    seems now to me to have been
the man who evolved



half-animal what was his big animal-like
body beside my immense brain

you say that because in this change
youre getting away from all human emo-
tions and sentiments i burst pollard
do you realize what youre doing youre
changing out of human semblance

i realize it perfectly he snapped and
i see nothing to bedeplored in the fact it
means that in a hundred million years man
will be developing in brain-capacity and
will care nothing for the development of
body to you two crude beings of what
is to me the past this seems terrible but
to me it is desirable and natural turn on
the rays again

dont do it art cried dutton this
madness has gone far enough 

pollards great eyes surveyed us with cold
menace you will turn on the rays his
thin voice ordered deliberately if you
do not it will be but the work of a moment
for me to annihilate both of you and go on
with this alone

youd kill us i said dumfoundedly
we two two of your best friends

his narrow mouth seemed to sneer
friends i am millions of years past such
irrational emotions as friendship the
only emotion you awaken in me is a con-
tempt for your crudity turn on the rays

the brain monster

his eyes blazed as he snapped the last
order and as though propelled by a
force outside myself i closed the switch
the shaft of glowing force again hid him
from our view

of our thoughts during the following
quarter-hour i can say nothing for both
dutton and i were so rigid with awe and
horror as to make our minds chaotic i
shall never forget though that first moment
after the time had passed and i had again
switched off the mechanism

the change had continued and pollard-
i could not call him that in my own mind-
stood in the cube-chamber as a shape the
sight of which stunned our minds

he had become simply a great head a
huge hairless head fully a yard in diameter

supported on tiny legs the arms having
dwindled to mere hands that projected just
below the head the eyes were enormous
saucer-like but the ears were mere pin-holes
at either side of the head the nose and
mouth being similar holes below the eyes

he was stepping out of the chamber on
his ridiculously little limbs and as dutton
and i reeled back in unreasoning horror his
voice came to us as an almost inaudible
piping and it held pride

you tried to keep me from going on and
you see what i have become to such as
you no doubt i seem terrible yet you two
and all like you seem as low to me as the
worms that crawl

good god pollard youve made yourself
a monster the words burst from me
without thought

his enormous eyes turned on me you
call me pollard yet i am no more the pol-
lard you knew and who entered that cham-
ber first than you are the ape of millions of
years ago from whom you sprang and all
mankind is like you two well they will
all learn the powers of one who is a hun-
dred and fifty million years in advance of
them 

what do you mean dutton exclaimed
i mean that with the colossal brain i
have i will master without a struggle this
man-swarming planet and make it a huge
laboratory in which to pursue the experi-
ments that please me

but pollard-remember why you started
this i cried to go ahead and chart the
path of future evolution for humanity-to
benefit humanity and not to rule it

the great heads enormous eyes did not
change i remember that the creature pol-
lard that i was until tonight had such foolish
ambitions yes it would stir mirth now
if i could feel such an emotion to bene-
fit humanity do you men dream of bene-
fitting the animals you rule over i would
no sooner think of working for the benefit
of you humans

do you two yet realize that i am so far
ahead of you in brain power now as you are
ahead of the beasts that perish look at

of the laboratory tables was reaching
among the retorts and apparatus there
swiftly he poured several compounds into a
lead mortar added others poured upon the
mixed contents another mixture made as
swiftly

there was a puff of intense green smoke
from the mortar instantly and then the
great head-i can only call him that-turned
the mortar upside down a lump of shin-
ing mottled metal fell out and we gasped as
we recognized the yellow sheen of pure gold
made in a moment apparently by a mixture
of common compounds

you see the grotesque figure was ask-
ing what is the transformation of ele-
ments to a mind like mine you two can-
not even realize the scope of my intelli-
gence 

i can destroy all life on this earth from
this room if i desire i can construct a
telescope that will allow me to look on the
planets of the farthest galaxies i can send
my mind forth to make contact with other
minds without the slightest material con-
nection and you think it terrible that i
should rule your race i will not rule
them i will own them and this planet as
you might own a farm and animals

you couldnt i cried pollard if
there is anything of pollard left in you give
up that thought well kill you ourselves
before well let you start a monstrous rule
of men

we will-by god we will dutton
cried his face twitching

we had started desperately forward tow-
ard the great head but stopped suddenly in
our tracks as his great eyes met ours i
found myself walking backward to where i
had stood walking back and dutton with
me like two automatons

so you two would try to-kill me
queried the head that had been pollard
why i could direct you without a word to
kill yourselves and youd do so in an in-
stant what chance has your puny will
and brain against mine and what chance
will all the force of men have against me
when a glance from me will make them
puppets of my will

desperate inspiration flashed
through my brain pollard wait
i exclaimed you were going on with the
process with the rays if you stop here
youll not know what changes lie beyond
your present form

he seemed to consider that is true
he admitted and though it seems impossi-
ble to me that by going on i can attain to
greater intelligence than i now have i want
to find out for certain

then youll go under the rays for an-
other fifteen minutes i asked quickly

i will he answered but lest you har-
bor any foolish ideas you may know that
even inside the chamber i will be able to
lead your thoughts and can kill both of you
before you can make a move to harm me
he stepped up into the chamber again
and as i reached for the switch dutton
trembling beside me we glimpsed for a mo-
ment the huge head before the down-smiting
white force hid it from our sight

the minutes of this period seemed drag-
ging even more slowly than before it
seemed hours before i reached at last to
snap off the rays we gazed into the cham-
ber shaking

at first glance the great head inside
seemed unchanged but then we saw that it
had changed and greatly instead of be-
ing a skin-covered head with at least rudi-
mentary arms and legs it was now a great
gray head-like shape of even greater size
supported by two gray muscular tentacles
the surface of this gray head-thing was
wrinkled and folded and its only features
were two eyes as small as our own

oh my god quaked dutton hes
changing from a head into a brain-hes los-
ing all human appearance

into our minds came a thought from the
gray head-thing before us a thought as
clear as though spoken you have guessed
it for even my former head-body is disap-
pearing all atrophying except the brain i
am become a walking seeing brain as i
am so all of your race will be in two hun-
dred million years gradually losing more
and more of their atrophied bodies and de-
veloping more and more their great brains
his eyes seemed to read us you need
the man who evolved



not fear now the things i threatened in my
last stage of development my mind grown
infinitely greater would no more now want
to rule you men and your little planet than
you would want to rule an anthill and its
inhabitants my mind gone fifty million
years further ahead in development can
soar out now to vistas of power and know-
ledge unimagined by me in that last stage
and unimaginable to you

great god pollard i cried what
have you become

pollard dutton was laughing hysteri-
cally you call that thing pollard why
we had dinner with pollard three hours ago
-he was a human being and not a thing
like this

 have become what all men will be-
come in time the things thought answered
me i have gone this far along the road of
mans future evolution and am going on to
the end of that road am going to attain the
development that the last mutation possible
will give me

turn on the rays his thought continued
i think that i must be approaching now the
last possible mutation

i snapped over the switch again and the
white shaft of the concentrated rays veiled
from us the great gray shape i felt my
own mind giving beneath the strain of hor-
ror of the last hour and dutton was still
half-hysterical

the humming and crackling of the great
apparatus seemed thunderous to my ears as
the minutes passed with every nerve keyed
to highest tension i threw open the switch
at last the rays ceased and the figure in
the chamber was again revealed

dutton began to laugh shrilly and then
abruptly was sobbing i do not know
whether i was doing the same though i have
a dim memory of mouthing incoherent
things as my eyes took in the shape in the
chamber

it was a great brain a gray limp mass
four feet across it lay in the chamber its
surface ridged and wrinkled by innumerable
fine convolutions it had no features or
limbs of any kind in its gray mass it was
simply a huge brain whose only visible sign
of life was its slow twitching movement

from it thoughts beat strongly into our
own horror-weighted brains

you see me now a great brain only just
as all men will be far in the future yes
you might have known i might have known
when i was like you that this would be the
course of human evolution that the brain
that alone gives man dominance would de-
velop and the body that hampers that brain
would atrophy until he would have develop-
ed into pure brain as i now am

i have no features no senses that i could
describe to you yet i can realize the uni-
verse infinitely better than you can with
your elementary senses i am aware of
planes of existence you cannot imagine i
can feed myself with pure energy without
the need of a cumbersome body to trans-
form it and i can move and act despite my
lack of limbs by means and with a speed and
power utterly beyond your comprehension

if you still have fear of the threats i
made two stages back against your world
and race banish them i am pure intelli-
gence now and as such though i can no
more feel the emotions of love or friendship
neither can i feel those of ambition or pride
the only emotion if such it is that remains
to me still is intellectual curiosity and this
desire for truth that has burned in man since
his apehood will thus be the last of all de-
sires to leave him

the last mutation

 a brain-a great brain dutton
jljl was saying dazedly here in pol-
lards laboratory-but wheres pollard he
was here too 

then all men will some day be as you
are now i cried

yes came the answering thought in
two hundred and fifty million years man as
you know him and as you are will be no
more and after passing all the stages
through which i have passed through to-
night the human race will have developed
into great brains inhabiting not only your
solar system no doubt but the systems of
other stars

and thats the end of mans evolutionary


wonder stories

road that is the highest point that he
will reach

no i think he will change still from
those great brains into still a higher form
the brain answered-the brain that three
hours before had been pollard-and i am
going to find out now what that higher form
will be for i think this will be the last
mutation of all and that with it i will reach
the end of mans evolutionary path the last
and highest form into which he can devel-
op

you will turn on the rays now the
brains order continued and in fifteen
minutes we will know what that last and
highest form is

my hand was on the switch but dutton
had staggered to me was clutching ray arm
dont arthur he was exclaiming thick-
ly weve seen horrors enough-lets not
see the last-get out of here 

i cant i cried oh god i want to
stop but i cant now-i want to see the end
myself-ive got to see   

turn on the rays came the brains
thought-order again

the end of the road-the last mutation
i panted weve got to see-to see- i
drove the switch home

the rays flashed down again to hide the
great gray brain in the cube duttons eyes
were staring fixedly he was clinging to me

the minutes passed each tick of the
watch in my hand was the mighty note of a
great tolling bell in my ears

an inability to move seemed gripping me
the hand of my watch was approaching the
minrite for which i waited yet i could not
raise my hand toward the switch

then as the hand reached the appointed
minute i broke from my immobility and in
a sheer frenzy of sudden strength pulled
open the switch rushed forward with dut-
ton to the cubes very edge

the great gray brain that had been inside
it was gone there lay on the cubes floor
instead of it a quite shapeless mass of clear
jelly-like matter it was quite motionless
save for a slight quivering my shaking
hand went forth to touch it and then it was
that i screamed such a scream as all the

tortures of hells crudest fiends could not
have wrung from a human throat

the mass inside the cube was a mass of
simple protoplasm this then was the end
of mans evolution-road the highest form
to which time would bring him the last mu-
tation of all the road of mans evolution
was a circular one returning to its begin-
ning

from the earths bosom had risen the first
crude organisms then sea-creature and
land-creature and mammal and ape to man
and from man it would rise in the future
through all the forms we had seen that night
there would be super-men bodiless heads
pure brains only to be changed by the last
mutation of all into the protoplasm from
which first it had sprung

i do not know now exactly what follow-
ed i know that i rushed upon that quiver-
ing quiescent mass calling pollards name
madly and shouting things i am glad i can-
not remember i know that dutton was
shouting too with insane laughter and that
as he struck with lunatic howls and fury
about the laboratory the crash of breaking
glass and the hiss of escaping gases was in
my ears and then from those mingling
acids bright flames were leaping and spread-
ing sudden fires that alone i think now
saved my own sanity

for i can remember dragging the insane-
ly laughing dutton from the room from the
house into the cool darkness of the night
i remember the chill of dew-wet grass
against my hands and face as the flames
from pollards house soared higher and
i remember that as i saw duttons crazy
laughter by that crimson light i knew that
he would laugh thus until he died

  

so ends my narrative of the end that came
to pollard and pollards house it is as i
said in beginning a narrative that i only
can tell now for dutton has never spoken
a sane word since in the institution where
he now is they think his condition the re-
sult of shock from the fire just as pollard
was believed to have perished in that fire
i have never until now told the truth

but i am telling it now hoping that it
will in some way lessen the horror it has
the man who evolved



left with me for there could be no horror
greater than that we saw in pollards house
that night i have brooded upon it with
my minds eye i have followed that tremen-
dous cycle of change that purposeless eon-
long climb of life up from simple proto-
plasm through myriads of forms and lives
of ceaseless pain and struggle only to end
in simple protoplasm again

will that cycle of evolutionary change be
repeated over and over again upon this and
other worlds ceaselessly purposelessly un-
til there is no more universe for it to go on
in is this colossal cycle of lifes changes

as inevitable and necessary as the cycle that
in space makes of the nebulae myriad suns
and of the suns dark-stars and of the dark-
stars colliding with one another nebula
again

or is this evolutionary cycle we saw a
cycle in appearance only is there some
change that we cannot understand above and
beyond it i do not know which of these
possibilities is truth but i do know that the
first of them haunts me it would haunt the
world if the world believed my story per-
haps i should be thankful as i write to know
that i will not be believed

the conquest of gola

by leslie f stone

hola my daughters sighed the mat-
riarch it is true indeed i am the only
living one upon gola who remembers the in-
vasion from detaxal i alone of all my gen-
eration survive to recall vividly the sights
and scenes of that past era and well it is
that you come to me to hear by free commun-
ication of mind to mind face to face with
each other

ah well i remember the surprise of that
hour when through the mists that enshroud
our lovely world there swam the first of the
great smooth cylinders of the detaxalans
fifty tas in length as glistening and sil-
very as the soil of our land propelled by
the man-things that on detaxal are supreme

since there is no means of translating the golan
measurements of either length or time wo can but
guess at these things however since the detaxalan
ships each carried a thousand men it can be seen that
the ships were between five hundred and a thousand
feet in length

even as we women are supreme on gola

in those bygone days as now gola was
enwrapped by her cloud mists that keep from
us the terrific glare of the great star that
glows like a malignant spirit out there in
the darkness of the void only occasionally
when a particularly great storm parts the
mist of heaven do we see the wonders of the
vast universe but that does not prevent us
with our marvelous telescopes handed down
to us from thousands of generations before
us from learning what lies across the dark
seas of the outside

therefore we knew of the nine planets
that encircle the great star and are subject
its rule and so are we familiar enough
with the surfaces of these planets to know
why gola should appear as a haven to their
inhabitants who see in our cloud-enclosed
mantle a sweet release from the blasting heat


how
the
strange
people
of
gola
repelled
the
barbarians
who came
to

conquer



we were astounded by what we saw geble interested herself
only in the men standing rigidly where our beam had caught them

and blinding glare of the great sun

so it was not strange at all to us to find
that the people of detaxal the third planet
of the sun had arrived on our globe with a
wish in their hearts to migrate here and
end their days out of reach of the blistering
warmth that had come to be their lot on
their own world

long ago we too might have gone on ex-
ploring expeditions to other worlds other
universes but for what are we not happy
here we who have attained the greatest of
civilizations within the confines of our own
silvery world powerfully strong with our
mighty force rays we could subjugate all
the universe but why

are we not content with life as it is with

our lovely cities our homes our daughters
our gentle consorts why spend physical
eneigy in combative strife for something
we do not wish when our mental processes
carry us further and beyond the conquest
of mere terrestrial exploitation

on detaxal it i different for there the
peoples the ignoble male creatures breed
for physical prowess leaving the develop-
ment of their sciences their philosophies
and the contemplation of the abstract to a
chosen few the greater part of the race
fares forth to conquer to lay waste to strug-
gle and fight as the animals do over a morsel
of worthless territory of course we can
see why they desired gola with all its treas-
ures but we can thank providence and our-




wonder stories

selves that they did not succeed in commer-
cializing us as they have the remainder of
the universe with their ignoble federation

ah yes well i recall the hour when first
they came pushing cautiously through
the cloud mists seeking that which lay be-
neath we of gola
were unwarned until
the two cylinders hung
directly above tola
the greatest city of that
time which still lies in
its ruins since that me-
morial day but they
have paid for it-paid
for it well in thousands
and in tens of thou-
sands of their men

we were first ap-
prised of their coming
when the alarm from
tola was sent from the
great beam station
there advising all to
stand in readiness for
an emergency geble
my mother was then
queen of all gola and
i was by her side in
morka that pleasant
seaside resort where i
shall soon travel again
to partake of its re-
juvenating waters

with us were four of
gebles consorts sweet
gentle males that gave
geble much pleasure
these free hours

m

away from the worries
of state but when the
word of the strangers
descent over our home

city tola came to us all else was forgotten
with me at her side geble hastened to the
beam station and there in the matter trans-
mitter we dispatched our physical beings to
the palace at tola and the next moment
were staring upward at the two strange
shapes etched against the clouds

what the detaxalan ships were waiting for

americans are fond
rof ridiculing the cus-
toms habits and tempera-
ments of people of other
nations similarly other
nations pick our peculiari-
ties as a source of amuse-
ment we all think that
what we do think or say is
natural and inevitable and
that the actions of others
are queer

similarly if we were to
travel to a strange world
and find different forms of
intelligent life we would
be monstrosities to those
people as much as they
would be to us we would
find it more difficult than
we imagine to even estab-
lish the most elementary
form of communication be-
cause our mental processes
would have practically
nothing in common that
is all assuming that our
mission is friendly but if
it is hostile there is no
doubt but that our career
on that strange world
would be as our author
shows here short and
sweet here is a different
and unusual story that you
cannot help but enjoy and
chuckle over

we did not know then but later we learned
not grasping the meaning of our beam sta-
tions the commandants of the ships consid-
ered the city below them entirely lacking in
means of defense and were conferring on the
method of taking it without bloodshed on
either side

it was not long after
v our arrival in tola that
the first of the ships
began to descend tow-
ard the great square
before the palace
geble watched without
a word her great mind
already scanning the
brains of those whom
she found within the
great machine she
transferred to my mind
but a single thought as
i stood there at her
side and that with a
sneer barbarians
now the ship was
settling in the square
and after a few mo-
ments of hesitation a
circular doorway ap-
peared at the side and
four of the detaxalans
came through the op-
ening the square
was empty but for
themselves and their
flyer and we saw them
looking about survey-
ing the beautiful build-
ings on all sides they
seemed to recognize the
palace for what it was
and in one accord
moved in our direction
then geble left the
window at which we stood and strode to the
doorway opening upon the balcony that
faced the square the detaxalans halted in
their tracks when they saw her slender grace-
ful form appear and removing the strange
coverings they wore on their heads they each
made a bow

again geble sneered for only the male-
the conquest of gola



things of our world bow their heads and so
she recognized these visitors for what they
were nothing more than the despicable males
of the species and what creatures they
were

imagine a short almost flat body set high
upon two slender legs the body tapering
in the middle several times as broad across
as it is through the center with twct arms
almost as long as the legs attached to the
upper part of the torso a small column-
like neck of only a few inches divides the
head of oval shape from the body and in
this head only are set the organs of sight
hearing and scent their bodies were like
a patch work of a misguided nature

yes strange as it is
my daughters practically
all of the creatures fac-
ulties had their base in
the small ungainly head
and each organ was per-
force pressed into serving
for several functions for
instance the breathing
nostrils also served for
scenting out odors nor
was this organ able to ex-
clude any disagreeable
odors that might come its
way but had to dispense
to the brain both pleasant
and unpleasant odors at
the same time

then there was the
mouth set directlybe-
neath the nose and here again we had an
example of one organ doing the work of two
for the creature not only used the mouth
with which to take in the food for its body
but it also used the mouth to enunciate the
excruciatingly ugly sounds of its language
forthwith

guests from detaxal

never before have i seen such a poorly
organized body so unlike our own
highly developed organisms how much
nicer it is to be able to call forth any organ
at will and dispense with it when its useful-
ness is over instead these poor detaxalans

had to carry theirs about in physical being
all the time-so that always was the surface
of their bodies entirely marred

yet that was not the only part of their
ugliness and proof of the lowliness of their
origin for whereas our fine bodies support
themselves by muscular development these
poor creatures were dependent entirely upon
a strange structure to keep them in their pro-
per shape

imagine if you can a bony skeleton some-
what like the foundations upon which we
build our edifices laying stone and cement
over the steel framework but this skeleton
instead is inside a body which the flesh
muscle and skin overlay everywhere in
their bodies are these
cartilaginous structures-
hard heavy bony struc-
tures developed by the
chemicals of the being for
its use even the hands
feet and head of the crea-
tures were underlaid with
these bones ugh it was
terrible when we dissected
-one of the fellows for
study i shudder t o
think of it

yet again there was
stil another feature of
the detaxalans that was
equally as horrifying as
the rest namely their out-
er covering as we view-
ed them for the first time
out there in the square we discovered that
parts of the body that is the part of the head
which they called the face and the bony
hands were entirely naked without any sort
of covering neither fur nor feathers just the
raw pinkish-brown skin looking as if it
had been recently plucked

later we found a few specimens that had
a type of fur on the lower part of the face
but these were rare and when they doffed
the head coverings which we had first taken
for some sort of natural covering we saw
that the top of the head was overlaid with
a very fine fuzz of fur several inches long

we did not know in the beginning that
the strange covering on the bodies cjf the

leslie f stone


wonder stories

lour men green in color was not a natural
growth but later discovered that such was
the truth and not only the face and hands
were bare of fur but the entire body except
for a fine sprinkling of hair that was scarce-
ly visible except on the chest was also bare
no wonder the poor things covered them-
selves with their awkward clothing we ar-
rived at the conclusion that their lack of fur
had been brought about by the fact that al-
ways they had been exposed to the bright
rays of the sun so that without the dampness
of our own planet the fur had dried up and
fallen away from the flesh

now thinking it over i suppose that we
of gola presented strange form to the peo-
ple of detaxal with our fine circular bodies
rounded at the top our short beautiful lower
limbs with the circular foot pads and our
short round arms and hand pads flexible
and muscularlike rubber

but how envious they must have been
of our beautiful golden coats our movable
eyes our power to scent hear and touch
with any part of the body to absorb food
and drink through any part of the body most
convenient to us at any time oh yes laugh
though you may without a doubt we were
also freaks to those freakish detaxalans but
no matter let us return to the tale

on recognizing our visitors for what they
were simple-minded males geble was chag-
rined at them for taking up her time but
they were strangers to our world and we
golans are always courteous geble began
of course to try to communicate by thought
transference but strangely enough the fel-
lows below did not catch a single thought
instead entirely unaware of gebles overture
to friendship the leader commenced to
speak to her in most outlandish manner con-
torting the red lips of his mouth into various
uncouth shapes and making sounds that fell
upon our hearing so unpleasantly that we
immediately closed our senses to them and
without a word geble turned her back upon
them calling for tanka her personal secre-
tary

tanka was instructed to welcome the
detaxalans while she herself turned to
her own chambers to summon a half dozen of

her council when the council arrived she
began to discuss with them the problem of
extracting more of the precious tenix from
the waters of the great inland lake of
notauch nothing whatever was said of the
advent of the detaxalans for geble had dis-
missed them from her mind as creatures not
worthy of her thought

in the meantime tanka had gone forth to
meet the four who of course could not con-
verse with her in accordance with the
queens orders she led them indoors to the
most informal receiving chamber and there
had them served with food and drink which
by the looks of the remains in the dishes
they did not relish at all

leading them through the rooms of the
lower floor of the palace she made a pre-
tence of showing them everything which
they duly surveyed but they appeared to
chafe at the manner in which they were be-
ing entertained

the creatures even made an attempt
through the primitive method of conversing
by their arms to learn something of what
they had seen but tanka was as supercilious
as her mistress when she thought they
had had enough she led them to the square
and back to the door of their flyer giving
them their dismissal

but the men were not ready to accept it
instead they tried to express to tanka their
desire to meet the ruling head of gola al-
though their hand motions were perfectly
inane and incomprehensible tanka could
read what passed through their brains and
understood more fully than they what lay
in their minds she shook her head and
motioned that they were to embark in their
flyer and be on their way back to their
planet

again and again the detaxalans tried to
explain what they wished thinking tanka
did not understand at last she impressed
upon their savage minds that there was noth-
ing for them but to depart and disgruntled
by her treatment they reentered their ma-
chine closed its ponderous door and raised
their ship to the level of its sister flyer sev-
eral minutes passed and then with thanks-
giving we saw them pass over the city

told of this geble laughed to think of

think that we can find use for them she
wanted to know

it is strange indeed observed yabo
one of the council members what did
you find in the minds of these ignoble crea-
tures o august one

nothing of particular interest a very
low grade of intelligence to be sure there
was no need of looking below the surface
it must have taken intelligence to build
those ships

none aboard them did that i dont
question it but that their mothers built the
ships for them as a playthings even as we
give toys to our little ones you know i
recall that the ancients of our world per-
fected several types of space-flyers many
ages ago

maybe those males do not have
mothers but instead they build the ships
themselves maybe they are the stronger sex
on their world this last was said by
suiki the fifth consort of geble a pretty
little male rather young in years no one
had noticed his coming into the chamber
but now everyone showed their surprise at
his words

impossible ejaculated yabo

geble however laughed at the little chaps
expression suiki is a profound thinker
she observed still laughing and she drew
him to her gently hugging him

a nice business deal

and with that the subject of the men
from detaxal was closed it was reopen-
ed however several hours later when it was
learned that instead of leaving gola alto-
gether the ships were seen one after another
by the various cities of the planet as they
circumnavigated it

it was rather annoying for everywhere
the cities routines were broken up as the
people dropped their work arid studies to
gaze at the cylinders too it was upsetting
the morale of the males for on learning

that the two ships contained only creatures
of their own sex they were becoming en-
vious wishing for the same type of play-
things for themselves

shut in as they are unable to grasp the
profundities of our science and thought the
gentle fun-loving males were always glad
for a new diversion and this new method
developed by the detaxalans had intrigued
them

it was then that geble decided it high
time to take matters into her own hands
not knowing where the two ships were at
the moment it was not difficult with the ob-
ject-finder beam to discover their where-
abouts and then with the attractor to draw
them to tola magnetically an ous later
wc had the pleasure of seeing the two ships
rushing toward our city when they ar-
rived about it power brought them down to
the square again

again tanka was sent out and directed
the commanders of the two ships to follow
her in to the queen knowing the futility
of attempting to converse with them without
mechanical aid geble caused to be brought
her three of the ancient mechanical thought
transformers that are only museum pieces
t us but still workable the two men were
directed to place them on their heads while
she donned the third when this was done
she ordered the creatures to depart immed-
iately from gola telling them that she was
tired of their play

watching the faces of the two i saw them
frowning and shaking their heads of course
i could read their thoughts as well as geble
without need of the transformers since it
was only for their benefit that these were
used so i heard the whole conversation
though i need only to give you the gist of
it

we have no wish to leave your world as
yet the two had argued

you are disrupting the routine of our
lives here geble told them and now that
youve seen all that you can there is no
need for you to stay longer i insist that you
leave immediately

i saw one of the men smile and thereupon
he was the one who did all the talking i


wonder stories

say talking for this he was actually doing
mouthing eaoh one of his words although
we understood his thoughts as they formed
in his queer brain so different from ours

listen here he laughed i dont get the
hang of you people at all we came to
gola he used some outlandish name of his
own but i use our name of course with
the express purpose of exploration and ex-
ploitation we come as friends already
we are in alliance with damin again the
name for the fourth planet of our system
was different but i give the correct appela-
tion established commerce and trade and
now we are ready to offer you the chance to
join our federation peaceably

what we have seen of this world is very
favorable there are good prospects for busi-
ness here there is no reason why you
people as those of damin and detaxal can
not enter into a nice business arrangement
congenially you have far more here to
offer tourists more than damin why ex-
cept for your clouds this would be an ideal
paradise for every man woman and child
oil detaxal and damin to visit and of course
with our new cloud dispensers we could
clear your atmosphere for you in short order
and keep it that way why youll make mil-
lions in the first year of your trade

come now allow us to discuss this with
your ruler-king or whatever you call him
women are all right in their place but it
takes the men to see the profit of a thing
like this-er-you are a woman arent you

the first of his long speech of course
was so much gibberish to us with his
prate of business arrangements commerce
and trade tourists profits cloud dispensers
and what not but it was the last part of
what he said that took my breath away and
you can imagine how it affected geble i
could see straightway that she was intense-
ly angered and good reason too by the
looks of the silly fellows face i could guess
that he was getting the full purport of her
thoughts he began to shuffle his funny
feet and a foolish grin pervaded his face

sorry he said if i insulted you-i
didnt intend that but  believed that man
holds the same place here as he does on

detaxal and damin but i suppose it is just
as possible for woman to be the ruling fac-
tor of a world as man is elsewhere

that speech naturally made geble more
irate and tearing off her thought trans-
former she left the room without another
word in a moment however yabo ap-
peared wearing the transformer in her place
yabo had none of the beauty of my mother
for whereas geble was slender and as
straight as a rod yabo was obese anr her
fat body overflowed until she looked like a
large dumpy bundle of yat held together in
her furry skin she had very little dignity
as she waddled toward the detaxalans but
there was determination in her whole manner
and without preliminaries she began to scold
the two as though they were her own con-
sorts

there has been enough of this njy fine
young men she shot at them youve had
your fun and now it is time for you to return
tl your mothers and consorts shame on
you for making up such miserable tales
about yourselves i have a good mind to
take you home with me for a couple of days
and id put you in your places quick enough
the idea of men acting like you are

for a moment i thought the detaxalans
were going to cry by the faces they made
but instead they broke into laughter such
heathenish sounds as had never before been
heard on gola and i listened in wonder in-
stead of excluding it from my hearing but
the fellows sobered quickly enough at that
and the spokesman addressed the shocked
yabo

i see said he its impossible for your
people and mine to arrive at an understand-
ing peaceably im sorry that you take us
for children out on a spree that you are
accustomed to such a low type of men as is
evidently your lot here

i have given you your chance to accept
our terms without force but since you re-
fuse under the orders of the federation i
will have to take you forcibly for we are
determined that gola become one of us if
you like it or not then you will learn
that we are not the children you believe us
to be

you may go to your supercilious queen
the conquest of gola



now and advise her that we give you exactly
ten hours in which to evacuate this city for
precisely on the hour we will lay this city in
ruins and if that does not suffice you we
will do the same with every other city on
the planet remember ten hours

and with that he took the mechanical
thought transformer from his head and
tossed it on the table his companion did
the same and the two of them strode out of
the room and to their flyers which arose
several thousand feet above tola and re-
mained there

the triumph of gola

hurrying into geble yabo told her
what the detaxalan had said geble
was reclining on her couch and did not both-
er to raise herself

childish prattle she conceded and with-
drew her red eyes on their movable stems
into their pockets paying no more heed to
the threats of the men from detaxal

i however could not be as calm as my
mother and i was fearful that it was not
childish prattle after all not knowing
how long ten hours might be i did not wait
but crept up to the palaces beam station
and set its dials so that the entire building
and as much of the surrounding territory it
could cover were protected in the force zone

alas that the same beam was not greater
but it had not been put there for defense
only for matter transference and whatever
other peacetime methods we used it was
the means of proving just the same that it
was also a very good defensive instrument
for just two ous later the hovering ships
above let loose their powers of destruction
heavy explosives that entirely demolished
all of tola and its millions of people and
only the palace royal of all that beauty was
left standing

awakened from her nap by the terrific
detonation geble came hurriedly to a win-
dow to view the ruin and she was wild with
grief at what she saw geble however saw
that there was urgent need for action she
knew without my telling her what i had done
to protect the palace and though she
showed no sign of appreciation i knew that

 had won a greater place in her regard than
any other of her many daughters and would
henceforth be her favorite as well as her
successor as the case turned out

now with me behind her she hurried to
the beam station and in a twinkling we were
both in tubia the second greatest city of
that time nor were we to be caught nap-
ping again for geble ordered all beam sta-
tions to throw out their zone forces while
she herself manipulated one of tubias
greatest power beams attuning it to the
emanations of the two detaxalan flyers in
less than a ous the two ships were seen
through the mists heading for tubia for
a moment i grew fearful but on realizing
that they wpre after all in our grip and the
attractors held every living thing powerless
against movement i grew calm and watched
them come over the city and the beam pull
them to the ground	

with the beam still upon them they lay
supine on the ground without motion des-
cending to the square geble called for ray
c and when the machine arrived she herself
directed the cutting of the hole in the side
of the flyer and was the first to enter it with
me immediately behind as usual

we were both astounded by what we saw
of the great array of machinery within but
a glance told geble all she wanted to know
of their principles she interested herself
only in the men standing rigidly in what-
ever position our beam had caught them
only the eyes of the creatures expressed
their fright poor things unable to move so
much as a hair while we moved among them
untouched by the power of the beam because
of the strength of our own minds

they could have fought against it if they
had known how but their simple minds were
too weak for such exercise

now glancing about among the stiff forms
around us of which there were one thous-
and geble picked out those of the males
she desired for observation choosing those
she judged to be their finest specimens those
with much hair on their faces and having
more girth than the others these she or-
dered removed by several workers who fol-
lowed us and then we emerged again to the
outdoors


wonder stories

using hand beam torches the picked speci-
mens were kept immobile after they were
out of reach of the greater beam and were
borne into the laboratory of the building
geble had converted into her new palace
geble and i followed and she gave the or-
der for the complete annihilation of the two
powerless ships

thus ended the first foray of the people
of detaxal and for the next two tels
there was peace upon our globe again in
the laboratory the thirty who had been res-
cued from their ships were given thorough
examinations both physically and mentally
and we learned all there was to know about
them hearing of the destruction of their
ships most of the creatures had become
frightened and were quite docile in our
hands those that were unruly were used
in the dissecting room for the advancement
of golan knowledge

after a complete study of them which
yielded little we lost interest in them scienti-
fically geble however found some pleas-
ure in having the poor creatures around her
and kept three of them in her own chambers
so she could delve into their brains as she
pleased the others she doled out to her
favorites as she saw fit

one she gave to me to act as a slave or
in what capacity i desired him but my in-
terest in him soon waned especially since
i had now come of age and was allowed to
have two consorts of my own and go about
the business of bringing my daughters into
the world

my slave i called jon and gave him com-
plete freedom of my house if only we had
forseen what was coming we would have
annihilated every one of them immediately
it did please me later to find that jon was
learning our language and finding a place
in my household making friends with my
two shut-in consorts but as i have said i
paid little attention to him

so life went on smoothly with scarcely a
change after the destruction of the ships of
detaxal but that did not mean we were
unprepared for more geble reasoned that
there would be more ships forthcoming when
the detaxalans found that their first two did

not return so although it was sometimes
inconvenient the zones of force were kept
upon our cities

and geble was right for the day came
when dozens of flyers descended upon gola
from detaxal but this time the zones of
force did not hold them since the zones
were not in operation

and we were unwarned for when they
descended upon us our world was sleeping
confident that our zones were our protection
the first indication that i had of trouble
brewing was when awakening i found the
ugly form of jon bending over me sur-
prised for it was not his habit to arouse
me i started up only to find his arms about
me embracing me and how strong he
was for the moment a new emotion swept
me for the first time i knew the pleasure
to be had in the arms of a strong man but
that emotion was short lived for i saw in
the blue eyes of my slave that he had rec-
ognized the look in my eyes for what it was
and for the moment he was tender

later i was to grow angry when i thought
of that expression of his for his eyes filled
with pity pity for me but pity did not
stay instead he grinned and the next instant
he was binding me down to my couch with
strong rope geble i learned later had
been treated as i as were the members of
the council and every other woman in gola

that was what came of allowing our
men to meet on common ground with
the creatures from detaxal for a weak mind
is open to seeds of rebellion and the deta-
xalans had sown it well promising domin-
ance to the lesser creatures of gola

that however was only part of the plot
on the part of the detaxalans they were
determined not only to revenge those we
had murdered but also to gain mastery of
our planet unnoticed by us they had con-
structed a machine which transmits sound
as we transmit thought and by its means had
communicated with their own world advis-
ing them of the very hour to strike when all
of gola was slumbering it was a masterful
stroke only they did not know the power
of the mind of gola-so much more ancient
than theirs
the conquest of gola



lying there bound on my couch i was able
to see out the window and trembling with
terror i watched a half dozen detaxalan fly-
ers descend into tubia guessing that the
same was happening in our other cities i
was truly frightened for i did not have the
brain of a geble i was young yet and in
fear i watched the hordes march out of their
machines saw the thousands of our men
join them

free from restraint the shut-ins were hav-
ing their holiday and how they cavorted out
in the open most the time getting in the way
of the freakish detaxalans who were certain-
ly taking over our city

a half ous passed while i lay there watch-
ing waiting in fear at what the detaxalans
planned to do with us  remembered the
pleasant happy life we had led up to the
present and trembled over what the future
might be when the detaxalans had infested
us with commerce and trade business pro-
positions tourists and all of their evil prac-
tices it was then that i received the mes-
sage from geble clear and definite just as
all the women of the globe received it and
hope returned to my heart

there began that titanic struggle the
fight for supremacy the fight that won us
victory over the simple-minded weaklings
below who had presumptuously dared to con-
quer us the first indications that the pow-
er of our combined mental concentration at
gebles orders was taking effect was when
we saw the first of our males halt in their
wild dance of freedom they tried to shake
us off but we knew we could bring them
back to us

at first the detaxalans paid them no heed
they knew not what was happening until
there came the wholesale retreat of the golan
men back to the buildings back to the cham-
bers from which they had escaped then
grasping something of what was happening
the already defeated invaders sought to re-
tain their hold on our little people our
erstwhile captives sought to hold them with
oratorical gestures but of course we won
we saw our creatures return to us and un-
bind us

only the detaxalans did not guess the sig-

nificance of that did not realize that inas-
much as we had conquered our own men
we could conquer them also as they went
about their work of making our city their
own establishing already their autocratic
bureaus wherever they pleased we began to
concentrate upon them hypnotizing them
t the flyers that had disgorged them

and soon they began to feel of our power
the weakest ones first feeling the mental
bewilderment creeping upon them their
leaders stronger in mind knew nothing of
this at first but soon our terrible combined
mental power was forced upon them also
and they realized that their men were de-
serting them crawling back to their ships
the leaders began to exhort them into new
action driving them physically but our
power gained on them and now we began to
concentrate upon the leaders themselves
they were strong of will and they defied us
fought us mind against mind but of course
it was useless their minds were not suited
to the test they put themselves too and after
almost three ous of struggle we of gola were
able to see victory ahead

at last the leaders succumbed not a sin-
gle detaxalan was abroad in the avenues
they were within their flyers held there by
our combined wills unable to act for them-
selves it was then as easy for us to switch
the zones of force upon them subjugate them
more securely and with the annihilator beam
to disintegrate completely every ship and
man into nothingness thousands upon
thousands died that day and gola was indeed
revenged

thus my daughters ended the second in-
vasion of gola

oh yes more came from their planet to
discover what had happened to their ships
and their men but we of gola no longer
hesitated and they no sooner appeared be-
neath the mists than they too were annihila-
ted until at last detaxal gave up the thought
of conquering our cloud-laden world per-
haps in the future they will attempt it again
but we are always in readiness for them
now and our men-well they are still the
same ineffectual weaklings my daugh-
ters

bu

mac randall lounged in a chair in
his room his feet upon the table his
long slim pipe emitting vast clouds of smoke
over in the window upon the wide sill sat
his friend edwin ray idly and somewhat
crossly tapping his fingers upon the window
screen as he gazed out over san franciscos
bay

so you dont believe mac challenged
edwin across the room that there are in-
sects or bugs in the world as big as a small

man that hese ugly ferocious things
run around on two legs and stand up the
size of a pigmy

mac hesitated a moment before he ans-
wered then he said ed lets talk about
something else  hate to see you getting
this way old timer you musnt let your
love of entomology go to your head dont
let it actually get you bugs 

i wish i could show you interrupted
edwin i wish-i wish  he
across his body backward and forward a number of the things
hopped his body was becoming covered by a network of yellow
strands

paused and looking from the window again
lapsed into silence thinking

the two men had been close friends ever
since the war and now mac was worried
about his pal this was not the first time
edwin had spoken so foolishly of insects
enormous only in his own mind and mac
did not like it he arose from his chair
and took a turn about the room

tall straight and broad mac had during
those days of hate in  piloted a fighting

kling across the air lanes of eurasia and
had come home with a double handful of
medals to his credit and while he had
been hearing the zing of bullets through
his wings above edwin had been doing his
bit-a good stout bit-down below in
the mud

since the war mac had indulged his love
for aviation in one form or another for-
tunately having the necessary means while
edwin had gone in for science-chiefly

bugs bugs mac didnt like it edwin
had bugs on the brain

mac began edwin again strategi-
cally taking up without his friends realiza-
tion the subject of bugs as large as little
men tell me about your new plane

mac took the bait at once if bugs
were edwins weakness certainly the air
was macs

ed its the best
plane ive ever flown
he announced whole-
heartedly im rath-
er nutty about it all
metal you know only
one motor but a beau-
tiful thing of power
and flexibility fine

what have you on
your schedule for the
next week or so ask-
ed edwin following up
his strategy and clear-
ing the way for the
plans h e had just
formed

not a thing would
you like a trip some-
where

yes got a map

scads of em

in a few moments
edwin was pointing to
a spot in the upper
portion of brazil just
a little above the rio
negro ive got it

hundred miles-and stay there overnight
then id cross this sierra parima mountain
range here next morning and land on your
spot-that is if a guy can land-in about
two hours

mac if youll take me there i believe i
can prove to you that there are insects as
large as small men

plotted out to a dot on
a big map i have at
home mac he ex-
plained but speaking
roughly how would 
you plan to fly from frisco to right here
where my finger rests

easy hop down along the coast and
make our last filling at panama field ans-
wered mac measuring with a practiced eye
my plane is equipped with land gear and
pontoon combination id make the rio
negro the next leg-it looks about eight

vp xplorers returning
- from remote parts of

r globe have from time
time reported seeing
strange and almost unbe-
lievable forms of life
usually the stories of these
men are met with polite
yawns from conservative
authorities who remark to
themselves on the effect of
tropical heat on the senses
etc

it is quite within proba-
bility that in isolated sec-
tions a struggle for exis-
tence might have gone on
among the various forms of
life and one type might
have emerged supreme and
triumphant with undis-
puted sway over its domain
that type may have devel-
oped intelligence and to a
certain extent a control
over its environment simi-
lar to that developed by
man

you are invited by our
author to believe that this
might occur and in a man-
ner such as he relates he
tells the story it is thrill-
ing to believe it or not is
your privilege

mac was silent
he was disap-
pointed he had not
thought edwin was still
on the subject of bugs
ed youre an idiot
this thing has got
you he exclaimed
when at last he spoke
then with another
thought appealing to
him he went on but
id like that flight all
right and itll get your
mind straight again
maybe anyway it
would do us both good
lets make our plans
you make your
plans about the plane
mac agreed edwin
but let me tell you
what you must take
take along a good
high-powered rifle
also a pistol or each
hip im going to you
dont know what we
might find down there
because i know of
some of the things
those jungles do hold
it makes me wonder
what else lurks in the

forests you might say
these swamps and jungles are almost com-
pletely unexplored no telling what we
may run up on not just in insects but in
animals mac did you know that during
the coal age dragon-flies had wings two feet
across

no i didnt and my ignorande makes
no difference anyway your idea is dll bosh
great green things



but ill take a rifle and a pair of gats simply
because i like to have those things around
would you also recommend a machine gun
and a poison gas outfit-or a tank

 edwin paid no heed to macs friendly sar-
casm but in just a little while both young
men would have given everything they pos-
sessed for those same impossible articles of
war

it was not many days before macs sturdy
plane lightly lifted from the field at pana-
ma and presented came over the dense jun-
gles of south america where beneath them
they saw mother earth spread out like a
thick green carpet here and there a river
winding and treacherous broke through the
green blanket to be seen
for a moment and then
lost

tall bare peaks reach-
ed for the skies while
deep chasms with spark-
ling falls of far tumbling
water showed bright be-
neath them then they
planed over the black
rio negro that thick-
looking river of tar mac
adjusted the pontoons in-
to position now instead of
his wheels and aided in
his judgment of distance
by a ripple on the dark
surface put her smoothly
down

they rose with the sun
next morning and leaving the river crossed
the sierra parima range flying east and
north edwin had his map across his knees
and in a little while he said set her down
anywhere you can now mac these are
the forests we were in when i came with
doc winters and his party heres where
they are

put her down mocked mac wliere
on which particular tree-top do you suggest
we drape our     by jimminy theres
a lake though at that lets swing around
and see if we can get in on it

he dipped for the lake a circular green
spot in the dense jungles then as they
came in low again for the landing edwin

cried excitedly take her away thats
not water holy smoke mac thats grass
whew whistled mac as he gave the en-
gine the gun that was a close one i
had the wheels drawn up the pontoons
down wouldnt this particular part of
south america have made a messy mess of
us

they swung over the green circle below
them the second time then skilfully hand-
ling the big ship into the restricted space
mac landed his plane taxiing through the
thick grass and coming to a stop on the
edge of the circle almost against the trees
of the forest

were here ed he announced were
in pretty good i be-
lieve we can get off when
it comes to it thatll be
good too if we cant
well have to walk out and
leave the ship behind
you know what thatll be
come on hop out and
lets swing her tail around
all ready for a getaway
they jumped from the
cabin and swung the
plane around then for
a little while they inves-
tigated the opening in the
forest where they had set-
tled they went back into
the plane and after some
food and thermos bottle
refreshments-for lack
of anything better to do-fell to talking of
their trip it was still early morning

well stick around a bit said mac a lit-
tle later but well pull out of here in plenty
of time to make the river before nightfall i
dont like your jungle ed its creepy i
dont see a moving living thing but i bet
that black tangle of trees holds everything
from snakes to lizards

i dont know what family these bugs be-
long to said edwin in a low voice enlarg-
ing upon macs train of thought thats
why i should like to take a specimen back
with us i have an idea they are a species of
giant pulchriphyllium bioculatum more
commonly known as walking leaf you

wonder stories

know naturalists claim that years ago ome
vertebrates kept growing larger and larger
hr their fight for existence and their protec-
tion from each other until they finally disap-
peared perhaps these insects down here
are doing the same thing

besieged

mac said nothing there were of
course no such giant insects on
this one thing poor old edwin was off and
mac his friend was sorry about it they
sat silent for a long while mac wondering
how long before it would be safe to suggest
pulling away but they were not to go yet

everything was as silent as death not
the faintest quiver of a breeze stirred the
dark wall of foliage about them not a
whisper or sign of any form of life despite
their silence had they seen the sun
beamed upon them and their ship it was
hot with a close-pressing heat and yet
mac experienced a chill of dislike mixed
with not a little fear for the clammy tomb-
like spot

suddenly mac felt edwins warning hand
upon his knee dont give a sign mac
he whispered turn your head slowly
look over near the trees on the right
mac looked dont see a thing he mut-
tered from the corner of his mouth

that big leaf 

yes i see that looks like a big ele-
phant-ear plant or whatever we call em back
home he agreed but thats nothing
you bet it is insisted ed it wasnt
there two minutes ago

mac looked again the plant with its
big leaf divided down the middle looked to
him a great deal like a large bird per-
haps a heron the two halves of the leaf
looked like the two wings covering the body
the stalk of the plant protruding below
even looked like legs but there was no
neck no head the plant was absolutely
motionless certainly it was nothing to get
excited about

aw rats exploded mac in disgust
watch it commanded edwin ive
seen them before i know

so mac watched it for a while longer

then his interest and his gaze wandered it
was time to be going edwin was appar-
ently losing his mind mac was just about
ready to say he was pulling out when again
his pals hand fell upon his knee

look he whispered in a hiss mac
obeyed and as he did his blood ran cold
prickles of surprise and horror ran up his
spine the hair on his head tingled his
scalp

the leaf had moved t it was standing up-
right upon two squat legs from some-
where in its hideous green slimy body it
had thrust out an even more hideous head
a head upon which a face was formed of
great hanging beak and bulbous staring
eyes

the creature stood gazing at the plane
that had like a still more enormous insect
invaded its domain then while the two
men watched spellbound it slowly advanced
toward them

ed whispered mac quietly reaching
for his sporting army springfield tell me
something about em fm sorry i doubted
you i apologize absolutely theyre
worse than you said they were theyre
devilish ugh where should a fellow
shoot in the face or through the body
have they a heart

yes insects have what passes for a
heart whispered edwin thrilled almost in-
to inability to act at sight of this great speci-
men that ones heart most likely lies as
he now faces us near the surface of his
back but a bullet from your rifle would
go through fifty of them dont shoot
though lets look him over

youll have your chance before this par-
tys over grimly answered mac theyre
coming out the forest by the dozen now
my gosh mac by the hundreds may-
be wed better start up and get away look
theres a horde of them suppose they
should swarm all over us like ants over-
whelm a beetle

just at that moment a multi-colored par-
rot-perhaps alarmed by the movement of
the green creatures-broke from the trees
and flew toward the plane instantly one
of the horde sprang a full twenty feet into
the air its long arms and talon-like claws
great green things



clutched the bird with lightning-like vora-
city and even as the green beast fell back
to the grass it had thrust the parrot into its
loose-hanging mouth one gulp and it was
gone feathers and legs and tail i

mac reached for his starter but before
he could turn the engine over five or six
f the things had hopped up onto the wing
of the plane

thank your stars ed he said as he
turned off his switch again that were all
metal im afraid jo start the propeller
now its metal of course but i dont want
to risk those devils flying into it well
just have to wait until theyve looked us
over and passed on

they could hear the things up on their
wing could hear the clamping of those hor-
rid mouths as they attempted to bite through
the aluminum alloy metal

how about our tires reminded ed
gosh yes agreed mac at once admit-
ting his planes weakness you lean out
your door and shoot em away from your
tire hi keep em off my    m

crack macs rifle cut short his words
as his first bullet through the face of one
of the things saved his tire for the moment

edwins rifle was a highly prized thir-
ty-eight winchester and his first bul-
let clean through the body proved as ef-
fective as macs head shot

after that they fired as rapidly as they
could operate their weapons a moment or
two ago they had had no warning of danger
mac had even not believed that such crea-
tures existed but now with the advent of
their hideous numbers they realized that
swarming death assailed them almost ev-
ery shot counted but still the horde marched
on they swarmed upon the wing and upon
the body of the plane until mac becajne
alarmed as to whether or not the wing
could stand the strain he opened a door in
the roof of the cabin and firing rapidly
dropped a number of the green bodies from
the wing then just in time he lowered his
head and slammed shut the door a dozen
of the beasts had pounced at him

ed he said openly admitting their
plight we re in a bad way theyve got

brains-those slimy devils-and they use
em they jumped at me

just as he spoke the disaster they feared
overtook them for there came from their
lending gear two separate explosions the
men looked at each other their faces pale

gone now were on our rims cant
get out on flats through this thick grass
mac said simply

damn them cursed edwin through
clenched teeth leaning far from his cabin
door and pumping his winchester at the
great insects still gnawing at the tire on his
side his anger was his undoing the
giant things flung themselves upon his head
and shoulders from above and as he top-
pled out the cabin more of the beasts seized
him from beneath the plane in an instant
edwin was covered with them

mac shut his door then sprang out after
his friend he drew the two pistols and
following edwin closely shot the things
away from him so that he was able to regain
his feet edwin fought bravely swinging
his rifle with telling effect mac felt them
swarming upon his own shoulders until he
was forced to shoot himself free of the dev-
ilish things

then edwin was down again driven to
earth by the ferocious insects that pounced
and hopped from every direction mac
fought his way back to the plane his empty
pistols and his fists sinking into the soft
faces before him

in the cabin again he feverishly reloaded
and fired pouring shot after shot into the
green bodies dragging edwin away but he
could not check that mass of clinging
swarming devils that before his horrified
eyes dragged off hia friend when his rifle
stretched out a giant insect three pounced
in to take its place

mac wailed then his springfield ready to
do for his pal if opportunity offered the
only thing left he was determined with
a bullet to save edwin from the torture of
their terrible mouths but not until the
great green things had their victim some
fifty yards in front of the plane did mac ob-
tain a glimpse of him and then because of
the movements of the things mac held that
merciful bullet


wonder stories

edwin was flung flat on his back on the
grass and across his body backward and
forward a number of the filthy things hop-
ped and strode at first mac could not
understand not until he saw that edwins
body was becoming covered this way and
that by a network of yellowish strands did
he realize that the green things were weav-
ing a net across their captive securely tying
him down to the long grass then they left
him left him decided mac until they
were more ready for their horrible feast
than they were just at present

he groaned aloud in his plight what
could he do he cursed his utter helpless-
ness what could he try even if he had
box after box of ammunition for the spring-
field he could not hope to shoot away the
thousand brutes still surrounding him but
his ammunition was running short there
were still a lot of edwins cartridges but
the rifle edwin so treasured was fifty feet
from the plane and fifty feet   

strategy

hat could he do he racked his
brain looking around the cabin of
the plane for inspiration he had rope
how could he use that he thought of the
things he might be able to use-if he only
had them a machine gun hand gren-
ades dynamite poison gas oh what
was the use all he could do was save one
bullet for edwin and then after he had
pioved his engines inability to get him out
to starve to death in his cabin or to fling
himself-insane-into their waiting mouths

i wonder he said aloud how tough
that web is across ed ive got to find out
if i can cause im going to try to cut him
loose if its the last thing i do

he took his rope and made a running
noose in the end watching his chance he-
dropped it about one of the big insects and
dragged it to him

he lifted the enormous bug into the cabin
fighting down its clawing talons avoiding
its snapping mouth and securely wrapping
it in his rope trussed and bound he flung
it on the floor of the cabin and there the
creature helpless and fear-filled exuded

from its body the ropish material with which
edwin was bound

mac watched it harden then he tested it
it was tough and strong to the pull but
when he took a long knife he found it sev-
ered like so much dough

if he could reach edwin he would soon
cut him loose but how could he get there
he would not get twenty feet toward him
before they would drag him down then
both of them would be helpless bound vic-
tims lying waiting for the green things to
come to the feast to help edwin to out-
guess the devils seemed as far away as ever

but after a while desperate mac went
into action part of their supplies had been
carried in a good-sized box mac dumped
these then he filled the box full of waste
stuffing his sweater in for good measure
then with wire he encircled the box so that
the contents could not fall out he tied a
light cord into the waste coiling it on top
of the sweater from a gasoline supply
tank he ran in perhaps three gallons of the
fuel and then working quickly he put his
plan into action

he saw there were no green things dan-
gerously close at the moment so stepping
from his plane and holding the end of the
light rope coiled in the box in his left hand
he ran quickly as far as he dared beyond
his wing-tip and hurled his box toward the
heavier mass of the creatures then he
sprang to his plane again

he heard the sharp buzz of their wings as
they leaped at him felt them alight upon
him the long knife from his belt sunk
deeply and easily into the filthy clinging
beasts he fought them off regained his
plane then at once he touched a match
to the rope he held in his hand

he saw the flame rush along the saturated
rope like the spark follows a train of pow-
der saw his box break into swirling flame
greater than even he expected

pandemonium broke loose then into that
great flame the green things leaped to be
burned to a crisp on the instant as though
their oily bodies too were gasoline satur-
ated the air was full of a roar as of a
thousand motors as the infuriated insects
great green things



scorched and maddened flung themselves to
the flames like so many foolish moths

mac dropped from the cabin raced under
his wing to edwin some of them barred
his path but he shot and cut them down
they pounced upon him but his knife took
its toll

reaching edwin he slashed the soft rope
woven about him in two long cuts then with
one movement flung him to his shoulders
the few green things that were not still fling-
ing themselves to the flames challenged his
path again but they could not stop him
their soft bodies offered no resistance to his
knife

mac reached the plane and pushed edwin
in upon the cabin floor then clambered in
himself at once edwin sat up

by jupiter mac he cried that was
splendid i thought i was gone but i
dont believe-i believe im not even hurt
hurry up and find out ed old boy
mac insisted feets see if theres a possible
chance of getting away here take my
rifle dont lean out too far but keep em
from the propeller im going to start the
motor

the flames from the box were dying down
but they still kept most of the devils inter-
ested mac started his motor quickly giv-
ing her a generous throttle so as to speed-
ily get her to her full power only an occa-
sional shot from edwin was necessary to
keep a green thing from the whirling blade
then as soon as he could mac gave full
throttle but the plane wouldnt move

mac clenched his teeth and cursed no
good ed he said were trapped your
damned devils will get us tires are flat
grass is heavy hells bells

can we get out and push   asked edwin

vr es well try it take a knife to fight
jl em off keep your eyes open ill
give her full gun push like blazes and
dont get left if she starts to roll we do
have a bit of a down-grade in our favor
they sprang out again the engine roaring

wide open ttiey pushed and lifted at the
plane until the veins in their foreheads stood
out hard they rocked the flat tires out of
the hollows they had formed in the lush
grass

the plane rolled ahead an inch then inch-
es then feet the boys still pushed fierce-
ly she rolled faster gathering speed
they pushed and strained and lifted then
sprang aboard

mac forced his engine to the limit then
the plane rolled smartly over the spot upon
which edwin had been so recently tied it
increased in speed until mac knowing he
had to take the air or crash into the trees
ahead of him risked everything when he
asked the ship to rise

she bounced sluggishly once or twice
then she was riding smoothly in the free air
her roaring engine now bravely and rapidly
increasing their speed

mac banked a bit and swung for a thinner
and lower part of the forest only by inch-
es they skimmed over then they were clear
-gone-free

	they did not say much until once again
the inky rio negro lay beneath them as
mac adjusted his pontoons for a landing he
said close enough ed we just got out
weve a story the world wont believe
though i didnt until i saw em say
hold on i forgot that we have one to take
home with us to prove our story the one

i	lassoed

but next morning before they left the riv-
er for the hop to panama they consigned
the hideous green thing to the depths its
condition made it everything but a desirable
companion it was rapidly getting worse

were well rid of all of them edwin
said theres just one thing i regret
whats that

my rifle id had it a long while im
sorry i lost 

edwin ray my boy broke in mac
would you suggest we go back for it

no mac we wont go back panama
james then home

the return from jupiter
what has gone before



attus marce commander of the armed forces of
neina ganymede satellite of pleida jupiter re-
turns to neina to tell his father rulerof the satel-
lite that dolmician emperor of pleida intends to
invade neina arul enslave the people his allies in a
war against dolmician have deserted and neina i left
to battle alone

he asks for immediate mobilization of neina and
states that there is one way to save neina from the
superior pleidan forces the old scientist whom auus
rescued from the earth and who is now a guest of
neina has the secret of an alloy which can destroy all
the water on pleida but the scientist remembering
that the use of this alloy  warfare has destroyed all
the water on the earth and made it a desert refutes

to give it up instead he tells the neinian nobles that
neina is becoming cold and must be vacated soon
he has perfected a method of restoring the water to
the earth and suggests that the neinians emigrate to
the earth

the scientist is despatched to earth to make it habi-
table while marce soars into space with his fleet to
meet the pleidan invasion nina daughter of the
earth scientist mobilizes the people of neina and
when the pleidan fleet having overcome marce land
on neina she blows up a number of the ships and
leads the people against the soldiers but she is cap-
tured and the people subdued

meanwhile old auus ruler of neina has myster
iously deserted his people and soared into space in 
rocket-ship

now go on with the story

she felt rough hands take hold of her
turning furiously with weapon up-
raised to meet her attackers she discovered
that she was already a prisoner held in the
vice-like grip of four pleidans

behind them leering at her from a dis-
tance beyond the possible reach of her
weapon was salvarius carde

you are one of the tellurians he said
accusingly because of you neina has re-
belled because of you we have had trouble
subduing her

perhaps you have not succeeded even
yet

the pleidan leader swept his hand toward
the middle of the field but nina did not
turn to look instead she stared at this
hideous figure almost human in form yet a
great deal also like a frog her eyes were
burning with hatred and contempt

neina is now in my hands he went on
and i will teach you and all the others
what it means to resist the authority of
dolmician

with a quick gesture one of her captors
disarmed her she was thrust closer to sal-
varius carde by two of the pleidans whose
loathsome hands gripped her like vices
carde gestured suddenly toward the launch-
ing tower and pushing his face within a
few inches of her demanded where went
old alius

nina stood her ground though her face
was paler now i do not know-perhaps
he is in the palace she said evasively

he left in a space-ship you know it
where did he go

i have no means of knowing that he
did not tell me

nina shrugged her shoulders it was
the pleidans time to show his anger you
will tell in time he prophesied you will
also tell us where the other tellurian is
we will have both of you-all three of you
-yes and by deiminos we will have alius
marce too and we will make public ex-
amples of you ptah- and he spat upon
her as she stood helplessly before him tens-
ing her muscles to resist the fury that
welled up within her

and as for the others said salvarius
carde issuing a general order round them
up and get them to the mines

chapter ix

prepare to work in space

now was the lone voyager in space the
bright rocket-ship that had borne the
old man of tellus and the neinian scien
tists approaching the earth that was the
object of their journey

grouped around the observation windows
of the craft the neinians watched with eager
straining eyes for to nearly all of them a
close glimpse of this earth was new and ex-
citing only three had ever seen it be-
fore they had accompanied alius marce
upon his epochal journey when he had res-
cued nina and her father from death by
thirst upon this planet the others had only
heard of that exploit and were now feasting
their own eyes upon the wonders and mya-

they were being hurled

the sun was reflected
from its surface with
frightful intensity as if
they were looking
down upon a polished
crystal mirror some 
alarmed by this phen-
omena went to the
aged tellurian scien-
tist

your earth is boil-
ing hot they said

you have brought us
to a planet that consists
of molten stone

not molten stone
he corrected them but
crystal salt and areas
devoid of life and vege-
tation to absorb the
rays we shall find
the earth no hotter than
it always was except
that the weight of the
atmosphere dense with
all the gases that were
formerly the seas
holds in the heat and
makes even the temper-
ate zones tropical in
temperature while the
poles once icy-cold
are now gently warmed
by the ceaseless currents of the air it is
near them that we shall find it most pleasant
to begin our work

he saw that already they had left the
cold moon behind that the earths bare

surface was approaching at a frightful rate

what is our speed he asked the en-
gineers	-

more than ten miles a second measured
by your tellurian scale

we must slow down
to five

we can do it with
the rockets at the
nose

les even when there was no movement to
be made

but they had little time to observe the
innumerable subtle changes that were tak-
ing place in them and in the car for now the
old man was like a demon striding up and
down the crowded laboratory searching out
his men hastening them to their posts

in a few minutes he declared we shall
be ready to do the work for which we have
come so far

he ordered them to begin the laborious
task of donning their space suits out of
the storage spaces came these cumbrous ob-
jects helmeted like weird objects from the
depths of the sea curiously sagging and
empty like the tenantless
skins cast off by snakes

the old man himself
was the first man to enter
one while two aides
helped him he thrust
trembling limbs into the
strong fabric tubes meant
for arms and legs and
worked his hands into the
metal gauntlets quickly
they sealed him into the
suit and placed on his
shoulders the huge metal
helmet with its tanks and
radio a pack contain-
ing additional supplies
went on his back but still
the little window at the
front remained open so
that he could talk directly with the others
until the time came to go out into space

he went forward again to the control
room and strode nervously among the
engineers

where are we now he asked noting
that the features of tellus were alarmingly
close he could make out the mountain
chains and valleys of north america the
huge glittering depressions that had been
the seas even the islands that had once
thrust themselves up about the surface of
the lapping waves to give ground for palms
men and animals the whole western hm
isphere seemed spread out before him like

a convex map clear except for the hazy
atmosphere that seemed to swathe the globe
like a bluish smoky veil

the engineers finished their computa-
tions

we are between five and six hundred
miles out they replied

our speed

we are reducing it rapidly

the course

around the earth as you directed

the old man turned abruptly back to-
ward the laboratory where the scientists
from neina following his example were in
their space suits waiting for further orders

there was a strange restrained hush
among them they were
like men expecting to
plunge themselves into
battle

every man knows his
place and what he is to
do said the tellurian
if you obey my com-
mands there will be no
hitch in our plans we
must work quickly and
accurately

in the quiet of the lab-
oratory a bell rang sud-
denly the old man
picked up a telephone
that put him in commun-
ication with the control
room we have reached
your speed and altitude
declared an engineer

are we in free flight

yes

the rocket holds its orbit around the
earth without the application of power for
steering or speed

we have checked our course the orbit
holds

the scientist put up the telephone and
turned as gravely as an oracle toward his
listeners

prepare to work in space he com-
manded quietly

	  

if there had been an observer on the sur-
face of the earth he would have seen a

wonder stories

curious phenomenon in the clear sky above
him in the twenty-four hours that followed
at first there was only the glistening cart-
ridge of metal from another world taking
its course around the earth from west to
east scarcely visible at five hundred miles
a tiny mite that flew with terrific speed but
drew no closer

then not a little like tiny parasites emerg-
ing from a host there came out of it from
an opening near the rear a swarm of tiny
animalcules-objects more like balloons
than men grotesque creatures of fabric rub-
ber and metal futuristic robots each with
a burden many times larger than himself
and each linked to the monster rocket-craft
by a thin cord that kept him from being
wafted away or losing his way in space

for a long time they seemed to hover there
around the flying space-car gradually mov-
ing with their burdens in a kind of unreal
dance moving together apart readjusting
their positions gradually as the figures
glided here and there by discharging bright
flashes of rocket fuel from specially designed
space locomotion guns the objects they were
carrying began to grow together to take
form in the abyss of the sky four hundred
miles above the cottony layers of air that
swathed the whirling misty globe

and now had an observer been gazing
at them through some terrestrial telescope
he would have been astonished at the thing
about which they swarmed it was follow-
ing after the space-car fastened to it like
the objects that has fashioned it by a long
tow-cord of flexible metal perhaps a chain
or cable it was shaped not unlike a huge
saucer hundreds of yards in diameter with
its bottom toward the earth and its upper
concave surface facing toward the sun

having completed so much the pygmies
afloat in space were still not content re-
peatedly in a procession like that of ants
making visits to a pool of syrup they re-
turned to the space-craft and brought out
of it new burdens-additional parts for the
saucer they had constructed on the under
side there began to grow a bulbous ex-
crescence like the basket of a huge balloon
fastened close to the saucers convex bot-
tom by girders of metal into this cup en-

tered the workers carrying instruments

generators thermo-couples reflectors gyro-
balances

meanwhile the rocket-car and its strange
appendages kept up its incredibly swift
journey around the earth in a slightly ec-
centric natural orbit that required no energy
to maintain for the time being the neinians
and their craft had become satellites of the
earth traveling at such a speed and such
a distance as would have kept them im-
prisoned forever in an orbit around tell us
had they been without power to steer or
speed up their craft

four times they circled the earth spend-
ing less than two hours in each revolution
gradually the huge object they were build-
ing grew complete each portion fitting its
place as the tellurian scientist had planned
the old man himself had been the first to
step from the speeding space-flyer into noth-
ingness at the beginning of the building
operation his space suit ballooning about
him hideously his old head sheathed in the
heavy metal hood until he was unrecogniz-
able except for his energy the continual
waving of his arms his close inspection of
the machine as they put it together

in space

the neinian scientists observing the
old tellurians activity marveled that
anyone could have so much strength to ex-
pend upon such a project they could not
see the fierce zeal in his eyes or they might
have marvelled even more as his contriv-
ance took shape in space above the earth
the aged scientist was like a consecrated
priest before the altar of his god each
curve rivet bolt and seam of its design he
knew from hours of poring over the plans in
the laboratory of the space ship from ex-
amining each piece as it had been fashioned
by his aides

now that it was actually being constructed
he let no detail escape him nor did he per-
mit any delay on the part of the neinians
many of whom grew quickly tired of their
labors despite the matters of great moment
they knew depended upon them

at last the huge disc with its carriage
the return from jupiter



underneath that housed innumerable intri-
cate machines was complete its upward
concave side was a glittering mirror catch-
ing the rays of the blistering sun reflect-
ing them toward the center where they fell
upon the battery of thermocouples that
transformed the heat instantly into electric-
ily

the old man entered the air-locked cabin
underneath started the machinery with a
switch and felt the generators hum through
the heavy padding of his suit he glanced
at the indicators and checked the output of
the couples and that of the ray generators
he tested the efficiency of the machinery he
had caused to be created during the journey
and hung here in space

while he went over the apparatus once
more making sure that everything was in
working order others under orders min-
utely examined the seams between the under-
side of the saucer-reflector and the basket of
metal that carried the machines they were
air-tight

the old man heard them report their find-
ings through the radio sets that held them
all in communication then start the air-
generators he directed four men must
stay here to watch our machines and to
keep in touch with us they have already
been selected and are now making ready

he saw that his directions had been obey-
ed the suits of those inside the basket be-
gan to wrinkle as if being deflated while
the pressure of oxygen and nitrogen around
them increased presently when he judged
that sufficient pressure had been generated
to support life the old man jerked open
the little window in his helmet and breathed
deeply testing the new-made air

the others did likewise for the first
time in hours they conversed normally

this is the power-house in space that
will supply us with the energy we need to
bring water to the earth the old man ex-
plained when we are ready we will rjn
away from it in the space-car leaving it
to continue on its course around the earth
gyroscopes continually in motion hold it
with the concave mirror always toward the
sun unless it becomes necessary to shut off
the power to get into the mirror to make

i

repairs in which case by precession it can
be tilted out of the direct rays and plunged
into the darkness and chill of space

the energy we need will be supplied us
by di-thurnian waves generated directly from
elctricity they will be caught in reflectors
placed on the surface of tellus and there
will be transformed again into electricity to
feed my water-machine

but will there be sufficient power
the old man gazed questioningly at his
interrogator

in my tests made just now he returned
 i found that my preliminary estimates
will be more than justified in this re-
flector and its apparatus we have a power
plant capable of generating more power
than was ever available on the earth before
the invention of the water-motor with it
we shall be able to supply the needs of the
earth for many years to come-and if more
are necessary later it will be a simple mat-
ter to build tem and let them send their
energy down in waves to lift all burdens
from the backs of men

a ringing bell interrupted them the
old man paused that is the reflectors
crew he said we are ready to turn it
over to them

pressing a button he answered the sum-
mons one of the other stepped to the air-
lock pulled the lever that closed the outer
door and opened the inner one the four
men who had been selected to remain above
the earth filed in

the tellurian helped them out of their
space-suits

you have been instructed he said
are you ready

the four nodded briskly

yon can remain in constant touch with
us he said but you must realize that
should anything go wrong you can depend
on no one but yourselves

again they nodded more soberly the
old mans eyes swept over them remember-
ing how much depended upon his power-
house in space the foremost was a scien-
tist whose work was well known throughout
neina he had forsaken family and pro-
fession to join the tellurian on the venture
into space the others were likewise trained


wonder stories

men determined resourceful the old
scientist looked at them and smiled i can
depend upon you he said

the leader saluted gravely we shall
follow your instruction he replied and
you may depend on us

the others were already entering the air-
lock preparing to return to the space-ship
the old scientist impulsively shook the
hands of each member of the reflector crew
an ancient tellurian custom which he had
never been able to cause the neinians to
adopt but which they nevertheless recog-
nized as a sincere gesture of friendship and
faith then with a quick motion he ad-
justed his helmet and followed into the
airlock in a moment they were ejected
into space

the space-car lay not far ahead of them
seemingly without motion beneath
them the great earth spun rapidly almost
dizzily

quickly they reeled themselves to the
craft that had brought them from neina and
entering it through another air-lock closed
the metallic cartridge after them the scien-
tist surveyed the interior of his ship noting
its gloomy emptiness now that the segments
of the giant reflector had been removed
with rapid steps he made his way forward
to the control room and consulted with the
crafts chief engineer

our speed is almost exactly five miles
a second the latter reported we are
holding to the orbit

everything is ready for the landing

the other nodded

then cut loose from the reflector and
speed away from it we must not disturb its
motion

the engineer nodded the old tellurian
suddenly felt a great weariness seize him
the days task had been difficult and strenu-
ous but he could not rest now when the
most perilous hours of the whole flight were
at hand the actual landing upon the planet
he had come to rescue from its untimely
drying slowly he strode aft to join the
neinian scientists who were watching the
power-house they had set adrift to swing
forever around the earth

chapter x

the landing

the huge space-car its folding wings
outspread to their greatest extent to
break its fall spun rapidly about the earth
in the last stages of ks landing maneuvers

the tellurian gazing eagerly at his
world as it flashed beneath them in the
glaring light of the sun saw that everywhere
it was dry and dead glittering with salt or
crusted with dust or creeping with drifting
waves of wind-blown sand the space-
craft gradually changing its course from
that of the power-house still floating in
space at last was approaching the surface
in a long loop that took them first over the
south pole and then over the north

at the south pole they could discern noth-
ing but the crumpled mountain ranges that
had long been known to have lain beneath
the ice-cap which once rested there but as
they approached the north pole the old
man suppressing an exclamation pointed
with excitement to a field of glaring bright-
ness that suddenly appeared before them
passed beneath and disappeared behind
what is it the neinians asked

ice	

the old tellurians excitement was mys-
tifying to them

but there is not very much the mois-
ture represented there could hardly be used
to support life on the earth-

of course not he replied that is the
residue probably of all the water that re-
mained in the atmosphere when the last of
the lakes and oceans disappeared but
dont you understand the significance of this
cap of ice

they shook their heads

it means that some chemistry vital to
our plans has been at work when my
daughter and i were rescued from this plan-
et not many years ago the air contained a
minute all-pervading ferment of the metal-
lic alloy that caused water to dissolve in a
boiling cloud of oxygen and nitrogen that
alloy if it were still present in the atmos-
phere would also have destroyed the water
frozen in that patch of polar ice as soon as
the return from jupiter



it began to collect here had it still been
active

this discovery means that if we succeed
in transmuting an element and manufactur-
ing water we shall not need to worry about
the substance that destroyed the water of the
globe that preceded it some acid in the
air-perhaps one of the rare nitric com-
pounds produced in minute quantities by the
combustion of water has been slowly at
work and has destroyed the alloy

the space-ship its speed tremendously
reduced by the resistance of the air encoun-
tered in its circular flight around the earth
was now going slowly enough to make land-
ing possible

we must select a spot not too far from
the north polar regions the tellurian di-
rected the engineers signalled assent as
they eagerly watched the surface ahead and
below

not far away they spied a flat place ap-
parently suitable a jangling bell warned
everyone in the ship that a landing attempt
was about to be made the crew and scien-
tists hastily sought their landing hammocks
the ship nosed perceptibly downward the
earth came rushing upward at them fell
away came up again

then they felt the terrific crashing of the
space-cars carriage on uneven ground the
huge machine groaned side-slipped came
abruptly to a stop amid a cloud of dust
that spiraled upward in the thick lazy air

the old man was first on his feet tugging
and pulling at the others to see if any were
hurt one man had crashed his head against
a stanchion and was lying still either un-
conscious or dead the tellurian called
physicians to attend to him while he mar-
shalled the others bidding them to get ready
for their first walk on tellus

i am going to open the door he said

the neinians many bruised and ill as a
result of their strenuous efforts in building
the reflector their reactions to the long ride
through space and finally the roughness
of the landing were nevertheless eager to
see the new world they shouted their ap-
proval f his intention

the tellurian eagerly unfastened the

heavy door that led into the airlock and in
a moment the outer door also was open

they had landed upon a slightly rolling
plain somewhere in what had been
northwestern canada in the days of the
tellurians toward the west the land
mounted perceptibly in a series of long low
foothills no doubt reaching in the hazy dis-
tance to the chains of the canadian rockies
that were still high and rugged in these
parts on the east not above a mile from
the scored flat upon which the rocket-ship
had made its landing was a basin or flat
valley in which in olden days a small lake
had lain

around it there were still traces of the
long-dead vegetation that had once hedged
it in dessicated half-buried stumps of
trees banks where matted wisps of dried
grass still hung whispering skeletons of
weeds and here and there the bleached bones
of animals that had succumbed there

the neinians looked at each other in
wonder that any remnant of earthly life
could have survived so long but the old
tellurian pointed out to them that since all
life had been destroyed by the sudden dis-
appearance of water not even bacterial
forms had remained to cause decay

they all perceived that the space-flyer
had selected what was almost an ideal spot
for their experiment an open area suffi-
ciently large for setting up their power
gathering device a broad shelf upon which
to carry on their experiments with the old
scientists mysterious machine and finally
if success attended their efforts a natural
basin in which to catch and hold the first
trickles of moisture from their laboratory

the air of tellus was heavy and acrid
from the excess of oxygen and traces of
malignant acid compounds that it contained
nevertheless they found that they could ac-
custom themselves to it and the natural air
however strange was a welcome relief from
the artificial atmosphere they had been
forced to breathe during so many weeks of
flight from neina

the old man led them for a tour of in-
spection over the shelf upon which their
rocket lay permitting them to accustom

their bodies gradually to the conditions of
tellus her greater gravity the extreme
pressure of the air the dryness of the sur-
face he saw that the early tellurian night
coming slowly in such high latitudes was
near and decided that their first concern
should be to make a camp in which they
could live in comfort while the work was
going on

accordingly they visited the small forest
of dessicated trees at the edge of the empty
lake and from a few of them succeeded in
building the skeleton of a shelter against
the chill of the coming night and the heat of
the next days sun by the time they had
thrown together the beginnings of the struc-
ture night had fallen

the old man showed them how to gather
shorter bits of the aged wood in small piles
and how to ignite them and soon in the
first darkness of the evening that was to
mark a new era for the earth camp-fires
crackled once more beneath the ancient tel-
lurian sky as in the long-forgotten times

the wood burned with uncommon bright-
ness because of the plentiful oxygen and
turned all too suddenly to smoke and ashes
but as the sparks showered upward the
neinians glad as children for the relaxation
and comparative safety of their camp how-
ever strange it was to them lay back on
their robes with their faces to the heavens
and watched bright jupiter in his course un-
able to see but knowing that neina and the
other satellites were close by whirling in
their endless courses around him

of the events that had transpired there
since their departure they of course knew
nothing yet each stared upward at the bright
planet and its satellites with silent forebod-
ing knowing well that neinas downfall if
not already accomplished was inevitable
and wondering what had become of wives
parents children and other loved ones they
had left behind to come on this queer quest
through space for a better place to live

as they lay there in the light of their
crackling fires the moon arose and they
exclaimed in wonder at the beauty of the
sight the old man of tellus-lay looking
at it long after the others had fallen to
sleep planning for the activities of the next

day and wondering at the outcome of his
voyage across nothingness to the planet of
his birth

tomorrow we shall be ready

tenderly they took the strange mach-
ine out of its packing in the metal pro-
jectile and now in the shelter of the hast-
ily constructed laboratory the old man and
two assistants were assembling it

on the flat toward the west nearly all the
rest of the neinians were concerned with
the erection of a huge convex mirror a lit-
tle like that which they had left swinging
around them in the sky but smaller and
covered at its upper side with innumerable
bare bright wires like spidery antennae

it was the receiving reflector designed to
collect and transform the energy sent by the
power-house in space

it was mounted upon a short heavy tower
of metal which permitted it to be swung on
a universal joint toward any quarter of the
heavens somewhere far to the south of
them they knew the power-collector was still
circling tellus ready to supply them with
energy when they had need through the
heavy layers of atmosphere and even
through the rocky earth itself the energy-
bearing waves would come to this reflector
from the invisible sky-mirror when the in-
stallation was complete

the tellurian had no doubts about the
energy-supply the observatory and pow-
er-house in space made use of no new prin-
ciple similar reflectors had been in use
on jupiter for generations but to the as-
sembling of his water-maker he was devot-
ing his full attention with his assistants
he went over every step in the projected
conversion of tellurian atmosphere into wa-
ter they examined the heavy tanks into
which the gas would be compressed to be
released in relatively small quantities into
the glass-lined chamber by the side of the
exciter-tube

it was this tube that was the heart of the
machine the very essence of the contri-
vance it was more than twenty feet in
length made of heavy glass electrodes ap-
peared in either end and through a tiny
the return from jupiter



window at the side a smaller tube led di-
rectly into the chamber of compressed gas
which it was expected to activate

with alpha rays rutherford knocked
protons out of the nuclei of nitrogen the
old man said this tube does not generate
alpha rays but discharges instead a torrent
of electrons moving so rapidly that they
will on striking the nuclei of nitrogen
knock out not one proton but fourteen thus
reducing each atom of the heavier gas into
fourteen prospective atoms of hydrogen
these protons dancing in a veritable show-
er of swiftly-moving electrons will drift to
the edges of the torrent where slower-mov-
ing electrons will readily unite with them
we will have on one side a steady stream of
nitrogen going into our compression cham-
ber and on the other side a stream of new
hot hydrogen leaving it

the assistants were enlightened by this
simple explanation of the machine they saw
before them

but water they asked

that is the simplest part we will care-
fully ignite our hydrogen in oxygen avoid-
ing an explosion by blowing the gases to-
gether from separate jets and igniting them
only at the point of mingling the result-
ing stream we will catch in a worm and
cooling it will reduce it to water before
our eyes

from time to time pausing in their lab-
ors the two assistants stared in astonish-
ment at the vigor with which the old man
applied himself to the work despite the
high latitude in which they had pitched their
camp the sun was hot and the slattern shed
of rough and splintered logs little protec-
tion against it perspiration started from
their pores but hardly once did the old man
pause to join them in their rest except when
there was an explanation to be made or an
intricate operation to be described

throughout the day they worked reas-
sembling the machine that had once been
complete on neina the thing was a maze
of wires coils pumps in the compression
chamber they installed the apparatus that
separated the nitrogen from the oxygen and
other gases of the atmosphere so that it
would flow into the activating chamber in a

pure state they fastened the huge engine
securely to its metal and concrete base and
in turn fastened the base to the earth with
angular metal stakes that went down deep
into the dry soil

night came again and put a stop to
their labors but long after the others
had gone to rest at the camp the old man
puttered about by artificial light making
final adjustments poring over his connec-
tions examining every part and portion of
the awesome all-important contrivance

hours later when at length he pulled
himself away from the machine he found
the neinians waiting for him a hush fell
upon them as he approached he felt the
power of their reverence as he joined the
circle for now they considered him a super-
man indeed a mighty inventor of countless
contrivances master of air earth water
fire and all the elements and in addition
a man of iron capable of putting into any
project such furious zeal as to shame any
neinian

you must rest they said to him for
tomorrow 

tomorrow  the word echoed
strangely as he pronounced it we shall be
ready to try-the machine if it is a suc-
cess we shall not have made this trip in vain
but if it fails-neina is doomed

chapter xi
water

the little band of neinians like nervous
husbands awaiting word of the birth of
their first-born had drawn a little way off
at the order of the old man of tellus only
his two assistants were privileged to be pre-
sent with him in the shack of a laboratory
when the great lever was thrown in inaug-
urating the test of the water-maker

four neinians stood at the base of the
tower on which was perched the huge power-
collector moving it stealthily their ears at-
tuned to words which were coming to them
from space the crew of the power-house
above the earth was signalling its position
making ready to deliver the first supply of


wonder stories

sun-power ever sent direct to earth by di-
thurnian waves

slowly the collecting-mirror moved into
position to catch the pencil of rays that
would soon descend upon it from out of the
dim and misty nothingness toward the south
a scientist watching its motion suddenly
signalled for a halt position he called

instantly the watchers stiffened the
first part of the intricate profcess of chang-
ing the earths atmosphere into water had
been accomplished the collector had made
contact with the space power-house energy
was ready to be delivered in vast quantities
to the engine the old man had hidden in his
tumbledown laboratory near the shores of
the extinct lake

toward the laboratory a huge thick cab-
le like a black snake ran from the collector
in a few minutes if all went well it would
throb with such a charge of electricity as
had never been confined in so small a line
before on tellus and electricity that had
never before been destined for so important
a use anywhere in the universe

they waited half afraid to speak for the
signal that was to be given by the old man
the sun moved slowly toward the zenith of
his course the tellurian summer they ob-
served was already on the wane the
warm weather of these parts would be pass-
ing in a few weeks and if the experiment
were not a success there would probably be
no chance to build another machine and try
again for many months it was doubtful
if they could hold out long enough supplies
were already getting low in the space-car
scarcely enough remained to last out the
return journey to neina should one be at-
tempted

much depended indeed upon the out-
come of the experiment

suddenly they saw the signal the old
man came to the door of his laboratory and
waved a white cloth shouting his orders
the scientist in charge of the power-collector
caused an assistant to throw the huge switch
the black cable abruptly beeame a conduct-
or of electricity though the circuit at the
laboratory had not yet been closed they
saw by the indicators and other signs that
the collector was working that enormous

currents of energy were pouring through the
atmosphere to collect upon its concave sur-
faces to pass through its transformers its
generators to flow finally into the conduit
that led down the gently sloping hillside to
an unprepossessing shack at the shore of a
dry and extinct lake

and then it happened there was a sud-
den rushing clattering sound below des-
pite the glaring light of the noonday sun
they beheld an eerie illumination dart from
the buildings many cracks green golden
filled with dancing motes and spots the
dry air crackled snarled they heard in-
numerable rushing whistling noises

still no one moved remembering the old
scientists earnest warning not to approach
the shack until he had given specific per-
mission for minutes that seemed hours no
sign of human life was apparent below
the sputtering the strange light-all the
weird manifestations of energy continued
increased some began to grow alarmed
what if the first discharge of the huge elect-
ron-tube had killed the scientist and his
aides perhaps they had received no sig-
nal because they were even now struggling
in death agony or worse had been com-
pletely disintegrated by the torrents of elect-
rons that had come rushing at them from
the giant valve

at length one of the neinians the chief
engineer of the rocket-ship could stand
the suspense no longer against the speci-
fic order of the old tellurian he left the
waiting group and made his way toward the
shack as if hypnotized by the green radia-
tions emanating from the laboratory the oth-
ers followed not running but walking slow-
ly and cautiously toward the building the
engineer reached the door first the others
immediately behind it was closed he
thrust it open with a quick blow

a hideous burst of the green light came
pouring out upon them blinding them af-
ter a moment they saw the aged scientist and
his aides inside hurrying around their mach-
ine like madmen adjusting here inspecting
there making changes measuring above
their heads lay the huge tube too brilliant
to look at hurling its electrons like cosmic
the return from jupiter



javelins into the compressed nitrogen in the
tank in another place-marvelous to look
at but mysterious-burned a jet of yellow
fire in a closed glass container

the neinians had got this far with their
investigation when the old man spied them
twith a shout he waved his arms at them-
a shout of triumph glee unquenchable jub-
ilation - with a long skinny finger he
pointed toward the end of the machine
where now one of the aides was bending
making tests at that end there was a spout
and from the spout there came trickling a
tiny stream-an almost invisible flow but
a flow that was unmistakably water

we have succeeded declared the old
man water-water-

but so little objected one of the nein-
ian scientists

the old tellurian smiled as for that
he said we are only making a test if
you want volume here it is

he seized the handle of a rheostat that
controlled the flow of current into the mach-
ine the glaring colors of the tubes eman-
ations suddenly became intense-a blaze of
light that seemed to press upon them it
filled the room as if it had substance waves
of heat swept upon them the flame in the
glass container spurted brighter became a
fiery blast

and it was then that a cry of joy went
up from the neinians for they saw the
water increase from a trickle to a little tor-
rent pouring from the spout still hot it
gushed into the vessel the old man had pre-
pared for it filling it overflowing on the
dry sand soaking in making a little puddle
on the laboratory floor

the neinians shouting and laughing like
children ran in and seized up samples of it
in their drinking cups putting it to their
lips hot as it was eager to taste this water
that had just been made by the transmuta-
tion of elements

the old man of the earth watched them
with tears of pleasure in his eyes in the
distant past the earth people had dreamed
of transmuting the baser elements into rare
ones for monetary gain now the trick had
actually been done elements had been
transmuted-to produce water the elixir of

me at one time so common that the ancient
philosophers would have spurned the sug-
gestion of changing the elements to manu-
facture it

but we cannot be content with the result
of this experiment he cautioned the nein-
ians we must build many more machines
at once we must fill oar little lake with
water and many more besides it will be
generations before there is enough water to
repopulate the earth even at the fastest rate
that we can manufacture it

friend or foe

the four men that constituted the crew
of the power house in space flying per-
petually around the earth but free of its
dimming atmospheres were able to see great
distances with their telescopes continually
they swept the heavens for amusement and
for their scientific enlightenment relieving
the enforced monotony of their tasks by
speculating on the enormousness of space
and the mysteries of astronomy

every two hours they made a complete
circuit of the earth by the time they had
been suspended in space a week they had
examined minutely all the neighboring bod-
ies that came within the range of their in-
struments and now eagerly sought the skies
for new worlds to observe counting the in-
numerable comets that time and again swept
in toward the mighty sun or hastened out-
ward from it they spied asteroids that had
never been seen from earths surface because
of the denseness of the atmosphere they
watched with amazement the continual fiery
displays that accompanied the falling of
swift-moving meteors into the blanket of air
surrounding tellus

but in all this phenomena they beheld
but one object that alarmed them the
natural bodies of space moving in relation
to each other in accordance with the inex-
orable laws of the universe were calculable
explicable but one object which at first
they thought to be an approaching comet
then an asteroid and finally a heavenly body
the like of which had never been sighted
before caused them to bend their energies
full upon it whenever their tiny satellite


wonder stories

was upon ike aide of die earth that permitted
them to view it

the thing was at first only a speck of
light-a spark moving in the darkness of
space as it approached they thought they
detected a slight train like that of a small
comet but soon this illusion gave way to
the certainty that here was no ordinary body
but one that by its actions appeared to be
controlled by intelligent beings

having reached this conclusion they were
for a time at a loss how to proceed if it
were indeed an approaching space-car it
might be bringing beings from another plan-
et totally unknown to them perhaps intelli-
gent creatures from worlds beyond the ken
of men inhabiting the solar system but-
and this was a possibility that appeared to
them more rational-the approaching ship
might bear friends with word of neina or
it might be bringing enemies from pleida
who had been apprised of the old mans pro-
ject upon tell us and had come to destroy it
and the scientists with it

this last consideration was one to be reck-
oned with seriously for the expedition ex-
pecting no hostile life upon the planet they
had come to visit had brought virtually no
arms or other means of defense bent on
a mission of peace they had chosen to util-
ize every precious inch of space and ounce of
weight in their ship for transporting ob-
jects chemicals materials and instruments
useful and necessary to that project

the four members of the power-house
crew waited until gazing through their glass-
es they were morally certain that they had
made no mistake that it was indeed a space-
ship that approached through the inky heav-
ens they perceived that it was traveling
at a furious rate exceeding even that at
which the ship of the scientists had come
to tellus

they sent a message to the camp of- the
scientists upon the earth telling what they
had seen in a few minutes word had been
taken to the old tellurian and he had come
personally to the radiophone to question
them

they are already within the orbit of
luna the moon the power-house crew re-
ported within a few hours at this rate

they will be dose enough to make a land-
ing

the old man alarmed to think what might
happen to bis water machine and its re-
plica now nearly finished and to the whole
project if it were now attacked by a detep-
mined foe questioned them at length

are there more than one he queried

the observers replied in the negative
we can see only one the leader returned
it is a ship that bears no colors or other
distinguishing mark that we can perceive
at this distance

is it a pleidan ship

it does not appear so-but we cannot
be sure

then it might possibly be a neinian
ship

it is possible

a few minutes later the speed of the sate-
llite power-house swept it out of sight of
the approaching flyer and its crew could
report no further upon it

he whole camp on tellus was suddenly
in an uproar when the old scientist
turned from the radiophone he found that
the news of approaching beings perhaps
enemies had spread like a blaze through dry
grass the technicians and scientists were
waiting for him beseeching demanding
the chief engineer of their own craft had
suggested that they re-enter and speed away
before the strangers arrived he had point-
ed out that there was no means of defense
and counselled flight as the only sane course

one group was for digging entrenchments
and throwing up a breastwork behind which
they would be safe from hostile rays that
might be sprayed upon them from the un-
known craft others were for scattering in-
to the hills bearing food with them to await
developments

the old man gazed at them sadly while
they brought these proposals successively to
his attention and when they were through
he held up his hand for silence

it is growing late he pointed out the
sun is even now approaching the horizon
and soon it will be night here if this craft
is seeking us be it loaded either with friends
or enemies it will not know where to find
the return from jupiter



us for many hours until daylight again re-
veals our position

meanwhile unless it takes up an orbital
course around the earth as we did when
building the power-house its speed will
force a landing long before that time the
chances are a million to one that it will
strike the surface of tellus miles from where
we stand perhaps on the other side of the
globe it is likely in fact that we shall
sleep tonight and many nights undisturbed
-that they will land at such a distance that
we shall never hear of them except through
the eyes of our revolving power-house
when they heard these words the neinians
somewhat recovered from their alarm the
old man went on

there is another contingency which none
of you appear to have thought of he de-
clared perhaps these men now approach-
ing earth are friends instead of enemies
eager to give us news of neitia-perhaps
news of vital importance to us we there-
fore cannot take a chance on their missing
us we must take steps at once to attract
their attention so that they will be sure to
land nearby whether it is dark or light
at this the neinians were filled with mur-
murings and uneasiness again that
would be suicide one exclaimed sup-
pose they were pleidans we have abso-
lutely no means of defense against them
the old mans lips parted so that his lips
flashed in the last rays of the yellow sun-
light but there was no smile upon his face
are you neinians-or children he de-
manded do you believe that i have not
reckoned the dangers it is my project
after all that must fail if i have calculated
wrongly about these strangers from space
i say we must signal them

but if they are enemies-

then we have such weapons as had the
first men who battled with stones sticks
fists and teeth upon this globe and if all
else fails-we can still reason with them
why should it benefit any citizen of the
universe to undo what we have begun to ac-
complish here whether they are neinians
or pleidans they can only rejoice to see the
rehabilitation of a planet which may some

day yield their own kind a home neighbors
in space commerce

with such logic he swayed them pre-
sently even the most fearful of the neinans
joined him in the proposal to build a signal
pyre

they selected a spot more than five miles
distant from the neinian camp where crude
huts now surrounded the industrious water
machine and its silent brother not yet in
operation the old man led them through
the rolling hills until about dark they came
to a spot level and open enough for the
landing of a space car yet somewhat lower
than the surrounding country so that no
matter how the strangers should arrive the
little garrison of neinians would be above
them on the hillsides

in the valley they heaped a huge pile of
the dry tinder-like ancient wood while other
members of the band piled up the loose
stones of the hillsides to form temporary
fortifications and vantage points from which
huge boulders might be rolled upon un-
wary strangers should they prove hostile
such weapons as they had they distributed
among themselves knives short deadly
neinian gas-pistols hammers and other
blunt tools that might be used in hand-to-
hand encounter and finally sharpened sticks
such as shepherds might carry as protection
against snakes or badgers

chapter xii

the coming of the stranger

it was while they were thus engaged that
they first saw through their own teles-
copes the approaching monster in space
at first they beheld only a blurred spark in
the heavens seemingly infinitely distant
but the space-cars approach was swift
steadily it grew until they beheld the fur-
ious fire of the nose rockets that was check-
ing its speed then it appeared like a met-
eorite with cries of surprise and apprehen-
sion the neinians saw it apparently burst
into flame but in a moment they recognized
it as an illusion

the approaching car had now begun to
fall into the landing maneuvers necessary for


wonder stories

alighting on any planet with such dense at-
mosphere as that of tellus they saw it
plunge toward the horizon like a setting
star and for more than two hours they saw
nothing more of it some to whom the sight
of the ship actually hovering over them had
brought back all their fear of an attack by
hostile forces breathed easier at this be-
lieving that perhaps the old mans deduc-
tions had been correct that the strange craft
had indeed fallen to the surface on the other
side to trouble them no more

but as quickly as it had disappeared it
rose again having made a complete circle
of the earth and now they saw that it was
considerably closer having lost much of its
speed and at the same time lessened its al-
titude

now is the time for our beacon fire
said the old tellurian with a tense voice
light the pyre

in a minute the flames were eating hun-
grily at the time-dried wood burning with
such brilliance in the rich oxygen of the
atmosphere that the whole glade was almost
instantly lighted up as if by a magnesium
flare the neinians who had not intended
to expose themselves scurried for cover
hastening to their rough piles of rocks
ready to meet the invader whether friend or
foe

they had not long to wait with whist-
ling wings and a fountain of fire bursting
from rockets at its head the craft was upon
them it came toward the lighted spot like
a comet fire flying outward from it there
was a heavy impact the plowed earth shook
as if clutched in the grip of a distant tem-
blor the fire was scattered mingling its
sparks with the gigantic display from the
rockets head then in an instant every-
thing was quiet and nearly dark

the neinians waited tense for some sign
of life about the craft they heard the
movements of the occupants the huge
doors of the air-lock were heard to grate
open in the darkness the scientists held
to each other in paroxysms of dread what
grotesque figures might now be issuing
forth into the tellurian night neinians
pleidans or perhaps creatures of a world
beyond the system of the sun of forms and

shapes unknown perhaps - horribte
thought-these creatures had a sense ol
sight not dependent upon light but upon
some other radiation that they were even
now being observed though they could not
see their observers

there was a crunching upon the dry soil
of the glade in which the space-ship had
come to rest embers of the scattered fire
stepped upon by some heavy body glowed
suddenly in a brief moment of renewed life
and expired in a small shower of impotent
sparks

there had certainly been creatures not
unlike neinian pleidan or tellurian men
in the ship now they were outside it
groping in the darkness to survey the sur-
face of the planet upon which they had
found a resting place after so long a jour-
ney

the waiting neinians heard the old tel-
lurian shout his rallying cry it was the
signal they had been waiting for in an in-
stant they were all upon their feet rushing
toward the strange craft with their weap-
ons such as they were ready for the fray
if one were necessary taking the strangers
by surprise

the old mans electric torch suddenly
stabbed into the darkness before him a
dozen other strong beams likewise appeared
there was a confused babel of voices in the
hollow around the belly of the giant craft
whose huge bulk now lay outlined against
the stars

who are you came a wavering cry
we come as friends

still the neinians made no answer but
closed in relentlessly too long used to
dealing with a crafty foe to fail to recognize
this trap

the first torch reached the strangers who
had withdrawn to their craft and were lined
up against it their retreat to the air-lock and
safety cut off by the quick attack of the
neinians breathlessly the old man of tel-
lus ran his pencil of light from one face to
another then he uttered a cry the lead-
er of this craft of which they had all been
afraid was old alius

he stood in the torch-light with his en-
the return from jupiter



gineers uncertain who was attacking him
his hands were empty a the neinians
who had come in the second craft were un-
armed

instantly the tenseness and apprehension
of the last few hours dissolved in celebra-
tion and exclamations of welcome

but the old tellurian and old alius
looked at each other gravely

your water machine asked the head
of the house o alius in an eager whisper
you have succeeded in-setting it up
yes it works

works you have created water then
the old tellurian nodded gravely the
erstwhile ruler of neina held out a wither-
ed trembling hand deiminos help us
he said in a tragic beaten voice you have
saved tellus but neina-neina is lost des-
pite all we could do

neina lost and what of nina the
tellurians grip tightened spasmodically
have you brought her with you to safety
here

i could not said old alius hollowly
she loves alius marce and when he would
not listen she remained against my will to
try defending neina alone but as we
swept up from that tragic earth to warn you
of neinas fate i saw that she-had failed
for want of alius marces help

it was the turn of the old man facing
him to grow hoarse to whisper now what
has become of hst alius tell me-what
did they do with her

deiminos forgive me-forgive us all i
do not know

new ancienda

the two patriarchs walked together
through the hills from the landing place
of old alluss space-craft to the new colony
of the neinians beside the ancient lake

morning had come from the east stream-
ed the first bright rays of the rising sun with
such brilliance that old alius whose eyes
had not become accustomed to the nearness
of the mother of planets even through his
long journey from neina was forced to
blink and shade his face with a withered
hand as they topped the last rise the nein-

ian saw below him a sight as strange and
weird as any to be found in the solar sys-
tem the first colony founded upon a barren
and deserted planet by men who sought to
rehabilitate it

before them was a small cluster of gray
shacks made by matching together in crude
fashion the aged dry logs with which the
region abounded beyond them in the great
hollow there now lay a small body of shim-
mering water spread out thinly over the
surface of the extinct lake steaming a little
at one edge where the stream from the water
machine was pouring into it cool and quiet
elsewhere

already though scarcely two weeks had
passed since the neinians had alighted there
the settlement was taking on the marks of
human habitation unaccustomed feet had
worn paths in the rude street between the
houses not far away the reflector that
caught energy mysteriously from the skies
was moving in its diurnal gyrations in con-
stant contact with the waves arriving from
the power-house in space

the neinian scientists their fears of in-
vasion allayed were going about their busi-
ness with bustle and energy fires were
glowing in the impromptu laboratory and
shop they had set up for the manufacture
of new water machines to aid the original
in its gargantuan task hammers were
ringing on metal wire was being drawn by
expert hands according to methods in use
since time immemorial glass was being
fused of materials found nearby on tellus
already the huge new tube of the second
water machine its electrodes in place was
being exhausted of air preparatory to being
set in place upon the trestle waiting for it
at the side of the growing lake

this view old alius took in with surprised
admiring eyes when he saw the water he
could hardly suppress an exclamation for
at the edges of the new lake showing faintly
in the morning light there were unmistaka-
ble traces of green-the first sprouts of
plants just thrusting their eager way through
the long-barren earth

where did you get them asked the old
neinian have you brought seeds from
neina to plant on tellus


wonder stories

the tellurian sihiled it was not nec-
essary he replied the plants sprung
up spontaneously i was as startled as any
three days ago when i first discovered them
there seeds lying in the soil-who knows
how many years-have already tasted of
our new water and found it good the
earth was lying ready for this new machine
of mine and rewards us for bringing water
back where it has so long been dry

it is a miracle declared the neinian
perhaps all the earth is watching this small
handful of men at work here watching
quietly and waiting ready to spring into
bloom when the time comes

the old tellurian spoke fervently i
hope so-i know so we can bring back
many of the plants that carpeted old tel-
lus-his voice saddened-but as for the
animals we must repopulate the globe with
animals from some other world aside
from bacteria i doubt if any living crea-
tures have survived

the two old men who not many months
before had been filled with bold plans and
high hopes suddenly fell silent at that re-
flecting upon the innumerable implications
of this proposed migration from earth to
earth especially upon the difficulties that
now faced it with neina in the hands of
her enemies and the peoples of the satellites
leaderless and enslaved

they walked down the short slope that
separated them from the village they
passed the gleaming space-car that had
brought the tellurian and his crew at
length they entered the one crooked street
of the settlement upon which was centered
the hope of a world and a civilization

in honor of neina and the house of al-
ius said the old tellurian we have named
it-new ancienda

new ancienda

the tellurian saw tears glistening in old
alius eyes and hastened on realizing how
the old man must be wrung by memories of
his satellite awakened by this name

it will be a prosperous city in due time
the man of earth declared as our supply
of water increases the main body of thd
people will have to migrate farther and

farther south to escape the cold climates
of these latitudes new ancienda is the
first city of the new world in it all op-
pressed peoples in the universe will be for-
ever welcome

but are you generating enough water to
support a city here

when new machines have been set up-
larger and more efficient than the original
we will fill this lake in a fortnight

but you lose a great deal by evapora-
tion

that will not be a serious trouble after
the first year or so in a sense it will be
an aid to our speedy renewal of life on
earth for what goes up into the atmos-
phere as vapor will come down to land
again as rain the old man grew thought-
ful already we have had a condensation
of moisture here he confided as though
discussing a miracle yesterday morning
there was a slight dew on the ground near
the edges of the lake and in the afternoon
we beheld a small cloud-perhaps no bigger
than a robe but none the less a cloud-
floating over our pool

the tellurian was animated enthusiastic
over these small manifestations that herald-
ed the return of age-old earthly phenomena
we had a cloud old alius-the first seen
here it may be in years

when we have sufficient water we will
lay out a farm on the flat yonder the tel-
lurian was saying a little later when they
had surveyed the town and examined the
marvelous machines that were transforming
the atmosphere into water next spring we
will plant some of the seeds we have brought
from neina and by mid-summer a year
from now we will be able to care for a
great many-

he went on in a rambling fashion talk-
ing to old alius but both of them knew
that the big question was yet to be decided
with neina under the domination of pleida
how could any of her inhabitants be res-
cued

he explained that another site in a neigh-
boring valley farther to the south had al-
ready been selected for the next village
they would have a lake there too within
a few months rough houses could be
the return from jupiter



quickly thrown together pending the erec-
tion of more permanent dwellings when
there were more hands to aid in the work

you have planned it well old alius
commented dryly

it will take years returned the tellur-
ian to tnake the earth support any con-
siderable population at this rate it will
take generations centuries-maybe to the
end of time-to restore her to the condition
in which she once rejoiced but the people
of neina are few compared to the ancient
population of tellus wars pestilences the
coming of the cold-many things have re-
duced them in numbers so that now in all
neina there are hardly more than once oc-
cupied a large city of the ancient earth

the people of neina can find refuge here
within a year and it will take that long to
transport them as the condition of the
earth permits they can increase and multi-
ply until tellus is re-peopled by the des-
cendants of the great houses of your satel-
lite

and nina daughter of the last of the
tellurians-if she still lives  

at this mention the old mans voice which
had been filled throughout his discussion
with a kind of forced gaiety and optimism
broke with the brief and apprehension he
had felt since old alius had brought him
word of neinas downfall the neinian pat-
riarch caught him by the shoulders they
stood together besidtthe new still lake with
the tiny green sprouts coming up from
earth about their feet

te are old men murmured old ai-
  lus softly we are men upon whom
age wears heavily would deiminos our
work were done but it is not we must
yet achieve that without which all your ef-
forts and accomplishments here are worth-
less   

for a long minute neither spoke the
aged tellurian with the aid of that inner
strength which had given fire to his ancient
joints and inspired the neinians to prodi-
gious labors in the flight through space re-
gained control of himself quietly he beat
down the weakness that had made him mo-
mentarily betray himself before his friend

he put out his hand firmly and seized that
of old alius whose eyes were downcast
whose lips trembled whose robes of state
and pomp were stained with the dust of a
strange planet

neinas people can be saved said the
tellurian but it will require a sacrifice
alius how much are you willing to give
to see your son and my daughter and their
subjects safe and happy on this globe
the patriarch spread impotent hands
alas he replied dejectedly i have lived
a long life and i am now near the end of it
a year ago i might have given much but
now i have nothing-not even the honor
and respect of my former subjects for i
am an outcast and in the very act of my
coming to bring warning and news to you
i have branded myself as a coward and
covered the ancient and honorable name of
alius with shame

i have to be specific with you a ser-
viceable space-craft and its loyal crew your
friendship and this frail remnant of my
wretched life if it is possible to help the
people of neina by the sacrifice of any-or
all-of these i stand ready at your sug-
gestion

the tellurian considered briefly

then we will leave as many men here to
continue the work as we can spare and pro-
ceed to neina

the man of earth was himself again as
he led the way to the workshop he gave
swift directions for the loading of the space-
craft the re-charging of its oxygen tanks
the replenishing of the water supply

before the sun had set the two great rock-
ets were ready for the return journey to the
satellite from which they had been launched
as soon as darkness made the taking of
bearings by the stars more certain they
were off two fountains of fire hurrying out-
ward from the earth

looking back they beheld the huge bea-
con which the crew remaining on earth had
built for their farewell flying by them
far to the south they examined through
their telescopes the giant reflector whose
faithful transmission of the suns fierce heat
made possible the generation of water at the
camp below

chapter xiii
a nation enslaved

the cool blue daylight of neina filtered
across the open spaces of the great plaza
before the palace of alius ancienda-
once the most beautiful city of the satellite
-lay beneath the summer sun her streets
no longer clean and bright her people no
longer free and happy for more than the
space of a tellurian year the heavy yoke of
pleida had been upon the satellite and in
their squalid quarters her citizens cowered
in horror awaiting their turn to be beaten
to the street and driven to the frightful
platinum mines

every day at dawn long lines of them fed
scantily at filthy kitchens administered by
the pleidan authorities marched dolefully
like members of a chain gang through the
square the whippers of dolmician went
with them walking on either side their
long lashes going like pistol shots over the
heads of the captives the road led through
the citys main streets to the open country
and thence to the horrible mines in which
the neinians died by the score scourged to
their work until exhaustion overcame them

the neinians without exception were
shabby mostly clad in rags some wrap-
ped around their chilled bodies torn pieces
of cloth taken from ore-sacks others had
sheets or blankets that also were the beds
upon which they slept at night all were
miserable hopeless

disease had repeatedly ravaged their
ranks the cruelties of dolmicians men
had covered them with scars and deformi-
ties many of the women during the fright-
ful twelve months since ninas and alius
marces failure to save the satellite had gone
to unspeakable fates repeatedly the squat
frog-like pleidan soldiers had seized the
fairer ones out of the marching ranks some-
times dishonoring them even in public while
the poor wretches cried out for help from
their impotent husbands or lovers in the
enslaved ranks many such ended their
sufferings voluntarily in the misery of the
platinum pits after the pleidans had cast
them aside again

so it was with fear and terror that the
long line formed each morning to parade
through the plaza toward the mines but
this morning as they moved past they be
held a sign that caused many to cry out in
horror despite the callousness their plight
had cast upon them since the day of the
capture nina and alius marce had been
singled out by the pleidans for torture and
cruelty they had been sent to work under
heavy guard in the deepest levels of the
mines they had been beaten starved sub-
jected to indignities and cruelty

but today the leaders were no longer in
the weaving line instead the enslaved
neinians beheld that in the center of the
plaza a platform had been erected over-
night on the platform was a post and
upon this structure their toes scarcely
touching the floor beneath their arms up-
raised and fastened with thongs were the
two persons all neina reverenced today
after more than a year of slavery in the
mines the satellites two leaders had been
set up upon a torture-pedestal to be a spec-
tacle

instantly when they had seen it a mur-
mur of questioning and protest arose in the
neinian ranks disregarding the threats
of their drivers they paused to see this new
horror what could be the meaning of it
what great occasion were the pleidan sol-
diers now planning that nina and alius
marce had been brought from their daily
torture to be subjected to this indignity

a whisperscurried through the smitten
crowd it could mean but one thing the
long-deferred visit of the great dolmician
emperor of pleida and her satellites dol-
mician was coming to take up his summer
quarters on pleida bringing with him new
and stronger armies to garrison the satel-
lite he had ordered the public shaming
of the leaders of neina to add to the tri-
umph of his arrival perhaps he would
later order them to be publicly tortured
perhaps put to cruel death high on the gib-
bet in the plaza

allus marce they could see was bear-

-	ing the ordeal defiantly a faint smile
was on his pale face his teeth were set
the return from jupiter



nina the tellurian lacked his strength
of body but made up for it in fiery resent-
ment toward her captors her deep black
hair hung down her back as she stood there
her head forcibly turned away from alius
marce her eyes were hollow with sad-
ness but behind them a light not of neina
but of tellus looked out a gleam of fury
and self-reliance which the pleidans had
been unable to interpret

never the neinian throngs thought with
pity had this strange woman from another
planet looked more beautiful never had the
metal of her soul been clearer to see her for-
titude and bravery more on display

but they were not permitted to gaze long
the guards themselves taken aback for a
moment at the strangeness and brutality of
the sight in the plaza applied themselves
anew to their bitter daily task the whips
cracked women screamed the plaza
rang with shouts lamentations curses the
line a long gray snake moved on it
filed past the foot of the platform upon
which the sufferers were silent while the
people went by

the sun was rising casting its pale rad-
iance upon them lovingly beneath the plat-
form stood two guards nina tied with her
back to alius marce in such a way that
they could not see each other spoke softly
murmuring words of fortitude and strength

alius marce who had been for a long
time silent sighed profoundly

it would have been better to have died
he said at length it would have been
finer to have had my space-ship torn open
to have felt the icy kiss of space it would
have been better to die even in the cold
frightful mines we have too much strength
nina

she quieted him speaking again softly
marce she said do not lose heart yet

nina-you are so brave i was a proud
fool the day you showed me how to save
neina

her voice when she replied to this con-
fession was filled with compassion my
marce- she paused momentarily then
went on again-you have learned humility
and wisdom since then we shall think no
more of it look to the future marce

the future fie smiled bitterly

everything is lost now even my courage
far off they heard the shouts of the driv-
ers flailing the neinians many had been
set aside for punishment for real or fancied
infractions or as a warning to the miserable
race that toiled in the mines they heard
the groans and screams of the victims writh-
ing in the torture they heard the gleeful
barking of the dog-like animals that al-
ways attended these daily autos-da-fe -i
neinas scavengers hoping for an oppor-
tunity to satisfy their appetites with the
blood of the miserable souls who suffered
there

again nina started the conversation
my father has never failed she murmur-
ed if there is any way at all he will res-
cue us

he replied bitterly so a little while
ago would i have spoken of my father but
in our nations direst extremity he has for-
saken us

perhaps he went for help

from whom in all the universe there
is not one world willing to help neina who
fought for the freedom of all

the coming of dolmician

there had suddenly sounded from the
streets below the song of unmuted
trumpets the thunder of great drums the
clash of brass cymbals the garrison of
the pleidans was assembling hastily sol-
diers came running from their barracks for-
saking their gambling and drinking near
and far throughout the city were heard the
atrocious stridulations the pleidans regard-
ed as martial music the troops stung by
the barbarous rhythms began forming in
long lines across the plaza

looking upward nina and alius marce
beheld the purpose of these preparations
already in the blue distance of the daytime
sky the approaching fleet of dolmician
could be seen the wasp-like convoy craft
flanking the huge space-barge which was the
royal ship of the fat emperor

it was true then after all dolmician was
coming throughout the city and even into
the deeps of the grisly mines went a kind


wonder stories

of premonitory shiver the pleidan sol-
diers felt it-so did the neinian wretches
whom they had enslaved dolmician
whose cruelty was the talk of five worlds
whose sordid revelries outranked the tawdry
displays even of the fat monarchs whose
heir he was

what changes would he make in this en-
slaved satellite once he had taken up resi-
dence there for the warm season as was
the custom of kings since time immemorial

the man and woman waiting for him on
the wooden platform saw the approaching
space-ships as a man might gaze upon an evil
destiny whatever might befall the other
neinians the arrival of dolmician could
mean nothing less than torture and probably
death for them how quickly or how slow-
ly would depend on the mood of dolmician
if he felt sportive they might be kept alive
in torture for days weeks perhaps even
months if he came angry he might be
more quick therefore more merciful

once-twice the swift ships swooped over
the waiting city the soldiers were all in
place now guarding the path their emperor
would take from the great public landing
field to the palace of alius the proces-
sional cars were already drawn up waiting
for him the musicians waited nervously
and salvarius carde in whose hands the rule
of the satellite had been placed pending
dolmicians arrival strode up and down
trying to hide his feelings beneath a cloak
of impatience

a third time the fleet of the emperor
passed overhead in its landing maneuvers
much lower now a fourth and fifth the
foremost ship swooped suddenly to the
ground-struck with a grinding shock 

the others followed settling in formation
with the huge craft that carried dolmician
safe in the middle instantly the bands
struck up blowing as if the fate of the em-
pire depended upon the volume of their 
music slaves in bright green costumes un-
rolled a long strip of red carpet of a mater-
ial like plush which reached from the lar-
gest of the golden street cars to the door of
dolmicians ship

doors opened with deafening clangs
guards from the planet appeared pouring

forth to assist and protect the emperor
the soldiers not to be restrained in their
attempt to add further to the din raised a
shout of welcome and adulation

last of all swinging outward on noise-
less hinges the door of the huge royal craft
was opened the courtiers came through it
first in their brilliant colored robes then
came the court women and the concubines
the pages the scientists of the court there
was a pause at last out stepped dolmi-
cian walking with the aid of his staff of
authority assisted by two guards one at
either side

the orgulous splendor of this arrival was
such as to dazzle the eyes of all beholders
through the now gaping door of the royal
craft came a prodigious beam of golden
light playing on the back of the emperor
with such brilliance that even in the day-
light he seemed to be the molten misshapen
embodiment of it his hands arms face
and belly seemed to drip golden motes of
light the radiance poured around him
fondling him

so overcome were the ignorant pleidan
spectators by this theatrical device that
many of them whof had never before seen
the emperor fell down upon their faces be-
fore the effulgence which they believed to
pour from him

dolmician entered the car the beam
disappeared but now he sat on a high
dais surrounded by his courtiers and wo-
men in robes of heavy gold and platinum
upon his head rested the massive crown of
the five-world empire its jewels flashing in
the sun

salvarius carde gave a command arising
from his kneeling posture in the dust by
the side of the rich carpet his emperor had
trod the bands which had momentarily
faltered in their outpourings began again
the procession started throughthe streets
while the soldiers trained for such cere-
monies cheered until their throats went
hoarse and rent their bright uniforms to
make flags to wave at dolmician

the first of the great cars moved into the
plaza the second came close after it
straight across the open space they went
the return from jupiter



toward the great entrance to the palace of
alius the course passing through the
double lines of soldiers marking it out led
them directly past the wooden platform upon
which stood nina and alius marce

dolmician perceived them from a dis-
tance he saw how cruelly they had been
trussed up in his honor how the thongs cut
their flesh how the post made them com-
panions in misery yet prevented them the
comfort of seeing each other in their tor-
ture

who are these he demanded jovially
of salvarius carde who rose alongside

alius marce-the princeling of neina
who dared to stand against you-and the
tellurian girl nina who conspired with
him

but what of old alius and the old tel-
lurian i had thought also to have a spec-
tacle of them in honor of my visit

alas great emperor we have not yet
captured the old fox and his tellurian ad-
viser they have escaped into space where
both may be flying even now into the hot
face of the sun for aught we know

hah the emperor frowned i had
planned to have a spectacle of them his
face experienced his sudden displeasure

salvarius carde bowed as deeply as his
mount would permit i am sorry he
said they escaped before we took the
satellite else you should have had them

dolmicians anger for a moment twisted
his features

you will search for them he command-
ed darkly if you have to ransack all space
i will have a spectacle of those two old
men

salvarius carde bowed deeply again
without answering reflecting bitterly but
silently upon the unreasonableness of mon
archs

but dolmician was in too fine a mood
to be long downcast a second glance at
the torture-post of nina and alius marce
restored his good spirits when we get
abreast of them he ordered the proces-
sion must come to a halt i will question
these two i will decide here and now what
shall be done with them

chapter xiv
the return to neina

the birds of neina circled over a small
deserted isle in the sea not many miles
from ancienda uttering wild cries of alarm
fortunately there were no pleidans or nein-
ians in the neighborhood to hear them for
the party from tellus had alighted secretly
there

it was a barren and secluded part of the
satellite one of a number of rocky islands
that gave no ground for inhabitants because
of the nature of the soil and the character
of the vegetation

a little back from the coast the two huge
rocket-ships that had borne them lay in a
narrow valley one behind the other the
walls of the vale were sufficiently high to
hide the craft from chance voyagers on the
surface of the turbulent chilly sea their
upper surfaces had been camouflaged by the
occupants who had cut and spread over
them piles of bushes navigators in the air
above the island would have flown past
without an inkling that below them rested
two such space-ships so cleverly had they
been concealed amid the scrubby growths of
the surrounding hillsides and valleys

seven days had passed since their arrival
there now inside the foremost rocket two
old men sat in the control cabin and talked
of space and science and philosophy touch-
ing on everything except that which was up-
permost in their minds a week earlier an
exploration party had been dispatched to
the mainland to learn what had transpired
since the coming of the pleidans now the
party was coming back again watches sta-
tioned on the hills had seen the boat pull out
from the mainland shore had seen it labor-
ing in the waves of the ocean that surround-
ed their retreat most of the occupants of
the two space-ships were already congrega-
ting on thebeach ready to receive the news
and hurry it to the leaders in the craft

but the two old men were holding aloof
as if for them no problems existed except
philosophical ones they were talking of
the behavior of kings and princes of his-
tory and deeds of heroism


wonder stories

it was the custom of the generals and
rulers of earth to avoid danger they fol-
lowed their armies rather than led them
or stayed in pompous palaces and received
messages from the battle by relay and elect-
ricity said thfe old tellurian taking up
again a topic that had afforded them many
hours of discussion already during the
weary days

and by what curious tellurian sophistry
did they justify that asked the neinian

it was believed-and this they often put
forth in their own defense-that the ruler
of a nation or the leader of an army is more
important by far than any or all the mem-
bers of the body over which he had com-
mand therefore it was more wise for him
to remain out of danger while his subjects
died than for him to plunge into the battle
himself or to otherwise risk his skin

a quaint idea answered old alius
tasting the words slowly i can half grant
its truth in the case of a general who must
remain where he can direct but as for
your kings princes presidents-the men
who declared the wars or by whose awk-
wardness or ineptness the danger came
did they not go out to the battle line and
show the way by example or greater still
expose themselves to extreme danger such
as no common soldier among their armies
would dare in order to assure victory
the old man of earth smiled not at
all he admitted i am afraid our kings
and presidents were made of no such met-
tle they took the position rather that
they were the country being the figurehead
and symbol of its government that the sol-
diers were fighting to protect them as it
was in the ancient game of chess all places
on the board must be ready for supreme
sacrifice to save the king

ahh-

the neinian was silent for a long time
the door of the room stood open be-
yond it through the airlock they could see
the ground outside covered with bushes
sloping toward the hillside in the distance
there was a burst of shouting as if the frail
boat from the mainland had at length come
ashore neither of the old men moved at

the sound but old alius resumed his talk-
ing picking up the conversation abruptly
as if its lagging had just occurred to him

have you ever heard he asked leaning
toward his companion across the table that
separated them the story of alius svegus
my grandfather eight times removed who
was disgraced before his people through no
fault of his own but who redeemed himself
by an act of such stupendous bravery that
though it cost his life it won back a world
and made his people free

the tellurian was silent alius went on
without an answer there was another al-
ius too more recently who- but i need
not tell you specific instances kings princ-
es heads of great houses among us have al-
ways been ready-willing to sacrifice them-
selves when danger threatened their peo-
pie-

the tellurian nodded solemnly a babel
of voices was drawing nearer to the space-
craft the watchers on the beach were re-
turning with the members of the reconnoiter-
ing expedition their voices were high with
excitement still the old men ignored their
approach they were looking into each oth-
ers eyes and seeing understanding there

suddenly the tellurian rose and took old
alius firmly by the hand

there was an old story among us he
said softly of a great leader taking his
people from wilderness into life who climb-
ed a high mountain and saw the promised
land but was destined never to enter into
it-

his voice came suddenly to a pause the
messengers were already at the door clam-
oring to tell what they had learned

alius was first to question them his
voice steady enough a moment before now
began to tremble his face was filled with
eagerness tell me he asked what is
the state of my beloved ancienda what
did you see when first you made your way
into the city that was foremost on the satel-
lite

we saw people beaten shamed publicly
tortured in the streets women degraded be-
fore their men the city a shambles the
swine of pleida occupying the fine apart-
ments once reserved only for the nobles of
the return from jupiter



neina their leader spoke for them the
others nodding silently

and-what of alius marce

it was the tellurian who had asked the
second question those who had just re-
turned noted that his voice trembled also
this question they knew lay next to the
one he had so far refrained from asking
though it was on his heart

we saw him-standing upon a kind of
gibbet in the great plaza to be mocked by
the pleidans and shamed before his people

and nina for a moment the ans-
wer did not come the leader of the expe-
dition the old man saw was loath to speak

ifhere is she

master-she is a public example with
alius marce this day they took her out
with him to stand strung up by the hands
before the groaning slaves of neina the
pleidans spat upon them and defiled them
with words and shouting 

the message

at this the other neinians put their
heads down and murmured fearing for
the old tellurians reason for they saw a
strange expression come into his face

a prisoner

yes

then she is still alive she is at least
alive the tellurian cried it out i have
still something to fight for and to live for
in this universe

he was like a man suddenly released from
a dungeon in which he had been long im-
prisoned the neinians stared at him
amazed for to a neinian nothing even death
could be worse than public disgrace yet
here was this tellurian in transports of re-
lief and gladness

now it is time for us to strike he ex-
claimed now we must liberate ancien-
da

but you do not understand the scout
leader exclaimed in return dolmician is
here-on neina his soldiers are as the
leaves of grass he has taken up residence
here it was for his triumphal coming that
alius marce and the tellurian girl were
placed in the plaza it was that he might

see them there and judge them and mete out
punishment upon them as he saw fit
dolmician dolmician here the
old tellurian puckered up his lips as
though he were about to whistle but no
sound came forth so he went on and
what was his judgment upon the two when
he beheld them in the plaza

at first he mocked them calling out
questions while the crowd roared with laugh-
ter i hear he said that the father of one
of you was a cowardly jackal-dog of the
other a nanny-goat that ran of fright now
tell me which is which

they would not answer so he tried
again i hear that one of you is a great
space-soaring eagle who loses battles in the
air and the other is a blind-mole who tun-
nels in the earth and loses nevertheless on
the ground now tell me again which one
of you is which which is the woman and
which is the suckling pig

with that they did not answer again and
the emperor pretended great anger at their
incivility where are the whippers he
cried are they to stand by and see my
most civil questions go unheeded 

and then-

the whippers came running from the
ranks and curled their long lashes against
the bodies of the two tied to the post
then did they answer

master neither would cry out or answer
or beg mercy as dolmician expected i
saw blood run from the torn skin of nina
but she did not flinch from the lash in-
stead she stared impassively at the emperor
as if she were stone and he an object of no
importance but alius marce smiled until
his white teeth showed between his lips but
he made no sound

then dolmician held up his hand to
stop it they shall not be whipped to
death he commanded it is too easy for
them instead let them be brought out into
the plaza tomorrow and lashed to the pole
as they are now so that all neina may see
how merciful is dolmician to his enemies
the crowd roared again at this but dolmi-
cian commanded silence and when the
time is two hours past the middle of the
day he finished neina shall also see how


wonder stories

dolmician kills his enemies for i shall come
then to this same spot and show you new
tortures i have brought with me from
pleida

the tellurian was flushed with emotion
at the end of this recital proceed
he commanded tersely

the leader of the scouting party went on
there is little more when dolmician had
finished speaking the caravan drove on into
the portal of the palace of alius for it is
there masters that dolmician will make his
home meanwhile salvarius carde has
started search for both of you he has been
ordered to produce you before the emperor
even if it is necessary to fly through space
as far as the sun to catch you and bring
you back

but neither of the old men had heard the
leaders last remarks both were busy with
their thoughts

what do you say old alius the tel-
lurian demanded does dolmicians pres-
ence here defeat our plans is there no hope
now to save neina

the head of the house of alius straight-
ened his shoulders threw his proud old head
back he spoke to the neinians

we will send a message to nina and al-
ius marce and to all the people of neina
today he commanded to my son and
the tellurian girl you will transmit it wrap-
ped around this stone which is a piece of
red granite from the earth to the en-
slaved neinians you will transmit it by word
of mouth going into the mines and hovels all
through the night until all have received
it for the rest you must depend on me
he placed a gaunt hand upon the shoulder
of the silent tellurian

the message is this when the great pal-
ace of alius shall fly on the wind like
thistledown then you shall know that neina
is free that tellus awaits that help is at
hand

the neinian members of the expedition
hearing this looked at one another helpless-
ly but took the message nevertheless and
transmitted it

chapter xv

in his enemys hands

the great dolmician emperor of pleida
and her nine satellites sat amid his
courtiers and hangers-on in the palace of al-
ius at ancienda and reflected with lusty
pleidan distaste on the graceful almost
gothic beauty of the palaces and houses of
the leaders of neina

his own palace at nealoma capital city of
the planet was an enormous squat ramb-
ling structure built throughout of gleaming
stone richly and vulgarly ornamented with
patterns of gold silver and platinum it
was pretentious grotesque in its costly ug-
liness a hideous squat monument to the
cruelty lust and garish bad taste of a long
line of pleidan rulers it was such a pal-
acc that dolmician preferred but there was
nothing like it anywhere on the little satel-
lite and for the time being he had to be
content

he rested among cushions in the great in-
ner chamber his short ugly body decked
with raiment of many colors each signify-
ing some rank power or dominion usurped
either by himself or his ancestors his
head sat close upon his shoulders connected
by a thick neck as wide as his jowls his
haunches were heavy and his belly round
and bloated with too much easy living but
his face was the most unpleasant of all

his mouth was wide and thin-lipped par-
elleling the line of a pointed chin that con-
trived to twist his features into a continual
crafty grin even when it was in repose his
nose was short almost invisible the nos-
trils opened outward instead of downward
showing two breathing holes above his lips
like those of a horse it was his eyes that
betrayed his unending malice they were
small and piggish at the outer corners in-
numerable tiny wrinkles spread out fanwise
toward his temples

close beside him sat the court women on
their cushions the ones on either side of
him were his favorites they were fondling
him as he returned their caresses openly
caring nothing for the eyes of at least half
the return from jupiter



a hundred courtiers and attendants who sat
farther back

all were drinking the heavy greasy wine
of the pleidan court repugnant and over-
rich to other palates but considered a great
delicacy to all true pleidans dolmician
drank freely from a huge platinum bowl
which he held in one jeweled pudgy hand
the others had smaller cups

the platinum of neina he shouted
holding up his cup to be refilled the nob-
les and the women laughed responding to
his remark as to a toast here is a cup
that cost a good many worthless neinian
li vesl 

again they laughed it was a huge joke
among them the enslavement of the peoples
of the satellite

salvarius carde reports that he will
double their production by placing whippers
at every level in the mines shouted a court-
ier

the shipments are already being sent to
fill the royal metal houses another called
we shall have to transport a few thousand
slaves to nealoma to build new bins for
this neinian platinum

at these sallies the great dolmician half
drunk lay back upon his cushions and roar-
ed with heavy laughter we have caught
them all except the old tellurian and old
alius they put their tails between their
legs and ran away into space it would be
a good thing for them if the sun has got
them

a courtier laughed aye for if he
hasnt dolmician will in good time

another took up this line of boasting
which so pleased the emperor the
son of old alius is already strung up again
today in public for our men to spit upon
until time for the tortures

and the daughter of the old tellurian
whom he left behind is she out there too

she is master

dolmician half rose as if to go and see
them for himself but settled back again
chuckling	n

it yet lacks two hours of the appointed
time he observed i would not spoil the
soldiers fun by beginning before they had

assembled to watch dolmicians skill

at this the whole assemblage shouted with
laughter and appreciation but dolmician
waved them down his eyes sparkling and
shrewd i promise you he said that if
we catch the two old men it will not be the
soldiers that shall have all the fun well
have the cowardly old fools before us here
-and you shall observe in private how dol-
mician treats his special ancient enemies

outside the palace in the broad plaza a
great throng of pleidan soldiers had gath-
ered drawn together by some object of cur-
iosity anger or contempt some nucleus that
was moving slowly and steadily toward the
entrance of the great hall of the palace as
the object of its emotion advanced the crowd
also moved still surrounding the attraction
like phagocytes

that object was an old man a neinian
he had been beaten and robbed and he was
now suffering silently under the contemp-
tuous cries the epithets and the more phy-
sical insults of the pleidan crowd but like
a machine without emotions either of hat-
red or shame with only a dogged knowledge
of a thing that must be done and endless
determination to do it he was moving tow-
ard the palace and dolmician

it was old alius

on either side of him marched a member
of the pleidan civilian-police a kind of
home-guard soldier brought over for his own
protection by dolmician they were hold-
ing the old man roughly yet with a certain
respect despite the threatening attitude of
the crowd it was they who made it pos-
sible for him to proceed toward the palace
for they were opening the way ahead by the
continual threat of their weapons

old alius right hand was empty but in
the left he held a glistening black object en-
graved with a fine pattern of white metal and
embossed with the insignia of his house it
was a kind of amulet a symbol of authority
to hold it so in the palm of the left hand
lightly gripped was a token of truce or sur-
render assuring the wearer protection and
some position of respect while he sought an
official among his enemies with whom he
might parley or surrender himself as a pri-
soner


wonder stories

the noisy crowd with its silent kernel pro-
gressed along the street toward the palace
when they reached the huge open portal
through which a sloping stone hallway swept
toward the audience chamber old alius call-
ed a halt send in word he commanded
calmly in a low voice tell dolmician
that old alius is here to seek sanctuary with
him he will be glad to hear from me

a messenger was dispatched the old
man waited patiently his head bowed ap-
parently oblivious to the curiosity and inso-
lence of the pleidan soldiery by lifting
his head he might have gazed upon nina
and alius marce trussed at the center of the
plaza but they he was aware had not
watched his shameful progress across the
plaza had not recognized him so sunk were
they in misery already with a shrug of
his shoulders he forbore to call their at-
tention now to him or to say a word of
farewell

it was with similar feelings that he looked
at the proud arched door before him re-
membering how many times he had trod that
hallway in happier times amid the shouts of
subjects instead of the jeers of captors that
dolmician was now using his own house
filled old alius with disgust and loathing
but he steeled himself to bear it as he was
bearing the indignities now being offered
him

one of the pleidans called can this be
the proud ruler of neina

another shouted the old lion of an-
cienda is now a supplicant at the feet of
dolmician it would serve him right if
we tortured him publicly and sent him in to
the emperor in pieces

the chair of torture

at this suggestion the first concrete of-
fer of violence there was an angry
surging in the crowd hands plucked at the
frayed robe of the deposed ruler his two
guards beat them down

alius murmured one of the guards
there is no reason why we should not turn
you over to your enemies here on the spot
but you have come bearing your insignia of
surrender and we shall obtain for you an

interview with the emperor if it is possible
look sharply-there is a break in the crowd
in front of you dash through it and into
the palace the soldiery will not dare to
follow you there you will be safe until
the messenger returns with instructions

the old man saw that an opening had in-
deed been made toward the front but he
looked steadfastly into the eyes of his guards
and refused to follow their suggestion

i have come this time to ancienda as a
supplicant it is true he said but the ruler
of neina does not run from a rabble your
arms are sufficient to protect me i shall
remain here until the messenger comes

he said it so proudly that for a moment
even the noisier members of the crowd were
silent observing the regal bearing of this
despised and dishonored old man his
words did more to quiet them than the ef-
forts of his guards

before the men on the outer fringe of the
rabble could renew their demands for his
blood ample evidence came to them that
the emperor had heard of old alius pres-
ence

it came in the form of a squad of soldiers
part of the inner palace guards preceded by
three trumpeters blowing loud blasts upon
their horns with them returned the mes-
senger who eagerly pointed out the former
ruler of neina as if there might be some
doubt as to which one of the crowd he was

the captain of the palace guards im-
mediately took charge

are you armed he demanded

old alius made no answer except to raise
his hands the guards and the people saw
through his torn and soiled raiment there
were obviously no weapons upon him his
left hand clutched the pathetic bauble that
had been an indication of his rank and was
now a token of surrender his right was
empty-a withered old hand that had once
gestured with authority but which was now
not sufficient even to hold a staff to aid
his faltering steps

the guard nodded curtly his heavy frog-
like head moving awkwardly on his neck
the two members of the planetary police
stepped back the squad of palace guards
formed a small hollow square with old al-
the return from jupiter



lus in the middle with the trumpeters
again ahead of them they marched into the
edifice that yawned before them toward the
inner room where dlmician sat surround-
ed by his women and his nobles ready to
receive this deposed and despised former
ruler of a satellite

slaves were pouring more wine into the
platinum goblets old alius held one in his
right hand smelled the stuff and calmly
poured it out upon the burnished floor with
a wry smile

i appreciate your hospitality he said
in mock apology but i am no barbarian
i cannot drink this stuff

dolmician was livid with rage a captive
had dared to insult him in the public hall
before his nobles

you come here as a supplicant asking
mercy of your rightful master he shouted
then you insult me when i offer you wine
-the royal wine of pleida which is good
enough-too good in fact-for any neinian
swine

he roused himself from his cushions sat
upright he continued his tirade shaking
a pudgy hand toward old alius who stood
silently among the guards

you were a coward-you ran away from
neina when you saw that we had conquered
her now you come here before me snivel-
ling dissembling begging mercy for your
withered old bones mercy-for you when
your people have been enslaved to pay for
your own and your sons stubbornness-

he paused to blow for breath his face
apoplectic old alius still stood be-
fore him without any visible display of
emotion dolmician saw that the old man
with his quiet fortitude was the more power-
ful figure that he was only making a spec-
tacle of himself before the others in the
room he smiled grew crafty his eyes
gleamed maliciously as he continued in a
subdued honeyed tone speaking this time
to the nobles and the women

but after all he is an old man is he
not he questioned mockingly why
then we shall forget our just resentment of
his conduct and he shall amuse us with his

antics guards bring for this gentleman
the special chair-the guest chair-

he waved indolently toward an alcove
there as the curtain was raised the assem-
blage saw the hideous chair of dolmician-
the chair renowned throughout the empire
from whose seat no one bidden to rest there
ever got up alive it was the chair of re-
fined and subtle cruelties that had been the
end of many a state prisoner the chair that
went everywhere with dolmician as much a
symbol of his power as his crown

there dolmician laughed with satis-
faction as they dragged it out wheeling it
upon rollers to a spot near old alius it
is my choicest honor-to sit there it is
the chair i reserve for my most select
friends-

he paused his lips parted expectantly
old alius glanced at the implement before
him and smiled in return

very well he said quietly since it is
your desire i shall sit in it the chair
looks innocent enough

there was a suppressed murmur in the
chamber as he stood before the engine that
would surely mean his death by torture
none dared to warn him yet several would
have since he seemed so innocent of dol-
micians real intent calmly he turned his
face toward the emperor reached back and
grasped the arms of the hideous trap and
lowered himself into it

there he said i am seated- his
eyes swept the room scanning the faces of
those present and coming back at length to
the laughing countenance of dolmician
but- he continued abruptly in an even
tone though with such steely assurance that
the whole room was swept into a shocked si-
lence by his words-i warn you dolmi-
cian not to give the signal that i see is even
now on your lips this chair so long as
you do not direct otherwise is only a chair
and i advise you to allow it to remain so
until you have heard me out

he held up his right hand to enforce a
continuance of the silence his words had
wrought the gesture was so imperious that
even the emperors face sobered and his ton-
gue was still the members of the palace
guard hovered over the prisoner but he di-


wonder stories

rgetrded them leaning forward casually to
continue his remarks as calmly as if they
were only part of the conversation of a mid-
summers day his manner deceived no
one least of all the emperor who detected
in this mans tone a dangerous timbre a
note as metallic and confident as the sound
of a saw	i

i came here said old alius because
i had a favor to ask of you dolmician in
doing so i dedicated myself to death for i
well knew that i should not escape from
your palace alive he shrugged his
shoulders ever so slightly as if to signify
that it was of great moment what became
of him

but in order to make sure that you
should not accomplish my demise before you
had granted the favor i am about to ask of
you i brought along something that should
be of interest to all present

slowly he extended both his hands
palms upward in the right there is
nothing but in the left they saw his amulet
glistening a black bobbin half the size of an
egg and as he showed it they perceived
that he held fast to it at one spot with his
thumb never for an instant relaxing his
pressure at that point

he smiled a little as they gazed at it
the amulet is hollow he explained and
contains about an ounce of a most powerful
explosive the old tellurian prepared it
for me supplying likewise a detonating
mechanism that works instantly all i need
do is lift the pressure of that thumb and we
should all be blown to atoms together with
this palace and its guards and a portion of
the city around us but stay-do not
move

if i see any man stirring before i give
him leave i shall be tempted to lift my
thumb as for you emperor i charge you
do not order the current to be turned into
this chair for i shall never die by torture
and you will not live to triumph over me

when he had finished there was a hush
so intense in the hall that the cries of the
rabble outside the palace gathering before
the two sufferers on the dais were clearly
audible

dolmician was trembling like a man with
ague he could scarcely gain command of
himself

speak he commanded hoarsely what
have you come here to ask of me

the voice of the old man was terrible in
its quiet intensity as he replied

let my people go

dont be a fool i shall not do that
very well then it shall be done for
you

old alius raised his steady left hand
already my thumb is tired i have held
this weapon for a long while but before
i go and before you go with me dolmician
let me tell you that i had arranged also for
this contingency plans are already afoot
upon the satellite for revolt backed up by
support from the planet your soldiers would
probably win and the revolution could not
succeed but with you blown to bits your
palace and the capital city in ruins your
empire shaken and disorganized we can
sweep them out of our cities and hunt them
down like rats and that is what will hap-
pen if you do not give the word

dolmician stared at his prisoner with
crafty eyes

and if i do yield he said what
then

i shall hold to my amulet until i have
assured myself that your promise has been
made good then since i cannot release it
without death to myself i shall go to some
waste desert place outside the city-and
raise my thumb

well then- the emperor paused a
fraction of a second while he turned over
in his mind his entire bag of tricks seeking
the best one to employ in this predicament
in that case i shall have to accede-

but old alius had perceived his hesita-
tion had seen the shifty eyes of the frog-
visaged man before him and was not fooled

hold on-do not move he warned if
you are sincere send for a messenger who
shall write down an order to your com-
mander salvarius carde as i dictate it
that order you shall sign with your imper-
ial seal and we shall sit here locked in this
chamber together until we have had word
that the order is being obeyed
the return from jupiter



the emperor stirred angrily seeing that
his opportunity for a trick had been snatch-
ed away

this has gone too far he exclaimed

then you will not accept my terms i
am sorry

the ruler of pleida and her satellites was
half rising from his position on the silken
cushions his face was livid turn on the
current in the chair he commanded this
old fool has no explosive in his hand he
is only making sport of us

instantly the guards sprang to do dolmi-
cians bidding in the same instant as if
he had been waiting for it old alius leaped
out of the deadly chairs embrace and raised
his left hand high above his head

from the throats of the nobles and the
soft-bodied ladies of the court there burst a
scream of terror they saw the ancient rul-
er of neina changed suddenly from a beard-
ed and quiet patriarch into a wind-blown
prophet of doom

 you think i am lying he cried you
shall learn better now and cast the amulet
down upon the hard floor at dolmicians
feet

fascinated by terror the others saw it spin
for a moment there the emperors eyes
were glued upon it his flabby body was
fixed in the crouching position he had as-
sumed when he gave his order

the earth semed to open at his feet where
there had been solid stone there was noth-
ing neither up nor down nor at the side a
thunderous roar traveled over the city like
a cloud of heavy smoke accompanied by
the ominous cracking of walls and the rum-
ble of caving masonry

chapter xvi
the great migration

it was a roar that seemed to echo round
the whole satellite of neina it was a
signal that thousands forewarned had been
waiting for

out of their holes rushed the neinians
armed determined attacking the city of an-
cienda the palace of the house of alius
came down in a tremendous cloud of dust

and flying debris which flew out over the
plaza obscuring the pathetic figures of nina
and alius marce hanging upon their plat-
form of shame but they did not long re-
main in the choking fog that closed down
over them eager gentle hands untied the
hateful thongs cried out words of love and
encouragement to them both

at the foot of the platform the old man
from tellus was standing waiting for his
daughter oblivious to the frightful battle
going on about him the din came faintly
through the strangling dust now faint now
clashing loudly mingled with the cries of
the enraged neinians and the gutteral
throaty shouts of terror-stricken and dis-
organized pleidans

faltering almost unable to walk nina
descended first the old man seized her to
him kissing her

nina nina- he seemed for the mo-
ment to be so overcome with joy that he was
unable to go on nina-we have pre-
pared a place for you go with these
guides-

alius marce he greeted as tenderly the
greatest patriot the house of alius has ever
produced has given his life and saved his
people he said now you are head of the
house of alius

alius marce looked at him quizzically
you have word of my father

the dust had begun to settle around them
now they could see the horrible carnage of
the plaza where the frenzied neinians were
massacring the troops of the late dolmi-
cian it seemed they were everywhere
neina had risen en masse for this revolt
in the mines at the signal they had turned
savagely upon their guards and whippers
had conquered them had come pouring up
out of the ground to fall upon the bewilder-
ed and leader less pleidans

the soldiers from the planet unable to
direct themselves were screaming for their
officers particularly for salvarius carde
the tyrant but he would never again com-
mand them he was buried under many
tons of masonry and his staff with him

your father has killed dolmician
blown up half of ancienda and made this re-
bellion possible murmured the tellurian


wonder stories

my father alius marces voice rang
with a strange mixture of sorrow and joy
he was no coward after all

old alius was the bravest man of the
neinians- the tellurian turned away
impulsively as he spoke brushing tears of
emotion from his eyes we have lost a
great man to gain neinas freedom

but the significance of his words was
partly lost on alius marce who had
in the course of a few seconds become a
new man gone was the shame of his cruci-
fixion in the plaza gone the despair and
dejection that had stared from his proud
eyes gone also was the false pride that had
marred him before the great battle with the
pleidans he seemed to rise in stature
firm sure-a true commander

the new head of the house of alius will
try to be worthy of the old he exclaimed
that is a formula that members of our
house have exclaimed time out of memory
upon their coronation but never before
was it said with more meaning

the tellurian clasped his hand i be-
lieve you are fit to be king of the new
world he murmured and nina-

she shall be queen cried alius marce

	 

who shall say what were the feelings of
the neinians when they embarked upon that
last journey away from their native earth
abandoning it to the elements

there were many who refused to go pre-
ferring death upon their cold satellites fam-
iliar lands than life on a world strange to
them

there were others who entered the great
space-cars trembling with terror at the dan-
gerous passage ahead of them the uncer-
tainties of the new life neinians who had
once been proud came humbly before the
old tellurian and alius marce and took
their places in the terrifying space-cars like
peasants abject unresisting

but there were also many particularly
the young who came joyfully scorning the
weakness and sentimentality of their elders
eager for new sights and new experiences
they came with their necessary household
appliances strapped to their backs with pet

animals seeds birds-all manner of things
for the new world like the peoples of old
who crossed the trackless tellurian prairies
of north america surrounded by trinkets
and mementos of the lands they were for-
saking

the old tellurian and alius marce had
seized many of the great transport ships of
the pleidans and had made them over into
suitable craft for the journey to tellus in
all more than nine hundred were filled with
inhabitants of neina additional craft were
loaded with foodstuffs seeds building ma-
terials tools apparatus-all of the things
the neinians might need before they had
learned to extract such substances from the
wrinkled skin of tellus

there were also animals-the domestic
buljars of neina which yield both milk and
labor the bright-hued birds of the neinian
forests insects such as were deemed neces-
sary for the fertilization of growing things
some space-ships were like arks providing
room for at least a pair of every common
living thing to transplant upon tellus the
useful the ornamental and even creatures
that had been considered nuisances who
shall saw what is a nuisance and what nec-
essary it might well be that what on
neina was a detriment would become on
tellus the virtue of virtues

as fast as the ships were loaded the old
man gave the sign that sent them on their
way each managed by a skillful and exper-
ienced navigator on pleida he knew an
expedition was already being formed by
dolmicians successor to reconquer the satel-
lite there was no time to be lost in de-
barkation

the ship containing the tellurian alius
marce and nina was the last to go in the
plaza the bareheaded throng of those who
had pleaded to be allowed to remain with
their dying world until the end watching
silently while the last of the space-ships was
loaded and prepared

people of neina cried alius marce at
length are there any more who wish to go
there is a little room

but the throng remained silent the old
man gave the signal alius marce entered
the heavy doors clanged shut
the return from jupiter



back came the huge lever in the control
room that startea the huge rockets in ihe
tail nina and alius marce stood in their
cabin near the nose staring out of the round
windows through which they were to view
the disappearance of a world the procession
of the firmament the growing of the sun
they were clasped in each others arms

i love you i love you whispered alius
marce as the huge rocket ran along the
launching-way fire shooting from its hun-
dreds of combustion tubes nina did not
reply but rested her head against his breast
they felt the great craft tear into the at-
mosphere they experienced the tremendous
sensations of acceleration the crushing
speed of the ascent their ears throbbed
their hearts pounded

in a moment they could look out again
behind them slowly turned the forsaken

satellite alius marce looked back at it
his eyes were filled with tears

but nina motioned for him to stand be-
side her at a window near the space-crafts
nose even without the telescope they could
now see the cloud of vessels that had preced-
ed them speeding off through inky space
toward tellus

neinians shall people the universe she
declared earnestly today i am a pro-
phetess and i foretell it

from tellus they will draw strength to
spread out among the solar earths from
whence in eons to come they shall speed
as bright envoys of the sun and its peoples
to planetary systems of which we have no
knowledge it is their destiny-and ours
alius marce held her at arms length
looking at her my people have much in-
deed to learn he exclaimed from tellus

continued from page 

for me the hour was full of infinite sor-
row and a strange excitement in the reali-
zation that man was abandoning his im-
memorial home and would henceforward be
an exile among the worlds but the face of
kronous was a marble mask and i could
not surmise his thoughts and feelings

at last he turned to me and smiled with
an odd wistfulness it is time for me to
go-and time for you also he said good-
by hugh-we shall not meet again re-
member me sometimes and remember the

final fate of the human race when you are
back in your own epoch

he pressed my hand briefly and then
climbed aboard the space-liner and he and
altus waved to me through the thick crystal
of a sealed port as the huge vessel rose in
air for its flight upon the interplanetary
void sadly regretting almost that i had
not insisted upon accompanying them i
locked myself in the time-vessel and pulled
the lever which would begin my own flight

for the may issue

we offer
utopia island

we are more than pleased to present to our readers beginning with the next issue
the complete novel utopia island by otto von hanstein our readers who have read
the quarterly will no doubt remember his jwo other masterpieces-between earth
and moon and electropolis-which caused it- tremendous stir not only in europe
where the stories were published first but in the united states as weu when the stories
appeared in the quarterly

this new story by otto von hanstein is as daring as his others and in many re-
spects far surpasses them

the story contains literally dozens of new scientific prophecies which we have never
seen in print before and which are sure to be realized in the future von hanstein has
even gone into the field of -sports and has evolved a number of sports unknown at the
present time all based upon new scientific discoveries

you will marvel at the versatility and the prophetic insight of the author in this
never-to-be-forgotten story

ed earl repp

adds to his successes by this new interplanetary tale

in which the life forms on a strange world are vividly portrayed in a story filled with
action and terrifying suspense we cannot expect human beings on venus or mars
but we can expect life and intelligent life what will it be like and how will it react

motion in space

editor science questions and answers

if an object were dropped from outer space and
did not strike a planet star or some other heavenly
body would it ever reach a destination or is space
limitless

daniel schwartz

 saratoga street

newport ky

we beltave our correspondent is under a misap-

frehension with regard to the nature of outer space
d outer space there is no up or down such us
we know it we think of up as the direction away
from the earth and down as the direction toward
the earth now if one were far away from any
heavenly body there would be no sense whatever of
up or down

furthermore there could be no such thing as drop-
ping a body that term again is purely terrestrial
we drop a body when we hold it above the earth and
then release it se that the earths attraction can pull
it toward her

now if we were in empty space far from any
heavenly body and were to release our object then
for all practical purposes it would remain right
where it was placed in reality it would move ex-
tremely slowly attracted by some other body such
as a star or planet and it would move toward that
star or planet and hit it therefore by the definition
of torms such a thing as our correspondent pictures
could not occur to understand such phenomena as
ecur fat outer space one must leave behind all of
his purely terrestrial notions and get back to funda-
mental realities

if there were only two heavenly bodies in the unl-

the earth and one other no matter how far
away they were they would eventually be drawn to
each other by the power of universal gravitation and
finally either hit each other or form some sort of 
dual heavenly system rotating about each other
there can be no state of rest in a universe filled
with matter-editor

new york to san francisco

editor science questions and answers

i have an argument on my hands which i would
like you and the readers of wonder stories to
back me up on if i am correct otherwise pull me
all to pieces i i

let us consider san francisco as being  miles
west of new york for convenient reckoning now lei
us assume that a plane leaves new york at  nooa
on jan st headed for san francisco at a speed oc
 miles per hour as registered on its dials it is
claimed that the plane travels west in space an
that flying from san francisco to new york under
the same conditions travels east in space 
miles

i	contend that the following applies-the earth
revolving on its axis presents roughly  miles of
its surface to the sun in  hours and that the plane
in flying from new york to san francisco west
actually merely suspends itself above the earth and

the earth presents a point  miles west on its sur-
face for the plane to land on and that the plane in-
d of flying west is actually moved east in space
the extent of roughly  miles  of
 of the earths orbit around the sun which ii

the device utilizes the telegraphone principle hie
speech is passed through an amplifier and through
a microphone and through electromagnets by which
process it is transformed into a series of magnetic
fluctuations a steel wire passed between the mag-
nets is polarised with these fluctuations

to tranmit the speech from the wire the wire is
unreeled between electromagnets and induces in the
magnetic circuit a fluctuating car rent which is passed
through amplifiers- and through a microphone into
speech to transmit the speech to the sleeper head-
phones may be used as shown in the illustration the
telegraphone is an established instrument used ex-
tensively by the telephone companies for retarding
telephone conversations its utilization is new

thus a man sots the dials on us machine to begin
playing a reel for say a lecture in history at mid-
night bach lecture is to last one hour and at the
end of an hoar the reel is automatically changed
thus during a night from midnight to six a m six
hours of instruction may be received

this device called by mr gernsback the hypno-
bioscope was tried out successfully by j a phin-
ney chief radioman u s navy and utilized at the
pensacola florida naval training school here one
may see naval students stretched out on long benches
asleep with casket-like coverings over their heads
the caskets contain two telephone receivers through
which radio code is sent to the sleeper it has been
demonstrated that the sleeping student can be taught
code faster than by any other means for the sub-
conscious mind never sleeps students who have
faihmf in their studies have passed examinations after
being taught by this method-editor

	wonder stories

in traveling from san francisco to now york i
maintain that the opposite of the above is not appli-
cable the plane flies supposedly at  miles pel
hour base the earth rotates at the same speed there-
foe it would seem that the plane would land on the
point it started from however the plane would have
to travel twice the speed and which i claim it does
to arrive in new york in  hours although its tacho
mater etc would read  miles per hour

in the planes trip to new york east its record
would be the same except that it actually moved west

many years ago mr gernsback planned a device
lor enabling one to learn while he sleeps in order
to overcome the terrific loss of time incurred by
sleeping he figured that for i of our ikes we

the operation of the hypnobio-
scope invented by hago gernsback

each reel on the machine con-
tains an educational lecture or a
subject of entertainment the wire
on the reel being used passes be-
tween electromagnets seen in the
lover part of the set where the
magnetic fluctuations of the wire
are induced into the magnetic cir-
cuit the current produced is am-
plified and changed into sound vi-
brations which pass to the sleeper
through headphones

in the above discussion one vital point must be
kept in mind an airplane travels through the air
it moves by the traction of its propeller through the
mr juat as a boat moves by the traction of its screws
through the water now the air above the earth is
just as much a part of the earth as the water is the
earth rotates about its axis once in twenty-four hours
carrying both air and- water with it and for the pur-
pose of tu discussion the air above the earth may be
considered as rigidly fixed to the earth

now when the airplane is on the ground it is being
carried through space with the earth by the earths
rotation for as we have said the air is rigidly fixed
to the earth therefore for the purposes of this dis-
cussion the motion of the earth on its axis may be dis-
regarded so in order for the plane to go from one
point on the earths surface to another it must cut its
way through the air just as a beat must

however if a vehicle of some kind were to rise
above the earths atmosphere then it might be freed
off the rotation of the earth if it rose above new
york and remained suspended in space the earth
would move under it and in a few hours it could
dfescend theoretically to san francisco if it were
at san francisco and wished to move to new york
it must acquire a speed greater than the earths
rotational speed at that point in other words in
order to remain above the same point above san
francisco it must move eastward in space at the rate
of some  miles per hour to catch up to new
york it must move faster than  miles per hour

editor wonder stories

i believe your readers would be interested to know
of the showing o the german u f a moon him
the girl in the moon under the auspices of the
american interplanetary society at the museum ofi
natural history in new york on january 

by the courtesy of hugo gernsback editor of
wonder stories we invited to the showing five
hundred subscribers of wonder stories who
lived in the metropolitan neighborhood the showing
of the film and a lecture by robert esnault-pelterie
he was unfortunately ill and his lecture was read
from the rostrum featured the evening and an at-
tendance of about  persons indicated the grow-

and shows with thrilling accuracy what a moon flight
will be like the making of the film was supervised
by hermann oberth the noted german rocket experi-
menter and not only scientific accuracy but film
artistry went into the making of it now the film is
to have a run in the movie houses of the country
titled by rocket to the moon

editorials in the new york herald-tribuns and the
new york times following the showing indicating a
new and respectful attitude by newspapers toward
the interplanetary problem allow me to quote from
the tribune editorial of january  the american
interplanetary society is an attractive organization
with a romantic name merely flying through the air
is already getting to be a somewhat dull business and
who can fail to applaud this first mobilization of in-
terest in the far more breath-taking projects of astro-
nautics-the navigation of the solar system 

the american interplanetary society believes that
it is truly mobilizing public opinion and focussing
its interest on interplanetary travel and so helping
to bring closer the day of an interplanetary journey
will be undertaken

memberships both active and associate the former
at j and the latter at  a year are offered to men
and women boys and girls who want to help us to
make the nation interplanetarily conscious and stimu-
late scientific development in the art the active
membership is confined to those over  years of age
with adequate scientific training who wish to take an
active part in our program the associate member-
ship admits all others who wish to receive our month-
ly bulletin giving the latest news of the world in
rockct and interplanetary development and have the
pride of assisting us to carry our work to a success-
ful completion amongour members are dr robert

the work that the american interplanetary so-
ciety is doing is truly making the nation aware that
a moon flight had departed from the category of
dreams and is on the way to becoming an actuality
the tenseness of the audience at the museum of n
tural history admission was free by the way
indicated how the picture gripped those thousands
who were there the society and its requests for
members has our heartiest support-editor

prophetic dreams are a form of travel

editor wder stories

about that time travel theme commented on in the
february issue mr jim h nicholson presents four
objections which are irrefutable from the angle he
looks at it but the point is it is like the farmer who
upon his first sight of a giraffe insisted that there
wasnt no such animal time travel is just plain
silly but unfortunately it is with us whether we
deny it or not

what do i mean simply that prophetic dreams
are a form of time travel out of every hundred of
cultured sensitive people you will almost infallibly
find four or five who have dreamed of things which
afterwards took place and out of these two or
three can prove it i am prepared to present the
evidence-only not for publication even though only
one in all the world had a single such dream it would
establish the potential reality of time travel and dis-
prove all the nightmares of materialism but when
the recorded cases run into hundreds as you can
ascertain from psychic research records-and other
cases unpublished are about us every day-certainly
we have a phenomenon ot nature which cannot be
waved aside

now coming down to cases mr nicholson presents
the instance of a man traveling into the future seeing
himself killed in an unpleasant way returning to his



correct time and committing suicide thus altering
the future well has it ever occurred to him that
events are all stationary and that the human con-
sciousness is capable of altering its time direction
through the field of events now i had almost said
a great deal more but just stopped in time upon the
reflection that i had been cogitating a story along
the line of time travel as it exists in nature the
fact is that time travel and time travelers exist at
this hour even though preventing themselves from
being born by going back and killing a grandfather-
another of mr nicholsons illustrations-is a little
outside of their regular line of activities that is
only a part that might be said the rest can wait
until i can get around to doing some more writing-
il someone doesnt beat me to it

i	cannot wholly agree with the editors remark
that past-time traveling stories are not permissible
because of the past being fixed there is a ten-
dency among scientific men at the present time to
accept reversible time expressed in the phrase the
present is pulled into existence by the future as
much as it is pushed into existence hy the past if
that is the case then the past is also alterable-but
lets not go into-that now

victor a endersby

 canon drive

montrose calif

mr endersbys statement that hundreds of cases
of prophetic dreams are known might come to some
of our readers with a shock of disbelief yet no
less a person than camille flammarion the late noted
french astronomer spent a number of years of his
life in gathering case data on such event he pre-
sents case after case in which people have seen in
dream or vision not only events to come but places
they were us visit but had not yet seen

fraud illusions who knows we can only
take the evidence and the rliability of m flammar-
ion for what it is worth perhaps at those moments
the subjects did get a mental vision of the time
curve that it was bent at that instant so that the
future met the present for a moment

the whole subject is one of the most intriguing
presented by all science-editor

editor wonder stories

i feel that i must write and congratulate mr
beattie on his -wonderful story the murders on the
moonship it was great but the picture spoiled it as

	knew how it would end it would have been more
interesting had the picture not shown the real mur-
derer the outpost on the moon was good but it
requires a sequel to finish it off the world with-
out was good but rather far-fetched

i am glad to see that a sequel to a rescue from
jupiter is coming next month also more about
the interplanetary police i find their exploits very
interesting forevvens sake dont print another
-story like a subterranean adventure it was the
most morbid and disgusting story i have ever read
and nearly cost me my magazine as the mater hap-
pened to pick it up and read about the frightful tor-
tures that could easily have been left out the next
iy several wonder stories helped to light the
lire but as you havent printed any more like it i
have been allowed to keep it please dont

i am sorry that you dropped the science in your
title you are catering to the common class of people
who arent educated enough to be interested in science
but just read the stories to get a thrill that they can
get in any magazine please bring back the science
news department it was the best feature in the
magazine i am pleased that you got control of
yourself and reduced the size of the magazine it is
much handier	

try and get stories that are uncommon i hare
read so many time traveling and transformation stor-
ies that i am sick of them i tried to write one my-
self about a scientist who cowld change cellular
growth and make animals grow boils or mastoids
that sent out destructive rays one escaped and got
the better of him but the story was the bunk i can
i only write air stories

returning to the old controversy is time traveling
possible personally i dont think it is there are
too many complications as mr nicholson points out
anyway if it were possible you would not be able
to take any part in the doings you would be invisible
end only able to watch being helpless to do anything

is it true that einstein has a theory stating that

	plus  equals  instead of  could it be
explained in words capable of being understood by a
high school student also is it true that a frog has
been discovered in suspended animation or is it some
more of mr beatties fiction

dry den ont

we know that mr einstein has upset a great many
things but we doubt if he can be accused of upset-
ting the multiplication table that at least still
stands

cases of what might be called suspended anima-
tion are met with frequently in the fish family fish
have been frozen solid and then thawed out only
to cause them to revive and be just as lively as ever
suspended animation is not at all contrary to na-
ture and given the proper circumstances a being
might be able to remain in such a state for a con-
siderable period-editor

the plat of murdering millions

editor wonder stories

 the sleeping war by d h keller represents
one of the most unreasonable and pernicious pieces
of anti-soviet propaganda released to date by your
publication just why your magazine which claims
to devote its pages to science could stoop to such a
level of cheap literature in distorting scientific facts
is beyond comprehension

disregarding personal opinions of the temporary
benefits of the soviet program one must admit the
ideals and aims of such a system of government are
above that of the nefarious plot of murdering mil-
lions of innocent people as depicted in the story
mentioned above to conclusively prove the rus-
sians capable of such insane acts one would natur-
ally have to believe all the silly propaganda published
by all the opposing factions of the world and last but
not least prove precedent parallel acts to substan-
tiate the case-which by the way is out of the ques-
tion

the revolution that placed them in power was
brought about by preliminary education of the mass-
es and was therefore practioally bloodless from
that time until the present date they have demon-
strated their peace desiring attitude by proposing
that each and every nation completely destroy their
war machinery only to be met with refusal and by
invading military forces of othor nations after such
treatment no honest and justice-loving person can
find cause to object to their vast military prepara-
tions for defense

the russian soviet government stands ub the
worlds greatest social experiment in which truth
and justice are struggling to overcome the combined
militant forces of the exploitive capitalist nations of
the world that their efforts are succceding are too
self evident for the peace ot mind of the powers
that be

let us leave the slaughter of countless millions of
innocent people to some of the more proficient capi-
talist nations of the world and not endeavor to crim-
inally convict a new social order until there is at
least enough circumstantial evidence or motive upon
which to convict

the american people have been led to hate by the
powers in control various races of people such as
the british spanish german austrians hungar-
ians chinese japanese mexicans etc inctuaing
milder hatreds of the jews italians negroes etc
and now it is our duty f to hate the russians
when one understands the economic reasons back of
such silly rot one cannot help but be thoroughly dis-
gusted with this new hate are we to hate tho es-
kimos after we finish vesting our hate on the rus-
sians there seem to be but few races left on this
old earth to hate

we have been accused as probably every maga-
zine has of every imaginable crime perhaps our
protests of innocence may become boring after awhile
naturally we deny any imputation of enmity against
the soviets we feel as our correspondent does
that the russian soviet government stands as tho
worlds greatest social experiments and we wish
it luck for if their ideals succeed it means that tho
innermost dreams of man that he can live in har-
mony with his fellowman and share equitably and
happily the wealth of their joint labors is possible

we do not attempt to dictate what our writers
shall say if what they have to say is within rea-
son if it is interesting if it is in accordance with
the editorial policy writers are free-editor

his severest critic

editor wonder stories

it was with the hope of stirring up some lively
discussion that i submitted my letter on the hum-
orous aspects of time-traveling which appeared in
the february issue of itty bitty wonder stories
and the editor so kindly published

in the hope of continuing this discussion i am
now going to do the most unusual thing ever at-
tempted by any f your reader speakineer
namely contradict myself by criticizing my letter
if the editor will be so kind as to try and ooze this
letter into the reader speaks the reader will find
i am as willing to admit my faults as the editor-
if he had anyl

just watch my smoke as i pull my humorous
aspects on time-traveling apart and lay it out in
its pure absurdity i

i will criticize my four statements in the order
in which they come here goes just watch my
smoke i

	if a fellow had a time-machine why would
he want to send it back to himself hed never be
able to get it again and therefore would be stranded
in his wrong time and why would he want to give
it to himself if he already had it

zzzzip i goes no 

	  if a person went into the future and
then came into the past any thoughts or intentions
he had at the time that would form a paradox and
be forgotten you see what i mean his mind

know he had forgotten and if he went back to the
future he wonld not remember that he had forgotten
it and therefore would not see any use in taking any
risk in traveling through time with another object

we cannot of course be responsible for the effect
on our readers of mr nicholsons abstruse mental

gmnastics the editors found thembelves wander-
g dazedly in a terrible mental fog and therefore
warn our readers accordingly

naturally it is interesting to find a young man so
open minded that he can be his own critic it is a

editor wonder stories

this letter may be a little late in reaching you but
i would like you to publish it if possible because i
tink that other readers have questions about this bub-
ject too

i read the story in your magazine called the satel-
lite of doom and allow me to say right here that i
think that it was very poorly put together and was in
general rather bum but that is the only brick-
bat that i want to throw

in the story the author said that space was prac-
tically an absolute vacuum he also said that space
contained no heat whatever and therefore was at ab-
solute zero he may not have used jast exactly those
words but that wa the thing implied he said that
as soon as briggs got into the vacuum his chest blew
open and he was immediately frozen solid now lis-
ten here the fellows chest might have blown open
but if the temperature was absolute zero his froz-
en body would have been contracted by the absence
of heat until there was practically nothing left be-
cause you know that when a thing is cooled off it
contracts and if there was no heat at all the action
of the molecules is zero and therefore the substance
contracts until there is nothing left

now just imagine what would happen to a space
fihip which went up into the ether no matter how
well the ship was insulated the absolute cold would
contract the outer shell until it crushed the inner
shell now what do you think about this i am not
going very such in detail about this but you ought
to see what i mean

now taking this problem from another angle if a
body is hot and you want to cool it you must conduct
the heat from it by using some other material in
other words the material to be cooled must be sur-
rounded by or be in contact with some other material

thing if the so-called ether is an absolute vacuum
no heat would be conducted from tho space bhip be-
cause there would be no material thing to conduct tho
heat away from the space ship evidently tho author
of tho story above referred to mubt not have reckoned
with this condition in his story

now i understand that a space ship would have to
be built o withstand a heavy pressure from within but
what i would like to know is-whether the heat would
be conducted away from a space ship after it has left
the atmosphere or not if not the author of the
story the satellite of doom has made a big error
and if eo the space ship would be contracted into
nothing how about it-eh-

bill simpson

 north wash

elk city okla

our correspondent is slightly in error when he
assumes that a temperature of absolute zero means 
contraction of the body to zero dimensions gases
have been solidified at near the temperature of abso-
lute zero and they still retain the greater part of their
bulk

a body would contract appreciably if the electrons
in its atoms were to cease their motion and fall into
the proton then a body would have only about
 of its original volume but in a condition
of absolute zero a body would not by any means con-
tract so appreciably

with regard to the second point our correspon-
dent forgets that heat is transmitted in three ways
by radiation and convection besides by conduction
thus the sun transmits its heat across 
miles of vacuum by radiation so a space ship would
radiate its heat into emptiness but the heat would
remain in the radiated waves until they btruck some
material body to which it could be transferred ra-
diation is a phenomona entirely different from con-
duction which as mr simpson rightly says needs
a material body-editor

would be superion

editor wonder stories

mr endersbys masterful editorial on sex and
life is too wonderful for words and i read it ovetj
several times with the keenest interest and delight
if this world would have more buch men life would
be really worth while there would be lebs people
of course but they would be mentally and physically
superior to a certain class that is continually howling
religion and the laws of god

ten to one mr endersby will be condemned to the
infernal regions for his open honesty he may be
even called abnormal but mind you this gentleman
does not uphold complete sexual restraint dut mod-
eration and moderation in all things of course the
clergy will claim that the mating instinct is always
present in man and that god ordained it bo as
long as the church harbors this billy belief religion
will continue to crumble

the majority of the people of today are more in-
telligent more broad-minded than their forbears they
see further they realize that the health of the race
depends on sane living and moderation it is this set
of intelligentsia that will eventually create the longed-
for utopia i admit a certain class is fighting it
fighting with teeth nails and cut bullets rotten poli-
tics but wait-the intelligentsia is spreading be-
coming stronger through its living ideal of strength
through moderation and truth three cheers for
brother endersby i come folks with a willl

now concerning time travelers vision of the
future the whole thing sounds very much like a
slight case of dementia praecox to me or did he in-
dulge in too many chasers i now i have no objection
to one taking a jolly nip occasionally in fact i bee
no harm in it but one can go too far and land into
the fourth dimension personally i havent been
there yet and naturally i get rather out of sorts
with one who has foolishly taken the trip somehow
he never quite recovers from the hock you know
folks ive often wondered if our senators and gov-
ernment officials have taken the trip and believe me
im not the only one who has suspicions another
angle time traveler mentioned a deep sleep
hmm sounds hopheadishly queer ill bet hes raving
by this time but one has to be careful what one writes
to a magazine that caters to the intelligentsia well

the terrors of aryl best gorgeously thrilling and

verses occasionally you could use them as fillers
and at the bftme time afford we poem bugs an extra

there is no doubt as to where mrs elliott stands
on the question raised by mr endersby the question
is one of such universal interest and so widely dis-

new social outlooks

editor wonder stories

in your list of noted associated editors you have
neglected to include one or more badly needed political
economists the reason for suchneglect may be due
to the impression political eoonomy is as a science
unrelated to the other fields of scientific endeavor
or in case an author should make an error in a story
the average reader would not notice it such an error
on your part is not justified by facts

the average reader i believe likes to feel enough
confidence in the editorial staff of wonder stor-
ies to have the satisfaction of reading stories that
are basically scientific even though of a phantastio
nature

it nevertheless seems to be more or less the popular
conception that it is the proper thing to endeavor to
belittle or deride any economic move of the working
class to wrest control from the exploitating class with
the everlasting contention it would be impractical vis
ionary and unsatisfactory page  of the w s
feb issue in the outpost of the moon illustrates this
point to a certain degree in fact future races aro
even depicted bb living under a social system like
ours as though it were the last word in human ach-
ievement

they seem to want to disregard the scientific fact
that a worker or laborer is a producer of the social
wealth whether he poshes a pen or a wheel-barrow
and that a capitalist is one who appropriates this so-
cial wealth for personal selfish manipulations tho
capitalist class utilizes both skilled and unskilled work-
ers to exploit the natural resources and in return for
such services give those who are lucky enough to have
such employment on the average one-sixth of tho
amount of social wealth produced the balance is
economically known as surplus value-or capital-or
unpaid labor

the capitalist class employs scientific workers to
manage or supervise the industries and protect this
exploitive control by employing other workers to
promulgate unscientific economic theories so that tho
worker is incapable of doing the very thing they are
virtually doing-operating and managing the means
of production and distribution

the writer like others are of the opinion wonder
stories could better serve mankind by publishing
stories with a more liberal and scientific outlook on
economic questions rather than to publish sterotyped
propaganda it would at least appear more in line
with scientific endeavor for the entire world is more
seriously contemplating making a social change you
certainly would not lose subscribers but would gain
attention and respect from the class which constitutes
your readers

p m vancuren

 strong ave

elkhart ind

we believe that mr vancuren has missed tho
poinfof mr maxwells picture of the ganymedian civi
lization what mr maxwell stated and what all dis-
interested people will admit is that people in a mass
do not always have the final wisdom in managing tho
affair of a complicated civilization-that the voice
of the people is the voice of god is not always true

the ganymedian populace mr maxwell howed aa
being impatient with the efforts of scientists to make
discoveries in pure science-they wanted them to turn
their efforts directly into things of immediate use

now we must admit that the man on the street
may not always have the knowledge necessary to judge
the value of the work of a scientist very often too
scientists are prone to become academic on their work
and to spend the money of a nation for their own
private speculations when the money is urgently needed
to alleviate human misery

but the conflict mr maxwell paints is not at all ono
between capital and labor	

we deny any attempt at all to foster propaganda or
to suppress any social or political views whatsoever
the charge has been made before and we deny it as
emphatically now as we did then we do not dictato
what point of view our authors shall take and we
would just as cheerfully print one type of story as
another so long as they are interesting

if our memory serves us correctly practically all
wonder stories



the btoiies of tho future picture worlds in which busi-
ness for profit has vanished and all people re en-
sured comfort and happiness these stories all pre-
sume that a competitive civilization such as ours is a
childish or antiquated device and that when man
really grew up he got rid of it we cannot see mr
vancurens contention that future states are pictured
as unfair to the workers-editor

the manufacture of imitation men

editor wonder stories

i must first thank you for between worlds
which i found most interesting the manner in
which the author explains the angels of mons was
most original and effective

i think the new size of wonder stories is a
great improvement and in spite of what mr pancoast
says in tho january issue i think most readers will
agree that it is more convenient than the original
size

the covers are usually much too lurid as mr phillip
waite says and in public attract attention though
this may be a good thine from your point of viewl
with its bright yellow-or otherwise-color

now as to the stories

tlio time annihilator-very good

the invulnerable scourge-good

lords of the deep-fair-although this is not
iquito the type for wonder stories

the outpost on the moon-promises to be good

the end of time-good

the struggle for venus -fair-sequel wanted

tho satellite of doom-fair

the flaming cloud-good

death from the seas-quite good but not very
original

the gland men of the island -good

this was also unoriginal there are many stor-
ies dealing with a crack-brained oriental it is usu-
ally a chinaman plotting to overrun the world with
supermen stupid dut possessed of  great physical
strength

i dont care for the stories that deal with the
manufacture of imitation men either in the form
of robots or actually of flesh and blood such as
the soulless entity and the synthetic men

the house in the clouds hornets of space
and the air plant men i catalog as only fairly
good

give us more stories of the fourth dimension or
why not occasionally one of the fifth-traveling in
time either backwards or forwards-and of course
interplanetary and inter-universal travel

as regards the reader speaks by all means keep
this up i always read these letters and am very
interested in other peoples views mr editor you
must get black and blue from the brick bats that
get slung at you by some people i how can you
please everybody though i think you do all you
can to do so i should not think editine a monthly
magazine is exactly a bed of roses unless you in-
clude the thornbl

i wish wonder stories was published over
here then we would probably see it on every book-
stall as it is i have to place a special order with
librarie hachette and i always have to wait acs
between numbers science and air wonder stories
used to be sold at the stalls but were for some reason
withdrawn

i am with mr haggard in wanting the authors
pictures removed they only take up space and dont
really interest the reader who cares for the auth-
ors face the story is the point that counts-not
his physical beauty-or otherwise i

as to more illustrations although they would
certainly give one a much better idea of what the
author writes about it would take a lot out of the
printing space and could only be counteracted by en-
larging the magazine

now-as to the old question-a love interest yes
but for heavens sako keep it down dont let a
good story of a scientific nature deteriorate into mere
slush that can be bought by the ream at any stall

i	think that the removal of science news of the
month an improvement although interesting one
does not expect it in a science-fiction magazine but i

from england we get this excellent resumfi of
the stories illustrations and in fact everything wo
wish to call mr murtons attention to the new science
fiction circle in england mentioned in the march
issue the club promises well and science fiction in
the home of h g wells is beginning to take its
rightful place among other literature-editor

let heroes be machines

editor wonder stories i

in mr gernsbacks editorial in the january issue
i find the following

it is my opinion that if you eject a human being
without protection from a space flyer he will not
have time to explode because he will probably be
frozen olid instantaneously

very well

now in the outpost on the moon in the same
issue i find this thought expressed as soon as
the machine left the atmosphere all the air between
the outer and inner walls escaped leaving a perfect
vacuum which prevented loss of heat by convection

now my knowledge of vacuums is about confined to
the one in my head but in my opinion joslyn max-
well is right and mr gernsback for once is wrong

mr gernsback assumes that the unfortunate man
radiated all his heat into space which he describes as
a vacuum one wonders about the efficiency of a
thermos bottle and similar tireless cookers

mr maxwell assumes that the vacuum will not ab-
sorb heat hence his ship is warm i have noticed
in other interplanetary tales where the author has
used double hull construction-with a vacuum be-
tween-to avoid radiation of heat into space-an-
other vacuum why 

then there is the idea familiar to readers of the
man in space being cooked on the sunward side and
frozen on the other from the foregoing it would ap-
pear to me that the poor fellow would be well cooked
-all through

any arguments

as to the mag sometimes i think that the field of
science fiction has been worked out like a rich pocket
of gold like the western thrillers they all seem to
be copies of one original good story then some one
comes along with fireworks in the form of a new idea
and i get all enthused again so im not kicking
at all

still i have noticed a tendency toward cheap sen-
sationalism in the last year in science fiction not
only our mag but others have developed a taste for
shrieking damsels always helplessly in the power of a
sneering villain-and super-heroic tireless heroes who
can make all sorts of blunders and live and never do
much of anything until fifty minutes past the eleventh
hour when they suddenly become masters of all sorts
of science language etc too melodramatic by far

will you please tell paul to stick to the machines
his machine drawings would be a ource of inspiration
to jour best authors-and may have been often
enough but when it comes to humans-well i may
as well confess that its the last cover that got my
goat i gathered from the story that the woman was
frowsy well paul was it paul tried to overcome
that

that stiff bold outline drawing that blood-col-
ored dress against a yellow back the man-being
a machine man-looks almost human the woman
looks like a frozen war figure in a melodramatic and
unnatural pose	  

in conclusion i read somewhere that the naval
observatory claims that mother earth has a tail is
this true		

when you find an author who can treat romance
as he can cold bcience embrace him hes rare
but for cats sake keep your purely science-minded
writers to pure science i let your heroes be machines
in science but let them be simply human in love i

wonder stories	

mr wilson lists a full bill of complaints we agree
that science fiction i not perfect-it is too young too
struggling too new it is now cutting its teeth so
to speak learning by experience and getting the wis-
dom of the world to grow up into the strong healthy
being it is sure to become

as to science fiction exhausting itself wo are in
complete disagreement with mr wilson science fic-
tion is just as inexhaustible as the possible future of
the race the number of possible futures both in
time and place are infinite the possibilities of sci-
ence and their effect on the race are infinite

it happens to all of ns that we reach a period of
dayb perhaps when everything palls on us we feel
sour disappointed tired and bored then every-
thing we see and touch is unimportant and worthless
in those dark periods we must have faith and be
patient

the necessity of the vacuum between the walls of
tho space ship is not to prevent radiation but to pre-
vent conduction of heat conduction is a phenomena
that operates much differently than radiation thus
the sun radiates heat to us across the vacuum of
space but it could not conduct heat-for conduction
needs a material body for its transference wo the
vacuum between the ships walls prevents conduction

the acquiring of a tail  by the earth is news to
uo we would like to hear more about it-editor

editor wonder stories

i have been getting your magazine since the first
issue but this is the first time i have taken the
trouble to give you my opinion about it

however before i do so i wish to thank mr
hugo gernsback through whom i received an in-
vitation from the american interplanetary society to
attend an address by robert esnault-pelterie on by
rocket to the moon

unfortunately mr pelterie was ill and could not
attend but the motion picture was shown and i
wish to state that it was great i would also like to
say that i consider it an honor to receive a personal
invitation to attend and would state that if any
other time something of this sort is featured i would
like to know about it so that i might attend

and now for my opinion about your magazine
yours too-editor

i think that it has every other scientific magazine on
the market beat so keep up the good work i would
like to have you publish more stories by dr david

h	keller charles r tanner and ray cummings

the first part of the return from jupiter writ-
ten by gawain edward was very good from out
cf the earth bv ed earl repp was excellent and i
wish mr repp would write a sequel to this story so
that i could learn what became of the monster

times the various phases of interplanetary travel are
discussed

the last meeting was on the evening of february

nothing as gripping

editor wondeb stories 

i have just finished reading the march issue of

eour magazine and hasten to write you to tell you
ow good it is two stories stand out head and
shouldora from the rest i refer to back to 
ad and the return from jupiter with the first
named story in the lead

it is a long time since i have read anything as
gripping as that last scene in back to  ad
when tho earth race from neptune go out one by ono
to fight jed what a conception that jed is too it
held me tense in my seat to the very labt word tho
whole tale showed us a picture of a far off future
that is exceptionally imaginative aud yet quite prob-
able i read schachner  zagats first story and
this is even better wonderful as that was more
power to these two authors give us more of their
stuff

and edwards too the return from jupter i
not quite as good as his resoue from jupitfer which
i remember as a very fine tory but toward tho end
it got into full swing the next installment should be
a humdinger

the other stories in the issue were pretty good with
the exception of-the synthetic monster which is old
etujt i havt read lots of stories just like it and
from out tho earth which is terrible this fel-
low repp never did strike me as being much of a
writer and this one proves it dont print any more
like it

now that i have gotten all my likes and dislikes
off my chest ill say that wondfr stories is the best
magazine in the field and i read all ol them

aurora borealis

editor science questions and answers

would you please answer for me the following
questions

	what is the aurora borealis

	what causes it

sam appelbaum

 so market st

canton ohio

 the anrora borealis or northern lights is a
brilliant display of colored light seen rising above tho
earth consisting of irregular patches and dancing col-
umns of light rapidly changing forms its beams
often of various hues are found to be virtually par-
allel to the free magnetic needle which points toward
the magnetic north pole

	the exact cause of them is not known the as-
sumption is that they are caused by electrical di-
charges between the earth which is really a magnet
and the suns magnetic influence hence daring ex-
tensive displays of the aurora there is a great dis-
turbance caused to telegraphy and radio indicating
an effect of electrical nature

the frequency of the aurora that is the period be-
tween the time of maximum display has been calcu-
lated s  years since sun spots also appear in 
year periods a close connection between the two is be-
lieved to exist

there is a similar display near the south pole called
aurora australis or southern lights while the term
aurora polaris or polar lights is used to indicate both
displays-editor

experiments in atomic science
for the amateur by james l clif-
ford  pages illustrated stiff cloth
covers size  vz x  published by
richard g badger boston price 

new developments in atomic science are not con-
fined exclusively to highly trained scientists our
knowledge about the atom and some of its energy
manifestations have advanced far enough to permit
of experiments in a simple laboratory to delight the
amateur some of these possible experiments our
author outlines in this volume

there are experiments with radioactive substanccs
the gold leaf electroscope osmosis ultra violet and
photo-electric effects and many others the point of
the author is that young experimenters can do much to
keep alive an interest m this comparatively new field
of scientific exploration and perhaps make discoveries
of value

such experiments mr clifford states are not ex-
pensive for example enough of a radium eompound
can be obtained for ten dollars to carry out the ex-
periments he outlines this radium however is merely
a small part of a crude ore unrefined

experiments with radium even the little tests that
give visual indication of the presence and activity ef
radium should prove fascinating to the experimenter
and open up a new world of intriguing interest

flights from chaos by harlow shap-
ley  pages illustrated stiff cloth
covers size  x  published by
whittesley house mcgraw-hill com-
pany new york price 

dr shapley who is director of the harvard ob-
servatory takes us out of our calm vision of the uni-
verse by doing two contradictory things first he
indicates the unlimited diversity of material systems
in the universe from the microcosmic the ultra-small
to the macroeosmic that part of the universe open
to mans senses he then proceeds to show that it is
not all as bad as it sounds that in this welter and
confusion of material systems order can be established
once creating chaos he shows how we can escape
from it

liis purpose is to organize the material world into
definite groups and thence to find the relationship
between these groups and perhaps the meaning of
them beginning with a classification of the ultra-
microscopic which he leaves unnamed for any possible
contingency his groups are corpuscles which in-
clude electrons protons and light quanta atoms
molecules molecular systems colloidal or crystalline
aggregates which includes biologic entities such as
man meteoritic associations satellite systems plane-
tary structures double and multiple stars galactic
cloisters globular clusters and on up to the universe
the space-time complex

and even here at the furthest reach of mans vision
he must leave the door open for a still higher entity
which dr shapley prefers not to define curiously
enough he places man midway between the small and
the great but these classifications he gives us with
a great deal of humility a few decades ago he
says not even the atoms would have been admitted
to the society of systems atoms were little hard
chunks of matter indivisible by grace of name and
experience and scientific dogma experience certain-
ly recommends caution in asserting any lower limit
in the organization of the microcosmos

in our common elements too he leaves the door
open with jeans he agrees that uranium need not
be the heaviest of metals jeans surmises that thebe
heavy elements may be highly radioactive like the
known atoms from radium to uranium and that the
ultimate source of stellar energy can be sought suc-
cessfully in the spontaneous decay of heavy unstable
elements in the stellar interiors

the book serves admirably the purpose of organizing
our chaotic notions about the infinitely diversified uni-
verse it parallels the attempt of jeane who in his
mysterioub universe seeks ever and ever an ex-
planation
