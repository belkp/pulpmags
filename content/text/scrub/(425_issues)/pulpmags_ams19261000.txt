 imagination and reality

                            by hugo gernsback

hen reading one of our scientifiction
stories in which the author gives free
rein to his imagination providing he is
a good story teller we not infrequently
find ourselves deeply thrilled the rea-
son is that our imagination is fired to
the nth degree and we thus obtain a reat-satisfaction
from the time spent in reading the story improbable
as it often appears at first i should like to point out
here how important this class of literature is to
progress and to the race in general

  the human mind is a tremendously complex ma-
chine which often works in a very strange manner
a man sets out to invent a certain house appliance
and while engaged in his experimental work gets a
certain stimulus that takes him in an entirely differ-
ent direction so that the first thought of the house
appliance may end in the invention of a factory
labor-saving device or perhaps something even more
important

  when alexander graham bell was a young man
he occupied himself by devising means of enabling
the deaf to hear this led him into electrical re-
search work and the apparatus far from becoming
a device by which the deaf can hear became the pres-
ent telephone to be sure loud-speaking telephones
are made today for the use of the deaf but this is
only a by-product and not at all the actual and more
important use of the instrument

  hundreds and thousands of similar instances
could be cited an author in one of his fantastic
scientifiction stories may start some one thinking
along the suggested lines which the author had in
mind whereas the inventor in the end will finish up
with something totally different and perhaps much
more important but the fact remains that the au-
thor provided the stimulus in the first place which
is a most important function to perform

  on the other hand many devices predicted by
scientifiction authors have literally come true for
many generations there is an old popular saying
that what man imagines man can accomplish this
proverb of course should be taken with a grain of
salt because not everything that man imagines is

possible for instance i can imagine that i blow
out the sun or grasp the moon in my hand or cut
off my head without dying naturally such things
are impossible on the other hand many of the so-
called wild ideas which we read in our scientifiction
stories may prove to be not quite so wild if they give
an actual stimulus to some inventor or inventor-to-
be who reads the story and as long as there is a
stimulus of any sort we have no reason to complain
because we never realize where progress in any di-
rection may lead us

  there is the well-known story of the inventor who
had patented a mouse-trap and finally sold the pat-
ent to a manufacturer who found that an excellent
burglar alarm could be made from the mouse-trap
with but a few changes another case of an original
stimulus which perhaps went wrong but finally
became righted

  we should not therefore become too impatient if
occasionally we encounter a seemingly impossible
prediction or improbable plot it is beyond our pow-
er to foresee what reaction this may produce in
some one and what tremendous consequences it may
have in the future and strange to relate the pa-
tent offices of most countries follow scientifiction
stories pretty closely because in many of these the
germ of an invention is hidden it is not necessary
to actually build a model to be an inventor often it
becomes necessary for court proceedings and for
patent reasons to find out who really was the orig-
inal inventor of a certain device if the inventor is
an author who brought out the device even in a fic-
tion story this would in the long run entitle him to
ownership of the patent always providing that the
device is carefully described as to its functions its
purpose and so forth

  for instance in the united states the inventor
would have two years from the publication of the
story to apply for a patent thus it will be seen that
a scientifiction story should not be taken too lightly
and should not be classed just as literature far
from it it actually helps in the progress of the
world if ever so little and the fact remains that it
contributes something to progress that probably no
other kind of literature does

beyond the pole



introductory note by dr abbott e lyman

before giving this really marvelous tale to
the world i feel that it is important to offer
a few lines of explanation as well as a brief
sketch or synopsis of the events that led to my dis-
covery of the manuscript relating the incredible ad-
ventures of this writer

  as a fiaturalist specializing in ornithology i had
long been attracted to the regions of the little
known antarctic as a rich field for my studies very
largely perhaps my interest in antarctic ornith-
ology was due to the fact that i resided in new bed-
ford a town famous in former years for the number
of its whaling vessels many of which sailed an-
nually for the southern oceans in search of sea-ele-
phant oil from the officers of theae vessels i
obtained many specimens of birds skins and eggs
brought back by the obliging whalemen such
specimens were however more or less unsatisfac-
tory for scientific study and i at last made up my
mind to visit the antarctic in person in order to
observe and study that avifauna in its own habitat

  it thus happened that i secured passage upon a
whaleship bound for the south atlantic and south
indian oceans and after an uneventful voyage of
several months i found myself gazing from the
barks deck at the frowning mountain peaks of
kerguelen or as it is also called desolation island

  here in company with some ten of the barks
crew i was landed and having been amply sup-
plied with provisions tools and implements of the
whalemens trade we saw the vessel sail away for
south georgia there to land other parties which
like our own would remain upon the barren bits of
land until the barks return the following year

  i need not enter into a description of the wonder-
ful fauna and flora of the island nor need i dilate
upon the rare and interesting specimens which re-j
warded my daily tramps over the bare basaltic hills
or through the thick scrub and rank grass of the
valleys although to me those days were filled with
fascination and all the naturalists enthusiasm at
treading new fields of study

  suffice it to state that on one misty morning hav-
ing penetrated far into the interior of the island
in search of a new rookery of albatross i was
attracted by the strange behavior of one of these
great birds

  he appeared unable to rise from the ground al-
though he repeatedly spread his immense wings and
flapped upward for a few inches but each time
he fell back and struggled awkwardly about upon
the earth

  my nearer approach disclosed the fact that the
birds legs was entangled in some object among the
rocks and walking to within a few yards of the
albatross i was surprised to find that a cord or line
was attached to the birds leg while the other
extremity of the cord was fastened to an object
that glittered curiously in the light

  consumed with curiosity for i knew that no
human beings had recently visited the spot i cau-
tiously approached the albatross and throwing my
coat over its head i stooped and endeavored to dis-
engage the line from the birds leg i found how-
ever that the cord which was of a most unusual
metallic lustre was spliced or woven about the leg

  i therefore drew my sailors sheath knife and
strove to cut the line which was scarcely larger
than twine imagine if you can my surprise when
the keen-edged blade slipped uselessly along the
cord as though the knife had been of wood and the
line of steel

  judging that the affair was some form of wire
rope i then placed it across a small rock and ham-
mered it with another stone but without avail
bending it rapidly back and forth was equally
futile and i therefore turned my attention to the
object to which the cord was attached and which
appeared to be a thin glass cylinder some two
inches in diameter and approximately six inches
in length through the crystal i could discern a
roll of some material resembling paper and feeling
sure that this was a message of some sort i struck
the bottle-like receptacle a smart blow with a bit
of rock i remember that even as i did so i was
mentally wondering how such a fragile receptacle
had escaped annihilation during the rough usage
to which it must have been subjected by its winged
carrier but even this vague thought did not prepare
me for the result of my blow indeed i cannot
adequately transcribe my utter amazement as the
stone rebounded from the glass container without
leaving so much as a scratch or a crack upon the
surface

  i was in fact absolutely dumfounded eagerly
i stooped and examinined the strange object more
closely and minutely i discovered a small catch
or button near one end of the cylinder and as i
pressed upon this the cord was suddenly released

  with the cylinder now in my possession i gave
no further heed to the albatross which immediately
flew off a most regrettable incident as he carried
with him the remarkable ligature which had i
secured it would have proved of inestimable scien-
tific value but my attention was focussed com-
pletely upon the container which i found was re-
markably light about the weight of aluminum i
judged but despite its apparently fragile char-
acter i could not succeed in either breaking or dent-
ing the remarkable material try as i might

  my curiosity was now at fever heat for i knew
of a certainty that no such material was known to
civilized man and that any message or communica-
tion enclosed within it must be of the utmost im-
portance and interest in order to examine it more
closely i opened my pocket lens and commenced most
carefully and painstakingly to go over the smooth
surface of the astonishing receptacle

  in so doing i advertently brought a point of light
to a focus upon the cylinder all that had gone be-
fore was as nothing to the astounding result of this
accidental procedure instantly the material com-
menced to melt and run like wax in a few brief
moments i had melted a space completely encircling
the cylinder and from the aperture thus made i
drew forth the roll of manuscript-for such the con-
tents proved to be and spreading the pages com-
menced to read the incredible story written thereon
certain passages names and references assured
me that the story was no fiction nor the work of a
disordered mind for many of the incidents men-
tioned as well as names referred to were familiar


amazing stories

to me i clearly remembered the departure of the
bark endeavor her failure to return and the
various newspaper accounts of her disappearance
with the published lists of her personnel these
facts as i have stated would alone have convinced
me even had i not felt assured from the character
of the receptacle chosen to hold the manuscript that
the tale was true for the material could not have
been obtained or prepared in any known country or
by any known race of men

  deeply have i regretted since that time the fact
that my engrossment with the manuscript swept
all thoughts of the cylinder from my mind i had
carelessly dropped it as i secured the contents and
when having read and reread the astounding tale
from beginning to end i looked for the receptacle
it could not be found my closest and most pains-
taking search failed to reveal it whether it had
rolled into some crevice or hole in the volcanic rock

or whether some curious albatross attracted by the
glitter of the cylinder had surreptitiously
approached and swallowed it i shall never know

  but even without the cylinder and its attendant
 cord as corroborative evidence as to the truth of
 the story i so strangely obtained the tale itself is
 so manifestly fact and is of such incalculable value
 to the world that i have not the slightest hesitation
 in publishing it

   the manuscript quite unaltered is reproduced in
 ithe following pages and my readers may judge for
 themselves as to the veracity of the author and
 the importance of its revelations which are now
 made public for the first time the narrative writ-
 ten legibly in some dark colored medium upon a
 peculiar parchment-like and exceedingly tough
 though light material covered many sheets and
  was as follows

beyond the pole

        by a hyatt verill

	whosoever finds this message-i en-
treat that you will read and after read-
ing will either notify the relatives and
friends of myself and my comrades
of the crew of the bark endeavor
of new bedford in the state of massachusetts
u s a of the fate of
that vessel and her men
or failing in this will give
this writing to some reli-
able newspaper in order
that it may be published
for the benefit and peace
of mind of all who have
an interest in the fate of
the bark which set sail
from new bedford on the
fourteenth day of august



 my name is franklin
bishop and i was born and
resided at fairhaven

mass across the harbor
from new bedford for
many years i followed
the sea as a whaleman
until in  i shipped
as first mate on the bark
endeavor captain rank-
lin bound for the south
shetland islands in search
of sea-elephant oil the
price of oil having greatly
increased owing to the war the bark carried a
crew of sixteen men six of whom were portugese
boat-steerers shipped at funchal

  i cannot now recall the names or homes of the
crew if indeed i ever knew them for a large
number were greenies-human derelicts and were
known aboard ship only by their christian or their
nicknames the skipper was george rankin of
new london ct the second mate was jacob

marten of noank ct the cooper was nicholas
chester of mystic ct and the carpenter was a
huge raw boned scandinavian named olaf john-
son but the names matter little for i have no
doubt that even after six years the barks owners
or the new bedford shipping lists of  can
supply the names of all
hands with the exception
of the portuguese and i
mention the above merely
to prove the truth of my
tale and to induce who-
ever finds it to make
known the fate of the
bark and of her crew
our voyage after leav-
ing funchal was pleasant
and with favorable winds
and good weather we
made a quick run until
south of tristan da cunha
when we ran into heavy
weather with a north-
east gale that forced us
to shorten sail to almost
bare poles even then
the old bark wallowed
heavily and made such bad
weather of the sharp
irregular seas that we at
last were forced to heave
to and even to use oil over
the bows this made
the ship ride easier but our drift was tremendous
and when on the fifth day we managed to take
sights we found ourselves far off our course and in
latitude about  south and longitude  west
the exact figures i do not remember

  we had scarcely made sail and gotten on our
course when another and even harder gale bore
down upon us from the northwest and under bare
poles we scudded before it for sixty hours when

see footnote on next page

 t-tere is one of the most gripping stories that it has
  ever been our good fortune to read at the same
 time it is one of the best scientifiction works of the mod-
 ern school that we have lately seen it is easily the best
 scientifiction story of this year

   the author in choosing a civilization of lobster-like
 people should not be accused of sketching an impossi-
 bility indeed it is impossible to say at this moment in
 zvhat form an intelligent reasoning creature might or
 might not exist just because we have never met a reas-
 oning creature different from a human being tells noth-
 ing and we certainly should not be so arrogant as to
 think that intelligence as we know it combined with
 reasoning exists solely in the human type

   so far we have not been able to penetrate the secrets
 of ant life or of the bee life despite our so-called in-
 telligence so we should not judge too harshly what is
 and what is not possible when it comes to reasoning in-
 telligence

   in nature we know that everything is repeated-not
 only once but thousands of times why should reasoning
 intelligence be represented only in one speciest

   at any rate zve know that somehow you mil feel that
 beyond the pole is a real story where real facts are
 given to you for what they are worth it is an engros-
 sing story that cannot fail to grip you from start to finish
beyond the pole



by the hardest work we managed to set a patch of
sail and heaved the bark to

  hour after hour the storm howled through the
rigging while with aching backs and straining
arms we toiled at the pumps day and night

  gradually the wind died down and intense cold
followed with murky leaden skies and occasional
squalls of snow while between these puffs the wind
fell flat and we drifted helplessly about at the will
of the strong and unknown currents of the region
for five long weary days we drifted the sky be-
coming more and more sullen and with no gleam
of sunlight to enable us to make an observation

  on the sixth day long oily rollers came running
in from the west with a weight that told of wind
to follow and sails were close reefed in readiness
for the expected blow at last upon the horizon
we saw a streak of white gleaming against the
inky murk and hardly had we grasped rails and
rigging when the hurricane and blinding sleet and
snow struck us over the old bark went until it
seemed as if her yards would trip in the mountain-
ous seas that rushed past her bulwarks then
gradually she righted and bearing off before the
wind tore through the huge seas like a mad thing
for ten hours the gale screeched and howled with
undiminished fury and every effort to bring the
bark into the wind was useless moreover the hail
and snow was so thick that we could see barely a
cables length from the ship while rigging and
spars were loaded with tons of ice and to handle
ropes was like hauling on steel bars then sud-
denly from aloft came the piercing cry ice ahead
port your helm for gods sake hard a port

  springing to the wheel i threw all my weight
upon it but even with the two men already there
we were unable to swing the bark half a point and
a second later with a grinding crash we struck
the berg

  so great was the shock that all hands were
thrown flat upon the deck and with a splintering
roar the fore- and mainmasts went over the side
dragging the port bulwarks with them and staving
a gaping hole in the barks side as the jagged butts
lurched up on the next sea

  instantly all was confusion the portugese
rushed to the boats only to find that all but two
were staved in and tried to cut away the falls
luckily the ropes were so sheathed in ice that for
a moment they could not lower the boats and in
this brief space of time the captain and myself
with the other officers managed to drive the
crazed fellows from the boats and to restore some
sort of order

foot note by dr lyman

   the following is a clipping from the new bedford mercury of
august th  sailed bark endeavor rankin for pough
south georgia and south shetland islands via funchal it is with
pleasure that we note the sailing of the old whaleship endeavor
this is the first of new bedfords once great fleet of whalers to set sail
for the south atlantic in many years and we trust that it signifies an
awakening of the long dormant industry which once made the name of
new bedford familiar in every corner of the world it is a direct out-
come of the great war and the consequent advance in the price of oil
and while the latter may be and no doubt is only temporary our still
serviceable old ships may yet reap golden harvests while high prices
continue the endeavors officers are well known and experienced
men and we wish them and the owners every success and a greasy
vyage the endeavors officers arc as follows captain george
rankin of new london first mate frank bishop fairhaveti second

and blacksmith olaf johnson christiana sweden cook wm outer-

  provisions and water were thrown into the boats
but the bark was settling so rapidly that before
the craft were half provisioned captain rankin de-
cided it would be certain death to wait longer ac-
cordingly the boats were lowered away at once but
as i looked at the huge seas and felt the sweep of
the icy gaie i turned back and chose to risk going
down with the ship rather than add my weight to
the overburdened boats that i judged would scarce-
ly live an hour in the terrific welter of sea and
wind

  in this decision i was joined by olaf the car-
penter and standing upon the rapidly sinking hulk
we saw the two tiny whaleboats shove off and dis-
appear in the sleet and snow to leeward we
momentarily expected the ark to sink beneath us
and our only hope was that we might have time to
build some sort of makeshift raft before the vessel
went down with this idea we at once commenced
to gather what materials we could but long be-
fore we had secured even a small part of what we
required the bark had settled until the deck was
only a few inches above the water then suddenly
she lurched to port rolled over on her beam ends
and with a slight shudder remained motionless ex-
cept for a slight rising and falling on the waves
for a moment we were amazed and puzzled and
could not understand the matter for i knew hun-
dreds of fathoms of water lay under our keel
presently however we came to grasp the situation
evidently the berg on which we struck projected
far under water like a huge shelf and oqr ship
passing over this before she struck had now settled
until she rested on the submerged ice shelf for
the time we were safe and although the bark rested
in such a slanting position that we were obliged
to crawl rather than walk the decks yet we thanked
god that we were there instead of tossing about
in small boats at the mercy of the tempest

  as nothing was to be gained by remaining on
deck we entered the cabin and secured food and
drink and succeeded in belaying the cabin stove so
that we could light a fire which proved most grate-
ful to our chilled and numbed bodies here we
sat and smoked for uncounted hours while dimly
the sound of storm and waves came to us or the
grating of the barks keel upon the ice beneath
gave us momentary frights gradually the storm
waned and the waves broke less heavily against our
crippled ship towards daybreak we both fell
asleep and did not awaken until aroused by the
cold which became terrific as the fire died down
we kindled a new fire and wrapping ourselves in
heavy coats and oilskins went on deck the sun
was shining brightly close to the horizon but as
far as eye could see there was nothing but gleam
ing ice floes breken by narrow open lanes of dark
water and lofty bergs by watching certain spots
we soon found that we were drifting rapidly south-
ward and i went below to secure my sextant and
take an observation to my chagrin i found that
the captain had taken the instruments with him and
we were without means to learn our position except
by guess-work by careful calculation of our drift
and assuming that we had been drifting at the
same speed and in the same direction sincc striking
the ice and allowing for our progress since taking
the last observation i decided that our latitude and
	amazing stories

longitude must be about  south and  east
the cold was now so intense that we descended to
the cabin only occasionally venturing on deck to
meet with the same weary drifting broken ice
our case seemed hopeless indeed for we well knew
that we were far beyond the tracks of any ships and
that unless some miracle occurred we were doomed
to spend the rest of our days upon the helpless
wreck to perish miserably of starvation with
such thoughts we turned in at night and for six
days our existence was but a repetition of the first

 on the morning of the seventh day we were
startled by a roaring grinding noise and the sudden
violent lurching of the bark rushing on deck and
fearing the worst we were thunderstruck to behold
b-barely a cables length away-a rocky ice-capped
shore behind which rose lofty mountains with their
eummits hidden in clouds much to our surprise
also we found that the weather had greatly moder-
ated and several big mollymokes were wheeling
about the ship while seals and sea-leopards basked
on the rocks above the surf our ice cradle pre-
vented the bark taking the ground but in the course
of a few moments we managed to scramble over the
intervening broken ice and soon stepped upon the
shingle then with ropes and hawsers we suc-
ceeded in making our wreck fast to the shore we
were now reasonably sure that the ship would not
go adrift and even if a storm came up and forced
us to desert our quarters on board we could no
doubt salvage enough from the wreck to build some
manner of craft in which to make our escape from
this forbidding and uncharted land

  during the next two or three weeks we busied
ourselves carrying ashore fuel and provisions and
in constructing a little hut or shelter in which to
store the goods or to seek refuge in case of disaster
to the bark

  there was no lack of fresh meat for penguins
albatross mollymokes and cape pigeons were thick
also we laid in a fine supply of seal skins and oil
an preparation for the long and dreary winter which
we knew we should be forced to face for we had no
intentions of trusting ourselves to any frail craft
we might be able to build until all chances of whale-
ships reaching us had passed with the summer
although this work kept us busy and left us little
time to think of our plight yet often during meals
or when done with the days work we talked over
the probable fates of our comrades and were grate-
ful at our own salvation even in such an inhospitable
land

chapter ii

as winter approached however olaf became
very sullen and morose often talking to him-
self and wandering about the rocks gesticul-
ating and acting strangely

  i became afraid that the poor fellow would lose
his mind completely and as on many occasions he
turned upon me savagely i was constantly on the
alert to protect myself he had been a wonderful
help for his skill with tools had enabled us to
build a comfortable house and without him i would
have fared badly indeed

  it was several months after landing that in one
of his fits of wandering he fell among slippery
rocks and broke his thigh i did not find him until
several hours after the accident and twixt loss of
blood and the pain and the piercing cold he was
past all human help and quite unconscious

  i carried him to the hut and did all in my power
for my suffering shipmate but it was useless early
the following morning he died and with heavy
heart at the loss of my only companion i carried
his body to a crevice in the hillside and covered it
well with stones and gravel and over it placed
a small wooden cross on which i carved his name
and the date of his death

  i now became most despondent for i knew that
alone i could never hope to complete the boat we
had been working on and that even if that were
possible i would be powerless to handle or navigate
it i could see nothing but the endless winter and
utter loneliness before me with ultimate death
through accident or madness unless by some remote
chance a sail hove in sight

  in my calmer moments i held to this slender hope
and tried to conjure up all the tales i had heard of
castaways living for years alone and yet being
rescued in the end i had little fear of meeting with
an accident as long as i kept my mind and i real-
ized that my greatest danger lay in going mad as
olaf had done to avoid this as much as possible
and to prevent my thoughts from dwelling on my
plight i commenced taking long trips across the
hills in search of game carrying a supply of am-
munition and a haversack filled with biscuit or
dried meat on one of these tramps i had wandered
several miles from the hut and had reached the
summit of a good sized hill from which i had a
wide view of the sea far down the shore i noticed
some object about which great flocks of sea fowl
were gathering and thinking it a stranded whale or
sea elephant i turned my steps towards the spot
as i rounded a point of rocks and came within plain
sight of the object i almost dropped in my tracks
from sheer amazement upon the beach before me
was a ships boat

  i broke into a run and panting reached the craft
from which hundreds of mollymokes and other birds
rose screaming gaining the boats side i peered
within and recoiled in horror stretched upon the
thwarts and bottom were the bodies of six men
their faces torn and mutilated by the sea birds but
even in their ghastly state i knew them for cap-
tain rankin and my former shipmates of the en-
deavor i reeled away for the sight was sickening
and stunning and seized with insane and unreas-
oning fright i dropped my gun and dashed off
beyond the pole



across the rocks and hills striving with might and
main to get as far from the gruesome boat as pos-
sible

  at last i dropped from sheer exhaustion among
the rocks but even then the shock was so great
that i hid my face and screamed and raved like a
madman until consciousness left me

  how long i remained in that condition i cannot
say for when at last i awoke to a knowledge of my
surroundings i found myself wandering about amid
thick and thorny scrub on a steep hillside i had
never seen before i was ravenously hungry and
thrust my hand into my haversack in search of
food only to find it empty save for a few crumbs
of ships bread seating myself on a nearby rock i
munched these eagerly and tried to collect my
thoughts and reason i soon came to the conclusion
that i had been delirious for a long time and dur-
ing my period of temporary madness had wandered
far for my haversack had been full when i first
sighted the boat and was now empty and i reasoned
that i must have devoured my food during my un-
conscious wanderings my watch had stopped but
this mattered little as for months i had been able
merely to guess at the time a search of my pock-
ets failed to reveal my compass but i felt this was
no great loss at the time for i had no doubt that
by climbing a neighboring hill i could make out
the sea and so find my way back to the hut al-
though i confess that the mere thought of again
approaching the ghastly remains of my shipmates
filled me with most awful dread and caused me to
shudder violently

  my tongue and throat were parched and dry and
the hard crumbs of biscuit added to my thirst so i
at once commenced to push my way up the hillside
through the shrubbery as i reached the top and
looked about no gleaming bit of sea greeted my
eyes on every side stretched rolling round-topped
hills each and all clothed in dull brownish-gray
scrub save just behind me where the more distant
landscape was hidden from view by a higher range
of small mountains although my thirst was now
unbearable yet i knew that my one hope of finding
my way was to ascend the higher hill and with
sinking heart and lagging footsteps i started for
them slowly and painfully i climbed their rough
and rocky slopes stopping often to rest and regain
my failing breath but at last i stood upon their
crest and gazed anxiously about the horizon for
a moment my head swam and a mist floated before
my eyes then my vision cleared and i saw before
me a long sloping hillside covered with scattered
shrubs while below and stretching far towards the
horizon was a green and pleasant valley on whose
farther edge rose high and rugged mountains misty
with distance but though no water gladdened my
eyes yet near at hand i saw a number of great birds
resembling penguins and towards these i rapidly
made my way they were stupid and fearless and
in a moment i had killed the first one i reached and
greedily drank its rick warm blood this refreshed
me greatly but feeling still hungry i gathered a
quantity of eggs which i ate raw and feeling
drowsy made my way to a sheltered nook among the
rocks and fell into a deep and dreamless sleep

  i awoke feeling strong but half famished and at
once fell to on the helpless birds and their eggs i

now considered my next step and as there evidently
was nothing to be gained by retracing my way i
decided to travel towards the valley where i judged
perhaps water might be found for although the
blood and raw eggs had somewhat quenched my
thirst yet the desire for water was overpowering
as i did not know if i would find more birds farther
on i laid in a good supply of flesh and eggs and as
i noticed that my shoes were almost worn out i
wrapped birds skins about my feet binding them
in place with strips of the skin

  i now noticed that these birds were not penguins
as i had at first thought nor in fact anything like
any birds i had even before seen i judged there-
fore that i was far from the coast but i was wholly
without means of ascertaining the dix-ection of the
sea or my position for i had seen nothing of the
sun since finding the boat although the days were
bright enough as i thought on this its strange-
ness came to me and i also marveled that i was not
suffering from the cold the more i thought of
these matters the more i wondered for now that i
came to think of it the weather was quite warm
and i had seen no snow or ice even among the crev-
ices of the rocks but i had other things to occupy
my attention for my thirst for water and my desire
to escape from my surroundings filled my head to
the exclusion of all less pressing matters as for
hour after hour i tramped on across the valley
from the hilltop it had appeared clothed in soft
grass but when i reached it i found to my sorrow
that the vegetation was thorny pointed-leaf shrubs
whose tangled branches formed an almost impene-
trable jungle which made my progress painful and
slow beyond belief i soon lost all sense of time or
direction but toiled on towards the distant mount-
tains eating the birds flesh and eggs when hungry
and at last sinking down to sleep when my tired
and torn flesh refused to carry me farther on my
way only by looking at the hills behind me could
i see that i had made any progress towards the
mountains which seemed as distant as ever but
gradually the hills grew dim in the distance while
ahead the mountains became more distinct and
great seams and patches of vegetation appeared up-
on their slopes it was well for me that i had laid in
a supply of meat and eggs for i saw no sign of life
on the dreary plain except one great beast that ap-
peared like a gigantic lizard or iguana in fact so
monstrous was the creature that i feared my brain
had gone adrift again and that it was but a vision
of delirium the beast appeared more afraid of
me than i of him however and so little interest
did i have in anything save the desire for water and
to reach the farther side of the valley that i doubt
if i would have turned aside or would have fled even
though the devil himself had confronted me cer-
tain it is that the presence of this huge creature-
i would say he was forty feet in length-did not
prevent me from dropping off to sleep as usual that
night

  at last my provisions became perilously low and
when finally i reached the bases of the mountains i
was reduced to two eggs while my makeshift boots
were gone entirely and my garments were merely
a few dirty rags and shreds to climb those rugged
mountains seemed utterly beyond my power but i
noticed a sort of cut or ravine a half mile or so dis-


amazing stories

tant and thinking this might be a pass through the
mountains i dragged myself toward it it was a
deep fissure and extended far up the mountain side
and while it made the climb a bit easier i soon
found that the task was far greater than i had ex-
pected and only by the utmost efforts could i force
my way upward but some unknown force or in-
stinct seemed to drag me on and even when my last
egg had been devoured i did not despair but strug-
gled and found my way foot by foot over the rocks
and boulders and through patches of low scrub un-
til almost fainting from hunger and thirst i came
to another colony of the strange birds on these i
feasted until satisfied and while resting and tying
more of the bird-skins on my bruised and swollen
feet i found time to give some thought to my sur-
roundings

  i had often heard of the theory of a vast antarc-
tic continent and although i of course knew that
shackleton had found the south pole still i was
now convinced that i had passed the pole and was
on this unknown land

  but the fact that the weather was warm puzzled
me immensely while quite beyond my understand-
ing was the fact that i had seen no glimpse of the
sun on my long tramp across the plain no theory
however wild and impossible would account yor
this for it was not dark but as bright as any ant-
arctic day and neither could i understand how es-
pecially without the sun i could feel comfortably
warm at last giving up the puzzle in despair i
gathered up my load of birds and eggs and once
more started on

  and here it may be well to explain why i was
able to think upon such matters which are usually
beyond the mind of a sailor and how as will be
seen later i happened to have a knowledge of many
matters such as science mechanics and similar
things of which the sailor or whaleman as a rule
knows nothing for several years i had been an of-
ficer on one of the ships of the united states fish
commission and from the scientists engaged in
deep sea research i had learned a great deal about
natural history which interested me always and
learning for the first time that specimens of animal
life minerals and plants had a cash value i secured
a commission from one of the museums to collect
specimens on my whaling voyages to distant parts
of the world this led me to study works on science
and through long arctic nights i filled my brain
with all manner of knowledge relating to geology
zoology botany and other similar matters

  also i had always been fond of mechanics and
as the whaling industry waned ahd the demand for
sailors decreased in the merchant service i bent my
energies to acquiring a knowledge of machinery
so that i might secure a berth on some steam or
motor-propelled craft in doing this i became ab-
sorbed in the matter and found vast interest in
reading all manner of books and magazines treating
of the latest inventions and discoveries in the me-
chanical world of course i had little practical
knowledge of these things but the theories were
fixed in my mind and as it proved later were of
great value to me

  but to resume my narrative long and weary
as my tramp across the plain had been tenfold
worse was the never ending upward climb towards

the cloud-piercing summits of the mountains my
days were measured only by my waking moments
for the light never ceased and my labor was only
marked by long periods of panting heartbreaking
toil and periods of deep sleep and while to keep
some sort of track of the hours i had started my
watch yet this gave me no real time but merely
served to let my enow how long i slept and how long
i toiled upwards five days of this labor had again
worn my makeshift footgear to pieces and had re-
duced my provisions to my last egg when i reached
the summit of the mountains and falling exhausted
upon the bare and wind-swept rocks looked down
upon the farther side

  at my first glance my heart gave a great throb
of joy and i thanked heaven that i had been led on
to the summit spreading from the base of the
mountains was a wide level plain covered with rich
and verdant green while far away gleaming like
silver in the bright light stretched a vast expanse
of water

  forgetting my sore torn feet and my utter ex-
haustion i rose and dashed forward down the slope
stumbling over boulders tripped by vines and
shrubs falling sliding and scrambling i reached
the bottom in a few hours and dashed into the lux-
uriant grass that rose higher than my head here
my strength failed me and falling upon the earth
i felt utterly unable to rise again

  presently i heard a slight rustling sound in the
grass near me and glancing up beheld a strange
animal staring at me in wonder but evidently with-
out the least fear thinking only to secure some-
thing to eat i managed to stagger to my feet and
started towards the animal i had no weapon ex-
cept my knife but the beast stood his ground until
i was within a few feet when by a sudden spring
i reached his side and driving my knife into his
throat brought him down in my famished state
his blood and raw warm meat were as welcome as
the daintiest food and having satisfied myself i
fell asleep beside his partially devoured carcass

  several hours later i awoke feeling much strong-
er and looked more closely at the beast whose fort-
unate appearance had saved my life i found hins
to be a sort of huge rat or mouse-although i had
at first mistaken him for a small deer-and my
stomach turned a bit at the thought that i had
actually eaten his flesh i now became conscious of
a peculiar quality in the air that i had not noticed
before at first i was puzzled to account for it
but gradually i realized that the light had become
intensely blue instead of white or yellow it was
like looking through a blue-tinted glass and for the
first time i noticed that my hands and knife and
even the face of my watch appeared bluish and
strange my longing for water however was too
great to allow me to give mueh thought to the matter
and turning from the dead animal-for hungry a
i was i could not force myself to eat more of him-i
started on in the direction of the water i had seen
from the mountain top the grass grew close and
was very dry and gave off a dusty choking material
or pollen which filled my eyes nose and mouth and
each moment increased my thirst and dried and
blistered my aching parched throat but gradually
the grass became thinner and now and then i caught
glimpses of small creatures ahd birds that fled be-
beyond the pole



fore me while the ground under my feet became
less dry and parched until presently the damp
sweet smell of water reached me a moment later
i burst through the last of the grass and saw be-
fore me a sandy beach lapped by tiny waves whose
sound was the most welcome thing i had ever heard
rushing across the beach i threw myself face
down at the waters edge with a sickening fear
that the water might be salt but my first taste
reassured me and burying my face and hands in
the waves i drank until i felt sick and nauseated
when crawling up the beach on all fours i drew
myself into the shelter of the grass and lost con-
sciousness

chapter 

slowly i opened my eyes and as i did so i
screamed aloud with terror and wonder
standing over me was a fearsome terrible
creature that he was not a man i knew at my first
glance and yet there was something that resembled
a man about him but so terribly monstrous weird
and incredible so utterly inhuman that i felt sure
i must be dreaming or out of my senses he or it
was fully eight feet in height standing on two legs
like a man and seemingly clad from head to foot in
some soft downy material that glistened with a
thousand colors like the throat of a humming bird
or the tints on a soap bubble above the shoulders
was a large elongated pointed head with a wide
mouth and a long pointed snout from the fore-
head projected long stalks or horns and on the tip
of each of these was an unwinking gleaming eye
like the eyes of a crab in place of eyebrows two
long slender jointed fleshy tentacles drooped down
over the creatures shoulders while the ears were
long soft and pendulous like those of a hound
there was no hair upon the head but instead a
number of brilliant shining scales or plates lap-
ping one over the other from the forehead to the
nape of the neck

  no wonder i was horrified and startled at this
apparition and as i gazed upon the thing and saw
that it possessed three pairs of long many-jointed
arms i shrieked again at the monstrosity of it at
my cry and my terrified actions the creature raised
one hand in a reassuring gesture and i was further
horrified to see that in place of fingers the arm end-
ed in a mass of delicate various-shaped appendages
of several sizes that reminded me of the soft legs
on the belly of a crawfish or shrimp i shrank away
as far as possible but the being seemed to smile
his stalked eyes drew back into his head and he ut-
tered some strange sounds in a low soft tone which
i judge were words of greeting or reassurance al-
though to my ears they meant nothing

  finding i did not respond-for i was still too
dazed and frightened to utter a sound-the thing
stooped and extended a small object towards me it
resembled a ships biscuit in form and size and as
i hesitated to take it the creature pointed to his
own mouth and nodded evidently meaning i was
to eat it i had no difficulty in grasping this mean-
ing and famished as i was rather hesitatingly
took the object and greedily devoured it in taste
it was slightly sweet with a rather pleasant arom-
atic flavor and i at once signed my desire for more
my weird friend for i now knew that despite his

fearful appearance the creature was well disposed
towards me handed me two more of the biscuits
and as he did so i had a chance to look more closely
at his hands they were truly remarkable each
of the dozen or more finger-like digits was of a dis-
tinct form and size some were large strong and
blunt others slender and pointed others with pin-
cer-like tips while still others were divided at the
extremities into several filaments almost as fine as
hairs marvelous and repulsive as they seemed yet
i could not help realizing even then what wonder-
ful work such hands might accomplish if they were
controlled by intelligence and muscles as perfect as
mans and yet my wildest ideas of such things fell
far short of the reality

  seating himself or i might say sprawling him-
self beside me the thing watched me munch the
biscuit and i in turn gazed at him with the utmost
curiosity as i had now partially overcome my dread
i now saw that what i had mistaken for clothing
was in reality a growth upon the skin a material
something like wool and yet something like feathers
the feet too i found were as strange as the rest
of the body or the hands for in place of toes they
bore round-tipped digits covered with saucer-shaped
suckers like those upon the tentacles of an octopus
or squid

  undoubted i was as great a marvel to him as he
was to me for i could see that his surprise at my
appearance was tremendous his long flexible feel-
ers rose and fell about me-though not touching
me for which i was thankful-his eyes turned and
moved up and down as he looked me over from head
to foot and presently realizing i no longer feared
him he extended one hand and very gently passed
it over my clothing i shuddered at the first touch
but as one of the appendages or fingers touched my
flesh and i found it soft and warm and not cold or
clammy as i had expected my revulsion became
less still the sensation of being handled or touched
by the horribly formed thing was creepy and i had
to use all my will to avoid drawing back evident-
ly he was greatly surprised at the result of his
examination and gazed at me more intently than
ever meanwhile uttering low strange words or
sounds that reminded me of the purring of a cat
with a little of the rasping metallic sound of a
cricket

  presently seeing i had eaten the last of the
biscuits the creature rose to his two hind feet
folded two other pairs of limbs under his body and
beckoning with the fourth pair or as i might call
them his arms made me understand that i was to
follow him filled with curiosity to know what
wonders lay before me and feeling sure the crea-
ture was friendly and peaceable i also rose and to
my amazement found that all my health and
strength had returned in a most miraculous man-
ner i was as refreshed light hearted and free
from aches soreness or pain as ever in my life and
as i walked with springy buoyant steps after the
weird being my mind was filled with wonder
surely i thought the three small biscuits could
not have stayed my ravenous appetite and given
me such strength and yet there was no other way
to account for it but whatever the reason my
troubles were over for the present i had water in
plenty before me the creature leading the way


amazing stories

across the beach could provide food and whatever
the future might hold or wherever i might be i
would not die of thirst or starvation while the in-
credible giant was friendly and apparently wished
to help me

  i had no doubt that he was leading me to some
house or settlement and i was filled with curiosity
to see what manner of creatures dwelt in this
strange land that they would be most interesting i
felt sure for i knew that hitherto the antarctic
had been thought uninhabited by man and i wond-
ered if they would resemble eskimos indians or
south sea islanders that they should have dom-
esticated such strangely weird creatures as the
being who was guiding me proved not only that
they were intelligent but that i might expect other
and perhaps even greater surprises while the fact
that this monstrosity was so kindly and well dis-
posed assured me that his masters would treat me
with consideration it was all very dream-like and
had it not been for my ragged garments my thorn-
torn and bruised flesh and my sore feet i should
have felt sure that it was all a figment of my over-
wrought brain for it was almost too incredible to
be true i had set out from the desolate forbidding
shores of the antarctic within a few degrees of the
south pole and here i was in a land as mild and
pleasant as new england in june the sea-or what
i took to be the sea-was fresh pure water the bril-
liant sunshine which should not have existed at all
in this spot was pale blue instead of white and
before me strode a creature such as no mortal man
had ever seen save in some nightmare or the deliri-
um of fever or drink while to me at the time the
most incredible thing of all was the fact that after
eating three small dry biscuits i had regained all
my strength and felt as fresh-with the exception
of my blistered feet-as ever in my life	

  we had walked along the beach for some time
and i was beginning to wonder how much farther
we must travel when we rounded a bend and i saw
a peculiar object resting on the sand a few yards
ahead of us it was about fifty feet in length about
ten feet in diameter cylindrical and with pointed
ends resembling in a way a gigantic cigar in the
bluish light it shone with the brilliant lustre of
metal but with a peculiar purplish sheen that was
unlike any metal i had ever seen as we approached
this object i halted in my tracks with gaping
mouth and staring incredulous eyes a door had
opened in the affair and from the aperture two
more of the weirdly horrible looking creatures had
appeared in every detail they were exactly like my
guide except that one was mueh smaller and was
covered with a pale pinkish coat of down or feath-
ers or whatever the material might be called in-
stantly i was aware of a peculiar vibrating hum-
ming sound and noticed that my companions feelers
or antennae had risen erect above his head and were
moving slowly gracefully back and forth as were
the feelers of the two other creatures but no word
or sound that could be thought speech issued from
any of the three

  a moment later we were beside the great cylin-
drical object and the two beings who had been with-
in it were gazing at me with the greatest wonder
and interest their stalked eyes were moving this
way and that studying me from head to foot their

feelers were vibrating with excitement their lop-
ears were waving like the ears of an elephant and
presently with queer low sounds from their lips
they stretched out their jointed limbs and rather
hesitatingly and cautiously touched my garments
with their many digited hands or feet whichever
they might be called

  i was i admit most uneasy and not a little
frightened and had a peculiar sense of repulsion as
the creatures approached close to me and their
tentacles played about my face and their soft finger-
like extremities caressed my tattered clothing
but i knew that for the present at least i had no
real cause for alarm for they seemed really gentle
creatures but if my readers-provided this
manuscript ever finds a reader-can imagine stand-
ing beside three immense crayfish larger than any
giant of a dime museum they can perhaps in a
measure realize the sensations that went over me

  even so i found myself wondering if the huge
cylinder before me was the dwelling of these weird
things if it was a sort of shell-like house and if
the three were the only denizens of this unknown
land or if there were more of their kind but i
instantly dismissed the thought they were merely
strangely developed remarkably intelligent beasts
and it was inconceivable that they should have con-
structed the metallic affair from which they had
emerged in fact the presence of this convinced
me that there were human beings not far distant
and that the creatures beside me were merely
guarding the metallic object and awaiting their
masters return moreover the fact that this huge
metal cigar-like thing was there proved beyond
doubt that the men who dwelt in the land were no
primitive savages but intelligent and civilized al-
though what the purpose of the thing was was
quite beyond me possibly i thought it was some
sort of boat-for it looked much like one of the
floats to a metal life raft-perhaps a submarine
but there were no signs of rudders fins propellers
or other external fittings on its smooth surface and
aside from the door or port from which the two
creatures had emerged no opening or aperture in
the metal as far as i could see

  but i had little time for thought on such mat-
ters their first curiosity satisfied my guide ges-
tured for me to follow and entered the big cylinder
with the other two following in my footsteps
scarcely knowing what to expect i passed through
the door and glanced about i was in a long room
or hallway illuminated by a strange luminous glow
and an exclamation of the utmost amazement
escaped my lips as i discovered that the walls of
the cylinder were as transparent as glass stand-
ing there i could see the beach the stretch of
water the green fringe of grass and bushes as
clearly as though i were in the open air and yet
from without the interior of the contrivance had
been utterly invisible

  this was astounding enough but before i could
fully appreciate the wonder of it there were more
bewildering matters to fill my brain the interior
held no machinery the only fittings in sight being
couch-like benches rugs or carpets and an affair at
one end which at first glance i took to be a buffet or
bar for it bore a number of shining metallic and
glass-like utensils above and behind it was a
beyond the pole



panel or rectangle covered with strange dials and
instruments and as we entered and the door closed
behind us with a slight metallic clink the creature
who had first found me approached this buffet-like
arrangement reaching out his arms he moved
certain things upon the panel with his other limbs
he touched the utensils on the piece of furniture
before him instantly there was a strange musical
humming which rose swiftly to a whirring sound
like the muffled noise of machinery and glancing
through the transparent sides of the cylinder i
was dumbfounded to see the beach and the water
swiftly dropping from beneath us for a moment
i could not understand and then with a shock at
the discovery i realized that we were mounting up-
ward with incredible speed within the space of a
few seconds we were several hundred feet above the
beach and the next instant my bewildered senses
grasped the fact that we were hurtling through the
air like a bullet from a rifle

   almost before i knew it the beach and the grassy
plain beyond it were dim in the distance the faintly
outlined waves upon the water seemed to rush back-
ward and yet there was not the least movement ap-
preciable within the transparent cylinder and al-
though i could see the entire interior from where i
stood there was no sign of machinery no hint of
engines of whirring wheels or shafts it was ab-
solutely impossible and incredible within a cigar-
shaped cylinder which even if made of aluminum
would have weighed tons i was being hurled
through space by invisible means controlled by the
indescribably strange creatures beside me

   i peered ahead for i knew that we must be bound
for some definite goal and saw land rising rapidly
into view upon the horizon each second it became
clearer a low shore backed by hills deliciously green
and bathed in the blue light that flooded everything
and as the land grew rapidly more distinct bright
shining dots appeared among the greenery and pre-
sently above the waters edge an immense town or
city lay spread at the speed at which we were
traveling we would be there within fifteen minutes
and as i glanced to right and left i saw a score of
craft similar to the one i was in all rushing through
the air like monstrous gleaming cannon shells
like streaks of light they crossed our path above or
below us to right and left they passed some were
tiny things scarcely ten feet in length others
gigantic affairs several hundred feet in length but
all moving noiselessly with incredible speed driven
by some unseen incomprehensible terrific power
below us now the water was dotted with the
strange vessels their shimmering hulls if such i
may call them resting on the surface or skittering
along slowly and leaving foamy wakes across the
little waves then we were dropping descending
as lightly as a bit of thistle down and almost
under my feet i saw the outlying buildings of the
town so rapidly did we drop that at the time i
had no chance to note the form or details of the
buildings except to see that they were of strange
design and color but even in our swift fall in that
space of a few seconds i saw that the inhabitants
the beings who thronged the streets were no hu-
mans but one and all the same grotesque mon-
strous creatures as those beside me

chapter 

shocked as i was at this discovery i saw that
our arrival had been noticed and that froirj
every side hurrying down the streets swarm-
ing out of buildings the creatures were rushing
in a close packed mass towards a clear open space
like a broad level field which i judged was our
landing place the next moment our strange air-
ship was at rest and filled with unreasoning dread
trembling at thought of facing that horde of mon-
sters i followed my guides or captors which ever
they were through the door and stepped upon tho
firm earth once more all about the borders of
the field which i now saw was covered with cradle
like structures like the one in which our craft
rested the stalk-eyed misshapen beings had gath-
ered a maze of swaying undulating antennae of
tall pointed scale-covered heads and irridescent
bodies but not one attempted to approach or to
pass within the boundaries of the landing place

  hardly had i noticed this and wondered at it
when from one side a group of the monsters stepped
out at first glance they seemed no different from
the others but as they drew close i saw that they
were of a totally different color being a peculiar
violet-blue and that two pairs of their limbs or
arms ended in enormous vicious-looking claws or
nippers like those of a lobster even as i noticed
this they reached us and i shuddered as i thought
of how easily the creatures could crush and tear
me to bits with those fearful pincers with their
serrated teeth

  but for the present the claws were at rest and
closed and their owners made no hostile movement
forming on either side of my guides and myself
they marched beside us and before them the crowd
fell back leaving an open lane through which we
passed

  before us were buildings and for the first time
i obtained a clear view of the structures and gaped
almost as astonished at their appearance as i had
been at the monstrous forms of their owners from
high in air they had seemed low massive structures
with nothing particularly remarkable about them
but now close at hand i saw that they were unlike
anything i had ever seen although in a vague way
they reminded me of gigantic igloos windowless
they rose like domes of dull-gray above the earth
the only apertures in their walls dark yawning
arched doorways towards one of which my guards
were marching as we entered the portal my pass-
ing glance showed me that the affairs were not of
mud or clay as i had thought at first but were
constructed of small stones and pebbles cemented
together with some hard tenacious material giving
them the effect of being hewn from coarse pudding
stone or as i believe geologists call it conglomerate
rock

  the next instant we were within the entrance and
were descending a steep incline so sharp was thei
slope that the skin coverings on my feet slipped
my feet shot out from under me and with a startled
cry i went sliding and rolling through the semi-
darkness like a bale of cargo down a chute how
far i might have gone or where i might have
brought up i cannot say for with incredible agility
two of the monsters overtook me and with theiij


amazing stories

weird limbs-which made me shudder as they
touched me-brought me to a halt and helped me to
my feet

  despite the confusion and my predicament i had
noticed that the creatures when in a hurry ran
along on all fours or rather i might say on all
eights and i realized that the sucker-like disks on
their feet enabled them to navigate the steep pas-
sage without the least danger of slipping

  no doubt my mishap seemed very amusing to
the strange beings but no sounds of merriment
came from them and to this moment i have never
heard anything that remotely resembled a laugh
or chuckle issue from the mouths of the creatures

  the whole affair yes everything that had occur-
red since i had seen the castaway boat with the
corpses of my dead shipmates was so dreamlike so
nightmarish that try as i might i could not con-
vince myself that i was awake and that the strange
events were actually taking place and that the be-
ings-intelligent reasoning possessing powers
and mechanical devices beyond anything dreamed
of by man and yet mere beasts or creatures of a
lower order-really existed and were not the crea-
tions of a disordered or wandering mind but my
fall was very real and as the creatures aided me to
rise and i ruefully rubbed my bruised and barked
limbs i knew that the tumble at least was no delir-
ium indeed i think that my mishap was the most
convincing thing that had occurred it is really
strange how little unimportant every day matters
are often of so much greater importance in our lives
than great events and all that i had undergone had
failed to impress me as much or to bring so vividly
to my mind the marvelous situation in which i
found myself as that tumble on the steep incline
leading through the darkness to the interior of
some subterranean chamber

  at the time however i had little opportunity to
give much thought to such matters before me a
dull light shone and a moment later we emerged
from the passage and entered a huge round cham-
ber although at my first sight of the place i
did not take in the details it may be as well to
describe it at this point of my narrative the floor
was smooth white and seemed made of some lumin-
ous material the walls glowed with dull light and
the high domed ceiling appeared as if of glass with
brilliant bluish light streaming through it

  about the walls was a low bench or shelf-like ar-
rangement covered with what appeared to be cush-
ions scattered about were curiously shaped chairs
or stools and in the centre was a sort of raised
dais or platform on which were several more seats
and a desk-like arrangement covered with dials and
instruments much like the affair i had already
seem in the airship and by means of which the
creatures handled the craft upon the bench about
the walls and seated on the other stools were
several dozen of the beings to whom i was now be-
coming accustomed in a general way they were
precisely like my guards and the creature i had
first met upon the distant beach but in details
they were different in fact no two were exactly
alike although it was not until long afterward that
i learned to distinguish the various differences
some of which were very minute they were of
all colors from white to nearly black although all

had the same peculiar metallic sheen i had already
noted and all likewise possessed eight limbs the
long-stalked eyes and the antennae already i
had been impressed with the striking resemblance
the creatures bore to giant crawfish but now as
i gazed about the huge chamber i had the feel-
ing that i was surrounded by huge crustaceans
possessed of intelligent reasoning brains pos-
sibly i cannot convey to my readers-if by the
will of god this narrative ever reaches human
beings--the weirdly impossible dreamlike and
in a way horrible sensations that swept over
me as i stared at the scaly heads the slowly
moving stalked eyes the waving undulating
antennae and the eight jointed limbs of these be-
ings and realized that here in this strange land
beyond the south pole evolution had proceeded in
a very amazing and very different manner to that
which had taken place in the world of men years
before i had read among my other books a work
by darwin on evolution and the survival of the
fittest although i had never fully accepted the
idea that mankind had descended or ascended from
some monkey-like ancestor still i could understand
how it might be possible and i had been convinced
that man as well as other members of the animal
kingdom had developed from other more primitive
forms and now as i stood within the illuminated
chamber it suddenly dawned upon my mind that
the creatures among whom my lot had been cast
actually proved darwins theory here before me
and all about me were beings no whit less intelligent
than human beings creatures who had conquered
space and time with incredible aircraft beings who
could converse without words and who i later found
were far in advance of man and yet who bore not
the remotest resemblance to humans to put the
matter in a few words just as men resemble highly
developed and advanced apes so these beings re-
sembled crustaceans if the human race had been
evolved from some ape-like creature then beyond
the shadow of a doubt these creatures had been
evolved from some lobster-like ancestor the dis-
covery came to me as a shock so accustomed are
we to think that intelligent reasoning civilized
beings must be moulded in human form that it
rather dazed me to find that the mere form of
body and limbs had nothing to do with it that the
mere chance that mans ancestors had been apes or
ape-like had led to the physical appearance of hu-
man beings and that had some other form of life
been the fittest to survive and had gone through
ages of evolution our world might have been peo-
pled by insects reptiles or any other creatures as
progressive intelligent and highly civilized as
ourselves

  here before me was the proof of this here
evolution had proceeded from cold-blooded spineless
crustaceans and the result was these shrimp-like
giants possessing powers beyond my own or those
of mankind of course at the time the full signi-
ficance of the matter did not come to me but as
time passed and i learned how immeasurably be-
yond man these creatures had advanced i became
more and more convinced that the accident of the
origin of the human race had been an unfortunate
rather than a fortunate thing for the world and
that had we been evolved from ants say we would
beyond the pole



have been much farther along the road to highest
attainments

  but i am digressing at the time i was really
more impressed by the curious discoveries i made
than by thoughts on evolution one of the first
things i noticed and which oddly enough had quite
escaped me hitherto was the fact that the creatures
possessed tails these were broad flat affairs com-
posed of overlapping plates or scales and which
usually remained folded like fans this no doubt
was the reason they had escaped my notice for
being of the same color and texture as the rest
of the bodies i had taken them for ornamental
pendant affairs portions of the garments which i
had thought the things wore for i had not yet dis-
covered that the feather-like covering of their bodies
was a natural growth

  now however i saw that when seated the tails
stuck stiffly out behind the creatures or in some
cases were cuiled around to one side and that they
moved to and fro opening and shutting in a most
fascinating manner some i noted also were far
larger than others and later i learned to disting-
uish the males and females by the form and size
of their tails

   of course all this which has taken so much time
to write down occupied but a few instants and my
eyes having swept about the chamber turned to
the dais in the center and the creatures who were
seated upon it

   these were taller more slender and more brilliant
in color than the others their heads were higher
broader and rounder their antennse were longer
and their eyes borne on long stalks like the others
seemed to me to have a more intelligent expression
if indeed such hard cold unwinking orbs were
capable of expression of any sort

  by intuition i knew that they were leaders or
rulers and that i was being brought before them
and somehow this almost human proceedure of be-
ing led by armed guards before a tribunal sur-
rounded by a curious crowd struck me as both
ludicrous and amazing

  that i was in danger never occurred to me
possibly it was because i had been through so much
that i was callous of danger or perhaps it was be-
cause man instinctively looks down upon inferior
races or creatures but whatever the reason al-
though i was fully aware that i was at their mercy
i felt no fear but rather was filled with interest and
curiosity as to what would occur indeed i felt
precisely as i have felt when in dreams i have
been dragged before a court to be tried for my life
on some ridiculous charge and knowing i might be
condemned to death yet i felt no dread of the re-
sults owing to a peculiar subconscious conviction
that i would escape harm and would awaken before
the actual execution took place

   also i was filled with a curiosity as to how the
hearing was to be conducted for while there was no
doubt that the creatures could converse readily
among themselves their words or whatever means
they used were inaudible to me and when they
uttered sounds as they did at times the almost
metallic noises were uttely unintelligible

  but i had far underestimated the uncanny in-
credible powers of the creatures suddenly i was
aware as one beoomes aware of some unseen person

gazing at one in a crowd that i was being question-
ed i cannot describe the sensation cannot make
it clear there was no sound nothing to tell me
that my ears were receiving any message and as a
matter of fact they were not

  and yet my brains or some unknown sense was
receiving a message questions which could they
be put into word might have been been expressed
as who are you  whence do you come what is
your purpose

  was i dreaming losing my senses going mad
from my past hardships and my amazing adven-
tures and then almost unconsciouly i found my-
self replying to the inaudible queries i was trying
to explain how i had been shipwrecked how i had
wandered across the mountains and had come to
this land and that my only purpose was if pos-
sible to return to ray own countiy

  and as i thus responded to the uncanny question
entering my brain without audible sounds i knew
from the actions of the strange beings that my
replies had been understood their antennse waved
and trembled excitedly they turned their stalked
eyes and gazed at one another and at myself and
they even uttered the queer metallic sounds which
always denoted great excitement

  it had been astounding enough to discover that
the creatures could make themselves understood
by some occult uncanny power but to find that i
could make my thoughts clear to them was almost
beyond reason how had it been accomplished
how was it possible for me a totally different be-
ing from another world to understand these strange
creatures and what was still more astonishing
more inexplicable yet how had i been able to trans-
fer my thoughts to their brains was it some
weird undreamed-of method of mental telepathy
hypnotism or what even if they possessed some
power some unknown means of making me under-
stand them i certainly had no such power and
yet i was convinced that i had made myself clear
to them or at my rate had managed to reply in
some fashion to their queries

  and the next instant my belief was confirmed
once more in my brain questions were being
registered questions as intelligible as though i had
heard the words spoken in english i was being
asked about my world questioned as to details
of ray journey as to whether there were more be-
ings like myself and various other matters

  almost before i realized it i was replying and
as i could see by the manner of my strange hosts
my words were heard and understood it is of no
use to describe at length the entire interview that
followed or to repeat it word for word it is enough
for my purpose to state that my story was as un-
believable and as impossible to them as they and
their powers seemed to me i had appeared from
nowhere a strange and to them misshapen being
a creature unlike anything they had ever imagined
and i found myself trying to explain floundering
about trying to make clear matters which to me
were most everyday and ordinary things but to
them were so far beyond their comprehension that
they were utterly incapable of grasping them

  it was like trying to explain trigonometry or
navigation to a small child or to make clear the
principles and operation of some complicated ma-
	amazing stories

chine to a savage and yet this comparison is not
the right one for strange as it may seem the
creatures were quite capable of understanding the
most intricate mechanical devices and scientific
matters although the fact that there were other
intelligent beings- in the world or that for that
matter there was any world except their own coun-
try was utterly beyond them

  of course i did not learn this and did not at-
tempt to converse with them on such matters at
this first interview our talk for regardless of
the fact that they did not speak i must call it a
talk was confined to the most simple matters
but as the weeks months and years passed
and i remained as i still remain among them i
tried to tell them of human life and the world  had
known and of all manner of things which differed
from their own strange ways and existence

  gradually too i became adept at conversing with
them by their uncanny means which i found
later was nothing supernatural magical nor so
very mysterious after all it was accomplished in
fact by vibrating waves sent through the air some-
thing after the manner in which sound waves are
sent and which were produced by one pair of the
creatures antenme and were caught and heard by
another pair

chapter 

it was soon evident to me that even if the
weird creatures could not fully grasp or under-
stand the tale i related still they believed it
or at least considered that it explained my presence
in their land possibly they thought me a harm-
less lunatic or again they may have decided i was
a supernatural being or maybe i was such a curi-
osity or monstrosity in their eyes that i was re-
garded as a valuable specimen at any rate what-
ever the reason they decided that i was not to be
harmed and in fact was to be well treated for my
armed guards were dispersed and i was given to
understand-i would say told but for the fact that
no words were spoken-that the being who had
first found me on the sand was to be my companion
and that he would attend to all my wants my
first and most pressing want was food for i was
once more ravenously hungry and the council oi
court and onlookers having left the chamber though

   mr bishop had of course never heard of radio-tejcphony i am of
the opinion that the beings among whom he found himself had discover-
ed and perfected some form of radio waves by means of which inielli
gihle messages could be transmitted from mind to mind without audible
sounds ip other words the unspoken thoughts could be transmitted on
high frequency waves or on some form of waves akin to electro-map
netic waves as is well known today scientists have reason to believe
that the lower animals possess a somewhat simflar power and can re-
ceive and understand certain waves of which we have no knpwledge-
perhaps the missing waves that in length lie between heat waves and
radio waves it is also believed by many scientists that it is by some
such means that pigeons dogs cats and even toads find their way home
across unknown spaces and for immense distances and that migratory
birds fly unerringly from place to place recent investigations have
also led to the conclusion that insects and crustaceans converse or at
least communicate with one another by means of waves produced by
and received by tbeir antennae if this be so then the highly developed
and specialized crustaceans who inhabit the strange land described by
mr bishop might well have possessed a similar power earned to the th

   cbsuming this were s then there would have been no mystery as to
j-ow they understood him or he them for while spoken words vary
with language the thoughts or brain impressions that words express
must be identical regardless of spoken dialects or racial differences
indeed as will be seen later mr bishops discoveries as he relates
them bear out this logical conclusion it is also highly probable that
all the mechanism of the airships and other contrivances of these
strange beings were actuated by waves similar to our elcctro-magnetic
waves-a e l

lingering and gazing at me most curiously i ex-
pressed my wishes to my strange companion im-
mediately he led me through dark passageways
to a smaller room and there left me for a moment
returning with a bowl-like vessel containing some
liquid and a beautifully devised casket or box filled
with the biscuits such as he had given me upon the
beach

  i devoured three of these and was about to eat
the fourth when the creature who had been watch-
ing me intently called a halt and by the same
strange brain message method warned me that i
must be satisfied and that to partake of more might
lead to grave results i confess i was greatly
tempted to disregard his warning for there seemed
no more sustenance in the stuff than in a dry
cracker but i remembered what a miraculous effect
those i had eaten on the beach had had and re-
luctantly replacing the wafer i drank a deep draught
of the liquid it was as clear and colorless as water
for which i had taken it but as it passed my lips
i almost dropped the bowl in surprise for the
beverage was the most delightful and refreshing
thing i had ever tasted it was neither sweet nor
sour but had a taste absolutely impossible to des-
cribe indeed there are many things in this strange
land which i am at a loss to describe in such a way
that those who have not seen or experienced them
can understand my meaning colors existed which
were quite different from anything i had ever
seen there were sounds totally new to my ears and
tastes that no words can describe

  scarcely had the beverage passed my lips when i
felt rejuvenated no wine or liquor could have
had such a remarkable effect not that it was
heady or exhilarating like liquor for my head re-
mained perfectly clear but i felt years younger i
seemed as strong and fresh as a youth of twenty
and felt ready for anything then a delightful
drowsiness came over me and throwing myself
on the couch i instantly dropped off to a dreamless
slumber

  i was aroused by the being who had me in charge
as he entered the chamber bearing food and drink
as i munched the wafer-like biscuits which were
of a different character from those i had eaten the
previous day i tried my best to communicate with
him or rather i might say to carry on a con-
versation for he very evidently understood all that
i said moreover as on the preceding day i was
able to understand him but the difficulty was that
we had so little in common that it was almost im-
possible to converse at any length however he
made it known that i was free to go and come as i
pleased and that i was considered an honored guest
from some other sphere and i was vastly amused
when he wished to know if i had dropped from the
sky evidently the creatures knew nothing of a
country beyond the mountain barrier and in vain
i endeavored to explain how i had come over the
mountains and to tell of the world on the other side
to him such a thing was incredible as unbelievable
as his land would have been to me before i had seen
it then after much trouble he told me-if i
can use the word told when no sounds issued
from him-that no inhabitant of his country had
ever passed those mountains that beyond was
nothingness and that his country comprised the
beyond the pole



entire world this was most astounding to me for
i had come over the mountains without excessive
difficulty and with their marvelous airships i could
see no reason why they should not have soared above
the peaks but when i questioned the fellow and
later talked with others i learned to my amazement
that the creatures perished miserably if they rose
more than a few hundred feet above the earth
their airships never attained a height of more than
two hundred feet and i was informed that too-
venturesome members of the community who had
attempted to traverse the mountains had gasped
and died long before they reached the summits
to them strange as it may seem an altitude of
five hundred feet was as fatal as a dozen miles in
air to human beings whether this was due to their
physical peculiarities or to some peculiarity in their
atmosphere i have never determined i am of the
opinion however that it is a little of both their
air i am sure is far more rarefied than ours and
thus of course would be unfit to sustain life even
at moderate heights while being evolved from cru-
staceans-as i am positive they are-and with
modified gills instead of lungs they are naturally
less adaptable to changes in the density of air than
are human beings indeed later when i on one
occasion tried to scale the mountains i discovered
that it was with the utmost difficulty that i could
breathe even when half way to the summits

  but this was not the reason why i was forced
to remain in this land even to the present time as
i shall explain later

  but to resume my narrative of my experiences
as soon as i had finished my breakfast i started out
to see the sights it was however some time before
i reached the outer air for i found many most
astounding and interesting things to attract me in
the underground residences of these strange crea-
tures

  the means of lighting the place was a puzzle for
as i have said the illumination was a sort of glow
that appeared to issue from the walls floors and
ceilings as if in fact they were made of translucent
material with lights behind them i examined the
material carefully and found it was formed of one
continuous unbroken surface as if moulded or cast
in place as i found later it was also i discovered
that it was the same material of which the airships
were made indeed later on i found that it was
the sole material these beings possessed for con-
structing anything-that is aside from wood which
was seldom used and was rather a curiosity than
otherwise and a tough grass which they considered
of little value but from which a thin light and ex-
cellent parchment-like material is made-the ma-
terial in fact upon which this manuscript is written
but the amazing part of it is that the metallic-like
substance so widely used can be so altered or modi-
fied that it is adaptable for every purpose

  it can be made opaque transparent r trans-
lucent as hard as steel or as soft and plastic as
putty as brittle as glass or as flexible as rubber
it can be beaten or hammered like gold or copper
it can be moulded by hand or machine and then
hardened or it can be melted and cast moreover
it can be colored or tinted at will it can be woven
like thread and it can be cut bored or worked like
timber by certain processes too it can be made

to emit light indefinitely while the light may yet
be turned off or on at will by means of some electri-
cal or similar power this same mysterious force
serves these creatures in place of steam heat and
all other forms of power

  it was of course a long time before i learned all
this and i was still longer in learning the source
of the remarkable substance then to my utter
amazement i found it was sulphur this statement
may seem incredible for sulphur is so well known
and its properties so well understood that my fel-
low men will no doubt accuse me of telling a palp-
able falsehood but the secret lies in the fact that
these beings have discovered a property of sulphur
of which humans are wholly ignorant this is that
sulphur is really a metal the form knowm to us be-
ing only a salt or oxide and it is the metallic sul-
phur which these weird creatures use for such a
multitude of purposes

  it was as i have said a great surprise to me to
discover this and i could not help thinking what
marvelous accomplishments might be ours if we
possessed the knowledge of obtaining this metal i
had never dreamed that a metallic material could
be obtained from sulphur and at first it seemed un-
believable but as i thought upon the matter i
realized that after all it was no more astonishing
than that aluminum metal could be secured from
the soft rock called bauxite many cargoes of which
had been carried in ships on which i had served
later too j spent much time at the vast deposits of
sulphur which seem to underlie the whole country
although it has been used for countless ages yet
these beings have never had to do any mining for
there are hills and plains composed entirely of the
yellow stuff indeed i was not long in deciding
that the whole place is nothing more than the in-
terior of a huge volcano or a series of volcanic
craters which might partly account for the warmth
of the climate for no doubt there is still volcanic
activity and heat below the surface of the earth
the processes used for refining the sulphur and
transforming it into metal were most interesting
but i am no chemist and the technicalities are far
beyond my powers to describe there are huge
works that cover many square miles and the
workers are i found all of different types forms
and appearances from the other inhabitants in
fact each art profession trade and class of the
beings is i soon found distinct and has been
evolved or developed in such a way as to give the
greatest efficiency and best results along the lines
of endeavor to which each is bound for life i have
mentioned the huge pincer-like claws of the sol-
diers or rather police in the same way diggers
have limbs adapted to their lahors chemists possess
appendages as delicate as the most acurately de-
vised instruments and so on

  but to return to the sulphur and its uses
among other things that interested me greatly

note by dr lyman

            wuunaware that sacral chemists have de-
clared their belief that the element sulphur is derived from a metallic
base although no one has yet produced metallic sulphur yet that docs
not prove the incorrectness of such an hypothesis soda potash anr
many other common chemicals which bear no resemblance to metals
are merely salts or oxides of metals although their metallic bases
were trnieriy unknown modern chemistry however has as is weli
known produced metallic sodium potassium calcium magnesium

was the source of the marvelous power the crea-
tures use this was i found derived from a pe-
culiar blackish and very heavy material which
exists in vast quantities near the sulphur deposits
of itself it is of little value although it is slightly
luminous and will cause sores like burns upon hu-
man skin as i discovered to my sorrow but when
combined with the metallic sulphur or with cer-
tain by-products obtained in the manufacture of
the latter it produces most astonishing results by
varying the combinations and the proportions of
materials it can be made to emit blinding light
which goes on continuously forever without in the
least diminishing or it can be made to explode with
a force greater than dynamite while by still other
methods it may be made to produce invisible power
which can be harnessed as readily as steam and yet
can be transmitted to great distances through the
air like electricity but without the use of wires
about one hundred miles from the chief city is an
immense power house if such it may be called and
from this power o energy is sent broadcast over
the whole country thus by having machines adapt-
ed to the purpose this source of power may be
tapped and used for any purpose such as driving
airships industrial work turning on or off lights
etc but the remarkable part of it to me is the
fact that no machines as we know such things are
used i have visited the plant several times and
yet have never found a single wheel shaft or crank
in it there are merely immense chambers or vats
into which the various substance are run and grid-
like mazes of bars and sheets of metal these are
suspended over the vats and a ceaseless play of
many-colored and strangely tinted lights and in-
tense heat seems to rush upward from the tanks
and to be absorbed by the odd apparatus overhead
irom these it is led into a labyrinth of receptacles
and a mystifying to me network of conduits cables
and huge wires and up-standing rods these scin-
tillate with flashing lights and emit a cracking sound
and send the power in all directions the strang-
est thing about it to my mind is the fact that the
creatures are not injured by this power even when
close to it and while it is passing through their
bodies at first i was deathly afraid of it for it
seemed like terrific discharges of electricity but i
found that even i could stand beside the generators
or whatever they may be called and that with the
colorod flashes all about me and enveloping my body
i felt no ill effects rather it gave me a pleasant
tingling sensation which left me exhilarated for
several days thereafter

  also aside from the metal and the power many
other most valuable things are obtained from the
sulphur and the black rock a vast number of by-
products result and from these all or nearly all

note by dr lyman

    probably the material described by mr bishop is a very rich radio-
 active mineral nkin to or identical with prtclj-blcmie and by combin-
 ing this with derivatives of sulphur the marvelous powers of radium
 were harnessed just how the strange power was produced we can-
 not say for mr bishop was of course ignorant of technicalities as ho
 states i should imagine however that the power was generated by
 breaking down atoms by means of radio activity and thus releasing
 the stupendous forces contained in them this hs long been a dream
 ol scientists for it is well known that a single atom of matter contains
 incalculable power or energy and that if it were possible to break
 or explode atoms undreamed of force would be at nuns disposal
 unquestionably the power described by mr bishop was transmitted by
 means of elcctro-magnetic or similar waves--a  tfe

the wants of the inhabitants are obtained even
the strange beverage i have mentioned was manu-
factured from a by-product as are coloring mater-
ials certain foods and many other things also
as i have said wood is regarded as a curiosity
this is due to the fact that strangely enough there
are practically no real trees in this strange land
by this i do not mean that trees do not exist for
there are great parks or gardens filled with them
but there are no wild trees if i may use the ex-
pression ages ago i understand there were many
but these were all utilized and exhausted and fear-
ing that trees would become extinct they were
preserved in parks as curiosities

  only when they die is the wood available and the
creatures prize this highly and treasure it as though
it were a most precious substance using it as we
might use gold or silver most of the country is
covered with a coarse sedgy grass but there are
many forms of shrubs and plants and immense
areas of bare land which at first puzzled me

  i had seen no cultivated plants or gardens-ex-
cept park-like places like botanical gardens-and i
imagined that the bare areas were fields being pre-
pared for cultivation as i saw many of the beings
working in them imagine my wonder when i
found that these bare patches of earth provided the
inhabitants with their food countless years ago
i was informed the beings had abandoned raising
food plants the plants so they discovered merely
drew sustenance from the air and soil and trans-
formed this to food fit to eat and the creatures
reasoning that this process of nature was a round-
about method of making food devised means of
obtaining their provisions from the air and earth
direct doing away with the plants entirely

  from the edible materials thus obtained they
make the wafer-like biscuit i have referred to and
these with their liquors and little pellets form
their entire diet each class or variety of wafer
i learned contained different food values of a vege-
table nature while the pellets supplies the animal
mattei and by choosing these any taste or need
could be satisfied also just as they secure pro-
visions of a vegetable nature from the soil itself
without the time and trouble involved in raising
crops so they manufacture the foods of an animal
nature from the vegetable products animals they
say merely transform the herbage they devour in
to meat and such things so why raise living crea-
tures with great trouble and care and then slaughter
them when the same materials or at least material
containing the same nourishment and the same
chemicals can be made direct

  and a word in regard to the animal life of this
strange country may be of interest to any humans
who find this document at certain seasons vast
numbers of birds visit the great lakes or seas which
are all of fresh watex and i have found a great deal
of pleasure in watching these for the albatrosses
mollymokes gulls and other familiar birds come over
the mountains from the world i once knew and
seem to me a bit like visitors and old friends from
my home it was in fact these periodical visits
of the sea fowl that gave me the idea of sending out
my manuscript in the hope that some man might
find it but to return to the animals that dwell
here there are a number of the giant rat-lik
beyond the pole



creatures as large as kids such as the one i killed
and devoured when i first gained the base of the
mountains and there are many small birds but
aside from these no living creatures exist in a wild
state in zoos or museums are many most wonder-
ful creatures some of which bear a resemblance to
those on the other side of the world but most of
which are wholly different and many of which are
so astoundingly weird gigantic or grotesque as to
be horrifying or to make me think i am dreaming
or delirious when i look at them

   some of these are gigantic reptiles with immense
scaly bodies and with heads covered with great bony
plates and armed with huge horns they are
ferocious looking creatures nearly fifty feet in
length but quite docile and harmless and very
stupid others resemble giant seals but instead of
being covered with fur their bodies are smooth and
slimy like eels there are also creatures with
enormously long snake-like necks and great round
bodies these are water animals and should they
be seen at sea they would be veritable sea-serpents
there are several great beasts too which appear
to be some sort of elephants though vastly bigger
than any i have ever seen and there are a few
rhinoceros-like animals besides numbers of smaller
things such as deer goats beasts somewhat like
ponies and giant turtles of carnivorous beasts
there are none and i find nothing that at all re-
sembles an ox or sheep all these i understand once
roamed the country wild but were destroyed by the
strange inhabitants until only those in captivity
remained but perhaps the weirdest of all these
creatures in the parks or zoos are the insects there
are butterflies whose wings spread a yard across
flies as big as turkeys caterpillars with a girth
greater than my body and immense spiders with
six-foot hairy legs and immense staring fiery red
eyes these always give me a feeling of dread and
nausea as i look at them and many a time i have
awakened screaming from a nightmare wherein i
thought myself being attacked by one of these hor-
rible creatures the natives however seem to have
no fear of them and i have often seen the younger
ones or if i may so call them the children feeding
the monstrous spiders through the bars of their
cages these bars by the way are made of the trans-
parent form of the sulphur metal and looking at the
creatures the bars are all but invisible-as are the
cages-so that one seems to see a horrible beast un-
confined and ready to spring at one but of all the in-

sects those which interest me most are the giant-
ants these are as large as good-sized dogs and are
kept in a vast pit-like enclosure here they hurry
about and labor ceaselessly building huge mounds
and digging tunnels only to tear them down and
start over again they are the most ferocious of
all the animals also and if one of their number
is injured or sick the others after carefully ex-
amining him tear him to bits and devour his still
moving body on one occasion a great lizard-like
beast died and his carcass was thrown into the ant
pit and i fairly shook with terror as i watched the
creatures gnawing him to bits and with incredible
strength dragging the immense body here and there
often too the ants seem to be drilling and they
seem to possess intelligences almost human often
i think what terrible havoc they would play should
they escape from their den but i am assured that
this is impossible as the frail looking fence that
borders the pit is made of a material that is certain
death to any ant that touches it indeed i heard if
i may use that term the story of these ants it
seems that ages ago-these beings have no means of
recording time by the way-the ants roamed at
large and destroyed the inabitants everywhere a
constant war was waged between the two races and
bloody battles were fought in a way it was much
like the indian warfare at home though far more
merciless and cruel for each side made slaves of
their captives and gave no quarter

  then the crustacean-like beings made a discovery
they found vast numbers of dead ants where an
invading army had moved across a great pile of
waste material from the sulphur works and by test-
ing this on captive ants they found that it was
instant death to the creatures this enabled them
to exterminate their hereditary enemies for the
material was made in stupendous quantities and
placed in a great wall or pile about the advancing
host of the inhabitants thus guarded the ants
were powerless to harm them and gradually all but
a few of the ants were utterly destroyed these
few survivors were made prisoners and confined
and it is the descendants of these that are in the pit
today

  since then so i understand there have been no
wars or battles in the entire land and the soldiers
or police are being done away with as there is
really no need for them no more soldiers are bred
and in a few years none of the old ones will remain
alive

rhe hero of the story edmund stonewall
has discovered how to utilize atomic ener-
gy he constructs a car that cm traverse
interplanetary space actuated by this energy and
with two friends starts on a trip to the planet
venus not disclosing to them his intention at first
he reaches a rather desolate part of the planet
where daylight never appears sees the almost ape-
like inhabitants cave dwellers who wish to sacri-
fice one of them to the gods and they rescue the
proposed victim only by killing the high priest
they get in among the valleys in a mountain of
ice on the edge of the dark face of the planet tak-
ing with them some of the cave dwellers on sleds
the car with sleds fastened alongside and all but
one of the cave-dwellers upon them is carried now
aiong a sort of glacial stream but soon sleds and
the unfortunate occupants disappear and our trav-
ellers are left with only one of the ape-like cave
dwellers juba as company- now they reach the

warm regions of venus where there is perpetual
day and there find a highly developed race who
communicate with each other by a species of tele-
pathy and our travelers are enchanted by the beau-
tiful appearance of the beings who are superior in
every way to terrestrial mankind

  as they fly a terrible catastrophe is narrowly
averted edmund shooting the steersman on a threat-
ening aeroplane a beautifvl woman ala the
heroine of the story saves them from the wrath of
the mob by her influence she and edmund fall in
love with each other edmund has a rival ingra
in his claims on ala and the plotting and deeds of
ingra are directed to getting rid of the earthly
visitors they explore the country are threatened
by a huge monster and at last get into a true eden

    conclusion

an escape

our assailants retreated into the bushes as we
threatened them with the pistols but edmund
would not allow ingra to escape with the others
the fellow was completely cowed knowing the dead-
ly power of our pistols and he obeyed edmunds com-
mands with a dejected air occasionally glancing
at ala who disdained to return his look

  edmund backed him into the open door of the car
and we all entered after hunting up the maid who
half scared to death had concealed herself in the
bushes then edmund
closed the door and turned
to the machinery leaving
to us the care of guarding
our prisoner

  the latter sat quietly
enough on a bench jack
on one side of him and i
on the other while ala
placed herself as far from
him as she could get

  i wondered at the fel-
lows audacity surely no
man in his senses would

have thought of winning a womans heart by
violence but evidently his passionate nature had
overcome all scruples of reason and as for con-
science he had none

  alas detestation of him was written on her every
feature

  after we had got out of the wild tangle of
branches vines and flowers the car rose to a con-
siderable elevation and edmund circled about to get
his bearings then ala went to his side

  conversing together they looked out of the win-
dows and she indicated the direction that we were

 v the concluding chapters of this charming interplane-
 tarian tale we find our heroes beset by many new and
 extraordinary dangers there is hardly a page of the
 concluding chapters in which excitement does not run
 high we are not going to tell you the end of the story
 because we do not wish to spoil it for you

    as in the previous installments professor garrett p
 serviss has given an accurate scientific analysis of what
 may be found on venus should the planet ever be
 expored

to pursue first we darted high in the air and then
set off at a great rate it now became evident at
what a vast distance from the capital and from the
inhabited lands of venu we had landed in our
wild descent from the cloud-dome

   but for alas topographical knowledge we shoulc
 have been long in finding the proper route

ingra a prisoner

the way once pointed out however we never
swerved aside and edmund worked up the
speed to as high a point
miimmgiuksmmmittmmm as he deemed safe in that
dense atmosphere which
seemed to flow in trans-
lucent waves about the
sides of the rushing car
at last i asked edmund
what he intended to do
with the prisoner

  til put him behind
bars he replied grimly
	if i have to construct

them myself
notwithstanding our
great speed the journey was a long one we kept
at an elevation of several miles in order to com-
mand a wide view and the scene was magnificent
the wilderness we were leaving behind was in a
tropical zone on the borders of that savage region
where we had encountered the saurian monster and
a vast roll of strangely glowing clouds lay upon
the far horizon

   but beneath us the country continually improved
 in aspect signs of cultivation making their appear-
 ance until at length we began to pass over villages
 and then over small cities each of which in imita-




amazing stories

tion of the metropolis had its little group of aerial
towers with fluttering banners occasionally we
saw a few airships at a distance traveling in vari-
ous directions and these became more numerous as
we approached the capital

  our approach was not unobserved and a crowd of
planes and airships came to meet and escort us as
we drew near our reception at the principal land-
ing of the great tower was most joyous

back to the city

the aerial part of the city seemed suddenly to
swarm with inhabitants and the air was filled
with excited excursionists rushing together from
all sides

  on approaching the landing-stage i saw a throng
of brilliantly dressed people and officials awaiting us
with welcoming smiles and gestures and among
them to my great pleasure i noticed juba standing
in the foremost rank treated with evident respect
and showing every sign of joy on his broad hairy
face we had been absent not more than twenty-
four hours but we were greeted as warmly as if our
stay had been a year

  no sooner was the car well over the landing than
edmund brought it to rest upon the broad plat-
form and threw open the door jack and henry
were the first to alight the maid followed them
and i came next

  edmund lingered a moment to secure something
in the mechanism and ala stayed near him while
ingra was behind them

  during the trip i had not liked ingras conduct
though i confess i do not know exactly how he
could have pleased me in his bearing but at any
rate i felt an indefinite sense of anxiety whenever i
glanced at him he remained all the while in moody
silence occasionally looking at ala in a way i did not
fancy but most of the time fixing his eyes covertly
upon edmund whose every movement he watched
as he manipulated the controllers

  somehow he impressed me with the idea that he
was planning a stroke against us and when i step-
ped from the car my anxiety suddenly flashed into a
vivid apprehension of evil and i could not resist
turning back and saying to edmund

look out for ingra edmund he means no good

  dont worry ill take care of him edmund re-
plied glancing with a smile over his shoulder as he
tightened a little hand-wheel

  a moment later edmund approached the door
beckoned to ala to follow i saw now that he in-
tended to leave ingra in the car until he could ex-
plain the situation and provide for his incarcera-
tion

  what followed was like a lightning-stroke

the car is lost

i saw edmund pitch forward propelled from the
car-door as if he had been shot out and an in-
stant afterward the door was slammed to and i
heard the bars fall into place

  edmund recovered himself in a moment and to-
gether we sprang at the closed door and threw our-
selves against it of course we made no impression
edmunds face was as pale as a sheet

quick-for heavens sake he cried get

something get me a bar i must break it some-
how this is awful ala-inside can nobody get
me a bar of steel

   the crowd pressed round us without comprehend-
 ing what was going on nobody except ourselves
 knew that ingra was in the car edmund ran to one
 of the windows but even as he reached it the steel
 shutter was closed with a bang from within and we
 heard the bolts shoot into their sockets

   it was the only time in my acquaintance with him
 that i ever saw edmund stonewall for an instant
 jlose his wits he seemed not to know what to do

   his face was dreadful to look upon he pounded
with his fists upon the steel walls of the car until
his knuckles reddened

   as for the rest of us we knew no more than he
what to do the excitement spread to the crowd
and they pressed upon us with wondering looks and
exclamations

   a minute or two passed in this helpless agitation
 and then the car gave a lurch and a second later it
 rose from the platform

   edmund cried out in helpless passionate fear

   in a moment the car was a yard above the plat-
form and gathering speed i felt my heart sink
edmund became if possible paler than before

   hold it hold it he shouted and with him i
tried to grasp the smooth polished walls that slipped
away from our hands

   at this moment there was a rush in the crowd-
people were flung aside and to my amazement as
the car rose in the air i saw juba make a mighty
leap seize the steel grating covering one of the
windows and soar away with the machine like a
huge baboon hanging on the outside of a cage

   then the car shot toward the sky

            chapter xvii
            to the rescue

alow exclamation magnified by the mult-
itude of strange voices into a mighty mur-
mur rose from the crowd and every eye
followed the retreating car

   in this emergency all of edmunds sagacity and
self-command instantly came back he wa once
more the cool resourceful master of the situation

   an aeroplane he shouted and at the word
sprang toward one of the floating machines beside
the landing

   brushing aside the engineer in a moment he had
 the machine in control jack and i were upon his
 heels but henry was not quick enough and was
 left behind there were only four or five men the
 crew of the plane on the craft

   with a skill and rapidity that astonished me
well as i knew his capacity edmund swung the
huge machine round and with reckless disregard
of consequences set the driving-screws whirring at
their highest speed the great tower seemed to
melt away behind us so quickly did we leave it

   but it was a mad chase

                  a race begins

what could this air-driven craft do against the
car impelled by the mysterious interatomic
force already the latter was rapidly diminishing
a columbus of space



 with distance still we could see juba clinging to
 the window-grating although at every instant i
 expected him to fall

  but edmund would not despair his eyes shone
as he drove the machinery of the plane to its ut-
most limit the crew were stupefied and offered no
opposition

   we must not lose sight of them said edmund
his self-control becoming more perfect as the
minutes passed we must never lose sight of them
for an instant

  but surely i exclaimed you cannot hope to
overtake them

  yes he said almost fiercely i hope even that
remember he added more coolly that ingra
really knows nothing of the management of the con-
trollers he has watched me operate them long
enough to know how to start the car unless heaven
is against us he will not be able to work it up to its
best speed and he can hardly direct it with cer-
tainty at any moment he may find himself des-
cending heaven grant that they do not come
down with a rush

  but there is ala i said she knows how to
manage the machinery perhaps he will be com-
pelled to entrust it to her

  edmund ground his teeth in rage at my words
  yes ala is there a prisoner 

  and juba i added

  but how long can he remain on that fearful
perch and what can he do

  if they are aware of his presence i suggested
perhaps ala may find a way to communicate with
him and aid him in his efforts

  the idea seemed to strike edmund and he joy-
fully replied

  yes yes surely she will find a way she is a
great woman-a woman to trust in an emergency
what a brave act that was of jubas i who could
have dreamed that under his shaggy exterior there
was a heart of gold and so quick a brain

  he was the head blacksmith in the cavern said
jack if there is any way to get into that car he
will find it

  it can only be done by aid from within replied
edmund but i trust to ala she will find a
way

  they cannot but be aware that juba is on the
car i said they must surely hear him and his
mere presence will have its effect

  if ingra does not contrive to throw him off
suggested jack

  he cannot get at him was edmunds reply
if only he doesnt lose his breath with the swift
motion and if his strength holds out all may be
well but we must keep them in sight it is our
only chance and theirs

  the car was now so far away that it looked very
small but being thrown in silhouette against the
softly glowing cloud-dome-for it was at a greater
elevation than ours-we could still with the aid of
a glass clearly see juba clinging to the outside

  it was a comfort to know that he was yet able to
retain his perch if ho could stay there to the end
he might be of estimable service when the crisis
should arrive

the question of elevation

at first i was somewhat surprised that edmund
kept at so low an elevation compared with that
of the fleeing car we were not more than a half-
mile above the ground while the object of our pur-
suit was at least three miles high but in a little
while it became obvious that the course which ed-
mund had adopted was a very wise one in the
first place by keeping at a low elevation we could
always see the car projected against the bright sky
and there was thus less danger of its escaping us

  in the next place as edmund pointed out when
the car came down as it must do some time we
could cut in under it so to speak and approach the
landing-point along a base-line shorter than the
diagonal that the car would have to pursue

  the higher he goes said edmund the greater
our advantage will be fortunately he seems to be
rising all the time there is no danger that he will
run away in that direction

  he has no conception of anything above the
cloud-dome and his only object is to get as far
away as possible in order to defy pursuit before
landing i expect every moment now to see him
begin to descend

  but are you sure that he can manipulate the
controllers well enough to make a safe descent i
asked

  let us pray that he can replied edmund i
will give him credit for great intelligence if ho
did not possess extraordinary capacity he would
never have learned simply by watching me how to
run the machinery

  the fact that he could penetrate so far gives
me hope that he has learned enough to insure their
safety the highspeed controllers used when
astride the atmosphere are in a different location
from the others and are manipulated somewhat dif-
ferently

  i did not touch them during our journey so that
i have little fear that he will discover their use it
is now evident that we can at least keep the car
in sight

  the resistance of this dense atmosphere is a
serious obstacle to a machine which unlike the
plane does not derive an advantage from that very
circumstance

an alarm

we were now many miles from the capital and
traveling toward the tropical belt it was evi-
dent that ingra intended to take refuge again in the
wilderness though at a point far distant from the
place where we had so recently encountered him

  ala has told me said edmund that ingra
who is very fond of wild sports and who until our
arrival seems to have exhibited no evil characteris-
tics has a number of hunting-lodges in this vast
wilderness and it was due to the unlucky fate that
guided us in our descent that we fell into his hands

  for unknowingly we came down within a half-
mile of one of his lodges he always has a retinue
in attendance at his lodges and probably he is now
making for one of these places

  do you think they are aware that we are follow-
ing

of course they will expect to be pursued but


amazing stories

i am in hopes that ingra has not seen us and does
not know that we have kept within eyesight you
remember that the car has no window in the rear-
a mistake of construction which until now i have re-
gretted it has not swerved from its course since
starting and i have been careful to keep directly
behind it

  consequently there is every reason to think
that ingra trusting to the speed of the car has not
even taken the trouble to look behind besides we
have kept comparatively close to the ground where
it is not easy to see us from a distance and the
moment i perceive the car beginning to descend i
shall run down to the very tree-tops in order to be
the better concealed

  our hopes now rose high we had demonstrated
an ability to keep the car in view though to be sure
it had become little more than a dark speck in the
sky and its steady motion relieved our anxiety con-
cerning a possible disaster from ingras inability
to manage it

  several hours passed and once more we had left
the inhabited lands behind and were passing over
the border of the wilderness where the luxuriance
of the vegetation surpassed that of the amazonian
forests of the wilds of borneo

  suddenly edmund uttered an exclamation

  great heavens he cried look something
is wrong it is all to end in disaster at last

fear of losing the car

jack and i startled by edmunds agitation
glanced at the distant car it was falling from

the sky

  it shot hither and thither sweeping in long de-
scending curves and darting to one side and a-
nother like a collapsed balloon

  what can have happened i exclaimed good
heavens if juba should be flung off now our only
ally would be lost

  no we have another said edmund quietly all
his self-mastery asserting itself-ala herself

  look he continued a moment afterward the
car rights itself it will come down all right

  it was so the eccentric movements ceased and
we saw the car descending rapidly but with a
steady motion which indicated that it was again un-
der control during the ten minutes that the wild
tumble lasted it had fallen within half a mile of
the ground and now it was gliding swiftly away
from us over the top of the great forest

  edmund strove to increase our speed making the
bilent engineer and his men aid him with their ut-
most exertions glancing behind i now noticed for
the first time that several airplanes were pursuing
us but they were far behind

  they had probably started in pursuit as soon
as possible after our chase began but we had been
so absorbed in watching the car that we had not
even thought of looking behind we had trusted
entirely to ourselves but now i felt a satisfaction
in knowing that we should have assistance in an
emergency

  i called edmunds attention to our pursuers but
he gave no heed his whole mind and soul were
fixed upon the car in a little while it had de-
scended so low that it became necessary for us to
rise in order to keep it in view

  nevertheless as edmund had foreseen our course
lying so near the ground had given us a certain
advantage and we had drawn preceptibly nearer
while running for the point toward which the car
was descending still it now became very difficult
to keep the object of our pursuit in view

  at times we lost sight of it entirely against the
dark background of foliage but an occasional
gleam from the polished sides of the car enabled
us to retain a general notion of its location

a battle

at last it dropped into the great sea of vegeta-
tion and was completely lost at this time
we were apparently about three miles behind it
keep your eyes fixed on the point where it dis-
appeared said edmund dont let your sight
waver i shall make straight for the place

  fortune favored us for at the spot where the car
had sunk from sight a group of enormous trees
lifted their mighty tops high above the general sur-
face of the forest and this landmark was invaluable
to us

  when we had run within an eighth of a mile
of these trees edmund at last slowed up and got
the airplane under perfect control

  we crept silently above the tree-tops every eye
fixed upon the spot where we expected at any mo-
ment to see the car

  suddenly a forest glade appeared shadowed
by the very trees that had served as our guides
and there was the car resting upon the ground
the door was toward us and open

  in it stood ala looking with a horrified coun-
tenance upon a spectacle that might well have
frozen her blood

  ingra and juba were engaged in a terrific bat-
tle at one moment they rolled upon the ground
locked together looking like a man and a wild
beast at death-grips

  each was fiercely exerting his utmost strength
now one now the other was on top

  each endeavoring to throttle the other they
revolved so rapidly that the eye could hardly
follow the successive phases of the struggle

  suddenly they rolled against a rock and the
shock releasing their hold both leaped to their
feet but neither flinched nor gave back

  they sprang together again with demoniac
fury jubas huge eyes blazing out of the wild
tangle of his hair while his huge shaggy arms
resembled those of a bear rushing madly to the
death-hug

  but ingra was a foe worthy to encounter so
formidable an antagonist with amazing
strength and agility he hurled his assailant back-
ward and then to my horror i saw that he had
his long knife in his hand while juba had no
weapon

juba a fighter

lowering his form as he sped to the onset
and with a wicked lunge ingra darted up-
on his foe for an instant i thought that the
blade had reached the vitals of his antagonist
for juba staggered backward but a second later
ingra shot away as if the walking-beam of an en-
a columbus of space



gine had struck him and fell stunned and mo-
tionless

  jubas mighty foot had been propelled against
his chest for like a frenchman the creature
fought with arms and legs alike

  now you have him shouted jack dancing
with excitement as edmund swept the airplane
toward the spot pin him down dont let him
up

  juba sprang at his foe but the latter had been
driven so far away by the terrible blow that be-
fore juba could seize him he had recovered and
was on his feet again

  dont let him get away cried edmund leap-
ing from the airplane as it touched the ground and
rushing with jack and me on his heels to the scene
of the encounter

  but ingra was too quick

  seeing his enemies swarming he turned and
ran with the speed of a deer

  in a second he had disappeared in the under-
growth

chapter xviii

we find another enemy

after struggling and stumbling through
the thicket for a few minutes we gave up
the chase sooner than we should have done
on account of edmunds anxiety to return to ala
who had remained where we first saw her stand-
ing in the door of the car

  when he stopped we all stopped though juba
whose blood was up would have continued the
pursuit if he had not been compelled to desist
he disregarded the rest of us but obeyed ed-
munds call like a faithful hound

  it was a great disappointment that ingra had
escaped but there was no help for it we must
face the consequences and probably there was not
one of us who did not feel an unuttered forebod-
ing of disaster we had made for ourselves a
terrible enemy and it was perfectly certain that
as long as we remained he would pursue us with
all the energy of his fiercely passionate nature
and the resources of his acute mind

  edmund expressed this when he exclaimed on
our hurried return to the car

  that fellow and i cannot both live in this
world he will not let me alone but i will never
run from him

  then why dont you get out of his world
said jack who sometimes expressed rather bluntly
his suddenly conceived notion of right and jus-
tice you are the interloper not he

  am i an interloper replied edmund with
flashing eye and flushed cheek when she-
pointing to ala who having heard of our ap-
proach came joyously to meet us-calls upon
me to defend her

  jack made no reply but whispered in my ear
jove i dont blame him id die fighting for
her myself

ala once more

alas beauty seemed tenfold greater in the
flush of excitement that overspread her features
she greeted us with hardly less warmth than she

bestowed upon edmund and the caressing touch
of her hand on jubas hairy arm was a reward
that the poor fellow plainly accepted in full com-
pensation for the fearful risk he had run and
he deserved her thanks because but for his pres-
ence ingra would have abducted ala as soon as
the car landed and we should have arrived too
late

  we had hardly reached the car again when one
of the pursuing planes came up and close after
it followed several more they brought a num-
ber of court officials and attendants who were
quite in the dark as to the meaning of this ex-
traordinary escapade for it will be remem-
bered there had been no time to tell anybody of
the presence of ingra in the car when we arrived
at the tower

  ala explained the situation and the excitement
of her friends was laughable they ran about in
the underbrush anxious to show their devotion
and possibly thinking that they would find the
fugitive concealed close at hand

  but ala recalled them and as more planes
arrived organized the search with a rapidity that
increased my respect for her ability there was
one remarkable feature in her intercourse with
her people that struck me with great force

  she was a queen and she had the look and bear-
ing of one when she chose to assert her author-
ity but there was no appearance of servility in
the manner of those surrounding her and she de-
manded none if ever there was a democratic
queen it was she everybody recognized her
rank but it was rather with evidences of admira-
tion and love than of mere submission

  in a few minutes she had arranged her plan
airplanes were sent scouting over the forest in all
directions with orders to search every nook where
ingra might be in hiding then she turned to
edmund and they communed together for a time
while we awaited the result of their consultation

  the decision apparently somewhat against ed-
munds opinion for he wished to aid in the
search was to return at once to the capital ac-
cordingly we embarked in the car and were soon
speeding away from the wilderness leaving a
dozen of the planes to prosecute the search

  after our return to the capital a very different
series of events began to occupy our attention

  of ingra we heard no more for the present
one by one the air planes that had been left to hunt
him down returned unsuccessful

  it was certain that he had adherents in the
city as he had elsewhere for his family was very
old and powerful and had always occupied an ex-
alted position but still we saw nothing to alarm
us nevertheless we never doubted that he was
simply biding his time and planning his ven-
geance

  to me the thought became an obsession and
sometimes i could hardly sleep on account of it
it was horrible to think of our being practically
alone here in this distant world among a peo-
ple who knew nothing of our ways and who
treated us with respect only because in the first
place we excited their curiosity and in the second
place because alas favor was our shield


amazing stories

  but i could not get away from the fear that
when the novelty should be over the romantic
attachment which their queen had formed for
edmund would cease to captivate the publics
fancy and then the scale would incline against
us whenever i broached the subject to edmund
however he pretended to treat my fears as purely
imaginary

jacks tale of his troubles

jack always impressionable and erratic quickly
lost himself in the delights of life in the brilliant
capital and could not be brought to think of the
future to henry i dared not open my mind for
he was already only too much disposed to brood
and to take the dark view of everything if he had
known my doubts he would have driven me mad by
magnifying them

  for a while he tormented us witltcomplatnts and
begged to be taken back to the earth until edmund
turned upon him in such a fury that he never
again ventured to open his lips on the subject

  in the meantime it was delightful to watch the
gracious manner in which ala sought to distract
us

  she began by exhibiting the marvels of the capital
thus far we had only seen the great throne-room
the hall of justice and one or two smaller apart-
ments in the palace

  now she conducted us through halls and rooms
more splendid than i could have imagined to exist
the golden decorations were beyond belief in their
richness in the astonishing quantity of the precious
metal lavished upon them and in the delicacy and
beauty of the forms

  nothing interested henry so much as this it
stirred his cupidity which i must confess although
i liked him was a prominent defect of his character

what a place for a pizarro he exclaimed

  yes said edmund but there is no cringing
atahualpa here you need not dream of carrying
off any of this wealth

  but you seem to be in a fair way of falling heir
to it put in jack with a laugh

  edmund colored but did not reply

  for shame jack i said cant you remember
that if ala does not understand our language she
has a marvelous power of reading our thoughts

  thats so said jack uponmy word i feel
rather uncomfortable in this world where a mans
mind goes naked

  why a little while ago i was strongly tempted
to steal a kiss from a pretty maid who was showing
me a wonderful affair of gold and jewels i dont
know whether it was an idol or what and upon
my word before i could have made a motion-and
of course i didnt really mean to-she darted away
from me as if she had been stung and her winning
smiles were changed for a black look that made me
hang my head

  after this we all became a little more circum-
spect in our comments and tried to keep our
thoughts to ourselves unless as was generally the
case they were such as our entertainers could only
find pleasure in knowing

a wonderful city

i should have to write a book to tell you about all
the surprising things that ala showed us in
the palace and in the city-for we made a tour of
that also

  the streets were wonderful crooked as cow-paths
crowded with people magnificent with shops filled
with all sorts of curious objects and bordered with
thousands of aerial structures that towered up and
up glittering like a jack frost paradise at christ-
mas  while at all elevations air ships and airplanes
passed and repassed steering clear of one another
with the grace and ease of venetian gondolas

  she took us through a great library where we
saw the printed books to which i have referred
but there was nothing to compare in strangeness
with the visit which we finally made to a kind of
temple where we saw the most remarkable char-
acter in venus the head medicine man as jack
facetiously dubbed him

  but we couldnt remain long in a facetious mood
when in the presence of this personage and be-
sides he gave us a shock the full nature of which
i did not comprehend until long afterward when it
came upon me with overwhelming force

  jacks title for him may have been sufficiently
descriptive of his functions he seemed to be a
kind of masculine pythoness and his gloomy
cavernous apartment in the center of the temple
strangely lighted with huge dull-red electric globes
was apparently a delphic shrine for the people of
venus

the high priest

it was our first introduction to any thing resem-
bling superstition among these people and to me
at least it came as a great surprise for in this
world of light beauty and harmony such a thing
seemed strikingly out of place the evident awe
with which ala regarded this high priest of
mystery displeased me also

  contrary to what one might expect this man who
was of extraordinary stature i should say nearly
seven feet tall showed no signs of age he seemed
to be in middle life and very vigorous and as he sat
on a kind of throne of some black highly polished
metal with his elbow resting on a short pillar cap-
ped with a circlet of red jewels that blazed like
living coals his huge head and strong face were
marvelously impressive

  i never saw such a face anywhere else it was
beardless and as white as marble usually he al-
lowed only his profile to be seen and one could not
look upon it without a creeping of the nerves his
nose was immense resembling a great curved beak
and his deep-sunk eyes roofed with projecting
brows were as black as jet but curiously luminous
as they gleamed sidewise out of their pent-house

  but when he turned his full face even edmund
started back he seemed to project his countenance
toward us like a monstrous bird stretching out its
neck and his glowing eyes appeared to penetrate
our inmost thoughts

this lasted only for a moment and then he
turned his profile again and remained motionless

  ala then had a long communication with edmund
at the end of which he turned to us and said
a columbus of space



  this is the most remarkable thing that we have
yet encountered it seems that this is the center
of their religious system and that strange man is
its head it is as far as i can make out based upon
a kind of sun-worship

the sun and venus

at rare intervals the cloud-dome opens over-
head in a narrow rift through which the sun
appears for a few moments as a vast blinding ball
of fire larger and brighter of course than we ever
see it from the earth sometimes a whole genera-
tion passes without this momentary opening of the
heavens

  ala herself has never seen the vision of the
bright god of the sky but like all her people she
regards it as a manifestation of a higher govern-
ing power and every time that the phenomenon oc-
curs there is an extraordinary outburst of enthu-
siasm which arrests all other affairs and the whole
planet is swept by a wave of religious frenzy

  this high priest is regarded as the mortal repre-
sentative of the power above upon his death an-
other chosen by what i suppose may be called a
council of augurs takes his place he has all the
sacredness and influence of a delphic oracle and
his utterances are considered as sure prophecies
of future events

  id never come to him for a fortune broke in
jack i dont like his looks

  hush but thats just what you have come for
replied edmund with a smile and i dont know
how the thing is going to work out for us ai
has brought us here to learn this priests opinion
about-well about me you will understand if
he proves unpropitious it wont be well i hope for
a favorable oracle

  this put an entirely new complexion upon the af-
fair and i began to regard the occupant of the
black throne with an apprehension that i had not
felt before i could have wished our fate to lie
in anybodys hands but his i quite agreed with
jack on that point

  i wondered why ala had not consulted this
authority earlier if she did not feel free to make
her own choice and act her own will now that we
through edmund were so deeply involved the con-
sequences could not but be very serious if another
adverse influence besides that of ingra was directed
against us

  but i suppose the girl queen had simply followed
the dictates of her heart at first and then events had
so crowded upon one another that there was no op-
portunity to take counsel

  we were not compelled to wait long to discover
the trend of the oracle the beaked face and the
jetty eyes were turnd upon us again and without
warning the gigantic form rose to its full height
one arm was thrown out toward us in a gesture of
repulsion while the eyes blazed from the out-thrust
colorless countenance so fiercely that in spite of all
my efforts at self-command i absolutely quailed
before them

  henry started back and would have fled incon-
tinently if edmund had not seized his arm and de-
tained him juba alone to my surprise remained
totally unmoved either he did not understand or

else he had unwavering confidence in us and so
feared nothing

ala defiant

ala for a moment was overwhelmed with seem-
ing disappointment and sorrow then she
slowly raised her head her cheeks reddened her
eyes shone with a determined look and meeting
the glance of the great priest unflinchingly she laid
her hand on edmunds shoulder i saw a mingled
look of pride love and defiance pass over edmunds
features and then he faced the new enemy he had
found with a firm glance

  now we are in for it whispered jack if ed-
mund pulls us out of this ill swear by him for-
ever

  but the immediate consequences were not so
serious-at least in appearance-as our fears had
anticipated

  the priest from his towering elevation glanced
scornfully at ala and then in a low monotonous
tone began a kind of chant only ala of course
understood him but as she listened an expression
of growing horror came over her face the scene
lasted only two or three minutes when the chant
was finished the oracular speaker slowly sank back
upon his throne and turned away his face which
had become once more as impassive as marble

  ala could hardly remain upright she leaned
on edmunds arm and as i thought sobbed

  suddenly she straightened the queenly look
and manner returned her whole bearing and ex-
pression denoted resistance and resolution turn-
ing her back upon the black throne without another
glance at its occupant but with a look at edmund
-in which her inmost soul shone forth in a way
that there was no mistaking-she led us from the
chamber

the priests prophecy

when we were alone afterward in an apart-
ment in the palace edmund told us the
meaning of what had occurred

  that the decision was adverse he said i need
not tell you we have got the religious head of the
planet against us now but his closing speech
which ala has explained to me as best she can was
a queer medley--a sort of prophetic vision it would
seem-which greatly affects ala though for my part
i only laugh at it

  but what was it urged jack

  oh said edmund only a crazy mother shiptofl
jumble of nonsense he talked about a grand con-
flagration and a general wiping out of things and
persons that he doesnt like i snap my fingers at
his divination but without any mumble magic he
can do us a lot of harm if i could persuade ala
to go id quit venus within twenty-four hours
but i dont believe shed consent to go and i wont
leave her so that the end of it

  henry groaned in spirit but jack showed no
white feather and i dont believe i did either

  bully for you edmund  jack cried go in and
win well stand by you if we never see old new
york again

  edmund smiled with gratification and grasped
us each warmly by the hand

chapter xix

an extraordinary hunt

the significance of what had occurred in the
temple gradually dawned upon me after-
ward but it was never so clear in my mind
as to produce more than an uneasy and growing
foreboding

  edmund did not mention the subject again and
there was no outward manifestion of the new op-
position which had been set up against us natural-
ly it would require time to develop its force it
was a struggle between two opponents of equal
power for if the big medicine man as jack con-
tinued to call him was supreme in religious affairs
ala was nevertheless queen and her popularity was
a bulwark to her authority

  besides so far as we knew the affair was a secret
known only to the persons immediately concerned
there had been no witnesses of the scene before the
black throne

  in the meantime ala showed as little anxiety as
edmund she was almost continually with us and
the time glided away very pleasantly with the enter-
tainments which she was constantly providing for
our amusement

color music

our attention was now once more turned to the
mystery of the color music it was perfectly
clear after what we had learned in the wildness
that the play of colors which had so astonished us
furnished but a part of the esthetic enjoyment of
these people

  frequently there were what i may call concerts
in the palace and on these occasions i became con-
vinced that more than half of the effect produced by
the dramatic harmonies that gushed in glowing
waves of color from the great circles on the walls
was due to the production of sounds inaudible to
us

  edmund as i had anticipated that he would do
from his remark in reply to jacks enthusiastic de-
mand when the secret of the singing birds first
burst upon us attacked the problem by rendering
this strange music audible to us and he succeeded
as he always succeeded

  how he did it i cannot pretend to explain but
he said that it was as simple in principle as a tele-
phone after many experiments he constructed
three little boxes one for each of us and when we
had attached them over our ears we could actually
hear the sounds produced by the colored undulations

  i can never describe those sounds they thrilled
the very soul they had a strange aerial quality as
if they were the voices of spirits floating in the air
about us the music that they produced reminded
me by the sweetness of its melodies of an ieolian
harp but it was more measured and infinitely more
varied listening to it we felt stirred to depths of
our being of whose existence we had not dreamed

  we were exalted and something beyond human
capacities of enjoyment seemed to have been given
to us yet edmund said that the exquisite pleasure
we were enabled to experience by the aid of his con-
trivances was only a rude imperfect mechanical
reproduction of that which was enjoyed by the
people of venus but we were grateful to him for

affording us this glimpse into the possibilities of a
transcendent development of the physical senses

  it is the nature of venus edmund declared
this world so near the sun receives from the great
orb richer gifts than come to the earth the at-
mosphere here is tremulous with vibrations orig-
inating in the sun which impart a character to
the physical organization of the inhabitants of this
planet which we can hardly imagine their joys are
at the same time more delicate and more intense
than ours

an exploring party

we were never tired of tasting the hew pleasure
that had been partially placed before us but
edmunds restless spirit soon drew us away into
fresh adventures

  he was determined to explore the torrid circle
he had learned from ala that no one had ever been
able to penetrate beyond the place where ingra had
left us to be devoured by the monsters of the great
swamps but with his car he believed that we could
go wherever he chose and he persuaded ala whose
desire for knowledge and love of adventure were
not less than his to consent to a most extraordinary
expedition

  in the preparations for this i believe that we all
forgot the new danger that threatened us since the
opposition of the great oracle had been declared

  whatever might be the form that danger was to
assume it kept itself in the background and worked
in secret i had an uneasy feeling that in some
manner ingra would associate himself with it

  while the people and even the high officials in
the palace apparently knew nothing of what had
occurred i felt certain tha our arch-enemy would
learn of it and remorselessly pursue the advantage
that it gave him

  again and again i was on the point of urging
edmund to leave the planet while there was yet
time and take ala with us if she would consent to
go as he had himself suggested he was so ab-
sorbed in his schemes however that i hesitated
to disturb his thoughts

  in a short time all our preparations were made
and we set out on what i must regard as the wildest
and most inconsiderate adventure that we had yet
undertaken

  we started as usual from the great tower of the
palace our company consisting of eight persons all
that the car could conveniently accommodate these
comprised beside ourselves ala juba two maids
chosen from alas immediate attendants and a high
official of the palace-a sort of majordomo-a very
intelligent person and of great physical strength

  of course we had our weapons both the pistols
and the guns with an abundance of ammunition
and of provisions we were attended by half a
dozen airplanes which were to accompany us as
far as they could go and were there to await our
return from the unknown region

the wonders of venus

we took the direction of the mines and beyond
them we entered the wilderness and soon
found ourselves involved in the zone of clouds and
semi-darkness here at a point where a curiously
shaped mountain peak rising just on the border of
a columbus of space

the twilight-land and pointing its bold outlines
against the strongly illuminated sky behind
served as a landmark which we could not miss on
our return the airplanes were ordered to await us
and we pushed on alone with the car

   jack of course was all alive for this adventure
as he always was for anything promising excite-
ment but henry didnt like it and would have
stayed behind if he had had the courage to remain
alone among strangers for my part my curiosity
was greatly aroused and besides i found immense
interest in watching the enthusiasm of ala

   her adventurous spirit was in its element and
as far as appearances went she gave no thought to
future troubles according to custom the control
of things at the capital had been left in charge of
a sort of board of regency which was a permanent
institution as i learned ala not being the first
queen who was fond of visiting distant parts of the
country though she was the first who had shown a
disposition to explore unknown regions

  on leaving the airplanes behind we plunged
deeper and deeper into gloom and were compelled
to use our electric lights among edmunds special
preparations was a small search-light placed at the
peep-hole in the front end of the car and this was
now brought into requisition

 it gave us startling views of the nature of the
surface beneath

  first we ran for many miles above an area
covered with vast swamps and bogs with the
oddest conceivable shapes of vegetation we were
keen to see some of the gigantic animals which we
knew from our first startling experience inhab-
ited this region and it was not long before the light
found one out

  we were about a hundred feet above the ground
and proceeding slowly when edmund who had
placed himself beside the search-light and was peer-
ing through the opening said quietly

  there would you like to take a look

  ala was beside him in a moment and she could
not repress an exclamation or refrain from starting
backward although in a second she recovered and
laughed at her own nervousness there was room
for only one beside edmund at the little window
and when ala had satisfied her curiosity we each
took our turn

  when mine came i was for an instant almost as
much agitated as ala had been

a strange monster

directly ahead of us not more than seventy-
five yards distant there was a shallow pond
its banks thick with tangled bushes and in the
midst of it stood a monster on eight legs tawny-
colored in the electric light seeming to bristle with
stiff hairs all over its huge round body its head was
relatively small black and apparently armored with
polished jet and faceted with innumerable eyes
which flamed in the brilliant beam poured upon
them

  good lord i could not but exclaim it is
like a prodigious tarantula look it is going to
leap at us

  upon my word said edmund i think the fel-
low does mean fight get away a moment and ill

swing the car round well give him a broadside
if he becomes too ugly

    accordingly the car was swung into such a posi-
 tion that one of the side windows faced the crea-
 ture and edmund brought the movable search-light
 to the window which he threw wide open

   for heavens sake cried henry dont do
 that hell get at us

   dont be alarmed edmund replied he can do
 us no harm we are two hundred feet away

   all of us crowded about the window and it is
 unnecessary to say that the automatic guns were
 in our hands and the pistols ready

   during the few seconds that the streaming light
 had been removed the monster had changed his
 position and now as the glare fell upon him again
 we were startled to find that he had approached us
 he was within forty feet of the car standing in a
 grassy glade having with inconceivable rapidity
 and agility clambered or leaped over the stunted
 trees and bushes surrounding the pond in which we
 had first seen him

   his huge spiky body seemed to bristle with anger
 and his countless eyes blazed like so many great
 rubies in the piercing light it was truly a heart-
 quaking sight

   ala started back with a womanly cry of alarm
 and henry i am almost ashamed to say sank help-
 less upon a bench

   i believe he is going to jump at us said ed-
 mund quietly aim for his head and let him have
 half a dozen shots in quick succession

jacks narrow escape

 t efore anybody could touch a trigger the aw-
 ful creature bounded with lightning speed upon
 the car

   if you have ever seen a hunting-spider leap up-
 on a fly you know the incredible rapidity of its
 spring and its stroke this monster was no less
 swift in his action

   through sheer nervous shock we simultaneously
 discharged our guns but without aim and un-
 fortunately without effect

   the monster struck the car with a force that
 made it roll back and two shaggy legs entered the
 window

   a yell of horror and terror broke from jacks
 lips and in an instant he was dragged from the
 window our terrible assailant dropping out of sight
 at the same moment

   edmund sprang to the controllers and the car
 sank swiftly to the ground as we landed in a
 tangle of bushes edmund leaped out into them
 calling to me to follow then the light streaming
 from the open window fell upon the most awful
 spectacle that a man ever lived to tell about

   the monster was within twenty feet of us hold-
 ing jack high above the ground with the claws of
 two of its legs and turning him round and round
 as a spider prepares a fly for his meal

   the dreadful jaws were open to receive the
 morsel when a stream of fire shot from edmunds
 gun followed instantly by half a dozen more

 the animal reeled and its legs gave way thrash-
 ing the bushes as it tumbled on its side

    jack dropped like lead and i rushed to his side
 while edmund pumped more shots into the huge

 rolling body whose struggles broke the inter-
 twining branches with terrible crashes

  as i reached jack he resembled a shapeless lump
edmund rushed back as soon as he could to look
at him

chapter xx
in the whirlwinds of venus

ut the case proved on examination not to
be so bad after all

  jack was not dead and the great beast
was

  still the poor fellow seemed terribly injured
his clothing was ripped to shreds and his face was
disfigured he had been rolled up almost into a ball
and i marveled when i saw him stretch out his legs
for i thought that every bone must have been
broken

  his athletic training had perhaps saved him his
joints being supple and his muscles elastic

  just in time he muttered trying bravely to
smile he had me in his jaws once but i kicked
away

  as we lifted him between us to carry him back
to the car ala approached pushing her way with
anxious face through the tangle of weeds and
shrubs juba his great eyes shining like flames
was close behind her

  ala uttered a cry of joy when she saw that we
were safe but her face was filed with pity as her
eyes fell upon jack she helped juba to open a way
for us back to the car

  no sooner had we placed the injured man on the
floor than she was on her knees beside him striv-
ing to stanch the wounds on his face and hands
she and edmund worked together as if they had
been trained nurses

  they tore up garments to make bandages and
in a little while jack looked like a patient in an
emergency hospital fortunately he seemed to
have no internal injuries and edmund declared
that barring the possibility of poison from the
fangs there was no danger of a fatal result

jacks courage

nevertheless he said we must start on our
return at once

  not on your life jack exclaimed see here
edmund i wont go back this expedition is not
going to be ruined on account of such a little ac-
cident its just beginning to get interesting

  but you may be poisoned said edmund

  stuff and nonsense returned jack theres
no poison about it i tell you i wont go back im
not going to be scared out by a beast like that
youve finished him and that ends it

  at first edmund insisted but jack was so ob-
stinate and he really seemed so strong that at
length edmund said

  well well go on a little way if jack seems to
be the worse for it well put back again at top
speed

   so it was decided and we kept on

  no one had any desire to examine the monster
we had slain but edmund declared that in the
interests of science he ought at least to photograph
him with a flash-light and we did pause long enough

for that hovering over the place with the car but
the picture when developed showed nothing but a
blur

  no other adventure happened at once and we
saw no more of the strange inhabitants of the fens
who had probably been scared off by the noise and
the light

  for a long time we bore away in the darkness
without any guide except a general sense of direc-
tion in that respect edmund was the most re-
markable person i have ever known it seemed
impossible for him to be lost he could make his
way through the air like a migrating bird

  after a long while it began to grow a little lighter
ahead i though that we had inadvertently turned
on our course and were approaching the temperate
zone but edmund averred that he had not lost
his direction and that the light must come from
some other source before the darkness around us
had begun perceptibly to lift i happened to glance
out of one of the windows and noticed a strange
fluttering in the air

  huge inky shadows seemed to be flitting through
the gloom

strange shadows

presently there cams a smart blow against
the car and for an instant something covered
the window everybody was greatly startled and
we looked out at both sides but could see nothing
except the curious shadows that i had first noticed

  the air was misty around us and the shadows
except for their blackness resembled apparitions
like the spectre of the brocken cut upon the dark
fog by moving objects whose position we could not
immediately determine

  there is something odd overhead said ed-
mund at length and ill steer a little higher to see
what it is

  no sooner had the car started gliding on an up-
ward slope than a perfect thunder of raps began
on the outside like heavy hail on a roof at the
same time both of the windows were covered by
moving forms the nature of which we could not
determine so fast did they flit by

  but it was evident that they were hitting the
car and causing the noise suddenly the rapping
ceased and the forms disappeared from the win-
dows but now again the ebon shadows began
fluttering in the mist all about the car

  what has become of those things and what are
they anyhow demanded jack nervously owing
to his comparative helplessness he was no doubt
more startled and alarmed than he would otherwise
have been

  i dont know what they are edmund replied
but i do know that they are overhead again and
im going to keep the car rising until i find out
what the mystery means

  but what makes the shadows i asked where
does the light come from

  of course it must come from above edmund
replied since the shadows are below our level and
appear all around us i take it that the sun is
breaking through the clouds overhead but what
the objects are that cast the shadows i cant guess
that they are very much alive and that their name
a columbus of space



is legion are facts which require no demonstration
after our recent experience	a

  all this time we were rising and in a few mo-
ments the strange phenomenon recurred the
thunder of blows again fell upon the car and the in-
distinguishable rush by the windows was resumed
ala turned slightly pale her maids cowered to-
gether henry hid his face and even edmund
seemed disconcerted

  its very strange he muttered ill have to
turn on the search-light

a flock of bats

this had been extinguished upon the closing of
the glass of the window when we resumed our
journey edmund not taking the trouble then to
replace the apparatus at the forward lookout he
now put the light in its original position and as
its brilliant beam sprang out into the darkness
placed himself close by the small opening after
a moment of intense gazing he looked back over
his shoulder with a queer expression

  catching my eye he beckoned to me and i went
to his side

  look out there he said in a low voice

  as i did so i was unable to repress an exclama-
tion the shaft of light fell upon thousands of
huge flapping wings belonging to what i can only
liken to enormous bats which were whirling about
the car and blindly striking by hundreds against
it as they rushed on in an endless procession

  soon it became apparent that they were revolving
in a vast circle and their previous sudden disap-
pearance was explained when as if at a signal they
all turned their flight upward and rose again above
the level of the car

  the things looked so uncanny that i shuddered
at the recollection of the sight while edmund
seemed lost in thought

  what is it called out jack impatiently from
his bench what do you see

  while i was trying to frame an answer edmund
spoke up in words that filled me with surprise

  its the next step to hades i reckon is what he
said

  jack didnt catch his drift and i had to think
a moment before i asked

  what in the world do you mean

i mean this replied edmund seizing one of the
knobs and giving it a sudden turn weve got to
get up out of here before the tempest strikes us
you dont think that they can harm us do you
i said with my mind on the flying creatures

  not they but what they announce hold on
tight now for i am going to make her spin
before touching the knob again he took ala by
the band and made her sit on one of the benches
showing her how to hold herself firmly in position
then he planted himself by his controllers and a
moment later we felt the car bound upward

a tempest on venus

but the warning which edmund had read in the
conduct of the gigantic birds had come too late
we shot through their array knocking them right
and left by thousands as we rushed upward but
the deafening sound thus created was nothing to the
awful uproar that immediately succeeded

  i turned dizzy as the car began to spin and plung
like a cork in a whirlpool

  we were caught in a tempest with a vengeance
it was getting lighter outside but the light was
more fearful than the darkness it was a lurid red
gleam that made the boiling clouds which surged
against the windows resemble foam upon a sea
of blood whipped to madness by furiously battling
winds

  all that we had experienced in the terrible pas-
sage of the crystal mountains was childs play to
this

  the howling and shrieking of the wind was
enough to drive one mad it seemed to blow a
dozen ways at once the car rolled bobbed tossed
and plunged and despite all our efforts we were
flung upon the floor striking against one another
grasping at supports out of breath helpless with
terror all shouting at intervals and nobody hearing
a word in the hubbub of noises

  edmund abandoned all efforts to control the car
and devoted himself to saving ala as much as he
could

  he held her in his arms and braced himself in
a corner where two of the benches running along
the walls met even in that terible excitement i
noticed a look of confidence in her face as she fixed
her eyes upon edmund jack suffered fearfully
from the shocks he received and i did my best to
aid him

  once i caught edmunds eye and he glanced
meaningly upward which i took for an intimation
that the car was still rising and that he looked for
deliverance from our peril in that way but there
were certainly times when we plunged downward
with fearful speed for we would be almost lifted
from the floor by the inertia

  this dreadful scene may have lasted an hour or
it may have lasted not more than twenty minutes
but it seemed endless the change came with great
suddenness

  one moment we were rolling and pitching as
usual and the next-it was all over

the danger over

phe car seemed to have been struck dead it was
a so absolutely motionless at the same instant
the howling of the wind passed away in a dying
scream my ears rang still with the echo and i
was too dizzy to stand straight

  in a few moments it became evident that the mo-
tionlessness of the car was only apparent we were
still rising edmund gently placed ala on a bench
and went to the controllers after turning a couple
of knobs he faced about with a cheering smile

  we are out of it he said there is no more
danger the only thing there was to do was to keep
on rising we are now above the denser part of the
atmosphere and the cyclones are whirling far be-
neath us i will bring the car to rest and if i am
not mistaken you will look down upon a scene that
you will not soon forget

  i cannot open the air-tight glass shutters he
continued because at the elevation where we now
are the air is too rare especially for ala and her
friends-but by inclining the car a little to one side
we can have a good view

there was an arrangement of movable weights


amazing stories

sliding upon bars to produce an inclination toward
one side or the other and in a few minutes edmund
had the car which was now practically at rest so
canted that one of the large windows afforded a view
almost directly downward

an amazing view from the air

the spectacle beneath drove the memory of an
awful experience for the moment from the
minds of all the sun was shining brilliantly over-
head and its light fell upon a raging sea of clouds
which except at their edges where they were torn
into flying scud looked as dense as white molten
metal

  a hundred tornadoes appeared to be whizzing at
once all turning in the same direction with sicken-
ing velocity and where these whirlwinds came to-
gether their peripheries moving opposite ways it
was as if two gigantic buzz-saws had met each
plowing the other to pieces and whirling the frag-
ments round in the wildest confusion the play of
lightning was fierce and incessant but when we
were in the midst of it it had passed unnoticed the
thunder being blended with the roar of the wind

  good heavens cried jack holding himself pain-
fully erect at the window did we come through
that

  indeed we did replied edmund and i dont
mind saying that i shouldnt like to venture such a
trip again

  but what does it all mean i asked

  its meaning is clear enough in penetrating to-
ward the torrid circle where the unsetting sun is
forever in the zenith we have entered the zone of
tempests that surrounds it the heated air is al-
ways rising above the area enclosed in the central
circle and flowing off above on all sides

  colder air rushes in below to take its place and
at a certain distance from the center which we
have reached the contending currents come together
with the results that you see

  ala who had resumed all of her usual self com-
mand was one of the most eager of the watchers of
this spectacle and edmund and she communed to-
gether for a long time pointing out and discussing
the marvelous features of the scene

  at last i asked edmund

  what do you mean to do next go back
no he replied at least well not go back the
way we came having got so far i think well cir-
cumnavigate the planet and take a birds-eye look
at it jack seems to be getting along pretty well
and by keeping near the upper limit of the atmo-
sphere we can travel so fast that the whole trip will
not occupy more than twenty-four hours

  thats it cried jack that suits me exactly to
go back the way we came would look as if we had
been beaten

  the talk of going back set my mind once more on
the dangers that were probably gathering for us at
the capital and i could not refrain from saying
quietly to edmund

  you know you ought to get back as soon as pos-
sible for i am sure there are plots hatching that
may have terrible consequences remember that the
eagle beak on the black throne is against us and
our absence with ala leaves him a free field ingra
too is at liberty

  but edmund only smiled at my gloomy forebod-
ings

  you borrow too much trouble he said

  but neither he in his buoyant optimism nor i
with my half-defined suspicions foresaw what was
coming

chapter xxi

the land of night again

although the sun was now continually over-
head and entirely unclouded we did not suf-
fer from its heat because we were running
at so great an elevation that the air was rarer than
on the loftiest terrestrial mountain and the rays
that struck the outside of the polished car were re-
flected off without penetrating

  but on the planet below us buried in its blanket
of heavy air the effect of the intense and unceasing
solar radiation was terrific we had already seen
one of its results in the belt of cyclones but as we
passed over that and entered the central torrid cir-
cle we beheld if possible still more dreadful in-
dications of the merciless action of the sun

  when we had left the region of clouds and storms
behind the bare surface of the planet became visi-
ble and edmund kept one side of the car inclined
downward to give us a better view from the win-
dow

a desert on venus

we were many miles above the ground and the
smaller details were not visible even with our
binoculars but we did not dare to drop lower be-
cause of the heat which in spite of our great dis-
tance came to our faces even through the thick
glass like the blast of a furnace

   evidently no life could exist on that scorched sur-
face and not a drop of water could stay there mil-
lions of square miles of land lay literally roasting
and its prevailing dark-brick color suggested the
idea that it was red-hot

  there was no temptation to linger here and in a
short while we rose entirely above the atmosphere
in order as edmund said to make it safe for him to
turn the interplanetary knob and set the car go-
ing at a speed of more than a mile a second in
this way the transit of the torrid circle though it
was thousands of miles broad was effected in an
hour and upon approaching the opposite border we
saw again the ring of swirling clouds that encloses
it all round

  jack who was now rapidly recovering the use of
his limbs stood with us most of the time at the
window and as he saw the clouds passing far be-
neath the thought seemed for the first time to strike
his mind that in circumnavigating the planet we
should once more visit the scene of our first adven-
ture on the dark hemisphere

  by jove edmund he suddenly sang out well
have to cross those mountains again

  of course we will said edmund but it will
be a simple matter now well go miles above their
tops

  and hooray well visit the caverns jack
went on with rising spirits juba old boy slap-
ping him on the latters hairy back you are going
to see your old home once more do you understand
            i

a columbus of space	

 but we wont leave you there no sirree we cant
 part with you i want to see you in new york once

    but if juba shmiid want to stay with his friends
 - i began

 then hell have to stay edmund interrupted
 gravely and i am going to advise him to stay

    aw juba wont want to stay said jack laugh-
 ing he likes our company too well

    but edmunds words and manner set me to worry-
 ing again about what was going an behind our backs
 at the capital and i was impatient to return and
 have it out and then get away for good

    edmund saw the trend of my thoughts-i believe
 he was beginning to acquire something of alas
 power of mind-reading-and he said to me in an
 aside

    dont be so down-hearted itll come out all
 right keep your courage up and help me with the
 others

    we passed over the storm-zone at high speed and
 then came the temperate or inhabited zone but the
 part of it now beneath our eyes was on the opposite
 side of the planet from the capital it appeared to
 be dotted with villages and occasionally the towers
 of a considerable city were visible ala however
 informed edmund that this portion of venus was
 mainly devoted to agriculture and contained no
 great towers we were so high that the airplanes
 in sight seemed to be crawling upon the ground

leaving the night hemisphere

 a nother belt of clouds ahead soon reminded us
 that we were rapidly approaching the borders
 of the night hemisphere and our expectations be-
 came eagerly alive ala especially was nervously
 excitable over the prospect

    now at last she was to enter that mysterious
 country which none of her people had ever succeeded
 in penetrating and concerning which so many su-
 perstitions and traditions existed the majestic
 majordomo who had behaved with commendable
 equanimity through all of our adventures thus far
 showed a little nervousness i thought when ala
 explained to him what was about to happen i
 watched juba closely but his face was impassive

   the night hemisphere you will remember is
 ringed outside the crystal mountains by another zone
 of tempests and a broad sea into which the rivers
 periodically formed by the melting ice pour wd
 were now so high that the storms did not trouble us
 and we admired at our leisure the shining expanse
 of sea surface whitened with foam that showed
 through shifting breaks in the tempestuous clouds

    presently edmund who had been watching from
 the lookout slowed down and swung the car half-
 way round

    nows your chance he said take a look at
 the mountains before we cross them

 we all crowded round the window there they
 lay those terrific ice peaks in a long glittering line
 upon the horizon their tops were wreathed in
 straggling clouds through which occasionally darted
 a diamond-bright flash where the level sunlight was
 reflected from some smooth flank of pure ice

 i wonder if we can see the place where we were
 imprisoned by the fall of the car said jack

 no edmund replied that is over on the
 other side remember we are approaching the dark

 hemisphere at a point opposite to where we left
 it

   but the snow mountains seem just the same
 here

an arctic cold on venus

ccnpo be sure why shouldnt they he the same

        the planet is completely ranged wrfch them for
 the moisture-laden air flows off equally on dll ftfcfes
 of the globe

   we were already it sueh an elevation that we
 could clear the mountains and the stowwy ah ffiat
 raged above their heads and edmund after fifteen
 minutes stoppage resumed the journey gradually
 a marvelous scene opened around us

    the air seemed to darken and the stars began to
 appear these grew brighter as the night deepened
 and soon they glowed with incieatele brfbfeitcy it
 was so long since my eyes had beheld item that i
 was astonished by their brightness and their mul-
 titude but the effect upon ala and her atteniants
 was indescribable

   you must remember that none of them had ever
 seen a star before and now suddenly they bcfcdfd
 thousands they could not comprehend the meaning
 of the wonderful spectacle it was such a revelaffen
 of the universe as they had never dreamed of

    when we had passed completely wifcfem ffie realm
 of darkness with the crystal mountains oifte more
 flaming in fiery shapes behind us edinurid brought
 the car to rest

    he had already started the electric heaters and
 clothed ala in furs and now the rest of tfs got out
 our arctic garments from the lockers

    i am now preparing to drop down to the ground
 edmund said in order to take our bearings a
 few observations of the stars will enable me to
 orient myself arid then we can set out with con-
 fidence in search of the caverns

   the descent was made rapidly and then in our
 warm clothing we stepped out of the car upon tho
 icy shingle

    ala shivered at the touch of the glacial air and
 her maids and the majordomo quickly fled back into
 the shelter of the car but edmund wished ala to
 remain outside and he doubled the furs covering her
 until she intimated that she no longer felt any dis-
 comfort from the cold then he got out his instru-
 ments of observation

    but first he pointed out the earth and the moon
 to ala that was a thrilling moment to all of us

    how splendid our old planet looked up there and
 how proud we felt as we watched edmund endeavor-
 ing to make his companion comprehend what it was
 that she saw i think that he succeeded at least
 so far that she understood that it was our world
 which shone so splendidly overhead

 do you understand what this means asked ed-
 mund suddenly turning to me

i understand that that is the earth of course

i replied

 but are you not surprised to find it still so high
 overhead here

then the truth burst upon me

a year of the venus calendar

 ttfhy yes i exclaimed it means that a
 v t whole year has elapsed since we arrived upon


amazing stories

venus she has gone round her orbit and con-
back into conjunction with the earth

  more than a year edmund replied some five
hundred and eighty days for that is about the time
from one conjunction to the next

  do you mean to say that we have been here al-
most twenty months cried jack

  there is the evidence edmund responded as-
tronomy doesnt lie

  well said jack its the shortest twenty months
in my experience

  henry after his fashion said nothing but looked
gloomy and disgruntled in the glare of the electric
light streaming from the car

  having finished his observations edmund an-
nounced that he now knew his course and could take
us directly to the caverns of jubas people but be-
fore entering the car he took ala again by the
arm and they stood together for a long time gazing
up at the earth and the stars while he communed
with her telling her in that strange language i
know not what marvelous things which must have
been revelations of enormous significance to her in-
telligence

  i can see them yet standing there side by side
and i can recall the very expression of her beautiful
eyes peering out of the hooding furs as she drank
in his thoughts with a look of mingled love and
admiration and confidence

  at length we reentered the car and rising to a
moderate elevation resumed our journey at a rapid
pace the pathless frozen desert beneath us glit-
tered occasionally in the starlight and after a long
time we caught sight of the well-remembered shafts
of light rising from the ground

  we are getting into the inhabited region said
edmund we shall have to search a little for land-
marks he added because of course my observa-
tions are not as accurate as those of a geodetic sur-
vey and i cannot locate the precise position of
jubas caverns but i can come very close to them
and i depend upon juba himself to aid in finding the
exact spot

  since our arrival in the dark hemisphere i had
frequently studied jubas countenance and i de-
tected many signs of the interest that the poor fel-
low experienced in finding himself once more in
his own land still it seemed to me that jack was
right and that juba would prefer to stay with us
than to remain with his people

the caverns once more

we passed over several groups of inhabited
caverns but we saw no signs of life except the
light shafts issuing upward

  we now ran close to the surface and kept a
sharp outlook suddenly juba slapped his hairy
hands with an expression of delight and pointed to
a row of lights which he seemed to recognize

  thats it said edmund i was sure he would
know when he was at home

  there was no mistake about it juba had recog-
nized his own village so to speak probably by the
arrangement of the shafts in a little while we our-
selves became aware of a certain familiar aspect of
the landscape and almost without hesitation we
approached the mouth of our ovm cavern then we

came softly down to the ground and the door was
thrown open

  hold on said jack lets give them a surprise
lets fire a gun in salute

  edmund made no objection and jack who had
almost entirely recovered his activity fired the sig-
nal

  as the sound rattled through the frozen air we
waited with great curiosity standing within a few
rods of the terrible altar on which i had nearly been
sacrificed

  presently two or three hairy heads appeared at
the caverns mouth juba immediately ran toward
them they disappeared like frightened rabbits and
juba dashed down the steps in pursuit we halted
at the top to let him soothe the fears of his com-
patriots in a short time he reappeared with a
dozen companions

  evidently he had explained the situation and i
was rather surprised at the apparent indifference
with which they greeted us we seemed much more
glad to see them than they were to see us i recog-
nized several well-known faces among them

  then accompanied by ala and her attendants
we descended escorted by juba who seemed to take
great pride in leading us arrived at the first un-
derground apartment we found a great crowd of
the hairy natives assembled

juba meets his friends

the women were more cordial in their greetings
than the men and seemed especially interested
in ala and her maids i expected to see some indica-
tions of concern over the fate of those who had been
lost in the flood but i observed none and i do not
really know whether or not any explanation of their
absence was given by juba

  while most of our party remained in this cham-
ber edmund took ala and the majordomo on an ex-
ploration of the deeper parts of the cavern ala
expressed the greatest interest in everything she
saw edmund told me that he showed her the coal-
mines the black-smith shop and all the curiosities
of the place

  but there was no reason for lingering there and
as soon as edmund had completed his circuit pre-
parations were made for our departure then ed-
mund took juba aside and tried as he had said he
would to persuade the fellow to remain with his
own people but juba was deaf to all arguments
and at last edmund throwing up his hands said

  well its no use juba is determined to go back
with us so well have to take him

  poor juba

  i often think of him now how infinitely better
it would have been for him if he had not been so
fond of the strangers who had dropped into his
gloomy world out of the starry sky

   chapter xxii

at the capital

    need not detain you with an account of our
    return trip

      edmund again laid his course by the stars
and running at a high elevation we passed over the
crystal mountains and their warring tempests be-
lieving that we could recogniw with our glasses the
a columbus of space

 huge jeweled peak that had once so nearly wrought
 our destruction edmund pointed this out to ala as
 she clung to his arm and then we crossed the sea
 where we had first met her and were soon coursing
 under the great cloud-dome in the land of filtered
 sunshine

   upon reaching the capital the same scenes of
 jubilation were renewed but there was great sur-
 prise at our reappearing from exactly the opposite
 direction to that in which we had been expected
 an airplane was at once despatched to recall those
 who were waiting for us on the border of the twi-
 light zone

   there can be no doubt that the forebodings which
 had so long occupied my mind tended to color my
 judgment yet i would have sworn that i detected
 a change in the moral atmosphere of the capital
 our greeting from the people was hearty as usual
 but there were faces which seemed to me to wear a
 half-concealed scowl and i caught occasionally an
 unfriendly glance in the crowd

   these things impressed me so deeply that again i
 warned edmund

   the current is beginning to run against us i
 told him i am sure of it

   this time he did not laugh at my fears on the
 contrary he said

   yes i believe you are right but i am not
 afraid we have weathered worse storms

   but what will you do

 let events take their course and watch them
 then you may be too late listen to me pre-
 pare the car get alas consent to go for i believe
 she would follow you anywhere and start for the
 earth at the earliest possible moment

   edmund mused a little while then he said

   the day after to-morrow

   the day after to-morrow i replied impa-
 tiently why trifle thus you know that there are
 no days and to-morrows in this kind of endless
 light

   edmund smiled

   count forty-eight hours by your watch he
 said  and at the end of that time i promise you to
 start

   this promise heartened me immensely but i did
 not know what that day after to-morrow had in
 store the blow was nearer falling than i could have
 suspected

   it was hastened without doubt by an occurrence
 which nobody could foresee or govern and which
 if it had happened at the time of our first arrival
 would probably have had no mischievous conse-
 quences for us

   but since that fatal interview in the temple all
 was changed and an event more disastrous for us
 than that which now occurred ingra himself could
 not have devised

 the opening of the cloud dome
 tt was the opening of the cloud-dome

 - i have already told you that at certain unpre-
 dictable times a rift appeared in the pearly vault of
 the heavens and the sun for a few minutes blazed
 down through the opening in unclouded splendor
 so many years had elapsed since the last occurrence
 of this phenomenon that for the younger genera-
 tion it was only a tradition yet it was a tradition



 on which the pagan religious system-of which the
 eagle-faced sphinx in the red-lighted temple was
 the head-center-was based and its influence upon
 the ignorant and superstitious multitude was un-
 bounded and irresistible

   this terrible priest whose hatred of us had of
 course been stimulated by alas open defiance had
 as i feared occupied the time of our absence in
 poisoning as many minds as possible against us
 and his sacred character had enabled him to spread
 the venom of religious prejudice with amazing ra-
 pidity even if we had not wasted time on our un-
 fortunate expedition i do not know that we could
 have done much to counteract his pernicious in-
 fluence but then at least we should have been
 ready at an earlier date to escape from his clutches

   and who knows what ala with her great popu-
 tenty might have accomplished if she had been on
 the ground  i did not doubt for a moment that in-
 gra was in the capital and thick in the plot

   the opening of the dome came very suddenly it
 was announced by a great shout-a rare occurrence
 from the people who happened to be on the outer
 platforms of the palace tower

   we were all with ala at the time edmund being
 engaged in trying to decipher the curious characters
 in a large book which she had brought him

   upon hearing the shout we all ran out

   the scene was one of the most unforgettable
 things that occurred in our whole expedition ex-
 cited people were crowding the platforms jostling
 one another jabbering pushing and pointing up-
 ward some already on their knees others with looks
 of the utmost consternation throwing their arms
 wildly above their heads while hundreds of airplanes
 were circling like frightened birds above the towers

the venerians see the sun

t glanced upward following the direction of thou-

 	sands of eyes and was momentarily blinded by
 the fierce glare of the sun pouring its unmitigated
 rays straight down through a narrow rift in the
 cloud-dome

   the gold and jewels that decorated the tower mado
 it blaze with a splendor like that of a huge frost-
 gemmed tree struck by the morning rays after a
 winter nights ice-storm it wa too dazzling to look
 upon

   then there was a movement in the vast throng a
 space cleared itself and the gigantic augur wearing
 a great black miter flaming with circles of rubies
 and carbuncles appeared his strange beak project-
 ing ominously and his black eyes aglow

   thousands instantly dropped on their knees as he
 slowly advanced with one long arm carrying a sort
 of crozier he pointed aloft while he muttered a
 chant that fell like a charm upon the superstitious
 multitude

   i glanced at ala

   she did not stir and i felt my heart give an ex-
 ultant bound with the conviction which flashed over
 me that her active penetrating mind had flung off
 the burden of this superstition how much edmund
 had been able to teach her i do not know but i
 gave him all credit for the change

 soon the terrible priest directed hi menacing
 glance upon us as we continued standing after ali
 the others had abjectly fallen before him


amazing stories

   if his eyes had glared before they turned to liv-
ing flames now with a majestic stride he advanced
toward ala and i thought for a moment that he
meant to strike her down with his staff edmund
pushed her behind him and i shall never cease to
thrill at the recollection that i with a boldness that
surprised and gratified me afterward sprang in-
stantly to edmunds side with jack-brave old jack
at my elbow

  what we should have done next i do not know
for our enemy hesitated

an anathema

whether he was cowered by our menacing
aspect or whether he thought it unbecoming
his dignity to attack us physically at any rate he
stopped short then towering to his full height
he made one vast sweep with his arms and covered
us i suppose with a withering anathema

as far as he was concerned that apparently ended

 it

  he paid us no more attention after that than if
we had been so many sticks but directed his gaze
straight at the sun i saw its rays sparkle in the
corner of his black eyes which never winked and
i nope i may be forgiven for wishing as i did that
iiis god would strike him blind on the spot

   as i glanced around i caught side looks from the
prostrate worshippers which boded no good

   suddenly a cold hand seemed to have been planted
over the pit of my stomach for there lifting his
head above the kneeling crowd and staring at us
with a wicked grin was ingra an instant later
and before i could speak to edmund he was gone

   this capped the climax of my apprehensions the
mere fact that ingra dared to show himself here
attested the change that had occurred in our situa-
tion after a moments thought i determined not
to tell edmund at present what i had seen

  the spectacle of the opening of the dome ended
as unexpectedly as it had begun the rift closed
and then for a few moments the contrast between
the unclouded brilliance of the sun and the soft
glow that succeeded had an effect as if we had been
plunged into night

   finally objects became clearer there was a great
movement of the closely packed throng the people
rose from their knees and the black priest had gone
as mysteriously as if he had been snatched up into
the sky

chapter xxiii

the blow falls

after the scene that i have tried to describe in
the last chapter events hurried on with a rapid-
ity which was not apparent upon their surface

   i believe that edmund with all his perspicacity
failed to appreciate their meaning in fact he was
himself responsible for giving them an impetus to-
ward the inevitable crisis which but for the prema-
ture step that he and ala took might have been de-
layed considerably

   but i shall come to that in a few minutes

  as the excitement of the crowd died down the
people began to move about in groups communing
together about the marvel that they had witnessed

the unfavorable attitude toward us was spreading
among them

  it was plain that it had grown enormously in
strength since the scene with the augur and the
impression quickly reached those who had not been
near enough to see for themselves

   i could not speak immediately to edmund because
he was continually in conference with ala but get-
ting jack aside in order not to alarm henry who
was already in a pitiable state of moral collapse i
opened my mind to him

   jack i said edmund has promised to get away
soon

   well thatll be a good thing i reckon was the
reply

  what do you think of the sentiment of this
crowd

   i shouldnt like to trust myself alone in it but
say didnt we back the old medicinc-man down in
great shape

  i dont think we backed him down at all i
replied he has better ways of ruining us than by
attacking us with a big stick

  humph said jack id have had the drop on
him if hed made another move

   but you are in favor of our getting away at the
earliest possible moment

   oh yes i think wed better go ive had enough
of venus but im not for backing down if ed-
mund can take ala along all right thats a little
romance thats got to go through

   weve got the religious sentiments of these peo-
ple against us now i said and we cant afford to
stay an unnecessary minute

the danger thickens

anpheir religious sentiments be hanged ex-
i- claimed jack whats their religion a set
of pagans but by jove these girls of venus are
great i only wish i could have had edmunds luck
he may not be as lucky as he seems i re-
plied but come jack i want you to help me per-
suade edmund to start even sooner than he has
promised-in fact right away

  jack stared at me a moment

  see here albert he said im with you in
thinking that the sooner were off the better but
im not for budging a step until edmund gives the
word he knows his affairs and alas

   when theyre ready off we go as far as im con-
cerned but that girl has got to be left to choose
her time and if edmund wants to stay and become
king of venus im not the man to coax him away
there was no more to he made out of jack i
thought it would do no good to tell him that ingra
was here for probably he would be all the more
eager to stay and fight it out

   at the first opportunity however i brought ed-
mund back to the subject of getting away he saw
what was in my mind before i could speak

  what does your watch say he asked good-
naturedly is it day after to-morrow yet

  no of course not but listen edmund dont
you see how the peril thickens around us i pro-
test that i am no coward but it would be defying
fate to stay here any longer cant you persuade
ala to go at once

edmund paused a minute before replying and
a columbus of space



then he said with some embarrassment of manner
i promised you to start in forty-eight hours i
thought that it could be managed else i shouldnt
have promised but things have taken another turn
ala refuses to go and you know laying his hand
on my arm that i cant leave her

edmunds determination

t ut what do you propose then to stay here
  -o all your life

  thats it

  there was no trace of regret in his tone it was
plain that henceforth this and not his mother earth
was to be edmunds world

  before i could say anything in reply he went on
but of course i dont mean to keep you and
jack and henry here i am going to show you
exactly how to manage the car and i feel sure that
you can navigate her home as well as i could my-
self

  the idea of parting from edmund of leaving him
alone on this distant planet while we returned to the
earth had never crossed my mind now coming so
suddenly it quite overwhelmed me

  i had long ago forgotten to feel the least resent-
ment because he had practically kidnapped us and
brought us way off here against our knowledge and
against our will it seemed to me like desertion to
leave him and i could not reconcile myself to the
thought

  i felt a lump rising in my throat and it would
not surprise me if there were tears in my eyes

  but edmund i finally managed to say you
cant stay you know and ala cant stay the lives
of both of you will be sacrificed your enemies are
too numerous and too powerful

  no he replied cheerfully we shall run no
great danger ala believes that she can stem the
tide and i believe it too for there never was an-
other such a woman she proposes tftat we meet the
machinations of the chief priest with a counter-
stroke

  what sort of counterstroke can you deal

  you know how popular ala has always been and
you know also how charmed the whole population
was with the news of our romance it is the in-
grained nature of these children of the sun they
passionately love the romantic and the beautiful

  we believe that we can overcome the opposition
of the superstitious element and rouse enthusiastic
devotion to ourselves by publicly proclaiming our
betrothal and celebrating our nuptials at the ear-
liest possible moment and we are going to do it
i was struck dumb-the thing was so unexpected
and to my mind so preposterous

  why edmund i at last managed to say
thats the very thing to bring your enemies down
upon you

  if you are determined to stay here on venus all
right for heavens sake dont take a step so
openly defiant as that which you propose keep in
the background and get ala to try her arts of per-
suasion until the storm blows over

  nothing that i could urge moved him he and
ala had made up their minds and that was the end
of it

  he wound up the discussion by asking me to go
at once to the car in order that he might instruct

me in the management of the controllers ala as
well as jack henry and juba accompanied us

  the mere knowledge of ingras presence was
sufficient to make edmund wish to have ala con-
tinually under his eye and the others followed where
they saw us going the lesson was not long for
already i had a general idea of the management of
the machinery but it was rendered a little difficult
by the tacit understanding between edmund and me
that henry should not be told what was in the wind

  he would be glad enough to go home but we were
sure that he would oppose any one acting as engineer
except edmund the affair was managed without
exciting henrys suspicions afterward i got jack
aside and toid him the whole story

  as i expected he adopted edmunds view at
once

  just the thing to do he declared but i tell
you what im more than half disposed to stay here
myself if edmund does

  do as you like jack i replied but im going
to get away just as soon as i am certain that ed-
mund and ala cannot after all be persuaded to go
and that they are in no immediate danger

  you are not to suppose fom what i have said
that ala was deserted by her people in the midst of
the serious trouble in which she and we had involved
ourselves her self-confidence as exhibited in the
plan which she had formed with edmund was alone
a sufficient indication that she had plenty of friends
left and that her rank and character still protected
her

the betrothal

as soon then as she had informed these friends
and faithful supporters of her design they loy-
ally aided her to put it into execution at a less an-
xious moment i should have eagerly examined into
all the details of the singular ceremony by which
the betrothal of the queen to a stranger of another
race and from another world was to be proclaimed
to her people as it was my mind was too full and
only the culminating scene was stamped on my
memory

  the immense palace-tower and hundreds of other
towers all over the city were decorated as we had
never seen them before the display of color was
amazing even after our experience

  most beautiful of all i thought was the spectacle
presented by the thousands of airplanes and airships
in gala dress they spiraled about so countless and
so brilliant so swift and so graceful in their mazy
circlings that one seemed to be plunged into the
midst of a vast swarm of the most gorgeous butter-
flies

  so dazzling and fascinating a spectacle was never
conceived by the most ingenious inventor of carni-
vals and ballets

  but even while i stood admiring it i could not
drive away the thought that this wonderful display
was in itself simply a defiance to our enemies the
waving of the toreadors scarlet flag and i shud-
dered at consequences which i could not foresee

  the hour for the final ceremony was now close at
hand and we were all to take a conspicuous part in
it standing with ala and edmund to receive the
congratulations of the people after a priest whom
c

amazing stories

ala had won over to her side had publicly pro-
claimed their betrothal

  ala beautiful as i had never yet seen her was
already habited in white garments glittering with
diamonds and edmund had been fitted out in appro-
priate dress which splendidly set off his magnificent
figure with a jeweled fillet resting amid his dark
curls

preparing to return to the earth

while we waited thus in one of the upper
apartments of the palace-tower an irresistible
impulse came to me to examine the car which had
been removed to a neighboring tower i do not
know why i suddenly felt this desire-it may have
been some suspicion of possible meddling by ingra
-but at any rate i immediately yielded to it

  i had a key to the chamber in which the car was
locked and i said to edmund who was in high
spirits

  i want to run over to look at the car

  all right he replied but you must be back in
a quarter of an hour without fail

  ill be back i responded and summoned an air-
boat waiting at the landing

  jack and henry at once expressed a desire to
accompany me and i consented we were not a
minute in crossing the space separating the palace
from the adjoining tower and while jack and henry
remained on the landing of the latter admiring the
scene before them i approached the locked chamber
containing the car as i put the key in the door i
asked myself

  what am i here for im hanged if i know
but anyhow ill take a look

  i opened the door and entered the car was ap-
parently all right and while i was looking it over
with no particular design i heard jacks voice raised
in great excitement

  i ran to the door and a gush of heat smote me
in the face a single glance showed me that the
palace was in flames vast tongues of fire were
leaping up from its lower stories licking the in-
numerable brilliant balconies which burst into flame
as if they had been so much tinder

  stunned for an instant by the awful sight the
next moment i leaped into the air-boat pushing
jack and henry before me but even as we did this
the material of the boat caught fire and its engineer
sprang back upon the platform of the tower

quick i shouted we must get the car out

  we dashed into the apartment containing it and
now the value of edmunds recent instructions was
shown but for them i should never have been able
to manage it in such an emergency

  madly we pushed it out into the furnace of heat
for our own tower had caught fire ind as we
sprang inside i turned on the power ve rose like
a shot out of the flame and smoke

  immediately i swung round on the other side of
the palace opposite to that where we had been here
as i hoped the flames had not yet mounted to the
level that they had attained on the other side but
a sight met my eyes that for a moment drove me
mad with rage

the conflagration

there with a single steersman in an air-boat
was ingra torch in hand spreading the con-
flagration  forgetting in my fury what i had come
for i drove the car straight against him he turned
with startled eyes and saw us bearing down upon
him he read death in my face and his own grew
pale

  desperately he endeavored to evade the encounter
but the steel car struck his boat like a ram crushed
in its side and sent ingra and his unfortunate com-
panion spinning into the flames below

  i exulted over the deed i felt an unholy joy in
having at last wrought vengeance upon this monster

  then the thought of the time i had lost flashed
upon me like an accusation

  in heavens name i cried we must save
edmund and ala

  and juba shouted jack

i turned the car and sped for the platform on
which i knew that they must be

  we saw them but-heaven forgive me-w
were too late

  my vengeance had been purchased at an awful
price a minute earlier we might have saved them
but now they were in the midst of the flames ed-
mund had ala in his arms and juba his long hair
catching the sparks stood resolutely beside them

  edmund saw me and as i live he smiled he
opened his lips but in the awful roar of the fire i
could not hear his voice

  then he raised his hand and seemed to be waving
us off he pointed upward as if commanding us to
go

  ill save them yet i yelled between my set
teeth and rushed the car into the flames

  but at this instant the whole vast structure of the
tower gave way

  it crumbled like a pile of ashes and they were
gone

chapter xxiv

the earth

for a few minutes after this terrible consum-
mation none of us spoke a word henry had
swooned jack stood motionless by my side

  where the tower had been and the leaping flames
had raged was a vast vacuity with wreathes of
smoke rising from far below

  the conflagration was now spreading all over the
splendid city a hundred towers were burning
fiercely on all sides the pointed flames licking the
sky and thousands of planes and air-ships that had
also caught fire were dropping like flaming brands
into the furnace

  the sight filled me at once with pity and with
horror i saw one large plane filled with people
driven in spite of the exertions of its engineers
directly over a burning tower a long spire of
flame reached up and touched it it seemed to
shrivel like a moth in a candle and down it went
with all its living freight

  get away from here cried jack at last recover-
ing his voice

  i turned the car and we sped away

for hours we rushed on not particular to choose
a columbus of space



our direction our only thought was to escape from
this dreadful place at last i slowed down to take
our bearings

  we had left the doomed capital behind the hori-
zon and only the well-known expanse of land be-
neath with a few airplanes sailing about over it
and the cloud-dome above our heads reminded us
that we were still on the planet venus

back to earth

 brought the car to rest and sat down with
jack to consult we looked at each other for a
time in silence then we both burst into tears

  when we recovered ourselves we got out some
provisions and set the little table on which edmund
had served our first morning meal after leaving the
earth we were ravenous with hunger but it was
a sad repast

  henry had to be forced to eat a few mouthfuls
for he was yet out of his head and kept up his
strange mutterings when the meal was finished
jack and i decided upon our course

  there is no reason for staying here another
hour i said we must start at once for the
earth

  but are you sure that you can manage the car
in open space jack eagerly inquired

yes edmund told me everything that needs to
be done and my eyes filled with tears as i spoke

  then let us go said jack solemnly

  we rose swiftly through the cloud-dome and
once more the magnificent spectacle of the great
white globe was before us as rapidly as possible
i accelerated the speed of the car and the huge
planet seemed to sail away into space

  once above the atmosphere the heavens turned
black and the stars sprang out to view there was
the earth again shining brilliantly with the moon
close at her side and i set our course for them

  after a while the indicator showed a speed of
twenty miles a second

  i hardly dare to work it up higher i said but
since venus and the earth are now again in conjunc-
tion the distance we have to travel is only about
twenty-six million miles and we can make it in a
little over eleven and a half days

  and the meteors suggested jack

  we shall have to trust to luck i replied

  oh what a trip that was 

  our hearts were filled with sadness for upon my
word we thought more of edmund and ala and
juba than of the home to which we were returning

  henry added to our trouble for his mind became
every hour more clouded at length he grew vio-
lent in his insanity and sometimes we were obliged
to use force to prevent him from injuring himself

  we had arrived according to my calculations
within a quarter of a million miles of the earth and
already we could begin to see many of its geographi-
cal features when a crisis arose in henrys case

  he had been quiet for a long time and we had
ceased to watch him as carefully as we should have
done when quite unexpectedly he was seized with
a maniacal fit and before a hand could be laid upon
him he had thrown open one of the windows and pre-
cipitated himself out of it

the first death

he leaped with such force that he shot several
yards away from the car i realized in a flash
that he had gone to his death for we could not re-
cover him before his bi-eath would be exhausted it
was necessary instantly to close the window because
the air was rushing out and in a few seconds it
would be all gone and we could not replace it the
apparatus which edmund had provided automati-
cally purified the air in the car and rendered it fit
to be breathed over and over again for an indefinite
time but there was no means of making more air

  already in the few seconds that the window had
remained open the larger part of our supply of air
had escaped and the moment we had slammed the
window back into its air-tight settings jack and i
gasped and sank almost helpless on the floor

  for several minutes we were unable to rise at
last i struggled to my feet and looked out of the
window

  there floated henrys body accompanying us in
our flight

oh jack i said faintly i cannot bear this

  what is it he managed to whisper painfully
lifting himself to the window

  the instant he looked out he dropped back to the
floor with a groan

  the thought of henry following us was too hor-
rible to be entertained desperately i turned a
guiding wheel and the car moved away on a dif-
ferent course but with fascinated eyes i centinued
to watch the body of our friend until a mere speck
it faded into the blackness of the sky

  poor henry he had chosen a strange tomb as
deep as the heavens and as lasting i shuddered at
the thought that there he would continue to float
forever imperishable in germless space unless per-
haps his mother earth should draw him at last
to her bosom when flashing for an instant with
meteoric fire his ashes would be scattered unper-
ceived through the wide atmosphere

  the desperation of the situation in which i now
found myself it is impossible to put into words
jack whose stoutness doubtless served to diminish
his breathing capacity continued lying on the floor
gasping and half asphyxiated i myself was as weak
as a child yet i had to guide the car

the end of jack

without thought of anything but the neces-
sity of reaching the earth or at least of get-
ting within the limits of the atmosphere at the ear-
liest possible moment i recklessly increased the
speed a few minutes time saved might mean life
for jack when i spoke to him he could not reply
but i saw that he was still breathing

  how that car did spin

  before i was aware that we were so near i sud-
denly perceived a vast dark mass filling all the sky
that was visible from the window the earth at
last we were almost there we must be at the
upper limit of the atmosphere and i dared not con-
tinue this speed any longer

i slowed down as rapidly as i could and not a
minute too soon for i could feel heat coming
through the walls of the car and at the same mo-
ment the stout glass in one of the windows cracked

   part ii

what causes the seasons

  in the first place during the diurnal rotation of
jupiter which occupies nine hours fifty-five min-
ute the days are always equal to the nights in all
latitudes that is to say the jovian day is four
hours fifty-seven minutes long and the jovian night
lasts also four hours and fifty-seven minutes

  there said the admirers of jovian existence
you have something suited to people of regular
hahts they will be delighted to submit to such
regularity

  that is what would happen to the earth if bar-
bicane did what he promised only as the new axis
would make no difference in the time of rotation
twenty-four hours would still separate the success-
ive noons and our spheroid would be blessed with
nights and days each twelve hours long and we
would live in a perpetual equinox

  but the climatal phenomena would be much more
curious and no less interesting said the enthusi-
asts would be the absence of the seasons

  owing to the inclina-
tion of the axis to the
plane of the orbit we have
the annual changes known
as spring summer au-
tumn and winter the
jovians could know noth-
ing of these things and
the terrestrians would
know them no more the
moment the new axis be-
came pecpcndicular to the
ecliptic there would be
neither frigid zones nor
torrid zones but the
whole earth would rejoice
in a temperate climate

  why was this

  what is the torrid
zone it is that part of the earth comprised between
the tropics of cancer and capricorn every place
within this zone has the sun in the zenith twice a
year

  what are the temperate zones the part com-
prised between the tropics and the polar circles
between   and   of latitude and in which
the sun never rises to the zenith but is above the
horizon on every day in the year

  what are the frigid zones that part of the cir-
cum-polar regions in which the sun does not rise

abtve the horizon on every day in the year while
at the pole itself he does not rise for six months at a
time

  the height of the sun above the horizon is the
cause of the excessive heat of the torrid zone the
moderate heat of the temperate zone and the exces-
sive cold within the polar circles

  when the axis became perpendicular these things
would be different the sun would remain on the
plane of the equator all the year around he would
pursue his imperturbable twelve-hour course and
rise to a distance from the zenith according to the
latitude of the place in countries of twenty de-
grees of latitude he would rise seventy degrees
above the horizon in countries of forty-nine de-
grees of latitude he would rise forty-one in places
of eighty-four degrees he would rise six and of
ninety degrees the pole he would just peep half
his diameter above the horizon the days would be
perfectly regular and the sun would rise at the
same time and also at the same point on the horizon
throughout the year

  look at the advan-
tages said the friends
of barbicane every
man according to his
temperament can choose
his own climate which
will be invariable
those modern titans
the north pole practical
association were going to
effect a complete change
in the state of things
which had existed ever
since the spheroid had
been launched on its orbit
to become the earth as we
know it

  the astronomer might
lose a few of the familiar
constellations the poet might lose the long winter
nights and the long summer days that figure so fre-
quently in modern verse but what of that when we
think of the advantages that would be enjoyed by
the majority of the human race

  as the newspapers in the barbicane interest
pointed out the products of the earth being reduced
to regularity the farmer could always plant and
sow in the most favorable temperature

  be it so said the opposition but are we to
have no rains or hail or storms or waterspouts or

 in the second and final installment we find our favorite
 author continuing this classic tale in a lighter vein

 human agency evidently our hero mr j t maston

 know because was it not he who successfully made the
 careful calculations of the projectile that took a number
 of travelers on a trip from the earth to the moon and

 mathematics but then on the other hand there arc

            vitriolic alcide

such were the advantages promised by barbi-
canes changing the axi of rotation-a
change however which would only slightly
affect the movement of our spheroid around the
sun the earth would continue to describe its orbit
through space and the conditions of the solar year
would remain the same

  when the consequences of the change of axis
were brought to the knowledge of the world they
caused extraordinary excitement at first this prob-
lem of the higher mechanics received an enthusiastic
welcome the idea of having seasons of constant
equality and according to the latitude to suit
consumers was very attractive the crowd re-
veled in the thought that they could enjoy the per-
petual spring which the bard of telemachus accord-
ed to the island of calypso and that they could have
the spring either fresh or mild where the new axis
was to be seemed to be the secret of barbicane
nicholl and j t maston which they were in no
hurry to present to the public would they reveal it
in advance or would it be known after the experi-
ment it would be as well to say so perhaps as
opinion began to show signs of anxiety in the mat-
ter	

  one observation ocurred naturally to the mind
and was at once commented on in the newspapers
by what mechanical means was the change to be
produced which evidently required the employment
of an enormous force

  the forum an important new york review very
justly remarked if the earth did not turn on its
axis it is probable that a relatively feeble shock
would suffice to give a movement of rotation around
an axis arbitrarily chosen but the earth is like an
enormous gyroscope moving at high velocity and
it is a natural law that such an apparatus has a
tendency to turn around the same axis as foucault

demonstrated in his well-known experiments it
will therefore be very difficult if not impossible to
shift it

  but after asking what would be the effort re-
quired by the engineers of the north polar practi-
cal association it was at least as interesting to
know if the effort was to be suddenly or insensibly
applied and if it was to be a sudden effort would
not the proceedings of messrs barbicane  co pro-
duce some rather alarming catastrophies on the face
of the earth

a new character appears

here was something to occupy the brains of the
wise and foolish a shock is a shock and it is
never agreeable to receive the blow or the counter-
blow there was a likelihood that the promoters of
the enterprise had been so busy with the advantages
the world was to possess that they had overlooked
the destruction the operation would entail and
with considerable cleverness the major and his allies
made the most of this and began to agitate public
opinion against the president of the gun club

  although france had taken bo part in the syndi-
cating and officially treated the matter with disdain
yet there was in that country an individual who con-
ceived the idea of setting out for baltimore to fol-
low for his own private satisfaction the different
phases of the enterprise

  he was a mining engineer of about five and thirty
year of age he had been the first on the list when
admitted to the polytechnic school and he had been
the first on the list when he left it so that he must
have been a mathematician of the first order and
probably superior to j t maston who though he
was a long way above the average was only a cal-
culator after all-that is to say what leverrier was
compared to newton or laplace

  this engineer was a man of brains and-though
he was none the worse for that-somewhat of a
humorist and an original in conversation with his
intimates even when he talked science his language
was more that of the slang of the streets than of the
academical formulas he employed when he wrote he
was a wonderful worker being accustomed to sit
for ten hours at a stretch before his table writing
pages on pages of algebra with as much ease as he
would have written a letter

  this singular man was called pierdeux alcide
and in his way of condensing it-as is the custom
of his comrades-he generally signed himself
apierd or even ap  without even dotting the i
he was so perfervid in his discussions that he had
been named vitriolic alcide not only was he big
but he was tall his friends affirmed that his height
was exactly the five millionth part of a quarter of
the meridian and they were not far out although
bis head was rather too small for his powerful bust
and shoulders yet he held it well and piercing were
the eyes that looked through his pince-nez he was
chiefly distiguished by one of those physiognomies
in which gaiety and gravity intermingle and his
hair had been prematurely thinned by the abuse of
algebraic signs under the light of the gas-lamps in
the study

  he was one of the best fellows whose memory
lingers at the school although his character was
independent enough he was always loyal to the re-
the purchase of the north pole



quirements of code x which is law among the poly-
technicians in all that concerns comradeship and re-
spect for the uniform he was equally appreciated
under the trees of the court of acas so named
because there are no acacias as in the casers the
dormitories in which the arrangements of his box
and the order that reigned in his coffin denoted
an absolutely methodical mind

  that the head of alcide pierdeux was a little too
small for his body we admit but that it was filled to
the meninges will be believed above all things he
was a mathematician as all his comrades are or
have been but he only used his mathematics in ap-
plication to experimental science whose chief at-
traction to him was that it had much to do with in-
dustry herein he recognized the inferior side of
his nature no one is perfect his strong point was
the study of those sciences which notwithstanding
their immense progress have and always will have
secrets for their followers

  alcide was still a bachelor he was still equal
to one as he phrased it although he had no ob-
jection to become the half of two his friends had
had ideas of marrying him to a very charming girl
at martigues but unfortunately she had a father
who responded to the first overtures in the follow-
ing martigalade no your alcide is too clever
he talks to my poor girl in a way that is unintell-
igible to her

  and hence alcide resolved to take a years holiday
and thought he could not employ his time better than
in following the north polar practical association
in its peculiar undertaking

  as soon as he arrived at baltimore he began to
think over the matter seriously that the earth
would become jovian by the change of its axis mat-
tered very little to him but by what means it was
to be brought about excited his curiosity and not
without reason

a frenchman in baltimore

in his picturesque language he said to himself
evidently barbicane is going to give our ball a
terrible knock but what sort of a knock every-
thing depends on that i suppose he is going to play
for side as if with a cue at a billiard-ball but if he
hits us square he may jolt us out of our orbit and
then the years will dance to a pretty tune they are
going to shift the old axis for a new one probably
above it but i do not see where they are to get their
taking-off place from or how they are to manage the
knock if there was no rotation a mere flip would
suffice but they cant put down that diurnal spin
that is the canisdentum

  he meant the rub but that was his way of ex-
pressing himself

  whatever they do he continued there will be
no end of a row before it is over

  try all he could the engineer could not discover
barbicanes plan which for one reason was much to
be regretted as if it had been known to him he would
at once have made the calculations he needed

  but all at present was a mystery and so it hap-
pened that on the th of december alcide pierdeux
ingtnieur au corps national des mines de france
was hurrying with lengthy strides through the
crowded streets of baltimore

chapter x
a change in public opinion

a month had elapsed since the meeting in
rooms of the gun club and a change had
taken place in public opinion

  the advantages of altering the axis of rotation
were being forgotten and the disadvantages were
being enlarged upon it was impossible that a
catastrophe could be avoided for any change must
necessarily be occasioned by a violent shock what
the catastrophe would be no one could say was
this amelioration of climate desirable who would
gain by it except the eskimos laps and samoyeds
who had nothing to lose

  the major and his allies were indefatigable in
their prophecies of evil

  it is evident said karkof that the projectors
will do all they can to protect the united states from
the consequences of tho shock

  but can they asked harald when you shake
a tree all the branches shake

  and said the dutchman when you are hit in
the stomach does not your whole body shake
that is what that famous clause meant said
todrin here are the geographical and meteoro-
logical modifications

  yes said baldenak but suppose the change of
axis throws the seas out of their existing basins
and if the ocean level is lowered at different
points said jansen some people may find them-
selves so high up in the world that communication
with them will be impossible

  if they go up too high they will not be able to
breathe said harald

  would you like to see baltimore as high as
mont blanc asked donellan

  this modification of the axis was evidently a pub-
lic danger a change of   would produce a
considerable displacement in the seas owing to the
flattening at the poles the earth was thus threat-
ened with similar disasters to those that it is be-
lieved have recently occurred in mars there en-
tire continents among others libya and schia-
parelli have been submerged as shown by the
faint blue replacing the faint red lake moeris has
disappeared north and south there have been
changes and the oceans have withdrawn from many
localties they formerly occupied if a few charita-
ble souls have been much affected at the floods in
mars-almost as much as to open subscriptions for
the sufferers-what would they do for the floods
on the earth

  protests came in by every post the united
states government was urged to interfere

  look as these yankees said one they want
to hang the globe on another axletree as if the
old one after all these centuries had worn out
but is it not as sound as it was at the beginning
and there was vitriolic alcide at work trying to
find out the nature and direction of the shock that
j t maston had arranged once master of the
secret he would very soon know what parts of the
earth were in danger

the contents of the note-book

it was not likely that the united states would
suffer barbicane  co were quite yankees


amazing stories

enough to take care of their own country evidently
the new continent between the arctic sea and the
gulf of mexico had nothing to fear it was even
possible that north america would gain a con-
siderable accession of territory

  that may be said the nervous people who only
saw the perilous side of things but are you
sure supposing j t maston has made a mistake
supposing barbicane makes a mistake when he puts
mastons theory in practice such a thing can
happen to the cleverest artillerists they do not
always score a bulls-eye

  these fears were sedulously worked upon by the
major and the opposition todrin published a num-
ber of articles in a leading canadian newspaper
harald rushed into print in a swedish journal
colonel boris karkof tried his hand in a russian
one the americans began to take sides the new
york tribune and the boston journal took up their
parable against barbicane in vain the north po-
lar practical association tried to stem the rising
tide in vain mrs scorbitt paid ten dollars a line
for serious articles humorous articles and smart
scathing paragraphs treating the dangers as chimer-
ical in vain the enthusiastic widow endeavored to
show that if ever hypothesis was unjustifiable it
was that which assumed that j t maston was
capable of an error

  neither barbicane nor his co-directors took the
trouble to say anything they let the talk go on
without making any change in their habits they
seemed to be thoroughly absorbed in the immense
preparations necessitated by their undertaking the
revulsion of public opinion seemed to concern them
not in the least

  but in spite of all mrs scorbitt could do it soon
came about that impey barbicane captain nicholl
and j t maston began to be looked upon as dan-
gers to society so high grew the clamor that the
federal government had to interfere and call upon
them to declare their intentions what were their
means of action how did they intend to substitute
one axis for another what would be the conse-
quences of the substitution what parts of the
globe would the substitution endanger

  the excitement raging in every state in the
union allowed of no hesitation on the part of the
washington government a commission of in-
quiry composed of engineers mathematicians hy-
drographers and geographers to the number of
fifty presided over by the celebrated john prestice
was appointed on the th of february with full
power to investigate the affair and put a stop to it
if necessary

  impey barbicane was requested to attend before
the commission barbicane did not come

  the police went to look for him at his residence
 cleveland street baltimore barbicane was
there no longer

  where was he they did not know

  when had he gone away five weeks ago on
the th of january he had left maryland in com-
pany with captain nicholl

  where had they gone no one could say

  evidently the two members of the gun club
were on their way to the mysterious region where
preparations would begin under their direction

  but where could that be

  it was important to know if the scheme of
these dangerous projectors was to be nipped in the
bud

   the effect of this departure of barbicane and
nicholl was immense the popular wrath rose like
the rising of the equinoctial tide against the north
polar practical association

   but there was one man who ought to know what
had become of barbicane and his colleague there
was one who ought to be able to reply and instantly
j t maston

   j t maston was requested to appear before the
 commission he did not go

   hed he then left baltimore had he gone with his
 colleagues to help in the work of which the world
 awaited the results with such very natural alarm

   no j t maston was still to be found at ballis-
 tic cottage he was still incessantly at work but
 now on other calculations which he only left to
 spend an occasional evening with mrs scorbitt at
 new park

  a policeman was sent with an order from the
president of the commission the policeman
reached the cottage knocked at the door entered
the hall and had a warm reception from fire-fire
and a cool one from j t maston

   however the secretary of the gun club thought
it as well to go quietly and he appeared before the
commission complaining bitterly of having been
interrupted in his occupation

   the first question put to him was do you know
 the whereabouts of impey barbicane and captain
 nicholl

   i do said j t maston but i am not au-
thorized to tell you

   second question are these two men occupied in
 the preparations for their intended modification of
 the terrestrial axis

   that said j t maston is part of the secret
 with which i am entrusted and i refuse to say

   would he submit his calculations to the commis-
 sion that they might judge if the project of the
 association could be accomplished

   no certainly not said j t maston it is
my right as a free american citizen to keep from
anybody the result of my work

   but if that is your right mr maston said
president prestice solemnly as if he spoke in the
name of the entire world it may be your duty
to speak in face of the anxiety that exists

heroic silence

jt maston did not think it was his duty he

	had only one duty-to keep silent and he
would keep silent

   in spite of their persistence their supplications
 their threats the members of the commission of
 inquiry could get nothing out of the man with the
 iron hook never would they have believed that so
 much obstinacy lurked within a gutta-percha cran-
 ium j t maston left as he had arrived and that
 he was congratulated on his valiant defense by mrs
 scorbitt we need hardly say

   when the result of j t mastons appearance was
 made known public opinion took a form that was
 jeally serious for his safety the pressure on the
 government became so great that secretary john s
the purchase of the north pole



wright had to obtain permission from the president
to act maim militari

  on the evening of the th of march j t mas-
ton was in his workroom at ballistic cottage ab-
sorbed in his algebra when the bell of the telephone
tinkled nervously

  hallo there hallo there murmured the in-
strument in a way that showed great anxiety

  whos there asked j t maston

  mrs scorbitt

  what is it

  be on your guard i have just heard that this
very night-

  the sentence had not been finished when the door
of ballistic cottage was burst open by a push from
several shoulders and up the staircase came an ex-
traordinary tumult there was a voice protesting
then other voices silencing it then a bump as of a
fallen body-bump bump-it was the negro fire-
fire rolling downstairs after an unavailing de-
fense of his masters home-bump bump the door
of the workroom flew open policemen rushed in the
excitable maston seized a revolver instantly he
was disarmed a policeman laid his hand on the
papers on the desk maston slipped free and dashed
at a note-book the police were after him before
they could reach him he had torn out the last leaf
clipped it to his mouth and gulped it down as if it
had been a pill

  now said he in the tone of a leonidas at ther-
mopylse now you can do your duty

  an hour afterward he was in the jail at balti-
more

  and that was probably the best thing that could
have happened to him for the populace were in such
a state of excitement that the police might have
found themselves powerless to protect him

chapter xi

the contents of the notebook

the book seized by the baltimore police con-
tained thirty pages sprinkled with formulse
multiplications equations and finally the gen-
eral results of j t mastons calculation it was
a work of the higher mechanics appreciable only by
mathematicians one of the equations was the-

of which we heard in the moon voyage

  the general reader could make neither head
nor tail of mastons performances but they could
understand the results as told to the newspapers a
few days later

  there was nothing wrong with j t mastons
working the commission reported the calcula-
tions had been made with such precision that the
commission had no doubt as to their accuracy and
consequences if the operation was effected the ter-
restrial axis would be undoubtedly changed and
then the catastrophes foreseen would be accom-
plished in all their plentitude

  the object said the official communication to
the newspapers of the directorate of the north
polar practical association is the substitution of si
new axis of rotation for the old one and it is pro-

posed to attain this object by means of the recoil
of an apparatus fixed in some agreed point of the
earths circumference if the core of this appa-
ratus is firmly fixed in the ground there can be no
doubt but that it would communicate its recoil to
the mass of our planet

  the apparatus adopted by the association is a
monster cannon which would have no effect if dis-
charged vertically to produce the maximum effect
it must be aimed horizontally toward the north or
south and it is this latter direction which has been
decided on by the association in this way the re-
coil will produce a shock toward the north of the
nature of that given to a billiard-ball when struck
on the side

  exactly as alcide had foreseen

  as soon as the explosion takes place the center
of the earth will be displaced in a direction parallel
to that of the impetus and a change will ensue in
the plane of the orbit and consequently in the length
of the year but this will be so slight as to be of
no appreciable amount at the same time the earth
would take a movement of rotation around an axis
supposing that no rotation existed previous to the
shock but as the rotation in the line of the poles
already exists it will combine with the accessory ro-
tation produced by the recoil and result in a new
axis if the gun is fired at the moment when the
equator and the ecliptic are in intersection and
if the recoil is enough to displace the pole  
then the new axis will become perpendicular to the
plane of the orbit

  the consequences of this perpendicularity were
clearly stated by impey barbicane at the meeting
on the nd of december

  given the mass of the earth and the amount of
movement it possesses can a gun be produced hav-
ing a recoil sufficient to produce such a displace-
ment of the pole as  

  undoubtedly if a gun or series of guns be con-
structed in accordance with the laws of mechanics
or if the inventors possess an explosive of the neces-
sary power such an explosive they unfortunately
possess it was discovered by captain nicholl its
name is meli-melonite but all that is known of it is
that it is a mixture of organic substances with ni-
tric acid a certain number of monatomic radicals
are substituted for the same number of atoms of
hydrogen and a powder is obtained which like gun-
cotton is formed by combination not by me-
chanical mixture of the principal comburents and
combustibles

a truly epic reply

uttthatever this explosive may be the force

   vv it possesses is sufficient to carry a projectile
weighing  tons beyond the terrestrial attrac-
tion and it is hoped by the association that the re-
coil will have the effect of displacing the pole and
forming a new axis perpendicular to the plane of
the ecliptic from which would result the catas-
trophes which have alarmed the inhabitants of the
earth

  there is a chance that humanity may yet escape
the consequences of an operation which would bring
about such regrettable geographical and meteoro-
logical changes in the surface of the globe is it
possible to construct a cannon of the dimensions


amazing stories

required we are of opinion that it is very doubt-
ful if it can be done

  it is well known that the two chief directors of
the north polar practical association have left
baltimore and america probably for the purpose of
attempting the manufacture of this cannon in some
distant part of the world

  where they have gone to is unknown and con-
sequently it is impossible to secure the malefactors
who would upset the world under pretense of open-
ing up new coal-fields

  evidently the place was indicated on the last
page of the note-book captured by the police from
j t maston but this last page had disappeared
having been swallowed by the said j t maston
now in prison at baltimore

  such is the position if impey barbicane can
make his cannon and his projectile he will change
the earths axis and within the next six months the
earth will be subjected to his reckless assault

  a date has been chosen for the discharge of the
projectile the date on which the shock would have
its maximum of effect on the terrestrial spheroid

  this date is the nd of september twelve hours
after the passage of the sun across the meridian
of the place x

  this place it is impossible from the calculations
to discover

  there is nothing in j t mastons note-book to
show the position of the new axis

  it is therefore impossible to state what terri-
tories or seas will be affected by the attempt

  the difference of level will be considerable
after the shock the surface of the sea will take the
form of an ellipsoid of revolution and the level will
change nearly all over the globe

  in fact the intersection of the level of the old
sea with the level of the new sea of two equal
surfaces of revolution with the axes intersecting
will be of two curved planes and the maxima of ele-
vation or abasement will exceed  feet

  it is worthy of remark that the ancient pole will
be immersed under more than  feet of water so
that the district acquired by the north polar prac-
tical association will be flooded unless there exists
at the pole a plateau of more than that number
of feet of elevation

  where the maximum of alteration of land will
take place is unknown there is in the equation
an unknown quantity which no known formula can
evaluate this unknown is the position of x where
the shock is to be applied this x is the secret of
the promoters of this deplorable affair

  in conclusion it is desirable to point out that
all the inhabitants of the earth are interested
in unraveling the secret for all are menaced by the
proceedings of the association

  notice is therefore given to the inhabitants of
all parts of the world to keep a strict watch over
all operations regarding the founding of cannons
or the fabrication of powders or projectiles taking
place on their territories and to report the appear-
ance of any stranger connected therewith to the
commission of inquiry at baltimore u s a

  it is urgently necessary that the information
should reach the commission before the nd of
september next the date on which the established

order of the terrestrial system is so seriously
menaced

chapter xii
heroic silence

it was a cannon that hurled the projectile up to
the moon it was to be a cannon that was to
change the terrestrial axis the cannon al-
ways the cannon barbicane and co evidently suf-
fered from chronic attacks of aggravated cannon-
ism was a cannon the ultima ratio of the world
was it to be the brutal sovereign of the universe
the canon rules theology was the cannon to give
the law to commerce and cosmology

  a cannon was the engine barbicane  co were
to bring into action they had not devoted their
lives to ballistics for nothing after the columbiad
of tampa town there was to come the monster can-
non of-of-the place of x and already there
were people who could hear the sonorous command
no  aim at the moon fire

  no  change the earths axis firel

  and then for the general upset predicted by
vitrolic alcide

  the publication of the report of the commission
produced an effect of which it is impossible even to
give an idea there was nothing in it of a soothing
tendency it must be admitted by j t mastons
calculations the problem had evidently been solved
the operation to be attempted by barbicane  co
would it was only too clear introduce a most re-
grettable modification in the dkirnal movement
a new axis would be substituted for the old and
we know what would be the consequences of that
substitution

  the enterprise of barbicane  co was thus
judged cursed and demitted to general reprobation
barbicane  co were dangers to society if they
retained a few partisans in the united states they
were few indeed

interesting for the inhabitants of the terrestrial
spheroid

from the point of view of their own personal
safety impey barbicane and captain nicholl
had certainly done wisely to clear out they would
assuredly have come to grief if they had not done
so it was not with impunity that they could men-
ace fourteen hundred millions of people upset their
habits and customs and disturb their very existence
by provoking a general catastrophe

  but how had these two men managed to dis-
appear without leaving a trace how could they
have gotten away unperceived with the men and
material necessary for their project hundreds of
wagons if they went by railway and hundreds of
ships if they went by sea would be required for
the transport of the metal the fuel and the meli-
melonite it was quite incomprehensible how the
departure could have taken place incognito but it
had taken place nevertheless

  inquiries were made but nothing was discovered
as to any order being sent to any of the metallur-
gical or chemical works of the world it was in-
explicable but the explanation would come-some
day

  barbicane and nicholl having mysteriously dis-
the purchase of the north pole

appeared were beyond immediate danger but 
t maston he was under lock and key but were
not public reprisals to be feared  bah he did not
trouble himself about that in the least admirably
obstinate was the calculator he was of iron-like
bis fore-arm at nothing did he quail

   from the depths of his cell in the jail of baltimore
the secretary of the gun club became more and more
absorbed in the distant contemplation of the col-
leagues he had not accompanied in his minds
eye he could see barbicane and nicholl preparing
their gigantic enterprise in that unknown region
where no one could interefere with them he saw
them making the cannon mixing the meli-melonite
casting the projectile which the sun would soon
count among its minor asteroids that new star
which was to bear the name of scorbitta as a deli-
cate compliment to the millionaire of new park
j t maston began to count the days that would
elapse before the word to fire was given

  it was the month of april in two months and
a half the sun would halt at the solstice on the
tropic of cancer and retrograde toward the tropic
of capricorn three months later he would cross
the equator at the autumnal equinox and with
that would finish the seasons that for millions of
ages had alternated with such regularity in every
terrestrial year for the last time the spheroid
would submit to the inequality of its days and
nights for the future the number of hours be-
tween sunrise and sunset would be equal all over
the globe

   in truth it was a magnificent work j t maston
forgot all about the polar coal-field in contemplat-
ing the cosmographical consequences of his labors
the principal object of the association had been
forgotten in the transformations the face of the
earth would undergo-notwithstanding that the
earth did not care about these magnificent transfor-
mations

   j t maston alone and defenseless in his cell
resisted every pressure brought to bear on him the
members of the commission of inquiry visited him
daily and obtained nothing it occurred at last to
john prestice to make use of an influence that
might succeed better than his-that of mrs scor-
bitt no one was ignorant of the lengths to which
the widow would go when the celebrated calculator
was in peril

  there was a meeting of the commission and
mrs scorbitt was authorized to visit the prisoner
as often as she thought fit was not she threatened
with the danger from the recoil of the monster
cannon as much as any other of the worlds in-
habitants would her new park mansion escape
the final catastrophe any more than the wigwam
of the poor indian or the humble hut of the back-
woodsman was not hsr life as much in danger
as that of the obscurest samoyed or south sea
islander the president of the commission ela-
borately explained this to her and suggested that
she should bring her influence to bear for the
geneial good

   if she could only get j t maston to state where
barbicane and nicholl had gone there would still
be time to pursue them and save humanity from the
impending fate



a mathematician in jail

 and so mrs scorbitt had access to the jail
 -i- what she desired above all was to see j t
 maston who had been torn by the police from the
 comfrts of this cottage let it not be supposed that
 the heroic evangelina was a slave to human weak-
 ness and if on the th of april some indiscreet
 ear had been applied to the keyhole the first time
 that the widow appeared in the cell this is what
 would have met it

at last dear maston i see you again

 you mrs scorbitt

 yes my friend after four weeks four long
 weeks of separation-

 exactly twenty-eight days flve hours forty-five
 minutes said maston looking at his watch

 at last we meet

 but why mrs scorbitt why have they allowed
 you to come here

 to use whatever influence a boundless admira-
 tion may have on him who is its object

 what exclaimed j t maston you have con-
 sented to talk thus to me you have imagined that

 i	would betray my colleagues

 do you think so meanly of me i to ask you to
 sacrifice your safety to your honor i to urge you
 to an act which would be the disgrace of a life con-
 secrated to the highest speculations of the higher
 mechanics

 bravo mrs scorbitt i recognize the worthy
 shareholder of our association never did i doubt
 your courage

 thank you dear maston

 as for me to divulge our work to reveal at
 what spot on the surface of the earth our effort is
 to be made to sell the secret i fortunately kept
 hidden within me to permit these barbarians to
 launch off in pursuit of our friends to interrupt
 the labors they are engaged in for our profit and
 our glory i would rather die first

maston you are sublime said evangelina

 in truth these two beings so closely united in
 enthusiasm-and equally mad-were born to under-
 stand each other

 no continued maston never shall they know
 the name of the country which my calculations have
 designated and which will become immortal they
 may kill me if they will but they shall never pos-
 sess my secret

 and they may kill me with you said mrs scor-
 bitt for i also will be dumb

 fortunately they do not know that you possess
 the secret

 do you think i am capable of revealing it be-
 cause i am only a woman  to betray our colleagues
 and you no my friend no the philistines may
 raise the world against you to tear you from your
 cell but i will be with you and we shall have at
 least the consolation of dying together

 and that was the way the conversatfon ended
 every time the widow visited the prisoner and
 every time the commissioners inquired as to the re-
 sult the answer was the same

 nothing yet but in time i hope to obtain what
 you want i

 gh the astuteness of woman

in time she said but time marched on week


amazing stories

went by like days days like hours hours like
minutes

  it was now may mrs scorbitt had obtained
nothing and if she failed who could hope to suc-
ceed was the world to resign itself to this
terrible blow without a chance of hindering it

the chorus of terror

ttell no in such things resignation is un-

  w acceptable our friends the delegates were
unceasing in fomenting the excitement jansen
overwhelmed the commissioners daily karkoff
picked a quarrel with the secretary donellan to
make things worse directed attention to another
victim in the shape of the codfish merchant fors-
ter who had sunk into insignificance after the
auction sale to bid at which he had been engaged
and in order to bring the phlegmatic fishmonger
prominently to the front the canadian attempted
to knock him down to complicate matters further
the friendly powers began to bring pressure to
bear on the washington government which had
quite enough to do to withstand the pressure of
its own people in reply the washington govern-
ment issued a circular authorizing the arrest of
the two malefactors by any power whatsoever
but none the less did it remain impossible to dis-
cover where the malefactors had gone

  then the powers hinted that if j t maston
were properly dealt with j t maston would re-
veal the secret but the government might as
well have tried to extract a word from harpocrates
the god of silence or from the chief deaf-mute of
the new york institute

  and then the exasperation increased with the
general anxiety and a few practical minds drew
attention to the fact that the torture system of the
middle ages was not without some advantages
so it was proposed to introduce for the benefit of
j t maston a few experiments with the boot
the scavengers daughter molten lead boiling
oil the wooden horse the bastinado etc etc
but such things were impossible in the century
which invented the magazine rifle roburite bellite
panclastite and other ites not to mention the
far superior meli-melonite

  j t maston had then no fear of being put to
the torture all that could be done with him was
to hope that he would speak or that chance would
speak for him

chapter xiii
a truly epic reply

time advanced and so probably did the works
of barbicane  co but where was the
mystery

  but if their works were to require a foundry
capable of casting a gun a million times larger
than a four-hundred pounder and a projectile
weighing one hundred and eighty thousand tons
they would want thousands of workmen and where
oh where could they be

  in what part of the old or new world had bar-
bicane  co installed themselves so secretly as to
be invisible to the nations around  had they gone
to some desert island of the pacific but there are

  bo desert islands now that they had gone to the
arctic or antarctic regions was extremely unlikely
for those were the very regions they intended to
displace

  there was no need to look for them all over the
world for j t mastons note-book had revealed the
fact that the shot must be fired from near the
equator along the equinoctial line they might
be in brazil or peru or sumatra or borneo or
celebes or new guinea but surely they would have
been discovered by the people in the neighborhood
all through africa too they would be almost cer-
tain of discovery there remained the maldive
islands the admiralty gilbert and christmas is-
lands the galapagos and san pedro islands but
all these had been searched and no trace of barbi-
cane  co had been found

  and what did alcide pierdeux think of all this
more sulphuric than ever he knew no rest in
considering the different consequences of the prob-
lem that captain nicholl had invented an explo-
sive of such power that its expansion was three
or four thousand times greater than the most
violent explosives used in modern war and five
thousand six hundred times stronger than good
old gun-powder was he remarked etonnant not
to say dttonmnt but it was not impossible no
one knows what the future has in store for us in
that kind of progress in the shifting of the earths
axis by means of the recoil of a gun there was
nothing to surprise him

  it is evident he said to himself that every
day the earth receives the counter-shock from
every shock produced on its surface it is certain
that when hundreds of thousands of men amuse
themselves by sending thousands of projectiles
weighing pounds or millions weighing ounces even
when i walk or jump or when i stretch out my arm
or when a blood corpuscle circulates in my veins
it must in some way influence the mass of our
spheroid but in the name of an integral will bar-
bicanes jolt be sufficient to upset the earth if
the equations of that brute maston really demon-
strate that we must make up our minds to it

a great mathematician

in truth alcide could not but admire the ingeni-
ous calculations of the secretary of the gun
club communicated by the commission of inquiry
to the mathematicians who could understand them
and alcide who read algebra as if it were a news-
paper found the study of them extremely interest-
ing

  but if the upset did come what a dreadful state
of affairs there would be in the world what cities
thrown down what mountains shaken what people
destroyed by millions what waters hurled from
their beds what fearful terrors it would be such
an earthquake as had never quaked before

   if nicholls powder he said was not quite so
 strong the projectile might return t give the
 earth another shock either before or behind the
 firing-point after making the turn of the globe
 and then everything might soon be knocked back
 into place after causing immense destruction
 nevertheless but they are going to throw it over-
 board thanks to their meli-melonite thir shell
 will describe the half of a hyperbola and never come
the purchase of the north pole

   back to beg pardon for having given that kick to
the terrestrial ball

   and alcide threw his arms about like the sema-
phore at portsmouth dockyard at the risk of break-
ing everything within a radius of six feet of him

   if the firing-point were known i could soon find
 the great circles in which the alteration will be zero
 and the places where it will reach the maximum so
 as to give folks notice to clear out and save them-
 selves from being smashed by their houses tumbling
 about their ears but how am i to know that
 firing-point

   and he ran his fingers through the very little
hair that had been left him

   the results of the shock may be much more
complicated than they imagine why should not
the volcanoes take the opportunity to favor us with
a few disorderly eruptions and like a first voyager
displace some of the matter in their insides why
should not the uplifted ocean take a header into
some of the craters theres a chance for you
that would give an explosion that might send the
whole tellurian box of tricks sky high or rather
sky higher what do you say to that you con-
founded maston you obstinate mute what do
you mean by juggling with our poor earth as if it
were a ball on a billiard table

   these alarming hypotheses of vitriolic alcide
were taken up and discussed by the newspapers all
over the world the pyrotechnic display organized
by barbicane  co would end in waterspouts tidal
waves deluges would it but such catastrophes
would only be partial thousands of people would
disappear and the rest would hardly notice any-
thing worth mentioning as the fatal day ap-
proached fear came over the bravest it might
have been the dreadful year  from the way in
which the people generally conducted themselves

   what happened in that year  it may be inter-
 esting to recall owing to a passage in the apo-
 calypse the people of europe were persuaded that
 the day of judgement was nigh they waited for
 the signs of wrath the son of perdition antichrist
 was to be revealed

   in the last year of the tenth century relates

h	martin everything was interrupted-pleasures
business interest even the work in the fields
why said the people should we provide for a
future that will never come let us think of eter-
nity which will begin tomorrow they provided
only for their immediate needs they handed over
their lands and castles to the monasteries to obtain
their protection in the kingdom in the skies which
was about to come to them many of the deeds of
gift to the churches begin with the words the
end of the world approaching and its ruin being
imminent when the end of the fetal terra arrived
the people kept within the basilicas the chapels the
edifices consecrated to god and waited in agony
for the seven trumpets of the seven angels of
judgment to sound in the sky

as we know new years day  was reached
without any disturbance in the laws of nature
but this time the expectation of the catastrophe
was not based on a doubtful interpretation of a
text it was a change to be applied to the earths
equilibrium based on indisputable calculations
which the progress of the ballistic and mechanical

 sciences rendered quite possible this time it was
 not the sea that would give back the dead but the
 sea that would engulf millions of the living

   under these circumstances the position of j t
 maston became daily more critical mrs scorbitt
 trembled lest he should become the victim of the
 general mania sometimes she thought of advising
 him to speak the word which he so obstinately kept
 to himself but she dared not and she did well
 it would have been to expose herself to a categorical
 refusal

   the city of baltimore was a prey to terror and
 it became difficult to restrain the populace who
 were being excited even unto madness by the news-
 papers by the telegrams which they published from
 the four angles of the earth to use the apocalyptic
 language of st john the evangelist in the days of
 domitian assuredly if j t maston had lived
 under that persecuting emperor his business would
 soon have been settled he would have been thrown
 to the beasts but he would have contented himself
 with replying

   i am there already

   bat no matter what happened he refused to re-
veal the position of place x knowing well that if he
divulged it barbicane and nicholl would be pre-
vented from continuing their work

one man against the world

a fter all there was something grand in this
struggle between one man and the entire world
j t maston increased in grandeur in the mind of
mrs scorbitt and also in the opinion of his col-
leagues of the gun club these gallant fellows
were as obstinate as retired artillery men and never
swerved from their support of barbicane  co
the secretary of the gun club reached such a
height of celebrity that a number of persons even
wrote to him as they do to famous criminals to
obtain a few lines from the hand of the man
who was going to upset the globe

   this was all very fine but it was more and more
 dangerous the populace thronged day and night
 around the jail of baltimore there was great
 shouting and much tumult the mob would have
 lynched j t maston there and then if they could
 and the police saw the time was coming when they
 could no longer protect him

   desirous of satisfying the american mob as well
 as the mob of other countries the washington
 government decided to bring j t maston to trial

   with a jury selected from the terrified masses
 the affair would not hang about long to quote the
 words of alcide who felt a kind of sympathy for the
 calculators tenacity

   on the th of september the president of the
commission visited the prisoner in his cell

   mrs scorbitt at his urgent request was allowed
 to accompany him perhaps at the last attempt
 the influence of this amiable lady might be success-
 ful it would not do to neglect anything all
 means were legitimate that might secure the word
 of the enigma if they did not succeed they would
 see

   they will see said the knowing ones sup-
pose they hang j t maston and the catastrophe
takes place all the same

   at eleven oclock then maston found himself in


amazing stories

 the presence of john prestice and evangelina scor-
 bitt

 for the last time said prestice will yon
 answer me

 what about said maston

 where has your colleague barbicane gone to
 i have already told you a hundred times
 repeat it for the hundred and first

 he has gone where he will fire the cannon

 and where will he fire the cannon

 where barbicane is at this present moment
 take care maston

 of what

 of the consequences of your refusal to reply
 the result will be-

 that you will not discover what you have no
 right to know

 what we have the right to know

 that is not my opinion

 we are going to put you on your trial

 you can put me on my trial

 and the jury will find you guilty

 let them find me guilty

 and the sentence will immediately be given and
 immediately executed
 r very well

 dear maston said evangelina whose heart
 trembled at the prospect

 oh mrs scorbitt said j t maston

 she bowed her head and was silent

 would you like to know what the sentence will
 be-

 yes if you like

 you will be hanged as you deserve

 really

 and you will be hanged sir as sure as two and
 two make four

 the difference between a theorem and a definition

 rphen sir i shall have a chance said the
  phlegmatic maston if you were only the
 least bit of a mathematician you would not say as
 sure as two and two make four what is it that
 proves that all mathematicians up to now have not
 been mad in asserting that the sum of two numbers
 is equal to that of their parts that two and two
 make exactly four

 sir exclaimed the president completely puz-
 zled

 ah continued maston if you had said as
 sure as one and one make two all right that is
 absolutely evident for it is no longer a theorem
 it is a definition

 at this lesson in arithmetic the president of the
 commission retired while mrs scorbitts eyes were
 ablaze with admiration for the extraordinary abili-
 ties of her beloved calculator

chapter xiv

the geographical value of x

 fortunately for j t maston the federal
 government unexpectedly received the fol-
 lowing telegram

 to john s wright washington u s a
 zanzibar th september  a m local time
 great foundries have been established among the
 wamasai to the south of kilimanjaro for eight

months impey barbicane and nicholl have been
there with hundreds of black workmen under the
authority of the sultan bali-bali information for
government purposes-richard w trust u s
consul

  and that is how the great secret was discovered
and that is why the secretary of the gun club was
not hanged

  but who can say that he did not live to regret
that he was not removed from mankind in all the
plenitude of his glory

  anyhow the fact of the discovery is so important
in our history that we shall only be treating it with
due respect in giving it this chapter to itself

chapter xv

interesting for the inhabitants of the terrestrial
spheroid

and so the washington government knew
barbican  co had commenced business
there could be no doubt as to the authenti-
city of the telegram the consul of zanzibar was
too cautious a man for his information to be
doubted and it was confirmed by subsequent tele-
grams the gigantic works of the north polar
practical association were in full swing in the
center of the kilimanjaro region about three hun-
dred miles from the east coast of africa a little
below the equinoctial line

  how had they come to be installed so secretly
in this lost country at the foot of the famous
mountain discovered in  by krapf and reb-
mann how had barbicane  co been able to
build their foundries and collect their staff by
what means had they managed to enter into peaceful
relations with the savage tribes of the districts and
their cruel and grasping chiefs nobody knew
and as there were only a few days to run before
the nd it was not unlikely that nobody would
know

  when j t maston learned from evangelina that
the mystery of kilimanjaro had been cleared up by
a telegram from zanzibar-

  pshaw he said making a wonderful zigzag
in the air with his iron hook they do not travel
yet by telegraph or telephone and in six days-
patarapatanboom-boom-all will be ready

  and any one who heard the secretary of the gun
club deliver the sonorous onomatope like a roar
from a columbiad would have wondered at the
amount of vital energy remaining in the old artil-
leryman

  but there was no doubt that he was right there
was no time to send messengers to the wamasai
to arrest impey barbicane even if the messengers
started from egypt or aden or massowah or
zanzibar however quickly they might travel they
would have to contend with the difficulties of the
country with the obstacles unavoidable on a road
through a mountainous region and probably with
followers acting under the orders of a sultan as
despotic as he was black

  all hope would have to be given up of stopping
the operation or arresting the operator

  but if that was impossible nothing was easier
now than to know the worst that could happen the
firing-point had been revealed and it was a simple
the purchase of

 master  calculation-a complicated calculation
 evidently but not beyond the capacities of alge-
 braists in particular and mathematicians in gen-
 eral

    at first the government kept the despatch secret
 their object being to be able to indicate when they
 published it what would be the results of the dis-
 placement of the axis with regard to the alteration
 in the level of the waters the inhabitants of the
 world would then know the fate that was in store
 for them according to the segment of the spheroid
 on which they resided

   on the th of september the telegram was sent
 to the longitudes office at washington with in-
 str uctions to work out the final consequences
 ballistic and geographical the next day but one
 the information was ready it was cabled at once
 to all the governments of the new and old worlds
 and having been printed in thousands of news-
 papers it was cried in all the great cities by all the
 newsboys of the globe as-

   what is going to happen

   which was the question being asked in every
 language just then

what is going to happen

 nd this is the reply as given by the longitudes
 office

important notice

 the experiment to be attempted by barbicane 
 co is as follows

   to produce a recoil on the nd of september
 at midnight local time by means of a monster
 cannon throwing a projectile of one hundred and
 eighty thousand tons

   if this discharge is effected just below the
 equator near the thirty-eighth meridian at the
 base of the kilimanjaro chain and if it is directed
 toward the south the mechanical effect on thd
 terrestrial spheroid will be as follows

   at once owing to the shock being combined
 with the diurnal movement a new axis will be
 formed the old axis being   and the new one
 being perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic

   in the north the extremity of the new axis
 will be situated between greenland and grinnell
 land on that part of baffin sea cut by the arctic
 circle in the south it will be on the antarctic
 circle to the east of adelaide land

   as an example of the new meridians we may
 mention that passing through dublin in ireland
 paris in france palermo in cicily obeid in dar-
 fur kilimanjaro kerguelen island the new ant-
 arctic pole the society islands in the pacific van-
 couver island and melville peninsula

 the new equator will pass through the kiliman-
 jaro country the indian ocean goa a little below
 calcutta mangala in siam hong kong the mar-
 shall and walker islands in the pacific rio janeiro
 saint helena and by st paul de loanda across
 africa to kilimanjaro

   the new equator having been formed by the
 new axis it is possible to calculate the results on
 the ocean levels

 it is worthy of note that barbicane  co or
 rather the directors of the north polar practical
 association have evidently been desirous of doing

the north pole	

 as little damage as possible had the discharge
 been effected toward the north the consequences
 would have been disastrous for the most civilized
 portions of the globe but by firing toward the south
 the consequences so far as the submergence of the
 land is concerned will only affect the less peopled
 and wilder countries

    the globe will for the purposes of this inquiry
 be divided by two great circles intersecting at
 right angles at kilimanjaro and the antipodes of
 that mountain thus giving four segments two in
 the northern hemisphere and two in the southern
 hemisphere separated by lines in which no altera-
 tion of level will occur

     the northern hemisphere

    the first segment to the west of kilimanjaro
 will comprise africa from the congo to egypt
 europe from turkey to greenland america from
 british columbia to peru and brazil north of san
 salvador-in fact the whole of the north atlantic
 and the greater part of the equatorial atlantic

    the second segment to the east of kilimanjaro
 will comprise the greater part of europe from the
 islack bea to sweden the russian empire arabia
 almost all india persia beloochistan afghanistan
 turkestan the celestial empire mongolia japan
 corea the northern pacific and alaska-and also
 the polar regions so regrettably placed in the pos-
 session of barbicane  co

    the southern hemisphere

    the third segment to the east of kilimanjaro
 will comprise madagascar kerguelen island
 mauritius and the islands of the indian ocean the
 antarctic ocean to the new pole the malay
 peninsula java sumatra borneo the philippines
 australia new zealand and all the southern pacific
 up to the meridian of the society islands

    the fourth segment to the west of kilimanjaro
 will include africa south of the congo and the
 mozambique channel the cape of good hope the
 bouth atlantic south america below pernam-
 buco and lima bolivia brazil uruguay the argen-
 tine confederation tierra del fuego the sand-
 wich and south shetland islands and a portion of
 the south pacific

    mjuch w be the four segments of the globe
 divided by lines of no alteration in level

    in each of these four segments there will be a
 central point where the effect will attain its maxi-
 mum either of increase or decrease

    this maximum will approach  feet at each
 point and at the point the consequences will be
 most serious

    in two segments situated opposite each other in
 the northern and southern hemispheres the sea
 will retire to flow into the two other segments

 in the first segment the atlantic ocean will al-
 most entirely empty itself the point of maximum
 being about the bermudas where the bottom will
 become visible if the dept of the sea in that locality
 be less than  feet consequently between
 america and europe vast territories will be re-
 vealed which the united states great britain
 france spain and portugal can annex pro rata
 to their atlantic coast-lines or otherwise as they
 may think fit but it must be remembered that
 as the waters are lowered so will the air be
 the coast of europe and america will be lifted to


amazing stories

 such an extent that towns placed twenty or even
 thirty degrees from the point of maximum will
 have no more air than is now available at three
 miles from the surface of the sea new york
 philadelphia charlestown panama lisbon mad-
 rid paris london edinburgh dublin will be thus
 elevated but cairo constantinople dantzic stock-
 holm on one side and the western coast towns of
 america on the other will retain their present
 level the bermudas will be in such rarefied air
 as has hitherto been only experienced by aeronauts
 and will become as uninhabitable as the upper peaks
 of the mountains of tibet

  similar effects will be experienced in the op-
posite southern segment comprising the indian
ocean australia and the pacific at adelaide and
melbourne the level of the sea will sink  feet
below them and the air will become so thin and
rarefied as to be unbreathable

  such are the two segments from which the
waters will retire in the sea that will be left there
will probably be many new islands formed by the
summits of submarine mountain-chains

  in the other segments the waters will rise tg
a corresponding height

  in the segment north-east of kilimanjaro the
maximum will be at yakutsk in siberia this
town will be submersed under  feet of water
-less its actual altitude-and thence thinning out
on all sides the flood will spread out over asiatic
russia india china japan and alaska the ural
mountains may possibly appear above the waters as
islands st petersburg and moscow on one side
calcutta bangkok saigon pekin hong kong and
tokyo on the other will disappear beneath the
waves at variable depths but at depths quite suffi-
cient to drown such of the russians hindoos
siamese cochinchinese chinese and japanese who
have not left the country before the catastrophe

  in the segment south-west of kilimanjaro the
disasters will not be of such magnitude as the seg-
ment is in a great measure covered by the atlantic
and pacific the level of which will rise  feet
above the falkland islands but nevertheless much
territory will disappear among others all south
africa from the gulf of guinea and kilimanjaro
to the cpe of good hope all south america south
of central brazil and peru including chili the
argentine republic down to tierra del fuego the
patagonians however tall they may be will not
escape destruction as they will not even have the
resource of escaping to the cordilleras not one of
whose summits will in those parts rise above sea-
level

   such will be the results produced by the changes
 of the level of the waters and such are the
 eventualities for which those interested must pre-
 pare unless something happens to prevent the
 dastardly enterprise of barbicane  co

chapter xvi
the chorus of terror

according to the important notice the
dangers of the position could be avoided or
rather fled from by hurrying off to the
neutral zones

   the people in peril could be divided into two
classes the asphyxiated and the drowned

   the effect of the communication was to give rise
 to very different opinions which soon developed into
 the most violent protestations

   on the side of the asphyxiated were the ameri-
cans of the united states the europeans of the
united kingdom and france spain etc the
prospect of being able to annex territories from the
ocean-bed was not attractive enough to persuade
them to accept the change

   on the side of the drowned were the inhabitants
 of south america and the hindoos russians and
 chinese but great britian was not likely to allow
 barbicane  co to deprive her of her southern
 colonies and the other nations decidedly objected
 to being so summarily disposed of evidently the
 gulf of mexico would be emptied to form a huge
 territory of the antilles which the mexicans and
 americans might claim in accordance with the
 monroe doctrine evidently the lift of the philip-
 pines and celebes would bring up an immense
 region which the british and spanish might share
 but vain such compensation it would never
 balance the loss due to the terrible inundation

  if the new seas were only to rise over the
samoyeds laps fuegians patagonians tartars
even chinese japanese or even argentines the
world might have borne the bereavement but the
catastrophe affected too many of the great powers
for them to bear it quietly

   although the central part would remain much as
it is europe would be lifted in the west and low-
ered in the east that is to say half asphyxiated on
one side and half drowned on the other

   such a state of affairs was unacceptable besides
 the mediterranean would be nearly drained dry and
 that neither french italians spainards g-reeks
 turks nor egyptians cared for as their position on
 its coast gave them indisputable rights over the
 sea and what would be the use of the suez canal
 which would escape owing to its position on the
 neutral line what was to be done with that when
 there was no mediterranean at one end and very
 little red sea at the other-unless it was length-
 ened by several hundred miles

   great britain had no desire to see gibraltar
malta and cyprus transformed into mountain-tops
which ironclads would try to anchor near in vain
and the british government declined to entertain
in any form the suggested compensation from the
risen bed of the atlantic

   in short all the world was in arms against bar-
 bicane  co even the people on the neutral lines
 were urgent in their protests and so it soon came
 about that barbicane nicholl and j t maston were
 put under the ban of humanity

  but how the newspapers prospered what a
rush there was for copies what editions after
editions for the first time in the history of the
newspaper press all the papers of every country
in the world were agreed upon one matter and the
effect of that is more easily imagined than des-
cribed

   j t maston might well believe that his last hour
 was come
the purchase of the north pole	

a mob of lynchers and an empty cell

t n fact a frantic mob broke into his prison on the
a evening of the th of september with the inten-
tion of lynching him and it is well to say the police
made no objection

  the cell was empty with the worthy calcu-
lators weight in gold mrs scorbitt had managed
his escape the jailer was the more ready to be
bribed by a fortune as he had hopes of enjoying it
for some years in fact baltimore like washing-
ton new york and the other chief cities of the
atlantic seaboard was in the list of towns to be
reasonably elevated and in which there would re-
main enough air for the daily consumption of their
inhabitants

  j t maston had gained some mysterious retreat
where he was safe from the fury of popular wrath
thus was the life of the great world-troubler saved
by a womans devotion

  and now only four days remained before barbi-
cane  co did their awful deed the important
notice had been generally understood if there had
been a few skeptics before there were none now
the government issued proclamations to such of
their peoples as were to be sent up into the rarefied
air and to the greater number that were to be
dropped into deep water

  the result was such a migration as had never
been seen not even when the aryan families began
to remove an exodus took place comprising every
branch of the hottentots melanesians negroes
red men yellow men brown men white men

  unfortunately the time was too short it could
be reckoned in hours given a few months the
chinese might abandon china the australians
australia the patagonians patagonia the siberians
siberia

  but time time the time how was it pos-
sible

  migration was useless

  there was only one chane

suppose that barbicane  co were to fail

chapter xvii
the works at kilimanjaro

the country of the wamasai is situated in
the east of central africa between zanzi-
bar and the great lakes our knowledge of
it is due chiefly to thomson johnston count
tekeli and doctor meyer it is a mountainous dis-
trict under the sovereignty of the sultan bali-bali
whose people are negroes and number from thirty
to forty thousand

  three degrees south of the equator rises the
chain of kilimanjaro which lifts its highest sum-
mit over  feet above the sea and commands
northward southward and westward the vast and
fertile plains of the wamasai

   a few miles below the first slopes of the mountain
lies the town of kisongo where the sultan resides
the capital is truth to tell but a large village it
is occupied by a population highly gifted and intel-
ligent and working hard as much by itself as by
its slaves under the iron yoke of bali-bali who is
justly considered to be one of the most remarkable
sovereigns of central africa

  impey barbicane and captain nicholl accom-
panied by ten foremen devoted to the enterprise had
arrived at kisongo in the first week of january
the fact of their departure had only been communi-
cated to j t maston and mrs scorbitt they had
embarked at new york for the cape of good hope
thence they had gone to zanzibar and a bark
secretly chartered had taken them to mombasa on
the other side of the channel an escort from the
sultan had met them at this port and after a diffi-
cult journey of about  miles across this harassed
region obstructed by forests cut up by streams
and checkered with marshes they had reached the
royal residence

  as soon as he had obtained j t mastons cal-
culations barbicane had put himself in communi-
cation with bali-bali through a swedish explorer
who intended to spend a few years in this part of
africa the sultan had become one of the warmest
admirers of the audacious yankee after the cele-
brated moon voyage the fame of which had spread
even to this distant country without disclosing
his object barbicane had obtained from the wama-
sai the needful authority to open important works
at the southern base of kilimanjaro for the very
considerable sum of three hundred thousand dol-
lars bali-bali had engaged to furnish him with the
labor he required to do what he liked with kiliman-
jaro he could take it down if he liked or carry
it away if he could and he became as much the
owner of the mountain as he was of the north
pole

the works in africa

barbicane and his colleague were cordially
welcomed at kisongo bali-bali felt an ad-
miration bordering on adoration for the two illus-
trious voyagers who had launched out in space to
attain the circumlunar regions and sympathized
enthusiastically with the projectors of the myste-
rious works they wished to establish in his kingdom
he undertook that the enterprise should be kept
secret both by himself and his subjects for all of
whom he could answer as not one of the negroes
engaged had the right to leave the works for a day
under penalty of the most dreadful punishments

   on this account the operation was enveloped in a
mystery that the cleverest detectives of america
and europe failed to penetrate and if it was dis-
covered at last it was because the sultan had relaxed
his severity after the completion of the works and
because there are traitors or chatterers even among
negroes it was in this way that richard w trust
the consul at zanzibar got wind of what was hap-
pening at kilimanjaro but at that date the th
of september it was too late to stop barbicane in
the accomplishment of his plans

  the reason that barbicane  co had chosen the
country of the wamasai as the scene of their opera-
tions was that in the first place it was little known
and rarely visited by travelers and secondly that
the mass of kilimanjaro offered all the qualities of
solidity and position necessary for their work be
sides the country was rich in all the materials they
required and these were found under conditions
that made them easily workable

  a few months before leaving the united states
barbicane had learned from the swedish explorer


amazing stories

that iron and coal were abundant in the kiliman-
jaro chain there were no mines to be opened and
no shafts to be driven thousands of feet into the
crust of the earth the minerals were on the sur-
face and had only to be picked up from the ground
and in addition to these there were large deposits
of nitrate of soda and iron pyrites such as were
required for the manufacture of the meli-melonite

  barbicane and nicholl had brought no staff of
workmen with them except the ten foremen on
whom they could depend these could take com-
mand of the ten thousand negroes placed at their
disposal by bali-bali to whom was entrusted the
task of making the monster cannon and its no less
monster projectile

  a fortnight after the arrival of barbicane and
his colleague among the wamasai three large work-
shops had been erected in the south of the moun-
tain one as the foundry for the gun one as the
foundry for the shot and one as the factory for the
meli-melonite

  and how did barbicane  co intend to cast a
cannon of such colossal dimensions the only
chance for the inhabitants of the world was as we
have seen in the difficulty of dealing with such a
huge undertaking

  to cast a cannon a million times larger than a
four hundred pounder would have been beyond the
power of man to make a four hundred pounder
is difficult enough but a four hundred million
pounder barbicane  co did not attempt to do
so it was not a cannon nor even a mortar that
they had in their minds they simply intended to
drive a gallery into the mountain

  evidently this enormous mine would have the
eame effect as a gigantic columbiad the manu-
facture of which would have been as oostly as it
was difficult owing to the thickness it would have
to be to avoid the risk of bursting barbicane 
co had always intended to act in this way and if
j t mastons note-book spoke of a cannon it was
the four hundred pounder he had taken as the basis
of his calculations

  consequently a spot was chosen a hundred feet
up the southern side of the chain from the base of
which the plains extended for miles and miles so
that nothing would be in the way of the projectile
when it was hurled from the long tube in the mass
of kilimanjaro

  with great precision and much labor barbicane
carried on the driving of his tunnel easy to him
was the construction of boring machines worked
with air compressed by the power of the large
waterfalls in the district the holes bored by the
machines were charged with meli-melonite and the
blasting of the rock was easy it being a kind of
syenite composed of orthoclasic felspar and amphi-
bolic hornblende it was a favorable circumstance
that a rock so constituted would strongly resist the
frightful pressure developed by the expansion of
the gas but the height and thickness of the moun-
tain afforded ample security against any exterior
splitting or cracking

the great gun is finished

the thousands of workmen under the guidance
of the ten foremen superintended by barbi-
cane progressed with such zeal and intelligence that

in less than six months the tunnel was finished it
measured nearly ninety feet in diameter and two
thousand feet long as it was important that the
projectile should glide along a perfectly smooth
surface without losing any of the gas deflagration
the interior was lined with a smooth tube of cast
iron this was a much larger affair than the cele-
brated columbiad of tampa town which had sent
the aluminum projectile around the moon but
what is there that is impossible to the engineers of
the modern world

  while the boring went on in the flank of kiliman-
jaro the workmen were busy at the second foundry
while the tube was being built the enormous pro-
jectile was in process of manufacture

  all it consisted of was a mass of cast-iron cylin-
droconical in form weighing one hundred and eight
thousand tons it had never been intended to make
such a casting in one piece but to provide one hun-
dred and eighty masses each of one thousand tons
which could be hoisted into the tube and arranged
in front of the meli-melonite so as to form a com-
pact charge

  it thus became necessary to furnish the second
foundry with four hundred thousand tons of ore
seventy thousand tons of flux and four hundred
thousand tons of good coal which at the outset was
transformed into two hundred and eighty thousand
tons of coke as the deposits were all in the vicinity
this was only a matter of transport

  the greatest difficulty was the construction of the
blast furnaces for dealing with the ore but never-
theless before a month was out ten furnaces were
at work capable each of an output of one hundred
and eighty tons a day this gave eighteen hun-
dred tons in the twenty-four hours and a hundred
and eighty thousand tons in ten working days

  in the meli-melonite factory the work went on
easily and so secretly that the composition of the
explosive was never discovered all went well and
there was hardly an accident to mar the progress

  the sultan was delighted he followed the
operations with indefatigable assiduity and it may
be imagined how his majestys presence stimulated
the zeal of his faithful subjects

  when he asked what it all meant barbicane
would reply engimatically

  it is a work which will change the face of the
world

  a work captain nicholl would add that will
confer on the sultan bali-bali a glory that will
never fade among the monarchs of eastern africa

  and that the sultan of the wamasai felt proud
there is no need for us to insist

the great projectile

on the th of august the works were completed
the tunnel was lined with the smooth iron
tube built up within it at the end lay stored two
thousand tons of meli-melonite in communication
with the box of fulminate then came the pro-
jectile three hundred and forty-five feet long in
front of the projectile was a space of fourteen hun-
dred and fifty feet in which effect would be given
to the impulse due to the expansion of the gas

  that being the case there remained the question
-a question of pure ballistics-would the projectile
have the trajectory assigned to it by j t maston
the purchase of the north pole



the calculations were correct they indicated in
what measure the projectile would deviate to the
east of the meridian of kilimanjaro in virtue of
the earths rotation and what would be the form
of the hyperbolic curve which it described in virtue
of its enormous initial velocity

  second question would it be visible during its
flight no for when it left the tube plunged in
the darkness of the earth it could not be seen and
besides owing to its moderate height it would have
a very considerable angular velocity once it
entered the zone of light the smallness of its volume
would conceal it from the most powerful glasses
and for a stronger reason it would when free from
the influence of terrestrial attraction gravitate for-
ever around the sun

  assuredly barbicane  co might be proud of
the work they were about to complete why was
not j t maston there to admire the admirable
execution of the works which was worthy of the
precision of the calculations that had ispired them
and above all things why was he far away when
the formidable detonation would awake the echoes
of the most distant horizons of africa

  in thinking of him his colleagues had no notion
that he had had to leave ballistic cottage after
escaping from baltimore jail and was now in hid-
ing to save his precious life they knew not to
what a degree public opinion had risen against the
north polar practical association they knew
not what would be the massacres quarterings and
roastings if the people happened to lay hold of them
indeed they were fortunate that when the mine
was fired they could only be saluted by the shouts
of the wamasai

  at last said captain nicholl when on the
evening of the nd of september they were stroll-
ing about at the mouth of the mine

  yes at last and also-ha and barbicane
gave a sigh of relief

  if you had to begin again

  bah we should begin again

  what luck said nicholl that we should have
at our disposal this admirable meli-melonite
which will make you illustrious nicholl
doubtless barbicane said the captain modestly
but do you know how many galleries we should
have had to drive in the flanks of kilimanjaro to
obtain the same result if we had only gun-cotton
like that which flung our projectile at the moon
tell me

  one hundred and eighty barbicane

  well we would have driven them

  and a hundred and eighty projectiles of a hun-
dred and eighty thousand tons

  we would have made them nicholl

  there is no nonsense about men of this stamp
but when artillerists have made the round of the
moon of what could they not be capable

an excited mathematician

and that very evening an hour or two only be-
fore the discharge was to take place and while
barbicane and nicholl were thus congratulating
themselves alcide pierdeux shut up in his room
at baltimore jumped to his feet and whooped like
a redskin

  whoooop mr j t maston you brute you

shall swallow your problem you shall and why
didnt i see that before in the name of a cosine
if i knew where you were i would ask you to supper
and we would have a glass of champagne together
at the very moment your gun is to go off

  and he capered around the room and whirled his
arms about like a railway signal gone mad

  whoooop you old plum-tree you must have
had a big bang when you calculated the cannon of
kilimanjaro hurrah for the cannon of kiliman-
jaro and how many more would you like that
is not only the sine qua non my boy but the sine
cannon i whoooop  

chapter xviii

the wamasai wait far the word to fire

it was the evening of the nd of september-
that memorable date to which public opinion
assigned an influence as disastrous as that of
the st of january 

  twelve hours after the sun passed the meridian
of kilimanjaro that is to say at midnight the hand
of captain nicholl would fire the terrible mine

  from kilimanjaro to baltimore is one hundred
and fourteen degrees or a difference in time of four
hundred and fifty-six minutes at the moment of
discharge it would be twenty-four minutes past
five in the afternoon in the great city of maryland

  the weather was magnificent the sun had just
set on the plains of the wamasai behind a perfectly
clear horizon barbicane  co could not have
wished for a better night a calmer or a more star-
lit one in which to hurl their projectile into space
there was not a cloud to mingle with the artificial
vapor developed by the deflagration of the meli-
melonite

  who knows perhaps barbicane and nicholl
were regretting that they could not take their places
inside the projectile in the first second they could
have traveled over seventeen hundred miles after
having penetrated the mysteries of the lunar world
they would have penetrated those of the solar world
and under conditions differently interesting from
those of hector servadac on the comet gallia

  the sultan bali-bali the great personages of his
court that is to say his minister of finance and his
minister of works and the staff of black workmen
were gathered together to watch their final opera-
tion but with commendable prudence they had
taken up their position three miles away from the
mouth of the mine so as to suffer no inconvenience
from the disturbance of the atmosphere

  around them were a few thousand natives from
kisongo and the villages in the south of the prov-
ince who had been ordered by the sultan to come
and admire the spectacle

  a wire connecting an electric battery with the
detonator of the fulminate in the tube lay ready to
fire the meli-melonite

  as a prelude an excellent repast had assembled
at the same table the sultan his american visitors
and the notabilities of the capital-the whole at the
cost of bali-bali who did the thing all the better
from his knowing he would be reimbursed out of the
ample purse of barbicane  co

  it was eleven oclock when the banquet which had
begun at half-past seven came to an end by a toast


amazing stories

proposed by the sultan in honor of the engineers of
the north polar practical association and the suc-
cess of their undertaking

a failure

in an hour the modification of the geographical
and climatological conditions of the earth
would be an accomplished fact-

 barbicane his colleague and the ten foremen be-
 gan to take up their places around the hut in which
 the electric battery was placed

barbicane chronometer in hand counted the
minutes-and never did they seem so long-those
minutes which seemed not years but centuries

at ten minutes to twelve he and captain nicholl
approached the apparatus which put the wire in
communication with the cannon of kilimanjaro

the sultan his court the crowd of natives
formed an immense circle around them

 it was essential that the discharge should take
 place at the precise moment indicated in the calcula-
 tions of j t maston that is at the instant the sun
 touched the equinoctial line which henceforth he
 would never leave in his apparent orbit around the
 terrestrial spheroid

 five minutes to twelve

 faur minutes to twelve

 three minutes to twelve

two minutes to twelve

 one minute to twelve

barbicane followed the hand of the chronometer
which was lighted by a lantern held by one of the
foremen

 captain nicholl stood with his finger on the but-
 ton of the apparatus ready to close the circuit

twenty seconds to twelve

ten seconds

there was not the suspicion of a shake in the
hand of the impassible captain nicholl he and his
friend were no more excited than when shut up in
the projectile they waited for the columbiad to
despatch them to the moon

 five seconds

one

 fire said barbicane

 and nicholls finger pressed the button

the noise was truly awful the echoes rolled in
thunders far beyond the realm of the wamasai
there was a shrill shriek of the projectile which
traversed the air under the impetus from milliards
of milliards of litres of gas developed by the in-
stantaneous deflagration of two thousand tons of
meli-melonite it seemed as though there had passed
over the surface of the earth one of those storms in
which are gathered all the fury of nature

 and the effect could have been no more terrible if
 all the guns of all the artilleries of the world had
 been joined to the thunders of the sky to give one
 long continuous roar together

chapter xix

j t maston regrets he was not lynched

the capitals of the globe-and also the less
important towns and even the humbler vil-
lages-were as a rule waiting for the result
in a paroxysm of terror the newspapers took care

that the exact moment corresponding to midnight
at kilimanjaro should be thoroughly well known

  at baltimore as we are aware twelve hours after
the passage of the sun on the meridian of kiliman-
jaro it would be  p m

  we need not enlarge on the agony of these mo-
ments the most pewerful pen of modern times
would be helpless to describe them

  that the inhabitants of baltimore ran no dan-
ger of being swept away by the rising sea may be
very true that they would not see chesapeake
bay empty itself and cape hatteras at the end be-
come a mountain crest above the dried atlantic is
agreed but the city like many others not menaced
with emersion or immersion might be shattered by
the shock its monuments thrown down and its
streets engulfed in the abysses that might open in
the ground and was there not a justification for
fearing for those other parts of the world which
would never survive the displacement of the waters

  why certainly

  and so every human being in that city felt a cold
shiver in the spinal marrow during that fatal
minute yes all trembled with terror-but one
and that one was vitrolic alcide who was quietly
sipping a cup of hot coffee as if he and the old world
would last forever

   p m answering to kilimanjaro midnight
passed

  at baltimore-nothing occurred

  at london berlin paris rome constantinople-
nothing not the least shock

  professor milne in the coal-pit at kagoshina in
japan gazed steadily at the seismograph and saw
not the least abnormal movement in the crust of the
earth in that part of the world

  at baltimore there was no sign of any disturb-
ance whatsoever the sky was cloudy and when
the night came it was impossible to see if the ap-
parent movement of the stars had changed-which
would of course have indicated a change in the
earths axis

explanation

what a night did j t maston pass in his re-
treat unknown to all save mrs scorbitt he
raged he raved he could not keep still would
that he had been a few days older to see if the
curve of the sun was modified-an indisputable
proof of the success of the operation on the rd
the change would not be noticeable for on that day
the sun invariably rises due east in every country
of the globe

  in the morning the sun rose just as usual

  major donellan and his friends were on the ter-
race of their hotel they had furnished themselves
with instruments of extreme precision which would
show if the sun described its curve in the plane of
the equator

  there was nothing to show that it did and a few
minutes after it had risen the radiant disk inclined
toward the southern hemisphere

  there was no change in its apparent path

  the major and his colleagues expressed their de-
light by giving three cheers for the sun

  the sky was superb the horizon quite clear from
the mists of the night and never did the glorious
the purchase of the north pole



orb present himself under greater conditions of
splendor before a wondering people

 and the very place noted by the laws of astron-
 omy said baldenak

 of our old astronomy said karkof which these
 madmen attempted to annihilate

 to their cost and shame said jansen

 and the arctic regions will remain under their
 eternal ice said professor harald

 hurrah for the sun shouted donellan he is
 good enough for us as he is

 hurrah hurrah said the others on the bal-
 cony

 then it was that todrin who had said nothing
 remarked judiciously perhaps they have not
 fired

 not fired ejaculated the major aghast

 and that with a different intonation was what
 j t maston and mrs scorbitt said

 not fired

 and that was what the wise and the foolish were
 asking and it was what alcide pierdeux said add-
 ing whether they fired or no it does not matter
 the earth will still spin on its old axis

 no one knew what had passed at kilimanjaro
 but before the end of the day an answer was given
 to the question that puzzled humanity

 there was a telegram from zanzibar-

 to john s wright washington u s a

  zanzibar rd september  a m local time
 discharge took place at midnight from cannon on
 southern side of kilimanjaro projectile traveled
 with fearful shriek awful explosion province
 devastated by a tornado sea risen in the mozam-
 bique channel many ships damaged and driven on
 shore towns and villages annihilated all well
 as usual-richard w trust u s consul

 yes all well as usual i nothing changed in the
 state of affairs except the disasters among the
 wamasai caused by the artificial tornado and the
 wrecks caused by the risen sea

 and had it not been the same when the famous
 columbia had sent its projectile toward the moon
 the shock communicated to the soil of florida had
 only been experienced for a hundred miles around
 but this time the effect ought to have been a hun-
 dred times as great

 under any circumstances the telegram informed
 the world of two matters of interest-

 	the enormous cannon had been made in the
 flank of kilimanjaro

 	it had been fired at the time stated

paying the african money

 and then the world gave a shout of satisfaction
 which was followed by an immense shout of
 laughter

 barbicane  cos attempt had failed piteously
 j t mastons calculations might as well be put in
 the wastepaper basket the north polar practical
 association had nothing now to do but go into
 another kind of liquidation

 could it be possible that the secretary of the
 gun club had made a mistake

 i would rather believe i am deceived in the
 affection with which he inspires me said mrs
 evangelina scorbitt

 and if there was a discomfited being on the face

 of the planet it was j t maston when he saw
 that nothing had changed in the conditions of the
 earths movement he was buoyed up with hope that
 some accident had retarded the work of barbicane
 and nicholl

  but since the zanzibar telegram he had to admit
that the experiment had failed

  failed and the equations the formulae from
which he had deduced the success of the enterprise
was the gun not long enough the projectile not
heavy enough the explosive not strong enough no
it was inadmissible

  j t maston was in such a state of excitement
that he declared he would leave his retreat mrs
scorbit tried in vain to prevent him not that she
feared for his life for the danger was over but
the pleasantries that would be showered on the un-
happy calculator the jokes that would rain on his
work-she would have spared him

  and still more serious what was the reception
the gun club would give him would they retain
him as their secretary after a failure that covered
them with ridicule was not he the author of the
calculations entirely responsible for the collapse

  he would listen to nothing he would yield
neither to the tears nor prayers of mrs scorbitt he
came out of the house in which he was hidden he
appeared in the streets of baltimore he was
recognized and those whom he had menaced in their
fortune and existence whose anxiety he had pro-
longed by his obstinate silence took vengeance on
him by deriding him in every way

  the street boys shouted after him go along old
pole-shifter hallo old clock-jobber hows
the figuring tinker

  and a mob gathered and began to hustle him and
he had to seek refuge in the new park mansion
where mrs scorbitt did her best to console him it
was in vain

  j t maston-after the example of niobe-would
not be consoled his gun had produced no more
effect on the terrestrial spheroid than an ordinary
fire cracker

  a fortnight went by and the world had already
forgotten the north polar practical association a
fortnight and no news of barbicane or captain
nicholl had they perished in the counter-shock
of the explosion victims to the ravages produced
among the wamasai had they paid with their
lives for the biggest mystification of modern times

  no at the explosion barbicane and nicholl had
been thrown down so had the sultan and several
thousand natives but they had all risen again safe
and sound

  is it a success asked bali-bali rubbing his
shoulders

  can you doubt it

  i-doubt it but when shall we know

  in a day or two said barbicane

  did he see that the attempt had failed

  possibly but he never would have admitted it
to the monarch of the wamasai

  two days afterward barbicane and nicholl took
their leave of bali-bali not without paying a good
round sum for the destruction done to the surface
of his kingdom and as the money went to his own
private pocket and his subjects got not a dollar he
had no cause to regret so lucrative an affair


amazing stories

 then the two friends followed by their foremen
 reached zanzibar where they found a vessel start-
 ing for suez there under assumed names they
 took passage to marseilles whence by the p l m
 and the ouest they reached havre where they went
 on board the bourgogne and crossed the atlantic

 in twenty-two days after they left the wamasai
 they were in new york

 on the th of october at three oclock in the
 afternoon they knocked at the door of the mansion
 in new park

 a minute afterward they were in the presence of
 mrs scorbitt and j t maston

chapter xx

     the end of this remarkable story
     arbicane  nicholl 

 - maston

 jlj you

     we

 and in that pronoun spoken simultaneously by
 the two in a singular tone there was everything
 that could be said in the way of irony and reproach

 j t maston passed his iron hook across his fore-
 head then in a voice that hissed between his lips
 he asked

 your gallery at kilimanjaro was two thousand
 feet long and ninety in diameter

 yes

 your projectile weighed one hundred and eighty
 thousand tons

 yes

 and you used two thousand tons of meli-
 melonite

 yes

 the three yess fell like blows of a sledge-hammer
 on j t mastons occiput

 then i conclude- he said

 what asked barbicane

 that as the experiment failed the explosive did
 not give the projectile the necessary initial velo-
 city 

 indeed said captain nicholl

 and that your meli-melonite is only fit for pop-
 guns 

 captain nicholl started at the insult

 maston he exclaimed

 nicholl

 will you fight me with meli-melonite

 no with gun-cotton it is surer

 mrs scorbitt hastened to interfere

 gentlemen gentlemen she said between
 friends

 then impey barbicane put in a word very quietly
 what is the use of abusing each other it is
 certain that the calculations of our friend maston
 were correct and it is certain that the explosive of
 our friend nicholl was sufficient  we followed ex-
 actly the teachings of science and we failed for
 what reason probably we shall never know
 well said the secretary of the gun club we
 will try it again

 and the money which has been lost observed
 captain nicholl

 and public opinion which will not permit you
 to again risk the fate of the world added mrs
 scorbitt

  what will become of the north pole asked
nicholl

  what is the value of the shares in the north
polar practical association asked barbicane

  oh what a fall there had been thereof the
certificates could be bought at waste-paper prices

ridicule develops

such was the memorable fiasco of the gigantic
project of barbicane  co

  if ever unfortunate engineers were overwhelmed
with ridicule if ever there were amusing articles in
the newspapers caricatures comic songs parodies
-it was then barbicane the director of the associa-
tion the members of the gun club were literally
covered with scorn the storm of contempt was so
thoroughly american that it was untranslatable even
in volapuk and europe joined in with such vigor
that at last america was scandalized and then
remembering that barbicane nicholl and maston
were of american birth and belonged to the famous
club of baltimore a reaction in their favor set in
which was almost strong enough to make the united
states declare war against the old world

  but was it ever to be known why the enterprise
failed did the failure prove that the project was
impossible that the forces of which man disposes
will never be sufficient to bring about a change in
the earths diurnal movement that never would the
polar regions be displaced in latitude to such an
extent that their icy mantle will be melted by the
solar rays

  that this was the case appeared undoubted a few
days after the return of barbicane and nicholl to
the united states

  a letter appeared in the parisian temps of the
th of october which did mankind a service in con-
firming it in its feeling of security

a letter from the great mathematician

he letter was the following-

  the abortive attempt to furnish the earth
with a new axis is now known nevertheless the
calculations of j t maston were correctly founded
and would have produced the desired results if by
some inexplicable distraction they had not been nul-
lified by an error at the outset

  in fact the celebrated secretary of the gun club
took for his basis the circumference of the terres-
trial spheroid at forty thousand metres instead of
forty million metres-and that nullified the solution

  how came he to make uch an error what
could have caused it how could so remarkable a
mathematician have made such a mistake con-
jecture is vain

  there is no doubt that the problem of the change
of the terrestrial axis was correctly stated and it
should have been correctly worked out but the
initial error of three noughts produced an error of
twelve noughts in the final result

  it is not a cannon a million times as large as a
four hundred-pounder but a million million million
such cannons hurling a million million million pro-
jectiles of one hundred and eighty thousand tons
that would displace the pole   supposing that
melio-melonite has the expansive power attributed
to it by captain nicholl

in short the discharge of the projectile at kili-
the purchase of the north pole



manjaro has been to displace the pole three microns
-that is one ten-thousandth of an inch and the
maximum effect on the level of the sea must have
been just nine-thousandths of a micron

  the projectile has become a small planet and
henceforth belongs to our system in which it is re-
tained by the solar attraction

alcide pierdeux

  so it was some distraction of j t mastons an
error of three noughts at the beginning of his cal-
culations that had brought this humiliating disaster
on barbicane  co

  the members of the gun club were furious but
among the general public a reaction arose in favor
of the poor fellow after all it was this mistake
which had caused all the evil-or rather all the
good for it saved the world from ruin

  and so compliments came in from all parts and
letters arrived in millions congratulating j t mas-
ton on having forgotten his three noughts

  but that extraordinary man more deeply dis-
gusted than ever would not listen to the congratu-
latory world barbicane nicholl tom hunter
with the wooden leg colonel bloomsberry the
brisk bilsby and their friends would never for
give him

  but at least there remained mrs scorbitt

  at first j t maston refused to admit that he
had made a mistake and set to work to check his
calculations

  vitriolic alcide was however accurate and that
was why when he found the error at the last mo-
ment and had no time to reassure his fellow-men he
so calmly sipped his pleasant hot cup of coffee while
the spinal marrow was so unpleasantly cool in his
fellow-mens backs

  there was no disguising the fact three noughts
had slipped out of the terrestial waist

  then it was that j t maston remembered it
was at the beginning of his labors when he had shut
himself up in ballistic cottage he had written
the number of  on the blackboard

  at that moment came a hurried tinkle from the
telephone he had gone to the instrument he had
exchanged a few words with mrs scorbitt there
was a flash of lightning that upset him and his
blackboard he picked himself and his blackboard
up he began to write in the figures half rubbed
out by the fall he had just written -when
the bell rang a second time and when he returned
to work he had forgotten the three last noughts in
the measure of the earths equator

now all that was the fault of mrs scorbitt if

she had not bothered him he would never have been
knocked down by the return shock of that electrical
discharge

  and so the unhappy woman also received a shock
when j t maston told her how the mistake had
been made yes she was the cause of the disas-
ter  it was her doing that j t maston was now
dishonored for the many years he had to live for
it was the general custom to die as centenarians in
the gun club

  and after the interview j t maston fled from
the house in new park he went back to ballistic
cottage he strode about his work-room saying to
himself

  now i am good for nothing in the world

  not even if you were to marry said a voice
which emotion made heartrending

  it was mi-s scorbitt

  tearful and distracted she had followed j t
maston

  dear maston said she

  well yes said he on one condition-that i
never again touch mathematics

a happy marriage

t abominate them said the widow

  j and thus it was that mrs scorbitt became
mrs j t maston

  as to alcide pierdeux what honor what celebrity
that letter brought him and his old school trans-
lated into all languages copied into all newspapers
it made his name known throughout the world

  it happened therefore that the father of the
pretty provemjale who had refused him his daugh-
ters hand because he was too learned came to read
the famous letter in the petit marseillais without
any assistance he managed to make out its meaning
and then he was seized with remorse and as a pre-
liminary measure sent vitriolic alcide an invitation
to dinner

  and so the world was left as it was

  no attempt was made by barbicane  co to re-
sume business any attempt would have been futile
aclides contention was indisputable it could be
shown by mechanics that to effect a displacement
of   even with meli-melonite so many kili-
manjaro guns or mines would be required that the
surface of the earth could not hold them

  the worlds inhabitants could thus sleep in peace
to modify the conditions of the earths movement
is beyond the powers of man it is not given to
mankind to change the order established by the
creator in the system of the universe

introduction

on february the first  the lady vain was
lost by collision with a derelict when about in
latitude  s and longitude  w

  on january the fifth -that is eleven
months and four days after-my uncle edward
prendick a private gentleman who certainly went
aboard the lady vain at callao and who had been
considered drowned was picked up in latitude  
s and longitude  w in a small open boat of
which the name was illegible but which is sup-
posed to have belonged to the missing schooner ipe-
cacuanha he gave such a strange account of him-
self that he was supposed demented subsequently
he alleged that his mind was a blank from the mo-
ment of his escape from the lady vadn his case
was discussed among psychologists at the time as
a curious instance of the lapse of memory conse-
quent upon physical and mental stress the fol-
lowing narrative was found among his papers by the
undersigned his nephew and heir but unaccom-
panied by any definite request for publication

  the only island known to exist in the region in
which my ucle was picked up is nobles isle a small
volcanic islet and uninhabited it was visited in

 by h m s scorpion a party of sailors then
landed but found nothing living thereon except cer-
tain curious white moths some hogs and rabbits
and some rather peculiar rats so that this narra-
tive is without confirmation in its most essential
particular with that understood there seems no
harm in putting this strange story before the pub-
lic in accordance as i believe with my uncles in-
tentions there is at least this much in its behalf
my unele passed out of human knowledge afeout
latitude  s and longitude  e and reappeared
in the same part of the ocean after a space of eleven
months in some way he must have lived during the
interval and it seems that a schooner called the
ipecacuanha with a drunken captain john davies
did start from africa with a puma and certain other
animals aboard in january  that the vessel
was well known at several ports in the south pacific
and that it finally disappeared from those seas with
a considerable amount of copra aboard sailing to
its unknown fate from bayna in december 
a date that tallies entirely with my uncles story

chapter i

in the dingey of the lady vain

do not propose to add anything to what
has already been written concerning the
loss of the lady vain as every one
knows she collided with a derelict when
ten days out from callao the long-
boat with seven of the crew was picked up eigh-
teen days after by h m
gunboat myrtle and the
story of their terrible pri-
vations has become quite
as well known as the far
more horrible medztsa
case but i have to add
to the published story of
the lady vain another
possibly as horrible and
far stranger it has
hitherto been supposed
that the four men who
were in the dingey perish-
ed but this is incorrect

i have the best of evidence
for this assertion i was
one of the four men

  but in the first place i
must state that there never were four men in the
dingey-the number was three constans who
was seen by the captain to jump into the gig
luckily for us and unluckily for himself did not
reach us he came down out of the tangle of ropes
under the stays of the smashed bowsprit some rope
caught his heel as he let go and he hung for a

moment head downward and then fell and struck
a block or spar floating in the water we pulled
towards him but he never came up

  i say luckily for us he did not reach us and i
might almost say luckily for himself for we had
only a small breaker of water and some soddened
ships biscuits with us so sudden had been the
alarm so unprepared the ship for any disaster we
thought the people on the launch would be better
provisioned though it
seeras they were not
and we tried to hail them
they could not have heard
us and the next morning
when the drizzle cleared
-which was not until
past midday-we could
see nothing of them we
could not stand up to look
about us because of the
pitching of the boat the
two other men who had
escaped so far with me
were a man named hel-
mar a passenger like my-
self and a seaman whose
name i dont know-a
short sturdy man with a
stammer

  we drifted famishing and after our water had
come to an end tormented by an intolerable thirst
for eight days altogether after the second day the
sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm it is quite
impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those
eight days he has not luckily for himself any-

 zjere is a tremendous story by our well-known au-
 thor a story which for gripping and human inter-
 est probably has no parallel in the annals of our whole
 modern literature it is frankly not a very pleasant
 story to read but it is certainly the most daring and
 unusual piece of literature in existence today

   mr wells himself calls the story a possibility we
 do not wish to disagree with him here but it is our opin-
 ion that mr wells has tried to sketch a travesty upon
 human beings and in this he has more than succeeded
 the thin veneer of civilisation with which we humans are
 covered is ruthlessly tom aside in mr wells analogy of
 the human race and it leaves us much as we really arc
 without the veneer

 this is a really engrossing story superb all the way
 through

amazing stories

thing in his memory to imagine with after the
first day we said little to one another and lay in
our places in the boat and stared at the horizon or
watched with eyes that grew larger and more hag-
gard every day the misery and weakness gaining
upon our companions the sun became pitiless the
water ended on the fourth day and we were already
thinking strange things and saying them with our
eyes but it was i think the sixth before helmar
gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking i
remember our voices were dry and thin so that we
bent towards one another and spared our words i
stood out against it with all my might was rather
for scuttling the boat and perishing together among
the sharks that followed us but when helmar said
that if his proposal was accepted we should have
drink the sailor came round to him

  i would not draw lots however and in the night
the sailor whispered to helmar again and again
and i sat in the bows with my clasp-knife in my
hand though i doubt if i had the stuff in me to
fight and in the morning i agreed to helmars
proposal and we handed halfpence to find the odd
man the lot fell upon the sailor but he was the
strongest of us and would not abide by it and
attacked helmar with his hands they grappled
together and almost stood up i crawled along the
boat to them intending to help helmar by grasp-
ing the sailors leg but the sailor stumbled with
the swaying of the boat and the two fell upon the
gunwale and rolled overboard together they sank
like stones i remember laughing at that and won-
dering why i laughed the laugh caught me sud-
denly like a thing from without

  i lay across on one of the thwarts for i know not
how long thinking that if i had the strength i
would drink sea-water and madden myself to die
quickly and even as i lay there i saw with no
more interest than if it had been a picture a sail
come up towards me over the skyline my mind
must have been wandering and yet i remember all
that happened quite distinctly i remember how my
head swayed with the seas and the horizon with the
sail above it danced up and down but i also re-
member as distinctly that i had a persuasion that i
was dead and that i thought what a jest it was that
they should come too late by such a little to catch
me in my body

  for an endless period it seemed to me i lay with
my head on the thwart watching the schooner she
was a little vessel schooner-rigged fore and aft
come up out of the sea she kept tacking to and
fro in a widening compass for she was working
dead into the wind it never entered my head to
attempt to attract attention and i do not remem-
ber anything distinctly after the sight of her side
until i found myself in a little cabin aft theres
a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the gang-
way and of a big red countenance covered with
freckles and surrounded with red hair staring at
me over the bulwarks i also had a disconnected
impression of a dark face with extraordinary eyes
close to mine but that i thought was a nightmare
until i met it again i fancy i recollect some stuff
being poured in between my teeth and that is all

chapter ii

the man who was going nowhere

the cabin in which i found myself was small
and rather untidy a youngish man with
flaxen hair a bristly straw-coloured mous-
tache and a dropping nether lip was sitting and
holding my wrist for a minute we stared at each
other without speaking he had watery grey eyes
oddly void of expression then just overhead came
a sound like an iron bedstead being knocked about
and the low angry growling of some large animal
at the same time the man spoke he repeated his
question-

  how do you feel now

  i think i said i felt all right i could not recol-
lect how i had got there he must have seen the
question in my face for my voice was inaccessible
to me

  you were picked up in a boat starving the
name on the boat was the lady vain and there
were spots of blood on the gunwale

  at the same time my eye caught my hand thin
so that it looked like a dirty skin-purse full of loose
bones and all the business of the boat came back to
me

  have some of this said he and gave me a dose
of some scarlet stuff iced

it tasted like blood and made me feel stronger

  you were in luck said he to get picked up
by a ship with a medical man aboard he spoke
with a slobbering articulation with the ghost of a
lisp

  what ship is this i said slowly hoarse from
my long silence

  its a little trader from arica and callao i
never asked where she came from in the beginning
-out of the land of born fools i guess im a pas-
senger myself from arica the silly ass who
owns her-hes captain too named davies-hes
lost his certificate or something you know the
kind of man-calls the thing the ipecacuanha of
all silly infernal names though when theres much
of a sea without any wind she certainly acts ac-
cording

  then the noise overhead began again a snarling
growl and the voice of a human being together
then another voice telling some heaven-forsaken
idiot to desist

  you were nearly dead said my interlocutor
it was a very near thing indeed but ive put
some stuff into you now notice your arms sore
injections youve been insensible for nearly thirty
hours

  i thought slowly i was distracted now by the
yelping of a number of dogs am i eligible for
solid food i asked

  thanks to me he said even now the mutton
is boiling

  yes i said with assurance i could eat some
mutton

  but said he with a momentary hesitation you
know im dying to hear of how you came to be alone
in that boat damn that howling i thought i
detected a certain suspicion in his eyes

  he suddenly left the cabin and i heard him in
violent controversy with some one who seemed to
me to talk gibberish in response to him the mat-
the island of dr moreau	

ter sounded as though it ended in blows but in that
 thought my ears were mistaken then he shouted
at the dogs and returned to the cabin

  well said he in the doorway you were just
beginning to tell me

  i told him my name edward prendick and how i
had taken to natural history as a relief from the
dullness of my confortable independence

  he seemed interested in this ive done some
science myself i did biology at university college
-getting out the ovary of the earthworm and the
radula of the snail and all that lord its ten
years ago but go on go on tell me about the
boat

  he was evidently satisfied with the frankness of
my story which i told in concise sentences enough
for i felt horribly weak and when it was finished
he reverted at once to the topic of natural history
and his own biological studies he began to ques-
tion me closely about tottenham court road and
gower street is caplatzi still flourishing  what
a shop that was he had evidently been a very
ordinary medical student and drifted incontinently
to the topic of the music halls he told me some
anecdotes left it all he said ten years ago
how jolly it all used to be but i made a young ass
of myself-played myself out before i was twenty-
one i daresay its all different now but i must
look up that ass of a cook and see what hes done
to your mutton

  the growling overhead was renewed so suddenly
and with so much savage anger that it startled me
whats that i called after him but the door had
closed he came back again with the boiled mut-
ton and i was so excited by the appetising smell of
it that i forgot the noise of the beast that had
troubled me

  after a day of alternate sleep and feeding i was
so far recovered as to be able to get from my bunk
to the scuttle and see the green seas trying to keep
pace with us i judged the schooner was running
before the wind montgomery-that was the name
of the flaxen-haired man-came in again as i stood
there and i asked him for some clothes he lent me
some duck things of his own for those i had worn
in the boat had been thrown overboard they were
rather loose for me for he was large and long in
his limbs he told me casually that the captain was
three-parts drunk in his own cabin as i assumed
the clothes i began asking him some questions
about the destination of the ship he said the ship
was bound to hawaii but that it had to land him
first

  where said i

  its an island where i live so far as i know it
hasnt got a name

  he stared at me with his nether lip dropping and
looked so wilfully stupid of a sudden that it came
into my head that he desired to avoid my questions

i had the discretion to ask no more

chapter iii

the strange face

we left the cabin and found a man at the
companion obstructing our way he was
standing on the ladder with his back to us
peering over the combing of the hatchway he was i

could see a mishapen man short broad and clumsy
with a crooked back a hairy neck and a head sunk
between his shoulders he was dressed in dark-
blue serge and had peculiarly thick coarse black
hair i heard the unseen dogs growl furiously and
forthwith he ducked back-coming into contact
with the hand i put out to fend him off from
myself he turned with animal swiftness

   in some indefinable way the black face thus flashed
upon me shocked me profoundly it was a
singularly deformed one the facial part projected
forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle
and the huge half-open mouth showed as big white
teeth as i had ever seen in a human mouth his
eyes were bloodshot at the edges with scarcely a
rim of white round the hazel pupils there was a
curious glow of excitement in his face

  confound you said montgomery why the
devil dont you get out of the way

  the black-faced man started aside without a
word i went on up the companion staring at him
instinctively as i did so montgomery stayed at
the foot for a moment you have no business
here you know he said in a deliberate tone your
place is forward

  the black-faced man cowered they-wont
have me forward he spoke slowly with a queer
hoarse quality in his voice

  wont have you forward said montgomery in
a menacing voice but i tell you to go he was
on the brink of saying something further then
looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the
ladder

  i had paused half way through the hatchway
looking back still astonished beyond measure at
the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced creature
i had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordi-
nary face before and yet-if the contradiction is
credible-i experienced at the same time an odd
feeling that in some way i had already encountered
exactly the features and gestures that now amazed
me afterwards it occurred to me that probably i
had seen him as i was lifted aboard and yet that
scarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous ac-
quaintance yet how one could have set eyes on so
singular a face and yet have forgotten the precise
occasion passed my imagination

  montgomerys movement to follow me released my
attention and i turned and looked about me at the
flush deck of the little schooner i was already half
prepared by the sounds i had heard for what i
saw certainly i never beheld a deck so dirty it
was littered with scraps of carrot shreds of green
stuff and indescribable filth fastened by chains
to the mainmast were a number of grisly stag-
hounds who now began leaping and barking at me
and by the mizzen a huge puma was cramped in a
little iron cage far too small even to give it turn-
ing room farther under the starboard bulwark
were some big hutches containing a number of
rabbits and a solitary llama was squeezed in a
mere box of a cage forward the dogs were muz-
zled by leather straps the only human being on
deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the wheel

  the patched and dirty lower sails were tense in
the wind and up aloft the little ship seemed carry-
ing every sail she had the sky was clear the sun
midway down the western sky long waves capped


amazing stories

by the breeze with froth were running with us
we went past the steersman to the taffrail and saw
the water come foaming under the stern and the
bubbles go dancing and vanishing in her wake i
turned and surveyed the unsavoury length of the
ship

  is this an ocean menagerie said i

  looks like it said montgomery

  what are these beasts for merchandise
curios does the captain think he is going to sell
them somewhere in the south seas

  it looks like it doesnt it said montgomery
and turned towards the wake again

  suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious
blasphemy from the companion hatchway and the
deformed man with the black face came up hur-
riedly he was immediately followed by a heavy
red-haired man in a white cap at the sight of the
former the staghounds who had all tired of barking
at me by this time became furiously excited howl-
ing and leaping against their chains the black
hesitated before them and this gave the red-haired
man time to come up with him and deliver a tre-
mendous blow between the shoulder-blades the
poor devil went down like a felled ox and rolled in
the dirt among the furiously excited dogs it was
lucky for him that they were muzzled the red-
haired man gave a yawp of exultation and stood
staggering and as it seemed to me in serious
danger of either going backwards down the com-
panion hatchway or forward upon his victim

  so soon as the second man had appeared mont-
gomery had started forward steady on there he
cried in a tone of remonstrance a couple of sail-
ors appeared on the forecastle the black-faced
man howling in a singular voice rolled about under
the feet of the dogs no one attempted to help him
the brutes did their best to worry him butting their
muzzles at him there was a quick dance of their
lithe grey-figured bodies over the clumsy prostrate
figure the sailors forward shouted as though
it was admirable sport montgomery gve an
angry exclamation and went striding down the
deck and i followed him the black-faced man
scrambled up and staggered forward going and
leaning over the bulwark by the main shrouds
where he remained panting and glaring over his
shoulder at the dogs the red-haired man laughed
a satisfied laugh

  look here captain said montgomery with
bis lisp a little accentuated gripping the elbows
of the red-haired man this wont do

  i stood behind montgomery the captain came
half round and regarded him with the dull and
solemn eyes of a drunken man wha wont do
he said and added after looking sleepily into
montgomerys face for a minute blasted saw-
bones

  with a sudden movement he shook his arm free
and after two ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled
fists into his side pockets

  that mans a passenger said montgomery
id advise you to keep your hands off him

  go to hell said the eaptain loudly he sud-
denly turned and staggered towards the side do
what i like on my own ship he said

  i think montgomery might have left him then
seeing the brute was drunk but he only turned a

shade paler and followed the captain to the bul-
warks

  look you here captain he said that man of
mine is not to be ill-treated he has been hazed
ever since he came aboard

  for a minute alcoholic fumes kept the captain
speechless blasted sawbones was all he con-
sidered necessary

  i could see that montgomery had one of those
slow pertinacious tempers that will warm day
after day to a white heat and never again cool to
forgiveness and i saw too that this quarrel had
been some time growing the mans drunk said

i	perhaps officiously youll do no good
montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping
lip hes always drunk do you think that ex-
cuses his assaulting his passengers

  my ship began the captain waving his hand
unsteadily towards the cages was a clean ship
look at it now it was certainly anything but
clean crew continued the captain clean
respectable crew

  you agreed to take the beasts

  i wish id never set eyes on your infernal island
what the devil-want beasts for on an island like
that then that man of yours-understood he was
a man hes a lunatic and he hadnt no business
aft do you think the whole damned ship belongs
to you

  tour sailors began to haze the poor devil as
soon as he came aboard

  thats just what he is-hes a devil an ugly
devil my men cant stand him i cant stand him
none of us cans stand him nor you either
montgomery turned away you leave that man
alone anyhow he said nodding his head as he
spoke

  but the captain meant to quarrel now he raised
his voice if he comes this end of the ship again
ill cut his insides out i tell you cut out his
blasted insides who are you to tell me what im
to do i tell you im captain of this ship-captain
and owner im the law here i tell you-the law
and the prophets i bargained to take a man and
his attendant to and from arica and bring back
some animals i never bargained to carry a mad
devil and a silly sawbones a-

  well never mind what he called montgomery i
saw the latter take a step forward and interposed
hes drunk said i the captain began some
abuse even fouler that the last shut up i said
turning on him sharply for i had seen danger in
montgomerys white face with that i brought the
downpour on myself

  however i was glad to avert what was uncom-
monly near a scuffle even at the price of the
captains drunken ill-will i do not think i have
ever heard quite so much vile language come in a
continuous stream from any mans kps before
though i have frequented eccentric company enough
i found some of it hard to endure though i am a
mild-tempered man but certainly when i told the
captain to shut up i had forgotten that i was
merely a bit of human flotsam cut off from my
resources and with my fare unpaid a mere casual
dependant on the bounty or speculative enterprise
of the ship he reminded me of it with consider-
able vigour but at any rate i prevented a fight

chapter iv

at the schooners rail

tiat night land was sighted after sundown
and the schooner hove to montgomery inti-
mated that was his destination it was too
far to see any details it seemed to me then simply
a low-lying batch of dim blue in the uncertain blue-
grey sea an almost vertical streak of smoke went
up from it into the sky the captain was not on deck
when it was sighted after he had vented his wrath
on me he had staggered below and i understand he
went to sleep on the floor of his own cabin the
mate practically assumed the command he was the
gaunt taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel
apparently he was in an evil temper with mont-
gomery he took not the slightest notice of either
of us we dined with him in a sulky silence after
a few ineffectual efforts on my part to talk it
struck me too that the men regarded my companion
and his animals in a singularly unfriendly man-
ner i found montgomery very reticent about his
purpose with these creatures and about his des-
tination and though i was sensible of a growing
curiosity as to both i did not press him

  we remained talking on the quarter deck until
the sky was thick with stars except for an occa-
sional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and a move-
ment of the animals now and then the night was
very still the puma lay crouched together watch-
ing us with shining eyes a black heap in the corner
of its cage montgomery produced some cigars
he talked to me of london in a tone of half-painful
reminiscence asking all kinds of questions about
changes that had taken place he spoke like a man
who had loved his life there and had been suddenly
and irrevocably cut off from it i gossiped as well
as i could of this and that all the time the strange-
ness of him was shaping itself in my mind and as
i talked i pgered at his odd pallid face in the dim
light of the binnacle lantern behind me then i
looked out at the darkling sea where in the dim-
ness his little island was hidden

  this man it seemed to me had come out of im-
mensity merely to save my life to-morrow he
would drop over the side and vanish again out of
my existence even had it been under common-
place circumstances it would have made me a trifle
thoughtful but in the first place was the singularity
of an educated man living on this unknown little
island and coupled with that the extraordinary na-
ture of his luggage i found myself repeating the
captains question what did he want with the
beasts why too had he pretended they were not
his when i had remarked about them at first then
again in his personal attendant there was a bizarre
quality which had impressed me profoundly these
circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the
man they laid hold of my imagination and ham-
pered my tongue

  towards midnight our talk of london died away
and we stood side by side leaning over the bul-
warks and staring dreamily over the silent starlit
sea each pursuing his own thoughts it was the
atmosphere for sentiment and i began upon my
gratitude

  if i may say it said i after a time you have
saved my life

  chance he answered just chance

  i prefer to make my thanks to the accessible
agent

  thank no one you had the need and i had the
knowledge and i injected and fed you much as i
might have collected a specimen i was bored and
wanted something to do if id been jaded that day
or hadnt liked your face well-its a curious ques-
tion where you would have been now

  this damped my mood a little at any rate i
began

   its a chance i tell you he interrupted-as
everything is in a mans life only the asses wont
see it  why am i here now an outcast from civili-
sation instead of being a happy man enjoying all the
pleasures of london simply because eleven years
ago-i lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy
night

  he stopped yes said i

thats all

  we relapsed into silence presently he laughed
theres something in this starlight that loosens
ones tongue im an gss and yet somehow i would
like to tell you

  whatever you tell me you may rely upon my
keeping to myself-if thats it

   he was on the point of beginning and then shook
his head doubtfully

   dont said i it is all the same to me after
all it is better to keep your secret theres noth-
ing gained but a little relief if i respect your con-
fidence if i dont-well

  he grunted undecidedly i felt i had him at a
disadvantage had caught him in the mood of in-
discretion and to tell the truth i was not curious
to learn what might have driven a young medical
student out of london i have an imagination i
shrugged my shoulders and turned away over the
taffrail leant a silent black figure watching the
stars it was montgomerys strange attendant it
looked over its shoulder quickly with my movement
then looked away again

   it may seem a little thing to you perhaps but it
came like a sudden blow to me the only light
near us was a lantern at the wheel the creatures
face was turned for one brief instant out of the
dimness of the stern towards this illumination and
i saw that the eyes that glanced at me shone with a
pale-green light i did not know then that a red-
dish luminosity at least is not uncommon in hu-
man eyes the thing came to me as stark inhu-
manity that black figure with its eyes of fire
struck down through all my adult thoughts and feel-
ings and for a moment the forgotten horrors of
childhood came back to ray mind then the effect
passed as it had come an uncouth black figure
of a man a figure of no particular import hung over
the taffrail against the starlight and i found mont-
gomery was speaking to me

   im thinking of turning in then said he if
youve had enough of this

  i answered him incongruously we went below
and he wished me good-night at the door of my
cabin

  that night i had some very unpleasant dreams
the waning moon rose late its light struck a
ghostly white beam across my cabin and made an
ominous shape on the planking by my bunk then


amazing stories

the staghounds woke and began howling and bay-
ing so that i dreamt fitfully and scarcely slept until
the approach of dawn

chapter v

the man who had nowhere to go

in the early morning it was the second morn-
ing after my recovery and i believe the fourth
after i was picked up i awoke through an
avenue of tumultuous dreams-dreams of guns and
howling mobs-and became sensible of a hoarse
shouting above me i rubbed my eyes and lay lis-
tening to the noise doubtful for a little while of my
whereabouts then came a sudden pattering of bare
feet the sound of heavy objects being thrown about
a violent creaking and the rattling of chains i
heard the swish of the water as the ship was sud-
denly brought round and a foamy yellow-green
wave flew across the little round window and left
it streaming i jumped into my clothes and went
on deck

   as i came up the ladder i saw against the flushed
sky-for the sun was just rising-the broad back
and red hair of the captain and over his shoulder
the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the
mizzen spanker-boom

  the poor brute seemed horribly scared and
crouched in the bottom of its little cage

  overboard with em bawled the captain
oveiboard with em well have a clean ship soon
of the whole bilin of em

  he stood in my way so that i had perforce to
tap his shoulder to come on deck he came round
with a start and staggered back a few paces to
stare at me it needed no expert eye to tell that
the man was still drunk

  hullo said he stupidly and then with a
light coming into his eyes why its mister-
mister

   prendick said i

  prendick be damned said he shut-up
thats your name mister shut-up

  it was no good answering the brute but i cer-
tainly did not expect his next move he held out
his hand to the gangway by which montgomery
stood talking to a massive grey-haired man in
dirty-blue flannels who had apparently just come
aboard

  that way mister blasted shut-up that way
roared the captain

  montgomery and his companion turned as he
spoke

  what do you mean i said

  that way mister blasted shut-up-thats what
i mean overboard mister shut-up-and sharp
were cleaning the ship out-cleaning the whole
blessed ship out and overboard you go

   i stared at him dumbfounded then it occurred to
me that it was exactly the thing i wanted the
lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger with
this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over
i turned towards montgomery

  cant have you said montgomerys companion
concisely

  you cant have me said i aghast he had the
squarest and most resolute face i ever set eyes
upon

  look here i began turning to the captain

  overboard said the captain this ship aint
for beasts and cannibals and worse than beasts
any more overboard you go mister shut-up if
they cant have you you goes overboard but any-
how you go-with your friends ive done with
this blessed island for evermore amen ive had
enough of it

  but montgomery i appealed

  he distorted his lower lip and nodded his head
hopelessly at the grey-haired man beside him to
indicate his powerlessness to help me

  ill see to you presently said the captain

  then began a curious three-cornered altercation
alternately i appealed to one and another of the
three men-first to the grey-haired man to let me
land and then to the drunken captain to keep me
aboard i even bawled entreaties to the sailors
montgomery said never a word only shook his head
youre going overboard i tell you was the cap-
tains refrain law be damned im king here
at last i must confess my voice suddenly broke in
the middle of a vigorous threat i felt a gust of
hysterica petulance and went aft and stared dis-
mally at nothing

  meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the
task of unshipping the packages and caged animals
a large launch with two standing lugs lay under
the lea of the schooner and into this the strange
assortment of goods were swung i did not then
see the hands from the island that were receiving
the packages for the hull of the launch was hid-
den from me by the side of the schooner neither
montgomery nor his companion took the slightest
notice of me but busied themselves in assisting and
directing the four or five sailors who were unload-
ing the goods the captain went forward interfer-
ing rather than assisting i was alternately
despairful and desperate once or twice as i
stood waiting there for things to accomplish them-
selves i could not resist an impulse to laugh at my
miserable quandry i felt all the wretcheder for the
lack of a breakfast hunger and a lack of blood-
corpuscles take all the manhood from a man i
perceived pretty clearly that i had not the stamina
either to resist what the captain chose to do to ex-
pel me or to force myself upon montgomery and his
companion so i waited passively upon fate and
the work of transferring montgomerys possessions
to the launch went on as if i did not exist

  presently that work was finished and then came
a struggle i was hauled resisting weakly enough
to the gangway even then i noticed the oddness
of the brown faces of the men who were with mont-
gomery in the launch but the launch was now
fully laden and was shoved off hastily a broaden-
ing gap of green water appeared under me and i
pushed back with all my strength to avoid falling
headlong the hands in the launch shouted deris-
ively and i heard montgomery curse at them and
then the captain the mate and one of the seamen
helping him ran me aft towards the stern

  the dingey of the lady vain had been towing
behind it was half full of water had no oars and
was quite unvictualled i refused to go aboard her
and flung myself full length on the deck in the
end they swung me into her by a rope for they
had no stern ladder and then they cut me adrift
the island of dr moreau	

i drifted slowly from the schooner in a kind of
stupor i watched all hands take to the rigging and
slowly but surely she came round to the wind the
sails fluttered and then bellied out as the wind
came into them i stared at her weather-beaten side
heeling steeply towards me and then she passed
out of my range of view

   i did not turn my head to follow her at first i
 could scarcely believe what had happened i
 crouched in the bottom of the dingey stunned and
 staring blankly at the vacant oily sea then i
 realized that i was in that little hell of mine again
 now half swamped and looking back over the gun-
 wale i saw the schooner standing away from me
 with the red-haired captain mocking at me over the
 taffrail and turning towards the island saw the
 launch growing smaller as she aproached the
 beach

   abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear
 to me i had no means of reaching the land unless
 i should chance to drift there i was still weak
 you must remember from my exposure in the boat

i was empty and very faint or i should have had
more heart but as it was i suddenly began to sob
and weep as i had never done since i was a little
child the tears ran down my face in a passion
of despair i struck with my fists at the water in the
bottom of the boat and kicked savagely at the
gunwale i prayed aloud for god to let me die

chapter vi

the evil-looking boatmen

but the islanders seeing that i was really
adrift took pity on me i drifted very slowly
to the eastward approaching the island slant-
ingly and presently i saw with hysterical relief
the launch come round and return towards me she
was heavily laden and i could make out as she drew
nearer montgomerys white-haired broad-shouldered
companion sitting cramped up with the dogs and
several packing-cases in the stern sheets this in-
dividual stared fixedly at me without moving or
speaking the black-faced cripple was glaring at
me as fixedly in the bows near the puma there
were three other men besides-three strange brut-
ish-looking fellows at whom the staghounds were
snarling savagely montgomery who was steering
brought the boat by me and rising caught and
fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me for
there was no room aboard

   i had recovered from my hysterical phase by this
 time and answered his hail as he approached
 bravely enough i told him the dingey was nearly
 swamped and he reached me a piggin i was jerked
 back as the rope tightened between the boats for
 some time i was busy baling

  it was not until i had got the water under for
the water in the dingey had been shipped the boat
was perfectly sound that i had leisure to look at
the people in the launch again

   the white-haired man i found was still regarding
 me steadfastly but with an expression as i now
 fancied of some perplexity when my eyes met
 his he looked down at the staghound that sat be-
 tween his knees he was a powerfully-built man
 as i have said with a fine forehead and rather heavy
 features but his eyes had that odd drooping of

the skin above the lids which often comes with
advancing years and the fall of his heavy mouth
at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious
resolution he talked to montgomery in a tone too
low for me to hear

   from him my eyes travelled to his three men
and a strange crew they were i saw only their
faces yet there was something in their faces - i
knew not what-that gave me a queer spasm of
disgust i looked steadily at them and the im-
pression did not pass though i failed to see what
had occasioned it they seemed to me then to be
brown men but their limbs were oddly swathed in
ome thin dirty white stuff down even to the fin-
gers and feet i have never seen men so wrapped
up before and women so only in the east they
wore turbans too and thereunder peered out their
elfin faces at me-faces with protruding lower-jaws
and bright eyes they had lank black hair almost
like horsehair and seemed as they sat to exceed
in stature any race of men i have seen the white-
haired man who i knew was a good six feet in
height sat a head below any one of the three i
found afterwards that really none were taller than
myself but their bodies were abnormally long and
the thigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted
at any rate they were an amazingly ugly gang and
over the heads of them under the forward lug peered
the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous
in the dark as i stared at them they met my gaze
and then first one and then another turned away
from my direct stare and looked at me in an odd
furtive manner it occurred to me that i was per-
haps annoying them and i turned my attention to
the island we were approaching

   it was low and covered with thick vegetation-
 chiefly a kind of palm that was new to me from
 one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slant-
 ingly to an immense height and then frayed out
 like a down feather we were now within the em-
 brace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a
 low promontory the beach was of dull-grey sand
 and sloped steeply up to a ridge perhaps sixty or
 seventy feet above the sea-level and irregularly set
 with trees and undergrowth half way up was a
 square enclosure of some greyish stone which i
 found subsequently was built partly of coral and
 partly of pumiceous lava two thatched roofs
 peeped from within this enclosure a man stood
 awaiting us at the waters edge i fancied while
 we were still far off that i saw some other and very
 grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into the bushes
 upon the slope but i saw nothing of these as we
 drew nearer this man was of a moderate size and
 with a black negroid face he had a large almost
 lipless mouth extraordinary lank arms long thin
 feet and bow-legs and stood with his heavy face
 thrust forward staring at us he was dressed like
 montgomery and his white-haired companion in jac-
 ket and trousers of blue serge as we came still
 nearer this individual began to run to and fro on
 the beach making the most grotesque movements

   at a word of command from montgomery the four
men in the launch sprang up and with singularly
awkward gestures struck the lugs montgomery
steered us round and into a narrow little dock ex-
cavated in the beach then the man on the beach
hastened towards us this dock as i call it was
	amazing

 really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of
 tide to take the longboat i heard the bows ground
 in the sand staved the dingey off the rudder of
 the big boat with my piggin and freeing the
 painter landed the three muffled men with the
 clumiest movements scrambled out upon the sand
 and forthwith set to landing the cargo assisted by
 the man on the beach i was struck especially by
 the curious movements of the legs of the three
 swathed and bandaged boatmen - not stiff they
 were but distorted in some odd way almost as if
 they were jointed in the wrong place the dogs
 were still snarling and strained at their chains
 after these men as the white-haired man landed
 with them the three big fellows spoke to one
 another in odd guttural tones and the man who had
 waited for us on the beach began chattering to them
 excitedly-a foreign language as i fancied-as they
 laid hands on some bales piled near the stern
 somewhere i had heard such a voice before and i
 could not think where the white-haired man stood
 holding in a tumult of six dogs and bawling orders
 over their din montgomery having unshipped the
 rudder landed likewise and all set to work at un-
 loading i was too faint what with my long fast
 and the sun beating down on my bare head to offer
 any assistance

   presently the white-haired man seemed to recol-
lect my presence and came up to me

   you look said he as though you had scarcely
 breakfasted his little eyes were a brilliant black
 under his heavy brows i must apologize for that
 now you are our guest we must make you comfort-
 able-though you are uninvited you know he
 looked keenly into my face montgomery says you
 are an educated man mr prendick says you know
 something of science may i ask what that sig-

nifies	  

   i told him i had spent some years at the royal
college of science and had done some researches
in biology under huxley he raised his eyebrows
slightly at that

   that alters the case a little mr prendick he
 said with a trifle more respect in his manner as
 it happens we are biologists here this is a biologi-
 cal station-of a sort his eye rested on the men
 in white who were busily hauling the puma on rol-
 lers towards the walled yard i and montgomery
 at least he added then when you will be able
 to get away i cant say were off the track to
 anywhere we see a ship once in a twelve-month
 or so

   he left me abruptly and went up the beach past
this group and i think entered the enclosure the
other two men were with montgomery erecting a
pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck
the llama was still on the launch with the rabbit
hutches the staghounds were still lashed to the
thwarts the pile of things completed all three
men laid hold of the truck and began shoving the
ton-weight or so upon it after the puma presently
montgomery left them and coming back to me held
out his hand

   im glad said he for my own part that cap-
 tain was a silly ass hed have made things lively

for you	

   it was you said i that saved me again

   that depends youll find this island an infer-

stories

nally rum plaee i promise you id watch my go-
ings carefully if i were you he- he hesi-
tated and seemed to alter his mind about what was
on his lips i wish youd help me with these rab-
bits he said

   his procedure with the rabbits was singular i
waded in with him and helped him lug one of the
hutches ashore no sooner was that done than he
opened the door of it and tilting the thing on one
end turned its living contents out on the ground
they fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the
other he clapped his hads and forthwith they went
off with that hopping run of theirs fifteen or
twenty of them i should think up the beach

   increase and multiply my friends said mont-
 gomery replenish the island hitherto weve
 had a certain lack of meat here

   as i watched them disappearing the white-haired
 man returned with a brandy-flask and some biscuits
 something to go on with prendick said he in a
 far more familiar tone than before i made no ado
 but set to work on the biscuits at once while the
 white-haired man helped montgomery to release
 about a score more of the rabbits three big
 hutches however went up to the house with the
 puma the brandy i did not touch for i have been
 an abstainer from my birth

chapter vii

the locked door

the reader will perhaps understand that at
first everything was so strange about me and
my position was the outcome of such unex-
pected adventures that i had no discernment of the
relative strangeness of this or that thing i fol-
lowed the llama up the beach and was overtaken by
montgomery who asked me not to enter the stone
enclosure i noticed then that the puma in its cage
and the pile of packages had been placed outside the
entrance to this quadrangle

   i turned and saw that the launch had now been
unloaded run out again and was being beached and
the white-haired man was walking towards us he
addressed montgomery

   and now comes the problem of this uninvited
guest what are we to do with him

   he knows something of science said mont-
gomery

   im itching to get to work again-with this new
 stuff said the white-haired man nodding towards
 the enclosure his eyes grew brighter

   i daresay you are said montgomery in any-
thing but a cordial tone

   we cant send him over there and we cant
spare the time to build him a new shanty and we
certainly cant take him into our confidence just
yet

   im in your hands said i i had no idea of what
 he meant by over there

   ive been thinking of the same things mont-
gomery answered theres my room with the
outer door-

   thats it said the elder man promptly look-
 ing at montgomery and all three of us went to-
 wards the enclosure im sorry to make a mys-
 tery mr prendick but youll remember youre
 uninvited our little establishment here contains
the island of dr moreau



 a secret or so is a kind of blue-beards chamber in
 fact nothing very dreadful really to a sane man
 but just now as we dont know you-

  decidedly said i i should be a fool to take
offence at any want of confidence

  he twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile-
he was one of those saturnine people who smile
with the corners of the mouth down-and bowed
his acknowledgment of my complaisance the main
entrance to the enclosure we passed it was a heavy
wooden gate framed in iron and locked with the
cargo of the launch piled outside it and at the cor-
ner we came to a small doorway i had not previously
observed the white-haired man produced a bundle
of keys from the pocket of his greasy blue jacket
opened this door and entered his keys and the
elaborate locking-up of the place even while it was
still under his eye struck me as peculiar i fol-
lowed him and found myself in a small apartment
plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with
its inner door which was slightly ajar opening into
a paved courtyard this inner door montgomery at
once closed a hammock was slung across the
darker corner of the room and a small unglazed win-
dow defended by an iron bar looked out towards
the sea

  this the white-haired man told me was to be my
apartment and the inner door which for fear of
accidents he said he would lock on the other side
was my limit inward he called my attention to
a convenient deck-chair before the window and to an
array of old books-chiefly i found surgical works
and editions of the latin and greek classics lan-
guages i cannot read with any comfort on a shelf
near the hammock he left the room by the outer
door as if to avoid opening the inner one again

  we usually have our meals in here said mont-
gomery and then as if in doubt went out after
the other moreau  i heard him call and for the
moment i do not think i noticed then as i handled
the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness
where had i heard the rame of moreau before i
sat down before the window took out the biscuits
that still remained to me and ate them with an ex-
cellent appetite moreau 

  through the window i saw one of those unac-
countable men in white lugging a packing-case along
the beach presently the window-frame hid him
then i heard a key inserted and turned in the lock
behind me after a little while i heard through the
locked door the noise of the staghounds that had
now been brought up from the beach they were not
barking but sniffing and growling in a curious fash-
ion i could hear the rapid patter of their feet and
montgomerys voice soothing them

  i was very much impressed by the elaborate
secrecy of these two men regarding the contents of
the place and for some time i was thinking of that
and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name
of moreau but so odd is the human memory that i
could not then recall that well-known name in its
proper connection from that my thoughts went to
the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on
the beach i never saw such a gait such odd mo-
tions as he pulled at the box i recalled that none
of these men had spoken to me though most of
them i had found looking at me at one time or
another in a peculiarly furtive manner quite un-

like the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage
indeed they had all seemed remarkably taciturn
and when they did speak endowed with very un-
canny voices what was wrong with them then
i recalled the eyes of montgomerys ungainly
attendant

  just as i was thinking of him he came in he
was now dressed in white and carried a little tray
with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon i
could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came
bending amiably and placed the tray before me on
the table then astonishment paralyzed me under
his stringy black hair i saw his ear it jumped upon
me suddenly close to my face the man had pointed
ears covered with a fine brown fur

  your breakfast sair he said

  i stared at his face without attempting to an-
swer him he turned and went towards the door
regarding me oddly over his shoulder i followed
him out with my eyes and as i did so by some
odd trick of unconscious cerebration there came
surging into my head the phrase the moreau
hollows-was it the moreau- ah it sent
my memory back ten years the moreau hoirors
the phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment
and then i saw it in red lettering on a little buff-
coloured pamphlet to read which made one shiver
and creep then i remembered distinctly all about
it that long-forgotten pamphlet came back with
startling vividness to my mind i had been a mere
lad then and moreau was i suppose about fifty-
a prominent and masterful physiologist well-knowrf
in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagina-
tion and his brutal directness in discusson

  was this the same moreau he had published
some very astonishing facts in connection with the
transfusion of blood and in addition was known
to be doing valuable work on morbid growths then
suddenly his career was closed he had to leave
england a journalist obtained access to his labor-
atory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant with
the deliberate intention of making sensational ex-
posures and by the help of a shocking accident if
it was an accident his gruesome pamphlet became
notorious on the day of its publication a wretched
dog flayed and otherwise mutilated escaped from
moreaus house it was in the silly season and a
prominent editor a cousin of the temporary labora-
tory-assistant appealed to the conscience of the na-
tion it was not the first time that conscience has
turned against the methods of research the doc-
tor was simply howled out of the country it may
be that he deserved to be but i still think that the
tepid support of his fellow-investigators and his
desertion by the great body of scientific workers was
a shameful thing yet some of his experiments
by the journalists account were wantonly cruel
he might perhaps have purchased his social peace
by abandoning his investigations but he appar-
ently preferred the latter as most men would who
have once fallen under the overmastering spell of
research he was unmarried and had indeed noth-
ing but his own interest to consider

  i felt convinced that this must be the same man
everything pointed to it it dawned upon me to
what end the puma and the other animals-which
had now been brought with other luggage into the
enclosure behind the house-were destined and a


amazing stories

curious faint odour the halitus of something famil-
iar an odour that had been in the background of
my consciousness hitherto suddenly came forward
into the forefront of my thoughts it was the anti-
septic odour of the dissecting-room i heard the
puma growling through the wall and one of the
dogs yelped as though it had been struck

  yet surely and especially to another scientific
man there was nothing so horrible in vivisection
as to account for this secrecy and by some odd
leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous
eyes of montgomerys attendant came back again
before me with the sharpest definition i stared
before me out at the green sea frothing under a
freshening breeze and let these and other strange
memories of the last few days chase one another
through my mind

  what could it all mean  a locked enclosure on a
lonely island a notorious vivisector and these crip-
pled and distorted men

chapter viii

the crying of the puma

montgomery interrupted my tangle of
mystification and suspicion about one
oclock and his grotesque attendant fol-
lowed him with a tray bearing bread some herbs
and other eatables a flask of whiskey a jug of
water and three glasses and knives i glanced
askance at this strange creature and found him
watching me with his queer restless eyes mont-
gomery said he would lunch with me but that
moreau was to preoccupied with some work to
come

  moreau said i i know that name

  the devil you do said he what an ass i
was to mention it to you i might have thought
anyhow it will give you an inkling of our-mys-
teries whiskey

  no thanks im an abstainer

  i wish id been but its no use locking the door
after the steed is stolen it was that infernal stuff
which led to my coming here-that and a foggy
night i thought myself in luck at the time when
moreau offered to get me off its queer-

  montgomery said i suddenly as the outer door
closed why has your man pointed ears

  damn he said over his first mouthful of food
he stared at me for a moment and then repeated
pointed ears

  little points to them said i as calmly as pos-
sible with a catch in my breath and a fine black
fur at the edges

  he helped himself to whiskey and water with
great deliberation i was under the impression-
that his hair covered his ears

  i saw them as he stooped by me to put that
coffee you sent to me on the table and his eyes
shine in the dark

  by this time montgomery had recovered from the
surprise of my question i always thought he
said deliberately with a certain accentuation of his
flavouring of lisp that there was something the
matter with his ears from the way he covered them
what were they like

  i was persuaded from his manner that this ignor-
ance was a pretense still i could hardly tell the

man that i thought him a liar pointed i said
rather small and furry-distinctly furry but the
whole man is one of the strangest beings i ever set
eyes on

  a sharp hoarse cry of animal pain came from the
enclosure behind us its depth and volume testified
to the puma i saw montgomery wince

  yes he said

  where did you pick up the creature 

  san francisco hes an ugly brute i admit
half-witted you know cant remember where he
came from but im used to him you know we
both are how does he strike you

  hes unnatural i said theres something
about him-dont think me fanciful but it gives
me a nasty little sensation a tightening of my
muscles when he comes near me its a touch-
of the diabolical in fact

  montgomery had stopped eating while i told him
this rum he said  cant see it he re-
sumed his meal i had no idea of it he said and
masticated the crew of the schooner must have
felt it the same made a dead set at the poor devil
you saw the captain

  suddenly the puma howled again this time more
painfully montgomery swore under his breath i
had half a mind to attack him about the men on the
beach then the poor brute within gave vent to a
series of short sharp cries	i

  your men on the beach said i what race are
they

  excellent fellows arent they said he absent-
mindedly knitting his brows as the animal yelled
out sharply

  i said no more there was another outcry worse
than the former he looked at me with his dull
grey eyes and then took some more whiskey he
tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol
professing to have saved my life with it he seemed
anxious to lay stress on the fact that i owed my life
to him i answered him distractedly

  presently our meal came to an end the misshapen
monster with the pointed ears cleared the remains
away and montgomery left me alone in the room
again all the time he had been in a state of ill-
concealed irritation at the noise of the vivisected
puma he had spoken of his odd want of nerve and
left me to the obvious application

  i found myself that the cries were singularly irri-
tating and they grew in depth and intensity as the
afternoon wore on they were painful at first but
their constant resurgence at last altogether upset
my balance i flung aside a crib of horace i had
been reading and began to clench my fists to bite
my lips and to pace the room presently i got to
stopping my ears with my fingers

  the emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me
steadily grew at last to such an exquisite expres-
sion of suffering that i could stand it in that con-
fined room no longer i stepped out of the door into
the slumberous heat of the late afternoon and walk-
ing past the main entrance-locked again i noticed
-turned the corner of the wall

  the crying sounded even louder out of doors it
was as if all the pain in the world had found a
voice yet had i known such pain was in the next
room and had it been dumb i believe - i have
thought since-i could have stood it well enough
the island of dr moreau



it is when suffering finds a voice and sets our nerves
quivering that this pity comes troubling us but
in spite of the brilliant sunlight and the green fans
of the trees waving in the soothing sea-breeze the
world was a confusion blurred with drifting black
and red phantasms untili was out of earshot of the
house in the chequered wall

chapter ix

the thing in the forest

i strode through the undergrowth that clothed
the ridge behind the house scarcely heeding
whither i went passed on through the shadow
of a thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond
it and so presently found myself some way on the
other side of the ridge and descending towards a
streamlet that ran through a narrow valley i
paused and listened the distance i had come or
the intervening masses of thicket deadened any
sound that might be coming from the enclosure
the air was still then with a rustle a rabbit
emerged and went scampering up the slope before
me i hesitated and sat down in the edge of the
shade

  the place was a pleasant one the rivulet was
hidden by the luxuriant vegetation of the banks
save at one point where i caught a triangular patch
of its glittering water on the farther side i saw
through a bluish haze a tangle of trees and creepers
and above these again the luminous blue of the sky
here and there a splash of white or crimson marked
the blooming of some trailing epiphyte i let my
eyes wander over this scene for a while and then
began to turn over in my mind again the strange
peculiarities of montgomerys man but it was
too hot to think elaborately and presently i fell into
a tranquil state midway between dozing and waking

  from this i was aroused after i know not how
long by a rustling amidst the greenery on the other
side of the stream for a moment i could see noth-
ing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds
then suddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared
something-at first i could not distinguish what it
was it bowed its round head to the water and be-
gan to drink then i saw it was a man going on
all-fours like a beast he was clothed in bluish
cloth and was of a copper-coloured hue with black
hair it seemed that grotesque ugliness was an in-
variable character of these islanders i could hear
the suck of the water at his lips as he drank

  i leant forward to see him better and a piece of
lava detached by my hand went pattering down
the slope he looked up guiltily and his eyes met
mine forthwith he scrambled to his feet and stood
wiping his clumsy hand across his mouth and re-
garding me his legs were scarcely half the length
of his body so staring one another out of coun-
tenance we remained for perhaps the space of a
minute then stopping to look back once or twice
he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me
and i heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in
the distance and die away long after he had dis-
appeared i remained sitting up staring in the direc-
tion of his retreat my drowsy tranquility had
gone

  i was startled by a noise behind me and turning
suddenly saw the flapping white tail of a rabbit

vanishing up the slope i jumped to my feet the
apparition of this grotesque half-bestial creature
had suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon
for me i looked around me rather nervously and
regretted that i was unarmed then i thought
that the man i had just seen had been clothed in
bluish cloth had not been naked as a savage would
have been and i tried to persuade myself from
that fact that he was after all probably a peaceful
character that the dull ferocity of his countenance
belied him

  yet i was greatly disturbed at the apparition
i walked to the left along the slope turning my
head about and peering this way and that among
the straight stems of the trees why should a man
go on all-fours and drink with his lips presently
i heard an animal wailing again and taking it to
be the puma i turned about and walked in a direc-
tion diametrically opposite to the sound this led
me down to the stream across which i stepped and
pushed my way up through the undergrowth be-
yond

  i was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet
on the ground and going up to it found it to be a
peculiar fungus branched and corrugated like a
foliaceous lichen but deliquescing into slime at the
touch and then in the shadow of some luxuriant
ferns i came upon an unpleasant thing-the dead
body of a rabbit covered with shining flies but still
warm and with the head torn off i stopped aghast
at the sight of the scattered blood here at least
was one visitor to the island disposed of there
were no traces of other violence about it it looked
as though it had been suddenly snatched up and
killed and as i stared at the little furry body came
the difficulty of how the thing had been done the
vague dread that had been in my mind since i had
seen the inhuman face of the man at the stream
grew distincter as i stood there i began to realise
the hardihood of my expedition among these un-
known people the thicket about me became altered
to my imagination every shadow became some-
thing more than a shadow-became an ambush
every rustle became a threat invisible things
seemed watching me i resolved to go back to the
enclosure on the beach i suddenly turned away
and thrust myself violently possibly even franti-
cally through the bushes anxious to get a clear
space about me again

  i stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging
upon an open space it was a kind of glade in the
forest made by a fall seedlings were already start-
ing up to struggle for the vacant space and beyond
the dense growth of stems and twining vines and
splashes of fungus and flowers closed in again be-
fore me squatting together upon the fungoid ruins
of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my ap-
proach were three grotesque human figures one
was evidently a female the other two were men
they were naked save for swathings of scarlet cloth
about the middle and their skins were of a dull
pinkish drab colour such as i had seen in no savages
before they had fat heavy chinless faces re-
treating foreheads and a scant bristly hair upon
their heads i never saw such bestial-looking crea-
tures

  they were talking or at least one of the men
was talking to the other two and all three had been


amazing stories

too closely interested to heed the rustling of my
approach they swayed their heads and shoulders
from side to side the speakers words came thick
and sloppy and though i could hear them distinctly
i could not distinguish what he said he seemed to
me to be reciting some complicated gibberish pres-
ently his articulation became shriller and spread-
ing his hands he rose to his feet at that the
others began to gibber in unison also rising to their
feet spreading their hands and swaying their
bodies in rhythm with their chant i noticed then
the abnormal shortness of their legs and their lank
clumsy feet all three began slowly to circle round
raising and stamping their feet and waving their
arms a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic re-
citation and a refrain-aloola or balloola it
sounded like their eyes began to sparkle and
their ugly faces to brighten with an expression
of strange pleasure saliva dripped from their
lipless mouths

  suddenly as i watched their grotesque and unac-
countable gestures i perceived clearly for the first
time what it was that had offended me what had
given me the two inconsistent and conflicting im-
pressions of utter strangeness and yet of the
strangest familiarity the three creatures engaged
in this mysterious rite were human in shape and
yet human beings with the strangest air about
them of some familiar animal each of these crea-
tures despite its human form its rag of clothing
and the rough humanity of its bodily form had
woven into it-into its movements into the ex-
pression of its countenance into its whole presence
-some now irresistible suggestion of a hog a
swinish taint the unmistakable mark of the beast

  i stood overcome by this amazing realisation and
then the most horrible questionings came rushing
into my mind they began leaping in the air first
one and then the other whooping and grunting
then one slipped and for a moment was on all-
fours-to recover indeed forthwith but that
transitory gleam of the true animalism of these
monsters was enough

  i turned as noiselessly as possible and becoming
every now and then rigid with the fear of being
discovered as a branch cracked or a leaf rustled
i pushed back into the bushes it was long before
i grew bolder and dared to move freely my only
idea for the moment was to get away from these
foul beings and i scarcely noticed that i had
emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees
then suddenly traversing a little glade i saw with
an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among the
trees walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with
my course and perhaps thirty yards away from me
the head and upper part of the body were hidden
by a tangle of creeper i stopped abruptly hoping
the creature did not see me the feet stopped as i
did so nervous was i that i controlled an impulse
to headlong flight with the utmost difficulty then
looking hard i distinguished through the inter-
lacing network the head and body of the brute i had
seen drinking he moved his head there was an
emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me from
the shadow of the trees a half-luminous colour that

in another moment he had vanished behind some
bushes i could not see him but i felt that he had
stopped and was watching me again

  what on earth was he-man or beast what did
he want with me i had no weapon not even a
stick fight would be madness at any rate the
thing whatever it was lacked the courage to attack
me setting my teeth hard i walked straight to-
wards him i was anxious not to show the fear that
seemed chilling my backbone i pushed through a
tangle of tall white-flowered bushes and saw him
twenty paces beyond looking over his shoulder at
me and hesitating i advanced a step or two look-
ing steadfastly into his eyes

  who are you said i

  he tried to meet my gaze no he said sud-
denly and turning went bounding away from me
through the undergrowth then he turned and
stared at me again his eyes shone brightly out
of the dusk under the trees

  my heart was in my mouth but i felt my only
chance was bluff and walked steadily towards him
he turned again and vanished into the dusk oncei
more i thought i caught the glint of his eyes and
that was all

  for the first time i realised how the lateness of
the hour might affect me the sun had set some
minutes since the swift dusk of the tropics was al-
ready fading out of the eastern sky and a pioneer
moth fluttered silently by my head unless i would
spend the night among the unknown dangers of the
mysterious forest i must hasten back to the en-
closure the thought of a return to that pain-
haunted refuge was extremely disagreeable but still
more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open
by darkness and all that darkness might conceal
i gave one more look into the blue shadows that had
swallowed up this odd creature and then retraced
my way down the slope towards the stream going
as i judged in the direction from which i had come

  i walked eagerly my mind confused with many
things and presently found myself in a level place
among scattered trees the colourless clearness
that comes after the sunset flush was darkling the
blue sky above grew momentarily deeper and the
little stars one by one pierced the attenuated light
the interspaces of the trees the gaps in the further
vegetation that had been hazy blue in the daylight
grew black and mysterious i pushed on the
colour vanished from the world the tree-tops rose
against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette
and all below that outline melted into one formless
blackness presently the trees grew thinner and
the shrubby undergrowth more abundant then
there was a desolate space covered with a white
sand and then another expanse of tangled bushes
i did not remember crossing the sand-opening be-
fore i began to be tormented by a faint rustling
upon my right hand i thought at first it was fancy
for whenever i stopped there was silence save for
the evening breeze in the tree-tops then when i
turned to hurry on again there was an echo to my
footsteps

  i turned away from the thickets keeping to the
more open ground and endeavouring by sudden
turns now and then to surprise something in the
act of creeping upon me i saw nothing and never

vanished as he turned his head again he was
motionless for a moment and then with a noiseless
tread began running through the green confusion- theless my sense of another presence grew steadily-
the island of dr moreau

m

i increased my pace and after some time came to
a slight ridge crossed it and turned sharply re-
garding it steadfastly from the further side it
came out black and clear-cut against the darkling
sky and presently a shapeless lump heaved up mo-
mentarily against the sky-line and vanished again
i felt assured now that my tawny-faced antagonist
was stalking me once more and coupled with that
was another unpleasant realisation that i had lost
my way

  for a time i hurried on hopelessly perplexed and
pursued by that stealthy approach whatever it
was the thing either lacked the courage to attack
me or it was waiting to take me at some disad-
vantage i kept studiously to the open at times
i would turn and listen and presently i had half
persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned
the chase or was a mere creation of my disordered
imagination then i heard the sound of the sea i
quickened my footsteps almost into a run and im-
mediately there was a stumble in my reai

  i turned suddenly and stared at the uncertain
trees behind me one black shadow seemed to leap
into another i listened rigid and heard nothing
but the creep of the blood in my ears i thought
that my nerves were unstrung and that my imagi-
nation was tricking me and turned resolutely to-
wards the sound of the sea again

  in a minute or so the trees grew thinner and
i emerged upon a bare low headland running out
into the sombre water the night was calm and
clear and the reflection of the growing multitude of
the stars shivered in the tranquil heaving of the
sea some way out the wash upon an irregular
band of reef shone with a pallid light of its own
westward i saw the zodiacal light mingling with the
yellow brilliance of the evening star the coast fell
away from me to the east and westward it was hid-
den by the shoulder of the cape then i recalled the
fact that moreaus beach lay to the west

  a twig snapped behind me and there was a
rustle i turned and stood facing the dark trees
i could see nothing-or else i could see too much
every dark form in the dimness had its ominous
quality its peculiar suggestion of alert watchful-
ness so i stood for perhaps a minute and then
with an eye to the trees still turned westward to
cross the headland and as i moved one among the
lurking shadows moved to follow me

  my heart beat quickly presently the broad sweep
of a bay to the westward became visible and i
halted again the noiseless shadow halted a dozen
yards from me a little point of light shone on the
further bend of the curve and the grey sweep of
the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight per-
haps two miles away was that little point of light
to get to the beach i should have to go through the
trees where the shadows lurked and down a bushy
slope

  i could see the thing rather more distinctly now
it was no animal for it stood erect at that i
opened my mouth to speak and found a hoarse
phlegm choked my voice i tried again and shouted
who is there there was no answer i ad-
vanced a step the thing did not move only
gathered itself together my foot struck a stone
that gave me an idea without taking my eyes off

the black form before me i stooped and picked up
this lump of rock but at my motion the thing
turned abruptly as a dog might have done and slunk
obliquely into the further darkness then i re-
called a schoolboy expedient against big dogs and
twisted the rock into my handkerchief and gave
this a turn round my wrist i heard a movement
further off among the shadows as if the thing was
in retreat then suddenly my tense excitement gave
way i broke into a profuse perspiration and fell
a-trembling with my adversary routed and this
weapon in my hand

  it was some time before i could summon resolu-
tion to go down through the trees and bushes upon
the flank of the headland to the beach at last i did
it at a run and as i emerged from the thicket upon
the sand i heard some other body come crashing
after me at that i completely lost my head with
fear and began running along the sand forthwith
there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit
i gave a wild cry and redoubled my pace some
dim black things about three or four times the size
of rabbits went running or hopping up from the
beach towards the bushes as i passed

  so long as i live i shall remember the terror of
that chase i ran near the waters edge and heard
every now and then the splash of the feet that
gained upon me far away hopelessly far was the
yellow light all the night about us was black and
still splash splash came the pursuing feet nearer
and nearer i felt my breath going for i was quite
out of training if whooped as i drew it and i felt
a pain like a knife at my side i perceived the thing
would come up with me long before i reached the
enclosure and desperate and sobbing for my breath
i wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came
up to me-struck with all my strength the stone
came out of the sling of the handkerchief as i did
so as i turned the thing which had been running
on all-fours rose to its feet and the missile fell fair
on its left temple the skull rang loud and the
animal-man blundered into me thrust me back with
its hands and went staggering past me to fall head-
long upon the sand with its face in the water and
there it lay still

  i could not bring myself to approach the black
heap i left it there with the water rippling round
it under the still stars and giving it a wide berth
pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the
house and presently with a positive effect of relief
came the pitiful moaning of the puma the sound
that had originally driven me out to explore this
mysterious island at that though i was faint and
horribly fatigued i gathered together all my
strength and began running again towards the
light i thought i heard a voice calling me

chapter x

the crying of the mari

as i drew near the house i saw that the light
shone from the open door of my room and
then i heard coming from out of the dark-
ness at the side of that orange oblong of light the
voice of montgomery shouting prendick i con-
tinued running presently i heard him again i


amazing stories

replied by a feehle hullo and in another moment
had staggered up to him

  where have you been said he holding me at
arms length so that the light from the door fell
on my face we have both been so busy that we
forgot you until about half an hour ago he
led me into the room and set me down in the deck
chair for awhile i was blinded by the light we
did not think you would start to explore this island
of ours with telling us he said and then i was
afraid- but - what - hullo

  my last remaining strength slipped from me and
my head fell forward on my chest i think he found
a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy

  for gods sake said i fasten that door
youve been meeting some of our curiosities
eh said he

  he locked the door and turned to me again he
asked me no questions but gave me some more
brandy and water and pressed me to eat i was in
a state of collapse he said something vague about
his forgetting to warn me and asked me briefly
when i left the house and what i had seen

  i answered him as briefly in fragmentary sen-
tences tell me what it all means said i in a
state bordering on hysterics

  its nothing so very dreadful said he but
i think you have had about enough for one day
the puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain at
that he swore under his breath im damned
said he if this place is not as bad as gower street
with its cats

  montgomery said i what was that thing that
came after me was it a beast or was it a man
if you dont sleep to-night he said youll be
off your head to-morrow

  i stood up in front of him what was that thing
that came after me i asked

  he looked me squarely in the eyes and twisted his
mouth askew his eyes which had seemed animated
a minute before went dull from your account
said he im thinking it was a bogle

  i felt a gust of intense irritation which passed
as quickly as it came i flung myself into the chair
again and pressed my hands on my forehead the
puma began once more

  montgomery came round behind me and put his
hand on my shoulder look here prendick he
said i had no business to let you drift out into
this silly island of ours but its hot so bad as
you feel man your nerves are worked to rags
let me give you something that will make you
sleep that-will keep on for hours yet you must
simply get to sleep or i wont answer for it

  i did not reply i bowed forward and covered
my face with my hands presently he returned with
a small measure containing a dark liquid this he
gave me i took it unresistingly and he helped me
into the hammock

  when i awoke it was broad day for a little
while i lay flat staring at the roof above me the
rafters i observed were made out of the timbers
of a ship then i turned my head and saw a meal
prepared for me on the table i perceived that i
was hungry and prepared to clamber out of the
hammock which very politely anticipating my in-

tention twisted round and deposited me upon all-
fours on the floor

  i got up and sat down before the food i had a
heavy feeling in my head and only the vaguest
memory at first of the things that had happened
over night the morning breeze blew very pleas-
antly through the unglazed window and that and
the food contributed to the sense of animal comfort
which i experienced presently the door behind me
-the door inward towards the yard of the enclosure
-opened i turned and saw montgomerys face

  all right said he im frightfully busy and
he shut the door

  afterwards i discovered that he forgot to re-
lock it then i recalled the expression of his face
the previous night and with that the memory of
all i had experienced reconstructed itself before
me even as that fear came back to me came a
cry from within but this time it was not the cry
of a puma i put down the mouthful that hesitated
upon my lips and listened silence save for the
whisper of the morning breeze i began to think
my ears had deceived me

  after a long pause i resumed my meal but with
my ears still vigilant presently i heard some-
thing else very faint and low i sat as if frozen
in my attitude though it was faint and low it
moved me more profoundly than all that i had
hitherto heard of the abominations behind the
wall there was no mistake this time in the
quality of the dim broken sounds no doubt at all
of their source for it was groaning broken by
sobs and gasps of anguish it was no brute this
time it was a human being in torment

  as i realised this i rose and in three steps had
crossed the rooms seized the handle of the door
into the yard and flung it open before me

  prendick man stop cried montgomery
intervening

  a startled deerhound yelped and snarled there
was blood i saw in the sink-brown and some
scarlet-and i smelt the peculiar smell of carbolic
acid then through an open doorway beyond in
the dim light of the shadow i saw something
bound painfully upon a framework scarred red
and bandaged and then blotting this out appeared
the face of old moreau white and terrible in a
moment he had gripped me by the shoulder with a
hand that was smeared red had twisted me off my
feet and flung me headlong back into my own room
he lifted me as though i was a little child i fell
at full length upon the floor and the door slammed
and shut out the passionate intensity of his face
then i heard the key turn in the lock and mont-
gomerys voice in expostulation

  ruin the work of a lifetime i heard moreau
say

  he does not understand said montgomery
and other things that were inaudible

  i cant spare the time yet said moreau

  the rest i did not hear i picked myself up and
stood trembling my mind a chaos of the most
horrible misgivings could it be possible i
thought that such a thing as the vivisection of
men was carried on here the question shot like
lightning across a tumultuous sky and suddenly
the clouded horror of my mind condensed into a
vivid realisation of my own danger
the island of dr moreau



chapter xi

the hunting of the man

it came before my mind with an unreasonable
hope of escape that the outer door of my room
was still open to me i was convinced now
absolutely assured that moreau had been vivisect-
ing a human being all the time since i had heard
his name i had been trying to link in my mind in
some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders
with his abominations and now i thought i saw
it all the memory of his work on the transfusion
of blood recurred to me these creatures i had
seen were the victims of some hideous experi-
ment these sickening scoundrels had merely in-
tended to keep me back to fool me with their dis-
play of confidence and presently to fall upon me
with a fate more horrible than death-with tor-
ture and after torture the most hideous degrada-
tion it was possible to conceive-to send me ofi a
lost soul a beast to the rest of their comus rout

  j looked round for some weapon nothing then
with an inspiration i turned over the deck chair
put my foot on the side of it and tore away the
side rail it happened that a nail came away with
the wood and projecting gave a touch of danger
to an otherwise petty weapon i heard a step out-
side and incontinently flung open the door and
found montgomery within a yard of it he meant
to lock the outer door i raised this nailed stick
of mine and cut at his face but he sprang back
i hesitated a moment then turned and fled round
the corner of the house prendick man i
heard his astonished cry dont be a silly ass man j

  another minute thought i and he would have
had me locked in and as ready as a hospital rabbit
for my fate he emerged behind the corner for i
heard him shout prendick then he began to
run after me shouting things as he ran this
time running blindly i went northeastward in a
direction at right angles to my previous expedition
once as i went running headlong up the beach
i glanced over my shoulder and saw his attendant
with him i ran furiously up the slope over it
then turning eastward along a rocky valley fringed
on either side with jungle i ran for perhaps a
mile altogether my chest straining my heart beat-
ing in my ears and then hearing nothing of mont-
gomery or his man and feeling upon the verge of
exhaustion i doubled sharply back towards the
beach as i judged and lay down in the shelter of
a canebrake there i remained for a long time too
fearful to move and indeed too fearful even to
plan a course of action the wild scene about me
lay sleeping silently under the sun and the only
sound near me was the thin hum of some small
gnats that had discovered me presently i became
aware of a drowsy breathing sound the soughing
of the sea upon the beach

  after about an hour i heard montgomery shout-
ing my name far away to the north that set me
thinking of my plan of action as i interpreted it
then this island was inhabited only by these two
vivisectors and their animalised victims some of
these no doubt they could press into their service
against me if need arose i knew both moreau and
montgomery carried revolvers and save for a

feeble bar of deal spiked with a small nail the
merest mockery of a mace i was unarmed

   so i lay still until i began to think of food and
drink and at that thought the real hopelessness of
my position came home to me i knew no way of
getting anything to eat i was too ignorant of
botany to discover any resort of root or fruit that
might lie about me i had no means of trapping the
few rabbits upon the island it grew blanker the
more i turned the prospect over at last in the
desperation of my position my mind turned to the
animal men i had encountered i tried to find some
hope in what i remembered of them in turn i
recalled each one i had seen and tried to draw
some augury of assistance from my memory

  then suddenly i heard a stag-hound bay and at
that realised a new danger i took little time to
think or they would have caught me then but
snatching up my nailed stick rushed headlong from
my hiding-place towards the sound of the sea i
remember a growth of thorny plants with spines
that stabbed like pen-knives i emerged bleeding
and with torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek
opening northward i went straight into the water
without a minutes hesitation wading up the creek
and presently finding myself knee-deep in a little
stream i scrambled out at last on the westward
bank and with my heart beating loudly in my ears
crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue i
heard the dog there was only one draw nearer
and yelp when it came to the thorns then i heard
no more and presently began to think i had escaped

  the minutes passed the silence lengthened out
and at last after an hour of security my courage
began to return to me by this time i was no longer
very much terrified or very miserable i had as
it were passed the limit of terror and despair i
felt now that my life was practcically lost and that
persuasion made me capable of daring anything i
had even a certain wish to encounter moreau face
to face and as i had waded into the water i
remembered that if i were too hard pressed at
least one path of escape from torment still lay open
to me-they could not very well prevent my drown-
ing myself i had half a mind to drown myself
then but an odd wish to see the whole adventure
out a queer impersonal spectacular interest in
myself restrained me i stretched my limbs sore
and painful from the pricks of the spiny plants and
stared around me at the trees and so suddenly that
it seemed to jump out of the green tracery about it
my eyes lit upon a black face watching me i saw
that it was the simian creature who had met the
launch upon the beach he was clinging to the
oblique stem of a palm-tree i gripped my stick
and stood up facing him he began chattering
you you you was all i could distinguish at first
suddenly he dropped from the tree and in another
moment was holding the fronds apart and staring
curiously at me

  i did not feel the same repugnance towards this
creature which i had experienced in my encounters
with the other beast men you he said in the
boat he was a man then--at least as much of
a man as montgomerys attendant-for he could
talk

  yes i said i came in the boat from the
ship


amazing stories

  oh he said and his bright restless eyes
travelled over me to my hands to the stick i
carried to my feet to the tattered places in my
coat and the cuts and scratches i had received
from the thorns he seemed puzzled at something
his eyes came back to my hands he held his
own hand out and counted his digits slowly one
two three four five-eigh

  i did not grasp his meaning then afterwards i
was to find that a great proportion of these beast
people had malformed hands lacking sometimes
even three digits but guessing this was in some
way a greeting i did the same thing by way of
reply he grinned with immense satisfaction
then his swift roving glance went round again he
made a swift movement-and vanished the fern
fronds he had stood between came swishing together

  i pushed out of the brake after him and was
astonished to find him swinging cheerfully by one
lank arm from a rope of creeper that looped down
from the foliage overhead his back was to me

   hullo said i

  he came down with a twisting jump and stood
facing me

  i say said i where can i get something to
eat

  eat he said eat mans food now and
his eye went back to the swing of ropes at the
huts

  but where are the huts

  oh

  im new you know

  at that he swung round and set-off at a quick
walk all his motions were curiously rapid come
along said he

  i went with him to see the adventure out i
guessed the huts were some rough shelter where
he and some more of these beast people lived i
might perhaps find them friendly find some handle
in their minds to take hold of i did not know
how far they had forgotten their human heritage

  my ape-like companion trotted along by my side
with his hands hanging down and his jaw thrust
forward i wondered what memory he might have
in him how long have you been on this island
paid i

  how long he asked and after having the
question repeated he held up three fingers

  the creature was little better than an idiot i
tried to make out what he meant by that and it
seems i bored him after another question or
two he suddenly left my side and went leaping at
some fruit that hung from a tree he pulled down
a handful of prickly husks and went on eating the
contents i noted this with satisfaction for here
at least was a hint for feeding i tried him with
some other questions but his chattering prompt
responses were as often as not quite at cross pur-
poses with my question some few were appro-
priate others quite parrot-like

  i was so intent upon these peculiarities that i
scarcely noticed the path we followed presently
we came to trees all charred and brown and so to
a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrusta-
tion across which a drifting smoke pungent in
whiffs to nose and eyes went drifting on our
right over a shoulder of bare rock i saw the level
blue of the sea the path coiled down abruptly into

a narrow ravine between two tumbled and knotty
masses of blackish scori into this we plunged

  it was extremely dark this passage after the
blinding sunlinght reflected from the sulphurous
ground its walls grew steep and approached each
other blotches of green and crimson drifted across
my eyes my conductor stopped suddenly home
said he and i stood on a floor of a chasm that was
at first absolutely dark to me i heard some strange
noises and thrust the knuckles of my left hand
into my eyes i beeame aware of a disagreeable
odor like that of a monkeys cage ill-cleaned be-
yond the rock opened again upon a gradual slope
of sunlit greenery and on either hand the light
smote down through narrow ways into the central
gloom

chapter xii

the sayers of the law

then something cold touched my hand i
started violently and saw close to me a dim
pinkish thing looking more like a flayed
child than anything else in the world the crea-
ture had exactly the mild but repulsive features of
a sloth the same low forehead and slow gestures

   as the first shock of the change of light passed
i saw about me more distintly the little sloth-
like creature was standing and staring at me my
conductor had vanished the place was a narrow
passage between high walls of lava a crack in the
knotted rock and on either side interwoven heaps
of sea-mat palmfans and reeds leaning against
rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens
the winding way up the ravine between these was
scarcely three yards wide and was disfigured by
lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse
which accounted for the disagreeable stench of the
place

   the little pink sloth-creature was still blinking
at me when my ape-man reappeared at the aper-
ture of the nearest of these dens and beckoned me
in as he did so a slouching monster wriggled out
of one of the places further up this strange street
and stood up in featureless silhouette against the
bright green beyond staring at me i hesitated
having half a mind to bolt the way i had come and
then determined to go through with the adventure
i gripped my nailed stick about the middle and
crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after
my conductor

  it was a semi-circular space shaped like the
half of a bee-hive and against the rocky wall that
formed the inner side of it was a pile of variegated
fruits cocoa-nuts among others some rough
vessels of lava and wood stood about the floor and
one on a rough stool there was no fire in the
darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless mass of
darkness that grunted hey as i came in and my
ape-man stood in the dim light of the doorway and
held out a split cocoa-nut to me as i crawled into
the other corner and squatted down i took it
and began gnawing it as serenely as possible in
spite of a certain trepidation and the nearly intoler-
able closeness of the den the little pink sloth-
creature stood in the aperture of the hut and some-
thing else with a drab face and bright eyes cam
staring over its shoulder
the island of dr moreau



  hey came out of the lump of mystery opposite
it is a man

  it is a man gabbled my conductor-a man
a man a five-man like me

  shut up said the voice from the dark and
grunted i gnawed my cocoa-nut amid an impres-
sive stillness

  i peered hard into the blackness but could dis-
tinguish nothing

  it is a man the voice repeated he comes to
live with us

  it was a thick voice with something in it-a kind
of whistling overtone-that struck me as peculiar
but the english accent was strangely good

  the ape-man looked at me as though he expected
something i perceived the pause was interrogative
he comes to live with you i said

  it is a man he must learn the law

  i began to distinguish now a deeper blackness
in the black a vague outline of a hunched-up figure
then i noticed the opening of the place was dark-
ened by two more black heads my hand tightened
on my stick

  the thing in the dark repeated in a louder tone
say the words i had missed its last remark
not to go on all-fours that is the law it repeated
in a kind of sing-song

  i was puzzled

  say the words said the ape-man repeating
and the figures in the doorway echoed this with a
threat in the tone of their voices

  i realised that i had to repeat this idiotic form-
ula and then began the insanest ceremony the
voice in the dark began intoning a mad litany line
by line and i and the rest to repeat it as they
did so they swayed from side to side in the oddest
way and beat their hands upon their knees and i
followed their example i could have imagined i was
already dead and in another world the dark hut
these grotesque dim figures just flecked here and
there by a glimmer of light and all of them sway-
ing in unison and chanting

  not to go on all-fours that is the law are
we not men

  not to suck up drink that is the law are
we not men

  not to eat fish or flesh that is the law are
we not men

  not to claw the bark of trees that is the law
are we not men

  not to chase other men that is the law are
we not men 

  and so from the prohibition of these acts of folly
on to the prohibition of what i thought then
were the maddest most impossible and most in-
decent things one could well imagine a kind of
rhythmic fervour fell on all of us we gabbled and
swayed faster and faster repeating this amazing
law superficially the contagion of these brutes
was upon me but deep down within me the laughter
and disgust struggled together we ran through
a long list of prohibitions and then the chant swung
round to a new formula

  his is the house of pain

  his is the hand that makes

  his is the hand that wounds

  his is the hand that heals

  and so on for another long series mostly quite
incomprehensible gibberish to me about him who-
ever he might be i could have fancied it was a
dream but never before have i heard chanting in a
dream

  his is the lightning flash we sang his is
the deep salt sea

  a horrible fancy came into my head that moreau
after animalising these men had infected their
dwarfed brains with a kind of deification of him-
self however i was too keenly aware of white
teeth and strong claws about me to stop my chant-
ing on that account

  his are the stars in the sky

  at last that song ended i saw the ape-mans
face shining with perspiration and my eyes being
now accustomed to the darkness i saw more dis-
tinctly the figure in the corner from which the
voice came it was the size of a man but it
seemed covered with a dull grey hair almost like
a skye-terrier what was it what were they
all imagine yourself surrounded by all the most
horrible cripples and maniacs it is possible to con-
ceive and you may understand a little of my feel-
ings with these grotesque caricatures of humanity
about me

  he is a five-man a five-man a five-man-like
me said the ape-man

  i held out my hands the grey creature in the
corner leant forward

  not to run on all-fours that is the law are we
not men he said

  he put out a strangely distorted talon and grip-
ped my fingers the thing was almost like the
hoof of a deer produced into claws i could have
yelled with surprise and pain his face came for-
ward and peered at my nails came forward into
the light of the opemng of the hut and i saw with
quivering disgust that it was like the face of neither
man nor beast but a mere shock of grey hair with
three shadowy over-archings to mark the eyes and
mouth

  he has little nails said this grisly creature in
his hairy beard it is well

  he threw my hand down and instinctively i
gripped my stick

  eat roots and herbs it is his will said the
ape-man

  i am the sayer of the law said the grey figure
here come all that be new to learn the law i
sit in the darkness and say the law

  it is even so said one of the beasts in the door-
way

  evil are the punishments of those who break the
law none escape

  none escape said the beast folk glancing
furtively at one another

  none none said the ape-man-none escape
see i did a little thing a wrong thing once i
jabbered jabbered stopped talking none could
understand i am burnt branded in the hand he
is great he is good

  none escape said the grey creature in the
corner

  none escape said the beast people looking
askance at one another


amazing stories

  for every one the want that is bad said the
grey sayer of the law what you will want we
do not know we shall know some want to
follow things that move to watch and slink and
wait and spring to kill and bite bite deep and
rich sucking the blood it is bad not to chase
other men that is the law are we not men
not to eat flesh or fish that is the law are we
not men

  none escape said a dappled brute standing in
the doorway

  for every one the want is bad said the grey
sayer of the law some want to go tearing with
teeth and hands into the roots of things snuffing
into the earth it is bad

  none escape said the men in the door

  some go clawing trees some go scratching at
the graves of the dead some go fighting with fore-
heads or feet or claws some bite suddenly none
giving occasion some love uncleanness

  none escape said the ape-man scratching his
calf

  none escape said the little pink sloth-creature

  punishment is sharp and sure therefore learn
the law say the words

  and incontinently he began again the strange
litany of the law and again i and all these creatures
began singing and swaying my head reeled with
this jabbering and the close stench of the place
but i kept on trusting to find presently some chance
of a new development

  not to go on all-fours that is the law are we
not menf

  we were making such a noise that i noticed noth-
ing of a tumult outside until some one who i
think was one of the two swine men i had seen
thrust his head over the little pink sloth-creature
and shouted something excitedly something that i
did not catch incontinently those at the opening
of the hut vanished my ape-man rushed out the
thing that had sat in the dark followed him i only
observed that it was big and clumsy and covered
with silvery hair and i was left alone then
before i reached the aperture i heard the yelp of a
staghound

  in another moment i was standing outside the
hovel my chair-rail in my hand every muscle of
me quivering before me were the clumsy backs
of perhaps a score of these beast people their
misshapen heads half hidden by their shoulder-
blades they were gesticulating excitedly other
half-animal faces glared interrogation out of the
hovels looking in the direction in which they
faced i saw coming through the haze under the
trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the
dark figure and awful white face of moreau he
was holding the leaping staghound back and close
behind him came montgomery revolver in hand

  for a moment i stood horror-struck i turned
and saw the passage behind me blocked by another
heavy brute with a huge grey face and twinkling
little eyes advancing towards me i looked round
and saw to the right of me and a half-dozen yards
in front of me a narrow gap in the wall of rock
through which a ray of light slanted into the shad-
dows

  stop cried moreau as i strode towards this
and then hold him

  at that first one face turned towards me and then
others their bestial minds were happily slow
i dashed my shoulders into a clumsy monster who
was turning to see what moreau meant and flung
him forward into another i felt his hands fly
round clutching at me and missing me the little
pink sloth-creature dashed at me and i gashed down
its ugly face with the nail in my stick and in an-
other minute was scrambling up a steep side path-
way a kind of sloping chimney out of the ravine
i heard a howl behind me and cries of catch him
hold him and the grey-faced creature appeared
behind me and jammed his huge bulk into the cleft
go on go on they howled i clambered up the
narrow cleft in the rock and came out upon the
sulphur on the westward side of the village of the
beast men

  that gap was altogether fortunate for me for the
narrow chimney slanting obliquely upward must
have impeded the nearer pursuers i ran over the
white space and down a steep slope through a
scattered growth of trees and came to a low-lying
stretch of tall reeds through which i pushed into
a dark thick undergrowth that was black and
succulent under foot as i plunged into the reeds
my foremost pursuers emerged from the gap i
broke my way through this undergrowth for some
minutes the air behind me and about me was soon
full of threatening cries i heard the tumult of my
pursuers in the gap up the slope then the crash-
ing of the reeds and every now and then the
crackling crash of a branch some of the creatures
roared like excited beasts of prey the staghound
yelped to the leffc i heard moreau and montgomery
shouting in the same direction i turned sharply
to the right it seemed to me even then that i
heard montgomery shouting for me to run for my
life

  presently the ground gave rich and oozy under
my feet but i was desperate and went headlong
into it struggled through knee-deep and so came
to a winding path among tall canes the noise of
my pursuers passed away to my left in one place
three strange pink hopping animals about the
size of cats bolted before my footsteps this path-
way ran up-hill across another open space covered
with white incrustation and plunged into a cane-
brake again then suddenly it turned parallel with
the edge of a steep-walled gap which came without
warning like the ha-ha of an english park-turned
with an unexpected abruptness i was still running
with all my might and i never saw this drop until
i was flying headlong through the air

  i fell on my forearms and head among thorns
and rose with a torn ear and bleeding face i had
fallen into a precipitous ravine rocky and thorny
full of hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps
and with a narrow streamlet from which this mist
came meandering down the centre i was astonished
at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight but
i had no time to stand wondering then i turned
to my right down-stream hoping to come to the
sea in that direction and so have my way open to
drown myself it was only later i found that i had
dropped my nailed stick in my fall

  presently the ravine grew narrower for a space
and carelessly i stepped into the stream i jumped
out again pretty quiekly for the water was almost
the island of dr moreau



boiling i noticed too there was a thin sulphurous
scum drifting upon its coiling water almost im-
mediately came a turn in the ravine and the in-
distinct blue horizon the nearer sea was flashing
the sun from a myriad facets i saw my death be-
fore me but i was hot and panting with the warm
blood oozing out on my face and running pleasantly
through my veins i felt more than a touch of
exultation too at having distanced my pursuers it
was not in me then to go out and drown myself yet
i started back the way i had come

  i listened save for the hum of the gnats and the
chirp of some small insects that hopped among the
thorns the air was absolutely still then came
the yelp of a dog very faint and a chattering and
gibbering the snap of a whip and voices they
grew louder then fainter again the noise receded
up the stream and faded away for a while the
chase was over but i knew now how much hope
of help for me lay in the beast people

chapter xiii

a parley

i turned again and went on down towards
the sea i found the hot stream broadened
out to a shallow weedy sand in which an
abundance of crabs and long-bodied many-legged
creatures started from my footfall i walked to
the very edge of the salt water and then i felt i
was safe i turned and stared arms akimbo at the
thick green behind me into which the steamy ravine
cut like a smoking gash but as i say i was too
full of excitement and a true saying though those
who have never known danger may doubt it too
desperate to die

  then it came into my head that there was one
chance before me yet while moreau and mont-
gomery and their bestial rabble chased me through
the island might i not go round the beach until i
came to their enclosure-make a flank march upon
them in fact and then with a rock lugged out of
their loosely-built wall perhaps smash in the lock
of the smaller door and see what i could find knife
pistol or what not to fight them with when they
returned  it was at any rate something to try

  so i turned to the westward and walked along by
the waters edge the setting sun flashed his
blinding heat into my eyes the slight pacific tide
was running in with a gentle ripple presently the
shore fell away southward and the sun came round
upon my right hand then suddenly far in front
of me i saw first one and then several figures
emerging from the bushes-moreau with his grey
staghound then montgomery and two others at
that i stopped

  they saw me and began gesticulating and ad-
vancing i stood watching them approach the
two beast men came running forward to cut me
off from the undergrowth inland montgomery
came running also but straight towards me mor- 
eau followed slower with the dog

  at last i roused myself from my inaction and
turning seaward walked straight into the water
the water was very shallow at first i was thirty
yards out before the waves reached to my waist
dimly i could see the intertidal creatures darting
away from my feet

   what are you doing man cried montgomery

   i turned standing waist deep and stared at them
 montgomery stood panting at the margin of the
 water his face was bright-red with exertion his
 long flaxen hair blown about his head and his drop-
 ping nether lip showed his irregular teeth moreau
 was just coming up his face pale and firm and
 the dog at his hand barked at me both men had
 heavy whips farther up the beach stared the
 beast men

  what am i doing i am going to drown my-
self said i

  montgomery and moreau looked at each other
why asked moreau

   because that is better than being tortured by
you

   i told you so said montgomery and moreau
said something in a low tone

   what makes you think i shall torture you
asked moreau

   what i saw i said and those-yonder

   hush said moreau and held up his hand

  i will not said i they were men what
are they now i at least will not be like them

   i looked past my interlocutors up the beach
were mling montgomerys attendant and one of
the white-swathed brutes from the boat farther
up in the shadow of the trees i saw my little ape-
man and behind him some other dim figures

   who are these creatures said i pointing to
them and raising my voice more and more that it
might reach them they were men men like
yourselves whom you have infected with some
bestial taint-men whom you have enslaved and
whom you still fear you who listen i cried point-
ing now to moreau and shouting past him to the
beast men-you who listen do you not see
these men still fear you go in dread of you  why
then do you fear them  you are many-

   for gods sake cried montgomery stop that
 prendick

   prendick cried moreau

   they both shouted together as if to drown my
voice and behind them lowered the staring faces
of the beast men wondering their deformed hands
hanging down their shoulders hunched up they
seemed as i fancied to be trying to understand
me to remember i thought something of their
human past

   i went on shouting i scarcely remember what
-that moreau and montgomery could be killed that
they were not to be feared that was the burden
of what i put into the heads of the beast people
i saw the green-eyed man in the dark rags who
had met me on the evening of my arrival come out
from among the trees and others followed him
to hear me better at last for want of breath i
paused

   listen to me for a moment said the steady
voice of moreau and then say what you will

 well said i

  he coughed thought then shouted latin
prendick bad latin schoolboy latin but try and
understand hi non sunt homines sunt animalia
qui nos habemus-vivisected a humanising pro-
cess i will explain come ashore

i laughed a pretty story said i they
continued on page

   fthen ho perceived the futility of struggling further he lay quietly  stevens replaced the disrupted tube with a new one and
the horrendous screech that arose as he closed the circuit seemed almost to have something human in its terrible protest
blasphemers plateau



i

a difficult placc to get into

s he expecting you asked the hack driv-
er hopefully extending a gnarled hand
for the bag of the elderly newcomer who
had just alighted from the late afternoon
train

  not exactly mason informed him relinquishing
the bag i just wrote id drop in on him one of
these days and receiving no answer to that i sup-
posed it would be all right for me to come on why
what is it noting the drivers air of disappoint-
ment

  we cant do business then i guess mister
leastwise twouldnt be right for me to drive you
up there and then have to bring you right back now
would it

  mason eyed the shabby old fellow of the delicate
scruples with surprise

  do you mean to tell me i cant get in unless im
expected 

  the driver nodded not after dark you cant
mister itd be that by the time we covered the four
mile to his place he jerked a thumb in the direc-
tion of the crow-bait standing dejectedly between
the shafts of an ancient vehicle the old gray mare
she aint what she used to be he apologized

  youre right agreed mason glancing at the
horse shes no descendant of pegasus to judge by
externals well- what am i to do then if youre so
positive theres no use going up there tonight
where shall i stay theres no sense taking the next
train out that is supposing there is one before
morning

  the driver appraised him swiftly well now
mister you coidd stop up to the travelers hotel for
the night and travel on up in the morning howd
that suit you hotels a mile in the other direction

  mason shrugged his shoulders resignedly  needs
must when the devil drives-oh i beg your par-
don i meant nothing personal he amended at the
drivers laugh all right then the hotel it shall
be

  he climbed into the hack agilely enough for one
of his apparent years and settled into the seat next
the drivers while the latter untied the looped reins
from around the stock of the whin resting in its
socket slapped them up and down and clucked to
the mare

  are you a native
here asked mason as
they backed away from
the station and lurched
into the road

 i ben born and
brought up here mister
responded the driver glad
of an opportunity to while
away the trip ahead

  then you probably
know doctor santurn

onto ten year ago beats all how he keeps to him-
self folks do say though- he stopped appre-
hensively

  go on said mason encouragingly you wont
offend me if its the truth then thats that and if
its a lie ill get him to nail it when i see him to-
morrow

  well-whered his menagerie come from
blurted out the driver turning half around toward
his seat mate

  menagerie do you mean to say he has one

  yes an a quarium too declared the driver
emphatically he had the cages and tanks built
apart from the house fore ever he moved in an
the funny part of it is-whered the animals come
from an the fish we never did see even one
crate come in by way of the railroad station nor
anything that looked like a cage loaded on motor
trucks neither course theres ben two or three
of us ben inside the gates on business-repairs an
sich quite a while ago an they saw plenty an
nown then theres city visitors like yourself but
they never bring nothin but small boxes or a hand-
bag once in a while come to think of it theres
heavy machinery comes by freight but folks tother
side of the plateau say there never was a load of
critters brought in that way neither

  mason frowned whats the difference how they
arrived they probably came by night in covered
motor trucks dont you know the doctor i a
world-famous biologist he knows more about
animals and what makes them tick than the next
best half dozen put together get on with you
man are you trying to build a mystery around
him

  no no mister protested the driver theres
funny doins goes on in those buildings of hisn up
there  the plateau an he never shows himself
a tall he just sends his jap man down with a little
car for mail and supplies an keeps to himself
year in an year out cept for three  four men
round the place there were nearing the hotel
nother half mile or so an well be there whoa
drawing on the reins hear that

  music faint music asked mason

  giddap yes mister something like music
ruther its radio noises from a tremendous big horn
on the roof of the doctors tower we kin hear it
just at this point when the breezes like tis now

funny sometimes 

 this new author whom we now introduce lo our read-
 ers has written ml only a dramatic but a tremend-
 ously gripping story that will hold your interest from be-
 ginning to cud modern science is woven all through it
 and the end comes as dramatic as a sudden thunderclap
 here we see a scientist gone drunk with power until at
 the climax of his achievement he acclaims himself to be
 cod but read and sec what happens

n

 mysterious sounds-a secret menagerie

  sir i cant say i do-nor does anyone
 else round about hes been a mystery
 here senee he built up on the plateau nigh

sounds like a giant cricket
n then again it sounds
like a katydid or a tree
toad the sound carries
most as furs a locomo-
tive whistle

  driver and passenger
completed the ride in sil-
ence each immersed in
thought

  well here we are
mister said the driver as mason climbed down
and paid his fare do you want i should call for
you in the morning

  do you want a peek at the place smiled
mason very well make it nine oclock good
night he turned and entered the small frame


amazing stories

building that boasted the title of hotel and was
heartily received by the rustic proprietor

  sure now mr-mason glancing at the an-
cient register in which the newcomer had inscribed
his name ill be glad to put you up for the night
ill show you to your room sos you can freshen up
a bit and when you come down therell be a snack
of supper on the table for you

what the local inn-keeper said

it was rather cool and gusty outdoors for early
summer and the dark and rutty roadways lack-
ed appeal for an after supper stroll for mason
who contented himself with sitting in the parlor
with his host he recounted what the driver had
told him

  s truth said the innkeeper earnestly to his
solitary guest ben warnt lying you try an get
in on the plateau after dark an youll look down
the mean end of a sawed-off shotgun theres a
night-watchman at the gate an the walls high
an studded with broken glass the watchman
wont listen to no talk whatsoever an while youre
turnin around preparin to come back youll may-
be hear some funny noises from beyond the wall
pardon my asking interrupted mason but
does the doctor owe anything in the village

  no

  anybody miss anything

  not sos ive heard said the innkeeper
anybody disappear without a trace ironically
i see what youre gettin at mr mason sort
of a polite way of askin why dont we mind our
business if he does no harm theres not much to
do in these parts though cept to speculate on other
folks business an i do admit the doctors fair
game for the curious

  fair enough admitted mason i havent seen
him in years myself but from what i know he
likes seclusion and doesnt care for a strange audi-
ence particularly when hes performing some ex-
periment

    taint vivisection ventured the host

  how do you know

  the cages get fuller stead of emptier an the
critters aint breedin cause theres only one of
each carpenter knows he was up there a month
ago to reinforce a cage an he says a big monkey
amost grabbed him tween the bars

  the evening waned rapidly as the innkeeper de-
tailed the petty gossip of the village centering on the
doings that occurred up on the plateau and when
mason climbed gratefully into the huge four-poster
with its generous patchquilt shortly before eleven
he lay wondering what the morrow held in store
despite his deprecations and attempts to dispel the
air of mystery with which the hotel proprietor had
invested the doctor some of the villages supersti-
tion attached itself to him and disturbed his sleep

getting into the blasphemers plateau

after a leisurely breakfast mason settled
his account bade the innkeeper adieu and
climbed for the second time to his seat in
old bens hack which the garrulous driver had
brought around on time

  jog-jog talk-talk jogjjog then the labored
breathing of the old horse as she hauled her bur-
den along the stiff upgrade the scrunch of wheels
overriding the edges of the ruts the clop-clop of
hoofs on the level stretches the cool fresh breezes
of early summer-all these various little sounds
combined in a pleasant unobtrusive symphony that
lulled the tired senses of the elderly passenger and
soothed him into a state of peaceful care-free rever-
ent happiness

  beyond lay the plateau a flattened knoll of some
five acres in expanse toward which the road wound
in tortured undulations between other and lesser
knolls as they neared their destination driver
and passenger became aware of a high stone wall
completely surrounding the estate on the plateau
and when they had approached closely to the en-
trance gate they saw that the top of the wall itself
was prickly with broken glass set in cement

  the main port of entry appeared to be a tall iron
door set flush in the wall and ben sought the bell
affixed to the wall next to it he pressed the button
and then drew back a trifle nervously and stood
abreast with mason who waited to be admitted

  almost at once a small wicket head high was
drawn back from within and a stolid face with
heavy lidded eyes appeared in the opening and
regarded them passively

  well challenged the watchman belligerently
whats your business

  id like to see the doctor said mason passing
his card through the wicket take him my card
please

  wait said the guard and closed the wicket in
the door

  see whispered ben triumphantly what did
i tell you at night youd get no answer atall
less you tried to get over the wall n then the
answerd be buckshot most likely

  there was the sound as of an iron bolt with-
drawn and the heavy door swung inward

  come in said the guard taking masons bag
the doctorll see you at once and to ben who
would have followed noi you cant come in see
the sign private he closed the door in the face
of the disappointed hackman

  the residence was set back at some little distance
within the gate and as mason traversed the gravel
path to it with his guide he glanced with interest
about the enclosure by now a thousand questions
had sprung to mind elicited by his unusual recep-
tion by that forbidding wall and medieval gate by
the strange-looking buildings just beyond the resi-
dence and by the house itself drab and repellent in
the bright sunshine of the summer morning

  he followed the guard up a short flight of four
steps and then at a gesture from the man pre-
ceded him through the vestibule and stopped on
perceiving the subject of his visit

a good reception from dr santarti

on the threshold of a low-raftered sitting
room which was sumptuously furnished
around a principal color motif of mahogany
stood doctor santurn with hand extended

gary he exclaimed delightedly hurrying for-
blasphemers plateau

ward to shake masons hand and pat him on the
shoulder youre more welcome than i can say
when did you arrive

   last night said mason dryly but they told
me-

   enough i cried the doctor contritely hoist by
 my own petard this red tape with which i am
 forced to surround myself seems to have snared
 me badly if it deprived me of your company last
 night of all the people ive longed to see how
 much time have you he broke off

   all there is declared mason leisurely my
last book is now on the presses and im at loose
ends for a while he regarded his old friend
closely

   im just sizing you up  he said to see what
 ravages the years have wrought

   and you find- asked the doctor

   few youre still slight you always were
more ethereal than physical i recall those spec-
tacle lenses are just a trifle thicker-a natural
thing for a bookworm same amount of hair
nearer white than gray patting his own thinned
out crop ruefully and the same old world-defying
twirl to those distinctive moustaches of yours on
the whole i should say the years have treated you
kindly

   and you too rejoined the doctor im more
overjoyed every second that you can make a long
visit with me ill have you settled all ship-shape
and proper in short order

   he picked up a felt hammer and smote a huge
gong with the mallet the mellow booming note
instantly summoning a bland and imperturbable
japanese

   suki said the doctor you will prepare the
south bedchamber for mr mason and make him so
comfortable that he wont want to leave in a hurry
take his bag up now

   a mirthless smile appeared and disappeared so
quickly on sukis face that mason almost doubted
he had seen it

   if you can withstand the pressure of your curi-
 osity said the doctor save your questions until
 later until you orientate yourself i suppose youd
 like to make the rounds with me

   surely said mason is that the library be-
yond

   you scent books as unerringly as a setter its
quarry smiled the doctor very well first the
library he drew mason to the door at the far end
of the sitting room

   here are some thousands of volumes said the
doctor and every one earns its keep your own
archaeology series has its own niche of honor and
is exempt from the rules for a books admission
here

   rules asked mason puzzled

   certainly we have no room for any hut books
of science here and new books at that as soon
as a new volume comes out that supersedes or dis-
proves an old one out goes the old with one other

exception-ah youve come to it as mason

who had been browsing at random among the for-
midable array of tomes stopped before a section in
the far corner of the room

   why whats this oliver cried mason in as-
tonishment books on religion the koran
holy bible oriental and occidental beliefs su-
perstitions agnosticism bhuddistic philosophy
i m quite astounded i had no idea that you were so
interested in theology and religion generally
doctor santurns eyes gleamed oddly behind the
shielding lenses of his heavy spectacles

   so much so gary that all my work revolves
about my personal beliefs i am attempting to
throw new light on immortality and the resurrec-
tion via the laboratory route

going through the laboratory and meeting the
assistants

mason was conscious of a twinge of fear for
his old friends sanity and scrutinized his
face closely hopefully seeking the clue to
some jest but finding the doctor in serious mood
he forced himself to speak casually

   what luck oliver he asked
some confessed the doctor considerable
in fact almost more than you will be able to as-
similate or credit for some time but enough of this
mysticism we can return here later come with
me if you will and acclimate yourself to the atmos-
phere up here on the plateau

   he led the way through a short hallway passing
 the foot of a staircase which ran to the upper floor
  living quarters are upstairs he explained
 the kitchen is back here to one side where suki
 reigns unmolested the main laboratory is in the
 rear extension on the other side well leave that
 until this evening just now let us visit the indi-
 vidual workshops

   they left the house by the front way following
 the gravel path around the side and to the rear to
 the first of three squat gray buildings this one
 was surmounted by a cylindrical brick tower fully
 thirty feet in height and this in turn was topped
 by a sixty-foot mast carefully braced and guyed
 to cement blocks set in the ground itself on either
 side of the edifice a similar mast rose from the
 ground a hundred feet away and between the two
 depended the strands of a cage type of radio an-
 tenna

    this is the electro-physical laboratory explain-
 ed the doctor as he opened the door and led the way
 in

   hello stevens he said what are you up to
now

   a pleasant-faced clean shaven man of middle age
 with a scholarly stoop to his shoulders rose from
 the laboratory stool on which he had been perched
 intent on his work he kept his hand on a knob-
 like contrivance connected with a peculiar type of
 galvanometer and some other unfamiliar apparatus
 and shut off a small almost noiseless alternator
 the armature of which continued to turn for almost
 a half minute after the circuit had been opened so
 great had been its speed

   doctor santum performed the introduction

   you can speak freely in front of mr mason
he advised

 i am progressing rapidly reported stevens
but i feel somehow that the plasma is contamin-
	amazing

ated the vibratory rate is lower than i expected
theres resistance somewhere

   ill see that bridges makes up a fresh supply
for you the doctor assured him he turned to
mason were just arriving at the responsive
vibratory rate of blood plasma and seeing the
archaeologists look of incredulity he continued
no were not delirious come along

   the second building was a replica of the first
laboratory externally but it lacked the tower and
radio mast doctor santurn rapped at the door

   all right bridges he called sometimes he
resents intrusion at a critical moment he explained
in an aside before the door opened

   a bald weazoned and swarthy individual in a
grayish smock appeared in the doorway and
glanced at their feet immediately

   youre all right doctor but ill have to get a
 pair of rubbers for this gentleman he acknowl-
 eged the introduction to mason excused himself for
 a moment and returned at once with a heavy pair
 of rubbers mason put them on wondering at the
 thick cushiony spring-rubber treads

   unlike the other mosques explained the doctor
 with a curious little laugh we require you to put
 on footgear before entering at this shrine of
 bridges

   move lightly cautioned the little man come

rows on rows of kegs and vats lined the
walls huge containers of chemical reagents
from which the smaller stock bottles in their
racks were evidently replenished the glitter of
glassware grotesquely shaped flasks and tubes the
sheen of lacquered brass scores of test tubes in
serried array in racks an indefineable odor of com-
mingled gases gave to the room the atmosphere of
a merlins retreat

   we do things in ai wholesale way explained
bridges we can perform almost any sort of bio-
chemical experiment here from the infinitesimally
small to those requiring a hundredweight or more
of materials theres a bacterial incubator in that
corner and a refrigerator in this-duplicates of
those in the zoo 

   electrically controlled supplemented the doc-
 tor most of our heating and all our lighting
 comes on those wires strung on the poles you passed
 on the road coming up here the town beyond sup-
 plies us with current and keeps the meter at their
 end of our private line so that the total current con-
 sumption is recorded there no matter what new de-
 vices we hook on here it keeps inspectors from
 coming up here constantly and incidentally excludes
 them from a glimpse of affairs that do not concern
 them naturally i pay well for the privacy

  he approached the workbench whereon reposed
the bulkiest microscope mason had ever seen it
rested under a glass bell on a rubber pad

   how far have you gotten bridges asked his
chief

   bridges waved a hand at a row of stoppered test
tubes containing various colored fluids

   the solutions are still settling doctor that is

stories

why i wanted to have you avoid all unnecessary
jarring the qualitative analysis is completed
quantitative will be finished by this evening
when stevens checks up with me tonight ill make
a leukocyte for you 

   mason gasped audibly and doctor santurn turned
 to regard him with a self-satisfied smile

  are you astounded i assure you were not
trying to pull your leg to paraphrase old shakes-
peare there are more things on the plateau
gary than you ever dreamt of in your phil-
osophy 

   i dont believe what ive heard vociferated
mason stoutly how can i such things are pre-
posterous do you mean to tell me-

   not a thing said doctor santurn tonight
you shall see at present i want you to steep a bit
longer let us go over to see johnssen

what the village says about it all

exceedingly bewildered a trifle loathe to
leave the fascination of the bio-chemical lab-
oratory mason followed after the doctor
and with him kept to the path to the last of the
three one-room buildings that lay to the rear of
the residence

   here we are said the doctor passing with
mason through the door this place houses our
menagerie and equarium

   then its true exclaimed mason recalling the
 innkeepers story

   what is asked the doctor

   one of the rumors the village is circulating
about you

   is it a crime to possess a private collection
 asked the doctor ironically

   no-o

   heres johnssen interrupted the doctor

  a huge man approached them-a man perhaps
fifty years of age yet whose full head of ash blond
hair unlined ruddy face and keen sea-green eyes
gave the impression of a remarkable state of preser-
vation

   what is new here asked the doctor

  we need a new thermostat for the primates
cage said johnssen the words rumbling slowly
and deeply in his throat our youngster coughed
once or twice last evening it was chilly if you
remember and im afraid he caught a cold the
old thermostat sticks somewhere around seventy
and id like to get up to about ninety-five for emer-
gencies

are you referring to that orang asked mason

   yes said johnssen the devil for a two-
year-old specimen born and brought up in captivity
one would think hed be up to the usual monkey
tricks not he he sits there quietly and watches
watches-

   born and brought up here asked mason of the
doctor

that is correct hes always been an orphan

   cryptic as most of the things i hear retorted
 mason a trifle impatiently i simply cant contain
 myself much longer what is this all about

he leaned over the guard rail built around a huge
blasphemers plateau



tank set into the floor and partitioned off into num-
erous smaller sections each of which contained a
fish or small amphibian he waved a hand at the
cages set about the walls the orang being the larg-
est of the various occupants

  where are the lions and tigers the ones the
villagers claim to have heard asked mason

  so long as they didnt claim actually to have
seen them said the doctor my faith in the yokels
is unshaken they merely hear the sounds of cer-
tain local insects and birds amplified and sent out
through the horn in the tower in order to test the
attraction of the sounds for similar species we
occasionally use a radio decoy so to speak in testing
our transmitter also we convert various forms
of radiant energy into radio equivalents and try
them out too and much noise results we have actu-
ally transmitted the equivalent of radium gamma
rays the various waves found in polarized light
and in x-rays as well as the usual radio waves at
the other end of the scale which reach into the
thousands of meters

 to get back to this collection however he con-
tinued i tell you truthfully that every one of the
specimens you see here was born on the premises

  that python

  almost three years ago and hes as big as the
usual forty or fity year old specimen the doctor
assured him

  the badger the lemur and that brown toad
persisted mason

  everyone of them

  i give up confessed mason

  you had better until after luncheon gary ad-
vised the doctor come along johnssen its
time to eat

  the three men left the miniature zoo and aquari-
um and strolled back to the house together where
stevens and bridges joined them shortly

synthetic snakes

suki served them deftly and silently while they
conversed about the topics nearest to their
hearts the talk was most amazing to mason
who was reluctant to appear gullible

  mason here is an old college chum of mine
explained the doctor after dabbling in science
he commenced on theology and then by easy stages
drifted into archaeology in order to substantiate for
himself some of the beliefs he had picked up as
for me you see how i have departed from the paths
of goodness you neednt hesitate to speak frankly
before our friend here hell get the general import
of your remarks hes kept up with events in the
scientific world-the known scientific world he
amended

  stevens began

  have you ever heard of a radio wave measuring
one meter

  surely said mason affably

  one of a millimeter persisted stevens

  not in radio work though probably some of the
radium wave emanations are shorter than that

  have you ever heard of a quadrillimeter or a
pentillimeter

  get  with you said mason with some asper-
ity there are no such words or measurements
youre making game of me

  doctor santurn smiled the swarthy weazened
bridges chuckled and johnssen rumbled mirth-
fully

  bridges took up the cudgels

  will synthetic gin produce the dtv to you
knowledge he asked slyly

  very likely snapped mason on guard

  then a man who has taken sufficient synthetic
liquor over a long enough period of time should see
synthetic snakes and animals shouldnt he
clever jeered mason synthetic jnakes
fancy them

  no dont fancy them they exist youve seen
one yourself

  what this is too thick for me cried mason
but they gave him no mercy

  its your turn johnssen said the chief

  do you remember the ancient myth about min-
erva springing forth full-fledged from the head of
jupiter

  yes-well

  of course its a myth conceded johnssen
but its not so far from what might be possible
mason extended his cigar-case around the table
the cigars are on me gentlemen i assure you
they contain no hasheesh or other substance calcu-
lated to encourage your fabrications miinchhausen
himself would feel abashed in your presence

  his table-mates laughed in good spirits at his in-
credulity as they rose to go back to their separate
tasks and to mason there was something forbid-
dingly convincing in the fact that not one of them
had attempted to bolster his argument for argu-
ments sake

the nitrogen cycle

the sun had descended through its arc during
the afternoon sending through the red
stained-glass panels of the westerly windows
of the library queer bloody mottlings on the backs
of the books that lined the walls as mason and the
doctor discussed the work on the plateau

  gary do i appear rational to you the doctor
had asked

  your question implies some self-doubt as to your
own sanity i presume judging fx-om externals and
as a layman i can truthfully say you appear noth-
ing out of the ordinary your manner of speech
however has disturbed me somewhat but on the
whole id say youd pass as nothing worse than
slightly eccentric

  ah the doctor had said but after i have
proceeded a little youll think differently no doubt
shall i start with fundamentals

  do

  and then the biologist had entered on the weird-
est and most unforseen harangue that it had even
been masons lot to attend

  have you ever heard of the nitrogen cycle
where the element nitrogen fixed by bacteria on
grass roots is ingested by cattle turned into pro-
teins eaten by humans and returned again to soil
and air and so on ad infinitum

  surely said mason thats elementary
thats immortality corrected doctor santurn
nitrogen immortality and just as demonstratable
in every element

  nitrogen will always be nitrogen so long as the


amazing stories

orbits of the electrons in its atom remain undis-
turbed a change or a disturbance of the electrons
will transform it into something else perhaps into
heavier or lighter nitrogen perhaps into an entirely
different substance i know that to be true of every
element

  now we take a big jump and consider a human
being just before death occurs

  the blood courses through the vascular system
nourishing the tissues then the vital impulse
ceases the circulation stops the tissue cells
starved for oxygen and nourishment begin to dis-
integrate into their inert protoplasmic elements

  electronic activity in the individual atoms how-
ever goes on forever despite the gross dissolution
and decay of the body the elementary matter of
which the body is composed is indestructible no
matter what form the body ultimately attains in the
process of disintegration

  thats natures method of analysis of reducing
a body into the individual and original elements
which compose it does she waste these elements

  she does not of course not she borrows a few
carbon molecules here a little calcium there per-
haps some sulphur and hydrogen elsewhere then
she combines them in proper proportion kindles
them with the magic wand of radiant energy and
presto a new living organism is in our midst-
perhaps an amoeba or one of the yeasts mayhap
bird or beast or even a new human being

  you mean said mason intensely interested
that death merely disarranges the atomic com-
position of a body by interfering with the vibratory
rate of its electrons and then by a rearrangement
of the chemical elements of the deceased and a new
vibratory impulse nature creates a new form of
life from the old

  essentially yes agreed the doctor only
your definitions of death nature and life mean
separate things to you whereas to me they mean
god now right here i am about to utter what
may sound like blasphemy to those ears of yours
which drank in too much in those theology lectures
of long ago when you were just a plastic and im-
pressionable boy

the doctor and his visitor disagree

tp  can do these things-if i can reduce an
n range the same elements so theyll again be
jl organism to its components and then rear-
instinct with life will i not be god myself

  i see said mason his voice bitter with disap-
pointment  me und gott as the kaiser once re-
marked youre a megalomaniac

  your reactions do you credit gary said doc-
tor santurn shrugging his shoulders apologetically
but dont misunderstand me i am not i have no
desire to be-divine i am just an inchworm meas-
uring its length against the unknown end of
sciences yardstick in an attempt to reach a certain
goal

  a non-existent goal snorted mason disgusted-
ly

  i desire to prove continued the doctor that
spiritual immortality does not exist because physi-
cal atomic immortality precludes the possibility
and that goes for resurrection too a mans body
dies disintegrates and his atoms are used again to

build other forms his spirit is merely the vibra-
tion which stimulates the electrons in their orbits
yes sneered mason skeptically

  the doctor flushed but continued in the same
pedantic manner

  in radio work there are two sorts of waves we
recognize the damped or extinguished type and
the continuous or undamped variety

  mortal life is subject to damped impulses the
damping of vibrations may take place in a single
cell in an hour in man a vast collection of cells it
may require threescore and ten or in the case of
our old friend methuselah nine hundred and sixty
three years barring accident and applying a
proper continuous vibratory impulse to man we
should be enabled to keep him going indefinitely

  i am not interested in that aspect of immortal-
ity my friend it would interfere with the economic
scheme of things but i am desirous of showing
that there is no spirit that persists beyond mans
dissolution death merely damps his vital vibra-
tions extinguishes the impulse so to speak only
his molecules atoms and electrons live on forever
he fell silent lost in reverie and mason wrapped
in horrified speculation did not disturb him at
length he broke the silence

  and when you demonstrate your thesis to man-
kind oliver what do you expect to accomplish
doctor santurn brought up his wandering
thoughts with a jerk recollected time place and
adversary and formulated his answer

  ah gary i want to wipe out religion the
curse of humanity i want men to live their years
with the knowledge that what they waste here can-
not by any form of expiation be made up in the
hereafter that heaven holds no greater reward
than they are capable of achieving right here in the
one existence and that hell is a consciousness of
error when there are no barriers of religion be-
tween man and man such as differences in faith
now present then the brotherhood of man will have
arrived

  you forget one thing interrupted mason
mans tendency to turn for assistance in time of
stress to a higher power

the doctor not an atheist

  it an is a worm retorted doctor santurn

    vi do you actually believe go guides the
i x destinies of every individual bit of living
protoplasm he does yes in a wholesale way he
leaves the inconsequential details to the commun-
ity he endows us with knowledge sufficient for our
well-being and with a sense of ethics for the sake
of society he gives us the rudiments the formulae
for successful living and then washes his hands of
us knowing that our neighbors will reward or pun-
ish us as we deserve

  you are not exactly an atheist said mason

puzzled and yet-

  i an ntheist hardly gary i do believe this
much that a great power created the earth and all
that is therein but he or it merely supplied the
crude elements that might still be found to-day if
all living matter were reduced to its lowest common
components

  then he planted a cell here another there and
gave them the initial impulse that made them in-
blasphemers plateau



stinct with what you call life the rest he left to
evolution which adapted them to changing condi-
tions and environments through the aeons

  if i understand you correctly rejoined mason
evolution nature call it whatever you will is the
only true minister of the deity

 doctor santurn nodded pleased

 call it that or call it a physical chemical or a
mechanical force so long as you leave out all ref-
erence to the spiritual

the effect on the visitor mason

something clutched at masons heart then
perhaps the memory of his father long ago
on a thanksgiving day saying grace over the
festive board of the little new england farmhouse
he thought too of his mother laid away to the ac-
companiment of a clerical assurance of her spiritual
persistence of his own wedding and the old phrase
whom god hath joined let no man put asunder
and of the same dear wifes promise just prior to
her decease to wait for him on the other side

  but oliver santurn would deny these blessed
things to mankind he thought bitterly he would
rob humanity of the fruits and leave them the
husks

  it was all too preposterous of course neither
the doctor nor any other man could compass these
wild visions and bring them to fruition every wail-
ing soul outraged from the time of cro-magnon
on downward through the ages would frustrate
them

  it did serve to show him however a cold and
sinister picture of one whom he had thought of
warmly as a friend for almost forty years

some of the wonders

doctor santurns main laboratory in the ex-
tension to the rear of the residence was
brilliantly illuminated by searchlights set
well away in the corners so as to be non-interfering
magnetically with the delicate apparatus assembled
on the insulated table in the center the clear white
beams were directed against a cluster of parabolic
reflectors suspended from the domed ceiling
which focused the light upon the table below

  the room itself was somewhat of a composite of
the three mason had visited in the morning and
was reserved for the purpose of correlating the sep-
arate facts ascertained in the individual depart-
ments and applying them in actual experiment

  the doctor and his assistants were garbed in
sterile white surgeons garb gauze-masked and rub-
ber-gloved and they had provided the visitor with
a similar outfit he now stood listening attentively
to the chiefs remarks

  the slide is sterile as you see having been
carefully subjected to heavy moist heat pressure
in the sterilizer for thirty minutes the microscope
shows it to be free from organisms the instru-
ments bridges is using have also been carefully
sterilized watch him carefully as i call off rates
and quantities

  under what appeared to mason as the central lens
of a quadruplex microscope bridges placed another
sterile glass slide and to it transferred an infinites-
imal speck of some element the little man now
jbent to a stereoscopic eyepiece and with a delicate

stylus tapered down to the invisibility of a wollas-
ton wire teased and crushed the speck until mason
could no longer discern it

  he is breaking down that particle into its basic
crystals murmured the doctor in explanation it
is an easier method-arrived at by us after con-
siderable research-to use separate and individual
crystals whose atomic weights we know than to
add or subtract via the scales method we used to
at first but now we have listed the exact weights
of basic crystals

  he turned towards bridges three he ordered

  at bridges invitation mason peered through the
eyepiece and taking the fine probe in his unprac-
ticed fingers saw what appeared to be a telegraph
pole prodding at a great pile of small white gran-
ular boulders there was a deep valley beyond the
mass and across the gap lay three of the small
builders by themselves

  again and again the doctor called off substances
and quantities until at last the requisite number of
various crystals had been assembled in an inert
mass on a fresh slide a drop of clear blood serum
added and the whole surrounded by an incredibly
thin iridium washer and sealed by a cover glass

  mason looked again through the quadruplex mic-
roscope and felt reassured that the mass was ac-
tually inert a mound of chemicals in a puddle of
clear fluid

  your turn stevens called the doctor have
you found the rate

  yes doctor the wave is one hundred and five
pentjllimeters for human leukocytes various har-
monics will produce mammalian piscatory or ser-
pentine varieties shall i proceed 

  by all means urged the chief

 steps of amplification

a bank of twenty-four vacuum tubes some-
what resembling those used for radio pur-
poses had been arranged at the end of the
table opposite the microscopical and chemical ap-
paratus and to a metallic slab in their midst
bridges now carefully transferred the slide with
sterile tweezers

  stevens then turned a milli-vernier lateral clamp
so that its edges made contact with the flat iridium
jvasher under the coverglass on the slide

  with twenty four cascaded steps of radio fre-
quency amplification ahead of it explained
stevens and the contents of this slide acting as
the grid of the detector a tremendous electronic
impulse can be imparted

  he stepped to a corner of the room and wheeled
into position a squat carriage from which a heavily
insulated cable ran back to a special socket in the
wall upon the carriage rested a box-shaped piece
of apparatus the size of a large trunk which
stevens referred to as a neo-split-wave radio trans-
mitter

  its just the reverse of the heterodyne principle
you know he explained it steps the wave down
as far as we want it and we do need a very short
wave to compete with and surpass the gamma rays
of radium now were ready he said focusing the
wave director toward an almost invisible loop aerial
on the receptor and adjusting his controls

  six and eighty two hundredths of a second


amazing stories

should be sufficient exposure he remarked setting
the electric split-second automatic stop

  stand back please

  as the little group moved slightly to one side of
the path of the ray stevens closed the primary cir-
cuit of the transmitter

  a weird horrific screech filled the room as
though an invisible twentieth century limited ex-
press train had applied its brakes suddenly to
screaming steel rails all the jinnis of hell to-
gether could hardly equal the terror of it thought
mason

the swan song of a vacuum tube

and then silence descended broken only by
the faint rattling tinkle of broken glass fall-
ing somewhere inside the box on the carriage

  steveus smiled

  that was the swan-song of the transmitting
tube tubes always collapse under the strain when
used for a full exposure we exhaust their three
years of possible usefulness in a few hectic sec-
onds and their elements shriek in protest as they
disintegrate

  hurray interrupted johnssen bring the
slide back before our subject freezes to death ill
have to warm it with a light bath and give it
oxygen

  the slide was immediately and deftly transferred
back to its seat under the microscope lens and
treated to a bath of light directed at it laterally and
the cover glass lifted for an instant

  you shall be the first to look gary directed
doctor santurn i think you know from observa-
tion how to focus the microscope it is simply the
old type worked out to almost absolute perfection

  masons eyes were affixed to the stereoscopic at-
tachment the milli-vernier adjustment screw turn-
ing slowly between his fingers

  back and forth back and forth he turned the
adjustment screw raising and lowering the tube
columns until the field cleared then masons hand
drew slowly away from the super-microscope

  he gave a startled cry

  good god oliver somethings moving skim-
ming about here and there in the drop of fluid it
cant be-its impossible

  is it asked the doctor testily i thought you
inspected every step of the process yourself

  i did-i did cried mason excitedly still watch-
ing the unicellular bit of life moving about in its
element only this- he turned and looked at the
silent group with his arms stretched to them ap-
pealingly

  this is no hoax gentlemen it isnt an elaborate
farce at my expense its true is it

  one by one they gravely nodded affirmation of
the genuineness of what he had seen and at last
he faltered a little and breathing with difficulty
turned to the doctor

  i-im not well oliver id like to rest a bit
this thiiig has struck me all of a heap

more scientific miracles told of

it seemed incredible to mason that only twenty-
four hours earlier he had been seated with the
proprietor of the travelers hotel in the vil-
lage laughing and conversing light-heartedly over

the whimsical absurdities suspicions and super-
stitions of the natives as related by the host

  that was another world another existence as far
as the poles away from this atmosphere of deadly
calm fixity of purpose with the destruction of man-
kinds beloved and familiar beliefs as its goal

  again in the library resting from the shock of
what he had witnessed in the laboratory mason sat
tete-d-tste with the biologist and listened with
strained absorption to his friends remarks
friend im not certain thought mason

  what you saw performed this evening the
doctor was saying was the achievement of a goal
we have already reached by a slightly different and
easier method you saw a single cell created we
have gone further-much further

  every one of the fish and mammals in john-
ssens care was born in a similar manner only we
didnt create them cell by cell we merely obtained
the unfertilized fish roe or reptilian eggs or mam-
malian ova from various private aquaria and zoo-
logical collections all over the country wherever a
female specimen had freshly expired or been killed

  it is easier to start with the unfertilized primary
cell actuate it in the laboratory and permit its
gestation and growth thereafter in a natural man-
ner

  again-we have gone beyond even this we
know the composition of the eggs and ova of more
than fifty varieties of organisms we have dupli-
cated them successfully and actuated them with
vibratory impulses equivalent to the fertilization
and germination processes of nature we con-
trol the sex at will by limitation of the chromosomes
of the primary cell in most respects this method
is the simpler of the two we have worked out

  the other method of which you saw an ex-
ample tonight is a step toward creating the individ-
ual tissues of the grown body we have already
duplicated the main or parenchyme elements of
several varieties of connective tissue-namely
areolar fibrous elastic reticular and the like

  blood however presents a difficult problem and
is taking longer to duplicate because of the various
cellular elements in it which exist in changing pro-
portions were getting there though

  and if you do asked mason hanging on each
word of the highly technical description of the
doctors work

  and when we do you should have said re-
joined doctor santurn

  when we do he continued well use the hu-
man ovum now in johnssens incubator and ar-
tificially create a human being

  damn your matter-of-fact confidence thought
mason

  just now resumed the doctor we want to be
able to duplicate every variety of human blood we
encounter in order to prepare for any emergency
we may encounter that may arise after the birth
of our subject transfusion for instance

  mason shivered slightly

a discussion in theology

in his reverent delving into the archives of the
past midst african sand dunes and buried
greek and roman cities he had come across the
records of unspeakable practices horrific and re-
blasphemers plateau



volting but never had he sensed so sinister an aura
as that which surrounded the quiet-voiced mild-
mannered scientist who droned of his hopes and ac-
complishments

  if only he had the desire to dedicate his brilliant
discoveries to the cure of disease to the alleviation
of suffering to the elevation of mankind and the
glory of god

  but no his purpose was to render null and void
all that had inspired faith in spiritual reality since
the dawn of human life on the earth

  your work is monstrous oliver he said

  no matter how good your intentions may be you
are preparing to foist on humanity something that
they will abominate

  doctor santurn spoke with a tinge of sarcasm in
his voice which was pitched slightly higher and
sounded somewhat strained

  since when are you a moralist gary

  since this very moment oliver youll knock
the props from under civilization and offer cold
consolation in return the sort of immortality you
believe in is no solace to the average man even if
your theories are entirely correct-which i am not
prepared to admit

  stuff and nonsense do you really suppose if
you should die this minute youd go to a here-
after clad in celestial habiliments but still appear-
ing your present age-wrinkles bald spot and all
have you ever thought seriously of it gary what
age would you be if you died and went to heaven
would you dwell through infinity agelessly await-
ing gabriels saxophone to clothe yourself again in
the mortal clay you had left behind

 you wouldnt find it gary not on resurrection
day youd find that while you had strayed off na-
ture had borrowed some of your very material
molecules and employed them elsewhere in a moslj
useful manner

  then the only recourse left you if there should
be a you would be to appropriate unto yourself
the oriental belief in reincarnation find yourself a
new organism about to be born and crawl into
swaddling clothes for a new start-perhaps as a
sacred cow or a cat

  stuff and nonsense gary how could you bring
yourself expediently to believe in a heathen doc-
trine

  stop-stop it cried mason feeling as if some
roiling hand had stirred up the mud of doubt on
these very questions which had always secretly
troubled him

  on the other hand went on the doctor a
though mason had not spoken consider these bene-
fits men and women born free of any taint-
physically free from blemish and psychologically
exempt from the age-old inhibitions and fears that
hamper them to-day religion is responsible basic-
ally for most of these psychic handicaps

  will they all be soulless automatons inter-
rupted mason rallying again to the attack all of
one level of mediocrity or genius all with the
same tastes desires and capabilities

  granting your so-called benefits what becomes
of mans age-old desire for perpetuation in the
traits of his children what of his innate urge for
perpetuation after he ceases to walk among the liv-
ing

  instead of a soul you claim he becomes a com-
pletely damped impulse in the ether try and tell
men that and see whether reason or instinct pre-
vails 

  at your peril attempt to ram your brother-
hood of man scheme down their throats in the man-
ner you propose

  oh yes just try

  but the doctor merely laughed refused to be
drawn into further argument and prepared to re-
tire

a feeling of repulsion begins to grow

time stood still up there on the plateau and
the absence of newspapers even of calendars
had its effect on mason who lapsed quickly
into the routine of the place

  repelled by what he saw and heard yet never-
theless fascinated by each step forward in the mon-
strous work he spoke in a half-hearted manner of
taking his departure only to comply with the doc-
tors cynically veneered proposal that he stick it
out

  what he had witnessed during the first few hours
following his arrival had created within him a deep-
er repugnance than he had believed himself capable
of feeling gregarious by instinct tolerant of the
foibles and failings of the gemis homo and even
indulgent of some of them personally mason
brought to bear his best arguments to turn doctor
santurn aside from the accomplishment of what he
finally termed hellish desires

  the biologist had indulged in another of his mild
laughs at that but if he had proclaimed his inten-
tion at the top of his voice it could not have served
better to convince mason that wordy interference
would be futile

  for the first time the archaeologist became aware
of his own duality of nature ordinarily frank to
the utmost more comfortable as donor than as sup-
plicant there rose from his inner consciousness the
knowledge that he would travel devious and subtle
routes if need he to circumvent the doctor he was
no longer in doubt as to the mans ability to create
at will many varieties of organisms

  johnssens charges became more numerous day
by day and whatever had once been animated in the
laboratories on the plateau was jealously guarded
and nurtured

  each day had its definite assignment to be com-
pleted the schedule being laid down on the preced-
ing evening and as mason contributed an appar-
ently eager curiosity the doctor and his staff soon
grew used to his appearance in this laboratory or
that they even found amusement in directing him
to push this button or throw that switch and watch-
ing his amazement at the results

  they were playing with the higher science and
it is doubtful if they could have recalled the rudi-
mentary principles upon which their discoveries
were based so accustomed had they become to
manipulation of their super-devices and the per
formance of their intricate experiments

  on the surface mason was apparently reconciled
to the projects which he watched grow to fruition
from day to day within however his submerge
nature was slowly gaining the ascendency

  calm rational well-balanced mentally ordinarily


amazing stories

he nevertheless felt at times a desire to seize some
convenient bludgeon and smash-smash to atoms
these unbelieveable devices which were to bring
grief to mankind at such moments there seemed
to ring in his ears the cry

  sodom and gomorrah there are no righteous
here

masons mind begins to be affected by what
he has seen

had he been possessed of an explosive un-
der the stimulus of his hidden impulse he
might have been prompted to sacrifice
himself as a martyr for humanitys sake by reduc-
ing the laboratories and occupants into the particles
to which the doctor was so fond of referring
there was no opportunity for this however or
rather at best he might be successful in destroying
bridges laboratory alone for inflammable material
in bulk was stored there

  johnssens charges-especially the python and
the giant orang-came to mind as mason pondered
on the possibility of using them as active instru-
ments of mischief but no satisfactory method of
employing them as frankensteins occurred to him
he discarded the idea for while he might account
for the artificial specimens in the zoo and possibly
eliminate johnssen there would be left the other
laboratories and the doctor bridges and stevens
with whom to reckon to say nothing of suki and
either of the watchmen

  stevens the youngest of the scientists was pos-
sessed of so many likeable qualities despite his
sacreligious work that he was a thorn in masons
conscience when the thought of murder came to
him

  but again a voice seemed to cry in masons ear

  slay smight them hip and thigh spare not
one of the blasphemers 

  mason began spending much of his time in the
electro-physical laboratory where he came to be
accepted by stevens as a sincere searcher after
knowledge and as an intimate of his chiefs en-
titled to every courtesy and jonsideration

  soon stevens was permitting the older man to
assist in some of the work and as time fled by and
almost a month had elapsed since his arrival mason
came to acquire a fair working knowledge of the
operation of the equipment without in the least at-
tempting to ascertain the underlying principles

  as each step was checked up here stevens would
demonstrate to mason before presenting his findings
to the doctor

  you know he once remarked placing on the
laboratory table a live rabbit that had been snared
by one of the watchmen that what is true of a
theorem can often be demonstrated conversely for
instance if we can create by one method we should
be able to destroy by a diametrically opposite and
related method we have made blood of many var-
ieties with this neo-wave-generator

  it is equally possible to destroy the blood and
tissue elements by reversing the wave polarity by
means of this change-over switch

  this experiment is entre nous if you please i
dont think the doctor would altogether approve
but i should like to demonstrate to you what i
jnean

  observe this white rabbit-the fine shell-like
pink of its ears due to the coursing blood i am go-
ing to use a negative and reversed harmonic for
rabbits blood haemoglobin watch

  with mason behind him intent on his slightest
action he closed the circuit with the director
focused on the rabbit

instantaneous production of anemia by rays

the loud metallic screech now familiar to
mason commenced and ceased almost in-
stantly and now the rabbit gained his at-
tention

  to his amazement he saw its pinkish ears grow
paler blanch to an opaque white to the white of a
fishs belly-to leprous white the animal seemed
to shrink slightly to breath with difficulty all with-
in the compass of a minute

  the subject announced stevens in a satisfied
manner is dying of pernicious anaemia at least
i have employed a ray destructive to haemoglobin-
the red blood cells if you were to take a specimen
of this rabbits blood over to bridges he could
show you under his microscope that practically all
the red blood corpuscles had been destroyed id
rather youd take my word for it and refrain from
asking him as this side line is a little secret of my
own

  not again was mason permitted to view a demon-
stration of the powers of the destructive wave but
his eyes wandered often to the wave-changing de-
vice on the switchboard of the transmitter as
stevens busied himself with innumerable tasks

  another week elapsed during which time the con-
certed efforts of the scientists were devoted to a
duplication of the various principal cells of the
nervous system and brain they worked with amaz-
ing speed and accuracy did these men

  it wouldnt do gary doctor santurn re-
marked to bring that human ovum to life next
month only to have it turn out an imbecile i am
going to make sure therell be the nucleus of a
sound brain within its cranium after we bring it
into being

  mason smiled despite the impulse to rend and
tear

  he could not however look into the doctors eyes
for fear of disclosing his true feelings as he mur-
mured false phrases of approbation

  mason had learned to dissimulate

the horror of it all grows

w orn and haggard from the conflict of
forces which raged within him the elderly
archaeologist gave up all thought of the
outer world his every desire centering on ac-
complishing the destruction of the work and work-
ers of the plateau laboratories

  he almost screamed aloud in horror at the arti-
ficial birth of the baby which took place in doctor
santurns main laboratory a month later

  the ovum which had been subjected to activating
treatment under the ray months before and had
been in johnssens incubator all this while was
now a full-term foetus and needed but the final ex-
posure to the action of the ray to bring to life a
lustily bawling youngster

before johnssen with almost maternal solid-
blasphemers plateau



tude rushed it off to its incubator-the same as a
matter of fact that the orang had once occupied-
doctor santurn examined it carefully

  with an air of disappointment he finally turned
to his assistants and remarked there has been
some slight error of calculation the infant is a
cretin we shall be delayed with its brain develop-
ment until we have subjected it to radio-glandular
therapy for a while

  then against his inner loathing to be present on
several succeeding occasions mason had witnessed
the delicate treatments which transformed the hid-
eous creature into a seraphic-faced physically per-
fect specimen of babyhood-like the forced growth
of some ugly bulb under hothouse methods into a
blooming orchid of rare beauty

  doctor santurn however would not declare him-
self satisfied until he should have implanted a sec-
tion of brain tissue into the childs cranium for
subjection to rapid growth by means of neo-wave
stimulation

  mason had by now passed the bounds of rational
reasoning which might have led him to perceive the
valuable by-products of the biologists experiments
the means for eradicating many of the woes and
much of the suffering of the peoples of the world
he nursed his fear assiduously on the doctors
oft-repeated statement that he meant to use his dis-
coveries not as a relief measure for miserable
humanity but to destroy their erroneous be-
lief in the divinity of creation and in spiritual
immortality

  helplessly desperately mason strove to stem the
tide of this blasphemy but no opening presented it-
self for favorable action by him

  a bit of the doctors irony recurred to him again
and again

  in commenting on the birth of the child john-
ssen had said we ought to name it

  and doctor santurn head bowed in deep thought
for a few moments had looked up and replied

  we shall call it macduff like his namesake he
was not born of woman

playing with a human mind

a mild indian summers evening in late sep-
tember was declared favorable by doctor
santurn for the final brain treatment that
should transform macduffs mentality from medi-
ocrity to precocity	
mason stood by in sterile garb and watched the
preparations that centered about the anterior fon-
tanelle of the infants cranium

  trembling hardly daring to speak for fear of be-
traying his emotion he managed to subdue his ex-
citement and asked to be allowed to participate in
the experiment

  ah gary im delighted to see you running up
the white flag at last after all your opposition i
knew youd come around in time to the proper way
of thinking if i kept you here long enough stev-
ens  kindly set the controls for friend mason and
well have him close the circuit that will make of
this infant a genius

  grouped on either side of the swaddled infant
intent on its proper placement by johnssen stood
the doctor and his assistants they instinctively

moved back a step through force of habit as stev-
ens called ready

  quite ready croaked mason standing by thei
controls he would have to work rapidly with the
thirty six seconds of exposure which the apparatus
was set to deliver

  go called the doctor intent on the prone in-
fant

  a metallic shriek pierced the quiet of the domed
room as mason threw on the current and drowned
the slight click of another device on the switch-
board which he suddenly shifted without having
been bidden to touch it

  with desperate haste he pivoted the wave gen-
erator raised its focus and swept it slowly across
the heads of the unsuspecting group that stood ap-
parently intent on macduff

  his actions had been accomplished within fifteen
seconds and then with a sob mason broke the cir-
cuit with a hand switch and let quiet fall again 
the laboratory

  had he failed

  he did not know as he peered intently fearfully
at the immobile faces of the scientists they stood
so quietly-almost like petrified men

  he shrank back in terror as the doctor raised his
head suddenly and pointed an accusing finger a
him

  gary said the doctor bitingly you have
abused the most sacred canon of hospitality in
planning the destruction of your hosts dont at-
tempt to deny it he barked as mason raised 
trembling hand

  if we had been in proper relation to the recep-
tor wed have been idiots by this time the ray
you directed at us would have destroyed our brain
tissues youve been carefully watched you bigoted
would-be murderer despite the fact that you ap-
peared to be free from observation

  mason still white and shaken was stung to re-
tort by the sharpness of the doctors tone

  hospitality be hanged when humanitys happi-
ness is at stake id do it again if i had the
chance

  you would asked doctor santurn his voice
silken with an ominous threat

  assuredly

  then listen to this 

  a few whistled notes issued forth incongruously
from the lips of the elderly scientist

  do you recognize the quaint little air gary its
from gilbert and sullivans mikado to refresh
your memory ill quote the words to make the
punishment fit the crime the punishment fit the
crime

  he paused for a moment to let his meaning im-
press itself on masons mind and then continued

  in simple unadulterated english my good man
youve asked for a taste of your own medicine he
nodded to his assistants

almost a riot in the laboratory

there was a wild threshing and straining and
heaving of bodies as mason fought to evade
his captors he reviled and cursed them and
spat in their faces as they secured him to the table
from which the infant macduff had been tenderly
removed finally when he perceived the futility of


amazing stories

struggling further he lay quietly and just before
they focused the transmitter on his head he prayed
aloud not for deliverance but for the destruction
of his captors

  stevens had replaced the disrupted tube with a
liew one and the horrendous screech that now arose
as he closed the circuit seemed almost to have some-
thing human in its terrible protest

  within a quarter of an hour from the timehe had
attempted the lives of the scientists gary mason
the one-time brilliant archaeologist had become met-
amorphosed into an adult with the mentality of a
three year old child-a sleepy child at that doc-
tor santurn called for suki to put him to bed

  now gentlemen he said to his dishevelled as-
sistants science can proceed unhampered by fan-
atics it is perhaps fortunate that our guest knew
nothing of the mines placed under our buildings
nor of the bombs charged with bridges gas which
is as deadly as lewisite our knowledge is to be
devoted to one great purpose and rather than let
our achievements fall into the hands of lily-livered
gentry who might convert it to their own maudlin
aims i repeat our pledge to destroy should it be-
come necessary the plateau and all it houses re-
member i-- he paused his face distorted

by a spasm of pain

  swiftly he ripped his surgeons gown from his
body and bared his torso to the gaze of his startled
assistants

  what do you see bridges he asked in a low
tone of alarm quick

  bridges pressing his own face as if in pain
peered intently at the doctors neck

  theres a peculiar enlargement under the angle
of the jaw he said why its swelling as i
watch i

  qqickl trace down the lymph nodes in the
neck the doctor commanded his face contorted

  bridges did so swelling too he announced
theyre like marbles its almost like-i should
say like-

  go on man

  like metastasis in cancer when the infection
spreads

  good lord blurted forth stevens inconsis-
tently calling on one he had long scorned we
never thought these currents would act like x-rays
simple high frequency whod have thought-

dr santurn acknowledges defeat

tl tnamn your ignorance said the doctor
 bitterly ordinarily cancer takes up to a
couple of years to kill and here youve
saddled me with an unknown hothouse variety thats
killing me in minutes you gaping fools havent
you ever heard of the cumulative effect of roentgen
rays and radium rays well now you know the
neo wave is similar oh yes now youll know
mark you my lads im going fast and i know it
but youll follow soon yourselves

  you johnssen whatre you looking at on
your arm whats the trouble with your face
bridges nose seems badly off center hi stevens
you blighted nincompoop do your feet hurt
poor trilbys he laughed ironically

  with faltering steps he dragged his pain-wracked
body to the far corner of the room and pressed
against the wall next a hexagonal panel set in-
visibly in the tiles

  bridges was running about like one blinded
futilely wringing his hands

  johnssen gazed with terrible fixety at his fore-
arm feeling the chain of nodes that were swelling
up to the arm pit

  and stevens was crying frankly and unashamed-
ly as he clutched at his ankle

  boys said the doctor in a sibilant whisper
were beaten we have no remedy for this sort
of venom it wed have studied diseased tissues for
the sake of humanity as our friend mason might
say thered be a fighting chance for us oh well
it was fun while it lasted but somethings beaten
us

  something is there a something

  the hexagonal panel was open and deep into the
recess in the wall the doctor inserted his arm sum-
moning his waning strength he managed by a
tremendous effort to force a raucous croak through
his contracted larynx

  auotis mes enfants he called to the heedless
trio absorbed in their own separate purgatories
a short life and a merry one

  his arm sunk to the shoulder in the wall recess
turned slowly

the lim-keepers last words

the proprietor of the travelers hotel in the
village growing talkative occasionally to
some favored guest these days may point to-
ward the plateau just as nightfall enshrouds it
and describe it as a place beloved of the devil

  nothing but ruins are standing there since the
night of the big explosion he explains

  two men who went up to investigate dropped
in their tracks the moment they entered the gate
and the rest of us at a distance held back a good
ways no one ud dare go near the place finally
the war department sent an expert he said the
plateau was chock full of some sort o poison thatd
settled down and blighted everything nothing can
live there for years says he

  so we went and put up a high wall with plenty
of warning signs clear around the old wall but
taint necessary really ha try an get some one
who knows to go there for lover money

  would you like to explore he asks pointedly
where no green grass grows nor no vines cover the
ruins where birds never rise no more once they
light there sure you wouldnt the place is
damned and haunted i tell you

  and then the genial proprietor grows thought-
ful

  there was a kind of elderly fellow stopped here
on his way up there most a year ago said his
friend up there on the plateau was perfectly all
right and aboveboard i wonder what happened to
that there feller

  he shivers slightly

  lets go in an turn on the light he suggests

continued from page 

with a loud report we were already in the rare up-
per air and the friction of our swift rush through
it had begun to inflame the steel

  in a few moments more i thought i could throw
open a window and let in fresh air to revive jack
and to restore my own strength

  but alas i jack was already beyond all help when
i had opened the window and drawn one refreshing
breath i turned to him and found him pulseless

  it is a wonder that i did not go mad myself i
had brought the car almost to rest and now it slowly
settled until it lay motionless i was at home at last
j-but what a home-coming

  long i sat discouraged and desperate with bitter
thoughts and jack lying there before me finally
a soft breeze stealing into the open window roused
me

  the electric lights were glowing in the car but
as  opened the door i found that it was night out-
side i turned back and looked once more at jack

  he lay as peaceful as a sleeping child i could
bear it no longer i turned off the light and
emerged from the car

  it had landed in a swamp straggling trees cov-
ered with wild grape-vines were all about

new york again

heedless of where i went i began to run
several times i fell headlong but recovering
my feet went on after several hours i found a
hunters deserted hut and entered it tired out
i lay down there and slept until the morning sun
awoke me

  it is needless to detail all that followed

  i found out that the car had come down in the
very heart of the adirondack wilderness i occu-
pied a whole day in walking to an inhabited clearing
when i arrived there i had made up my mind what
to do i would keep the secret

  as soon as i could reach new york i hunted up
church his amazement upon seeing me was bound-
less he had long believed that we were all dead
but he agreed with me to keep the secret together
we went to the adirondacks found the car after a
weeks search buried jacks body under a great
pine tree and labored for two whole days to sink
the accursed car forever from the sight of men in
the mud of the swamp

  now at last i have told the story and the world
knows what a genius it lost in edmund stonewall

 against an amazing back-
ground of a mechanical-elec-
trical and chemically altered
life of mankind there is set
a brilliant and colorful ro-
mance in the life of the
greatest living scientist of
that age

  ralphs love for the beauti-
ful stranger his conquest of
his rival and the worsting of
the great saturnine martian
culminating in a running
fight in space with tragedy
and terror conquered by al-
most unbelievable and in-
credible weapons make one
of the most interesting and
gripping stories ever told

 

years

in  mr hugo gernsback editor of amazing stories
published the first radio magazine the world had even seen
-modern electrics in one of these volumes he ran a
story entitled ralph c  a romance of the year
 this story although written many years ago proved
more valuable as the years went by because many of the
prophecies made in this book gradually came true

  this was in the days before broadcasting had even been
thought of and before we had the radio telephone yet all of
this is faithfully chronicled in this story

  old-time readers of modern electrics probably remember
the story and now have a chance to get the complete book

  a pioneer in the electrical and radio field mr gernsback
has a profound knowledge of the subjects coupled with a finely
trained and highly imaginative mind

  this unusual combination has enabled him to foreshadow
with almost unbelievable accuracy some of the more recent
developments his earlier predictions which have appeared
from time to time during the past decade in many newspapers
and magazines are now realities every prophecy is based on
accurate scientific knowledge his ideas are no more fantastic
than the realities and commonplaces of our everyday life would
have been to our great grandfathers

 back the sun and dropped the object
 at his feet thats a loaded revolver
 said he montgomery here will do
 the same now we are going up the

 why did you set-your people on

   we felt sure of catching you and

 then i remembered something again

 and talk we cant do anything more

 felt i understood

 thinking and added holding your
 hands up

   cant do that said montgomery
 with an explanatory nod over his
 shoulder undignified

    go up to the trees then said i as
 you please

   its a damned silly ceremony said
