mr bixby

dennis strong see vizigraph march  is undoubtedly

a remarkable man he is so remarkable that i find it almost un-
believable that he can be so upset by the moronic mouthings of so
inconsequential a lot of unjailed juvenile delinquents

every semi-sober reader of sf has at some time or another
been mildly irritated by the bem school of letter-writing but few
of us have flipped our wigs in so undignified a fashion as mr
strong has

 mr strong is however a brilliant character and analyst any
 man who can deduce the cultural educational and intellectual lev-
 els of the several members of a geographically disparate group of
 letter writers is at least a crystal-gazer and at best a genius-m
 either case a potentially useful citizen

 mr strong considers these parasitical dilettantes equivalent
 to a hole in the head of the body sf he says they have nothing to
 give to sf what does mr strong have to give what have i
 to give we all give the same tiling our support

 it is true that the lunatic fringe is always with us those of us
 with variegated interests are familiar with more types of cliques
 but they are all somehow the same a source of embarrassment
 to the true believer perhaps mr strong and i are members ot
 the same coterie the anti-cult cult

one thing which the childswarm has given to sf is the phenom-
enon called the fanzine i dont know much about fanzines out
they represent a rare tribute to the writers of sf

when mr strong has time i wish he would brief me on literary
form especially the novel and mr strong next time you see an
asterisk and exclamation-point riddled letter in the vizltikajrii
sniff twice and ignore it for the sake of your hypertension

                                                 sincerely

lubec maine

dear jerry

  may i have a page or two to discuss the letter
of dennis strong which appeared in the march
 issue of planet thanks

  every once in a while one of these high and
mighty characters turns up to show us how su-
perior and intelligent he is all the while malign-
ing everyone else this puzzles me why should
any person start discussing in such a manner
something he knows little or nothing about
unless it be for the above mentioned reasons

  this strong character no pun intended
seems to lack an understanding of the basic
workings of the average american in any group
of people interested in the same specialized form
of work entertainment etc there is bound to
be a dialectic deviation from the kings english
it is to be found everywhere such as among
amateur radio operators the armed services
musicians lumbermen and so on why not
among s-f devotees also then humor is one
of the basic characteristics of our people or of
any human fans being like any other human
have a sense of humor and- use it and being
sort of clannish as would be hams it is often
understood only by them because of the fiction
they read imaginative fiction and imaginative
minds combine to make such a thing as ken
beales worple and its use funny only to fans
and whats wrong with that

  of course anything can be overdone this
humor sometimes is but there has been a notice-
able cut-down both on the part of the letter-
writers and the editors request then we have
your cultist leanings  is this supposed to
refer to dianetics yet

  then there is the matter of commenting on
the stories and artwork in the first place mr
strong it is a basis of democracy that one man
can comment freely about any subject he de-
sires as long as he doesnt violate the other mans
rights fans happen to make use of this right
especially since it is the policy of most s-f pub-
lications to request such comments for publica-
tion and consideration most readers have read
stf for many years and cant help but gain some
little knowledge of the writing of science-fiction
not being trained critics we cant always write
flawlessly accurate criticisms of each story but
in most cases the writer usually knows whereof
he writes authors sometimes request such opin-
ions privately from fans so it cant all be
drivel

  here and there you make direct reference to
names sometimes this could be actionable how-
ever this is merely a case of self-centered igno-
rance it so happens that you mr strong dont
know rick sneary and why his letters appear
as they do i must say that he makes a lot more
sense than you do when he writes a letter you
dont knorv redd boggs and all the others you
merely know how to write insults founded on
your own ignorance of other human beings
this certainly strikes me as being a case of
sour grapes at least and of course only you
understand ray bradburys writings

  a peak of ignorance on your part is the im-
polite way you refer to the name of isaac asi-
mov every man has the right to respect for his
name and it is only reasonable in polite society

for a man to wish that his name be spelled cor-
rectly it is therefore very poor form and also
betrays little intelligence on your part to author
that last paragraph it reminds me of a punished
childs attitude after his censuring parent has
left hitn standingn the corner

  this is about fall i care to stomach of mr
strongs letter i am sure others will cover it
more thoroughly than i and probably more
competently

  f id like to make a comment or two on the maga-
zine itself before i close so if you will   

  the last few issues have maintained the par
for enjoyability and i have noted and welcomed
the many additions and improvements longer
stories such as craigs witch of the de-
mon seas and la bracketts black ama-
zon of mars hold to the line of competent
space-adventure to be found in each issue of ps
at least i liked them shorter stories such as
langs guest expert andersons duel
on syrtis and oberfields poison plan-
et exemplify the growing quality of the short
stories addition of such authors as horace fyfe
and van vogt are notable and welcome i also
applaud the addition of paul orban to your art
staff his drawing for van vogts story in the
march issue showed more pep than a lot of his
work has in a long time cartier also welcome
the reprint was not though the story was good
but the idea of reprints isnt the revival of the
feature flash also welcome nothing like read-
ing the authors own words about himself shows
what human and regular guys they are every-
body pro or fan that ive ever met always
made that impression on me

  lastly give the awards to ken beale joe
gibson and stanley nathanson for best letters
or at least they appealed to me in that order
dennis strong should get some sort of bravery
award i suppose well jerry i didnt burn the
midnight oil but i bet this comes close to dead-
line time

                             yours sincerely

ed cox

dear mr bixby

  whether you know it or not i owe you a let-
ter planet was the first science-fiction magazine
i ever read and i want to congratulate you
first on the vast improvement over that spring
 issue which introduced me to stf ive seen
arrays of name authors on cover pages before
and been disappointed by the stories but your
men really came through

  i liked andersons star ship a few issues
ago but duel on syrtis topped it well
see more of him i hope i cant say anything
about reprints that hasnt already been said es-
pecially since you printed such an excellent one
but mark me down as against when the votes
come in by guided missile no doubt with proxi-
mity fuse attached

  its a funny thing about raymond galluns
stories since they deal with ordinary people and
their reaction to abnormal or normal future if
you prefer stimuli they are the exception to the
usual run of emperors scientists and galaxy-
continued on p 
as usual hawk stevens
was in a foul mood the fact that
johnny single his old school buddy
from decimal point and the man who had
crossed him five years ago and married
madge had just come aboard ship to see
him didnt improve the mood he arose
from the cot where he was sprawled
studied himself in a fly-specked mirror as
he rubbed slowly at a two-days growth
of beard yeah thats you hawk stevens
owner and captain of a stinking four-jet
rotor ship cutthroat boss of a crew of



the king hawk stevens skip pet
of the slave-ship selwyn the
pawn john-boy single who had
stolen hawks woman the cov-
ered bishop corpin the pious
shrewdly planning mutiny with
a rum-belly space-rat crew they
blasted off to strip far andrigo
of its gentle people   

by	

ross rocklynne

slave ship to andrigo

	planet

cutthroats madge should see you now-
slaver

  he shrugged a derelict blue officers coat
over ox-like shoulders brushed back inky
hair that curled disreputably about his
ears and touched at his backbone all in
all he had a bickford look curved short
nose savage lips and tufted inky brows
shadowing small deep eyes of indeterminate
color

  when johnny single came in a moment
later hawk thought with cynical satisfac-
tion slave-bait  the thought had an
overtone that was crueller than usual
hawk felt a bitter resentment at singles
seeing him as he was not as he had been
an object of hero-worship but when he
held out his hand johnny singles naive
expression was one of brightening pleas-
ure

  you remembered me quinn after all
these years

  john-boy i dont forget my good
friends

  if you can still consider me your
friend said single wryly after the ruck-
us five years ago

  a stab went through hawk dont men-
tion that john-boy

  but i want to mention it quinn
madge-

  i said forget it hawk snapped

  single met his glare quietly five years
before single would have quailed before
that tone and those words but those days
were over johnny single had grown up
changed maybe still in awe of quinn who
was hawk now but still unwilling to be
kicked around by a bigger guy

  hawk went on in the peremptory tones
and forget that quinn stuff its hawk
now-hawk stevens bird of prey with his
bloody talons outstretched

  i dont believe that hawk said single
quietly

  youll believe it johnny it isnt like
it was when we were both at the space
academy-at decimal point about the
worst sin you saw me commit then was
cribbing from your exams

  johnny smiled or threatening to knock
hell out of me if i didnt write your term
papers

  for a moment they stood lost in those

stories

thoughts then hawk moved heavily be-
hind his desk where the cruel harsh lines
of dissipation were smoothed out by the
relative shadows cast by the barrier of
brilliance from his desk lamp

  so what can i do for you single 
hawk was cold distant single instantly
realized the change of status he had un-
dergone hawk added deliberately look-
ing for a job arent you

  single started hawd you know
you can always tell hawk said
cryptically

  yeah you could always tell that loolc
if it was in some barfly at plutos univer-
sal joint or in a vice-president given a
prattfall by some ambitious double-cross-
ing subordinate

single relaxed slowly drew out
a cigarette offered hawk one okay
-hawk im looking for a job when i
graduated i took the easy way out in-
stead of getting into astrogation like you
did i worked at an engineering job in my
fathers company asteroid steel it got
caught in the panic ive been knocking
around from one thing to another for six
months ive found out one thing-that
you have to start down low to work up to
the astro-marine fleet

  hawk winced in spite of himself un-
intentional or not the shot told so thats
the reason you came to me to start down
low

  thats one of the reasons forget the
other for the time being

  hawks broad hands were pressing hard
on the desk he hated the moment johnny
single had come back into his life again
with all its subtle connotations he hated
johnny single-or he hated himself he
wasnt sure which

  he said harshly ft can give you a job
single it wont be what you expect but
its a job and you can knock around the
ship a bit during the trip ill hire you as
emissary single-an emissary to the
greenies

singles mouth opened in bewilderment
hawk said take it or leave it
oh ill take it of course single said
hurriedly but how about explaining my
duties 
slave-ship to andrigo

  hawk made a show of being pressed for
time by studying his wrist chronometer

  were hitting heaven in less than an
hour he told single im going to be
jnisy every blasted minute getting my in-
subordinate crew to tuning up the stinking
rotors im going to assign you to a cabin
if you think you can get your things here
in time this time tomorrow come and see
me and ill give you the low-down fair
enough 

  single was stubbornly loath to be dis-
missed so abruptly you might tell me
who the greenies are at least he ob-
jected

  hawk said the greenies are a race of
plant-people inhabiting the planet andrigo
used to be a civilized race-millions of
em in the last thousand years climatic
change has played hell with their culture
at present theyre in danger of dying off
well single were headed for andrigo
purpose to save a few hundred greenie
lives satisfied

  well- said single then he gave up
said wearily okay hafrk save it till lat-
er-and ill take the job

  another thing hawk called after him
s he reached the door dont mix with
the crew unless you can give it back to
them double theyve got a natural aver-
sion to decimal pointers me included

  single went out and hawk said hook-
ed

  actually hawk didnt have any immedi-
ate chores except to relay orders to the
blasted steward of this junk-heap to quar-
ter single but the main factor in hiring
so-called emissaries or slave-bait was
to get them to accept the job without
really knowing what it was all about once
they were out in space on the way to
andrigo single wouldnt dare to question
the standard lie too much-merely as a
matter of saving his own self-respect

  of course sooner or later he would
learn that hawk was using him again this
time to trap greenies so hawk and his
men could transport them back to the
slave-market on eros hed probably flip
his lid but all the emissaries got a bit
hard to handle then

  and after all single was the man who
had double-crossed him and married

madge when exposure came hawks
conscience naturally wouldnt bother him
naturally not

hawk awoke sputtering as s-
sion-engitieer corpins voice came
through the audio all right stow it
hawk growled staggering to the instru-
ment

  corpin in the same monotonous voice
informed hawk that the crew was stand-
ing by to cut in the a-motors the course
was set by the stars traffic was cleared
from the skies above the port and the
rotors were heating for eccentric gear

  ill take it growled hawk stand
by

  while he was relaying orders into the
proper channels corpin spoke again his
voice changed to an unctuous drawl that
rolled out of his fat throat

  i understand youre using one of your
friends as slave-bait this time

  both hawks fists crashed down on the
board

  as if unaware of this reaction corpin
continued blandly i met single a very
decent god-fearing lad if im any judge
now his tone was a lugubrious long-
suffering down-beat just between you and
i hawk he mourned i hope he heps
to this ratty game before he loses god
like the rest of us and theres an awful
lot of god out in space where he lives

  a curious blend of panic and fury bur-
geoned in hawk throwing caution to the
winds he ignored frantic signal lights

  he snarled and theres a lot of god
in the brig too corpin if you feel like
communing    talk corpin talk thats
all youre good for talk listen you
cant run slaves to the market and try to
square yourself with god at the same
time

  you can try said corpin the
pious as he was known to some he
added mournfully you might even suc-
ceed

  there was an uplift to the last word that
betrayed he was secretly delighted hawk
had let himself be goaded into an argu-
ment

  the winking signal lights caught hawks
eyes at last savagely he completed the
i	planet

set of relays the fission motors charged
into life created instantaneously hundreds
of cubic feet of hot ionically lighted kryp-
ton gas which flared from the jets the
ship was awash with unbearable vibration
and sound then came the overpowering
odor of fission-krypton leaking from hope-
lessly pitted fission chambers on the
heavy-handed push of the rockets the s
s selwyn moved sluggishly into the sky

  hawk leaned low to the audio he was
perfectly aware that corpin had been bait-
ing him

  keep your fat slimy face out of my
way hereafter corpin im sick of that
pseudo-religious mush and ill pick any
blasted emissary i choose furthermore
you might as well know im perfectly
aware youve been trying to arrange a mu-
tiny among the men so you could take over
the selwyn a barrel ful of the men youve
approached are loyal to me any more con-
spiring and youll wind up in the brig
think it over

  before he could jam over the cut-off
corpin the pious said remorselessly wor-
riedly i dont know hawk i dont know
i figure you for one of those persecution
complexes

  his oily voice became confidential be-
tween you and i hawk ive jammed the
crew full of gods love theyre fond of
you hawk very fond   

johnny single awoke went
sleepily to the port space stars
emptiness nervous as a witch he dressed
what a fool hed been to ship out without
having the slightest idea what his job was
anxiety showing in his blue rather ingen-
uous eyes he left the cabin but instead of
going to hawks cabin he summoned his
nerve and went on an inspection tour of
the lower deck he padded quietly past
the bank of ten-ton rotors whose eccen-
trically geared action now superceded the
gas-thrust was hurling the egg-shaped
craft broadside on its course by a curious
subversion of newtons laws of motion

  hello emissary said a polite voice
single turned to look into a compartment
where a group of three men were grinning
at him single felt a bristling of that an-
tagonism cro-magnon must have felt for

stories

neanderthal these were hairy ape-men in
filthy clothing stained with red grease ac-
quired from the machine they were over-
hauling

  the one who had spoken showed a bank
of decayed teeth we was talking about
how happy we were to have a emissary
aboard at last you know we hung around
port a week before you come along hard
to get emissaries you have to be pure in
heart you know

  they grinned

the nervous fear in single increased
he summoned what boldness he could
what is an emissary he demanded

  the men tittered hear that said
one nudging the other the very fact
that he dont know makes him a real emis-
sary well he addressed single are you
pure in heart are you full of love of
charity are you meek and ready to in-
herit the planet andrigo answer aye and
youre an emissary the greenies will love
you like we do

  single faced them uncertainly then was
about to go on when two of the men rose
with a gliding motion one on either side
they grabbed him by the biceps the men
stank of fission-krypton they felt his
muscles

  see one chuckled hes got muscles
like cheese that means hes led a pure
sheltered life

  single lurched against them in sudden
blind fury whereupon one of the men re-
leased him yelled with supreme indig-
nation who you tryin to slug and
knocked him clear across the corridor with
a blow to the jaw single hung on the-
bulkhead groggily but his fury was un-
dimmed he staggered toward the blurred
shapes of his tormenters

  here here man whats going on
said a voice and a hearty hand wrapped
itself around singles upper arm oh for
the love of god said fission-engineer cor-
pin theres blood on your jaw

  these men attacked me said single
thickly he tried to lash out at the man
who was coming at him but corpin was
holding his arm he got it on the jaw again
and went down

  let me go sir he begged when cor-
pin hauled him erect ill settle this thing
slave-ship to andrigo



please let go my arm

  we are all men of firm religious be-
lief said corpin firmly there will be
no striking of brother against brother
single saw the third blow coming and
about the only thing he could do was duck
it it caught him glancingly and he drop-
ped to all fours and stayed there panting
while rosy mists drifted across his brain
after awhile corpin wrapped his fat arms
around him at the waist attempting to lift
him

  no sir said single ill stay down
here

  i did my best for you boy said cor-
pin in the most abject regret

  im sure you did sir said single
gasping as he came erect and staggered
down the corridor he finally brushed cor-
pin off corpin stood looking after him
and then suddenly called im sorry boy 
the three crewmen grinned at corpin
when he turned

  thanks for settin him up for us
capn

  i was trying to save the poor lad from
himself said corpin piously mind you
though no more of that after all we do
need emissaries in the slave-trade though
time was when we could dose the greenies
with a load of indele-acetic acid without a
murmur he sighed nostalgically and no
more of that calling me captain until the
fact is assured

  he walked off down the corridor how-
ever with the lordly manner of a man
who already owned the walls around him
-he that is and god he ascended
through three decks laboring under the
burden his fat bestowed on him and en-
tered his cabin as was his wont lie went
first to the port solemnly studying the
savannas of endless space tears filled his
eye

  lord lord he said in thy eyes i
stand a sinner

  he sat at his desk and heaving a sigh
drew a bottle from a lower drawer as he
poured he thought of johnny single such
a decent lad perfect for an emissary

hawks deep eyes hardly chang-
ed expression when single stood be-
fore him blood caking his jaw clotting his

white linen shirt well he said harshly
i told you not to mix with the crew
who mixed with them single de-
manded even at that i could have given
it right back to them but mr corpin tried
to stop it and kept getting in my way

  at this hawks laugh barked out he
didnt explain to single that corpin be-
sides being a religious hypocrite had sa-
distic tendencies that much should have
been obvious to anybody but-an emissary-
type single was certainly that

  single sat down heavily anyway
quinn loosen up those fellows made
some awfully funny cracks about emis-
saries and the pure in heart

  because thats what you are john-boy
pure in heart

  now youre calling me john-boy
again said single oddly

  hawk casually brought his legs up to
rest on a corner of the desk so that his
head tipped back out of the circle of light
blasted fool he told himself he said
blandly well youre my friend arent
you john-boy

  even though i married madge
hawks feet came down the metallic
heel-plates ringing against the legs of the
chair he half-rose face flat and dark
his great fist extended toward single then
he withdrew the fist as if by conscious ef-
fort and crumpled back in the chair on his
face appeared a small bitter smile

  good self-control hawk single said
eyeing him steadily madge would like
that-to know youve changed that much
what difference would it make said
hawk in a muffled tone dont bother
mentioning her again-or ever    you
want to know about the job i hired you
for single he could tell single any lie
now he felt justified in it ive helled
around the system for a good many years
but this was the first time the society ever
approached me for a mercy run to the
greenies lord i could have made ten
times as much profit running a cargo of
iridium to marsport

  he fell to brooding long enough for
single to get his cue

  mercy run said single curiously
what society

  sufrom hawk rattled off so-
	planet

ciety for the relief of minorities youve
heard of it one of the boys back at
decimal point wrote a monograph on it
some sort of stinking womans club organ-
ized it understand he jabbed a finger
at single im not the kind that goes for
handing out charity but the greenies are
different

  mercy run mused single as if the
idea was beginning to hit him but still had
a lot of puzzling aspects

  oh im not taking any credit for a
good act declaimed hawk pacing the
floor with gestures out of the corner of
his eye he noted singles growing interest
and more important an unmistakable
touch of the awe single had held for him
when they were at decimal point a devil
of delight came to hawk

  oh i wont claim it was out of any
humanitarian impulse john-boy he went
on say im getting paid for it and let
it go at that

  but youre not getting paid as much
for it as for some other run said single
intently

  well-no anyway-

most of the story was the
straight goods at that hawk told
it well after all a man could put him-
self in the shoes of the greenies if he had
any kind of heart they inhabited the
planet andrigo so far above the plane of
the ecliptic although near the sun that
it was out of the regular trade-routes
plant-people they were but superficially
humanoid an old race-maybe too old
-sedentary like all plants even though
they did have limbs but something had
happened in the evolution chain they were
dying off not only was the planet pro-
gressing slowly outward from the sun
over the centuries but one of those un-
predictable climatic changes had come over
the planet in the last thousand years from
a teeming civilization that covered the
planet they had dropped to a population
comprised of scattered isolated villages

  hawk carefully excluded the informa-
tion that much of the population decline
during the last twenty years was more or
less directly attributable to the outlawed
slave-trade that was strictly a hush-hush

stories

matter inasmuch as the high-pressure boys
millionaires and politicians bought green-
ies at high prices and used them as gar-
deners on their lush planetary estates
being plants themselves greenies had a
remarkable feeling for other growing
things of the plant class in an unsea-
sonably short time most enslaved greenies
died from adverse climatic and soil con-
ditions but you could always replace them
if you knew the right people and had
money

  i told you the greenies were still dying
off hawk said with all the earnestness at
his command botanists have laid the
blame to a lack of auxins plant hormones
control every factor of growth size and
longevity same as animal hormones do in
animals john-boy the main trouble is that
before the greenies reach the seeding stage
of growth their roots have all but stopped
growing they die before they can repro-
duce thats where i come in my cargo
this trip is a few dozen hogsheads of indele-
acetic acid the plant-hormone which stim-
ulates root-growth

  single was hanging attentively on every
word he smiled sheepishly you had me
fooled hawk when i saw you yesterday
i thought sure you were pretty far gone
in the ways of sin

  ive done some pretty stinking things
hawks broad shoulders squirmed with em-
barrassment but once in awhile a man
realizes he has to live with himself john-
boy in fact thats exactly the reason i
had to hire you as emissary pie squirmed
again his face was actually red and flush-
ed  sweat was pendant on his forehead he
was finding it harder to go on with the
blasted lie if only john-boy didnt have
the dewy shine of an idealist in his eyes
the same blasted hero-worship hed had
for hawk at decimal point

  hawk had to wrench his eyes away
its just that youre pure in heart john-
boy were not were rotten to the core
every one of us and the greenies can
sense that the minute they saw me or
anybody else on this ship-theyd scatter
like jack-rabbits and never come back to
their village even if we soaked the ground
in indele-acetic

  singles thoughtful comprehension was
slave-ship

manifest on his face hawk momentarily
closed his hot eyes the blasted lie was
oyer it had been an ordeal sure as hell

after three days twenty hours
plus in space the s s selwyn fluf-
fed to a spectacular landing on andrigo
coming straight down from the sun so the
greenies wouldnt be able to spot her in
that tremendous glare the horribly twist-
ed plants and withered trees of that pitiless
desert bent and were demolished as the
ship furrowed through the sand instantly
all was an orderly confusion as the amid-
ships gangway was let down and the
broad-tired planetruck with a truck-bed
as big as the floor of a large house was
yo-heave-hoed rolling from the ship then
the astromen went fast at the work of
loading her with hogshead after hogshead
of indele-acetic acid

  johnny single stood watching the pro-
ceedings were perfectly plain to him now
corpin waddled up to him all broad smiles
and happiness wearing a broad frigo-hat

  good luck single he said warmly
wringing singles hand you understand
how it is were spacemen rough pro-
fane really outlaws of the worse sort
being what they are the greenies can
spot it in a minute a sort of sixth sense
not that they can read your mind but
theyll see that youre pure in heart and
will accept the gift

  i understand sir said single uneasily
trying to draw away from the sweaty grip

  corpin pointed into the distant rising
sand-dunes oasis over there about ten
miles time was- he swept the territory
with his short arm-when all this was a
lovely green now its all changed who
he said piously can fathom the way of
gods mind not us mortals ah well
he sighed he fixed single with cow-like
eyes

  i wish i was young again son id
travel in the ways of god

  why dont you anyway sir said
single politely

  i try i try in my small way corpin
said complacently but we are all between
you and i victims of human failings
then his gaze wandered back to single a
trifle sharply you didnt mean anything

to andrigo	u

by that remark did you son his grasp
 singles arm tightened

  why what remark sir single tried
to get loose off to one side he saw some
of the crewmen grinning at him as they
worked

  that remark you made said corpin
drawing him closer until his eyes now
curiously molten were a few inches away
that i should move in the ways of god
you didnt overhear anything did you
son you arent thinking of crossing me
are you son

  i dont know what the hell you mean i
single wrenched free

  corpin stood back all right son i
believe you i want to tell you something
if you and hawk ever have a blow-off
come to me im your friend heavily he
plodded away adjusting his frigo-hat
against the sun hawk came in from
another direction strutting

  what was he doing getting at you
he demanded he muttered something pro-
fane when single told him then he slung
his arm around single dont worry
john-boy he said heartily you and ill
never have a blow-off

  yeah single said wryly thats the
way you used to talk to me when you
tried to get around me to do your papers
you always did have a way

  hawk felt a stab of alarm but ap-
parently single was only making talk for
he was looking off absently at the now
loaded truck

  i guess hawk said youd better be
on your way

  single drove off without a backward
look the heavily scored treads of the plane-
truck kicking up clouds of dusty sand in
the shallow gravity the truck rode easily
bound for the oasis where lived the tribe
of greenies

   single was all in all gloomy about his
mission he was scared stiff hawk might
be using him again stubbornly he reject-
ed the notion he was committed to this
course and had better sponge his mind of
doubt seeing that the greenies without
benefit of communication through regular
channels were strangely gifted in an ability
to sense disharmony

  he relaxed at the wheel
	planet

hawk corpin and several other
men stood atop the space-ship star-
ing tensely at the greenies village through
electronically amplified binoculars

  hawks dark face was grim with satis-
faction its working he said out loud
to the men grouped on the desert floor
the greenies are swarming around the
truck they havent run for it yet any-
way

  theyre hooked god rest their betray-
ed souls said corpin letting his eyes fill
with tears

  the distant scene assumed the terrible
proportions of out-size drama the village
concourse swarmed as the greenies were
drawn toward the fatal hormone at first
there was a sense of orderliness as the hogs-
heads were bunged containers brought
then the drinking commenced orderly too
at first then the action shifted to a blur-
red vista of green shapes insensibly im-
bibing

  hawk got a fix on single he was
sickened and disgusted- that much was
plain on his drawn face plainly he was
looking for a chance to back the truck
away

  god said corpin staying with his
obsession works in strange ways hawk
you wouldnt think hed make greenies
this stupid the poor souls if they have
souls

  god said hawk voice edged with
mimicry made plants to open wide their
leaves when it rained well its raining

  an hour later hawk figured the stage
was set in the distant village the men
haded into the other planetruck testing
the sharpness of their knives on the way
to the village the planetruck driven by
single came roaring from the opposite di-
rection the trucks came to a stop abreast
each other and single came jumping out
of the cab

  whats up he called catching hawks
eye

  hawk didnt answer the question he
said whats the idea bringing that plane-
truck back well need it he motioned
one of his men who took over the wheel
of singles truck backed it around and
set its blunt snout pointing toward the
village again

stories

   single looked baffled

  have any trouble hawk called gen-
ially but his eyes were cold unfriendly
slits

  not much said single naturally
they trusted me he grabbed hawks
ankle where hawk sat in the cab of the
planetruck at the wheel his eyes were full
of dumb misery listen quinn whats
the idea you dont want to go into that
village when theyre-when theyre-well
i was surprised the way it affected them
auxins may be what they need-they act-
ually grew roots while i watched but it
makes them-drunk theyre blinko

  yah emissary grinned one of the
men leaning over the railing

  tell me whats going on hawk
single said quietly he started climbing to
the fender but one of the men shoved
him off

  hawk said no rough stuff then he
brought deliberately cruel eyes back to
single at the acute misery which stared
back at him he experienced a wrench of
pure unexpected pain well he shouted
full into singles face did you expect
me to tell a sap like you the truth were
slavers john-boy slavers what else he
rammed in the starter and the planetruck
leaped ahead but johnny single was a-
board one terrific leap of fury had taken
him into the cab both arms around hawks
neck in a threshing heap hawk and sin-
gle tumbled from the leaping truck fell
just free of the grinding wheels hawk
felt himself curiously immobile as if rob-
bed of the will to defend himself he let
himself be hauled to his feet allowed
singles oncoming fist to connect with his
jaw his brain seemed to burst fancy the
kid having a punch like that he went
down

  single stood over him while the truck
stopped a hundred feet away disgorging
men who came running excitedly back
single shouted down at hawk in uncon-
trollable almost incoherent rage thats
it lie there let me kick you but it isnt
going to be that easy thinking you can
salve your conscience by letting me beat
you up

  he hauled the unresisting hawk erect
smashed him back down again hawk lay
slave-ship to andrigo



flat bleeding at the mouth while he watch-
ed the wild tears coursing from singles
eyes

  i told you i came to you for a job
quinn single choked i did but there
was another reason madge madge
madge madge she wanted you back
hawk stevens she sent me to see if you
were changed if that spark of decency
you used to have had grown to make you
somebody worthwhile she still loves you
quinn she didnt want me i just hap-
pened to be there when she had to get rid
of you yeah and you still love her i
can see it in your slimy eyes well now
ive got plenty to tell her quinn ill tell
her what a degenerate youve turned into
ill tell her theres nothing left-

  hawk stood up and felled him with a
blow

  get back in the trucks he ordered the
men get at it weve wasted enough
time

at the village the majority of
the greenies were already in their tor-
por fastened by swift-growing roots to
the earthen floors of their huts they sat
there like green dwarfs with delicate
fleshy appearing roots growing out of their
arm leg and shoulder joints some of the
younger greenies cavorted about the body
of men screaming threats but there
werent enough of them to put up any re-
sistance soon knives were flashing the
spacers were old hands at this game in
record time cut the greenies free from
their restraining roots loaded them eight
deep in the trucks when the village was
cleaned out hawk gave a deliberate coarse
laugh

  johnny single was right theres noth-
ing left a still dead voice agreed youve
lost madge-and you could have had her
well lose her good be a worse rat even
than john-boy thinks you are

  some distance away corpin the pious
watched hawk with mild interest he
nudged the spacer standing next to him

  hes beginning to break up its tellin
on him the last time we cut the greenies
-which was the first time for him-i
figured he was sick to his stomach now
hes got this madge to plague him every

strong man has his delilah

  maybe we better-

  cautiously cautiously corpin waved
the spacer quiet hawks still got a few
men on his side-let him have plenty of
time to turn even them against him ive
been waiting for some situation like this
the greenies had been locked in the
soil-cells and in his cabin hawk lay on his
cot in the darkness seemingly quiescent
but agonized fire burned in his brain sick-
ening lurches of memory carried him down
to the past hawk hadnt been much the
gentleman with madge mistakenly hed
believed her to have his own wild nature
but beneath the bubble and froth of her
personality was a quiet surface the third
time his escapades made her break off with
him he had laughed it off skipped half a
semester gone on a hell-bending trip
when he got back single had crossed him
and the wedding date was set hawk
didnt stay around for the wedding but
as soon as he was graduated got out of
there hed been running away ever since
and all hed ever accomplished by those
years of trying to forget was to make him-
self realize that he achingly loved madge

  hawk tossed on the cot damn the day
john-boy set foot on this ship he roused
when corpin called for take-off orders
hawk went woodenly through his paces
then

  youre sure singles aboard he asked
abruptly

  i saw him corpins voice came hes
all shot to pieces hawk

   all right forget it

  sounded like his faith in human na-
ture was shot corpin persisted an un-
mistakably sly note in his voice

   i told you to forget it didnt i  hawk
snapped

  corpin was grieved god help us all
he said piously single said if my con-
science hurt me so much-which it does
badly-i should take the greenies back to
their village he even offered to help me
stage a mutiny against you if id promise
to do that

  but naturally said hawk you
wouldnt even think of turning against
me shut up corpin your hypocrisy
makes me sick hawk jammed over the
-	planet

cut-off the black scowl lingering on his
face he should stop putting up with cor-
pin the pious why did he at all deep in
him he sensed the gross answer the ma-
sochism of the sinful-and corpin was a
whip   

that conversation planted a
seed two and a half days after the
s s selwyn blasted off on the five day
run to the eros slave-market hawk called
johnny single to his cabin single entered
took one startled look at the dozen quiet-
faced men who leaned against the walls
sat on the cot or other articles of furniture
there was a grim smiling spark in hawks
eyes

  john-boy he said yesterday you of-
fered corpin to help mutiny if hed take
the greenies back to andrigo

  singles eyes were big on the weapon
each man carried finally corpins
crazy he said he doesnt know sarcasm
when he hears it

  i figured you might be ribbing him
said hawk heres my proposition im
quitting this life slavings a bit too rough
a racket for me and im getting out ive
dedded to take the greenies back to an-
drigo these men are all members of my
original crew and theyre with me gen-
erally they get a commission on the sale
of each greenie ill make it good to them
whose side you on

  yours said single

  heres a gun said hawk he passed
a five-pound jim-cracker to single hawk
closely observed the way single slowly
passed two fingers into the trigger-guard

  what gave you the idea single said
at last meeting hawks eyes steadily
hawk bitterly resented the knowing look

  if you think its madge youre crazy
he said shortly i had the stink of slave-
running in my nose a long time before you
entered the act now men he said facing
the others as far as corpin knows youre
all off watch in your bunks i arranged it
that way months ago you remember in
case it ever came to a showdown the
showdowns here no killing if possible
but dont get fooled

  after having one of the men inspect the
corridor outside hawk led the men in a

stories

body down toward the engine-room heart
of the ship from which every important
function was controlled they moved
quietly almost unbreathing outside the
engine-room hatch hawk delegated three
men to space themselves through the cor-
ridor to nab any men who might not be
stationed below then hawk boldly opened
the hatchway entered stood on the balcony
overlooking the machine-filled engine-room
here and there a man stood at his post
others were undoubtedly out of hawks
line of sight corpin was not to be seen

  hawk opened the door again gestured
to the men single fell into step behind
hawk as they easily descended the ladder
to the engine-room deck

  take over your regular posts hawk
spoke to those following him tell the
men its my orders that they be relieved
if they object shove your jim-crackers in-
to their ribs might be a good thing if you
do that anyway

  his eyes sharpened as three of the men
drifted off toward the three men visible be-
fore the protonoclast gauges he would
have given a lot to know just where cor-
pin was chances were-

  the sudden sharp crash of a jim-crack-
er set steel plates to ringing hawk whirl-
ed in time to see singles face pouring
sweat his blond hair awry on his fore-
head and in his hand his jim-cracker
still spitting static

  single was wildly desperately excited
its a trap he yelled at hawk corpin
-i saw him up there at the port i
tried to blast him 

there was a row of portholes
looking down on the engine room
from the corridor where hawk had his
other men stationed hawks stomach
seemed to drop out of his body in a sick-
ening swoop a trap was impossible corpin
wouldnt have known-unless he hud put
the idea into hawks head

  the metallic echoes of singles fire had
hardly ceased their reverberations when
the engine-room was suddenly alive with
men from behind the machines from
every possible hiding place corpins men
poured weapons drawn hawk blew out
his breath savagely let go with his jim-
slave-ship to andrigo	

cracker glanced wildly toward the ladder
instead of his men corpin and two others
of the mutinous crew members appeared

  youre outnumbered corpin roared
down at hawk give up ill let you go
with your life hawk

  for answer hawks arm flew up as if
by subconscious impulse the wild thought
of murder was in his head but he was
bowled backward as two men overflowed
him the charge went wild and hawk was
flat on his back from the direction his
charge had traveled hawk saw a blue-
white flare as the explosion came he
thought incredulously i hit the air-re
finer   

  his weapon was tom out of his hands
the chill recognition of utter disaster over-
came him but with it came recklessness
as well in him was the unholy desire
for immolation a manifestation of the same
emotion which made him take singles
manhandling he needed punishment even
the extreme punishment of dying with a
jim-cracker in his gizzard with a roar
he stretched himself erect and tore into
his attackers with an ugly bloody delight

  three men fell before his blows then
hawk stumbled-over singles prone body

  in the act of falling one of the wipers
a runt stepped in at an angle and with
the full power of both clasped fists caught
hawk across the back of the neck hawk
fell to his knees rose to his full height
as if his reflexes might overcome the stun-
ning force of that blow and then fell
conclusively flat on his face

hawk was lying on his side
when he awoke he groaned miser-
ably rolled to his back when the base of
his skull touched the cold supra-steel floor
of the cell he jerked it out of contact
wincing with the thudding pain for a-
while he was sick in every fiber of his
beaten body that passed then he smelled
cigarette smoke and a cigarette was shoved
between his lips

  smoke that said single his voice
moody

  hawk lay perfectly motionless keeping
his eyes closed while he quietly smoked
through his eyelids poured light that of
the -watt duro-globe set into the over-

heads above the cell without looking
hawk knew every item of furnishing-
two chairs table wall food-slot crude
washstand johnnie-they were imprison-
ed in short in the well-known brig a cage
of walls and bars composed of supra-steel
escape from here was an impossible
thought

  the brig was placed in the bottommost
hold a triangular compartment wedged in
between the fission motors on one side
and no  rotor on the other with inch-
thick supra-steel walls between above the
muted pounding thrust of the rotor hawk
could hear the leaf-like rustle of the green-
ies talk they were also quartered here
in soil-bins stretching along the opposite
side of the hold hawk had heard that
greenies talked but had never been con-
fronted with the fact

  he opened his eyes rolled them until
he saw single who was sitting cross-leg-
ged at the composition table

  listen to them talk john-boy hawk
said softly makes you realize they might
not be so far from being human

  yeah it does doesnt it singles eyes
were pale lifeless and wouldnt meet
hawks

  hawk said his words remorseless as a
lashing whip across his own back oh i
know what you think of me john-boy
remember you asked me what gave me
the idea of taking the greenies back to
andrigo john-boy it was corpin who
planted the seed in my head and watched
it sprout he was ready and waiting for
me any time i made the break and i was
fool enoiigh not to realize it he smoked
looking straight up toward the overheads
he mused how much of a fool can one
man be in a lifetime john-boy

  ill tell you said single his mood
was the same bitter and without life he
can be fool enough to marry a girl who
doesnt love him thats me he jerked
his thumb indicatively against his chest
you were the right man for her-you
still could be now neither of us will see
earth again much less madge

  unless we fight our way free said
hawk sitting up he decided he didnt
like the trend of the conversation bleakly
he knew in his heart that the old romance
	planet

was dead even the flowers of memory
should riot be laid at the sunken grave

   whats our first step to freedom for
instance single said without interest
 hawk said cryptically to want free-
dom i want it and all i want it for is to
get those greenies back to andrigo after
that i dont much care

 single looked blank then he painfully
rose his clothes were half-torn off his
body his skin was lacerated and bruised in
numerous places indicating the terrific
battle hed put up he gave hawk a hand
pulled him to his feet single smiled weari-
ly

  you beat everything hawk you took
advantage of my angelic nature at decimal
point but in return you took me out on
some fine binges with the idea of showing
me about life its the same thing all over
again except-

  hawk grinned but said soberly ex-
cept that this time we might both learn
about death

  suddenly the greenies set up an excited
leaf-twittering rushed to the bars of their
cells the rusted hatch door to the com-
partment was pushed aggressively open
the weirdly green peaked faces of the
greenies were illuminated in the shaft of
light from the outer compartment- hawk
and single leaped to the bars their eyes
on the advancing figure it was corpin
he strode with lordly magnificence to the
cell pendulous jowls quivering with fury

  ive been sinful in my day hawk he
snarled but my sins dont compare with
your ungodly acts i personally noted that
you deliberately sent a bullet into the air-
refinery this means we have no air ex-
cept that in the ship and weve still got
three days in space possibly several crew
members will die-including your so-called
loyal men who have sworn in with me
now that your little coup is a failure im
hereto warn you that we must therefore
cut this compartment off from the air-
circulating network

  hawk studied him what about the
greenies 

  corpin was really in a panic whos
worried about the greenies at a time like
this he blubbered this is serious
hawk he started for the hatch door

stories

arms swinging like lumpy pendulums

  hawk called sternly after him am i
to understand you intend for us to asphyx-
iate mr corpin

  i hope your air holds out corpin
said thats all i can say for you and your
friend god rest you

  thi heavy rusted door swung shut be-
hind him bounced open subsided again to
the shut position

single was looking at the door
longingly did you actually send a
bullet into the air-refinery on purpose
hawk he asked

  hawk grunted naturally not thats
corpins excuse to practice effortless mur-
der his deep eyes were roving the cell
lingered on the furniture he started to-
ward it help me break up this table
john-boy he said his voice was uncer-
tain might be able to use a couple crow-
bars

  by prodigious effort and the use of their
belt-buckles as screwdrivers they took the
table apart it required an hour or longer
hawk used the table legs in an attempt to
bend some of the bars the bars had an
almost non-existent coefficient of elasticity
however and besides this there was not
enough leverage grimly and sweating
hawk hurled the table-legs into a corner

  fine way to bum oxsh-oxshgen his
tongue got mixed in his mouth

  lets burn shome more singles voice
was extraordinarily shrill his eyes lumin-
ous he cracked a match into flame
hawks eyes narrowed on the brilliant blue
flare then he thoughtfully took a cigarette
suddenly his mind seemed to skip a whole
sequence of thoughts when he was aware
again the cigarette was burned a quarter
through and he was pacing with terrific
energy up and down the length of the
brig his mind soared he was drunk

  thash it he shouted stopping in his
tracks unsteadily he got in front of
single who was senselessly pacing also
and leaving the cigarette dangling from
his lips clamped his giants hands on
singles shoulders

  hawks vision was blurred but he fo-
cused long enough to see that the pupils
of singles eyes were big and out of con- 
trol shstand still hawk shouted thickly
schumpings wrong-but its blasted
good were blind drunk oxshgen-drunk
its the greenies that utter ignoramus
corpin

  single grinned laxly have nother shi-
garette hawk of the spashways burn up
more oxygen too much oxygen hawk of
the spashways remember how they put
us through oxygen tesh in a spashship at
deshmal point drunk then too problem
was to releash enough shee-o-two into
the air to bring air back to normal howd
you come out on that tesh hawk of
spashways 

  how had he come out hawks brain
was on fire partly from the effort of
thought he brushed drunkenly past sin-
gle hung on the bars looking across at
the greenies

  hawk could hear their twittering in
it was an eery down-beat note that could
be likened to a dirge forcing his eyes to
focus by sheer will hawk saw the green-
ies slumped in weirdly contorted positions
against the bars of the soil-bins

  they were smothering

  their air supply was bad

in hawk burgeoned the desire to laugh
-a bubbling chuckling emotion that
grew unreasonably out of his horror but
even horror seemed funny gasping he
fell to hands and knees crawled across
the floor to single who was sprawled
against the wall smiling foolishly

  lishen john-boy said hawk confi-
dentially think during tesh at desh-
mal point i sholved problem wasnt orth-
dox professhors wanted to exshpel me

  shingle he said patiently when sin-
gle didnt answer lishen were dying
burning up not made to breathe pure
oxshgen we have to get some shee-o-
two into the air howd i do it
singles lips quirked with laughter
burned the furniture thash what hawk
of spashways did laboriously single
heaved to his feet ill help you wheresh
oxshgen coming from thought corpin
wanted to shmother ush

  shu he did explained hawk as if he
had all of eternity in which to elucidate

-planet stories-july



but his scheme backfired the greeniesh
naturally breathed in all the shee-o-two
and breathed out oxshgen that makesh
it bad for ush worsh for them theyre
shuffocating were burning up    thing
is bring air back to normal like i did at
deshimal point when nasty professhors
wanted to kick me out

  fine said single heartily heresh my
shirt

  hawk accepted it with grave thanks he
stacked the table-top against the bars of
the cell used singles shirt as kindling
applied flame hawks brain was a bright
pin wheel by this time he had practically
lost identity with duration would forget
his purpose in doing one thing no sooner
than he started on another but deep in his
subconscious was an intense striving for
an ultimate effect a brass ring that his
whirling conscious mind could only pluck
at each time round

  this subconscious urging received a
measure of gratification when flame blos-
somed through the shirt bit eagerly into
the table-top it was a white-hot flame
burned with a sizzling fury

  good work hawk of spashways
smiled johnny single pretty fire hawk
of spashways bet corpin could kick him-
shelf

  behind the red film drawn across his
eyes the alert part of hawks brain sat
like a crouched animal in the back of
his head the fire shot up with pristine
purity a lactescent flame without the be-
traying yellowness of escaping gases with
the concentrated fury of an oxygen-torch
it beat against the supra-steel bars against
which the table-top leaned when these
bars glowed first red and then began to
assume the whitish color of the flames
laving them hawk aroused single by
slapping his face palm and backhand
single took it in the spirit in which it was
intended rose hawk shoved one table
leg at him took the other

  gotta work fast john-boy he mut-
tered no more fuel faster the fuel
burns lesh oxshen shlower fuel burns
lesh heat catch

  sure said single makesh lotsh of
shee-o-two for greenies though

two of the bars which stretched from

slave-ship to andrigo

                                 ft
	planet

deck to overheads were now at white heat
for two feet of their length were soft
enough to yield to the battering blows the
two men now directed against them then
sparks arose in a spitting shower as the
table-top crashed in ruins the two men
leaped back a wounded expression ap-
peared on singles face as he slapped at
the burns on face and bare chest hawk
kept on ramming at his bar endeavoring
to widen the space of escape but the bar
was scaling down to red now that there
was no flame on it single solved the prob-
lem by holding the already charred end
of his improvised battering ram in the
coals on the floor it caught flame instant-
ly single held it against the bar hawk was
working on so furiously and potently
did the virtually pure oxygen of the at-
mosphere unite with its fuel that the bar
again whitened softened at each plunk-
ing blow it gave another inch

  over the labored panting of hawk the
spit of flame the pound of the battering
ram came a growing murmur from the
greenies hawk was elated it was ob-
vious that enough carbon dioxide had been
added to the air to revive the suffocating
plant-people conversely hawk felt less
of that heady disagreeable drunkenness he
had experienced before the oxygen per-
centage went down he gave the bar a
final blow and then with a huge grin of
triumph tossed his battering ram crashing
into a corner

  thats it he shouted at single let
up youre feeling better

  god yes single dropped the consum-
ed table-leg in time to avoid burning his
fingers he weaved weakly to a chair fell
into it im all burned out

  hawk took the other chair set fire to
it theres still too much oxygen in the
air for us or the greenies lets sit on the
floor for awhile throw that chair on too
then well get the hell out of here

when the fire burned with yel-
low fairly lazy tongues of flame
the two men slipped through the cooled
aperture in the cell bars in the cells op-
posite the greenies were clustered solid
at the bars hawk grinned at them a
bit dizzily-the last vestiges of the oxy-

stormes	

gen-jag disappearing

  chummy rascals said hawk it al-
most embarrassed him to feel a dormant
conscience leaping to life

  single nodded they sense youre on
their side quinn probably you couldnt
have a better character-endorsement
hawk flung him a look so what should
i do carry one around in my pocket as a
testimonial 

  madge wont need much persuading
said single

  who said anything about madge you
talk too much lets get out of here 

  as soon as they set foot in the outer
compartment and hawk smelled the pecu-
liar deadness of the air-caused partly by
lack of air-circulation partly by out-size
amounts of see-o-two-hawks plan
leaped full-born into his head

  i think were going to lick corpin the
bloated psalm-singer he told single the
next compartment is right by the engine-
room its a storage compartment and
theres at least a ton of waste in the bins
waiting for us to set fire to it then watch
those rats scuttle into the trap first we
need some air-helmets if they havent
already commandeered them- in which
case well have to get along without em
first i need a shirt said single ges-
turing at his nakedness

  hawk tossed single his jacket then led
the way with luck they shouldnt run in-
to much opposition at first most of the
men would be concentrated in the engine-
room or else off-watch in their bunks he
led single to the upper deck hawk was
just working the combination-lock on the
lazarette when he heard a footstep he and
single froze tensely against the lazarette
door the man who came into sight was
big nibley who had been one of hawks
original crew-members in the day when
hawks only business venture was the
fairly honest one of running weapons to
the beleaguered colonists on triton hawk
hoped against hope that nibley would go
on past but the big man saw them instant-
ly his mouth fell open while he stared
hawk stepped out into the open

  fall in with us nibley he said softly
with luck well be able to take over from
corpin
slave-ship

  painful uncertainty passed over nibleys
face then he blurted i cant hawk you
havent got a chance corpin would mur-
der me

he spun on his heel ran panting to-
ward the nearest ladder bitterly dis-
appointed hawk went off after him caught
him by the belt yanked chopped savagely
at his temple nibley squirmed on the
deck hawk hit him again convulsively
then came back to the lazarette panting

  thats the kind of loyalty i can ex-
pect he growled he jerked open the
lazarette door the room was well stock-
ed the men buckled each others air-
helmets then hawk stuck broken match-
es into the oxygen valves of the remaining
few helmets the oxygen hissed out and
would continue to do so until the tiny tanks
were empty they took a jim-cracker a-
piece from the wall then descended to the
next deck again entered the storage com-
partment adjacent to the engine-room
here hawk tossed a lighted match into
a bin of waste a sluggish flame came into
being but since the oxygen content of
the air was already low clouds of humid
smoke snuffed it out

  for a moment that worried hawk then
he saw smoke still rolling out and assum-
ed that the kindling point was being main-
tained that the waste would rapidly smould-
er which made it even better for his pur-
pose

  lets get an armful of this waste john-
boy hawk gestured to a nearby bin ig-
nored singles puzzled look by the time
the compartment was heavy with smoke
they were loaded up and staggering to-
ward the engine-room door hawk freed
two fingers to pull at the handle then kick-
ed the door open the rest of the way the
difference in temperature between the en-
gine-room and the smoke-filled compart-
ment instantly created a suction effect-
the hotter air in the engine room grabbed
at the cooler smoke brought it rolling in
in great turgid masses

  under cover of the smoke barrier hawk
lighted the new fuel threw it twenty feet
down into the engine room above the
spit of the protonoclasts and the rolling
pound of the rotors hawk heard men

to andrigo	

shouting he gripped the railing through
a rift in the voluminous clouds he saw men
running beating at the smoldering masses
of waste hawks eyes snapped narrowed
as he saw corpin actually running toward
the center of the disturbance his eyes
puffy and already reddened from smoke
corpin was carrying a fire-extinguisher
he was about to up-end it when hawk
pulled his jim-cracker and aiming with
extreme care shot it out of his hands cor-
pin stood stricken slowly raising his eyes
as if they would inevitably be drawn to the
avenging figure at the railing inspired
hate distorted his face he pulled his own
weapon but whirlpools of smoke seemed
to suck him under the shot never came

  more waste hawk snapped at single
but single had already gone and was back
with another armload hawk threw it over-
board then grabbed at single and felt his
way down the broad ladder as they reach-
ed the deck choking shadows darted past
them grabbed at the ladder and dragged
themselves up hawk blundered past seve-
ral machines anxious to get to the air-
pumps fearful that corpin would get there
first however at that moment hawk heard
corpins voice nearby screaming wordless-
ly in a high vindictive tone-he saw the
fat shadowy form fighting through the
smoke reached out and grabbed

  corpin choked rackingly primeval loath-
ing showed in his almost blinded eyes
when he saw hawk

  i might have known he snarled the
great brain from decimal point cant think
of any better way to take over the ship
than to burn up our few remaining liters
of oxygen that space-helmet will last
you approximately another hour then
youll be as dead as the rest of us

  he lunged kicking mightily at hawks
groin hawk leaped back grabbed corpin
by the ankle brought him down with a
sodden thump he whipped a boot-tip at
the fat throat but corpin rolled was
swallowed by smoke hawk heard his
cough ascending the ladder single wor-
riedly started after but hawk gently stop-
ped him

  he cant go where the smoke cant
follow him he told single ill show you
this way he stopped at the waste-dis-
	planet

posal slot here a pile of oily waste had
collected hawk scooped up a great arm-
ful singly followed suit hawk dumped
it at the base of the air-circulating pumps
which were at present not in operation
and threw over the switch the pump-
motors whirred into action smoke was
sucked through the grating single caught
on instantly chuckled

hawk carefully studied

the ventilator-duct board here by
remote control he could cut oil or close
any compartment in the ship to the action
of the air-pumps which meant he could
fill the ship with smoke he started throw-
ing most of the ducts open

 it was single who thought of the
greenies lord by this time theyre suf-
focating on too much oxygen again quinn
maybe a little smoke-

  hawk whitened if the greenies died
so would everybody else he opened the
greenies duct wide then hurriedly set
fire to the new pile of waste the dirty
smoke poured into the ventilators like a
river after a minute however hawk
closed the greenies duct that too was
part of the plan but now a devil of un-
certainty was plaguing him if the green-
ies were dead-

  he waited a short while longer in in-
creasing nervousness then he stepped to
the auditory system of speaking-tubes
switched the connections over to general
he tuned the amplification up so that his
voice would have a booming all-powerful
impact

  men he stated raspingly corpin has
made fools of you if you think hes fitted
for command even of a junk-heap like this
one youre bigger fatheads than i thought
even with the help of god he wasnt
able to make a go of it when he dis-
covered the air-refinery was blinko he
went addle-pated didnt have the brains
to remember that greenies being plants
produce oxygen and would have made a
good air-refinery themselves they still
will so now get busy tell corpin to
go to hell get his keys to the greenies
cell circulate the greenies through the
ship then when youre ready to acknowl-

stormes

edge your mistake call me back by audio
and ill let up on this smoke but remem-
ber that im master aboard this mans

ship

  the speaking-tube zipped back into place
hawk pulled his jim-cracker exploring
it with his fingers to make sure it was
in working order single felt toward him
started to speak but hawk said savagely
dont worry john-boy i know approxi-
mately what im doing keep that smoke
pouring in there while im gone and shoot
anybody that might try to stop you

  single hesitated then he said patiently
i was going to say i dont think the
crew will throw over corpin just on the
basis of what you told them youve just
given corpin some brand-new information
to do you in with better not trust him

  im not

 nor any of the crew either hawk
thought glumly as he went on the double
to the next deck nibley had taught him
his lesson blast the man whod let his
whole life go to pot mix in with a bunch
of swill just because a woman threw him
over

outside the hold where the
greenies were captive hawk rested
comfortably against a bulkhead a grim
smile touching his lips he wasnt any too
soon dim coughing shapes came footing
it through the thick smoke the glow-
lamps set into the overheads showed the
men only as shadows but hawk was
able to count those shadows twenty-six
all told and that included nibley-and
corpin never was flight more precipitous
the hatch door slammed shut triumphantly
as the men entered the only place aboard
ship where there was a reasonable guar-
antee of oxygen

  the trap had worked to perfection

  if the greenies were still alive    the
doubt had hawk gritting his teeth finally
he could stand it no longer went in long
strides toward the door-and at that mo-
ment the door slammed open and cor-
pin stood on the threshold breathing big
with excitement and triumph plainly visi-
ble against the light inside the greenies
compartment
slave-ship

  at the first renewed breath of smoke
he fell to choking swore aggrievedly he
closed the door halfway after he had
stopped choking his triumphant voice
came

  the fool the soft stupid fool stick
to me men believe me ill take you to
heights hawk never dreamed of once we
have enough money well be able to move
in the ways of god but not before
he paused one finger pressed thought-
fully into his pudgy cheek

  heres the strategy men we have to
take the engine-room from hawk and that
single fellow well herd the greenies in
front of us theyll more or less clear the
smoke and leave us a path of oxygen to
travel through between you and i hawk
wont have the guts to shoot a greenie
he chuckled well play hawks game
better than he can

  hawk glided silently forward a few
feet he struck his jim-cracker a few
inches from corpins face his voice came
jarringly

corpin the games already played out
corpins head pivoted on its fat neck
small eyes wild with shock-as he took in
the terrifying reality of hawks presence
his face turned ashy

  as god is my witness he blurted
you have always been my friend hawk
that said hawk i am sure of
start passing out the greenies

  for answer corpins pendulous lips
firmed with desperate resolve he moved a
mere inch the hatch door which was
being held open only by his bulk swung
hard against hawks gun hand hawks
brain seemed to rock in its cranial fluid
as agony shot up his arm there was a
moment of incredulity when he saw his
five-pound jim-cracker drop from his
numbed fingers felt himself spinning
around to keep balance

  out of the comer of his eye he saw
corpin scrabbling in a panic of haste at
his jim-cracker in order to get a shot in at
hawk corpin had to have a line of fire
he heaved his mountainous shoulder
against the door

  the process of thought hardly describ-
ed what occurred in hawks head he
jcould attempt to regain his balance to

to andrigo	

snatch up the jim-cracker by which time
he would be dead he chose instead not
by thought but by instinct and animal re-
action to add speed to his inadvertent
spin he completed the turn in time to
meet the weight of the opening door

   corpins shot almost blasted in his ear-
drums hawk heaved the mass of his body
against the door momentarily felt the re-
sistance of corpins body then heard cor-
pins anguished shout as he was forced to
give way hawk smashed the door shut
then used the reaction to that motion to
send him in the opposite direction toward
his jim-cracker

  he scooped it up

  by that time the door had bounced open
again as was its habit corpin was ready
but so was hawk corpins fingers con-
tracted on the trigger-but the shot never
came hawks charge caught him low in
the stomach opened him from hip to hip
corpin gulped belched blood leaned for-
ward when he fell he rolled almost to
the feet of his staring men

  hold it hawk yelled when two of
the men made as if to draw he leaped to
the threshold of the compartment his lips
drawn up in an acid mirthless grin

  you men turned against me he said
thats all right im dumping you off at
the first civilized port we hit im getting
you and all the rotten things weve stood
for out of my hair now get the greenies
out of those cells get yourselves in later
ill pick out six or eight of you to help
get this ship back to andrigo but youll
work in chains

moodily hawk watched the last
of the greenies scurry down the
gangway and vanish among the dusty
dunes of andrigo there went his old life
now he could begin with the new but the
resolve didnt impress him he cared no
more for a life of respectability than he
did for one as a slaver he told single as
much

  single shrugged there are other ways
to respectability than sitting in a white cot-
tage with roses around the front door the
rest of your life quinn for instance-
well one slaver runner less doesnt wipe
out the trade in greenies and one more
	planet

average respectable man added to society
doesnt help them keep supplied with the
auxin they need in order to live if a man
really wanted to move in the ways of god
-somebody with guts quinn-he could
do something about it catch

 hawks studied him through slitted eyes
no he said abruptly then turned away
from singles penetrating blue eyes giv-
ing himself the excuse that he had to get
the ship to the asteroidal repair station a
half million miles farther on but single
stopped him grinning

 for instance quinn you could organize
the sfpom-society for the protection

stormes

of minorities

  hawks dark face turned a perfect crim-
son really getting back at me arent
you he demanded maybe ill call that
bluff john-boy the blasted government
doesnt give a care about the greenies but
the right man could tell the government to
go to and knock the slavers out of the
sky

  and what about madge

  hawks shoulders hunched as if at a
blow he fought a short-lived battle
whether he won it or lost was problem-
atical when the time comes ill go
back to her he said if shell have me

sign of life

by dave dryfoos

eorge main lay dying in
the wreckage of the space-ship
dying-and cursing the deadly
wind of venus it had killed his mates it
would soon have him

  the wind was trying to finish him off
right now it shrieked moaned whispered
and shouted through the smashed hull
where he sprawled in his space-suit
laughed too the wind was a murderer
-and was glad

  all but he were dead soon the grit-
laden wind would bury them and their
ship then all the effort the skill the

faith-all the ingenuity and labor expend-
ed on the expedition-would be wiped
away as invisible as the wind that buried
them

  thinking of that thinking back over each
agonizing hour since his landing on venus
george main wondered what he should
have done what he could now do to pre-
vent the utter waste of their efforts and
their lives

  the wind was his enemy-and the wind
couldnt even be seen only the dust it
carried was visible too visible dust was
so thick in the upper atmosphere that the



  the d eat h-wirids of venus screamed with glee as
  george main lay dying then the winds brought
  strange shapes to haunt him-and a stranger hope-

idly george led the dance with a waggled forefinger
	planet

scope-readers had mistaken dust-clouds for
solid ground

  with ports blinded by dust the possi-
bility of that error had been obvious
enough the navigator knew the risk he
chanced it-and lost the toss

  george knew he was still alive only be-
cause hed acted like a childish eager-bea-
ver and had been tolerated by the others
because he was the crews youngest mem-
ber

  ever since he could read and dream hed
wanted to be the first man ever to touch
the soil of venus so having no duties
connected with setting down the ship
hed gotten into his space-suit and had
waited by a hatch he was standing there
when the ship went into the twenty-mile
free fall that smashed it

  george didnt know who opened the es-
cape hatch and shoved him out that
man was dead along with the rest of the
crew unlike gedrges suit the space-ship
had no parachute

hed landed blind in dust so
thick he didnt know he was down
till he got there for forty-eight hours
hed lain where he fell waiting for a lull
in the storm so he could see the ship

  when the wind finally quit the ship was
already half buried thirsty hungry stink-
ing in the hot suit george had staggered
over windrow after windrow of dust to
reach it

  hed broken out an emergency-jug of
water found some uncontaminated food
erected within the hull a small gas-proof
tent and then passed out before he could
crawl in the tent to eat and drink

  later hed gone out while the lull con-
tinued to search for bodies like the hull
itself they were scattered over a wide
area some were already buried in dust
the wind had buried them

  the wind-the murdering wind the
wind of formaldehyde that poisoned every
drop of water it touched every bit of
food the wind that limited georges sup-
plies to unbroken containers- of which
there were tragically few

  the wind mocked him then and there-
after it mocked his efforts to find the

stories

ships log and continue it it mocked his
efforts to live

  he tried to fight back he lay prone
and relaxed because that took less oxygen
he lay in the suit and not in the tent
because that took less oxygen he ate and
drank but once a day because that took
less oxygen

  so he had run out of water while there
were still some potassium oxides left to
refresh his thrice-breathed air some oxy-
gen for the tent

  george main wanted to live knew he
would die and was enraged at the thought
that he would die without having accom-
plished anything he and his friends and
the pioneering scientists back of them
had put too much effort into trans-sys-
tem travel to have it all come to nothing
like this

  stubbornly he noted in the log that he
was now dehydrated to the point of oc-
casional delirium and that he hated the
wind

  as if that wind had not already done
enough it now sought to destroy his last
remaining moments of sanity it brought
a- horde of odd shapes to haunt him

  the shapes literally rolled into the dust-
filled metal cavity where he lay writing-
the wind rolled them but when they got
into shelter--had rolled to one side or the
other of the holes through which theyd
come-the shapes began to move slowly
under their own power

  they all looked alike there were a
couple of dozen maybe- george counted
ten and gave up because counting was too
much like work they were teardrops-
eight-inch yellow teardrops with the point
down and each point rested on an ex-
tensible foot that looked like a blue star-
fish about four inches across its seven
points

  they came in rolling along the ground
as the wind took them and then extended
their stars from some hidden place and
moved on them when out of the wind

  that is they seemed to but whether
they were in the hull or in his mind
george was by no means sure

  nothing could live in this wind noth-
ing could live on a planet with no water
where the air was full of formaldehyde
sign of life	

ready to react with proteins the basis of
life

  he lay motionless watching idiy there
was no sound but the wind the yellow
teardrops scattered out they could have
been exploring-or seeking shelter-or
nonexistent

  when he got tired of watching them
george put the log aside and slept

he awoke to find a small congrega-
tion of teardrops surrounding the
watch strapped outside the suit on his left
wrist the watch was going-wound
through habit every twenty-four hours
though that was but a third of a day here
on venus the teardrops were curious
about it

  how he got the idea they were curious
george didnt quite know they seemed
attracted to it was all there were no
eyes so far as he could tell-no ears if
these things had senses they were not
like terrestrial senses but the teardrops
did have an attitude of attention

  george removed his watch laid it before
them two teardrops detached themselves
from the group to examine his right hand
with which hed slipped off the wrist-band
three others perched  the dust-covered
deck the watch between them and him

  george flexed his right hand twiddled
his fingers the teardrops seemed unafraid
he chose one and lifted it it seemed
light in weight its star-foot was slightly
prehensile and grasped his glove with tiny
claws arranged in rows on its bottom sur-
face

  the claws seemed for clinging not for
seizing george put down the teardrop
turned it over and found no opening any-
where on the surface if these things lived
he decided they must be plants synthe-
sizing their food-they had no way to
eat as animals do

  vaguely george made up his wavering
mind that the things existed outside his
imagination they were alive they felt
curiosity about him leathery he found
them-hard and smooth except for the
foot

  when he set down the teardrop hed
been examining the three by his watch
took up a rhythmic motion the center

one stood in place swaying slowly above
the watch like a bit of seaweed in a quiet
lagoon

  each of the other two had somehow ob-
tained a pebble they set their pebbles
down near the watch each then tapped
with a star-point first at the pebble then
at the watch back and forth they swayed
their motions synchronized-perhaps di-
rected by the center one

  interesting-but meaningless it was
equally meaningless when the two tear-
drops at his right began to dance they
found an empty food-can lid pushed it
near his hand and began a concerted sway-
ing and pointing that took them between
hand and can

  idly george led the dance with a wag-
gled forefinger the teardrops promptly
changed their motion they stood in place
no longer pointing alternately at lid and
finger but swaying between them in time
with george

 they were slow though-he could
easily have left them behind but if he
moved his finger slowly enough they kept
perfect time

  the dance at the watch had stopped
many teardrops gathered around the pair
that followed the beat of his right index
finger

  it must have amused them but it soon
tired george he stopped

  he needed all his remaining energy to
think with he knew these teardrops were
sentient they were curious they com-
municated with each other and they
danced they had minds therefore

george remembered hearing that
man had danced even before he
learned to speak in a primitive effort to
express his feelings he knew some birds
dance too-as a courtship procedure in-
sects even

  but why did the teardrops dance

  what was the significance of rhythmic
motion between a pebble and a watch a
tin lid and a mans hand what did the
pebbles mean

  the pebble was a native object known
to be lifeless inanimate the watch was
a strange something that moved the
can-lid did not move the hand-gloved
	planet

though they could not know that-was an
object that moved

  the dance was a question therefore
alive or dead the teardrops wanted to
know is the watch that moves by itself
alive the strangely symmetrical lid of
a can is it alive  the oddshaped hand 

  these teardrops had good minds-
could grasp abstractions in a sense
george felt the difference between ani-
mate and inanimate objects is an abstrac-
tion in his dying stale the notion amused
him

  smiling he placed a pebble on the
watch another on the lid he sat up
moved his weakened body so they could
perhaps tell it was a unit he picked up a
teardrop in each hand held them at his
visor rolled his eyes and opened and
shut his mouth he spoke to them he
sang to them he swayed with them to
show he too could dance

  they made no sign of reply none that
he could recognize at any rate

  carefully he felt and looked at the en-
tire surface of a teardrop putting one
down to devote both hands to the other
he thought perhaps the lack of organs and
openings might simply mean they were
clothed or armored in some way but
the thing was apparently naked the sur-
faces he touched were probably skin he
didnt know

  and they would they know what a
man was were they even certain he was
alive

  one of them was behind him dancing
before the tent seeing that he was cer-
tain the teardrops hadnt yet distinguished
the animate from the inanimate in the
objects around them here

  and george had little time to teach
them already he was dull and listless
his vision was playing tricks on him

stories

  like as not hed be dead before they
knew for certain hed been alive dead in
the grotesque space-suit preserved in an
atmosphere of formaldehyde his body
would seem like a machine that had run
down there would be no discernable
difference between himself and his watch

  but if they knew hed been alive they
might remember then they were intelli-
gent could communicate with one another
by rights they should have some kind
of legends or traditions or history if they
did if they knew theyd seen alien life
theyd keep the memory alive

  theyd recognize the next man to land
on venus might find means to tell of this
first expedition might lead a man to the
buried space-ship the bodies the ships
log

  at least they could defeat the wind the
teardrops could keep his life and the lives
of his mates from going utterly to waste
whether men ever found out or not the
teardrops themselves would know that the
expedition had reached venus

  but first george had to prove he was
alive like them-not some strangely mo-
bile meteorite nor oddly contrived ma-
chine

  his very lack of strength his real near-
ness to death provided george with the
means he sought already he was half
anesthetized by weakness and shock he
didnt have to worry about pain

  holding his breath he took off his hel-
met he picked up a teardrop with each
hand held them to his hot cheeks then
he let himself breathe

  he knew the physical changes to follow
would be obvious to the intelligent little
dancers he held in his hands he hoped
they wouldnt get hurt when they fell

  hurt or not theyd soon figure out
hed been alive-once he was dead

monster

by william morrison

there was a faint

scratching at the door so faint that
alice kidd who had been listening
fearfully for precisely that sound was at
first not certain that she heard it but
as she came close to the doorway it was
no longer possible to doubt and a chill
went through her at the thought of the
creature panting eagerly on the other side
now she could hear it whine and despite

her knowledge that the gesture was an idle
one she could not help once more feeling
the bolt behind the door then she made
sure that the shutters too were securely
barred although these were usually in less
danger most of the animals could not ap-
ply pressure very far above the ground

 small was staring at her not particularly
frightened but very much interested her
face she thought must be pale through the


	planet

radiation tan ordinarily there was noth-
ing timid or fragile about her or she
would never have accompanied her hus-
band to mars but all the same she felt
weak and helpless before the danger that
threatened and she shuddered as her five-
year-old son asked can it get in mom-
my 

  i hope not darling come lets go into
the other room and bolt the connecting
door and then ill call up daddy

  does it want to eat us mommy
alice shuddered again dont talk about
it she said and carried him quickly into
the next room when the door was bolted
she pressed the contact button asked for
mr kidd and almost at once was speak-
ing to anthony

  he listened quietly his dark face in the
visor as grave as if he were concerned
with some problem of engineering and
then said in a tone of reassurance dont
worry it carft get in not under a couple
of hours anyway and even if it does
you have that gun

  that explosive thing 

  itll do if you keep your nerve but i
dont think youll have to put it to the
test im coming home now anyway and
ill take care of our friend have any idea
what it is

  i havent seen it it just whines a little
and keeps scratching very quietly
probably a badgerine hope it doesnt
try to tunnel under the floor all right
sugar keep your shirt on and the mars
marines will be there to the rescue
take care of yourself

  and how think i want you to be left
with all that insurance money and fall
victim to some fortune-hunter who sees
nothing in you but your beautiful bank
account 

he hung up and alice waited
trembling in the room where she
was she could no longer hear the straining
animal but she knew that it hadnt gone
away she tried to get interested in some
of smalls childish treasures the blocks
he had long outgrown and they kept the
things only because there was no one to
give them to and it seemed silly to throw

stories

anything away here besides alice had
the idea that her son might have a brother
or a sister some day soon if they ever de-
cided it was possible to raise a baby here
and toys were difficult to import as for
smalls magic hypno-ray ring his imita-
tion teleport bracelet and his genuine imi-
tation home teleset and similar objects
all obtained either by sending away one
quarter credit in stamps plus a cereal box-
top or by selling a special perfumed soap
to his neighbors-which in this case meant
his parents-she had always found it diffi-
cult to arouse any interest in them she
had in fact been slightly annoyed at
anthonys indulgence of his sons desire
to obtain them and it was impossible to
simulate interest now with that animal at
the door

  and then suddenly the animal wasnt
there any longer she didnt hear any noise
from anthonys gun it wasnt that kind
she felt simply the shock of contact as
the missile went through the creatures
body and shook the house then came a
long despairing chorus of yells and after
that for a moment silence she withdrew
the bolt of the connecting door and then
the buzzer sounded

  when anthony came in she fell into
his arms small however wasnt having
any emotional excitement he said what
was it daddy was it really a badgerine
not this time son just an octerocap
as if the other wasnt bad enough
said alice faintly the octerocap was an
eight-headed wolf and was as likely to kill
newcomers by the fright its appearance in-
duced as much as by its numerous teeth
anthony you must simply get me another
gun like yours

  you can take mine if you really feel
unsafe

  you know i wouldnt take it you
need yours to get home with and there
isnt so much danger as long as youre
within calling range but in case of emer-
gency-

  he nodded do you think i dont realize
that ive been cabling that idiot tapling
for another gun ever since we got here
not a chance

  but why does he think that the gov-
ernment sends engineers to mars for the
monster	

purpose of having them killed and eaten
by animals 

  taplings is not to reason why its but
to do according to regulations and let
others die he says that regulation l-
xc of code  forbids it

  the stupid fool

  call him by his right name that idiot
tapling or t i tapling as we usually
denote him at the office

  is he the same way to them

  and how operations have been drag-
ging along at half of capacity because he
says we havent filled out the necessary
forms for those spare parts we need
and we cant fill them out because the
forms have to be countersigned by the
vice-president in charge of operation m
and that gentleman is vacationing some-
where in space with a new bride and
cant be located so you see darling
youre cursing him in good company
even at that as anthony might have
pointed out he was suppressing a good
part of what might have been said of mr
tapling at the mines where anthony and
his fellow engineers worked everything
was completely automatic and the dozen
men were needed only for checking and
repairs it was t i tapling who had done
his best to ruin their lives

the houses he had ordered built
for them were not too bad to be rea-
sonably invulnerable to the drill-toothed
animals who abounded on these wastes
the walls would have had to be about a
dozen feet thick and tapling had had
no grounds for suspecting that fact which
had not been in any of the reports he had
read but it was unquestionably his fault
that the houses were so widely scattered
dealing with a planet where the sunlight
was weak and ultra-violet was obtained
chiefly from artificial radiation a planet
where the air was so cold that no one went
outdoors unless he had to t i tapling
had been worried about living space and
had generously allotted to each engineer
and his family territory uninhabited for
a couple of miles in every direction possi-
bly he expected them to grow vegetables
next to their houses apparently he had
no suspicion that he was making things

as easy as possible for the predatory ani-
mals

  and of all locations anthony and alice
had the worst their house was most iso-
lated was the most difficult to get to from
the office and was in the part of the coun-
try most liable to attack it was little won-
der that alice said as she had said so
often before but we must do something
do you think we could have an electric
barrier set up

  we could not thats against regulation
something or other too might kill friendly
animals

  but there isnt a single animal thats
friendly

  tell that to regulations and their guar-
dian mr tapling

  small looked up and said mommy we
ought to get a dog

  anthony nodded our brilliant son is
correct just as correct as he was when he
first suggested it two months ago

  but anthony you know how much
food costs here hed eat us out of-
dogs eat animals announced small
space dragoneer says so in his television
program

  smalls right agreed anthony ill
bet an octerocap has eight different kinds
of vitamins one for each head we ought
to try eating one ourselves and save
money

  ugh

  i want to eat an octerocap said small
he wants to eat me so i dont see why
i shouldnt eat him

  never heard more perfect logic in my
life observed anthony with pride
thats my boy however lets put the
lesson in logic aside for a moment and
repair the damage the thing caused get
the plastic metal alice

  but small was not to be so easily side-
tracked when the repairs to the door had
been completed he said as if continuing
a conversation that had been going on all
the time are we getting the dog soon
daddy

  i think we are small then for a
change i think your mommy will feel
safe in the house

  ill call him rover decided small
  rover let it be hell be unique-
	planet

the only dog- on mars with that name in
fact the only dog on mars

  im unique too daddy im the only
boy on mars called small

  its not your real name you know
it is so asserted small  anthony
jr is just a nickname when i start going
to television school im going to tell the
teacher that my name in small kidd
alice had been thinking she said
anthony dear instead of writing for a
dog why dont you try again to get one
of those new guns im sure that if you
did fill out a form-

  ive filled out thousands but dont
worry dear ill write t i tapling again
just dont expect too much though
alice tried to pretend that she didnt
but in her heart she felt a pang of disap-
pointment when tapling wrote back that
additional guns were forbidden not only
by regulation lxc of code  but by
virtue of certain other regulations as well
he was pleased however to reply favor-
ably to mr kidds other request and en-
closed forthwith a copy of a catalogue pub-
lished by the central terrestrial dog
breeding station

alices first thought was
that for once mr tapling had done
something right and without wrapping his
action up in red tape alices second
thought was that idiot tapling-for
the catalogue it turned out was three
hundred years old it had been published
some time before the first mars expedi-
tion had taken off and she could only
wonder from what antique waste-paper
pile the bureaucratic t i taplings
bureaucratic subordinates had dug it up

   it was nonetheless fascinating reading
and small was even more fascinated by
the pictures it contained moreover with
a catalogue actually in the house he seem-
ed to regard her as definitely committed
to get rover he wavered in his favorites
for that title between great danes and
saint bernards and alice as she contem-
plated the size of the two breeds could
only think of the enormous quantities of
food they would consume and shudder
in dismay

   she put up one final feeble struggle that

stowes

same night when anthony came home
and small showed him the wonders in the
new book look daddy this one looks
like a sheep

  its a bedlington terrier

  can we eat it

  no it may look like a sheep but it
eats like a dog what kind do you want
he wants a big one said alice
great dane or st bernard

  how about an irish wolfhound

  is that a big one daddy

  tallest in the book

  maybe we should choose that said
alice tentatively that is she corrected
herself if we choose any at all and i
rather doubt whether we should

  its up to you

  think of the cost of feeding a big
dog

  but i told you before it will probably
feed on the animals it kills

  suppose it doesnt kill any

  it had better said anthony thats
why i sent for the catalogue well have
to take a look at the qualities of the dif-
ferent breeds and not depend entirely on
smalls otherwise excellent criterion of
size we want a dog thats kind and af-
fectionate with a child tough adaptable
a good hunter and easy to care for there
are several that seem to fit the bill but
of course its hard to be sure from a cata-
logue alone and a lot depends on the in-
dividual dog too why not tell the dog
breeding station what we want and leave
the final choice up to them

  but were not sure-

  it was at that moment that for the first
time there came a scratching not at the
door but at the shutter

  alice looked at her husband and her
child and then hugged the latter closely
thank god youre home she told
anthony

  the shutters were not as resistant as the
doors and they both knew it but for the
moment the creature outside seemed to
have trouble making up its mind the
scratching stopped and then began again
at another shutter

  as long as it isnt at the door i have
a chance to slip out before it can slip in-
i hope said anthony he picked up his
monster	

gun jet small behind the other door
and bar it

  dont be silly ill put small there but
im staying here ill keep the explosive
gun in readiness just in case

  anthony nodded and said all right
then here i go

  he opened the door and stepped out
at the faint sound the door made the
scratching at the shutter stopped a second
later something seemed to flash through
the air and throw itself at anthonys face
anthony startled didnt pull the trigger
instead he swung the gun upward and
caught the creature in the middle throw-
ing it above the roof as it rose high he
aimed giving it a wide beam the creature
split in two and the pieces fell to the
ground where they wriggled spasmodic-
ally

the thing had possessed a long
snakes head and neck on a small
pseudo-mammalian body anthonys shot
had cut it at the base of the neck and as
the eyes glared at him he fired into the
head but even with the head shattered
the neck continued to twitch

  alice shuddered how did it fly

  get a little closer and youll see for
yourself	

  she managed to overcome her repulsion
and approached close still holding her own
gun in readiness and then as anthony
had said she savr for herself all along the
neck were small pairs of wings and on
the body two pairs of large ones they
were folded now but their nature was
clearly visible as if to leave her in no
doubt whatever during one of the twitell-
ings a pair on the body shuddered open
and revealed a five-foot wingspread before
it closed again

  what is it she asked

  lets get into the house before we talk
replied anthony and they withdrew quick-
ly and were about to bolt the door once
more

  at that moment alice looked around
and screamed small

  anthony opened the door again to find
that small had slipped out and was poking
with interest in his mind and a stick in
his hand at the body-half of the shattered

animal anthony grabbed him and carried
him in when they had bolted the door
again alice fell into a chair that child
gives me heart-failure a dozen times a
day

  thats what kids are for said ant-
hony about that thing i killed-ive
heard of them but ive never seen one be-
fore i hope they dont turn out to be
common around here

  if one finally found its way to us
others will sooner or later

  im afraid so he sighed theyre
known as snaffles-flying snakes it may
make you feel better to learn that theyre
not poisonous

  it doesnt make me feel better in the
least theyre horrible anyway

  well how about getting a dog
send away for one-at once any kind
so long as it will kill these terrible things
they sent away and then they waited
a week later anthony killed a badgerine
-a vicious burrowing animal that had the
habit of slaughtering for the pure joy
of killing the same day a report came
from t i tapling to the effect that the
central terrestrial dog breeding station
had reported an order for one of their ani-
mals and that by virture of the fact that
all orders for government personnel on
government projects must be routed
through government channels the order
had been turned over to mr tapling
however as mr tapling was strongly op-
posed to red tape-so said mr tapling
black on white-he would not return a
new blank order form to mr anthony
kidd but would save time according to
the procedure permitted by regulation
mnvx code  and fill out the
necessary form himself

  why the guys human said anthony
in surprise

  maybe he had a dog himself once
suggested alice

  whatever it is it shouldnt be long
now

  but mr tapling as an expediter was
not quite as efficient as when he played
the role of obstructor another week pas-
sed during which	va ittathtet
octerocap and two snaffles incurring a
slight wound from one of the latter the
	planet

wound showed signs at first of festering
badly and special biostatic treatment was
needed to keep it from getting worse the
week after that anthony shot a new ani-
mal which he had never even heard de-
scribed before it seemed a baggy formless
mass with a tiny almost invisible head
he tossed it aside and the other animals
enticed by the meal came to eat it and
then prowl audibly drooling around the
house he shot several more and still no
dog

  he spent part of his hard-earned salary
for a special cable to mr tapling and
that gentleman in his hatred of red tape
referred the message to a subordinate who
passed it on for action to a subordinate
of his own anthony never heard of the
cable again

during the next week he killed no
less than five different animals alice
herself killed a snaffle which tried to get
into the house through an imperfectly
barred window the explosive gun was a
great success blowing head and most of
the neck to bits with one shot and knock-
ing alice to the floor at the same time by
means of the recoil she was bruised for
days and from that moment she lived in
almost as great terror of the gun itself as
of the animals outside

  in the month that followed anthony
sent a cable each week and received no
reply to any of them the number of ani-
mals that prowled around the house in-
creased almost daily there came the day
when alice called up the mine in panic

  anthony there are three of them out-
side the house all at once one at the
door two at different shutters rush home
and bring help

  okay said anthony and rushed

  this time he was accompanied by one
of his fellow engineers who was carrying
a surprise for alice the first surprise
however was the one that anthony him-
self received tunneling under the con-
crete foundation of the house was a bad-
gerine whose presence alice had not even
suspected but anthony had no time to
tackle it for the other animals were quick-
ly upon him the first to arrive were the
snaffles and both anthony and the en-

tories

gineer with him aimed and shot in a hurry
anthonys target fell apart as scheduled
the engineers kept on coming but for-
tunately overshot its mark for its intend-
ed victim had fallen to the ground

  anthony swung his gun around knock-
ed the snaffle into the air and fired right
into the middle of an octerocap rushing at
him it fell to the ground eight heads
howling and then managed to lift itself
and spring but by this time the engineer
was on his feet again and while he broke
its back with a blow of his own gun
anthony disposed of the remaining snaf-
fle

  it was only then that they heard the
shriek from inside the badgerine was
cutting through the concrete and getting
into the house anthony rushed to the
door it was bolted and alice terrified
as she watched the floor give way either
didnt hear his yells or was unable to get
to him anthony wasted no time in pound-
ing at the closed door he rushed to the
hole the badgerine had dug and crawled
down after it

  the hole was dark but fortunately fair-
ly wide as the badgerine was a large ani-
mal anthony was able to pull himself
along at a fair rate of speed while he was
still a dozen feet from the concrete he
heard the explosive gun go off he almost
felt the shock that must have hit alice
and tried to crawl faster but only scraped
his face against the rock actually it was
only a few seconds before he reached the
concrete and dragged himself through but
it seemed like hours

  alice had turned on the brightest lights
and thoroughly shaken by the recoil was
now trying to aim with an unsteady gun
at the badgerine which had pulled itself
together as if gathering strength to spring
at her the explosion had torn a hole in
its side and blood was staining the floor
-but it wasnt the wound that had saved
alice from its first attempt to pounce up-
on her it was the bright light which daz-
zled the eyes so well adjusted tothe black
of the tunnel it had leaped by odor and
missed and alice had been cool enough
to hold her fire until she could aim but
this time the animal would not miss

  it sprang in fact just as anthony drag-
monster	

ged his own gun to aiming position and
its teeth were about to close on her throat
when his blast drilled it through the pri-
mary heart even as it fell it knocked
her down

anthony kicked the animal aside
and picked up his wife who had
fainted outside the man who had ac-
companied him was pounding on the door
from behind the bolted door of the inner
room small was wailing

  anthony deposited his wife gently on a
sofa and let his friend in the man said
jitterly that idiot tapling

  never mind tapling let me have your
flask

  but alice didnt need the whisky to re-
vive she opened her eyes just as anthony
lifted her again and then as her gaze met
his own she sighed what a wonderful
man i married always just in time
that idiot tapling growled the new-
comer

  alice looked at him questioningly and
anthony said this is carl dowley from
the mines he came along when i told
him that i might need help and look at
what he has

  a new gun exclaimed alice

  thats what it looks like said dowley
from surplus courtesy of regulation
nd-z and thats exactly what it isnt
he said to anthony you saw me aim and
fire but you didnt see anything happen
because it didnt go off

  let me take a look at it anthony
opened it up and stared no loader no
radiation shield no charge chamber-the
guts are missing

  they looked at each other and all three
said at the same moment almost as if they
had rehearsed it that idiot tapling

  it was only then that alice heard smalls
wailing and opened the inner door

  they had thought that day was bad
enough the next day topped it

  the hole the badgerine had dug had been
filled with quick-setting concrete and had
no further attraction for animal visitors
late in the afternoon however something
came to the door and alice tried to phone
the mine but the line was dead and she

realized that some aftima probably an-
other badgerine had cut through the con-
crete and metal shield that protected the
phone and visor wires she was not seri-
ously upset however-not then she
simply switched to the radio sender and
tried to contact the mine along her private
wave-length it was only when she real-
ized that the power was not on that panic
really gripped her

  the creature at the door kept working
steadily as if unaware that a half hour
after its arrival a competitor had arrived
at one of the shutters and that a pretty
race was on to see which would get alice
as its prey she stared at her watch and
tried to guess when anthony would be
coming home probably as far as she
could estimate a half hour after the first
creature had reached her she might stop
it with the explosive gun and she might
not and then if another showed up at
the same window or door while she was
still unsteady from the recoil   

  her only hope was that they would
come after her one by one not too close
together she considered seriously the pos-
sibility of opening the shutter to allow the
entrance of the snaffle which she was sure
was tearing at it getting rid of that and
then closing the shutter again while she
recovered her steadiness but she knew
that the thing might come at her faster
than she could handle it and decided to
leave the shutter alone

  for another half hour the animals work-
ed away each intent upon its own means
of arriving at the victim then for the
first time alice heard the sound of a
struggle between animals outside the house
the scratching at the shutter stopped
there came a thin shriek a crash against
the side and then silence except for the
vibration of the shutter

  the scratching at the door stopped next
this time there came the howling of oc-
terocap heads and then a crash high up
as if the creature had been hurled with
great force against the house the thing
that had hurled it next pounded on the
door and to her horror alice saw the door
yield at the same time both at the bot-
tom and at the top as if it had been hit
jy both head and foot at once never

stories

before had any animal been large enough
to accomplish such a feat this must be a
predator of a new type huger and stronger
than the others

  for the second time in two days alice
fainted

she was awakened a little later
by a great pounding on the door at
first she thought she would faint again
but the unexpected sound of anthonys
voice reassured her he was yelling to her
to open up

  she lifted the bolt and anthony step-
ped toward her as she fell forward to
fling her arms around his neck however
she caught sight of something over his
shoulder    she closed her eyes and
shrieked

  take it easy said anthony he may
look frightening but hes of a breed thats
been trained to be gentle with humans

  its-

  its the thing that smashed the snaffle
and trampled the octerocap its the dog
they sent us

  she drew back and a monster stepped
into the room its clumsy gait almost knock-
ing the door off its hinges it gazed at her
with saucer eyes and then as small came
toward it his own little eyes wide with
a puzzled sort of delight the dog stretched
out a tongue bigger than smalls head and
tried to lick smalls face the boy fell
over backward squalling in fright

  no rover said anthony sternly

  the dog hung its head in shame

  down rover

  the dog stood motionless anthony
smacked him on the rear the dog squat-
ted down on his haunches his head some-
where near the ceiling

  see how gentle he is he may look like
a monster but he wouldnt lay a paw or a
tooth on a human being they breed his
kind for gentleness

  but-are you sure its a dog how-
why didnt you-

  i tried to call you late this afternoon
when he arrived said anthony reason-
ably but the wire was cut and your
radio wasnt receiving so i set out to walk
him home had him on a leash not that
i could hold him if he really tried to pull
monster	

away but he wont exert his full force
against a human who has him on a leash
then how did he get away if he
killed the octerocap and the snaffle he
must have got here before you

  he did fact is i was careless con-
fessed anthony shamefacedly i stopped
to light a cigaret and he tugged the leash
out of my hand before i could get a good
grip on it he headed for this place be-
cause it was the only human-looking habi-
tation in the neighborhood good thing
too he got here in time to take care of
those creatures

  alice stared at the monster good
heavens how big is he anyway

  seven feet at the shoulder and weighs
 pounds no wonder he could handle
those animals even though he is a pup
a pup

  four months old two months when
they shipped him out it seems that the
-catalogue that idiot tapling sent us is a
little out of date in the past few cen-
turies theyve bred new kinds of dogs en-
tirely different from those they used to
have on earth theyve got them small
enough to fit into a thimble and big
enough-well as big as this one will be
naturally when we wrote away and asked
for a protector type one of the biggest
they had we didnt have any idea that
theyd developed this if tapling had only
sent us a modern catalogue-

  i like him announced small suddenly
is his name rover

  absolutely

  will he knock me over again

  of course not that was just an ac-
cident

  are we going to keep him 

  anthony looked at alice and grinned
i dont think we have any choice in the
matter its a question of life and death
but not in the house said alice
theres no room for him in the house
and hell be quite safe outside

  im afraid not said anthony hes
strong but as a pup hes still delicate
yery susceptible to virus infections

  that elephant exclaimed alice in-

credulously afraid of little things like
viruses 

   anthony nodded his kind catch cold
very easily after he grows older of
course hell be different hell be able to
sleep outside if you make him a chest
protector the chest has to stay warm
you used to knit well alice

   i cant knit a chest protector for an
 elephant

youre exaggerating even full-grown
he probably wont top  pounds some
elephants come a lot bigger than that
ill sew him a protector out of an old
blanket i wont knit it

   i guess that will do meanwhile as i
 said well have to keep him in the house
 and about food- he coughed delicately
 later on hell be able to supply himself
 meanwhile hes still a pup as i must keep
 on reminding you well have to buy
 special dogfood and vitamin concentrates
 a few gallons a year no more hell be
 mature at about two

   alice groaned he probably saved my
life but i cant help it anthony i cant
welcome him like the guest he should be
either hell eat us out of house and home
or hell crowd us out-

  i can take him back or give him to
someone else observed anthony i al-
ready have an offer

  no-im afraid we need him too
much she looked at the animal grimly
and said you win rover youre one
of the family

  rover bent his head and anthony
scratched it small said daddy could he
give me a ride and anthony put the
boy on the dogs back and watched him
parade clumsily around the room knocking
over no more than two chairs a moment
later the boy slipped off beaming

   i think itll work out said anthony
 as if in answer smalls eyes seemed to
 pop out of his head while his finger
 pointed alice shrieked and in her voice
 there was the expression of stark tragedy
 such as aristotle had never known of the
 ultimate outrage of a malignant and re-
 morseless fate he isnt housebroken

instantly she teas running
firing her gun as she went   a

the crippled ship scream-

ed down toward venus upright in
a slow axial spin riding silent jets
grey cloud curved sleekly past the fins
streamed up in trembling ribbons along
the shining sides at the noseport war-
ren blackwell strained his eyes in an ef-
fort to pierce that boiling greyness but he
knew the venusian atmosphere knew he
was wasting his time he would see the
ground when the ship was fifty feet above
it and that would be far too late

  the door of the control room clicked
and the girl who sat at the other end of
the table from him at meal-times entered
and came up to him

  the captain sent me in case i could



help she said

  and to get you out of the way

 she grinned without humor nc
doubt

  whats your name he asked
virginia stuart you might as well call
me virginia theres not much time left
for formality is there    youre black-
well arent you-the blackwell

  if you mean the one who won all the
medals yes how many are there left
of the crew the captain and his sec-
ond officer and the captains weaving
about a bit it wont be long before the
radiation gets him too

  warren surveyed her and decided she
could take the truth go back and get one
you are strug-
gling through the weird
mist-shrouded jungles of venus

	  ahead of you too far lie the
warmly glowing lights of city four    be-
hind you too close silently stalks the most es
rible death in the system

of them out he told her itll only need
one to jam on all the power there is left
when i ring for it but there must be one
it isnt much of a chance but its the
only one weve got

  check she said isnt the phone
working 

  no only the alarm

she nodded and left him warreh
strained again to pierce the grey doud
he was a passenger on the merkland but
he had been co-opted when the power-
leak developed he knew more than any of
the crew about venus not that that made
much difference all that he could do was

stay where he was and sound the alarm
when he saw the ground then down
below whoever was left would touch off
the braking jets and with luck the ship
would come down hard but in one piece
but it would need a lot of luck

  there wouldnt be much hope for any
one who was below warren right in the
nose probably stood the best chance after
the rest of the passengers who were
locked in a store-room amidships none
of the other passengers would have been
much help and apparently the captain had
picked out him and the girl as the only
ones who might be useful in the emer-
gency he seemed a brave and able officer

stories

  that captain he could have stayed in the
nose himself safe if anyone was and left
the problem of the leaking radiation to
someone else but he knew that only he
or some other member of his crew could
handle the jets and that it was vital that
they should fire exactly when needed

  the girl came back and captain mor-
ris was with her i make it twenty thou-
sand feet up blackwell said morris do
you think that would be about right
virginia hadnt exaggerated when she
said the captain was weaving about a bit
he was in the last stages of plutonium
poisoning warren thought a trifle cyni-
cally that the captain might as well go
on being a hero now for he wat a dead
man already but warren was used to
death the rows of ribbons somewhere in
his luggage proclaimed that

  i never flew much over venus he
admitted nobody does id say we were
well up yet on a long slant but dont
quote me

  the captain sank heavily into one of
the control seats he could never stop his
shaking now but he could limit it by try-
ing to relax we can blast for five sec-
onds i make it he said that means at
our speed we should start a hundred and
twenty feet up

  warren shook his head you might see
a hundred and twenty feet on the surface
but not straight down its thickest about
sixty feet up

  thats why i came to see you were
in your hands blackwell you know more
about these currents than anyone else on
board youll have to guess thats all the
instruments arent anywhere near that pre-
cise and if you wait till you see solid
ground itll be too late someone has to
guess it might as well be you

  warren nodded morris hoisted him-
self to his feet he paused at the door
goodbye he said

  warren was left with the girl now
youve got a chance to win another medal
she said

  i could live without it when the ve-
nusian war was over i thought id finished
with danger

  youre never finished with danger
it follows a brave man around

  maybe murmured warren but im
not a brave man never was

er eyes widened but she said
nothing she had never met warren
blackwell before this trip in fact she
hadnt officially met him on the trip until
she introduced herself a few minutes be-
fore but like everyone else she had read
of him while the war was on a man who
treated his life as a millionaire might treat
a dime he found in his shoe it wasnt that
he was lucky or so clever that the dan-
gers were always less real than they
seemed he had been wounded scores of
times and captured twice and no one else
had escaped from the greys even once
he would drop out of the news for a
couple of months while he was recovering
from injury then he would be back with
some new exploit that made it seem he
was determined to get himself killed

  was that it she wondered looking at
him as he peered through the big quartz
windows had he cared so little for life
that his courage had really been resigna-
tion she had read that he had come from
an orphanage even a hint that he had been
in a reform school but details like that
werent publicized about a hero

  it wasnt that she decided the man
beside her was passionately fond of life
she could see it in the way his whole body
concentrated on the job in hand he wasnt
trying to save her and the others if that
had been the case he would have been
cold and steady he was trying to save
himself-and the rest of them as a sort of
afterthought

  he shook himself suddenly and turrted
from the window itll be a few minutes
yet he said and if i watch much longer
ill get jumpy and ring for the jets too
soon you wouldnt like to do a strip
act to pass the time

  thats not at all funny she said cool-
ly he watched her broodingly and saw
she thought less of him than she had a
moment before it was that easy to lose
admiration and respect

  she was a tough-looking girl workman-
like rather than pretty but she was suffi-
ciently versatile to make herself attractive
too for no more reason perhaps than
venus mission	

that of the man who doesnt intend to go
out or see anyone but still shaves and
brushes his hair she wore dark slacks
and a heavy blue shirt and though her
outfit didnt suggest any particular beauty
of figure it didnt absolutely deny it she
had light brown hair and a strong young
face the features were good and if they
were too full of character for beauty
they were just right for a certain subtle
elegance it was a pity to see a woman
like that die there werent too many of
them

  what do you do he asked

  ive done a lot of things at the mo-
ment im on government work
which government

  uno theres nothing secret about
it im 

  she broke off as warrei turned back
to the window im beginning to get a
feeling about this he murmured we
should be somewhere over the norman
forest but we were slanting a long time
i think we almost hit an orbit maybe we
overshot to the norman hills in which
case- his voice sank to nothing-i
should sound the alarm now

  virginia wasnt prepared her eyes
darted to warrens hand pressing hard
down on the button then flashed to the
window where there was a sudden break
in the grey mist a blinding flash and a
glimpse of a whirling black mass outside
as the floor kicked up at her she realized
that by luck or divination warren had
picked on the right split-second

the crash dazed her but she never
lost consciousness warren did she
saw him shoot forward toward the win-
dow and caught him by one ankle she
didnt stop him but he crashed against
the quartz with less force virginia heard
a scream of metal on stone that mounted
until her ears refused to take it and told
her nothing more

  then gradually she realized that the
ship was down probably as safely as it
could have been she looked out but
there was nothing but grey mist and black
soil she had been on venus before but
never out in the open only in the domed
cities nevertheless she knew it was full

day there was about as much light as
on a misty moonlit night on earth and
visibility was about forty yards which was
as light as it ever was on venus

  warren was stirring he wakened as
she expected him to waken quietly doing
nothing until he had had a look around

  you stopped me crashing through the
window he said ill do something for
you sometime

  youve done it you got us down

  he rose unsteadily wed better let
the others out he said

  by tacit agreement they looked for the
captain first but he the second officer
and any other members of the crew who
hadnt actually been dead before the land-
ing were crushed in a flat envelope of steel
which had once been the drive room they
couldnt get near them which was per-
haps just as well they made their way
to the store-room and unlocked the door

  it hadnt been a bad landing in the
circumstances there had been fifteen peo-
ple in the room and seven of them were
still alive though two would never recover
consciousness as it happened they would
have been safer in the nose with warren
and virginia but no one could have known
that

  warren took stock of them ignoring
the moans and screams he ignored the
dead too if they were dead it didnt mat-
ter whether they were unmarked or a dis-
gusting pulp it was the living who mat-
tered waters the actor was bleeding
from mouth and ears in a way that showed
he was still alive his wife was breathing
which was rather horrible for her neck
was obviously broken

the other five were almost un-
hurt fortunately the doctor wil-
liamson was on his feet and looked sane
and well standing beside him apparently
only dazed was old martin wiio was
ninety and had come through the crash
as well as anyone three others were stir-
ring on the floor and smith with a broken
wrist seemed to be the most seriously in-
jured though it was the women who were
doing most of the screaming and moan-
ing

  mrs martin could hardly be blamed
	planet

for like most of those in the room she
had lost some of her clothes in a blast
of air which must have swept the room
and was probably screaming more at find-
ing herself half-naked in company at the
age of seventy-five than anything else but
the glamour girl whose name warren
didnt know was screaming only because
she always screamed when anything hap-
pened warren had met girls like her
before and had not been impressed

  at the evidence of a blast of air war-
ren looked round quickly and sniffed but
the ship was airtight there was no hiss
of escaping air and the pressure was high
-too high if anything perhaps there had
been a rift which had immediately been
sealed by the weight and momentum of
the ship there were cracks and holes
in the inner walls but they were not as
strong as the hull

  all right doctor he asked you
take over

  doesnt look as if theres much i can
do said williamson wryly

  dont be modest warren said the
doctor stared blankly and virginia shot
a quick glance at warren he had gone
down in her estimation again he decided

  glamour was tugging at his lapel and
screaming get me out of here get me
out

  into the open he asked coolly
youd die in eight hours but long be-
fore that the greys would have got you

  she hadnt heard him she was still
screaming get me out of here her
dress had a spectacular plunging neckline
as if rent open by the blast but it was
natural her hair wasnt even dishevelled
she was completely unmarked and very
beautiful which was a pity warren
thought for she didnt deserve to be bet-
ter people had died in the crash

  virginia pulled her gently away from
him you said something about the nor-
man hills do you know where we are

  its only a guess he admitted but
i think i do almost exactly if im any-
where near right at all

  hows that

  were lying up a bare slope on soft
soil but we hit rock first and if we came
down roughly straight we just missed

stories

the forest that puts us somewhere on a
narrow belt twenty to thirty miles from
city four-cefor for short

  and how are our chances

  he looked round at the others now
silent and hanging on his words even
glamour and mrs martin whose husband
had wrapped her in his jacket there was
no point in letting it out slowly might as
well get it over with

  our chances must be better now than
they were when we were coming down
he said deliberately but youd need a
slide-rule and a lot of figures to prove it

there was a moments silence while
they worked out his meaning then
glamour threw herself at him screaming
and scratching at his face as though he
personally were responsible for their
plight 

  virginia seized his arm as he was fend-
ing glamour off none too gently and
pulled him away lets go and check
up she said he grinned her opinion
of him might be dropping and would
probably drop more very soon but after
all he was the only one with whom she
could talk seriously the safety of them
all depended on him and her

  she led him back to the observation
room

  it cant be as bad as you made out
she said

  why not

  surely they must have seen us come
down theres bound to be a search or
at worst surely one of us can get through
if its only twenty miles

  im not just deliberately being pessimis-
tic he said i want to live too but lets
take it from the beginning the captain
would corroborate if he were here one
they couldnt see us in cefor we didnt
come over it we were pointing roughly
toward it and they couldnt see a flam-
ing meteor at five miles let alone us at
twenty radar doesnt work in this soup
any more than in water and a seismo-
graph wouldnt help because there are so
many quakes on venus no one will be
even interested in the shock we made on
landing

  two we were bound for new paris
venus mission



in the other hemisphere of venus and
when a search starts in about twenty-
four hours from now theyll concentrate
around there first at a rough guess it will
be six months before they find this ship
remember theyve got to explore almost
every inch of ground a helicopter has to
be within a stonesthrow before it can see
us

  the girl stared but any time theres
a forced landing the passengers are picked
up before theres any real danger-even
if the ship is breached and they have to
breathe that poison outside i always
thought the only danger was getting down
safely

  yes said warren gently usually
but usually the radio doesnt crack up
first-before the ship ours did so no
one knows where we are

  oh i see but we cant wait six
months well all be dead in a week they
don-t carry much in the way of stores
on these ships

  he nodded thats about the size of
it

  she shrugged well we just have to
get on the way to cefor then 

  not me if im going to die ill die
here

  she shot a puzzled glance at him i
dont understand you you used to be a
hero youve done harder things than this
trek to cefor you got medals for it

he smiled bleakly no you
dont understand i told you i was
no hero before the war i was nothing
nobody id tried a few things and failed
in them all i tried crime two or three
times and failed in that too when the
war started i realized it was my last
chance in peace i had nothing to look
forward to but starvation or jail so i
thought id buy me a job i became a pro-
fessional hero i didnt give a damn if i
died but if i got through i was pretty
sure of some sort of job civilians arent
grateful for long but a collection of every
medal they mint ought to be a recommen-
dation just after the war i thought and
i was right i had my choice of jobs i
joined an importing firm and ive done
well

  i was a hero once but that was when
i had to risk my life to buy a life worth
living i bought it and paid for it but
when you gamble like that you do it only
once im not going to throw away all i
worked for trying to get through to cefor
sure i know the greys i beat them be-
fore but that was then now id rather
stay here and take my chance of being
rescued than give them another crack at
me

  she looked steadily at him for a long
time then she shook her head maybe
im wrong to say it she murmured but
you werent twisted before youre only
twisted now youve gone soft

  sure ive gone soft i risked my life
time and again so that one day id have a
chance to go soft

  well if you wont go i must

  he shrugged his shoulders please
yourself

  she made a gesture of disgust heaven
knows i never thought id appeal to chiv-
alry i never cried off or made excuses
because im a woman but-

  it doesnt matter the greys will get
whoever tries it

  i thought the war was over

  sure it is but out there you wont find
the civilized greys the greys who will
get you never signed any treaty they
wont attack the cities but theyll attack
anything or anyone outside

  she turned to the closet that contained
the oxygen suits i might as well go now
warren watched her as she shook out
the plastic envelope obviously unfamiliar
to her and tried to climb into it then
he put his hand on her arm

  i cant let you go without telling you
exactly why you shouldnt he said

  she shook his arm off and struggled
with the suit

  first of all though its only a detail
he remarked you dont wear heavy
clothes under that youd sweat off pounds
before youd gone a hundred yards most
of us used to wear nothing but the suit
but if you dont like that wear something
light and loose

she began to take off the suit again
youll have no difficulty in finding the
city  he said its right up the hill keep
	planet

  on the incline and you cant go wrong if
  you have to make a detour just get back
  on the slope as soon as you can

   he paused youll have even less diffi-
culty in finding the greys

she waited for him to go on hat-
ing him but utterly dependent on his
knowledge of venus

  no native venusians have any sense
of smell he said so to replace scent
in hunting they have a sense that feels
thought

  he saw her start and grinned they
can locate anything that thinks theyre
not telepaths they dont know what you
think any more than dogs hearing voices
know whats being said they just know
theres thinking going on in such-and-such
a direction and from the kind of thinking
they know the kind of creature thats doing
it so it doesnt matter what you think
about theyll pick you up

  he smiled again cruelly she thought
when they do find you they wont kill
you right away theyll follow you and
let you catch a glimpse of one of them
now and then and harry you and frighten
you half to death but theyll let you get
right to the gates of cefor ever seen a
cat torturing a mouse the greys are
just like that at the very last minute
when you think youre safe theyll drag
you off into the forest and torture you to
death maybe theyll let you escape two
or three times but at last theyll tire
she twisted from him angrily certain
she had heard all that would be of any
use to her she left the room to go to her
cabin and change her clothes but as
silently as a cat he had followed her

  listen carefully to what happens then
he said for its very important

  she tried to pass him but he leaned
with one arm on either side of her hold-
ing her against the wall

  they wont let you die theyll muti-
late you with their knives so that youre
bound to die so that the best doctors on
earth venus and mars couldnt save you
so that youre in agony but will still live
quite a while then theyll take you to
the nearest city-in this case cefor
theyll leave you there it amuses them

stories

that we humans dont kill our own people
even when they want to die youll die
in a hospital bed heavily drugged but still
not enough to stop all the pain

  he let her go for she was listening
again in horrified fascination but that
isnt important he said casually what
is important is that you can tell them about
us well all be grateful to you we may
erect a statue to you youll die but in
dying you can save us

  he turned and left her then she stared
after him in horror her horror for the
greys a little less strong than her horror
for him

arren was waiting at the
airlock as she came back he grinned
at her she was almost literally sick the
worst of it was that he was almost certain-
ly right she had to make the effort as
no one else would make it he knew that
he could afford to let her do it and he
would be saved she would tell them at
cefor about the ship he wasnt alone
there were other lives to be saved
warren surveyed her and nodded
youre all right he said can you use
a gun

  she nodded involuntarily take an-
other he said they wont give you
time to reload he gave her a gun which
she slipped in her belt she had changed
into lounging pajamas which were en-
veloping but so thin she shivered in the
normal temperature of the ship over
them the plastic suit covered her loosely
completely held firmly by the belt that
contained her weapons

  unwillingly she addressed him is
there no way of screening thoughts from
the greys

  only by thinking like a grey yourself
only about half a dozen people ever
learned to do it-and they cant keep it up
for long

  she fought a shrieking urge in her to
beg him to go instead of her she believed
all he had said-she expected to die but
she also believed that if she stayed where
she was she would die no one else would

go-

  good luck said warren

  blindly insanely she struck at him but
venus mission

ho evaded her blow and helped her into

the airlock

  when she went out the heat met her
as if an oven door had been swung open
the ships hull was insulated against both
cold and heat usually it was cold it kept
out but on venus it was damp warmth
virginias suit was supposed to afford
some sort of insulation but before she was
out of sight of the ship she was wet all
over with sweat

  she took one last look at the ship as
she climbed up the slope it was only
fifty yards away she could still turn and
go back she was beginning to realize
something that stemmed from what war-
ren had said she could always find cefor
-but she couldnt find the ship again
once she lost sight of it going downhill
might land her anywhere along the perim-
eter once she had lost all sense of direc-
tion-which would be almost at once

  she tried to think calmly of warren he
must have known from the first that if he
wouldnt try to get through to cefor she
would she wasnt the sort to sit still and
wait for death

  and the savage inhuman customs of the
greys ensured that only one had to go
hate for warren crawled in her stomach
the worst of it was she believed he might
have got through safe she still believed
in his competence somehow if he had
had to he would have reached safety

  but he didnt have to risk it there was
someone to risk it for him a girl but
that didnt matter to a man who had lost
pride

  she walked on for what seemed hours
until she was as wet as if she had just
stepped out of a hot bath her watch
showed sixty-three minutes since she left
the ship she had been walking briskly
over four miles she had always been a
good walker and the slighter gravity
helped

  then she struck the forest beginning
again on the slope venusian trees were
like those of earth in that they consisted
mainly of a thick trunk but that was all
the resemblance you could push an arm
through them and they closed round it
but they werent dangerous a man could



walk right through them if he was strong

  virginia began to hope despite herself
that she wouldnt see any greys she
fell into the rhythm of her stride walking
like an automaton she was tough she
could do twenty miles without coming to
the end of her strength the only difficulty
was the eternal slope but even that she
became accustomed to

  she had done ten miles she reckoned
when ahead of her right in her path she
saw a grey he was facing her only twen-
ty yards away her gun came up and
she fired but she was not surprised when
he faded into the mist and disappeared
unharmed

so it had started there would
be a lot of this according to warren
the greys were humanoid like half-
finished men they had no hair but they
had arms legs feet a trunk and a head
everything about them was rounded off-
shoulders thighs feet they were a uni-
form grey all over and invisible on their
own planet at anything more than twenty
yards they could be in plain sight and
only had to turn or move back a step to
disappear completely

  she began to plan perhaps she could
beat them on what warren had told her
nothing mattered apparently until she
was almost at cefor she would have to
save herself till then greys could run a
little faster than most humans but not
much and she used to be able to do the
hundred yards in well under twelve sec-
onds civilized greys had civilized weap-
ons but these were probably unarmed
except for knives if she could pick her
time right for a dash to the city she might
make it

  she began to reel a little and slowed her
pace knowing she was observed perhaps
she might trick them into leaving the final
attack till too late she could rest a little
now it was only the last mile that mat-
tered

  she staggered and fell she rose slowly
in artistic fatigue but she almost jerked
into her sprint when she saw four greys
calmly watching her from only ten yards

  she shot rapidly and one of them fell
the others didnt appear to care but
	planet

they disappeared if only just beyond her
range of vision

   she ran a little then in terror that wa
only a little less real than she pretended
but the control she still had on herself
enabled her to stumble on tiredly at hardly
more than walking pace

  her hopes were beginning to rise
twelve miles she was still fresh and
the greys must think her almost out on
her feet they must let her see cefor or
their devilish torture wouldnt be com-
plete and if they let her get that far she
might be able to dash for the gates and
then hold them off until men came out
attracted by her shots

  she pondered over firing early in the
hope that she would give the alarm but
almost certainly that would precipitate the
greys attack and she wanted to trick
them into leaving it until the last possible
moment

  suddenly something crashed between
her legs throwing her headlong she
wasnt hurt but when she got up she
limped they were playing into her hands
warren had done this she thought twice
he had escaped from the greys and per-
haps he hadnt known as much as she did
now

  they left her alone for quite a while
she saw nothing of them for so long that
she almost began to hope that they had
tired and left her alone but she kept her
slow pace they might be trying to trick
her into showing she was stronger than
she pretended

  when she least expected it she was
bowled over from behind and felt the
touch of warm moist skin she gave her-
self up to terror and thought this is it
but they only rolled her about gently
played with her and tripped her again
every time she rose there seemed to be
about a dozen of them she was afraid
to try to shoot them her guns were
secure if she left them where they were
but if she drew one they might knock
it from her hand

  at last they were gone they had torn
her suit but only the pantaloon part she
was puzzled then realized why without
oxygen she would die in eight hours and
would be beyond recovery in six they

stories

knew that and they wanted her to live
longer

she cut her suit away at the
waist below her belt it left her legs
freer her thin slacks clung to her legs
so that by now they almost seemed a part
of her she wondered what they would
do if she threw away the rest of the suit
would they put it back on her forcibly

  she knew she must have done nearly
twenty miles and wished warren had
overestimated the distance he had said
twenty to thirty miles and she had been
unable to prevent herself hoping it was the
smaller limit but there was no sign of
cefor yet

  two of them would have had a much
better chance she thought angrily they
could have watched all round them and
kept the greys more on the defensive as
it was the greys were so silent that a
score of them could be walking only a
few yards behind her she resisted the
temptation to look until she was set to
do it quickly ready to take a shot at any-
thing she saw

  when she had swung round she wished
she hadnt at least a score of dark shapes
faded rapidly into the fog now he
would always know they were there be-
hind her within sight if she turned her
head it was enough to drive her mad

  the greys could see only about thirty
or forty yards-even less than she could
if the mist would only lift she knew she
could see them long before they could see
her but the mist never lifted it was the
atmosphere of the planet there was a lot
of oxygen in it but there were other
things in it too

  suddenly she saw a faint glow ahead
she forced herself to be cold as ice the
bright lights of the domed city would
carry a long way even through the fog
it might be anything up to a mile distant
yet though probably not more than half a
mile this was the time warren had
warned her about the time when she
began to think she was through she
forced herself to stumble slowly on she 
nursed a faint hope that as the greys 
probably couldnt actually see the city yet
though they would know where it was
venus

mission



they might leave her alone for a while
yet

  she went staggering on thinking over
and over again not yet not yet as her
body rebelled and tried to run toward the
light

  then she saw the greys closing in in-
stantly she was running firing her gun
as she went she didnt care where the
bullets went but she realized in rending
disappointment that the mist blanketed
sound as well as sight and she was still
too far away for the sound to be heard
in cefor

  but she was holding her lead she went
wild with exultation and threw her empty
gun away even its weight held her back
and as she raced toward the light she told
herself she had won the greys had un-
derestimated her as she had been inviting
them to do for hours

  suddenly she heard a scream behind
her a womans scream it was so un-
expected that she checked her stride in-
voluntarily she took it up again at once
the scream was another of the greys
tricks

  then it came again and there were
words it was no grey she heard behind
her a human girl was screaming as she
was dragged down again virginia
couldnt help checking her stride but
then furious with herself she renewed
her efforts it must be yvonne yonge
who was screaming somehow for some
reason the little glamour girl had set out
after her that was too bad virginias
duty to herself to the rest of them even
to yvonne was to reach cefor she burst
forward as if she had merely been trot-
ting gently before

  but the greys were at her heels she
never knew whether she would have es-
caped if yvonnes scream hadnt checked
her or whether the greys would have
caught her anyway either way they had
her

she fought as she had never known
she could fight as she had never
known anyone could fight if there had
only been ten of them even twenty she
might have broken free again and again
until at last she reached cefor but there

were scores of them perhaps hundreds
when she broke from one group she was
in the middle of another

  she stopped fighting at last thinking she
had no strength left but when they began
to drag her away from the lights of cefor
she found a reserve of strength that she
hadnt known about it made no differ-
ence

  she didnt see yvonne if it had been
yvonne she was dragged for what seemed
miles the greys were very gentle with
her they took all she was able to give
them rather than scratch her skin now
they folded her up at the foot of a tree
holding her so that she went down easily
naturally then they tied vines about her
neck

  for a moment virginia half hoped half
feared that they were going to throttle
her but instead they wound the rope
about her throat holding her plastic suit
tight against her skin then they cut the
suit neatly below the rope fastened the
plastic edge firmly against her skin with
an adhesive binding and removed the
rope

  obviously they wanted her to go on
breathing through the filter in her hood
but to have the rest of her accessible they
reached over her and she flinched expect-
ing them to strip her but they only tied
her hands and ankles and patted her all
over making sure she had no concealed
weapons

  then they left her in a moment there
wasnt a grey in sight

  she was helpless even to damage her-
self she could roll on her side and rub
her plastic hood on the ground in an effort
to tear it and let the poisonous air reach
her lungs-but that would take hours
and she didnt think she would be left
alone that long

  dont say i didnt warn you said
warren

her head jerked up but she
couldnt see him then fantastically
his head appeared from the tree beside
her he was standing within it

  warren blackwell she gasped you
here

  ive never been more than a hundred
	planet

  yards away since you left the ship he
said sorry virginia it was the only
way it could be done ive got the trick
of thinking like a grey but it would
never fool the greys for hours at a time
they would sense the human thoughts-
unless there was another human about
thinking like a human

  he grinned down at her i told you
they couldnt read thoughts that wasnt
quite right they can read emotions-like
fear and they would know if you ex-
pected to get through theyd have won-
dered what you were counting on then
theyd have found me

  but   

  they rely on this sense of theirs-
just as dogs rely on scent rather than sight
they werent likely to see me and they
didnt and if that little fool glamour
hadnt interfered wed both have got
through i meant to get just ahead of you
then when the greys finally decided to
take you id llave helped you to cut and
shoot your way through

  but glamour spoiled it god knows
what she was trying to do i told them
all to stay where they were that wed get
through maybe she thought it was easy
and wanted some of the glory anyway
i didnt know about her until a few min-
utes ago she was behind us both and
there were so many greys between you
and her i had to hide

  well dont waste time said virginia
cut me loose and well-

  no can do theyd pick you up again
long before we got to cefor-whether we
looked for glamour or left her here and
then theyd know about me no theres
only one way ill have to wait until
theres less of them between here and
cefor and then try to get through myself
ill be back

  can you get through alone

  i think so im safe so long as im
near you by the time they sense me itll
be too late but listen virginia if they
sense us coming back-men from cefor
and i-theyll drag you and glamour away
and thatll be the end of you you must
keep them here

  i she nodded at her bonds what
do you expect me to do

stories

  thats up to you he paused went
on tensely theyll start torturing you
soon that will occupy them theyll be
too excited to know were coming dont
be noble let them start on that little fool
dont try to escape they might not bring
you back here

  he grinned again i think i can start
now good luck-again

he faded away into the mist
virginia stared after him though
she could see nothing if he had only told
her    but she realized he probably told
the truth when he said he hadnt dared
knowing he was about she would have
been sure she would get through safely-
though she had hated him she had never
doubted his competence-and then the
greys would have caught them both

  there was sound again in the silence
of the mist they were bringing in yvonne
-glamour as warren called her she
was shouting kicking clawing and the
greys werent handling her as gently as
they had handled virginia perhaps they
had some respect for courage virginia
thought she had never been in a blue
funk as yvonne was maybe it was be-
cause of that that they had been gentle
with her

  and perhaps-she couldnt help think-
ing of it-perhaps they would work on
yvonne first

  it seemed like a dream-not a night-
mare yet for the greys looked ludicrous
rather than dangerous there were hun-
dreds of them they filled the clearing
though yvonne was only twenty yards
away she might have been a million miles
for all that was visible of her virginia
was lifted to her feet by what seemed
like a hundred hot wet greys and as
they led her still bound to where she
had last seen yvonne the whole thing
seemed more a practical joke than any
thing else

  then abruptly it stopped being a prac-
tical joke

  they had cut yvonnes suit like hers
leaving nothing but the hood over her
head fastened at the neck yvonne was
wearing a blouse and shorts and looked
like the heroine of a jungle picture when
venus

she saw virginia she med to get tip to go
to her

  but the greys stopped that by pinning
her to the ground with two knives through
her hands her shriek went through vir-
ginias head like a needle

  four of the greys held virginia so
that she had to watch what was going on
she shut her eyes but when yvonne
screamed again they had to come open

  if the greys had shouted and danced and
beat drums it would have been less hor-
rible but the only soimds were those f orced
from yvonne there were plenty of those

  to keep her sanity virginia concentrated
desperately on warren making his way
toward cefor he needed time suddenly
after a long spell of relaxation she flung
herself forward tore free and pitched be-
side yvonne who was still she realized
only mildly hurt beside what was to come

  warrens gone for help she mur-
mured hold out a little and hell be back

  as the greys dragged virginia to her
feet again yvonne screamed wildly why
do you leave her alone  why do you only
torture me i cant take any more she
can take it shes strong please leave me
alone please    aahhhh f

  she shrieked again as a grey bent over
her with a knife she wasnt screaming now
for nothing   

it was almost an hour later that
they brought warren in it had seemed
like days to virginia and probably untold
centuries to yvonne when she saw him
being forced into the clearing by a mass
of struggling greys virginia stared in hor-
ror she had always believed he would get
through the question had merely been
whether he would be in time he wouldnt
look at her he stared impassively at
yvonne instead

  they hadnt touched virginia yet beyond
holding her still-but it must be close to
her time if they werent going to let
yvonne die they couldnt do much more
to her there was very little blood the
greys had a herb that seemed to close the
skin though it left an angry purple dis-
coloration yvonne was almost all purple

mission	

for some time she had had no strength to
scream the greys were losing interest in
her further torture had no noticeable ef-
fect she was conscious but she didnt seem
to feel f resh cuts

  they must have had some invisible means
of communication among themselves sud-
denly as if at a signal they turned to vir-
ginia and with a sick feeling at her stom-
ach she knew her time had come

  i always wondered said warren cur-
iously what kind of figure you had

  but not being human the greys didnt
strip her they merely stretched her on
the ground and cut her bonds waiting for
her to make a dash for it that was part of
the fun

  suddenly warren tore himself free but
instead of running from the clearing he
threw himself at virginia play up he
panted they wont know what to do
theyll wait to see what happens it will
amuse them to see us fighting

  then you did get through 

  sure i got through i said i would
didnt i  but we have to give them some-
thing to think about so that they wont
sense the men closing in fight damn you
were not out of the wood yet if we give
them time to think   

  his breath left him in a gasp as virginias
hard fist sank into his stomach

  while the greys watched they fought
for their lives but not against each other
though that was part of it they didnt care
if they were hurt if the fight was too tame
to excite the greys they would be hurt
much more it meant nothing to the greys
that they were a man and a woman the
greys were monogeneous and had never
quite worked out the relationship of human
men and women

  virginias hood was torn and she won-
dered if the greys would stop the fight
from then on she was breathing poison
but it didnt matter she would either be
safe in six hours or as near dead as made
no difference she tore off the hood alto-
gether and threw it from her jerking her
hair back out of her eyes

  warren was grunting with pain more
than her blows deserved it did occur to
virginia once as he struck at her with feral
	planet

strength that perhaps he was hurting her
more than he need but then she realized
that as the greys sensed fear they prob-
ably sensed pain and that that was at the
root of their inhuman sadism after that
she didnt pull her punches either

  then warren his fist drawn back to jab
in her ribs swung at the nearest grey in-
stead knocked him spinning the clearing
was suddenly filled with men in tough plas-
tic suits they didnt use guns but long
knives it was massacre for the greys
knives couldnt pierce their suits

  it was massacre and virginia gladly
helped in it the moist black ground ran
with blood and none of it was red the
greys didnt run inflamed with bloodlust
they couldnt suddenly switch over to rea-
son and to fear they stood their ground
and were cut to pieces

       rell now you know the greys
   vv said warren

  they were in a room a civilized room in
a city again there were deep carpets on
the floor and soft couches and armchairs
virginia had thrown herself in one of them
still in her black suit her jacket was little
more than a collar there wasnt much left
of her slacks and warren was surveying

stories

her at last with satisfied curiosity and
smug satisfaction but she didnt care

  glamours husband was in cefor war-
ren murmured he came with the rescue
party poor devil shes still a fool but m
i know is she dead

  not yet i told her shed saved the rest
of us which was a lie and not much good
to her and her husband anyway but maybe
it was some comfort

  it wasnt a lie really she gave you an
hour virginia shuddered even though
if it hadnt been for her we wouldnt have
needed it why did you let them catch you 
to give the others time and maybe to
see how tough you were he felt his ribs
tenderly but this hero business has got
to stop the next time something like this
happens i really will let someone else take
the risk all of it not just some

  he grinned down at her swaying a little
on his feet

you first spoke to me about nine hours
ago and you spent a lot of that time hating
me do you think weve known each othes
long enough for you to kiss me 
nothing would make me get up
nothing you want another fight

  she rose hurriedly anything she said
but that

                

           you can explore the outermost reaches of the gal-
           axy the dark mysteries beyond time and space   
           you can feel the harsh tingle of danger as you set foot

here will be a great
many changes ned cynthia
jackson said she stared out the
viewport at the little green world which
the contact rocket star mist was swiftly
approaching on warp-drive

  her husband co-pilot nodded remem-
bering clifton and helen sweeney and the
-planet stories-july

 sweeney youngsters remembering with
 a smile tommy sweeneys kite-flying an-
 tics his freckles and mischievous eyes-
 a tow-headed kid of ten with an irish sense
 of humor sturdily planted in a field of
 alien corn five thousand light years from
 earth

 sowing and reaping and bringing in
 the sheaves in the blue light of a great


	planet

double sun his dreams as vibrant with
promise as the interstellar warp-drive
which a century ago had brought the
first prospect ship from earth to the stars

  hed be a man grown now as sturdy as
his dad you could almost take that for
granted and his sister would be a willowy
girl with clear blue eyes and shed come
out of a white plastic cottage with the
buoyancy of twenty summers in her car-
riage and smile

  theyd be formers still you couldnt
change the sweeneys in a million years
couldnt wean them away from the good
earth

  it was funny but he couldnt even visu-
alize the sweeneys without thinking of a
little sleepy town the kind of town hed
left himself as a kid to strike out across
the great curve of the universe dry dust
of kansas and the dakotas that would
still be blowing after a thousand years

  theyve  had time to build a town
ned cynthia said a really fine town
with broad streets and modem dust-
proof buildings

  ned jackson awoke from his reverie
with a wry start he nodded again re-
membering the mkny other colonists and
the equipment which had been shipped to
the little green world across the years
plastic materials to build houses and
schools and roadways educational ma-
terials to build eager young minds

  every ten years a contact rocket went
out from earth by interstellar warp-drive
to make a routine check the trip was a
long one-eight months-but the central
colonization bureau had to make sure that
anarchy did not take the place of law on
worlds where teeming jungles encouraged
the free exercise of mans best qualities-
and his worst

  from end to end of the galaxy on
large planets and small progress had to be
measured in terms of the greatest good
for the greatest number there could be
no other yardstick for when man ceased
to be a social animal his star-conquering
genius shriveled to the vanishing point

  the friends we made here were very
special ned cynthia said i guess peo-
ple who dare greatly have to be a bit
keener than the stay-at-homes a bit more

stories

eager and alive but the sweeneys had
such a tremendous zest for living-

  i know ned said

  they were wonderful-generous and
kind it will be good to see them again
good to- cynthia laughed i dont
know why but i was about to say good
to be home

  ned thought he knew why

  theyd made their first flight for the
bureau exactly ten years before it had
been a combined official business and
honeymoon flight and almost the whole
of it had been spent on the little green
world

  dad not the queen bee and her consort
flying high above the hive on a night of
perfumed darkness remember best what
was bliss to recall the shifting lights and
shadows and honey-scented murmurings
of their nuptial trance

  would not the brightest furthest stat
jbe home to the star-beguiled

the rocket ship was out of
subspace now and traveling on its
murmuring overdrive it was well within
sight of green valleys and purple-rimmed
hills

  the planet had grown from a tiny dot
to a shining silver sphere swimming in
misty radiance for a moment it had wav-
ered against the brightly burning stars
caught in a web of darkness-

  then swiftly had exploded into a close
familiar world as beautiful as a flower
opening snowy petals to the dawn

  it was a simple matter to bring the
rocket down the valley seemed to sweep
up toward them and gravity jets took over
in automatic sequence there was a gentle
hiss of air as the star mist settled to rest
on hard-packed soil a scant fifty yards
from a blue and vermillion flower garden

  through a dancing blue haze a dwelling
loomed white and serene in the rosy flush
of evening

  cynthia looked at her husband her eyes
wide with surmise

  just shows how close you can come
when you follow dial readings ned said
the first lean-to shack stood just about
here i remember the slope of the soil-

  cynthias eyes grew warm and eager
the timeless ones	

ned im glad-its no fun searching for
old friends with your heart in your
throat well step right up and surprise
them

  when they emerged from the ship the
perfume of flowers mingled with the rich-
er scent of freshly-turned earth bringing
back memories of their earlier visit

  there had been no flower garden then
but the soil had possessed the same april
shower freshness

  i must look like a fright cynthia
said you didnt give me time to powder
my nose

  they were within five yards of the
dwelling when a door opened and a child
of ten or twelve emerged she was blue-
eyed golden-haired and she stood for a
moment blinking in the evening light her
hair whipped by the wind

  mary sweeney cynthia exclaimed
catching hold of neds arm then in a
stunned whisper oh but it cant be
shed be a grown woman

the child straightened at the sound
of the voice looking about she saw
ned and cynthia and blank amazement
came into her eyes then she gave a little
glad cry and ran toward them her arms
reaching out in welcome

  youve come back she exclaimed
mom and dad thought it would be a long
time but i knew youd come soon i
knew i was sure

  nowhere any sign that this was not the
child they had known ten years before
her voice the peaches-and-cream color
that flooded her cheeks the way her hair
clung in little ringlets to her temples all
struck memory chords from long ago

  and now she was beckoning them into
the dwelling having moved a little away
from them she was balancing herself in
elfin lightness on one toe and smiling in
warm gratefulness the sun all blue and
gold behind her

  she had always seemed an elfin and
mischievous child

  what can it mean ned
  white-lipped ned shook his head i-

i dont know wed better go inside
helen sweeney her white-streaked au-
burn hair damp with steam vapor sent a

frying pan crashing to the floor as she
turned from the stove with a startled cry

  ned cynthia why land sakes it
seems only yesterday-

  ned ha a good look at her face the
eyes were the same good-humored and
kindly and wise and if she had been
forty a decade before she seemed now to
be forcing herself back into an earlier in-
stant of time-the very evening of that
last well-remembered birthday party with
the candles all bright and gleaming and
the children refusing to admit that she
could ever be middle-aged

  old clifton came in from his workshop
out in back hed been whittling away at
a rocketship model and he still held it
firmly in the crook of his arm his eyes
puckered in dust bowl grief like most
men of the soil clifton had difficulty with
his whittling when he turned his skill to
rocketships

  the grief vanished when he saw ned
and cynthia pure relight took hold of
him bringing a quick smile of welcome to
his lips

  back so soon seems only yesterday
you folks went away

  it was ten years ago ned said his
throat strangely dry

  clifton looked at him and shook his
head ten years ned  surely youre jok-
ing 

  it was a good many years clifton
helen sweeney said quickly you must
forgive us ned cynthia time just
doesnt seem to matter when youre busy
building for the future time goes fast
like a great ship at sea its sails ballooning
out with a wind that keeps carrying it
faster and faster into the sunrise

   there are no ships here clifton said
chuckling helens fancy-wedded to
earth but shes forgetting the last sail-
ing ship rotted away a hundred years be-
fore she was born its a good thought
though

  dont know what put a sailing ship in
helens head but i guess folks who were
born on earth have a right to hark back
a bit itll be different with tom and
mary

  wheres tommy ned asked

  out shucking com cliftons voice
	planet

was vibrant with sudden pride hes still
the same reckless young lad hed risk
his neck to bring in a full harvest i keep
warning him but he goes right on worry-
ing his mother

  fact is he hasnt changed at all no
more than we have

  so they knew cynthia looked at ned
an unspoken question in her eyes how
could they accept the tremendousness of
not changing without realizing that any ar-
rest of the aging process must alter their
daily lives in a thousand intangible ways

  how could they build for the future-
when their children would never grow up 

  it was ned who discovered the mind
block

  not only had the sweeneys ceased to
age physically-they lacked a normal time
sense if you reminded them of the passing
years their minds cleared momentarily and
they could think back

  but that link with the past had no stay-
ing power it was like punching pillows to
get them to remember they lived in the
present well content to accept the world
about them on a day-to-day basis warmed
by the bright flame of their children grow-
ing up-

  but their children werent growing up
-they had only the illusion of change the
illusion of planning for their future and
that illusion was terribly real to them-
unless jolted by a question

 hows tommy

  why tommy hasnt changed at all-

  a puzzled frown a moments honest
facing of the truth an old memory stirr-
ing into life then the mind block closing
in clamping down

  ned cynthia youll stay for dinner

it was late and growing cold and
the stars had appeared in the sky in
the rocket ship ned sat facing his wife

  that house was never built by human
hands he said a cold prickling at the
base of his scalp he had suffered from
the prickling off and on for a full hour
he could still taste the strong coffee hed
downed at a gulp before rising in haste at
the end of an uneasy meal

  he was sorry now theyd returned to
the ship without waiting to say hello to

stories

tommy fresh from his harvesting chores
tommy was the brightest member of the
family perhaps tommy knew more than
the others-or could remember better

  not built by human hands but thats
insane ned cynthias face shadowed
from below by the cold light of the instru-
ment board was harsh with concern the
materials came from earth

they did ned acknowledged grade
a plastics-the best and a good engineer
can build almost anything with malleable
plastics but not a house without seams 
without-seams 

  joints connections little rough places
ned elaborated inside and out that house
was smooth all of a piece like a burst
of frozen energy like-oh you know
what i mean surely you must have notic-
ed it

  there were other colonists cynthia
said some of them were engineers
theyve had time to work out new con-
structive techniques

  theyve had time to disappear why
did the sweeneys act so funny when i
asked them about the other colonists  why
did clifton refuse to look at me why did
i have to drag the answer out of him oh
we spread out enough land here for all of
us- does that ring true to you

  they didnt want us to stay together
tommy sweeney said

  ned leapt up with a startled cry cyn-
thia swayed her eyes widening in stark
disbelief

  tommy sweeney walked smiling into
the compartment his shoulders squared
he came through the pilot-room wall in
a blaze of light and stood between ned
and helen his lips quivering in boyish
earnestness

  take any school tommy said some
of the pupils are bright some are just
good students who work hard at their
homework some are stupid and dull if
you let them stay together the bright ones
the really bright ones get held back
tommy seemed suddenly to realize he
was seeing ned and cynthia for the first
time in ten years his good friends ned
and cynthia a cynthia who was as beauti-
ful as ever though deathly pale now and
a ned who was just a little older and
the timeless ones	

grayer

  a broad grin overspread his face 
knew youd come back he said

  you--you came through a solid metal
wall ned said feeling as though an
earthquake had taken place inside of him

  its easy when you know how tom-
my said

  who taught you how cynthia asked
in a voice so emotional ned forgot his
own horror in concern for her sanity
who taught you tommy

  the green people tommy said
  the green-people

  they live in the forest tommy said
they come out at night and dance around
the house they hold hands and dance and
sing then they talk to us to mom dad
and sis-but mostly to me they taught
me how to play to really have fun
did they teach you how to change the
atoms of your body so that you could
pass through a solid metal wall ned
aslced framing the question very care-
fully

  shucks it was nothing like that tom-
my said they just told me that if i
forgot about walls i could go anywhere
and you believed them

  suddenly cynthia was laughing her
laughter rang out wild and uncontrollable
in the pilot-room

  he believed them ned he believed
them

  ned went up to her and took her by the
shoulders and shook her

  tommy looked shamefaced he shuf-
fled his feet ill at ease in the presence of
adult hysteria

  ive got to go now he stammered
mom will be awful mad if im late for
dinner again

  you are late tommy cynthia said
the jokes on you we just had dinner
with your parents in a house ned claims
wasnt built by human hands

  she laughed wildly your parents are
sensible people though they didnt even
try to walk through the kitchen wall
they could if they tried hard enough
tommy said someday they will
tommy looked almost apologetic i
cant stay any longer i saw your ship
and wanted to see if you really had come

back i thought it might be someone else
im sure glad its you

  tommy turned abruptly and walked
straight out of the pilot-room his small
body lighting up the wail until he vanished

cynthia stared at her husband
her eyes dark with a questioning
horror

  the green people ned said think
cynthia does the name mean anything to
you 	

  cynthia shook her head her lips shaping
a soundless no

  ned sat down slowly rubbing his jaw
i just thought you might know some-
thing about druidism and what the
strange rites of that mysterious cult meant
to the ancient inhabitants of gaul and the
british isles according to the roman
historian pliny the druids built stone
houses for their pupils and called them-
selves the green people

  starlight from the viewport illuminated
neds pale face he paused then said
the druids were soothsayers and sorcer-
ers who disappeared from history at the
time of the roman conquest it was
widely believed they had the power of
conferring eternal youth they taught that
time was an illusion space the shadow of
a dream

  his eyes were grim with speculation
the druids were teachers almost in the
modem sense pliny records that they had
a passion for teaching and thought of
their worshippers as pupils as children
with much to learn instruction in physical
science formed the cornerstone of the
druidic cult

  cynthia leaned forward her face strain-
ed and intense as he went on

  the romans hated and feared them
there was a terrible bloody battle and the
druids no longer danced in their groves of
oak in slow procession to a weird dirge-
like chanting they vanished from earth
and almost from the memory of man
ned took a deep breath

  man fears the unknown and knowl-
edge is a source of clanger maybe the
druids were never really native to earth
what if this were their home planet-
ned you cant really believe-
	planet

   listen ned said

  the sound was clearly audible through
the thin walls of the rocket ship it was
a steady dull droning-an eerie terrifying
sound

  ned got up and walked to the viewport
he stared out-

  he could see the sweeneys dwelling
clearly it was bathed in an unearthly green
light and around it in a circle robed
figures moved through shadows the color
of blood around and around in ever wid-
ening circles their tall gaunt bodies
strangely bent

  for a full minute -he stared out when
his wife joined him he stretched out a
hand and let it rest lightly on her shoulder

  perhaps we wouldnt be far wrong
if we thought of the sweeneys as cata-
lysts he said

  cynthia stood very straight and quiet
a great fear growing in her

   catalysts ned 

   its just a wild guess of course i cant
even tell you what made me think of it
but it does have a certain relevancy in
chemistry as you know a catalytic agent
is a substance which promotes chcmical
action but is in itself unchanged

 well	 

  why do men and women who surrend-
er themselves to sorcery remain in legend
eternally young young unchanging its
a belief as old as prehistory and all the
ages since only in the middle ages were
witches pictured as shrunken hideous old
women the ancient world pictured witches
as eternally youthful unaging

  a long pause and then ned said as
unaging as the forests of oak where they
served as human catalysts for the druids
before the druids left earth forever

   he suddenly seemed to be thinking aloud
rather than addressing his wife

  well-and why not the druids must
change for change is the first law of life
but perhaps they can only find complete
fulfillment can only grow in wisdom and
strength by using human beings as little
hard grains of chemical substance which
must remain forever bright and shining

  human catalysts imprisoned in a hor-
rible little test tube of a house if human
beings aged and changed they would cease

stories

to be catalysts they would become value-
less to the druids and when the romans
discovered the truth-

  agreement was clearly in cynthias eyes
she moved closer to the viewport her
face pale

  fear and a merciless hatred ned
said pursuing the druids driving them
from earth and dim fearful legends re-
maining of a dark magic older than the
human race

  ned theyve stopped dancing cyn-
thias voice rang out sharply in the silence
theyre coming toward the ship

  i know ned said

  but we dont know what theyre plan-
ning to do cynthias voice rose weve
got to get out

  steady ned said turning if we
take off at peak acceleration i just cant
picture them stopping us

ccvted the sweeneys may be happier
 than we know cynthia said
hours later they were deep in subspace
a hundred light years from the little green
world and in the warm security of the
pilot-room its menacing shadows seemed
immeasurably remote

  happy ned laughed harshly kids
wholl never grow up adults cut off from
all further growth the same today to-
morrow and forever

  their minds may change cynthia
said their minds may grow ned tommy
said that bright pupils could go far

  as catalysts caught in a ghastly trap
how can you be so sure ned a wild
guess you called it how do you know the
druids and the sweeneys dont learn from
one another perhaps they grow wise to-
gether in a wonderful bright sharing o
knowledge and happiness thats like noth-
ing we can imagine

  ned looked at his wife why say a
thing like that why even think of it
pandora i guess

  what do you mean

  im a woman and the pandora complex
is pretty basic darling id be tempted to
go back and throw open the box

  something pretty black and horrible
would come out ned said sharply you
can take my word for that i hope youre
the timeless ones	

not forgetting that pandora was the first
woman chosen by zeus to bring complete
ruin on the human race

  she didnt quite succeed and how can
we know for sure ned if what you say
is true if the druids were really driven
from earth we havent done so well
since wars and madness for two thousand
years destruction and cruelty and death
all you have to do is prove wed be
better off if the druids had stayed ned
said

  darling think if people grew wiser
all the time if they never aged would
they want to murder one another

  now see here-

  cynthia smiled think of having our
own beautiful little home forever in a
fragrant woody patch with shining kitch-
en utensils on the wall think of being
spared all the miseries of old age and
poverty and sickness and death

  think of having neighbors like the
sweeneys to grow young with to grow
wise and young with day by splendid day
until the end of time

  there was a long silence and then cyn-
thia said id trust them ned the
druids i mean id take the chance what
have we to lose thats really great that
can hold a candle to what the sweeneys
have 

  you can go anywhere if you just re-
member how close you are to where you
want to be  tommy sweeney said coming

through the pilot room wall in a blaze of
light he grinned i asked mom and dad
to try real hard this time and here they
are

  all of the sweeneys came into the
pilot room as tommy spoke their faces
incredibly radiant

  i never really believed tommy until
this minute clifton sweeney said if
you just forget about walls youre where
you want to be

  sure you are tommy said its as
easy as skinning a chipmunk

  ned cynthia helen sweeney said
come back

  tommys sister simply smiled a mis-
chievous elfin smile which seemed to mock
the vast loneliness of space it was as if
some wizard game played by laughing chil-
dren and wise forest creatures through
long golden afternoons had become a uni-
verse-spanning web embracing everything
in its path in a warm and radiant way
cynthia looked at dan well darling
yes ned said with quick decision
well go back

  and at that moment in the forest deep
and dark the druids built another house
it was designed to appeal to a man and
a woman who had traveled far and grown
weary of human cruelty and death it was
designed for gracious living but whether
the druids in their inscrutable wisdom
wished mankind well or llf who could say
temple of han

a short story by jack vance

          to steal the shimmering eye of han-
          that was no trick for the wily terra
          	to hand back the great green jewel
          to give his body to priestly torture-
          that was asking much of a space-rogue

in the nip-and-tuck busi-
ness of keeping himself alive briar
kelly had not yet been able to shed his
disguise the adventure had turned out
rather more ruggedly than it had started
he had not bargained for so much hell

  up to the moment he had entered the
queer dark temple at north city the
disguise had served him well he had
been one with the hans no one had look-
ed at him twice then once inside the
temple he was alone and disguise was
unnecessary

  it was an oddly impressive place a
gothic web of trusses supported the ceiling
alcoves along the walls were crammed
with bric-a-brac red and green lamps cast
an illumination which was stifled and ab-
sorbed by black drapes

  walking slowly down the central nave
every nerve tingling kelly had approach-
ed the tall black mirror at the far end
watching his looming reflection with hyp-
notic fascination there were limpid depths
beyond and kelly would have looked more
closely had he not seen the jewel

  it was a ball of cool green fire resting
on a black velvet cushion with marvelling
fingers kelly had lifted it turned it over
and over-and then tumult had broken
loose the red and green lights flickered
an alarm horn brayed like a crazy bull
vengeful priests appeared in the alcoves
as if by magic and the disguise had be-
come a liability the tubular black cloak
constricted his legs as he ran-back along
the aisle down the shabby steps through


  the foul back alleys to his air-boat now
as he crouched low over the controls
sweat beaded up under the white grease-
paint and his skin itched and crawled

  ten feet below the salt-crusted mud-
flats fleeted astern dirty yellow rushes
whipped the hull pressing an elbow to
his hip kelly felt the hard shape of the
jewel the sensation aroused mixed feel-
ings apprehension predominating he
dropped the boat even closer to the ground
five minutes of this ill be out of radar
range thought kelly back at bucktown
im just one among fifty thousand they
cant very well locate me unless herli
talks or mapes   

  he hazarded a glance at the rear-vision
plate north city could still be seen an
exaggerated mont st michel jutting up
from the dreary salt-marsh misty ex-
halations blurred the detail it faded intc
the sky finally dropped below the horizon
kelly eased up the nose of the boat rose
tangentially from the surface aiming into
magra taratempos the hot white sun

  the atmosphere thinned the sky deep-
ened to black stars came out there was
old sol a yellow star hanging between
sadal suud and sadal melik in aquarius
-only thirty light years to home-

  kelly heard a faint swishing sound-
the light changed white to red he blink-
ed looked around in bewilderment

  magra taratempos had disappeared
low to the left a giant red sun hulked
above the horizon below the salt marshes
swam in a new claret light
one of the towering shadows shrunk condensed swirled to a man-like shape
	planet

  in amazement kelly gazed from red
sun to planet back up across the heavens
where magra taratempos had hung only
a moment before

  ive gone crazy said kelly un-
less   

two or three months before
a peculiar rumor had circulated buck-
town for lack of better entertainment
the sophisticates of the city had made a
joke of the story until it finally grew
stale and was no more heard

  kelly who worked as computer switch-
man at the astrogation station was well-
acquainted with the rumor it went to the
effect that a han priest dour and in-
tense under his black cloak had been trip-
ped into the marsh by a drunken pollen-
collector like a turtle the priest had
shoved his white face out from under the
hood of his cloak and rasped in the pid-
gin of the cplanet you abuse the priest
of han you mock us and the name of
the great god time is short the
seventh year is at hand and you godless
earth-things will seek to flee but there
will be nowhere for you to go

  such had been the tale kelly remember-
ed the pleased excitement which had flut-
tered from tongue to tongue he grimaced
examined the sky in new apprehension

  the facts were before his eyes un-
deniable magra taratempos had vanished
in a different quarter of the sky a new
sun had appeared

  careless of radar tracing he nosed up
and broke entirely clear of the atmosphere
the stellar patterns had changed black-
ness curtained half the sky with here and
there a lone spark of a star or the wisp
of a far galaxy to the other quarter a
vast blot of light stretched across the sky
a narrow elongated luminosity with a cen-
tral swelling the whole peppered with a
million tiny points of light

  kelly cut the power from his engine
the air-boat drifted unquestionably the
luminous blot was a galaxy seen from one
of its outer fringes in ever-growing be-
wilderment kelly looked back at the planet
below to the south he could see the
triangular plateau shouldering up from
the swamp and lake lenore near buck-

stories

town below was the salt marsh and far
to the north the rugged pile where the
hans had their city

  lets face it said kelly unless im
out of my mind-and i dont think i am
-the entire planet has been picked up and
taken to a new sun    ive heard of
strange things here and there but this is
it   

  he felt the weight of the jewel in his
pocket and with it a new thrill of ap-
prehension to the best of his knowledge
the han priests could not identify him
at bucktown it had been herli and mapes
who had urged him into the escapade but
they would hold their tongues ostensibly
he had flown to his cabin along the lake-
shore and there was no one to know of
his comings and goings    he turned the
boat down toward bucktown and a half
hour later landed at his cabin beside lake
lenore he had scraped the grease-paint
from his face the cloak he had jettisoned
over the swamp and the jewel weighed
heavy in his pocket

  the cabin a low flat-roofed building
with aluminum walls and a glass front
appeared strange and unfamiliar in the
new light kelly walked warily to the door
he looked right and left no one nothing
was visible he put his ear to the panel
of the door no sound

  he slid back the panel stepped inside
swept the interior with a swift glance
everything appeared as he had left it

  he started toward the visiphone then
halted

  the jewel

  he took it from his pocket examined it
for the first time it was a sphere the size
of a golf-ball the center shone with a
green fire decreasing toward the outer sur-
face he hefted it it was unnaturally
heavy strangely fascinating altogether
lovely think of it around the neck of
lynette mason   

  not now kelly wrapped it in paper
tucked it into an empty pint jar behind
the cabin an old shag-bark slanted up out
of the black humus and overhung the roof
like a gray and tattered beach-umbrella
kelly dug a hole under one of the arched
roots buried the jewel

  returning to the cabin he walked to i
temple

the visiphone reached out to call the sta-
tion while his hand was yet a foot from
the buttons the buzzer sounded    kelly
drew his hand back

  better not to answer

  the buzzer sounded again-again kelly
stood holding his breath looking at the
blank face of the screen

  silence

  he washed the last of the grease-paint
from his face changed his clothes ran
outside jumped into his air-boat and took
off for bucktown

he landed on the roof of the sta-
tion noting that herlis car was
parked in its wonted slot suddenly he
felt less puzzled and forlorn the station
with its machinery and solid earth-style
regulations projected reassurance a sense
of normality somehow the ingenuity and
aggressive attack which had taken men to
the stars would solve the present enigma

  or would it ingenuity could take men
through space but ingenuity would find
itself strained locating a speck of a planet
a hundred thousand light-years in an un-
known direction and kelly still had his
own problem the jewel into his minds-
eye came a picture the cabin by the lake
the dilapidated gray parasol of the shag-
bark and glowing under the root the
green eye of the sacred jewel in the vision
he saw the black-robed figure of a han
priest moving across the open space be-
fore the cabin and he saw the flash of the
dough-white face   

  kelly turned a troubled glance up at
the big red sun entered the station

  the administration section was vacant
kelly climbed the stair to the operation
department

  he stopped in the doorway surveyed
the room it covered the entire square of
the upper floor work-benches made a
circuit of the room with windows above
a polished cylinder the cosmoscope came
down through the ceiling and below was
the screen to catch the projection

  four men stood by the star-index run-
ning a tape herli glanced up briefly
turned back to the clicking mechanism

  strange herli should have been interest-
ed should at least have said hello

of han	

  kelly self-consciously crossed the room
he cleared his throat well-i made it
im back

  so i see said herli

  kelly fell silent he glanced up through
the window at the red sun what do you
make of it

  not the least idea were running the
star-tapes on the off chance its been regis-
tered-a last-gasp kind of hope

  there was more silence they had been
talking before he had entered the room
kelly sensed this from their posture

  at last mapes said with a forced casual-
ness seen the news

  no said kelly no i havent
there was more in mapes voice some-
thing more personal than the shift of the
planet after a moments hesitation he
went to the visiphone pushed the code for
news

  the screen lit showed a view of the
swamp kelly leaned forward buried up
to their necks were a dozen boys and girls
from the bucktown high-school crawling
eagerly over them were the small three-
legged salt-crabs others popped up out of
the slime or tunnelled under toward the
squirming bodies

  kelly could not stand the screams he
reached forward-

  herli said sharply leave it on-
harder than kelly had ever heard him
speak the announcement is due pretty
soon

  the announcement came in the rasping
toneless pidgin of the han priests

  among the outsiders is a wicked thief
he has despoiled us of the seven-year
eye let him come forward for his due
until the thief has brought the seven-
year eye in his own hand to the sacred
temple of han every hour one of the
outsiders will be buried in the crab-war-
ren if the thief hangs back all will be
so dealt with and there will be an end to
the earth-things

  mapes said in a tight voice did you
take their seven-year eye

  kelly nodded numbly yes

  herli made a -sharp sound in his throat
turned away

  kelly said miserably i dont know
what came over me there it was-glow-
	planet

ing like a little green moon  i took it
herli said gutturally dont just stand
there

  kelly reached out to the visiphone push-
ed buttons the screen changed a han
pries stared forth into kellys face

  kelly said i stole your jewel   dont
kill any more people ill bring it back to
you

  the priest said every hour until you
arrive one of the earth-things dies a
wicked death

  kelly leaned forward slammed off the
screen with a sudden furious sweep of his
hand he turned in anger

  dont stand there glaring at me you
herli you told me i wouldnt even make
it into the temple and if any of you guys
had been where i was and saw that jewel
like i saw it youd have taken it too
mapes growled under his breath herlis
shoulders seemed to sag he looked away
maybe youre right briar

 kelly said are we helpless why
didnt we fight when they took those twelve
kids theres maybe a million hans but
theres fifty thousand of us-and they
have no weapons that i know of

  theyve seized the power station said
herli without power we cant distill
water we cant radiate our hydroponics
were in a cleft stick

kelly turned away so long fellows
no one answered him he walked down
the stairs across the parking strip to his
air-car he was conscious of their eyes
looking down from the window

  in up away first to his cabin by the
lake under the shag-bark for the seven-
year eye then the arc over the planet
south to north then the gray fortress of
north settlement and the dark temple
in the center

kelly dropped the air-car directly in
front of the temple no reason now
for stealth

  he climbed to the ground looked about
through the strange purple twilight which
had come to the ramshackle city a few
hans moved past and kelly saw the flash
of their faces

  he walked slowly up the steps to the
temple paused indecisively in the door-

stories

way there was no point in adding further
provocation to his offenses no doubt they
planned to kill him he might as well make
it as easy as possible 

   hello he called into the dark interior
in a voice he tried to keep firm any
priests in there ive brought back the
jewel  

  there was no response listening in-
tently he could hear a distant murmur
he took a few steps into the temple peer-
ed up the nave the muffled red and
green illumination confused rather than
aided his vision he noticed a curious ir-
regularity to the floor he took a step
forward-another-another-he stepped on
something soft there was the flash of
white below him the floor was covered
by the black-robed priests lying flat on
their faces

  the priest he had trod on made no
sound kelly hesitated time was passing
 he crammed all his doubts fears
vacillations into a corner of his mind
strode forward careless of where he step-
ped

  down the center of the nave he walked
holding the green jewel in his hand ahead
he saw the sheen of the tall black mirror
and there on the black cushion was a
second jewel identical to the one he car-
ried a han priest stood like a ghost in
a black robe he watched kelly approach
without movement kelly laid the jewel on
the cushion beside its twin

  there it is ive brought it back im
sorry i took it i-well i acted on a wild
impulse

  the priest picked up the jewel held it
under his chin as if feeling the warmth
from the green fire

  your impulse has cost fifteen earth
lives

  fifteen faltered kelly there were
but twelve-

  two hours delay has sent two to the
crab warren said the han and your-
self fifteen

  kelly said with a shaky bravado
youre taking a lot on yourself-these
murders-

  i am not acquainted with your idiom
said the priest but it seems as if you
convey a foolish note of menace what can
teiffpjle of han

you few earth-things do against great god
han wjjp has just now taken our planet
across the galaxy

  kelly said stupidly your god han-
moved the planet

  certainly he has taken us far and
forever distant from earth to this mellow
sun such is his gratitude for our prayers
and for the tribute of the eye

  kelly said with studied carelessness
you have your jewel back i dont see
why youre so indignant-

  the priest said look here kelly fol-
lowed his gesture saw a square black hole
edged with a coping of polished stone
this shaft is eighteen miles deep every
priest of han descends to the bottom once
a week and carries back to the surface a
basket of crystallized stellite on rare oc-
casions the matrix of the eye is found
and then there is gratification in the city
  such a jewel did you steal

  kelly took his eyes away from the
shaft eighteen miles  i naturally
wasnt aware of the-

  no matter the deed is done and now
the planet has been moved and earth
power is unable to prevent such punish-
ments as we wish to visit upon you

  kelly tried to keep his voice firm
punish what do you mean

  behind him he heard a rustling the
shuffle of movement he looked over his
shoulder the black cloaks merged with
the drapes of the temple and the han
faces floated in mid-air

  you will be killed said the priest
kelly stared into the white face if the
manner of your going is of any interest
to you- the priest conveyed details
which froze kellys flesh clabbered the
moisture in his mouth your death will
thereby deter other earth-things from like
crimes

  kelly protested in spite of himself you
have your jewel there it is    if you
insist on killing me-kill me but-
strange said the han priest you
earth-things fear pain more than any-
thing else you can conceive this fear is
your deadliest enemy we hans now we
fear nothing- he looked up at the tall
black mirror bowed slightly -nothing
but our great god han



  kelly stared at the shimmering black
surface whats that mirror to do with
your god han

  that is no mirror that is the portal
to the place of the gods and every seven
years a priest goes through to convey the
eye to han

  kelly tried to plumb the dark depths of
the mirror what lies beyond what kind
of land

  the priest made no answer

  kelly laughed in a shrill voice he did
not recognize he lurched forward threw
up his fist in a blow which carried every
ounce of his strength and weight he
struck the priest at a point where a mans
jaw would be felt a brittle crunch the
priest spun around fell in the tangle of
his cloak

  kelly turned on the priests in the nave
and they sighed in fury kelly was desper-
ate fearless now he laughed again reach-
ed down scooped both jewels from the
cushion great god han lives behind the
mirror and moves planets for jewels i
have two jewels maybe han will move a
planet for me   

  he jumped close to the black mirror
he put out his hand and felt a soft sur-
face like a curtain of air he paused in
sudden trepidation beyond was the un-
known   

  pushing at him came the first rank of
the han priests here was the known

  kelly could not delay death was death
if he died passing through the black cur-
tain if he suffocated in airless space-it
was clean fast death

  he leaned forward closed his eyes held
his breath stepped through the curtain

kelly had come a tremendous dis-
tance it was a distance not to be
reckoned in miles or hours but in quanti-
ties like abstract irrational ideas

  he opened his eyes they functioned
he could see he was not dead    or
was he     he took a step forward sens-
ed solidity under his feet he looked down
saw a glassy black floor where small
sparks burst flickered died constella-
tions universes or merely-sparks

  he took another step it might have been
a yard a mile a light-year he moved with
	planet

the floating ease of a man walking in a
dream

  he stood on the lip of an amphitheater
a bowl like a lunar crater he took another
step he stood in the center of the bowl
he halted fought to convince himself of
his consciousness blood made a rushing
sound as it flowed through his veins he
swayed might have fallen if gravity had
existed to pull him down but there was
no gravity his feet clung to the surface
by some mysterious adhesion beyond his
experience the blood-sound rose and fell
in his ears blood meant life he was alive

  he looked in back of him and in the
blurring of his eyes could not distinguish
what he saw he turned took a step for-
ward-

  he was intruding he felt the sudden
irritated attention of gigantic personalities

  he gazed about the glassy floor and
the faintest of watery gray lights seeping
down from above collected in the con-
cavity where he stood space was vast in-
terminable without perspective

  kelly saw the beings he had disturbed-
felt rather than saw them a dozen giant
shapes looming above

  one of these shapes formed a thought
and a surge of meanings permeated space
impinged on kellys mind willy-nilly tran-
slating itself into words

  what is this thing from whose world
did it come

  from mine this must be han kel-
ly looked from shape to shape to deter-
mine which the god might be

  remove it quickly- and to kellys
mind came a jumble of impressions he had
no words to express we must deal with
the matter of   again a quick listing
of ideas which refused to translate in
kellys mind he felt hans attention fo-
cussing on him he stood transfixed wait- 
ing for the obliteration he knew to be
imminent

  but he held the jewels and their green
glow shone up through his fingers he
cried out wait i came here for a pur-
pose i want a planet put back where it
belongs and i have jewels to pay-

  he felt the baleful pressure of hans
will on his mind-increasing increasing
he groaned in helpless anguish

stories

  wait came a calm thought transcen-
dency clear and serene

  i must destroy it han protested it
is the enemy of my jewel-senders

wait came from yet another of the
shades and kelly caught a nuance of an-
tagonism to han we must act judicially
why are you here came the query
of the leader

  kelly said the han priests are mur-
dering people of my race ever since the
planet we live on was moved its not
right

  ah came a thought like an exclama-
tion from the antagonist hans jewel-
senders do evil and unnatural deeds

  a minor matter a minor matter
came the restless thought of still another
shape han must protect his jewel-send-
ers

  and kelly caught the implication that
the jewel-sending was of cardinal import-
ance that the jewels were vital to the
gods

  the antagonist chose to make an issue
of the matter the condition of injustice
which han has effected must be abated
the leader meditated and now came
a sly thought to kelly which he sensed
had been channelled to his mind alone it
came from the antagonist challenge
han to a    the thought could only be
translated as duel i will aid you re-
lax your mind kelly grasping at any
straw loosened his mental fibers and felt
something like a damp shadow entering
his brain absorbing recording    all
in an instant the contact vanished

kelly felt the leaders mind waver-
ing over in favor of han he said
hurriedly improvising as best he could
leader in one of the legends of earth a
man journeyed to the land of the giants
as they came to kill him he challenged the
foremost to a duel with his life at stake
of three trials came a thought of
three trials added kelly in the story
the man won and was pennitted to return
to his native land after this fashion let
me duel in three trials with han

  the surge of thoughts thickened the
air-rancorous contempt from han sly
encouragement from the antagonist
temple

amusement from the leader

  you invoke a barbaric principle said
the leader but by a simple yet rigorous
logic it is a just device and shall be hon-
ored you shall duel han in three trials
why waste time inquired han i
can powder him to less than the atoms of
atoms

  no said the leader the trial may
not be on a basis of sheer potential you
and this man are at odds over an issue
which has no fundamental right or wrong
it is the welfare of his people opposed to
the welfare of your jewel-senders since
the issues are equal there would be no
justice in an unequal duel the trial must
be on a basis which will not unwontedly
handicap either party

  let a problem be stated suggested
the antagonist he who first arrives at
a solution wins the trial

  han was scornfully silent so the lead-
er formulated a problem--a terrific state-
ment whose terms were dimensions and
quasi-time and a dozen concepts which
kellys brain could in no wise grasp but
the antagonist intervened

  that is hardly a fair problem lying as
it does entirely out of the mans experience
let me formulate a problem and he
stated a situation which at first startled
kelly and then brought him hope

  the problem was one he had met a
year previously at the station a system
to integrate twenty-five different comuni-
cation bands into one channel was under
consideration and it was necessary to
thrust a beam of protons past a bank of
twenty-five mutually inter-acting magnets
and hit a pin-point filter at the far end of
the case the solution was simple enough
-a statement of the initial vector in terms
of a coordinate equation and a voltage po-
tential-yet the solution had occupied the
station calculator for two months kelly
knew this solution as he knew his own
name

  hurry came the antagonists secret
thought

  kelly blurted out the answer

  there was a wave of astonishment
through the group and he felt their sus-
picious inspection

you are quick indeed said the lead-

f han	

er non-plussed

  another problem called the antago-
nist once more he brought a question
from kellys experience this concerning
the behavior of positrons in the secondary
layer of a star in a cluster of six all at
specified temperatures and masses and
this time kellys mind worked faster he
immediately stated the answer still he an-
ticipated han by mere seconds

  han protested how could this small
pink brain move faster than my cosmic
consciousness 

  how is this  asked the leader how
do you calculate so swiftly

   kelly fumbled for ideas finally strung
together a lame statement i do not cal-
culate in my brain is a mass of cells
whose molecules form themselves into
models of the problems they move in an
instant the problem is solved and the
solution comes to me

   anxiously he waited but the reply seem-
ed to satisfy the group these creatures-
or gods if such they were-were they so
naive only the antagonist suggested
complex motives han kelly sensed was
old of great force of a hard and inflexible
nature the leader was venerable beyond
thought calm and untroubled as space it-
self

  what now came from the antago-
nist shall there be another problem or
shall the man be declared the victor
kelly would have been well pleased to
let well enough alone but this evidently
did not suit the purposes of the antago-
nist hence his quiet jeer

  no the thoughts of han roared
forth almost like sound because of a
ridiculous freak in this creatures brain
must i admit him my superior i can
fling him through a thousand dimensions
with a thought snap him out of existence
out of memory-

  perhaps because you are a god came
the antagonists taunt and of pure-
another confusing concept a mixture of
energy divinity force intelligence the
man is but a combination of atoms and
moves through the oxidation of carbon and
hydrogen perhaps if you were as he he
might face you hand to hand and defeat
you

stories

  a curious tenseness stiffened the mental
atmosphere hans thoughts came sluggish-
ly tinged for the first time with doubt

  let that be the third trial said the
leader composedly han gave a mental
shrug one of the towering shadows
shrunk condensed swirled to a man-like
shape solidified further at last stood fac-
ing kelly a thing like a man glowing
with a green phosphorescence like the
heart of the seven-year eye

 the antagonists secret thought came
to kelly seize the jewel at the back of
the neck

kelly scanned the slowly advancing
figure it was exactly his height and
heft naked but radiating an inhuman
confidence the face was blurred fuzzy
and kelly could never afterward describe
the countenance he tore his gaze away

  how do we fight  he demanded beads
of sweat dripping from his body do we
set any rules-or no holds barred

  tooth and nail came the calm
thoughts of the leader han now has
organic sensibilities like yours if you kill
this body or render it unconscious you
win if you lose this trial then we shall
decide

  suppose he kills me objected kelly
but no one seemed to heed his protest

  han came glaring-eyed at him kelly
took a step backward jabbed tentatively
with his left fist han rushed forward
kelly punched furiously kneed the on-
rushing body heard it grunt and fall to
leap erect instantly a tingle of joy ran
down kellys spine and more confidently
he stepped forward lashing out with
rights and lefts han leapt close and
clinched his arms around kellys body
now he began to squeeze and kelly felt
a power greater than any mans in those
green-glowing arms

  the jewel came a sly thought sparks
were exploding in kellys eyes his ribs
creaked he swung a frenzied hand claw-
ing at hans neck he felt a hard pro-
tuberance he dug his nails under tore
the jewel free

  a shrill cry of utmost pain and horror
-and the god-man puffed away into black
smoke which babbled in a frenzy back and

forth through the darkness it surged
around kelly arid little tendrils of the
smoke seemed to pluck at the jewel clench-
ed in his hand but they had no great
force and kelly found he could repel the
wisps with the power of his own brain

  he suddenly understood the function of
the jewel it was the focus for the god it
centralized the myriad forces the jewel
gone the god was a welter of conflicting
volitions vagrant impulses

  kelly felt the antagonists triumphant
thoughts and he himself felt an elation
he had never known before the leaders
cool comment brought him back to him-
self 

  you seem to have won the contest
there was a pause in the absence of
opposition we will render any requests you
may make there was no concern in his
thoughts for the decentralized han the
black smoke was dissipating han was no
more than a memory already you have
delayed us long we have the problem
of- the now familiar confusion of ideas
but this time kelly understood vaguely
it seemed that there was a vortex of uni-
verses which possessed consciousness as
mighty or mightier than these gods which
was driving on a course that would be
incommoding there were qualifications
a host of contributory factors

  well said kelly id like you to move
the planet i just came from back to its
old orbit around magra taratempos if
you know what planet and what star im
talking about

  yes the leader made a small exer-
tion the world you mention moves in
its previous orbit

  suppose the han priests come through
the portal and want it moved again
the portal no longer exists it was
held open by han when han dissolved
the portal closed  is that the total of
your desires

  kellys mind raced became a turmoil
this was his chance wealth longevity
power knowledge    somehow thoughts
would not form themselves-and there
were curses attached to unnatural gifts-
id like to get back to bucktown
safely  

  kelly found himself in the glare of the
temple

outer world he stood on the hill above
bucktown and he breathed the salt air
of the marshes above hung a hot white
sun-magra taratempos

  he became aware of an object clenched
in his hand it was the jewel he had tom
out of hans neck there were two others
in his pocket

  across the citx fo saw the light-blue

smashers whidf lflhibit youf  pages they seem
almost superficial and petty in comparison yet
looking below the surface one finds a good
story like asteroid of fear for in-
stance

  well well i see leigh brackett has resurrected
the poor mans john carter i had been begin-
ning to think hed fallen into an ice fissure on
mercury cold side or been done in by one of
those beautiful but deadly females hes always
encountering no such luck black amazon
hauls down fourth place anyway for an interest-
ing ninety minutes and a special award jointly
to brackett and anderson for wost kept secret
of the year and i doubt if the ciara n de-
picted by anderson could lift that axe much
less throw it ah well small points at best and
a lovely cover regardless im mad about yel-
low less eyestrain you know

  van vogt would have ranked higher but for
his usual vagueness and lack of color fyfe was
fine but somebody has to be last

  now tell me sir just how did you get such
illustrations to go with the stories did you get
an increase in your budget or are you using
blackmail  a cartier two orbans and even
mayan and vestal have improved had to hap-
pen sooner or later now that youve broken
you-know-whos monopoly on cartier keep him
a while use logical argument if that doesnt
work try leg-irons

  as usual the vizigraph was most interesting
i vote for gibson strong and beale i hope
dennis strong realizes the extent of the hornets
nest he has stirred up advice dennis for the
next two months dont answer the door unarmed
dont leave the house and soak all packages
thoroughly in water a concrete shelter in the
basement might help too

  matter of fact ive felt about the same way
after reading some of la vizis offerings but
i used discretion and contented myself with a
few deep-throated growls after all i want to
make friends in the world of science-fiction not
enemies besides dennis what would we letter-
hacks do if we couldnt fire these meaningless
excrescences at the long-suffering editors
wed be bundles of frustrations-i would any-
way with a few exceptions everybody keeps
it light and nobody gets hurt climb down from
your ivory tower friend and join us pseudo-

dear mr bixby

  whilst browsing through the march ps i
chanced to come across the communique in la
vizi from friend dennis strong instantly if
not sooner i dislodged the lush blonde who was
entwined around my neck tossed recklessly aside
the volume on nuclear physics i was reading
with my other eye and blasted open my vault in
the atomic storm cellar having extracted two
cents from said vault i would like to toss them
into the fray hokay

  there is some point to mr strongs explosion
but hardly a staggering amount of course it is
disconcerting to run across readers who cannot
distinguish between bradbury and a comic book
of course not all attempts at humor are scream-
ingly funny of course there is a lunatic fringe
-there always is but to damn the faithful as
parasitical dilettantes seems to me to be going
a bit far after all it was these same parasites
who did much to keep science-fiction going in
the dark days when stfantasy was the skeleton in
the closet of literature-they supported it they
introduced it to their friends they risked ridicule
because they were intelligent enough to believe
in what they liked

  it is rather interesting i think to look back
at some of the old letter columns the parasites
bigawd have some startlingly whoops familiar
names-jack williamson henry kuttner john
w campbell jr robert bloch then asimov
and bradbury-and still later larry shaw gene
hunter milt lesser and the rest as shakes-
peare once said if these be parasites then what
a rogue and peasant slave am i from a mid-
summer nights bem act ii scene iv

  i feel that the letter writers definitely have
contributed a great deal to science fiction and i
say more power to them some of my best friends
are letter writers just because the field  is
growing up is no reason to put on the drooping
face and read ps with the saturday review in
one hand and a slide rule in the other lets have
some fun along the way and a nice screwball
letter never hurt anyone we live in a democracy
im told and opinions are bound to be at vari-
ance it is only when everyone thinks alike that
the things in which we believe are in danger
neither mr strong nor anyone else is in a
position to state dogmatically that it shall be
thus-and-so and that you shall read only this-

it was a lesson you learned in the space-forces and you
learned it good out in the lonely void when you get in
a jam youre on your own    its you against everything
and everybody anything goes   

the phone rang and ed
kerry wasnt doing anything so he
picked it up and said yeah

  he said yeah a few more times his
eyes widening infinitesmally each time and
finally wound up with okay bunny
he hung up and said that was bun-
ny up in oneonta she says a guy is
coming in from luna with a kid for emer-
gency hospitalization radiation burns or
something

  jake was sitting back in his swivel
chair his feet on the desk and his hands
clasped behind his head he growled
thats the trouble with women in this
game theyve got no story sense she
phones all the way from oneonta on a
story thats been run a hundred times
every time somebody gets good and sick
up on luna they bring em to earth for
treatment he shrugged okay so its
a kid this time do up about a stick of it
kerry and well put it on page three if
you can work it into a tear-jerker

  ed kerry said you didnt let me
finish jake somethings wrong with this
guys radio

  somebody on the rewrite desk said
something wrong with his radio hes
gotta have his radio or he cant come in
jake took his feet from the desk and sat
up whatd ya mean somethings
wrong with his radio

  bunny said hes calling for his landing
instructions but they cant get anything
jziil- ar ihm hes just reached brenn-
schluss and hes in free fall now itll be
four days before he gets here thats the
way they work it-hes supposed to get


in touch with the spaceport he wants to
land at and   

  i know how they work it jake growl-
ed see if theres anything on the last
news wire from luna about him

  phil mooney flicked his set on again and
repeated carefully calling oneonta space-
port phil mooney outbound luna call-
ing oneonta spaceport come in oneonta
calling phil mooney calling phil moo-
ney oneonta spaceport calling phil moo-
ney come in mooney

  he cast a quick glance back at the child
strapped carefully in the metal bunk she
was unconscious now possibly as a re-
sult of the acceleration in leaving luna
hed had to reach a speed of approximate-
ly two miles per second to escape earths
satellite and that had called for more gs
acceleration than lillians sick body could
bear his lips thinned back over his teeth j
it would be even worse when they came
in for landing and he had to brake against
earths gravity

  he switched on the set again to give it
another try instructions were to contact
the spaceport at which you planned to land
as soon as possible there was plenty of
time of course but the sooner the better

  he said calling oneonta spaceport
this is phil mooney luna calling one-
onta come in oneonta

  calling phil mooney calling phil moo-
ney oneonta spaceport calling phil moo-
ney come in mooney

  ed kerry came back to the city room
with a sheet of yellow paper that hed tom

	planet

off the radiotype

  he said here it is jake this kid-
her name is lillian marshall-is the only
survivor of an explosion at that nuclear-
fission laboratory they had on the dark side
her old man and her mother were work-
ing under this professor deems both of
them killed

  his eyes went on scanning the story
evidently this phil mooney runs an tin-
scheduled spaceline anyway he blasted
off to rush the kid to an earth hospital

  jake took the dispatch and scowled at
it kerry he growled see what we got
on this phil mooney in the morgue he
rubbed the end of his nose thoughtfully
theyll probably pick him up all right
when he gets nearer

  somebody on rewrite said it doesnt
make any difference how far he is they
should be able to reach him even if he was
halfway to mars somethings wrong with
his set

  he decided to try one of the other space-
ports as a matter of fact it made very
little difference at which of them he land-
ed thered be suitable hospital facilities
within reasonable distance of any space-
port he was three days out now and
according to spaceways custom had to let
them know he was coming in it wasnt
like landing an airplane-they want plenty
of time to prepare for a spacecrafts ar-
rival

  he said calling new albuquerque
spaceport calling new albuquerque
spaceport phil mooney luna calling
new albuquerque please come in new
albuquerque

  calling phil mooney calling phil moo-
ney new albuquerque spaceport calling
phil mooney we are receiving you per-
fectly come in mooney

  he tried once more

  calling new albuquerque spaceport
calling new albuquerque spaceport
please come in new albuquerque emer-
gency repeat emergency please come in

  calling phil mooney calling phil moo-
ney we are receiving you perfectly moo-
ney come in mooney

stories

  kitty kildare took up her notes and
prepared to make her way back to her
own tiny office

  ive got it jake she said breathlessly
kitty was always breathless over any story
carrying more pathos than a basketball
score my column tomorrowll have them
melting actually i mean

  jake shuddered inwardly after she left
ed kerry came up and drooped on the
edge of the desk

  heres the dope on this phil mooney
jake he said hes about thirty was in
the last war and saw action when we had
our space-forces storming new petrograd
did some fighting around the satellites
too piloted a one seater got a couple of
medals but never really made big news
got any pix of him

  ed kelly shook his head like i said
he never really made the big news just
one more of these young fellas that saw
plenty of action and when the war was
over was too keyed up to settle down to
everyday life

  jake picked up the thin folder and rif-
fled through the few clippings there
whats he doing now he growled

  evidently when the war ended he got
one of these surplus freighters and con-
verted it name of his company is mooney
space service sounds impressive but hes
the only one in it probably going broke
most of those guys are-cant make the
grade against the competition of terra-
luna spaceways and the other big boys
with the scheduled flights

  the city editor scratched the end of his
nose speculatively maybe we ought to
have jim do up an editorial on these un-
scheduled spacelines something along the
line of how heroic some of these guys are
that sort of stuff do up the idea that
theyre always ready fair weather or foul
to make an emergency trip   

  kerry said there isnt any weather
fair or foul in space

  jake scowled at him you know what
i mean wise guy meanwhile get somg
statements from some authorities

  ed kerry said painfully what state-
ments from what authorities

  the city editor glared at him so help
me ed im going to sticj yoy on ogfcj
mercy

tmries any statements from any au-
thorities you know damn well what i
mean get some doctor to beef about the
fact there arent suitable hospitalization
facilities on luna get some president of
one of these unscheduled spacelines to
sound off about what a hero mooney is
and how much good these unscheduled
spacelines are-and that reminds me of
something-

  he yelled to a tall lanky reporter at the
far end of the city room hey ted get
bunny on the line up in oneonta and tell
her i said to look up some of these un-
scheduled spacelines guys and see if she
can get a photograph of phil mooney from
them maybe hes got some buddies in
oneonta

  there was one thing about being in free
fall you had lots of time to sit and think
too much time perhaps

  you had the time to think it all over
and over and over again

  there was the war which had tom you
from the routine into which life had set-
tled from friends and relations and sweet-
hearts and thrown you into a one man
space-fighter in which you sometimes stay-
ed for weeks on end without communica-
tion with anyone friend or foe

  there had probably been no equivalent
situation in the history of past warfare to
the one man space-scouts the nearest
thing to them might have been the flyers
of  in the first world war--but of
course they were up there alone only for
hours at a time not weeks

  you develop self-reliance men was
the way the colonel had put it you de-
velop self-reliance or youre sunk

  youre in space by yourself alone
you cant use your radio or they can lo-
cate you if something happens some
emergency or some contact with the
enemy youre on your own you have
to figure it out theres no superior officer
to do your thinking youre the whole
works

  and the colonel had been right of
bourse it was a matter of using your own
wits your own ability fighting in a
space-scout was the work of an indi-
vidual not of a team perhaps it would

flight	

be different someday in the future when
machines and instruments had been devel-
oped further but now it was an individ-
ualistic game each man for himself

  and probably it was because of this
training that he phil mooney was unable
to get back into the crowd after the war
had ended he was an individualist who
rebelled against working not only for but
even with someone else

  he should have known better industry
had reached beyond the point where one
man goes out by himself and makes a for-
tune-or even a living he thought wryly
its the day of the big concerns of tre-
mendous trusts and cartels who didnt
even have to bother with the task of
squeezing out tiny competitors like him-
self he was out before he started

  the mooney space service he snorted
in self deprecation

  oh well

  he pulled himself erect and made his
way to the bunk the kid was awake he
grinned down at her and said hows
it going lillian

  her eyes seemed glazed even worse than
theyd been yesterday but she tried to
smile back at him all right she whis-
pered her childs voice so low he could
hardly make it out wheres mother   

  phil mooney held a finger to his lips
maybe youd better not talk too much
lillian your mother and father are   
theyre all right the thing now is to get
you to the hospital and make you well
again understand 

  kitty kildare was saying indignantly
whats this about no insurance on
luna

  use your head kitty jake grunted
what companyd be crazy enough to in-
sure anybody working on luna by the
way that was a good piece on mooney and
the marshall kid

  did you read it kitty kildare was
pleased

  he shuddered no but the letters have
been pouring in maybe you ought to do
another take it from some other angle
this time

  thats why i wanted to know about
the insurance do you realize that this

child this poor sick defenseless child is
penniless actually i mean bad enough
that her parents have left her an orphan
but jake that child is penniless

  all right all right he told her work
on that for tomorrows column

  ed came up with another radiotype re-
port just as kitty was leaving this guy
mooneys calling all the other spaceports
now jake evidently hes getting desper-
ate hes only two days out and by the
way heres a new angle this guy harry
marshall the kids father was a war-time
buddy of phil mooney they went to cadet
school or something together

  jake growled thoughtfully he hasnt
got a chance but it makes a tremendous
story get somebody to rig up a set in the
radiotype room ed and well see if we
can listen in

  there was a desperate tense taut inflec-
tion in his voice now

  calling new albuquerque spaceport
or oneonta spaceport phil mooney calling
any earth spaceport phil mooney calling
oneonta new albuquerque casablanca
mukden any earth spaceport emergency

  ed kerry looked up over the set in the
radiotype room at the city editor he wet
his lips carefully and said hes only got
one day now theyve got to pick him up
in hours or hes sunk

  jake said i never did understand how
that works why cant he land himself i
know he cant but why

  the reporter shrugged i dont quite
get it either but evidently the whole opera-
tion is pretty delicate stuff they bring

him down with radar somehow or other
its not like landing an airplane landing
a spacecraft is done from the ground up-
not from the spacecraft down the
pilot has comparatively little to do about it
at least thats the way it is with nine
ships out of ten

   the set began to blare again and they
both listened tensely it was phil mooney

   listen you guys down there if youre
 sitting around playing craps or something
 im going- to have a few necks to break
 when i get down

   the two newspapermen stared at each
other over the set ed kerry ran his ton-
gue over his lips again

   the strained tone had gone from the
voice of the spacepilot now and had been
replaced by one of hopelessness he
said i dont know who i think im kid-
ding i know darn well that somethings
wrong with my receiver and i cant find
out what it is maybe my sender is off
too for all i know all i can pick up is
some girl singing something about white
roses white roses yet i want landing in-
structions and i get white roses

  ed kerry jerked his head up and snap-
ped holy jumping hell hes able to piclc
some commercial station

   jake came to his feet stuck his neck
out of the door and yelled at the top of his
voice phil mooney is receiving some
commercial station some dame singing
something about white roses check every
station in the city find out if any of them
are broadcasting some dame singing about
white roses

   ladies and gentlemen we interrupt this
 program for an emergency situation un-
 doubtedly you have heard on your news-
 casts and have read in your papers of the
 tragic case of lillian marshall child vic-
 tim of an atomic explosion on luna which
 orphaned her and necessitated her immedi-
 ate flight to an earth hospital

   for the past three days the spacecraft
carrying her piloted by war hero philip
mooney has been having trouble with its
radio due to circumstances surrounding
landing of spacecraft the two have been
given up as tost in spite of the fact that
almost hourly it has been possible to re-
mercy flight

 ieive messages from mooney

  it is now revealed that he is able to pick
lip this program on the interplanetary
broadcasting system network we are not
sure which of the nearly two thousand
stations of our system he is receiving but
we will now attempt to reach phillip moo-
ney with relayed messages from the one-
onta spaceport where expert medical care
is awaiting little lillian marshall

and scowled still obviously startled by the
swelling crowd

  who in kert are you he asked

  the other motioned for two assistants
to enter the ship and bring- out the child
tm doctor kern he said ill see  

  doctor adrian kern the radiation ex-
pert the pilot frowned worriedly see
here doctor the marshalls were friends of
mine and ive taken over the care of little
lillian but im-well im afraid i couldnt
afford to pay you  i mean  

  the famous doctor smiled at him ive
been retained by the interplanetary golden
heart phil you neednt worry about my
fee besides and he smiled easily im
not going to accept any fee for this case
you see i was listening to marsha malloy
singing love of white roses when your
call came through i believe it was the
most poignant experience i have ever been
through

  a girl next to the doctor gushed im
bunny davis mr mooney the managing
editor of our newspaper chain has author-
ized me to buy oiir story for five thousand
if youll just-

  phil mooney blinked i-i-

  a heavy-set man in a business suit grasp-
ed his hand and shook it with fervor while
flashbulbs went off blindingly phil he
said huskily as though moved by deep
emotion as president of the board of
directors of terra-luna spaceways i wish
to take this opportunity to offer you a
full-

  hey give us a smile phil a man
on top of a television truck yelled   

  he was headed back for luna the next
day

  theyd been indignant of course there
was hollywood and the television net-
works and that terra-luna spaceways
guy who wanted to get in on all the publi-
city by offering him a vice-presidency and
the newspaper editors and the magazine
editors and all the rest of them

  approximately a billion persons had
been tuned in to the interplanetary net-
work when the emergency landing instruc-
tions had been broadcast to him through
that system a billion persons had sat on

the edge of their chairs tensely as his ship
had been brought in

  he and little lillian had received more
publicity in the past twenty-four hours
than anyone since lindberg

  and the child would be all right now
before hed left checks totaling over a
quarter of a million had come in for her
donations from all over the earth and
from mars and venus and even some from
the jupiter satellites

  and offers of adoption thousands of
them from rich and poor-even includ-
ing marsha malloy the video star whod
been singing that song love of white
roses

  yes lillian would be all right he
wouldnt have been able to pay for the
medical care shed needed but now she
had the most capable experts on earth at
her disposal

  they had been indignant when he blast-
ed off again for luna theyd wanted to
make a hero of him this leaving on his
part they interpreted as modesty-which
come to think of it would make him all
the more of a hero

  phil mooney slipped a hand down to his
set and flicked it on he dialed over a
dozen different stations the news pro-
grams were all full of him and of lillian
youd think to hear them that he was
the noblest the most daring the greatest
man since alexander the great

  he grinned wryly one of the reasons
hed been so anxious to leave was to get
away before somebody thought to check
his set to see what was wrong with it
why if anybody had found that it was
actually in perfect shape theyd probably
have lynched him

  yeah the colonel had been right tn the
space-forces you learned to be self-reliant
when you got in a bad spot you figured
it out yourself youre on your own its
you against everything and everybody
anything goes

  his grin broadened maybe he wasnt a
hero-the way they were all painting him 
but at least lillian was all right now and
no longer penniless the way her parents
death had left her

  -and he wasnt doing so badly himself
           as madness stalked the sub-space liner telemachus
    terror howled from star-deck to tubes with its bloody

            spawn of death first mate dirk phillips knew that the
impossible was happening-piracy along the long arc

the crazed mob surged toward the levltafor shafts   

blackout in cygni

the main lights on d-deck

were out when dirk phillips came
off watch and only the dim glo-
pups whiled away their half-lives behind
the moldings above far down in the
bowels of the telemachus the geotrons
purred a deep sonorous sound somehow
vaguely comforting

  dirk was not comforted things were
too quiet and too much hell was waiting
to pop somewhere along the long arc
down the corridor the blank doors of the
deluxe suites regarded him and from be-
hind one of them came a muffled feminine
giggle dirk scowled and increased his
pace the empty-headed whinny followed
him as he rounded a corner

  youll giggle out of the other side of
your mouth if you get in jasons hands
you damned parasite

  dirk hated the passengers on d-deck
on principle they were his charges but
no more so than the thousand centaurian
laborers and their families packed into the
cubicles down in supercargo-pioneers
bound for a world that hadnt even been
named yet  cygni c-ii these gilded
loungers topside were the spectators the
pleasure-palace builders the representa-
tives of the big power and mining cartels
   people who could pay two thousand
credits for a d-deck suite only because of
the sweating of people like the ones below

  it would be nice dirk reflected idly if
the telemachus could be split horizontally
up her middle sending the centaurians on
to their epochal job of establishing earths
second interstellar colony-and leaving the
top two decks behind floundering in sub-
space waiting for the man who called him-
self jason or perhaps to let jason himself
pick over the moneyed cream for ransom-
no that wouldnt work jason would
simply pitch the poorer people out the
airlocks for they had no one back home
who might pay ransom for them that was
sop with jason

  voices murmured ahead of him he
stepped over the low doorway into the
star deck the big bubble forward of cen-
ter on the midline of the ship it was an
odd hour for anyone to be looking at the
scenery but then few passengers ever
got oriented to the twenty-hour ships
day third watch might be sleepy-time
for dirk but for a passenger it might just
as easily be the equivalent of  a m
earth time or  centaurian

  he recognized one of the figures at once
-jerry sanders the telemachus new
third mate there was a girl with him
and a stocky broad-shouldered man in

civvies the man saw dirk at the same
time and gestured

  theres another officer - maybe he
knows i say commodore

for a moment dirk was tempted
to go on without answering among
the people on d-deck whom he would
cheerfully dunk in boiling wine those who
hailed him as if he were a bell-hop were
high on the list however he couldnt
pretend that he hadnt heard the summons
-it had rung like a tocsin through the big
dome-and rank discourtesy to a passen-
ger would be out of character grudgingly
he swerved and walked over to the little
group

  what can i do for you he said mild-

ty-

  couple of questions the heavy man
said with bluff heartiness mr sanders
here cant seem to make them quite clear
were on overdrive now arent we

  certainly you can hear the geotrons

  aha thats what i said now then
how does it happen that things dont
look any different he gestured through
the clear stellite including the whole uni-
verse in his category of things
shouldnt there be warping or some-
thing 

  there is dirk said a little stiffly
but it takes some knowledge of the stars
to recognize it had you been up here
when overdrive first went on youd have
seen the starfield scramble itself thor-
oughly

  but shouldnt there be some color-
changes too

  yes and no youre not seeing by light
you know youre looking at what might
be called the backsides of the stars-not
the components which exist in free space
but the considerable masses of their cores
which are extruded into subspace

  rather disappointing the big man
said i expected something more ah un-
usual

  such as the nameless hues the vision
writers prate about well those hues are
probably there-but your eyes cant see
them thats why theyre nameless they
dont need names
blackout

  the big man laughed that settles me
he said jovially eh nadya if some o
the scripters back home could hear their
boss told off like that-

  dirk stiffened momentarily their boss
there was only one man on earth or
centaurus who could call ham-self that
this burly bird must be james henry
stapledon king-pin of the visicast net-
works of two systems evidently he was
on his way to extend his empire over a
third the girl was probably his secre-
tary-

  dirk became aware suddenly that the
girl was watching him with dark-eyed
amusement he swung angrily on jerry

mr sanders arent you aware that the
next watch is yours if we rim into any
trouble youll wish youd had your sleep
sanders flushed my off-watch times
my own

  oh come now dont be hard on the
lad stapledon protested hes here at
my request anyhow what trouble could
we encounter out here

  the questions seemed rhetorical surely
the vision magnate knew all there was to
know about jason knock off jerry
dirk said youve got four hours left to
go and i dont relish the idea of a shaky
hand at the boards up front

  yessir sanders said sullenly it was
obvious that he hated to be ordered to bed
in front of the girl but he had no choice
dirk watched him until his slender back
was framed against the glo-pup shimmer
in the levitator shaft then he turned to
the two passengers

  sorry he said but were a little
on edge this trip theres a lot at stake
if jasons greed stops this third wave of
colonization there may never be another
we cant any of us afford a moments in-
attention

  quite right quite right stapledon
said we appreciate the attention com-
modore goodnight

  goodnight dirk said through sud-
denly clenched teeth he turned his back
on them and strode off just as he was
entering the shaft the girl laughed the
silvery sound cascaded through the dome
he felt himself flushing and cut off the
shaft at b-deck

in cygnl	

it had been nearly a century since
the first interstellar passenger liner had
turned back toward earth only a quarter
of the way along toward centaurus iii
with a cargo of madness and death

  it had happened according to the few
surviving crewmen when the lights had
been turned off for the second watch
dozens of learned tomes had been written
about it since then but no-one had ever
gotten much beyond the simple facts the
lights had gone off and the passengers had
rioted there was something about being
driven between the stars at nine times
the speed of light which was different from
ordinary interplantary flight in a lightless
cabin the darkness closed in you were
horribly uniquely alone pitching headlong
into a pit of absolute emptiness   

  perhaps-just perhaps-that was the
way it was those who had come sane
through the first blackout could not be
sure they had been lucky enough to be
on duty near a source of light those
who had been in the cabins had gone mad
within a few moments

  after that the switchless inextinguish-
able glo-pups had been installed by act
of council and the general orders on
blackouts had become a part of the space-
ways manual there was even a glo-pup
at the head of every bed next to the visi-
tape screen casting its dim radiance up
toward the ceiling on the ledge next to
the pillow there was also a mask for the
glo-pup but most of the masks gathered
dust

  dirk stripped off his jacket took off
his shoes and socks and put the mask
over the light he was as afraid of the
interstellar pit as any spaceman but he
had sense enough to know that half his
fear was of something he knew to be harm-
less while he was alone the fear of what
other people might do while he could not
see them on this flight there was no tell-
ing who or what might be watching wher-
ever there was light   

  in the stifling darkness he groped to
his locker and spun the combination work-
ing with fingers which had often con-
quered tougher puzzles than an ordinary
baggage locker inside behind his gaudy
dress-jacket was a worn holster with a
	planet

heavy cyclast in it it was a tough star-
mans boast that he slept in the dark and
the man who was telling the truth had
little to fear from marauders - it took
something more than guts to walk into a
totally black room out here-but dirk
slept with the cyclast all the same there
was no telling what was due to happen
this trip-

  his fingers found the holster the heat-
stained familiar weapon was gone

  the shock of surprise was doubled and
redoubled in the boundless gloom fight-
ing down his panic he ran quick fingers
through his jacket along the floor of
the locker gone all right of course it
was illegal for an officer to maintain arms
outside the ships arsenal but nobody on
the bridge had any reason to be pawing
through dirks effects-

  sanders 

  ridiculous dirk had hardly spoken to
sanders until tonight the fledgling re-
sentment the third mate might have felt
at being packed off to his crib couldnt
have taken wing this quickly

 there was only one answer there was
someone on board the telemachus who
was an agent of jason

  dirk padded back to his bunk and sat
down rubbing the blond stubble on his
chin it fitted almost it seemed as if it
fitted too patly to be true after the cen-
trale-ganymede war some units of the
ganymedian navy had been sold as sur-
plus to private firms before the centrale
council could get a complete inventory of-
what it had won among the sold ships
had been several heavy sub-cruisers the
man who called himself jason had some-
how had the liquid cash to buy one hed
turned it to piracy and had made a good
thing of intercepting the big clumsy liners
on the interstellar run-

  except that a ship on overdrive was
supposed to be indetectable every physi-
cist in the system swore that it was im-
possible to pirate a sub-ship no matter
how big it was so the obvious conclusion
was that the piracies had been inside jobs
and the theft of dirks cyclast on this trip
of all trips seemed to point the same way
disgustedly he reached for the glc-pup
mask

stories

soft knock on the cabin door
arrested his hand in mid-air there
was a kangaroo-shiv in the belt of his
dress jacket but it was a duelling weapon
and he decided against fighting ovei
trifles

  yes he said

  the door opened hesitantly it was the
girl modeled against the hazy glow she
was startlingly lovely she peered help-
lessly into the unexpected darkness one
hand at her throat one smooth knee bent

  mr phillips

  dirks hand resumed its arrested arc
and the glo-pup once more stared inno-
cently at the ceiling he leaned on one
elbow and studied his visitor hed hardly
gotten a glance at her before-and she was
something to look at

  her hair was a waterfall of black silk
with blue highlights in it and her eyes
were violet and slightly slanted - not
enough to suggest the oriental yet giv-
ing her face a piquancy that was hard to
resist the fashionable centaurian toga
with its slit from waist to toe and its heavy
golden shiv-chain locking the waist
wouldnt have been tolerated on tabu-
ridden earth-but then there were few
women left on earth who could wear such
clothing successfully the active lithe-
bodied people who roamed the interstellar
frontier were almost a different race dirk
noticed wryly that the shiv-chain wasnt
empty the massive handle of the weapon
itself lay across one gently rounded hip

  thats me he said somewhat belated-
ly then youre armed

  the girl bit her lip and reached for the
clasp of the golden chain dirk raised his
hand quickly

  please dont those damned togas look
like nightgowns when theyre unbound
and im not sure i could stand the shock
what do you want

  may i close the door she said stiffly

  its your reputation not mine get on
with it sanders may want to lose sleep
off watch but i dont

  youre very gracious she said she
shut the door and leaned against it her
hands behind her back im nadya
storm

  dirks eyebrows shot up i wish id
blackout

had a chance to look at the passenger list
first stapledon-and now the daughter
of kurt storm top centrale council
woodenhead and to think i took you for
a centaurian i should have known better
oh nadya said coldly why
because the real centaurians are down
in supercargo-not lolling around on d-
deck at two thousand per

  she shrugged im going to cygni for
the same reason they are-to work im
covering the colonization for itn the
d-deck rooms were mr stapledons idea
   but that doesnt matter you seem to
be spoiling for a fight if you cant stop
fencing ill take my questions to captain
muir

  youll get short shrift there staple-
don notwithstanding i promise you but
dirk relaxed a little it was hard not to
be curious over what had brought her here
at this hour and harder still to resist the
sheer beauty of her well maybe i have
been a bit brusque but the long arc is
a dangerous one and i havent had much
time for polishing up my manners go
ahead

he straightened with an im-
possibly graceful flowing motion and
walked over to the single chair her slim
legs kicking the toga into a swirl about
her knees why is it so dangerous she
said this jason whoever he is has
worked out a way to pirate an overdrive
ship but surely it would be possible to
give merchant vessels an escort-or even
to arm them we did both during the
war

  sure its possible the telemachus is
armed-you didnt know that well she
is you cant see it from star deck but
theres a turret with two synchrons in it
under the ships belly and murder-guns-
pom-poms-all along her periphery but
during the war those guns were manned
by patrol crews who knew their business
now the patrols being demobbed and if
we get into trouble well have to put or-
dinary merchant ratings into the turret
our gunnery officers a good man but he
cant be in the turret and on the bridge
at the same time as for a convoy-you
should know more about that than i do

in cygni	

  if i did i wouldnt be asking

  your father and his egg-headed young
crony paul haagen were the first coun-
cilmen to call for eternal peace and pros-
perity-and the reduction of the patrol to
a fifth of its normal strength the patrol
has its hands full now just enforcing the
spaceways act in the system let alone
having monitors to spare this far out
he saw her delicate eyebrows arch in
puzzlement and added this jason has
a demobbed ganymedian cruiser a screen
of smaller vessels wouldnt do us a bit of
good he could immobilize them by threat-
ening to blast us the minute the others
fired on him it takes a bigger vessel than
a heavy to beat a heavy to the punch a
battleplane will do but a monitors better
but monitors are too big to use except
outside the asteroids surely there must
be some to spare out here

  dirk laughed sure but theres a mass
limit on overdrive the liners are just
under that limit monitors are way over
it with a monitor escort itd take us
about  years to get to  cygni from
centaurus with everybody sick from ac-
celeration pressure most of the time

  the girl frowned and was silent dirk
said may i ask some questions

  why not

  why do you want to know all this 
tm a vision announcer as i said
nadya replied abstractedly were going
to do a take on the first landing and i
wanted details about the dangers of the
trip im not sure i can use much of this
though - the political element is touchy

  why do you carry a shiv dirk asked
suddenly

  its fashionable she said abruptly
she came out of her study she stood up
swung to the door and stepped out into
the corridor at the last instant she looked
back at him and smiled

  mine she said has a propelling
charge in it

  the next instant she was gone leaving
dirk with his jaw hanging the smile had
been gorgeous but that final speech cer-
tainly didnt go with it hed been pumped
outthought and shiwed where it counted
he had half a mind to drag the girl back
		planet

in again and demand an accounting-

  a sudden choking pall of darkness
dropped over his head and shoulders cut-
ting the thought off it took him nearly
a second to accept what had happened

  the glo-pup had gone out

in the thick blackness dirk
churned his way to the locker and into
the dress blouse the shiv at least was
still in it he zipped the heavy cloth closed
with nervous fingers and jerked the blouse
roughly into order the shoes could sit
where they were-whatever had happened
the silence of bare feet might be useful

  it was anything but silent in the corri-
dor the deck shuddered to the running
of scores of feet and doors banged in
their slots there were shouts and frantic
scramblings and scattered screams the
glo-pups were out in the corridor too
probably all over the ship it was impos-
sible but they were out

  blackout

  someone thudded into dirks shoulder
and grabbed at him hands locked around
his throat heavy shoes kicked at his shins
he balled one fist over the other and
drove his arms up with all his strength-

  the man hanging onto him howled and
tumbled backwards grimly dirk ploughed
through the struggling mob thirty meters
ahead there was a companionway to the
bow-if he could reach it he wondered
if nadya had managed to reach her cabin
before-

   btsiiiirrrrrrrrrr 

  he threw himself flat against the cold
metal of the deck the shiv ricocheted and
went racketing down the corridor yowling
blue murder someone stepped on dirks
right hand hard

  someone was lying next to him he
dug his bare toes against the metal and
tried to swim away from under the tramp-
ling feet a small wiry hand dug into his
biceps

  lie still nadyas voice hissed or
ill put a shiv in your kidneys-

  dirk didnt stop to bow from the waist
not exactly anyhow he doubled himself
up suddenly catching the girl a sickening
blow in the solar plexus then he caught
the suddenly-relaxed hand on his arm and

stories

dragged her after him if he could get
them both over against the wall-

  somehow he made it his captive was
beginning to struggle again he took her
by the hair and dragged her ear over
against his mouth

  stop it he growled the girl bucked
once but the cruel blow dirk had dealt
her had taken its toll its me-phillips
this is a blackout theres worse to come
dont attract any attention

  he locked his free arm about her under
them the deck shuddered spasmodically
a second later the wild howling of the
general alarm rang through the tubes
dirks lips skinned back from his teeth
leave it to muir nothing like a siren
to pile madness on top of madness

  the mob surged toward the levitator
shafts every last man trying to claw up to
star deck where there was at least an
allusion of open spaces after several eter-
nities b-deck was quiet except for a
hopeless moaning somewhere astern dirk
loosened his hold on the girl

  all right he said lets go-and
make it fast

  im quite all right she said angrily
no thanks to you and your educated
knees if youll let go of me ill go to my
cabin

  you little fool d-deck is a madhouse
now everyones trying to jam up there
the only safe place in this whole ship is
on the bridge travel

  he drove her forward to the stairwell
at the telemachus nose there was a light
there and dirk felt a vague shame at
the surge of relief that went through him
when foe saw it two of the crewmen were
high up in the well heat-rifles at the
ready and the beam of a dismounted land-
ing-light poured down the shaft as dirk
propelled the girl into the column of light
iboth rifles snapped up

  ahoy up there he called at ease
this is first mate phillips

  the flared muzzles did not waver we
know who you are one of the space-
men said point is are you potty
nah he aint potty the other one
said he sleeps in the dark aint you
heard come on up sir

  dirk went up the winding ladder sup-
blackout

porting the exhausted girl at the port
which let out onto star deck a red-headed
little man in civvies crouched with his
back to the well a tape-ike jammed
through the judas -he was cursing exul-
tantly dirk stopped and stared at him
hey you-

  its johnny hask nadya said
cameraman johnny-

  the red-head waved them both away
with his free hand dont muss me up
he said dont muss see what a pic-
ture two thousand passengers riot in
interstellar void terror on the long
arc what a picture go way nadya
youll get your crack at it when we dub
in the commentary

  dirk grinned however the little vision
man had gotten here he was obviously
having the time of his life he took the
girls arm again

on the bridge muir was jab-
bing at the power-boards and roar-
ing anathemas at chicken-livers who were
afraid of a little darkness the glow of a
jury-rigged ethon-tube gleamed on his
bald head the navigators desk was emp-
ty dirk let the girl slump into the empty
seat and yanked the g a switch out of
its blades the siren wow-wowed away
into silence like a damned soul dwindling
into hell

  what the- muir bellowed then
oh its you phillips get me an orbit
check fast and cut that alarm in again v
dirk fed tape into the big integraph
id advise against the alarm sir every-
ibodys at stations that can get to them
in this ink the siren just doubles the
terror among the passengers

  the passengers muir looked stun-
ned as if the passengers were tilings he
had forgotten until now they should
have been gassed ten minutes ago

  dirk automatically grabbed for his
nose the filters werent there hed ac-
tually forgotten them-thered been no
gas that damned sanders-

  here sir the third mates voice said
he came through the d-deck hatch with
stapledon the vision boss at his heels
both of them looked considerably mussed
up

in cygni	

  what is this a game muir said a
fine bunch of officers interstellar gives me
-too busy rescuing their favorite civilians
to remember their general orders i sup-
pose you wouldnt pull the gas til you
had this man on the bridge eh

  no sir sanders said swallowing i
mean yes sir i did but nothing hap-
pened i pulled toggles at every station
from my cabin to here and didnt get any
gas

  eh no gas no lights-i hope to
heaven weve got power phillips

  were still on course sir dirk said

  all right sanders get a party and
run down the trouble in the main lighting
lines the captains blunt hands readied
for the geotron cutout at the same in-
stant dirk hurled himself from the inte-
graph in a flying tackle

  muir came down with a heavy thud
but he struck fighting he was a big man
and a hard one it was like trying to wres-
tle a lion somehow he got one foot planted
in dirks dhest and heaved his thigh-
muscles knotting under his tight uniform
dirk felt himself flying a second later
he smashed into the far wall and muir
had a shiv pointed at his middle

  now then mr phillips muir said
breathing heavily since youre the big
brave man who sleeps in the dark we
cant assume that youve got the madness
explain yourself and make it good

  dirk fought for breath nadya was
watching him with wide terrified eyes
sanders had snatched a heat-rifle from the
rack and was hefting it uncertainly

  the geotrons dirk gasped dont
cut them-

  and why not mister you know the
general orders on blackouts - gas the
passengers cut the overdrive send out
visicarrier sos-my god weve had that
stuff pounded into us ever since we were
oilers

  this is different jasons in the vici-
nity

  the shiv did not move jason muir
said if hes around overdrive wont
do us any good id sooner be in free space
where i could maneuver he picked up
the intercom mike synchros 

  gunnery officer
	planet

  hello sims i thought youd been
trampled battle stations report down the
line on the murder guns

-	begging your pardon sir the inter-
phone said but i dont have any handlers
or any power if you could give me a
rig from the accumulators i could man-
handle the turret

  muir swore all right he said good
boy build a field quick his blunt fin-
gers clacked plungers banking the accu-
mulators into the synchrotron circuits

  youll never make it dirk said flat-
ly the pom-poms are pea-shooters even
if you do get them manned and sims cant
beat a cruiser to the draw without hand-
lers you cant fight the telemachus cap-
tain

  i mean to try mister muir said i
wont surrender my ship fat pig as she
is and if jason is out there you can ex-
plain to a summary court-martial how you
knew about it beforehand he grasped
the big jackknife handle the twin plun-
gers of the overdrive switch leapt out of
their sockets

  the humming of the geotrons died in
the forward viewplate the stars swirled
like dustmotes in a sunbeam changing
colors with impossible rapidity skyrocket-
ing up into the violet blinking out reap-
pearing at the red end of the spectrum
and running the gamut again it was as if
a gods dream of stellar order had been
broken and dispersed by some cosmic
alarm-clock

  muir watched his fists clenching and
opening dirlc tensed for a new spring
but sanders had the heat-rifle on him
the third mate was biting his lip keep-
ing his eyes off the plate by sheer funk
it was not pleasant to be a green officer
in a space-bound madhouse   

  against the swirling stars a ghostly
ship formed

there was a sobbing breath from
stapledon he stumbled to the bulk-
head yanked the hatch open it was dark
beyond the hatch but stapledon suddenly
did not appear to care he went out his
ragged breathing merging with the surf of
terrified moaning beating up from below

  the ghost ship solidified a long tur-

stomues

ret-knotted torpedo scarcely ten miles
away the stars scuttled affrightedly for
their proper places and froze

  well dirk said grimly

  muir spun on him thats the argo
all right and shes already got her turrets
coming to bear on us he glared at dirk
like an infuriated bear talk

  dirk shrugged simple enough cap-
tain its impossible to pirate a ship on
overdrive we have to assume that the
main body of evidence-not all of it but
most of it-points that way and to assume
the opposite is to leave ourselves without
any jumping-off place

  i didnt ask for a lesson in logic mis-
ter

  consequently dirk said evenly it
followed that the liners jason pirated mere
in free space-not on overdrive why
what reason could a liner have for cut-
ting overdrive

  they had a blackout sanders whis-
pered

  yes they cut their geotrons as the
general orders require jason evidently
knew in advance when the lights would go
out and could manage to be nearby on a
matched course then the moment the
liner appeared in free space his detectors
spotted it and he got there in nothing
flat on his own overdrive if the liner sent
out an sos as the orders require why
so much the better it led jason to his
victim practically by the nose

  very pretty muir frowned obvious-
ly dirks sudden assault upon his author-
ity was hard to reconcile with his view
of the situation yet if the telemachus was
actually under threat of piracy-

  after a long moment he jammed his
shiv back into its scabbard ill have to
trust you phillips though god knows
you could have engineered the blackout as
well as anyone else on board but i need
you to fight the ship put up that rifle mr
sanders and muster me some pom-pom
crews

  as if in answer twin bolts of greenish
light leapt from the argo tis dorsal tur-
ret the telemachus boomed like a cracked
bass drum the concussion knocked them
all to the deck the alarm siren cut in
again muir surged to his knees and
blackout

glowered at the blinkers

  aft cargo hold he said his nose
was bleeding but he didnt look a bit
funny where the hell-ah

  a ragged comb of death swept along
the port side of the telemachus the mur-
der guns-some of them anyhow dirk
touched nadyas shoulder reassuringly and
squeezed himself into the gunnery officers
chair there was a chance-jason might
not have expected the liner to be in any
shape to fight back-

  a bright blue-white flower burst into
bloom on the argo iis flank one of the
thermite-loaded pom-pom shells had found
a home with a grin of satisfaction muir
threw the telemachus helm up and over
the big ship rose clumsily on her jets

  dirk watched his cross-hair and prayed
that the lone man in the belly turret had
had time to build a field if it had been
even barely possible sims was the man
to get it done but with no handlers-

  the pirates synchros fountained deu-
trons again but this time there was no
answering crash in space the target
booms not the guns silence meant a clean
miss the cross-hair slid toward the image
of the gray cruiser dirks hand tensed
above the firing key-

  james henry stapledons voice said t
wouldnt touch that if i were you mr
phillips

  dirk froze after a moment he turned
his head slowly

  stapledon was standing in the darkness
of the open hatch smiling lazily from
behind him the dull horror of the pas-
sengers still rose and fell cradled in his
arms was dirks cyclast

the heavy sub-cruiser lay
off its guns centered watchfully on
the telemachu-s from the boarding-launch
at the liners keel airlock arrogant greedy-
eyed men with blasters filed along the
corridors and a few seconds later the
main lights came on again in the shambles
on star deck passengers looked at each
other and at what they had done some
of them wept some of them were beyond
all tears the rest were dead

  jason had to bend low to get through

-planet stories-july

ijv cygjvi	

the hatch to the bridge he was a tall
man with the mild weak face of a mom-
mas darling with him was an entity even
taller than he was a ten-foot figure with
tattered ears like a mongrel dogs a mar-
tian

  this jason said waving his hand at
the outlander is my first mate willie
peng if he gives any orders in my ab-
sence jump-or youll bloat now then
whos captain muir

  me muir said disgustedly

  oho the surly type take his shiv
willie-and you might lighten these other
heroes of their loads too

  stapledon shifted to keep the others in
line of fire while the martian blocked ja-
sons blaster the pirates eyes encoun-
tered the girl and his almost-invisible eye-
brows kinked

  my dear girl he said what a
shame

  nadya said hello paul

  dirk stared at them both paul the
raiders face was familiar-

  i see he said slowly paul haagen
no wonder you were in such a hurry to
demobilize the patrol another thought
crept unbidden into his mind there had
been another councilman who had been
strong for letting the boys go home-
kurt storm nadyas father

  im really quite sorry jason was say-
ing rather too smoothly he did not seem
to notice that dirk existed id supposed
youd be back there among the rabble
you could have been ransomed and no-
one would have been the wiser now-
now nadya said youll have to kill
me along with the officers

  stapledon stirred i say he protested
look paul theres a limit i cant con-
tinue to romanticize your exploits if you
victimize my best stars-

  be quiet jason said sharply no
i dont think ill do that nadya con-
trariwise you cant go free hmm a nice
problem the washed-out blue eyes
scanned her speculatively

  all got chief willie peng said he
threw the shivs in a corner female got
one too rf

  its ornamental no propellant cen-
taurian fashion jason said willie looked
	planet

puzzled ibut his captains indifference was
clear enough muir wheres the mail
stored 

  six paces from the nearest firing
squad muir said take a look

  i shall willie the pasenger list is
probably in that locker over there you
know the names to look for

  rf

  dirk felt his muscles cording the
locker unlike the baggage-safes below
had a tough five-tumbler electrolock on it
if willie like most outlanders was short
on patience-

  he was he fumbled tentatively and
swore in his own hoarse language then
he turned his blaster on the lock a blas-
ter in a confined space kicks up quite a
fuss-

  dirk threw himself forward with every
erg of power he could slam into his legs
stapledon shouted incoherently dirks
head butted into jasons middle

  the pirates clubbed blaster glanced
stunningly off dirks left temple the
deck hit him on the forehead he ground
his teeth and fought to his knees spitting
blood the toe of a hard-driven space-
boot crashed into his side

  on the edge of the tangle stapledon
scuttled trying to get in position to blast
dirk and still cover muir and sanders
the martians weapon would take about
eighty seconds to recharge willie threw
it at dirk and went around the other way
sanders stuck a foot out and the ten-foot
dog-man came down on the deck like a
scarecrow jason kicked dirk again and
brought the muzzle of his own blaster
into line-

   ptsiirr-tchk t

jason dropped the blaster and grabbed
at his throat blood cascaded down
the front of his jacket a half-inch of
shiv-blade protruded from his adams
apple it had nearly taken his head off
dirk retched and snatched at the weapon
on the deck but it wasnt needed as
stapledon swung on dirk muir lobbed
a balled fist as big as a grapefruit into
his ear he dropped as if stoned

  that left willie peng he had a clear

stories

field but when dirk dropped the blaster
and snatched the cyclast from the fallen
vision magnate willie laid back his ears
bared his teeth and dived under the chart
table a man will face up to a blaster or
a heat-rifle but a cyclast is something else
again nobody likes to feel his flesh run-
ning fluidly off his bones   

nice going nadya dirk gasped
the girl was crying convulsively
had to do it she sobbed when i
think what a fool he made of dad-and the
awful thing down below-

  cripes dirk said were still full
up with boarders quick sanders pull
the gas-theyve got the lights back on
and money says the same short was what
cut the gas-toggles

  the third mate jumped to the wall
toggle and pulled it it cut the alarm siren
in again but for once dirk was glad to
hear it the gas was on under the
wailing alarm he could hear it hissing be-
yond the open hatch he slammed the
hatch shut

  muir was already at the interphone
sims he roared you still free
yissir the intercom said what the
hell going on ive been sitting on my
key for twenty minutes isnt anybody
going to fire these damned guns

  muir grinned savagely keep sitting
he gestured dirk to the firing table the
single vertical cross-hair was a little to the
left of the image of the argo ii if sims
had his key down it meant that his own
horizontal cross-hair was still on the pirate
muir fired a short burst from the port
jets and the sub-cruisers image began to
drift

  when the vertical cross-hair split it
fairly across the middle dirk put down
the bridge key under the telemachus
belly the synchros screamed triumphantly

  a silent burst of white-hot gas jetted
away from the argo ivs middle dirk
held the key down as her image continued
to drift the cancer of destruction ate
its way foreward the big cruiser jerked
spasmodically but before she could get
underway the blast of deutrons reached
her bridge

  one side of the argo ii just foreward
blackout

of the overdrive assembly fell away and
a lifeship clawed spaceward muir shook
a fist at it small fry he snarled but
i hate to see a one of em stay alive-
at the nose of the telemachus a single
pom-pom spouted some crewman had
kept his head long enough to remember
his nose-filters the murder gun was com-
ing into its own the life-ship ran head-
on into a thermit shell after that it
drifted   

  as an afterthought dirk dragged wil-
lie peng out from under the chart table
and chucked him out the hatch into the
gas a sleeping prisoner he said to
no one in particular is a good prisoner
sanders said unsteadily one thing i
dont get how did stapledon get into
it

  remember his editorials last year about
peace and plenty  dirk said his chain
supported haagen and storm in the de-
mobilization campaign and he financed
jason he had every reason to want this
colonization stopped earths empire was
getting too big for him as things stood
he could sway public opinion control
council decisions get things played the
way he wanted them  but every new
star system conquered made his hold more
tenuous jason he hoped would terror-
ize the colonists ruin all chance of the
cygni system-or any other new system
-being settled by people he couldnt
manipulate

  i can see why muir said what
i want to know is how 

  thats easy stapledon was the only
person who could have bollixed up the
ships circuits that way theres a vision
set in every room his technies had
plenty of opportunity to disconnect the
gas-trips at the same time they installed
the sets and plenty of time to take out
the real glo-pups-the radioactive ones

in cygni	

that never go out - and install colored
ethons instead they were spliced onto
the regular lighting circuit when jason
wanted a blackout all his henchman had
to do was cause a short somewhere and
blooey what chance would we have of
finding where the short was in the middle
of a riot

  he felt his kicked side tenderly but
they had to have light to work by when
they boarded us they knew where the
short was and fixed it the vision tech-
nies had had no chance to disconnect the
gas toggle on the bridge and depended
on the pirates to incapacitate the bridge
when that failed they were sunk-nobody
but the patrol knows how to make gas-
proof nosepieces and jason couldnt steal
a tenth as many as hed need to equip
his crew

  its no wonder jason owned a heavy
sub-cruiser he had stapledon behind
him to put up the two million or so it
took to buy the ship from ganymede
two millions a lot of credits but they
probably got it back in the first attack-
not that the money itself interested staple-
don any he probably let jason keep it
all

  we figured that might be the story
but til now we had no proof and the
demobbing left us without enough men to
put marines aboard every ship-

  we muir said suspiciously whos
we 

  dirk grinned intelligence who else
commander john h dalton at your ser-
vice

dalton of the centrale patrol

fered was eminently satisfactory

the sun was low in the

west and a thin chill wind was blow-
ing along the hills when alfric saw
valkarion below him he reined in his
hengist and sat for a moment scouting the
terrain with the hard-learfted caution of
many wandering years

  save for himself the broad highway
that flung its time-raddled lengtli down


tonight so spake the temple
prophecy a sword-scarred out-
lander would come riding a
queen would play the tavern
bawd and the thirty-ninth dy-
nasty should fall with the mating
of the moons

virgin of

  valkarion
alfric jumped out and rushed at the threes his blade shrieking  v 
	planet

the rock slope was empty on either
hand the harsh gullied hills strteched a-
way to the dusky horizon wind whisper-
ing in gray scrub and low twisted trees
here and there evening fires glimmered red
from peasants huts or the broken columns
of temples in ruins these many thousand
years loomed against the darkening green-
ish-blue behind him the land faded to-
ward the raw naked desert from which he
liad come a falkh hovered on silent wings
far above him watching for a movement
that might mean prey-otherwise he was
alone

  still-he felt uneasy a prickling not
due to the gathering cold tingled along his
spine and he had spent too much of his
life in the nearness of death to ignore
such warnings

he looked ahead down the
great road it twisted and swooped be-
tween the fantastically wind-carven crags
a dim white ribbon in the deepening twi-
light the smooth stone blocks were crack-
ed apart by ages so long that the thought
made his head reel and in places the harsh
wiry vegetation had grown through and
over it but still the old imperial way was
there the ancients had built mightily

  halfway down the huge slope of hill-
side the road ran into valkarion city be-
low that level the cliffs dropped sharply
white with old salt-streaks to the dead
sea-bottoms- a vast depression sand and
salt and thin bitter plant-growth reaching
out to the sunset horizon

  lights were winking on in the city it
was not far and alfric had no wish to
sleep in the open or under some peasants
stinking roof so-why not go ahead the
city his goal was there and naught to
hold him from it save-

  the hengist whickered and stamped its
broad cloven hoofs its eyes rolled un-
easily and alfrics hand slid to his sword
hilt if the beast also sensed a watchful-
ness-

  he caught the stir in the thick brush-
clump out of the corner of one eye only
a hunter would have noticed it only a
rover at once without stopping to think
would have struck spurs into his mount
the hengist leaped and the dart whisper-

stories

ed past alfrics face

  one scratch from the poisoned missile
of the southern blowguns was enough to
kill a man alfric yelled and flung his
hengist at the brush the sword whined
from its scabbard flamed in his hand

  two men slipped from the thicket as he
crashed into it they were of a race for-
eign even to these southlands small and
lithe and amber-skinned they wore only
loincloths all hair had been shaved from
their heads and bodies and the iron slave-
collars were about their necks vaguely
alfric was aware of the brands on their
foreheads but at the moment he was only
concerned with their weapons

  one skipped aside raising the blowgun
to his lips alfric yanked the javelin from
its holster by his saddle and launched it
left-handed-through the slaves belly and
out his back

  steel hissed beside him as the other
swung with a scimitar the hengist scream-
ed as the blade cut its sleek gray hide
the forehoofs lashed out the great hooked
beak snapped and the slave lay a bloody
ruin on the imperial way

 alfric reined in his prancing mount and
looked around breathing hard an ambush
-by the bear of ruho theyd meant to
kill him

 but-why

  a poor solitary wanderer was no worth-
while quarry for footpads-anyway these
werent outlaws but slaves they must
have been set here with orders to destroy
some specific person but no one in val-
karion knew alfric-he was a stranger
without friend or enemy

  had they mistaken him for someone
else that would be hard to do even in
this dim light he was too plainly a bar-
barian outlander it made no sense by
luigur it made no sense

  he leaned over studying the dead men
they were secretive even in the sprawled
puppet-like helplessness of death he could
learn nothing except-hold what was
that owners brand-

  a double crescent

  the double crescent

  the knowledge shocked home like a
spear-thrust and alfric sat silent for a
long moment with the wind ruffling his
the virgin of valkarion	

night-black hair the double crescent-the
sign of the two moons-that meant the
slaves were temple property theyd been
under orders of the priesthood of the
moons which was the old imperial faith
and still the state religion of valkarion

  but if the temple sent out assassins-

alfrics eyes traveled up to am-
aris the farther moon high in the
darkening heavens the nearer one dan-
nos had not yet risen-out of the west as
was its strange wont-but its rocket-like
speed would carry it up to and beyond the
farther before dawn

  aye-aye now he remembered that to-
night the moons would mate on such
nights the temple no doubt had great cere-
monies afoot perhaps this matter of the
assassination was involved in some re-
ligious proceeding

  whispered legend and the moldering
history books alike agreed that the turn-
ing points of the old empires fate had
come on nights when the moons mated
no doubt that still held good for the with-
ered remnant of territory which valkarion
still ruled

  the moons were not important in the
religion of the aslakan barbarians whose
chief gods were the wind and the stars
and nameless powers of winter and death
but a tingle of fear ran along alfrics
spine at the thought of what might be
abroad that night

  to luigur with it his lean face twist-
ed in a snarl and he snapped sword and
javelin back in place and rode trotting on
toward valkarion come ambush or priest-
hood or the moons themselves he meant
to sleep in the city tonight

  behind him the hovering falkh wheeled
down toward the two still forms sprawled
on the highway

  the sun slipped into the dead sea-bot-
tom and night came with a silent rush
amaris rode high in a froth of stars
painting the hills with a dim eerie silver
in which monstrous shadows lurked the
wind blew stronger colder with a faint
smell of salt like the ghost of the long-
dried ocean alfric wrapped his worn
cloak tighter about him against its search-
ing chill save for the vast echoing howl

of the wind the hiss of sand and rustle of
leaves he was alone in the dark he
heard the creak and jingle of his harness
the rapid clopclop of the hengists hoofs
against a background of hooting night

   the crumbling city walls loomed darkly
before him rearing enormously against
the myraid brilliant unwinking stars he
had half expected to find the gates closed
but instead a fire blazed in the tunnel which
the gateway made through the walls a
dozen city guards stood about it

   they sprang to alertness as he rode up
a sudden wall of spears leaning forth in
front of him behind that shining steel
the light picked out helmets and corselets
and faces drawn tight with strain

  who goes called one his voice
shook a little

   a stranger but a friend said alfric
in his north-accented valkariona

   he rode into the circle of firelight and
sat in a watchful quiet as their eyes raked
him plainly he was an outland barbarian
-taller by a head than most of the south-
erners his hard-thewed body clad in the
plain leather and ring-mail of a northern
warrior his sword a double-edged clay-
more rather than the scimitar or short-
sword of the south his skin was a sun-
burned leathery brown where theirs was
tawny his long slant eyes a brilliant green
where theirs were dark and there were
jeweled rings in his pointed ears he went
cleanshaven in accordance with southern
custom but the high cheekbones thin
straight nose and long jaw were not theirs

  who are you stranger demanded
the guard captain and what is your er-
rand 

   i am alfric beodans son of aslak
he answered truthfully enough and am
simply wandering about in search of em-
ployment perhaps valkarion could use
another sword-arm or some merchant may
want a good warrior to help guard his
caravan or- he spread his calloused
hands in a general gesture no need to add
that perhaps some highwayman was in
town recruiting or some would-be rebel
was in search of an experienced war-cap-
tain who would help for the loot in his
years of adventuring alfric had held most
jobs lawful or otherwise
	planet

  the guards seemed more taut and wary
than the occasion warranted surely they
had passed stranger and more dubious visi-
tors than a single barbarian perhaps they
wanted a bribe to let him by or-

  the captain nodded stiffly you may
enter since you are alone he said and
then with a friendliness not quite natural
if you wish good cheap lodging and a
place where men come who might want to
hire a fighter try the falkh and firedrake
first turn to your right three streets
down one to your left goold luck -strang-
er

  alfric scowled for a moment he paus-
ed tensing there was something here-
to luigur with it his nerves were still
on edge from the fight if something was
supposed to happen let it

  thanks he said and rode into the
city

it was like jmost of the old im-
perial towns-somewhat larger and
busier than the rest no more on either
side of the broad paved street rose the
ancient columned facades of the empire
proud building even now when their treas-
ures were long gone and their corners
worn smooth by the winds of millennia
there were lamps lighting the main ways
their yellow glow splashing on a milling
throng of folk

  most were native valkarionas-mer-
chants in their flowing- cloaks and fur-
trimmed silken robes workers and artisans
in tunics of blue or gray peasants in
clumsy homespun garments and fur caps
swaggering young soldiers in red tun-
ics and polished metal painted harlots
ragged beggars near-naked slaves the
others of a city where life still pulsed
strong though the days of glory were more
thousands of years behind than it was
pleasant to count but there were strang-
ers-robed traders from tsungchi and
begh sarrah riding their humped dro-
mads black-skinned men of suda and as-
trak coppery feather-cloaked mercenaries
from tollaciuatl fair-haired barbarians
from valmannstad and the marskan hills
-all the world seemed met at valkarion
in a babble of tongues and a swirl of
colors

stories

  there were many of the tonsured priests
of the moons abroad in long red and
black robes with the double crescent hang-
ing from a silver chain about the neck
after each shaven-pate padded one or more
of the yellow slaves silent and watchful
hand on knife or blowgun alfric scowled
and decided he had best find lodging be-
fore venturing out into such company a
trading center like valkarion necessarily
tolerated all creeds-still someone had
tried to kill him-

  he edged out of the throng and follow-
ed the captains directions they brought
him into an unsavory part of town where
moldering blank-walled houses crowded a
winding labyrinth of narrow unlighted
streets and stinking alleys men of dubious
aspect moved furtively through the sha-
dowy maze or brawled drunkenly before
the tawdry inns and bawdy houses strange
place for a city guardsman to direct him
to-

  but no priests or soldiers were in sight
which was recommendation enough al-
fric rode on until he saw the sign of the
falhk and firedrake creaking in the chill
gusty wind above a gloomy doorway

  he dismounted and knocked one hand
on his dagger the door groaned open a
crack and a thin scar-faced man looked
out his own hand on a knife

  i want lodging for myself and my hen-
gist said alfric

  the landlords hooded eyes slid up and
down the barbarians tall form an in-
drawn breath hissed through his lips are
you from the northlands  he asked

  aye alfric flung open the door and
stepped into the taproom

  it was dim and dirty and low-ceiled a
few smoky torches throwing a guttering
light on the hard-faced men who sat at
the tables drinking the sour yellow wine
of the south they were all armed all wary
-the place was plainly a hangout of
thieves and murderers

  alfric shrugged broad shoulders hed
stayed in such places often enough how
much do you want he asked

  ah- the landlord licked his lips
nervously two chrysterces for supper
now and breakfast tomorrow one soldar
room and girl
the virgin of valkarion	

  the rate was so low that alfrics eyes
narrowed and his ears cocked forward in
an instinctive gesture of suspicion these
southerners all named several times the
price they expected to get but he had
never haggled one down as far as this
fellows asking price

  done he said at last but if the food
is bad or the bed lousy or the woman
diseased ill throw you in your own pot
and cut my breakfast off your ribs

   twill not be needful noble sir
whined the landlord he waved a thin
little slave boy over take care of the
gentlemans hengist

alfric sat down at a comer table
and ate his meal alone the food was
greasy but not bad from the shadows
he watched his fellow guests sizing up
their possibilities that big spade-bearded
fellow-he might be the head of a gang
which would find an expert sword-swinger
useful and the little wizened man in the
gray cloak might be a charlatan in need ofi
a bodyguard-

  he grew slowly aware of their own un-
ease there were too many sharp glances
thrown in his own direction entirely too
many-too much whispering behind hands
too much furtive loosening of sheathed
daggers there was something infernally
strange going on in valkarion

  alfric bristled like an angry jaccur
but throttled impatience and got up time
enough to find all that out tomorrow-he
was tired now from his long ride he
would sleep and then in the morning look
the city over

  he mounted the stairs conscious of the
glances following him and opened the
door the boy showed to him there he
paused and his hard jaw fell

  the room was just a room small lit by
one stump of candle no furniture save a
bed its window looked out on an alley
which was like a river of darkness

  it was the woman who held alfrics
eyes

  she was clad only in the usual gaudy
silken shift and she sat plucking thin
chords from the usual one-stringed harp
her rings and bracelets were ordinary
cheap gewgaws but she was no common

tavern bawd-not she

  tall and lithe and tawny-skinned she
rose to face him her shining blue-black
hair tumbled silkily to her slim waist
framing a face as finely and proudly chisel-
ed as a piece of ancient sculpture-broad
clear forehead delicately arched nose full
mobile mouth stubborn chin long smooth
throat running down toward her high firm
breasts her eyes were wide-set dark and
starry brilliant as the desert nights her
lips were like red flame

  when she spoke it was music purring
under the wind that whimpered outside
and rattled the window sash

  welcome stranger

  alfric gulped licked his lips and slowly
recovered his voice thank you my love-
ly he moved closer to her i had not-
not thought to find one like you-here
but now that you have- she came
closer and her smile blinded him-now
that you have what will you do
what do you think he laughed

  she bent over and blew out the candle

ii

alfric lost desire for
sleep the girl being as skilled in the
arts of love as she was beautiful but
later they fell to talking

  a dim shaft of moonlight streamed
through the window and etched her face
against the dark a faint mysterious rip-
pling of light and shadow and loveliness
he drew her closer kissed the smooth
cheek and murmured puzzledly who are
you why are you working in a place
like this when you could be the greatest
courtesan in the world kings would be
your slaves and armies would go to bat-
tle with your name on their lips-if they
only knew you

  she shrugged fortune does strange
things sometimes she said i am freha
and i am here because i must be her
slim fingers ruffled his harsh black hair
but tonight she breathed i am glad of
it since you came and who are you
stranger 

  i am alfric called the wanderer son
of beodan the bold son of asgar the tall
from the hills and lakes of aslak
planet stories



  and why did you leave your home
alfric

  i was restless for a bleak moment
he wondered why indeed he had ever
longed to get away from the wind-whisper-
ing trees and the cool blue hills and the small
salty sun-glinting lakes of home-from
his fathers great hall and farmstead from
the brawling lusty warriors who were his
comrades from the tall sweet girls and
joys of the hunt and feast-well it was
past now many years past

  you must have come far said freha

  far indeed over most of the world
i imagine from aslak pasture lands of
hengists to the acrid red deserts of begh
sarrah the scrub forests of astrak and
tollaciuatl the towered cities of tsungchi
-along the great canals which the ancient
empire had built in its last days still
bringing a trickle of water from the polar
nows to the starved southlands-through
ruins always ruins the crumbling sand-
filled bones of cities which had been like
jewels a hundred thousand years ago and
more-

  her cool hands passed over his face
pausing at the long dull-white scar which
slashed across his forehead and left cheek
you have fought she said how you
have fought

  aye all my life that scar- i got
it at altaris when i led the bonsonian
spears at the storming of the gates i have
been war-captain sitting beside kings and
i have been hunted outlaw with the garms
baying at my heels i have drunk the wine
of war-lords and eaten the gruel of peas-
ants and stalked my own game through the
rime-white highlands of larkin i have
pulled down cities and been flung into the
meanest jails one king put a price on my
head another wanted me to take over his
throne and a third went down the streets
before me ringing a bell and crying that
i was a god but enough alfric stirred
restlessly somehow he felt again uneasy
as if-

  freha pulled his face to hers and the
kiss lasted a long time presently she mur-
mured we have heard some rumors of
great deeds and clashing swords here in
valkarion the story of the fall of altaris
is told in the marketplaces and folk listen

till far into the night but why did you not
stay with your kings and war-lords and
captured cities xou could have been a
king yourself

  i grew weary of it he answered short-
ly

  weary-of kingly power

  why not those courts are nothing-
a barbarian ruling over one or two cities
and calling himself a king and trying
drearily to hold a court worthy of the title
the same always the same endless squab-
bling carrion birds quarreling among the
bones of the empire i went on the next
war or to see the next part of the world
and erelong i learned never to stay too
long in one place lest the newness of it
wear off

  valkarion is ever new alfric a mart
could live his life here and never see all
there was

  perhaps so they told me and it was
after all the old seat of the empire and
its shrunken remnant of territory is still
greater than any other domain so i came
here to see for myself alfric grinned
a wolfish gleam of teeth in the night also
i heard tales-restlessness a struggle for
power between temple and imperium
with the emperor an old man and the last
of his line unable to get a child on his
young queen hildaborg it seemed op-
portune

  how so he thought she breathed
faster lying there beside him

he chuckled a harsh iron sound
in his corded throat how should i
know except that when such a hells
broth is bubbling a fighting man can al-
ways scoop up loot or power or-at the
very least-adventure if nothing else
there might be the empress they say
shes a half barbarian herself a princess of
choredon and a lusty wench giving hos-
pitality to every visiting noble or knight
he felt freha stiffen a little and added
but that doesnt interest me now when
ive found you freha leave this place
with me tomorrow and youll wear the
crown jewels of valkarion

  or else see your head on a pike above
the walls she said

  faintly through the window and the
the virgin of valkarion	

whining nlght-wind they heard the crash
of a great gong

  dannos is rising whispered freha
tonight he mates with mother amaris
it is said that the fates walk through the
streets of valkarion on such nights she
shivered indeed they do on this eve
perhaps said alf ric though the hack-
les rose on his neck but how do you
know

  have you not heard her voice shud-
dered seeming to blend with the moan of
wind and steady slow boom of gong
have you not heard the emperor au-
reon is dying he is not expected to last
till dawn the thirty-ninth dynasty dies
with him and-and there is no successor
the wind mumbled under the eaves
rattling the window frame and flowing
darkly through the alley

  ha alfric laughed harshly exult-
antly a chance-by ruho what a
chance

  of a sudden he stiffened and the voice
of danger was a great shout in his head
he sat up cocking his ears and heard the
faint scratch and scrape-aye under the
window coming close-

  he slid from the covers and drew his
sword where it lay on the floor the boards
felt cold under his bare feet the night air
fingered his skin with icy hands what
is it whispered freha she sat up the
dark hair tumbling past her frightened
face what is it alfric

  he made no answer but padded over
to the window flattened against the wall
he stood waiting as a hand raised the sash
from outside

  the pale cold light of amaris fell on
the hand that now gripped the sill a body
lifted itself one-handed the other clutch-
ing a knife for an instant alfric saw the
flat hairless face in the moonlight the
double crescent brand livid against its hor-
rible blankness then in one rippling mo-
tion the slave was inside the room

  alfric thrust slicing his heart as the
man fell another swarmed up behind him
he and alfric faced each other tableau
for one instant of rivering moonlight and
whining wind and remotely beating gong
then the barbarians long arm shot out
yanked the slave in and twisted him in an

unbreakable wrestlers grip

  talk he hissed into the ear of the
writhing creature talk or ill break you
bone by bone why are you here

  he cant said freha she came up to
them white in the moonlight her long hair
blowing loose about her shoulders the
temple breeds these slaves raises them
from birth to utter fanatical obedience
and- see- she pointed to the dead man
gaping under the window

  stooping over alfric saw that he had

	tongue

the northerner shuddered
with a convulsive movement he broke
the neck of his prisoner and flung the
body aside what do they want he
panted why are they after me

  there is a prophecy-but quick there
will be others out down to the taproom-
we must have protection-

  the assassins would hardly be so stupid
as to leave us a way out grunted alfric
any down there who might help us are
probably dead or made prisoner now no
doubt these men have friends on guard
just outside the door-men wholl come
in pretty soon when these dont come
out-

  aye-that would be the way of the
temple-but where then where

  alfric flung on his kilt dagger belt and
baldric out the window he whipped
the girl to him held her supple body
against his kissed her hard and swift as
the swoop of a hunting falkh goodbye
freha you have been a wonderful
companion ill see you again-if i live
but-you cant leave me she gasped
the slaves will burst through-

  why should they harm you theyre
after me

  they will he felt her shaking against
him they will thats their way-oh
the door shuddered as a heavy weight
was flung against it thats they snarl-
ed alfric and the bolt wont hold very
long id like to stay and fight but-
come he grabbed his cloak off the floor
and buckled it across frehas slim naked
shoulders ill go first- then you jump
he balanced on the window-sill then
leaped even as he fell he wondered at
	planet

the agility of the slaves who had crawled
up the wall it was of roughset stones but
even so-

  he hit the muck and cobblestones of the
alley with the silent poise of a jaccur and
turned up to the window it was just above
the pit-black shadows a square of dark-
ness in the moon-whitened wall come
he called softly

  frehas body gleamed briefly in the
moonlight as she sprang he caught her in
his arms set her down and drew his
sword lets go he growled then sud-
denly but where will the city guards
protect us

  some might she answered shakily
but most are controlled by fear of the
temples curse best we go toward the
palace the emperors household troops
are loyal to him and hate the priesthood
which seeks to usurp his power

  we can head that way he nodded
meanwhile lookipg for a place to hide
he took her hand and they trotted through
the thick darkness toward the dim light
marking the end of the alley

  other feet padded in the gloom alfric
snarled soundlessly and pulled himself and
the girl against a wall he was almost
blind in the dark but he strained his ears
pointing them this way and that in search
of the enemy

  the others had also stopped moving
they would be waiting for him to stir
and their own motionlessness could surely
outlast the girls-anyway the pursuit
from the room would be after him in an-
other moment when the door gave way-

  run he snapped

he felt a dart blow by the spot
where he had spoken and lengthened
his frantic stride a form rose before him
vague in the night he chopped down with
his sword and felt a grim joy at the rip-
ping of flesh and sundering of bone

  now-out of the alley into a street not
much wider or lighter and down its sha-
dowy length the slaves would be behind
but-

  there was a one-story house ahead of
the usual flat-roofed construction up
gasped alfric and made a stirrup of his
hands he fairly flung the girl onto the

stories

roof she gave him a hand up bracing her
feet against the parapet and they fell
down together behind it

  alfric heard the slaves bare feet trot-
ting below him but dared not risk a glance
snakelike he and freha slithered across
the housetop only a narrow space separat-
ed them from the next they jumped that
and crossed over to another and higher
roof from this alfric peered into the
street beyond

  a couple of city guards were walking
down it spears at the ready alfric won-
dered whether he should join them-no
they would be no shield against a blow-
gun dart sent from an alley-anyway they
might be priest-loyal

  he put his mouth to frehas ear even
then aware of the dark silky hair tickling
his lips and whispered what next

  i dont know she looked ahead over
the nighted roofs to the great central
forum still ruddy-bright with torches be-
yond it the city climbed toward a double
hill on either crest of which was a build-
ing one must be the palace thought al-
fric-it was in the graceful colonnaded
style of the later empire white marble
tinder amaris nearly all its windows were
dark but he thought puzzledly that it
was surrounded by a ring of fires

  the other building was a great gray
pile sprawling its grim massiveness in a
red blaze of light from it came the steady
gong-beat and a rising chant-the temple
of the two moons holding vigil at their
wedding

  the night was huge above them a
vault of infinite crystal black in which the
stars glittered in their frosty myriads and
the milky way tumbled its bright mysteri-
ous cataract between the constellations
the pale disc of amaris rode high paint-
ing the city and the hills and the dead
sea-floor with its cold ghostly light and
now dannos was swinging rapidly out
of the west brightening the dark and cast-
ing weird double shadows that slowly
writhed with its changing position

  it was bitter chill the wind blew and
blew hooting down the streets banging
signs and driving dead leaves and sand
and bits of parchment before it alfric
shivered wishing for the rest of his clothes
the virgin of valkarion	

in the waxing moonlight he could see
sand-devils whirling on the sea-bottom a
witches dance-and on such a night trolls
and ghosts and the fates themselves
might well be abroad

  he set his teeth against chattering and
tried to fix his mind on real and desper-
ately urgent problems the priests seem-
ed able to trace us he said at least
they knew where i went for lodging best
we work toward the palace as you say
but look for a ruined house or some such
lace to hide in till morning

ill

the street below was de-

serted now they jumped down to it
and darted into the shadows on the other
side slipping along the walls of buildings
they followed its twisting length for some
time an occasional cloaked form passed
silently by otherwise there was only the
bitter wind echoing hollowly along the
tunnel-like streets

  of a sudden alfric stiffened he heard
the measured tramp of feet-a city patrol
approaching just around the next comer
whirling he led the way into an alley
black as a cave mouth it was blind but
there was a door at the end from behind
which came the twanging of harps and the
thin evil whine of desert flutes a tavern
-shelter of a sort-

  moonlight glistened on steel as the half-
dozen guardsmen passed the alley-passed
stopped and turned back they may be
here alfric heard a voice

  cursing under his breath the northerner
opened the door and stepped through into
a room barely lit by a few tapers thick
with smoke and the smell of unwashed
bodies alfrics nostrils quivered at the
heavy sweet odor of shivash and he no-
ticed the floor covered with stupefied smok-
ers a little yellow man scurried back and
forth filling the pipes at the farther end
with music and girls were wine-drinkers
ragged men of ill aspect who looked up
with hands on knives

  freha slammed the bolt down behind
them and alfric brandished his great
sword and said to them all show us a
way out

  a fist beat on the door a voice shouted
open in the name of the holy temple

  no way out gasped the landlord

  there is always an exit to these dens
snapped freha show us or we split your
skull

  a mans knife-hand moved with blur-
ring speed alfric stopped the thrown dag-
ger with his sword-blade in a clang of
steel caught it in midair and hurled it
back the man screamed as it thunked into
his belly

  out snarled the barbarian and his
glaive sang about the landlords ears

  here cried the little man running
toward the end of the room

  the door groaned as the guardsmen
hurled themselves against it

  the landlord opened a concealed trap-
door only darkness was visible below
alfric snatched a torch from the wall and
saw a tunnel of dark stone down he
rapped and freha jumped he followed
bolting the trap behind him it was of
heavy iron-the soldiers would have to
work to break through it

  the tunnel stretched hollowly away on
either side freha broke into a run and al-
fric loped beside her the torch streaming
in one hand and the sword agleam in the
other their footfalls echoed through the
cold moist dark

  what is this he asked

  old sewers-not used now when water
is scarce-a warren under the city-gasp-
ed freha

  we can hide here then he panted

  no-only the temple knows all the
passages-theyll have slaves guarding
every exit-well be trapped unless we get
out soon-

  dim sky showed ahead a hole with a
rusted iron ladder leading up into it al-
fric doused his torch and swung noise-
lessly up the rungs to peer out

  the manhole opened into one of the
ruinous abandoned districts crumbling
structures and shards of stone half buried
by the drifting sand three guardsmen
stood watching spears at the ready other-
wise there were only the moons and the
wind and the silently watching stars

  alfrics lip twisted in a snarl so-
the holes were already plugged but-
	planet

wait all egresses could not be guarded
yet best to go on in search of another-
no by the time the fugitives got there it
might be watched too here there was
as least an absence of people to interfere

he sprang out and rushed at the
three so swiftly that they were hardly
aware of him before his blade was shriek-
ing about them one man tumbled with
his head nearly sheared off another yel-
led leaping back to thrust with his spear
alfric dodged the jab grabbed the shaft in
one hand and pulled the guardsman
stumbled forward and alfrics sword rang
on his helmet he dropped stunned by
the fury of the blow

  the third was on alfric like an angry
jaccur his spear-thrust furrowed along
the barbarians ribs alfric closed in grin-
ning savagely in the cold white moonlight
and thrust with his sword the guard par-
ried the blow with his small buckler drop-
ped his spear arid drew his shortsword
bending low he rushed in probing for
alfrics guts and the northerner skipped
aside barely in time the broadsword
chopped down through the guards left
leg blood spurted the man crashed to
earth and alfric stabbed him through the
face before he could scream

  the second was climbing dizzily to his
feet alfric knocked the sword from a
nerveless hand and brought his own blade
against the guardsmans throat hold
he said one word one movement and
youll roll in the gutter with your com-
rades

  freha came up the cloak blowing about
her wondeful naked body in the wild wind
she was a fay sight under the moons and
the prisoner groaned as he saw her lady
-lady forgive-

  forgive a traitor she asked wrath
sparking in her voice

  why are the priests after me  rapped
alfric

  the guard stared surely-surely you
know-

  i know nothing speak if you want to
remain a man

  the prophecy-the priests warned us
about you that you were the heathen con-
queror of the prophecy    later they

stories

said that- the guards desperate eyes
turned to freha they said you your
majesty- his voice trailed off

  say on she snapped give me the
priests own words by dannos theyll all
swing for this i am still empress of
valkarion

  alfric looked at her in sudden shock as
if he had been clubbed empress-the em-
press of valkarion-

  but-they said you were not your ma-
jesty    the emperor is dead he died
soon after sundown-

  as soon as i was gone eh a priests
work i am thinking someone will an-
swer for that go on

  the high priest sent word over the
city he told of the prophecy-we all
knew of that but he told it anew but he
said the heathen king could still be slain
and offered a thousand gildars to the man
who did it the guard gulped then he
said you-forgive me lady you asked for
his words-he said since the dynasty was
now dead the temple would rule till fur-
ther arrangements could be made but the
empress hildaborg half barbarian idola-
trous witch-those were his words your
majesty-she lay under the temples ban
he said she was to be killed or better
captured with the heathen stranger with
whom she would probably join forces he
put the most solemn curse of the two
moons on anyone who should aid you and
the man or even fail to help hunt for
you- the guardsman sank to his knees
shaking lady forgive me i have a
family i was afraid to refuse-

  what of my household troops she
snapped

  the priests sent a detachment of the
city guards against them-a dreadful bat-
tle the household repelled the attack  but
now they are besieged in the palace-
little help there then hildaborg
laughed mirthlessly all the city against
us and our only friends bottled in a ring
of spears you chose an unlucky time to
enter valkarion alfric

  the barbarians head was spinning
you are-the empress he gasped and
theres some nonsense about me    what
is this prophecy why did you- his
voice helpless with bewilderment faded
the virgin of valkarion	

off into the moaning wind

  no time now someone may be along
any moment    where to hide where to
hide

alfrics eyes traveled down to the
two bodies sprawled on the street
suddenly he laughed a harsh metallic bark
why in the very lair of the foe he
said as good citizens it behooves us to
join the hunt for the outlaws here is
suitable clothing for us

  she nodded and fell at once to strip-
ping the corpses alfric looked arrowly
at the prisoner if you betray us- he
murmured

  i wont-by the moons i swear i
wont-

  indeed you wont said alfric and
lifted sword to cut him down

  hildaborg sprang up and grabbed his
arm thats a barbarous trick she ex-
claimed angrily you need only bind and
gag him and hide him in one of these
ruins

  why worry about the life of a guards-
man he asked contemptuously

  her dark head lifted in pride i am
empress of the guardsmen too she said

  as you like shrugged alfric

  the captive turned a face of utter wor-
ship to the woman you must secure
me he said his voice shaking but when
i am released my body and soul are yours
forever my lady

  hildaborg smiled and proceeded to cut
strips of cloth and dispose of the guard as
she had said then she turned to alfric
you are hard of heart she murmured
but perhaps valkarion needs one like you
strong and ruthless her deep eyes glow-
ed how you fought alfric how you
fought

  the barbarian squatted down and be-
gan wiping blood off the looted armor
ive had enough he growled ive been
hoodwinked and hounded over the whole
damned city ive been thrown into a broil
i never heard of and now i want some
truth what is this prophecy why are
you here what does everyone want-
he laughed humorlessly- besides our
heads 

  the prophecy-it is in the book of the

sibyl alfric it was made i know not
how many thousands or tens of thousands
of years ago at the time of the empires
greatest glory there was a half-mad
priestess who chanted songs of ruin and
desolation which few believed-what could
harm the empire but the songs were
handed down through many generations by
a few who had some faith and slowly it
was seen that the songs spoke truth- one
thing came to pass after another just as
it was foretold then the songs were col-
lected by the priesthood who use the book
to guide their policies

  hmmmm- i wonder ive no great
faith in spaedom myself

  these prophecies are true alfricnow
and again they have erred but i think
that is simply because the songs had be-
come garbled in the long time they were
handed down without much belief all too
often the future history in the book has
been written anew by times own pen
hildaborg slipped a guardsmans tunic over
her slim form her eyes were half-shut
dreaming they say the sibyl was loved
by dannos who gave her the gift of prop-
hecy and that amaris jealously decreed
she should foretell evil oftener than good
but a wise man at court who had read
much of the almost forgotten science of the
ancients told me he thought the prop-
hecies could be explained rationally he
said sometimes the mind can slip forward
along the-the world line he called it the
bodys path through a space and time that
are one space-time sometimes he said
one can remember the future he said
the sibyls mind coitld have followed the
world lines of her descendants too thus
traveling many ages ahead    but be that
as it may she spaed truly and her prop-
hecy of tonight is of-you

  the warrior shook his dark head feel-
ing a sudden eerie weight of destiny
what was the tale he whispered the
wind whipped the words from his mouth
and whirled them down the empty street

hildaborg stood while he
buckled the corselet on her and her
voice rose in a weird chant that sang
raggedly across the ruined buildings under
the stars and the two flying moons even
	planet

alfrics hardy soul was shaken by the
omnious words his hands trembling ever
so faintly as he worked

  woe woe to dannos and to amaris and
to those who serve them cry woe on val-
la arion and the world the thirty-ninth
dynasty shall end on the night when dan-
nos weds again with amaris winds shall
howl in the streets and bear away his soul
childless shall the emperor die the im-
perial line shall die with him and a strang-
er shall sit in the high throne of val-
karion

  he shall come riding alone and friend-
less riding a gray hengist into valkarion-
on the evening of that night a heathen
from the north is he a worshipper of the
zvind and the stars a storm which shall
blow out the last guttering candles of the
empire from the boundless wastes of the
desert shall he ride ruin and darkness in
his train and the last long night of the
empire will fall when he comes

  woe dannos your temple will stand in
flames when the heathen king is comei
woe mother amaris he will defile your
holy altars and break them down gods
themselves must die their dust will whirl
on the breath of his wind-god the last
blood of the empire will be swallowed by
the thirsty desert

 woe for the heathen night which
falls woe for the bitter gray dawn which
follows the moons of the empire have
set and an alien sun rides baleful over
valkarion

  there was silence after that save for
the hooting of wind and the thin dry
whisper of blowing sand dannos swung
higher a pale cold eye in  the frosty
heavens alfric clamped his teeth together
and finished the disguise

  the armor and clothing were strained
on his tall form ill-fitting but with the
cloak draped over and the helmet shadow-
ing his face he should pass muster under
the cloak across his back he had his
broadsword--these short southern stabbers
were no good

  hildaborg was better fitted slim and
boyish in the shining steel her long hair
tucked under the crested helm spear car-
ried proudly erect she seemed a young
goodess of war alfric thought dizzily

stories

that no such woman had fever grossed
even his dreams

  he hid the corpses in the ruins and they
started down the street together well
try to work through the line of siege in-
to the palace he said once were with
your troops something may still be done
i doubt it they are brave men but
few-few her voice was bitter

  if we can- alfric sank into thought
for a while then suddenly he said now
i know why the priests are after me but
what of you where do you come into
this picture

  i knew about the prophecy she re-
plied also i knew what my fate was
likely to be when aureon died the temple
and the imperium ostensibly the two pil-
lars of the empire have long been strug-
gling for power each side has its war-
riors and spies its adherents among the
nobles and commons-oh the last several
generations have been a weary tale of in-
trigue murder corruption with first one
side and now another on top the temple
wants a figurehead emperor the im-
perium wants a subservient priesthood-
well you know the story

  aye a sorry one it should be ende
with the sword wipe both miserable fac-
tions out and start anew

he looked curiously at him so
the sibyl was not wrong she mur-
mured the heathen come out of the
north with destruction alike for the em-
pire and the gods

  luigur take it i dont care about val-
karion not even enough to destroy it
i only want to save my own neck his
hand stroked her arm softly and yours
but go on

  the thirty-ninth dynasty was the last
family with any pretensions to even a trace
of the legendary imperial blood the line
of dannos himself and aureon was the
last of them-his sons slain in war him-
self an old man without relatives the im-
perial line had been weakening and dying
for generations-inbred enfebbled degen-
erate the blood of dannos running thinner
in each new birth aureon had sense
enough to take a second wife of different
stock-myself princess of choredon
the virgin of valkarion	

thereby he gained a valuable ally for val-
karion-but ho children and now he is
dead hildaborg sighed so the imper-
ium is gone the temple is the sole power
and a strong and unscrupling high priest
rules valkarion i think the priest the-
rokos intends to proclaim valkarion a
theocarcy with himself as the head but
first for reasons of politics and personal
hatred he must get rid of me

  why should he hate you

  hildaborg smiled twistedly he dis-
approves of barbarians and my mother
was from valmannstad he disapproves of
my laxness in religious matters he knows
i stand between him and absolute power
i gave aureon strength to oppose him and
thwarted many of his measures the com-
mons think well of me i have done what
i could to improve their lot and he hates
any hold on valkarions soul other than
his own

-	i knew that with aureon dead and no
heir of the blood therokos would feel
free to strike i could not hope to match
him for long especially since the law is
that no woman may rule in valkarion my
one chance seemed to lie in the new con-
queror who was to come yet i could not
approach him openly-the temple spies
were everywhere and anyway the prop-
hecy was that he would be a destroying
fury worse perhaps than the priests i had
to sound him out first and secretly

  so i put a trustworthy guards-captain
in charge of the gate today with instruc-
tions to direct the stranger to the falkh
and firedrake the landlord there was
paid to make sure you would stay and
would take the room where i was in my
guise of tavern girl

  so you came but now it seems the
priests were ware to my plan they have
acted swifter than i thought striking in-
stantly at my men-i expected at least a
few days of truce and i played into their
hands by thus cutting myself off from all
help now they need only hunt us down
and kill us

   twill take some doing growled al-
fric ha we may yet pull their cursed
temple down about their shaven skulls
and so the prophecy would be fulfilled

-planet stories-july

-you would blow out the last dim flicker
of light- she stopped staring at him
and her voice came slowly valkarion
the last citadel of civilization the last hope
of the dying world to be wasted by a
heathen bandit-perhaps the priests are
right alfric of aslak perhaps you should
die

  luigur take your damned prophecy
he snarled

they stood tautly facing each
other in the thin chill moonlight the
wind blew and blew whining between the
empty ruins of houses blowing the dust
of their erosion along the empty street

  i know your old imperial towns said
alfric savagely ive seen them molder-
ing shells half the place deserted because
the population has shrunk so far-wearily
dreaming of a dead past grubbing up the
old works and sitting with noses buried in
the old books while robbers howl in the
deserts and thieving politicians loot the
treasury year by year the towns crumble
bridges fall canals dry up people grow
fewer-and nobody cares a world is blow-
ing away in red dust and nobody stirs to
help by the winds of ruho its about
time someone pulled down that tottering
wreck you call imperial civilization its
about time we forgot the past and started
thinking-and doing-something about the
present the man who burns valkarion
will be doing the world a service
silence under the wind and the stars
and the two moons marching toward their
union hildaborg hefted her spear until
the point gleamed near alfrics throat

  he sneered out of bitterness and des-
pair and a sudden longing for her lips
dont try to stick me with that toy you
saw what happened to the guards

  and you would kill me her voice
was all at once desolate she dropped the
spearhead to the ground

  no but i would leave you-no by
the holy well i wouldnt but id leave
the damned city he stepped forward
laying his hands on her mailed shoulders
and his voice rang with sudden earnest-
ness hildaborg that is your answer no
need to stay in this place of death we can
steal hengists and bluff our way past the
	planet

gates and be in the hills ere dawn if you
fear for valkarion at my hands leave it
-leave it to rot and come with me

  come-where 

  home back to aslak back to the blue
hills and the windy trees and the little lakes
dancing in the sun-to an open heaven
and a wide land and free folk who look
you honestly in the eye luigur take the
empire as he will whatever we do he
laughed a joyous sound echoing in the
night well build our own stead and live
as freefolk and raise a dozen tall sons
hildaborg lets go

  for a moment she stood silent when
she spoke her voice trembled a little and
the moonlight glinted off tears in her eyes

  i love you for it alfric and gladly
would go but therokos is besieging the
palace-he is gathering in all who ever
spoke well of me    shall my friends be
hanged and burned and hacked to bits
and i safe in aslak

  youre a fool what could you do for
them

  die but this is no quarrel of yours
alfric if you wish go and i shall not
think of the less of you go-my dear-
est-

  he laughed again and kissed-her for a
very long moment you are a fool and a
madwoman and i love you for that he
said come-we can still show these
priests the color of steel

iv

hey trotted rapidly
along the ways their mail clanking
erelong they were out of the deserted dis-
trict and approaching the central forum

  it seethed with people all valkarion
seemed to be out tonight moving slowly
aimlessly under the compulsion of a
nameless fear the town buzzed with
voices low secretive and the shuffle of
thousands of feet under the lamps and the
bobbing torches high over the muted
tumult blown on the harrying wind chant
and gong-beat came from the temple

  alfric and hildaborg pushed their way
through the milling murmuring tide the
unease the rising wave of fear was like
a tangible force the northerners skin

stories

prickled with it eyes thousands of eyes
shifting and staring out of pale faces-
the city was full of eyes

  he heard a voice as he came to the edge
of the great plaza thrusting forward the
tall barbarian looked over the heads of
the crowd there was a rostrum surround-
ed by a tight ring of temple guards and
from atop it a robed priest was harangu-
ing the throng

  -the dynasty is dead and the wrath
of the moons lies heavy over valkarion
woe to the world for the heathen fiend
the scourge of dannos is loose

  yet i bring hope-aye from all-merci-
ful mother amaris i bring cheer in this
darkest hour there is time still time to seize
the barbarian ere his power grows there
is still time too to seize and disown the
half-caste witch hildaborg there is time
to submit to the wise rule of the temple
that the high priest may intercede with
all-father dannos repent and be for-
given-destroy the evilworkers who
brought this trouble on you and the mat-
ing of the moons will yet bring forth a
new birth of hope

  alfric grew aware of the muttering
about him-the commons of valkarion
laborer artisan merchant peasant turn-
ing thought over and growling it to his
neighbor

  -an ill choice to see the city ruined or
bow to the shavepates

  i am afraid the moons are high and
bitter bright now they are looking down
on us i am afraid

  twas hildaborg who lowered the tax-
es twas hildaborg and not dotard au-
reon or thieving therokos who whipped
the army into shape and beat off the
savonnian invaders what has the temple
ever done for us save milk us for our
tithes and frighten our babes with stories
of godly wrath 

hush the moons are watching
hildaborg is beautiful she is like a
goddess as she rides through the streets
and smiles on us amaris herself is not
more beautiful

  the temple is holy

  the priests burned my brother for
sorcery he had one of the old books
that is all he tried to build the machine it
the virgin of valkarion



told of-and they burned him

  they have enough old books them-
selves they sit on all the wisdom of the
ancients and none of us can so much as
read

  the fates are abroad tonight i am
afraid

  my son is in the household theyre
after his skin-hell hang if he isnt dead
already-unless-

  aye my son is in the city guards
they told him to go hunt down the strang-
er and the empress-the empress-and
off he went a grim chuckle but 
think he is sitting quietly in some corner
waiting

  there is an old battle ax at home my
grandfather bore it in the rurian war i
think i could still swing it if need be

  i am afraid-

alfric smiled a steely grimace
in the shadow of his visor and led
the way onward

  but he was not to pass easily he thrust
aside a burly peasant who turned on him
with a snarl mind your manners
guardsman ist not enough you should
be traitor to the empress

  aye the city guards have sat about
drinking and gaming and making the
streets unsafe for our daughters said an-
other man harshly they didnt get off
their fat butts till this chance came to go
yapping after hildaborg

  alfric tried to shoulder past the ring of
angry folk who gathered aside he
called aside or i use my spear
mind your manners guardsman grin-
ned the peasant he came closer and al-
fric smelled the wine on his breath what
say we have a little fun with these priest-
lovers comrades will they squeal when
we pummel em

  alfrics fist shot out like a ball of iron
there was a dull smack and the pleasant
flew back against the man behind the
barbarian flailed out with his spear butt
and the crowd gave way

  through he muttered to hildaborg
quick we have to get away

  theyre our friends she whispered
frantically cant we reveal-

  and bring the guard down on this

unarmed mob we wouldnt last a mo-
ment come

  a stone clanged against the girls hel-
met she staggered half collapsing into
alfrics arms the crowd growled beast-
like and shoved in closer

  aside shouted alfric make way
or the curse of the moons is on you
you talk like a priest said a laborer
thickly he lifted a heavy billet of wood
on them boys kill them

  alfric laid the half-stunned girl on the
ground stood over her and drew his
broadsword an outlander shouted
someone back in the sea of shadowy
torch-lit hating faces a mercenary hunt-
ing our empress

  the mob surged against him he thrust
around with the sword striking to disable
but not to kill-though hed slay if he had
to he thought desperately

  stones were flying one hit him on the
cheek pain knifed through his head hai
ruho he roared and banged a skull the
mob edged away a little eyes and teeth
gleamed white in the bloody torchlight

  a trumpet-blast sounded harsh and ar-
rogant over the rising voices someone
screamed alfric saw spears aloft steel
gleaming red-a squad of guardsmen to
the rescue

  the rescue he groaned lifted hilda-
borg and sought to retreat through the
crowd

  too late the guards were hacking a
bloody way through the mob it scat-
tered in panic and the squad was there

  just in time panted its chief the
folk are ugly theyve killed a dozen
guardsmen already to my knowledge a
couple of priests i dont know how many
temple slaves-dannos smite the blas-
phemers 

  thanks alfric set the reviving girl
on her feet now i have to go-special
mission urgent-

  the chief looked sharply at him you
have a barbarous accent he said slowly
and youre no valkariona who-
hildaborg groaned stirring back to co-
sciousness alfric-

  a boy- no- the officer stepped
forth hildaborgs lovely face turned to-
ward the light and he gasped sht-
	planet

alfric picked up his spear and
hurled it through the chiefs throat
then he lifted his dripping sword and
stood by hildaborg waiting for the end

  the empress-the empress and the
heathen-weve found them-

  the crowd had withdrawn milling
around the edges of the forum too fright-
ened and confused to help the priest and
his guards were coming on the double
yelling for help other armed men seemed
to be springing from the ground

  alivei shrilled the priest take
them alive if you can a thousand gil-
darsi

  the guards were well disciplined they
locked shields in a ring about alfric and
closed in man for man he could have
laughed at them-but this way-

  hildaborg swayed on her feet beside
him so this is the end she whispered
i love you alfric-

  he howled a his rage and sprang for-
ward the sword blurred in his hands
ringing on shields and helmets a guard
fell shrieking his right arm sheared off
alfric stabbed another in the neck kicked
a third in the groin and roared

  they surged around him hemming him
in with their shields clubbed spears thud-
ded against his helmet and it rang like
a brazen gong he staggered shouted
struck out again-the sword fell from his
hands-he toppled into a clamoring dark-
ness-

  dimly he was aware of being stripped
of armor chained hand and foot hauled
roughly to his feet he lurched mechani-
cally along and slowly his head cleared
through a mist of throbbing pain he saw
that hildaborg walked beside him spears
pricked their backs the chains rattled on
ankles and wrists they were in the mid-
dle of a tight triple ring of guards march-
ing up the hill toward the temple

  the villas of the mighty lay around them
white in the moonlight fragrant with gar-
dens alfric saw fountains splashing and
even then thought of the parched land be-
yond the walls land that might flower
again if it had that water

  but that would never be he would
swing high above the city the falkhs would
pick out his eyes-hildaborg would die and

stories

the grip of the temple would be locked
on valkarion till its last stones were dust
on the wind

  strength came back a bleak resolve not
to go down without one more fight his
brain began whirring the old cold crafti-
ness of his turbulent lifetime surged for-
ward    hopeless they were caught they
were done all his struggles were the vain
writhings of a beast in a cage

  so this ends it hildaborgs voice
was weary then she smiled a little but
we made a good try alfric and warmly
and we have loved each other that is
enough

  it is not he answered but it is
something

  silence commanded the priest

  now they were on the hillcrest the
mighty walls of the temple looming be-
fore them alfric saw it aswarm with
slaves and guards and priests of all de-
grees the gong-beat was a steady tre-
mendous crashing-it seemed to fill the
world with its brazen clamor high rose
the chant of the moon wedding

  the warrior glanced aside over to the
palace there was a bridge spanning the
gully between the two hillcrests and guards
were on it other guards city and temple
were besieging the palace he saw their
fires in a ring about it they were setting
up a great ballista whose stones he knew
would bring the walls down in ruin

  from the hilltop he could see over the
moon-whitened desert and the vast reach
of the old sea-bottom once it had been
blue and alive glittering with sunlight
the long waves rolling in to crash in foam
and thunder on a dazzling beach the
harbor of valkarion had been crowded
with ships from all the world a forest of
tall masts a wild perfumery of salt and
tar and the spices of the south and be-
yond the land had been green and white
clouds had sailed through a soft blue sum-
mer sky

well it was gone-the world
was dried into desert and scrubby
forest and harsh meadowland sand blew
in the ancient beds of rivers and seas the
air was thin and chill and held a bitter
tang of rust the cities were in ruins the
the virgin of

empire was a shadow and man was gone
back to a few wretched remnants sinking
into barbarism and death

  alfric looked up to the cold splendid
night sky there was a tradition from the
wise ancients he had once been told that
those swarming bright star-hosts were
other worlds and suns happier maybe
than this it was some consolation

  the moons were near their mating now
bright dannos was sweeping triumphantly
down on pale mother amaris he would
cover her and then pass on and out of
that wedding would come the fate of the
world cold fate dark destiny-night and
famine and death the moons hurtling over
a world sunk into final oblivion

  well men died sometime or other and
all they could do about it was to meet the
end bravely alfric squared his shoulders
and marched into the temple

  there was a long corridor at the end
of which he saw a vast room flashing in
gold and silver and fiery jewels draped
with the costliest ancient tapestries even
then alfrics eyes gleamed greenly to
loot that room

  they turned off along another hall and
then down a stone-cut flight of steps into
the temple dungeons alfric had been in
enough jails before not to find the damp
rough-hewn rock tunnels strange but
hildaborg shuddered and pressed closer
to him

  a scream echoed down the corridor rose
and fell and died raggedly into the echoes

the priest smirked a heretic is being
shown the error of his ways he said
unctuously he blasphemed against the
moons and swore he would abide by the
empress

  then the gods abide by him said
hildaborg defiantly

  the guards thrust them into a cell little
more than a cave chipped out of the hills
heart and locked their chains to staples
in the walls they were held barely able
to move facing each other with a few scant
inches between-miles between a world
between thought alfric wearily-he would
never kiss her again-

  the guards clanged the door shut and
left them in utter darkness hildaborgs
voice trembled but she spoke bravey

what can we do

  nothing now the barbarian strained
against his chains felt their solidity and
relaxed wait for a chance maybe other-
wise-die

  i dont want to die alfric i want to
live i want to see the sky and feel the
wind and bear your sons

  i dont enjoy the thought of death ei-
ther dearest if we had fled to aslak-
but we didnt and for myself i am
still glad though that you should die
too- her voice broke and he heard her
quiet sobbing in the dark

  he tried to find words but they were
awkward so he fell into silence

  presently the door opened again a man
came in with only two torch-bearing
temple slaves accompaning alfric look-
ed at his magnificent robes and knew him
for therokos the high priest

he was tall stoop-shouldered a
little on che fat side but well mus-
cled underneath his face was wide and
heavy sallow under the high shaven fore-
head the mouth hard and thin the eyes
small and black and glittering-cold when
he spoke his voice was wondrous a deep
organ which he played like a master musi-
cian

  so we meet again your majesty he
said and bowed there was little mockery
in his tones he seemed straightforward
and businesslike

  hildaborg did not answer she stood
with her beautous form in its ragged
soldiers tunic pressed against the wall
her sweat-dampened black hair clung to
her forehead fell down her shoulders in a
shining wave in the restless torchlight
her face was white and drawn streaked
with blood and dirt and the tracks of tears
but she gave the high priest glance for
glance and her lips were steady

  therokos looked alfrics tall form up
and down and so you are the conqueror
of the prophecy he murmured a mighty
man-but just how did you think you
could do it who are your allies in the
city what was your plan

  i am alfric of aslak and i came here
without friends or plan knowing nothing
of any prophecy answered the barbarian

coldly and you are a misbegotten son of
a she-garm with whose head i will yet
play football

  come now said therokos softly sure-
ly you do not expect me to believe you
are here by mere chance your cause is
lost you are doomed but you can save
yourself the inquisition and die easily if
if you will tell us what you know

  i know nothing you jerrad

  you may know more after the inquisi-
tioners have worked on you awhile said
therokos coldly then turning to hilda-
borg his voice suddenly rich and warm
throbbing with love and pity my lady
my lady you do not know how i regret
this that the empress of valkarion
should even for dire necessity be thus
humiliated in the greatest sorrow of my
life

  hildaborgs lip curled i see you weep-
ing she said coldly

  but i do my lady-my heart is ashes
within me only need drove me to this
-and it is not yet too late to repent your
majesty what the moons have taken the
moons can restore

  surely my lady said therokos rea-
sonably you can see the absolute necessity
of my actions under the law you could
not rule and there was no imperial heir
without a strong hand leaderless val-
karion would have split under the quarrel-
ing of the nobles and the lawlessness of the
commons easy prey for barbarian enemies
such as this man-and the sibyls warning
would have come true with the imperium
gone the temple sole remaining pillar
of valkarion must bear the burden oj
state

  in other words said hildaborg coldly
you will have yourself annointed theo-
crat

  the moons have seen fit thus to honor
my unworthiness said therokos but
it would still be well if we should unite
our forces you have many loyal friends
my lady myself not the least of them if
you will but wed me we can together unite
the factions in the city and build the em-
pire anew

  she smiled almost a sneer yours was
a strange courtship

  i have told you how the necessity
the virgin of valkarion

grieved me said the priest suddenly his
voice came hard as steel cold as winter
and death it is now my duty to offer
you a choice call on your troops to sur-
render your followers in the city to de-
sist from their treasonous activities and
wed me this night or- he paused-
burn at the stake for blasphemy and
witchcraft but first you will be tied down
and every slave in the temple have his
way with you

  that might not be worse than leading
my men into your hands she flared but
her face was suddenly bloodless

  you will be surprised how much worse
it will be-especially since your men will
die anyway but i will offer you this too
if you call on them to surrender those
who do may go into exile

  she stood a moment in silence and al-
fric knew what a horror must be clawing
her heart then she nodded toward him
what of my protector here

  the heathen bandit must die in any
case that the city may know itself safe
from him and the prophecy said thero-
kos he still has his choice of easy hang-
ing or slow torture but if yqu refuse me
hildaborg he will no longer have the
choice he wrll go to hell by inches cursing
you for it

  the lovely dark head bowed it was as
if a flame had gone out alfric felt ill
at seeing her thus broken given over to a
lifetimes prisoning-golden chains they
would be but no less heavy and galling
goodbye my dear he whispered good-
bye i will always love you

  she made no reply but said to thero-
kos tonelessly i yield me lord

v

the high priests face lit

and alfric realized dully that the-
rokos too loved the queen-in his own
cold way you do well beautiful one
he said shakily he came over and kissed
her and fondled her stiff body you have
never done better black witch now come
-to your wedding

  he signed to the two slaves who sconc-
ed their torches and took a key from their
master they unlocked hildaborgs chains

and she almost fell into therokos arras

  he caressed her murmuring softly
there dear easy-you will wash and eat
and rest you will wear the robes of honor
-be at ease you are safe now you are
mine forever

  aye- she braced herself every mus-
cle tautened under the silken skin and
suddenly she hurled the priest from her-
sent him staggering against alfric killi
she screamed

  the barbarian snarled wild with a sud-
den murderous glory and his manacled
hands shot out one gripped therokos
over the mouth and the other sank steely
fingers into the wattled throat

  the two slaves sprang at him like wild
garms knives flashed in the bloody light
hildaborg snatched a torch and swept its
flaming end across the eyes of one he
screamed wordlessly rolling over and over
clawing at his face hildaborg snatched up
his dagger and lunged at the other

  alfric groaned what chance did she
have against the deadly experience of a
temple assassin-therokos had gone
limp alfric flung the heavy body crashing
into the slave they went down together
hildaborg leaped in her knife rising and
falling and risingagain streaming red

  then she was in his arms shaken by
wild sobbing he held her close kissed
her stroked her hair and had time for a
dim wondering amazement that such a
woman should have lain in his-his-fate

  there was no time to lose unlock me
he said unlock me and lets get out of
this den of luigur

  she searched therkos robes for the
key found it and cast the chains rattling
aside alfric snatched up a knife with an
uneasy glance at the door but the noise
had drawn no guards they must be used
to screams in this part of the temple

  therokos stirred groaning alfrics big
brown form stooped over him dagger
against throat up with you fat jerrad
hissed the northerner up and not a
word or youll be spilling guts over the
floor

  the high priest climbed unsteadily to
his feet now lead us out by a secret
way rasped alfric

  there is none- groaned therokos

  alfric slapped him with savage fury
shut up i know there is you priests are
like all burrowing snakes youve more
than one exit to your holes march and
if we meet guards youll die first
therokos flung him a glance of utter
hate but stumbled obediently ahead the
empty corridor echoed dully to their foot-
falls near its end therokos pressed a
camouflaged stud and a section of the
rock wall swung aside on noiseless hinges

  hildaborg took a torch from the wall
and closed the door behind them they
went down a long sloping tunnel so low
that alfric had to stoop you cannot hope
to escape said therokos his voice again
under his wondrous control best you give
up peaceably saving trouble and lives on
both sides in exchange i will offer bet-
ter terms than before

  what asked alfric skeptically
weapons money and hengists-theil
you can leave the city for the hell that
awaits you

  and my men insisted hildaborg
  exile with you

lfric pondered the proposal
if they could get free with men at
their back they could always raise an army
for a new attempt but surely therokos
was aware of that so if he had some trick
-and it would be strange if he did not--
how do we know youll keep the bar-
gain  he asked coldly

  you have the honor of the high
priest answered therokos loftily alfric
sneered and therokos added also i as-
sume you keep me prisoner until you are
safe

  it does not sound ill- mused hilda-
borg 	

  nor did it to alfric but he shook his
head stubbornly i mistrust him more-
over a new war after he had time to get
ready would take time and lives and
might fail if tonight is indeed the night
of destiny we can still strike

  with what jerred therokos

  alfric was not quite sure himself but
prodded the captive ungently onward
they came to another hinged rock and
therokos opened that door for them al-
frics spine crawled with the thought of
the virgin of

what might he beyond he kept the dag-
ger against therokos back as they step-
ped out

  they were in the shadows of a ruined
portico in a deserted section near the bot-
tom of the hill white and serene the
ancient columns lifted toward the two
moons the gracious remnants of elder
days stretched on either side half buried
jy drifting sand black against the sky the
temple loomed on the hillcrest but alfric
saw no movement

  hildaborg slipped against him now
what shall we do  she whispered

   he laughed softly the old grim battle
joy flowing up in him weariness and
despair fell off like an outworn cloak-
there was new strength in his thews and a
goal in his mind

  i heard down there how valkarion
really hates the priests he said the city
is seething with revolt which wants only a
leader could the common folk rise i think
nigh all the city guards impressed into
priest service by fear would come over
to their side and you-they love you
hildaborg could you go to sure friends 
aye-there is old bronnes the mer-
chant and captain hassalon of the guard
and-many

   then go slip down to them give them
word and tell them to pass it on to shout
it over the city you the empress the
divinely appointed lady of valkarion tell
the folk to rise against the temple let
them storm the citadel and they may have
the looting of it he chuckled that
should bring in the laggards

  but-untrained mobs against the
guards-

   there will be other guardsmen on your
side and-this is my part-your house-
hold will also be there

  but-theyre besieged-

   ill get them out alfric stripped off
therokos gold-braided cloak and slung it
over her shoulders this will cover you
well enough so you can get to your friends
unharmed now go hildaborg and ruho
go with you

   he kissed her with a wild hunger that
dissolved into tenderness stay out of
danger he whispered stay in a safe
place till i come for you-hildaborg-

  therokos scuttled aside oh no snarl-
ed alfric and stabbed the priest tumbled
with blood rivering from his stomach
choking his screams alfric took hildaborg
again in his arms goodbye my dearest
dear-

  she slipped into the shadows alfric
sighed wondering with a brief heaviness
if he would ever see her again he knew
full well how desperate his gamble was

  well there was work to be done he
turned and ran crouched along the hillside
weaving in and out of darkness the
moons were almost at their mating now
flooding the city with chill silver radi-
ance

  he grinned up at them and what did
they think of this ruination of their an-
cient godhead he could hardly imagine
them caring about it surely dannos the
swift warrior and bright mother amaris
had more use for an honest fighting man
and his warm-hearted love than for a
bunch of sniveling shavepates all honor
to the moons but not to tyrants and mur-
derers in their name

  he was in the gully now between tem-
ple and palace snakelike he crawled un-
der the shadow of the bridge to its farther
end where he peered cautionsly around
an abutment

  the trampled gardens were full of city
and temple guards whose watchfires ring-
ed the palace he saw the light agleam
on spears and swords and armor and had
time to wonder if he would ever make it
past them

  but he had to try he drew a deep
breath tightened his muscles - and ran

like a flying arrow he ran
noiseless on bare feet and none saw
him before he was hugged against a low
thorn-tree near one of the fires up it he
went wincing as the thorns raked him
and slipped along a branch almost over-
hanging the blaze

  he caught a snatch of muttered con-
versation -when they finish those siege
engines down the palace goes but the
household will be out like a swam of
stinger asts i dont relish fighting the
best swords in valkarion

  no but we outnumber them

stories

  my cousin is in there i hate to think
of-

  alfric sprang he soared from his perch
and crashed into the chest of the man he
had picked the guard went down in a
clang of armor and dry snap of breaking
ribs alfric snatched his spear and jafibed
it through the groin of another through
that gap then he raced low and zigzag
among the bushes

  the siege line roared the air was sud-
denly thick with spears and arrows al-
fric felt one rake his leg and cursed be-
tween gasps to the palace

  open he howled open let me by
in the name of the empress

  if the garrison took this for a ruse and
shot him it was all over he plunged up
the long staircase past the crouching cra-
ven sphinxes of the empire the doors
had been broken down in the first assault
but the imperials had put up a barricade
he saw steel flash as he neared it

  hildaborg he bawled live the em-
press 

  they held their fire he fell under the
barricade while their arrows hummed over-
head the disorderly temple pursuit broke
into retreat back out of bowshot

  alfric climbed over the barricade into
the great palace ante-chamber its golden
glory was gutted by fighting splashed
with dry blood the tapestries in rags and
the furniture splintered dead men and
wounded lay side by side against the walls
under the ancient murals of the empires
greatness a dozen tall cuirassiers in gold
and purple uniforms-now torn and blood-
stained-stood waiting for him their
spears and swords axes and bows were
at the ready their haggard faces bleak
with suspicion

  who are you  demanded the captain
what is this

  i am alfric of aslak- panted the
newcomer

  a barbarian-the barbarian- the out-
lander of the prophecy- they hefted
their weapons eyes narrowing mouths
drawing into taut lines

  i am with hildaborg against the tem-
ple said alfric twas with my help she
escaped their net now she leads all of
us to overthrow her foes
the virgin of valkarion



  how do we know you speak truth
snapped the captain

  youll know it when i lead you out
against the temple

  out-to be cut down by thrice our
number  go to

  theyll have more to worry about than
us said alfric in hard brief words he
told them the plan

   at the end of it the tall captain clap-
ped his shoulder and said in a voice sud-
denly warm that is a tale whose truth
we can see for ourselves when the em-
press folk come up against the temple
so ill believe it for one i am ganimos
of the imperial household welcome al-
fric of aslak 

  the barbarian nodded too weary for
speechmaking give me some water and
wine and a little to eat he said ill
wash refresh myself and be ready to go
with you at the time of the uprising if we
hit the temple from the side then it will
fall

  but he had scarcely gotten clean don-
ned a guardsmans armor and stretched
himself on a couch for a moments nap
when he heard the blare of trumpets
ganimos burst into the room where he
lay shouting the temples men are
storming us again in full force and no
help from the city in sight up-up and
die

vi

alfric swung to his feet

suddenly raging therokos i he
growled i thought the devil was left dy-
ing but someone must have found him
he knows the plan means to thwart it by
taking us before hildaborgs force can be
raised without us to attack from the
flank the temple may well drive off her
assault

  ganimos fingered hi shortsword with
an ominous side glance unless this be
some treachery of yours barbarian- he
murmured

  what difference has my coming made
in your actions so far snapped alfric

come here to fight on your side when they
attacked

  aye-truth truth but come gani-
mos smiled twistedly if this is your night
of destiny as they say alfric the fates
have their work cut out for them

  a roar of battle rose as they came out
into the antechamber ganimos groaned
there are too many ways into this damn-
ed building-we have to guard them all
and we lost a quarter of our men the first
time if the temple men assault one point
in strength theyll be inside

  let them blazed alfric his eyes
were like green fire under the swaying cry-
stal candelabra send messengers to all
entrances ganimos-tell the men there to
retreat firing the palace to hinder pur-
suit well gather all our forces here-
burn the palace  cried the guardsman
i swore to defend it

 you swore to defend the imperial
family too didnt you if we cant get
outside to help the empress youll be a
hell of a use to her now go

  there was no gainsaying the wild power
which blazed in the northerner ganimos
went shouting alfric swung joyously to
the barricade lifting the battle ax he had
taken in preference to a shortsword

  the archers and spearmen were sending
forth a deadly hail but theycould not halt
the enemy charge alfric saw that there
was cavalry coming against the main en-
trance with foot soldiers behind if they
got over or through the flimsy barrier-
spears he roared spearmen hold
firm

  he led the way to the barricade top
and ranked his guardsmen-they were his
now he was again master of war and equal
of kings-in a tight line with spears
braced outward now hold he shouted
hold for the sake of ruho

  the hengists thundered up the stairs
across the portico against and up the
sides of the barricade in a living wave
for a moment battle raged the heap of
wood and stone chunks broke some of the
speed of the charge but still it shocked
against the spear line with a fury that
trembled in the walls metal clanged men
shouted hengists screamed in a boiling
tide of struggle alfric saw a spearman
fall spitted on a lance he snatched the
shaft and thrust it into the throat of the

stoiues

hengist breaking through-with all his
straining force he rammed it home and
steed and rider tumbled back

  the cavalry broke hengists bucking
refusing to hit that gleaming line again
the temple infantry line scattered as the
maddened animals trampled into it house-
holders were streaming into the antecham-
ber and alfrics nostrils quivered to the
first acrid whiffs of smoke with a burn-
ing palace behind them the imperials need
have less fear of an attack from the rear

  the infantry will be up against us in a
moment panted ganimos

  aye wed better charge out while
theyre still disorganized said alfric
well assault the temple itself and pray
your moons help comes ere were cut
down

  well die like men anyway said
ganimos not like beasts in a trap thank
you for that stranger

  then-hai hildaborg alfric plunged
over the barricade

  the household guards followed a wave
that formed into a wedge and plunged
across the gardens the finest warriors of
valkarion hit the wavering temple forces
like a spear going home

ax and sword spear and arrow
clang and roar of metal whirring
weapons rushing blood-shouts and cur-
ses screams deep-throated oaths-death
unchained in the gardens of valkarion

  alfric led the way at the point of the
wedge smiting smiting no man could
stand before his raging fury-his ax was
a dazzle and thunder before him hewing
hewing he led the household forth

  hildaborg hai hildaborg the war
cry shouted over the hills rang in echoes
with the clamor of metal and shock of
combat hildaborg

  these householders fought like de-
mons thought alfric dimly as he struck
at the faces and bodies which loomed
briefly out of night and shadow into the
red dance of fire how they fought  but
-ruho if he only had a levy of aslakan
axmen behind him now

  they won through to the bridge-
through and over in a dash that drove the
few guards before it like dry leaves be-
the virgin of valkarion

m

fore a gale alfric turned gasping to
ganimos hold the bridge he said as
soon as were all over hold the bridge
thatll protect our rear from cavalry-
hengists cant go through that steep gully
and when the foot soldiers have gathered
enough wits to come after us that way you
can throw spears down on top of them

  aye your majesty the title came
without thought to the soldiers lips as he
saluted and turned to hail a squad to stay
with him

  alfric led the assault of the rest on the
temple there were fewer guards on this
side of the gully he hewed at one and
felt the shock of the splitting skull through
his arms and shoulders rattling his teeth
howling he yanked the weapon free and
brought it up to knock aside a sword-
thrust and beat the foeman to earth

  back the household drove the guards
back to the scowling walls of the temple
weird battle in darkness and cold with
themoons and the great rising flames for
fitful illumination strange to trade blows
with men who were only red highlights
against the roaring night for a timeless
interval it was all clamor and death and
flying steel

  but the household was being carved
away-man after man fell-and now the
palace besiegers were streaming through
the gully ganimos and his squad cut off
on the bridge-hai hildaborg it had been
a lovely fight but it was nearing its end

  alfric looked up at the mighty sky and
he saw the majestic shield of dannos slip
over amaris her light was cut off the
hill-top grew dimmer-the moons were
mated

  o hildaborg if only-

  he looked along the wall against which
he now had his back and saw the torches
which swept up the hill saw the dark mass
of humanity and heard its beast cry for
blood and his heart leaped into his throat
and he laughed aloud under dannos for
here was life again

  hai hildaborg he roared

  the remaining troopers heard him and
lifted their weary heads to see they an-
swered his cry then and hewed a way to
where he stood and now the dismayed
temple forces were breaking-the house-

hold swept along the walls toward the
temple gates

  battle raged there as the rebel guards
and the blood-howling mob bore down on
the garrison fire was  already licking at
the rafters where flame arrows had struck
the temple would soon stand aflame even
as the palace was burning as the empire
was burning and sundering the two pil-
lars of valkarion were crashing to earth
and what would be left when they were
gone 

  by the leaping fire-blaze alfric saw
the torn and trampled bodies of priests
and slaves he recognized one battered
face and stooped over for a closer look
therokos lay dead his wound somehow
bandaged and braced his body cased in
armor he lay where he had fallen

  well the high priest had been a brave
man in his way-alfric gave him war-
riors salute and passed on to join the
fight

  an armored figure astride a great war-
hengist was leading the charge even with-
out hearing that lovely voice crying its
challenge alfric would have known her
he sprang forward crying out and seized
the bridle pulling her aside just as the
gate defense broke and the attackers burst
into the temple

  i told you to stay in a safe place he
raged huge and bloodsmeared his lean
face painted red by the rising fires his eyes
like green ice in the moonlight he stood
looking up at her

  hildaborg laughed youre still a poor
fool alfric she said could i stay at
home while you were fighting for me

  she took off her helmet her dark hair
streamed down over his face as she leaned
forward to kiss him

  in the sky dannos swept past amaris
and swung eastward toward the horizon

dawn came chill and gray-full of
weariness and the sobbing of wo-
men alfric stood leaning on a spear atop
the flat roof of bronnes the merchant

stories

and looked out over the city a leather
cloak hung from his broad shoulders
against the thin bitter dawn-wind his
face was drawn into bleak lines

  to him came hlidaborg lovely in the
cold colorless light her unbound locks
floating in the breeze he looked at her in
a vague wonder as to how many women
she really was the passionate lover of the
tavern the haughty queen who had faced
the captive guard and the captor priest
the wild war-goddess of the battle-and
now this girl slim and fair and mysterious
with wind-cooled cheeks and a secret laugh-
ter behind her eyes-which was the real
one or were they all hildaborg and
would he ever know

  she touched his arm weve won she
whispered

  aye-won said alfric tiredly won
what the temple is down but so is the
palace and theres still riot and looting in
the city

  it will pass victory was dearly bought
but now it is ours and you alfric are
ruler of valkarion

  i-a heathen outlander

  after last night the household and the
guards will follow you to hell and back
and the rest-she smiled shyly-will
follow me who follow you myself

  a big task too big perhaps for the
son of an aslakan peasant alfric smil-
ed crookedly down at hildaborg tis
more for you who are born a queen best
i continue my travels

  the queen she said firmly needs a
king you have come to the end of your
wandering alfric she laughed a clear
beautiful sound in the quiet morning you
have no choice my dear the sibyl grudg-
ingly admits that the fortieth dynasty
sons of the heathen will be among the
greatest but how can you have sons
without-

  alfric grinned i surrender he said
who am i to challenge the fates
down in the street a hengist escaped
from his owner in the rioting whinnied
his greeting to the early sun

dear mr- bixby

  let me begin by congratulating you for the best
issue in many a moon the march planet was
in comparison with both previous issues of your
magazine and with current competition outstand-
ing i was at first undecided whether to buy the
issue or nay for lately i have found much better
things to read and dont want to spend my time
consuming the kind of trash that is currently
flooding the science-fiction field i apologize ior
mentally placing you in that category the line-
up would have sold even the most hardened fan
indeed the contents page was thrilling reading
you have reached a new level-now stay up there
do you hear

  the only story i did not enjoy was asteriod
of fear which i skipped after the first five
pages leigh brackett is leigh brackett which
is heartily satisfying her story  was a relief
from coppels puny efforts to imitate her van
vogt was good also anderson and fyfe reprints
are not a bad idea but if you start to run out of
good material please have the good sense to
give it up the diversifal was a good
start i have dreams of rereading gardner foxs
the last monster take notice

  why must you make such a great improve-

ment in interior illustrations when you persist in
such trashy covers

  the vizigraph was dull and forunately brief
illuminated only by vigorous epistle of dennis
strong  mr strong has revealed a great deal
concerning his own nature while denouncing his
idiotic fellows ps readers we find at once that
mr strong is an infinitely superior creature
high above the standard norm one might say he
is a clear cleared this has not affected mr
strong in any way however he himself seems
to want to tell us he is a snob we find that mr
strong has a great knowledge and appreciation
of great literature he is the one man in the world
who understands ray bradbury one begins to
wonder why he reads planet when he could be
having the time of his life persuing something
educational such as the decameron we find
too a hidden meaning in his denunciation of us
poor psychopathetical pseudo-intellects we find
here a highly egotistical snob whose own ego is
either so steeped in a superiority complex or so
ingulfed in an inferiority complex that he must
denounce the attempts of science-fiction fans and
readers a group of which every member is a
sub-moron but himself to be funny and then
must end his letter with a disgustingly unwitty
paragraph concerning the spelling of a mans
name perhaps by itself mr strongs effort
might seem mildly amusing but climaxing the
flood of insult and abuse which he has written
it is nauseously out of place and degrading oh
were cicero alive how he could denounce the
likes of you there you have it mr strong
you do not like us and you have insulted us we
are not going to waste time defending ourselves
answering your charges you are not going to
like the next few editions of the vizigraph sir
you have said your piece now hear ours then
stop reading us and leave us alone

dear editor

  may i enter a brief oeef

   i always read the readers comments in maga-
zines because i consider them as interesting as
any story but your letter pages seem to be noth-
ing but a series of one just like the next flip-
pant wise-cracking screw-ball creations redolent
of high school humor your readers-most of
them-seem to be unable to express an opinion
of your story offerings in simple english its
got to be in the form of some weird word-
scrambled prose or poetry as if some kid were
pounding wildly at the typewriter keys alter-
nating between red and black ribbons and caps
and small letters so that the result read like
some pictograph puzzle no one objects to humor
or wit in writing but your vizigraph pages bear
the same resemblance to critical letters that
jitterbugging does to normal ballroom dancing
doesnt anyone ever write in to ps to say sen-
sibly and briefly that he likes or doesnt like a
certain story because-and then go on from there

dear ed

  the first thing that really gave me a jolt was
the heroines nom depee leigh bracketts
heroine of course first of all its an old irish
name and more startling its the gaelic version
of my own name the gaelic c being equiva-
lent to our k and the ai phoneticizing to
e

  this having naturally  intrigued me four
years of high-school latin does horrible things
to your english i looked around and sure
enough found a few other things ban cruach
whose last name is the name of a grim old idol
lugh from lugh lamfada the ildanach or the-
doer-of-all-things the nearest equivalent of a
gaelic sun-god balin i think is welch in ori-
gin but thats only a guess one of conaire
mors foster-sons was named rogain fer rogain
to be exact well thats all i noticed-arent you
glad i guess a writer has to get names from
somwhere

  im glad lord ciaran was supposed to be a
man otherwise idve been insulted

  i get more darn mail addressed to miss keran
obrien even a subscription to a sf magazine-
not yours

  this letter is longer than was intended at the
start letters have a habit of doing such things
anyway i have a physics paper to write so
good-bye

dear jerry

  in reading the vizigraph in the march 
naturally ish i ran into two letters that made
me sit up and take notice both no doubt were
inserted by the powers that be to further the
cause of corresponding readers giving them
something to chaw on in the order they ap-
peared 

  on page  michael wigodsky says apropo
of something i missed the story he speaks of
and since no change in size in the infected
subjects was mentioned how does mr coppe
account for the fact the apes which man most
resembles or vice versa are the small usually
that is lemurs i wont quarrel too much with
him for calling lemurs apes since the ameri-
can college dictionary says apes can be defined

as any monkey-although in this same letter
mr wigodsky seems to apply the common dis-
tinction since he says just before the above
quotation i started to writes apes instead of
monkeys above  but remembered in time that
there are no native american apes-but i object
to the statement that the apes which man most
resembles    are the    lemurs i hope you
arent getting tired of quotations for here comes
one on which i base my objection well to tell
the truth it is the only one i can put my finger
on right off though im sure scholarly research
would produce more and the actions of lemus
betray only commensurate mentality with no
hint that they are related to the four most intelli-
gent animals in the world italics are mine
the lemurs are in fact very ordinary small mam-
mals simple and rather primitive who have
barely enough peculiarities to be classed as pri-
mates this quotation comes from mankind so
far by william howells page  if mr wigod-
sky meant that lemurs are the closest living rela-
tives of the unspecialized primate that is con-
sidered to be the ancestor of modern primates
i am unable to argue with him for idont know
but that is not the impression i received in read-
ing his letter well just thought id mention it

i	dare say youll get some really learned letters
from anthropology professors the country over

  the second letter calling me to my trusty
typewriter is that by dennis strong i think the
man is to be congratulated not on what he
said but on how he said it it must have taken
a great deal of brain belabouring and research
to come up with as fine a string of epithets as
ive ever seen pass the censors office the very
heatedness of his language seems to me to smack
of - cold-blooded intentionalism-the intent being
to get into the vizigraph and to stir up a holo-
caust of letters if as he avows his intent is to
define what i consider to be a malign influence
in science-fiction today why did he not do it
in language less likely to arouse emotions and
which would be even more exact had he been
more temperate in his letter i would be inclined
to agree with him i think he does have a
point but i deplore his expression of it mod-
eration moderation my dear sir still has
some adherents i said he does have a point-
the mere listing of stories is a sentiment i can
wholeheartedly agree with but i notice such
letters are scarce in this issue may they get
scarcer ill leave the vitriolic name calling to
those more in practice than i and im sure mr
strong gods of greece what if dennis strong
is a woman will receive more than he bar-
gained for in reply to that letter incidentally
that letter rings bells of memory i have seen
similar epistles published in quite a few copies
of stf mags over the years is it a small- well-
established cult or just scattered individuals
