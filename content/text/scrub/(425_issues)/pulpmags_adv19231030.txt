hat is quite true senor every
man must be his own judge as
to the kind of gun he should
use

 there are fashions in guns and in the way
of carrying them too and no doubt those
styles are different in different places but
any one who follows any fashion that does
not suit his own needs is unwise even if it
be only a question of shoes or hat and in
the matter of a gun-if he lets fashion force
him into carrying a gun unfit for his own
build and his own wants he is a fool

 so senor since you and your partner find
your  repeaters best for you take them
with you on your gold-hunt up -the rio
caroni as i have told you this venezuela
of ours is a  country but if you brought
plenty of ammunition from your north
america you need not care for that

  the thirty gang copyright  by arthur o friel

 como how is that you have two
thousand rounds for the rifles alone val-
game diost i have known revolutionists
to capture half the towns on this orinoco
with less you will not use a quarter of
them unless you stay in the caroni bush
much longer than you now expect and you
will find that so many cartridges are most
infernally heavy to carry still it is better
to have too many than too few

  besides if you decide later to lighten your
load you can do so at a good profit you
have only to tell the indians up there that
you have cartridges of  caliber to trade
and very soon you will be visited by brown
men bringing little bags of gold they will
buy every cartridge you are willing to sell-
and your rifles also if you are careless
enough to part with them

  oh no senor those indios themselves
will not use the cartridges they are

bow-and-arrow men having no guns except
a few long muzzle-loading small bores but
they will buy your thirties because they know
they can trade them in turn to the cuadril-
la treinta as we call it-la cuadrilla de
treinta-the thirty gang have i not
told you of that mysterious band which
from time to time crosses the whole length of
the unknown guayana highlands in order to
buy cartridges of  caliber

  they are indians all indians of the ma-
quiritare nation and descendants of the old
fighting caribs who held this land when the
first white men came indians who live in
the jungled mountains from which spring
the rivers caura and ventuari and in which
only two white men ever walk one of
those white men is i loco leon the only
blond spaniard in all the back bush of
venezuela and therefore much whiter
than any other white to be found there
the other is black white-el blanco
negro-the north american whose skin and
whose mind both were turned black years
ago by a maquiritare maiden and who con-
sequently is white only in name

   it is for him for black white that those
indios cross the cruel parima mountains
and buy cartridges by some secret trade-
route of their own they go all the way to the
river cuyuni in guayana inglesa british
guiana where men hunt diamonds and
gold and from those gold-hunters who have
ways of getting cartridges in spite of the
laws they buy those bullets-always of
caliber 

  that is why the cuyuni men call them the
thirty gang and because the thirty
gang pays high and always has plenty of
gcid though no man has ever learned where

they find it some of those cuyuni men have
smuggled in rifles as well as cartridges for
sale to the brown men and black white
the renegade who brought into the maquiri-
tare land the first high-power rifle ever seen
there now has about him a little force so
well-armed and so wily that i do not believe
the whole federal army of venezuela could
ever capture him if it tried

  i learned of those guns in a rather odd
way and since that time i have puzzled
more than once over what then came about
or rather over the thing that black white
then did to any one not acquainted with
white as i am it might not seem so strange
but i know him to be a madman a man
ruined heart and soul by the terrible
secret drink of the caribs which was given
him by the maquiritare girl whom he had
made his plaything and whom he then in-
tended to abandon a man who was heartless
enough before that time and who since then
has been bitter against man woman and
god and to think that such a man-

  but let me begin at the beginning this
ron anciado has a way of making the tongue
wag off sidewise unless one takes enough to
keep it well oiled tobalito here mu-
chacho another bottle of the same and
charge it to my account and bring fresh
glasses for three

i

now as i have told you senores
before this i am a rover of the
balata rubber country where the
maquiritares live in the dry time when
no balata can be gathered i ramble in those
wild mountains both for business and for
pleasure i scout for new rubber trees i
visit the tribe-houses of my maquiritare
friends and i enjoy the freedom and the
sudden adventures of the untamed high-
lands in the rainy season my maquiri-
tares work the balata for me at the places
i have chosen and when the crop is in i
bring it down the orinoco to sell to blums
commission house here in ciudad bolivar
then i return to the uplands

  i am the only bianco in all venezuela who
can follow this life among the maquiritares
for i am the only one whom they trust
throughout their land the name of loco
leon is known as that of an amigo and a
buen hombre who always keeps his word and
treats them justly
the thirty gang



  there are other men of course who also
work the balata in the up-orinoco country-
but none who work it in the home-land of
the maquiritares they would do so if
they could but they know the brown men
would not let them perhaps when this
tale of mine is done you will understand
why the indians keep those brutes out of
their hills

  it was three years ago when this thing
came about it was also three years from
the time when white had been turned into
black white by juana daughter of the
chief of the maquiritares of uauana at the
top of the perilous river ventuari

  since that day i never had seen the face
of that blackened man nor did i wish to
for he has sworn that no white man shall
look on his fiace and live to tell of it and he
means what he says but i had heard his
voice at times and knew he still lived for
sometimes at night he would arrive un-
expectedly and standing back in the dark-
ness where the light of my little camp-fire
would not reveal him he would order me to
talk to him in english and i would talk
until as suddenly as he had come he went
i knew too that the girl juana always was
with him for i heard her voice also

  but except for these things i knew nothing
of him because the maquiritares would not
talk about him even to me

  now in that year of which i speak i
had finished my seasons work brought
my balata down the orinoco to bolivar
taken my annual holiday and gone back up
the big river thus i had come to san
fernando de atabapo the only town in the
big territorio de amazonas and the place
from which the murder-maniac tomas
fanes and his cut-throat army ruled the
whole up-orinoco country it was also the
place where my rivals in the balata trade
lived in the dry season

  they had no love for me those san fer-
nando men nor i for them they were
jealous of me because thanks to my straight
dealings with the maquiritares i always got
far bigger cargoes of balata than they could
gather by brutal methods my feelings
toward them and their town was that of
any normal man toward a den of snakes

  but for several reasons it was neces-
sary for me to stop at san fernando i
had to change boats leaving the piragua in
which my crew had poled up from the rapids
of maipures and transferring my trade-

goods to the long curial which i use on the
ventuari i had to visit funes and tell him
what i had seen and heard down the river
every one traveling up had to do this or
risk being executed for disrespect to the
tyrant and i had to walk about meet 
my enemies and look them in the eye and
let them see that i was not afraid of them
so i stopped at the town and did all these
things

  funes was in a sour mood that day
but i told him several funny stories about
happenings here in bolivar and before i
left him he was roaring like an areguato
monkey then i strolled about the town
taking a drink here and there listening to
what i might hear and talking to men who
ached to kill me

   there was not the least doubt in my mind
as to what those enemies of mine wanted
to do but i did not swagger about with
rifle ready as if seeking trouble indeed

i had deliberately left my rifle in funes
house asking one of his bodyguard to take
care of it for me and my poniard and re-
volver were at my waist under my loose
white coat-though the coat was unbut-
toned nor did those men who longed to
see my blood spattering on the ground
speak what was in their black hearts
things were not done so roughly in funes
town-unless funes himself ordered it

  hola loco len was the hearty
greeting i got from the snake-tongued men

como st uste amigo how are things
below come and have a drink

   and their hands would carelessly slip a
little nearer to their belts

  gracia lucio i would say i will
have that drink anc buy you two in return
all is well down the river how is it with
you

  and my arm would accidentally brush
my coat back a trifle more from my hips

  and while we smiled and spoke so with
our lips their eyes would say-

   your life hangs by a thread and at my
own time i shall cut it

  and mine would answer-

  it will take a better man than you to
doit

  so we would drink and joke-with our
mouths and all would look as peaceful
as windless water

  yet these men who greeted me so cor-
dially had boasted about what they would
do to me when next i should come to town


adventure

those brags had come to my ears and now

i	was giving them their chance to start
something as you north americans say
and i was not the only one who waited
to see how well the boasters made good
their threats while i stood and drank
in the casa del pueblo other men came
carelessly drifting in or loitered around the
doors looking very innocent but watching
and listening to what went on

  they kept on waiting for nothing hap-
pened i drank with every one of the men
who had talked so loudly when i was far
away and they still did nothing but talk
what is more they were careful how they
talked

  several times one or another of them
passed behind my back but i gave no
attention to them i knew that at that
moment toms funes felt good-humored
toward me and that every man in town was
aware of it and so every one of them knew
that whoever stabbed me in the back would
very soon be beheaded at funes order
of course if i should be killed in a fight
or by accident that would be another
matter

  since nobody started a fight and there
seemed to be little chance of an accident
just then i decided to quit drinking i had
had enough and the boasters had not even
boasted in my hearing so there was no
sense in wasting more time and money
there there was a full cup of cabauo
bianco white rum on the bar before me and
after tossing it off i would leave the place
but i never drank that liquor

  the little room was very hot and the
man at my right pushed away from the bar
and went to the door another man
stepped into his place with his rifle swing-
ing at his left leg glancing at him i saw
that he was a hard fellow named diego
who belonged to one of my snaky enemies
oton argel and argel himself had been
standing for some time at my other side
and still stood there so i was between
argel and his man

  now this argel was supposed to be one
of tomas funes pets i say supposed
to be because no man ever could be sure
of himself with funes no matter how
slavishly he obeyed the tyrants whims
he might suddenly find himself out of favor
and lucky if he escaped with his life for
funes trusted nobody and many of the
men killed by his order were murdered be-

cause he suspected them of plotting against
him

  he did not even trust his own mistress-
in which perhaps he was wise still as
i say this argel was believed to be in the
good graces of funes-though he had not
succeeded in convincing his master that i
ought to be executed as he probably had
tried to do

  he had been drinking there with me for
some time but i knew he had taken no more
than i yet now he began to act drunk
he laughed very loud slapped the bar
with his hands and threw his shoulders
about quite clumsily and diego saying
nothing stood loosely at my right side
his gun-butt on the floor and his eyes on the
rum before him his left hand hung down
beside his rifle

  i was no stranger to san fernando and
its ways and i smelt an accident pay-
ing no attention to diego i watched the
staggering argel cornerwise and moved
my right hand toward my cup of rum at
that instant argel lurched heavily to-
ward me

  my hand clutched the edge of the bar and
i threw myself back with all my strength
in the same second diegos gun belched
flame across my abdomen burning pow-
der stung my flesh argel gave a hoarse
horrible sound his thick body thumped
on the floor arid he writhed on the spot
where my feet had just been

ii

dios mior yelled diego the
gun has exploded loco len is
hurt

  he yelled it even as his master was fall-
ing yelled it too quickly showing that he
had the words ready to shout as soon as his
bullet tore through me with the words
he twitched his left hand to drop the black
thread now broken by which he had pulled
the trigger of his cocked gun when his
master shoved me

  it was not a very new trick in san fer-
nando but up to now it had always worked
well an accidental push against a
loaded rifle-an accidental explosion-
made an accident that was always
loudly bemoaned by the fellow with the gun
but not by the victim a  slug sent
upward from under the ribs blows all
moans out of a man
the thirty gang

 

a

  but when diego saw whom that bullet
had caught the other things he had ready
to say stuck in his throat argel struggled
over on one side before he died and his
wicked eyes glared up at diego who stood
like a stone

  -roast you forever gasped argel

then he crumpled up and was quiet diego
still holding his thread lifted his face in a
dazed way and stared at me

  a slight mistake diego i said it
is not loco leon who is hurt but that is
the fault of argel not yours you had
better find a patrdn who is not so clumsy
i was angry enough to kill him-a pow-
der burn across the belly does not improve
a mans temper-but i let him live he
was only a tool and the real assassin-argel
-had paid in full later i laughed long
over the joke of it but just then i was not
in a merry mood

  his hand went to his machete but he
did not draw his rifle was on the floor
where it had dropped in the accident
and he let it lie i gave him a hard shove
that sent him sprawling and then started
for the door but before i reached it there
was work to do

  erasmo argel brother of the dead man
let out a squall like a maddened cat and
jumped for me

  my brother len has killed my
brother he screeched his dagger was
out and he stabbed for my throat other
men too snarled i had to fight fast if i
was to leave that place alive

  i dodged the knife and shot erasmo in
the stomach aid then with revolver in
one hand and poniard in the other i shot
and stabbed my way straight out of there
i did not pick my men-i had no friends
there and i attacked everybody in my way
the watchers at the door broke and scat-
tered to get away from me they had
nothing in particular against me and had
come only to see what might take place
and now they were well pleased with the
show so with gun empty but knife
ready i walked away without further
trouble

  there was mad swearing back in the rum-
shop but the outsiders laughed and called
after me

  well fought leon the coronel will
make you a sargento primero in the army
and i heard one say

  for dios but this loco leon is well

named when he fights he is a mad lion in

truth

  but mad lion though i might be i was
a lone lion among a big pack of treacherous
dogs and i had no wish to stay there
those who cheered me now might shoot
me down in the next ten minutes funes
might laugh over the end of the argel
brothers or he might have me tied to a
tree and beheaded i decided to make a
complaint to funes himself before others
could complain of me and then to get away
as quickly as possible so reloading as i
went i swiftly crossed the plaza to funes
headquarters

  it had grown dark now and i was halted
sharply at funes door and held there until
a lantern was put to my face the guard
had been changed at sundown and it hap-
pened to be under command of amauo
lopez who was by far the best man in
funes whole force a brave sensible fellow
who when funes finally was captured and
executed in  by the army of cedeno
died fighting to the last for his chief he
was the one man in the place worthy of
any respect

  ah it is loco leon he said you
can not see the coronel now lofco he
orders that nobody disturb him before
morning as he entertains two women
what was the shooting over there

  it was my shooting i answered boldly
see my shirt is shot away by that hound
of an oton argel he tried the rifle acci-
dent on me erasmo tried stabbing me
both are dead and others also now i
want to know if this was done by the order
of the coronel if he wants my life why
does he not take it in the usual way

  whenever he wants it he will take it in
that way amalio answered grimly he
gave the argels no instructions they are
dead  i am glad of it but this may be
serious for you loco the chief had use
for them

  he has use for me also i snapped back
i pay him a larger balata tax than any
other man in this rio negro country
what is more it was only a little while ago
that i amused him much and that is worth
more than money and if those dogs would
try killing me without authority would
they not do other things against authority
might they not even try to murder the chief
himself who knows

  that is so amalio slowly agreed


adventure

the one thought always in the mind of
funes and his men was that some one
would try to kill him well you will see
him tomorrow then he will do as he sees
fit now go-
i intended to go fartner than he meant
me to for i suspected that funes might fee
ugly-tempered in the morning but i gave
no sign of my intentions i only said

  bueno but give me my rifle which
i left here i may need it before sunrise
he grinned a little and ordered that my
gun be brought by this time other men
had gathered but none came too near
when my rifle was in my hands i said to
those watching

  i go walking and i sleep alone let
none of you try to follow amalio thank
you and buen noche

 bum nochehe yawned and i
walked away into the dark and none
followed

  i walked southward as if heading for the
house where i usually slept when in the
town but at the first dark corner i slipped
around and loped down toward the river
atabapo where my loaded curial lay

  whether my crew of mestizos who usually
paddled me as far as my first siiio on the
ventuari was at the canoe now i did not
know though i had ordered that two men
sleep there in order to prevent thievery
from my supplies but luck was with me-
they all were there gambling on a box-top
arid laughing or cursing as the tumbling
dice gave them suertes or azares my
movements since the fight had been so rapid
that nobody had yet come down to tell
them about it

  we have now i said jumping among
them before they realized that i was arriv-
ing out into the river move

 they gaped a second or two one
spoke

  leave now tonight in darkness
we leave now i growled there
is trouble unless we jump out of here
there will be more vamos

  they jumped sudden trouble was noth-
ing new to them-they were san fernando
men themselves of the peon class-and they
knew the value of acting first and thinking
afterward in less than a minute we were
aboajrd and had shoved away and i had
blown out the lantern

  straight out i ordered then down-
stream

  their paddles thumped for a couple of
minutes on the gunwales before any call
came from behind then sounded a yell

  loco leon you dog you pig you-

- come here and fight

  lanterns were swinging down the sloping
shore toward the spot where the canoe had
lain somebody had seen me dodge around
that corner and now the dog-pack was be-
ginning to yelp i cocked my gun and
stood up intending to teach them manners
but then realizing that my gun-flash
would give them a target i held my fire
with only the dull thump of the receding
paddles to shoot at they were hardly
likely to do me any harm and i had spilled
enough blood there for one night

  getting no answer they yelped all the
more boldly half a dozen rifles blazed at
me but the bullets flew wild my men
without orders began silencing their strokes
with hardly a sound we slid on toward the
midstream island the current carrying us
downward all the time then from the
shore sounded a voice speaking loudly to
the other men

  save your bullets save your bullets
let the fool go do you not know that paco
peldom waits for him at the boca del ven-
tuari the gang of paco will not fail

  a rumble of other voices followed and
the lanterns began to move back toward the
streets then i answered them in a way
that i knew would madden them more than
bullets or curses i laughed laughed loud
and high as if i found them only amusing
and contemptible

  they bawled curses of course but i gave
none in return we now were far enough
out to avoid the rocky point below the
town and i gave the word to head straight
down the river i was out of san fer-
nando and i had no time to think further
of ivhat lay behind i was already figuring
on what waited ahead

  as san fernando lies on a point with the
river atabapo in front and the orinoco be-
hind these enemies of mine might cut across
to get me when i passed up the orinoco
i thought this improbable however for it
meant half a mile of walking through the
night and they were much more likely to
go back to the rum-shop-especially since
they knew that paco peldom was waiting
for me it was paco and his gang lurking
at the mouth of my own river that gave
me some real thinking to do the drunken
the thirty gang



fool who blurted that out had done me an
unintended favor

  the plot was bigger than i had supposed
this paco was no balata merchant like
the brothers argel and others who hated me
for business reasons he was a killer and
head of a small but deadly band of men out-
lawed from venezuela colombia and
brazil one of funes tools and so inhuman
that he was nicknamed el carnicero-the
butcher

  there were many such brutes in the
army of funes for birds of a feather flock
together and funes himself a murderous
outlaw drew around him the worst men in
three countries they took orders of
course from the master cut-throat himself
but they also operated on their own
accounts killing and robbing for loot for
lust or for pay during the eight years of
terror in the up-orinoco country many a
hideous crime was committed which tomas
funes never intended and if -any of his
men was worse than this paco beldom i
have not heard of that man

  now since i carry little money up the
river with me-i leave almost all of it in
bank here at bolivar-paco could expect
no plunder from my boat except my indian
trade-goods which would hardly tempt him
there had been no trouble between us so
he was not seeking revenge funes had
shown no desire to kill me yet the only
good reason i could see then for this gang
to want my life was for pay and the only
people likely to pay them much for their
trouble were my business enemies

  so i concluded that those enemies had
sent paco up to the ventuari to take care
of me when i should arrive there and that
the argel accident had come about be-
cause oton was not satisfied to let well
enough alone if i was killed in san fer-
nando he would not have to pay paco for
my head

  with me dead perhaps the plan was to
seize my balata country in force and compel
my maquiritare friends to work it or bring
in other weaker indians as slaves with
me alive there was not much chance for
those schemers to get anything on the ven-
tuari except bullets and arrows

  all this i thought over while we slid down
the atabapo and swung around the point
into the orinoco and then making a map
of the ventuari and the orinoco in my mind
i began to laugh

  paco i said to the night you and
your wolves never fail no well we shall
see

ill

the delta of the ventuari senorcs
is a puzzling place there two
powerful rivers the orinoco and
the ventuari both born in the eastern
mountains meet each other head-on like a
pair of bulls locking horns since neither
can push the other back into its own
mountains and both must go somewhere
they stagger off westward together until
they meet the atabapo and the guaviare
which help the orinoco to go northward
again

  i suppose it is this everlasting fight be-
tween the two rivers which has gouged out
the land all around their meeting-place and
made the great raudal de santa barbara
at any rate the raudal is there and it is a
huge bay full of islands big and little and
among these islands an experienced river-
man can pick quite a number of channels
if he will and i who had worked rubber
for years on the alto orinoco before moving
to the ventuari knew most of the ways
through that labyrinth so if i had known
just where paco waited to kill me i could
have dodged around his gang with little
trouble that is i could have done so if
he had been among the islands of the delta

  but paco too knew his orinoco and
since he was there for the purpose of getting
me he would hardly wait at any place where
there was any chance for me to slip past him
he would go far enough up the ventuari to
be clear of the islands and make camp at
some point where he could not fail to see
me he would be a fool to do otherwise

  yet there was still a way of getting around
him it was a long way and a hard way
and a way open to only one white man in
the world-to me loco leon rover of the
wilds and friend of the maquiritares and
rough though that way was the thought
of it was what had made me laugh there
on the dark orinoco for no road is too hard
for the man who would cheat his foes and
save his life

  besides i had plenty of time and little
to do and i could see a bit of new country
by taking this long swing and so far as
my san fernando friends were concerned
i could disappear completely not even
io

adventure

the mestizos who now paddled my canoe
would be able to tell of my trail

   so i lay back in the carroza and chuckled
 and the paddlers thumped on through the
 darkness with never a word i knew they
 had heard that loud voice and what it said
 but i did not believe they knew anything
 more than that for they had been my crew
 on the journey to bolivar and back and so
 their recent stop in san fernando had been
 no longer than my own and the plan of
 having me killed by the butcher probably
 was not generally known in the town since
 it was made without the knowledge of
 funes himself at the same time i did not
 trust them any too much

  when we had gone far enough up the
orinoco to be well beyond the town i made
them work to the north shore and paddle
on until the lantern now burning again
showed us a bare rock there we tied up

   you will sleep on the stone i told them
 and do not come aboard before dawn
 they made no objection they only
 asked that i give them the lantern so that
 no tigre might pounce on them in the night
 since it is customary to burn a lantern in
 that way when sleeping so i let them have
 it they picked their places and lay down
 and i stretched out inside the little cabin
 but i did not sleep at once they were
 talking low among themselves and i knew
 that presently they would speak a little
 louder as they always did when discussing
 something

   soon i caught the name el carnicero
and before long one argued

   but no tito why should he spare us
he drinks blood like a murcielago-a vam-
pire bat do you think he will let us go to-
tell of what he did to el capitdn you are
simple

  that was what i had listened for it
told me that these men had not been bribed
to kill me and that they worried for fear
paco would murder them as well as me-
which was not at all unlikely  so i knew
i could sleep peacefully that night

   oh be quiet i growled as if disturbed
 by their voices the butcher is a fool and
 i will make a monkey of him he will not
 even see you

   como capitdn somebody asked eager-
ly how

   i will show you now be still

   they hushed and i went to sleep

   at dawn we were up and at sunrise we

were away and all that day and all the
next we crawled on up the river undis-
turbed two or three dugouts and one
piragua passed us but all were going down-
 stream from san fernando came no boat

  my men had traveled with me before
and they knew i had the habit of getting
the better of any one who attacked me
they also knew i would pay them well for
their work and that it was best for them
not to desert me

   still the thought of the butcher worked
on their minds as was only natural so
did the fact that i who had not the repu-
tation of running away from anybody had
left the town in such a hurry and on the
second day as we neared the big raudal one
of them made bold to ask me why paco
wanted me

   i told them i did not know unless he was
hired for the job i also told them just
what had come about at san fernando and
they laughed about it for half an hour after-
ward for none of them liked the argels and
then deciding that it was time to hearten
them and to tell them what they must know
in a few hours i added

   paco waits for us in the ventuari let
us wish him a pleasant time there he
thinks himself very clever but there are
many things he does not know one of
them is that on this trip i do not go up the
ventuari but up the orinoco

   they stared

  como you are quitting your ventuari
grounds one asked

  the grounds on the lower ventuari are
worked out and the upper river is so dan-
gerous that it would be very hard to bring
out the crop next year i answered this
was true so i shall look at another river
but the other rivers where balata grows
are the grounds of other men the man said

   that is their affair and mine not yours
i reminded him we go up the orinoco
and paco waits up the ventuari and swears
they laughed again much relieved if i
wanted to steal some other mans ground
that was nothing to them indeed it would
be another joke for them to tell when they
returned to san fernando

  they wondered of course what river i
had in mind but i did not tell them their
job was to do my paddling not my planning
and now with three jokes to think about-
oton killed in his own trap- paco fooled
and somebodys balata grounds jumped by
the thirty gang

ii

loco leon-they paddled right merrily

  in the next few days we worked through
santa barbara seeing nothing of the
butchers gang swung southward and then
eastward up the orinoco and passed river
after river flowing in from the mountains
at the north at each of these rivers my
men looked at me and the steersman called
forward

  aqui capitdn here

  no i answered

  and we kept on

  after i had said this at half a dozen river-
mouths it became a sort of joke with them
and even at little canos where they knew i
would not turn they asked-

  aqui

  they did not care how far we went for
the longer we traveled the more pesos they
earned and when about forty leagues
from the great raudal i suddenly answered
si to their question they seemed
astonished

  we had reached the mouth of the cunu-
cunuma a wild rough river dashing straight
south from high mountains and very hard
to travel because it is full of raudales in
the country up this river grows the balata
and some of this balata had been worked
during the previous wet season by pascual
rivero of san fernando

  but the balata of rivero did not interest
me what had brought me there was the
fact that on the cunucunuma lived a tribe
of maquiritares

gsbi years before while i was on the
nflfj river padamo near the head of the
orinoco some of those maquiritares
of the cunucunuma had worked for me
so though i never had been up their stream
i was known to those indians and though
the maquiritares change their homes at
times moving from river to river for reasons
known only to themselves the cunucunuma
men had been in their old place during the
season just past and some of them had
worked for rivero so they probably were
there now and i had use for them

  when i told my crew to enter the cunu-
cunuma they were a little slow in obeying
and their faces showed that they were think-
ing about something but they made no
objection and i would not ask them what
was on their minds they probably would
tell me when they had thought about it
long enough

  up into the northern river we turned
and after a little hard paddling against its
stiff current we halted to cut poles for the
water was only a yard or two deep so that
poling would be easier than swinging the
paddle

  while the men chopped their poles and
trimmed the bark from them i heard low-
toned talking and i looked up the dark
clear water wondering what bothered them
now nobody would be on that stream at
that time of year except the maquiritares
i thought and my men surely must know
that all maquiritares were my friends
when they came back though i learned
something

  capitdn said the steersman do you
know that ramon rodriguez is on this
river

  i stared then scowled ramon ro-
driguez was the foreman of rivero he kept
the balata work moving in its season and
had much more to do with the workmen
than rivero himself and he was somewhat
more aggressive than his chief

  rivero was sly he was as bad as rodri-
guez or worse but he was the sort of man
who gets what he wants by lying cheating
and letting others stand in his place if any
danger has to be faced

  rodriguez had more courage though
none too much he could bluster and drive
men who seemed unlikely to turn on him
but if he had to meet an enemy he would
rather shoot him from behind than fight
him face to face he and his chief had
gotten along with the maquiritares of this
river because the indians were paid some-
thing though very little in trade goods by
rivero and because they cared nothing for
ramons loud talk so long as he did nothing
worse than talk

  but a loud mouth deceives some people
into thinking a man far more bold and reck-
less than he is and these mestizos of mine
were a little troubled about carrying me up
to seize riveros grounds when they knew
rodriguez was likely to see them do it to
tell all san fernando about it afterward
would be one thing but to face rodriguez
on the cunucunuma was another

  i snorted at the idea of any one fearing
that man but i was none too well pleased
to find him or any other outsider here for
i had amused myself so much with the
thought of fooling every one that i hated
to see my joke spoiled


 adventure

  how is that i demanded this is
not the rubber season

  he is here was the answer we heard
he had a woman here and he came up a
week before us

  a woman on the cunucunuma what
sort of woman

  a young one a light indian he told
about her when he was drunk at san fer-
nando he has come back to her

  a maquiritare

  si

  if that is so i laughed i will take
her away from him vamosl

  so we went on and as we went i
chuckled and scowled by turns rodriguez
was a drunken liar and the san fernando
rum-drinkers believed him i would tell
myself

  but then again i was not so sure if
rodriguez really was up there and making
bold with some maquiritare woman trouble
was likely to be in the air and when it
came it would break like one of those up-
orinoco thunderstorms sudden and dan-
gerous i had not lived so long among the
maquiritares without knowing how they
fell about their women

  two days up the river i suddenly became
sure that rodriguez was on the cunu-
cunuma it was nearly noon and we had
passed through a bad raudal and were poling
quietly along smooth water when we smelt
smoke then rounding a big rock we came
on several men just beyond clustered
around a small cooking-fire on the sandy
shore one of them jumped up with a
startled curse he was rodriguez

  and among the cotton-shirted figures
which remained squatting and staring at
us was one without a shirt it was a
woman

          tv

rodriguez stood there a mo-
ment with his rifle half-raised his
thumb on its hammer and his eyes
on us he was by no means handsome at
any time and now scowling and glowering
he looked an ugly brute indeed his men
who were mestizos like my own kept
wooden faces

  who in-are these men he growled

i was still sitting in the carroza and he
could not see me well

  the crew of loco leon one of his pad-

dlers told him i crept out and stood up
and as rodriguez looked at me his face grew
uglier than before

  buenas tardes ramon i greeted him
do you travel up or down

  what is that to you he snarled
what in the name of el didblo are you doing
up here leon

  i am riding in a curial as you can see
for yourself i coolly replied  and i am
stopping to eat almuerzo with you

  with that my canoe grounded and hold-
ing my rifle forward i stepped overboard
and ashore looking him in the eye all the
time

  he opened his jaws as if to say some-
thing but thought better of it with a
sour grumble he stepped back a little
glancing down at the woman after swiftly
surveying his nien and noting that they
showed no sign of backing their disagreeable
master i too looked at her

  she was looking straight back at me with
much interest as i have said i am the
only blond venezolano on the whole upper
orinoco and when i travel on the big river
i always let the hair grow on my face-it
helps to keep off the mosquitoes and by
this time my yellow beard was quite long
and very odd-looking in that land of black
hair my blue eyes too always are noticed
by strangers who are used to seeing only
brown or black ones

  so being accustomed to stares from peo-
ple who had not seen me before i gave no
attention to her steady regard what inter-
ested me was the fact that she was there
with rodriguez

  she was young just past her girlhood-
perhaps fifteen years old the indian girls
in our country become women early and
the change is swift she was plump strong-
ly built firm-breasted and very light of
skin light even for the forest-dwelling
maquiritares who are much more fair than
the guahibos and other indians of the sun-
burned plains except for the fact that her
face had the flatness so often found among
indians she was attractive to the eye of
almost any venezolano

  did you come here to eat or to look at
my woman rodriguez demanded roughly

  to eat but since the woman is here
i look at her and since i know something
about maquiritares ramon i ask you how
you got her the maquiritares do not let
their girls go out to live with venezolanos
the thirty gang



  no he sneered you see that this
one goes out with me do you not your
maquiritares have nothing to say about
it-or you either what ramon rodriguez
wants he takes

  he was putting more force behind every
word working into his usual loud boldness
i decided to show him and all the listeners
where he stood in the opinion of loco
leon

  you need not yell at me i told him
i am not deaf and do not forget that
while any dog can growl and show his teeth
it is one thing to bark and another to anger
a len the wise cur is the one who
knows enough to make little noise when
the len is near enough to use his
claws

  ramn had to fight then and there or give
ground he did not fight did not even
make a move to show he thought of fighting
after a very quiet minute while all the
others held their breath he laughed loudly
as if at a ood joke

  you are becoming wise i see i went
on but not so wise either you seem
to have barked yourself into the belief that
you are a guapo and because the maquiri-
tares are quiet good-humored fellows you
think they are macos you are mistaken
both in yourself and in them 

  i glanced down again at the girl and back
at him

  if you took this girl away as you say
you will find that her people will say some-
thing about it if you ever come here again
i added but you never took her so you
would not dare so she must be going with
you of her own will though i cannot un-
derstand why she certainly cannot have
fallen in love with your mud-turtle
face

  at this my mestizos cackled and even
the men of rodriguez snickered ramon
seemed to bloat with rage i had told him
the exact truth about himself and it stung
as the truth sometimes does and to be
ridiculed so before men who would tell it
all over san fernando was more than he
could stand

  i would not dare he yelled i
ramn rodriguez would fear those indios
carambal i fear nobody-neither maquiri-
tare nor loco len i took this woman
today from her people-threw her into my

   	guapo-in venezuela a bold bad-manj the macos
are notorious cowards

curial and made her come and i stop here
to eat-i take my time-i do not nm from
her whole tribe let them come on if they
dare bah they know better than to
follow ramon rodriguez

  he was shouting again as usual to prove
how brave he was-as if bravery were a
matter of mouth but his way of saying
it made me think perhaps he was telling the
truth about his way of gaining the girl i
took my eyes off him long enough to glance
at the faces of his men and one of them
nodded to me the others looked around
them a little uneasily it was true rodri-
guez had stolen the girl

  then you are a bigger fool than i
thought i told him i had already de-
cided that i would not eat at your fire
but now i do not even want to talk longer
to you

  with that i stepped away from him-
though i did not turn my back to him-
and ordered my men to make our own fire
at a little distance from that of the rodri-
guez crowd

  i was not yet through with talking to
him for i intended to say a good deal more
about that girl-stealing before he should go
on down the river but just then he
offended me as would something rotten
i felt like breathing cleaner air why i
should feel so i do not know for i am used
to rough-things and woman-stealing was
nothing new in the rio negro country
perhaps it was because i liked maquiritares
and disliked rodriguez

  looking over at them from my own fire

i	saw that the girl could not keep her eyes
off me rodriguez saw it too and growled
at her then when she still watched me
he gave her a shove that threw her on her
back she rolled over and rose to her feet
in one quick move and for an instant she
stood looking dumbly at him cursing he
lunged at her again with another swift
movement she dodged him and then she
dashed around him and came running
straight to me

  ha said i to myself this makes it
much more simple

  the girl had puzzled me a little until
now she had given no sign of dislike for
rodriguez and it is always possible that
when a woman is carried off by a man-she
is not very unwilling and in that case an-
other man is likely to make a fool of himself
by interfering but now she was fleeing
	adventure

                                                       

from him to me for protection-and i was
very glad to give it to her

  in no time at all she was beside me and
looking me in the eye and pointing back
at him she shook her head i gave her a
nod and pushed her behind me then i
waited for rodriguez to act

  he stared his mouth twisting in muttered
oaths then his face black he came walk-
ing swiftly toward us cocking his gun as he
strode over the sand whether he would
have had the courage to attack me at the
end i never shall know he never reached
me

  a sudden rush sounded in the dense bush
beyond the sand no life had made itself
known in that green tangle since i landed
but now it appeared with the suddenness
of a squall out on the sand bounded
human tigers coming with the speed of the
storm-wind

  rodriguez halted in mid-stride his feet
wide apart for a second he seemed para-
lyzed then with a hoarse cry of fear he
swung his gun and fired without aim and
that was the end of him

  the brown men were on him machetes
gleamed in the sun-light there was a
chop-chop-chop of blades a crunching
sound of bones split and severed a horrible
bubbling gasp then rodriguez disap-
peared i could see only a little ring of
maquiritares a blur of red steel rapidly
swinging up and down

  chop-chop-chop-chop then silence
the bush-knives were still some one
grunted it was the first human sound the
indians had made since they burst from
the trees

  they looked swiftly around at the mes-
tizos of rodriguez who still were paralyzed
and at us then their eyes blazing their
skins smeared with great gouts of red their
machetes dripping they walked steadily
toward us

  ramon rodriguez was gone where he
had last stood was a crimson mess which
was not a man nor even parts of a man
a hash of cloth and hair and meat that was
only a hideous blob on the clean sand

  watching those grim-faced killers ad-
vance on us i cocked my rifle and braced
myself

  	alto a hi i commanded halt where
you are

  they came straight on but one spoke
in spanish

  we know you loco leon you are a
friend

  at once i lowered the gun since they
recognized me i was in no danger a few
steps more and they stopped beside me
after looking a minute at the young woman
who had come from behind me they turned
their eyes again to me

  why are you here asked one

  i come to visit the maquiritares i an-
swered how do you know me
none of my padamo friends are among
you

  we heard you talk with ramon we
heard your name we have heard of loco
leon

  i see you now go back to your
paragua

   it is so

  i go with you

   it is good

  the paddlers of rodriguez were sneaking
now to their canoe the maquiritares
turned and watched them but made no
move toward them i called to them

  you need not run these men would
have killed you before now if they intended
to do so wait and you shall have com-
panions

  to my own crew i said

  you had best leave me here go back
to san fernando with those men i will
pay you now	

   they were only too glad to leave me after
what they had just seen for they knew that
though loco leon might be welcome among
those killers they themselves had no such
welcome and i too knew that i should be
better off without them it had been my
intention to send them back as soon as my
curial should reach the maquiritare settle-
ment as my further movements were to be
made with the knowledge of the indians
alone now it was best for all that i get
rid of them here

  so i paid them and they crowded into
the rodriguez canoe at once the double
crew pushed out and shot down-stream
turning their heads for one last look at the
awful thing that had been ramon then
they were gone

  once more i am among my friends i
said it is good

  and the maquiritares their hard eyes
on the fragments of the man who had out-
raged their tribe echoed-

   it is good
the thirty gang



v

bin sending away my mestizos
i had of course relied on the in-
dians to carry me onward to their
settlement for any other bianco than loco
leon this would have been a very poor time
indeed to hope for aid from the cunucu-
numa men and in spite of my well-known
friendship toward all the maquiritare na-
tion not even i should have been sure of a
welcome just then if i had not known that
those men had seen and heard what took
place before they broke from the bush

  as it was they had convincing proof that
i was no friend of rodriguez and that i
had stood ready to defend the girl from him
and now without waiting for me to ask
them they manned my curial as coolly as
if they had come there for that purpose

  we got away at once for i had lost
my appetite-perhaps because thjfee black
zamuros had already dropped from the sky
to attend to what remained of ramon-
and the indians having completed the little
job for which they had come there saw
no sense in lingering there were about a
dozen of them and half entered my canoe
while the rest with the girl disappeared
into the bush first though every man
bathed himself and his machete scrubbing
off the blood of rodriguez as if it were
pollution

  a few rods up-stream we found among
rocks on the eastern shore the two canoes
in which the avengers had followed the
woman-stealer until they smelt his smoke
we did not pause the others would bring
the boats on with paddle and pole my
new men forced the curial northward far
faster than my mestizos would have moved
it for they knew every current and every
channel among the raudales and they were
determined to reach their tribe-house before
night

  in all that afternoon i said no word to
try to give them orders about the work
would have been foolish and they spoke of
nothing else at first they were moody and
silent but after a while the river-work drove
all other thoughts from their minds and
they became such good-humored fellows as
maquiritares usually are

  whenever one of them slipped and fell
into the water as happened more than once
in a raudal the rest laughed at him like a
crowd of boys and when the following

canoes appeared at times behind us there
was calling back and forth between crews
to any man not well acquainted with their
ways it would have seemed impossible that
those merry young men could show such
ferocity as they had vented on rodriguez

  sunset brought us to the paragua of
yaracuma capitdn of the maquiritares of
the cunucunuma as we drew up at the
bank another canoe came driving down-
stream and swung in to tie beside ours in
it were several indians all of whom looked
curiously at me but seemed undisturbed by
the coming of a new white

  one of them older than the rest had a
quiet air of authority which told me he was
the chief and the bodies of several baquidos
wild hogs in the canoe showed that he had
been on a hunt i began to understand now
something which had puzzled me-why
yaracuma had not led his men when they
chased rodriguez he had been away when
the crime of ramon took place

  this proved true my paddlers at once
told him of what had come about and for
a minute he glared like an angry tigre but
then learning that the girl was safe and
ramon cut to pieces he gave a grunt of
satisfaction when he was told who i was
he grunted again and studied me sharply
then the other two canoes from down-
stream arrived he asked the girl a few ques-
tions which she answered quietly and in
the first darkness of night we all climbed
the slope to the tribe-house

  there i was led into the big central room
where the men always gather and there
yaracuma called a couple of names two
young fellows came forward grinning at me
and i recognized them as men who once
had gathered my balata on the padamo

  como stuste loco leon they greeted
me how are you

  bien i answered y ustedes

  bien

  they kept on grinning but said no more
i looked at yaracuma and we both smiled
for we understood each other although
he had been told who i was he wanted to
see with his own eyes that i was recognized
as loco leon by men who knew loco leon
there was no longer any chance of doubt

  soon we ate and then we talked as the
killing of rodriguez was the most important
subject we talked first of that and now i
learned more about how ramon had cap-
tured his woman in their tale to the chief
l

adventure

his men had spoken their own dialect which
is so queer that i never have learned more
than a few words of it but yaracuma
spoke fair spanish and he told me what
he knew of the matter

  ramon had not taken her from her peo-
ple in the bold way he wanted me to be-
lieve he had stayed at the tribe-house
several days saying he came to make sure
that the maquiritares would be ready to
work again for rivero in the next wet
season

  there was nothing strange about that
except that it was very early for him to
make such a trip he had tried several
times to talk to the young woman but she
had avoided him and he had laughed loud-
ly as if it were only a joke so though the
men kept an eye on him and hoped he would
go soon none was disturbed about it

  this morning she and several other girls
had gone as usual to the plantation half
a mile away in order to dig yuca roots for
the making of cassava ramn had sud-
denly decided to return to the orinoco and
he had gone down-stream in his canoe but
while the girls were busy at their work and
the one who had taken his fancy was a little
away from the others he suddenly jumped
out from the trees grabbed her stopped her
mouth and dragged her away

  the other girls did not see this done and
it was some time before they succeeded in
puzzling out what had taken place then
they returned to the paragua where they
found that most of the men were out hunt-
ing and fishing before the pursuit could
start ramon had time to travel a long
way but the pursuers went fast after they
did start and ramons own foolishness in
stopping ended whatever chance he might
have had

  i smoked awhile after hearing this and
i saw something which i knew must be also
in the mind of yaracuma the two crews-
mine and that of rodriguez-would travel
fast down the river to san fernando and
there they would tell of what the indians
had done and rivero and all his friends
would be enraged-not at rodriguez but
at the maquiritares

  to most men of the wild territorio de
amazonas an indian is a dog to be beaten
or shot or outraged at will he has no rights
and no protection and he is a creature made
only for the use and abuse of the white
man and for him to defend himself and

avenge his wrongs is a crime calling for
death-and not always a quick death so
now with the town full of men who de-
lighted in murder it would be odd if an
armed gang did not soon appear on the
cunucunuma to teach the indian dogs a
lesson

  it was quite likely indeed that those
killers would start even before the crews
should reach san fernando for if the
mestizos should meet paco the butcher-
which was not at all improbable-they
would tell him all they knew and paco
probably would come up the orinoco at
once it would be just such work as he
and his gang would like a chance to kill me
for pay to butcher the indian men for sport
and to enslave the maidens for pleasure

  yaracuma did not yet know about paco
and i decided not to tell about him for
awhile it might not be necessary to speak
of him at all i was quite sure i knew what
thought was in the chiefs mind and i was
willing to let that thought grow without
forcing it too much

  do you come to work the balata here
he asked after a time

  no this is not so good a place as my
own river i come to visit the cunucunuma
men and then go on to my ventuari

  it is a long journey

  not so long for loco leon the rover
i do not go back by the orinoco if my
friends here will help me overland

  he looked thoughtfully at me

  how do you go he asked

  i have heard that there is a pass through
the mountains from the cunucunuma to tie
iurebe i explained down the iurebe
to the ventuari is not far so i reach the
ventuari well above the boca and go on to
my sitio near the fall of quencua and i
have seen new country

  it is so he said and thought awhile
longer it was well known that in the dry
time i was a rambler of the wilds always
seeking something new so it did not seem
very odd to him that i proposed this over-
land journey

  but the way is hard he added and
you have much weight to carry

  si i have just come from down the
great river and i bring many things there
are good presents among them for all my
maquiritare friends who help me across
he was silent for several minutes i
decided to help him think
the thirty gang



  how long have the people of yaracuma
lived on the cunucunuma i asked

  many moons

  ever since i was on the padamo

  yes

  is it not a long time for maquiritares to
live in one place

  a long time

  is not this a good time to move to some
other river

  he agreed so quickly that i knew my
guess as to his thoughts had been right

  it is so we have lived too long on the
cunucunuma i it is no longer a good place
for us

  the ventuari is a god river i sug-
gested it has much game and fish there
are other maquiritares on the ventuari
the people of yaracuma are too much alone
here and now there will be no more balata
work on the cunucunuma if the men of
yaracuma would like to bleed the balata
another year and have new knives and
machetes beads and clothy matches and
fish-hooks and other things they can get
them all on the ventuari i loco leon
can give all those things

  the men squatting around or sitting in
hammocks gave a murmur they knew as
well as yaracuma and i that they must
move or live in dread and die in hopeless
battle for fight as they might with arrow
and blow-gun and spear they could not win
against the bullets of the merciless men who
almost certainly would come

  and here was loco leon friend of all
maquiritares arriving at their time of need
to point out the way to a safer land and
treat them well after they entered it it
was great luck for the people of yaracuma
they did not know it was greater luck for
loco leon

  yaracuma considered it awhile however
in his deliberate indian way and i knew
better than to expect an immediate answer
he was still thinking about it when i curled
up in my hammock and went to sleep or
perhaps he had already decided and was
thinking about the travel-plans at any
rate i heard nothing more from him about
it until morning

  then as calmly as if the abandonment of
home and crops and the passage of his whole
tribe over the mountains were things done
every day he said

  the people of yaracuma go to the

iurebe

   

  it is good i said as if it meant nothing
to me

  every woman was put to work at once
in making cassava evefy man made the
necessary preparations for the journey and
three days later with everything worth
carrying packed in the canoes and every-
thing else destroyed-except the house it-
self-we pushed away up the cunucunuma
behind us the big paragua stood empty of
all life never again to be used by the men
of yaracuma yet though the house itself
would tell nothing to those who should
come later it held a message for the butcher

  one of the indians had killed a big red
areguato the day before we went and when
it was brought in a foolish idea came to me
so telling the maquiritares that we would
leave a monkey to plague our enemies i
had them stuff the skin with leaves sew it
up and fasten one of its hands in a position
which in our country is a mortal insult
from man to man then as we were leav-
ing we hung that ribald thing in the door-
way facing the river and from its neck
i slung a slip of paper on which i had
written

el carnicero

   hdgame v el favor de irse al diablo

   con la bids distinguida consideracidn su afmo

loco leon 

 when a maquiritare tells you
senores that a journey is hard you
may believe that it is hard those
sons of the jungled mountains and rocky
rivers give little thought to a trip that would
make a white man consider twice true
they are not in the habit of carrying heavy
burdens and any well-hardened man can
traverse bad ground when he has no weight
on his back but weight or no weight you
can always be sure that any journey in their
country is much more difficult than they
say it is

  so warned both by yaracumas hesita-
tion and by my own knowledge of the land
to the eastward near the padamo i now
looked for no easy trip i knew that not
far to the east were such huge masses as
the cerro duida which shoots up into the
air for more than a mile and maravaca
whose top is at least two miles above the

  butcher kindly go to the - most sincerely

              t

orinoco and that westward were other
great mountain-blocks what lay ahead i
did not know but i was quite sure it would
be rough and it was

  through raudal after raudal we toiled
until at last the canoes could go no farther
then we took to our legs every one of us
bore a burden except the children too
young to carry anything but themselves
the men were loaded with my belongings
and their own the women and girls with
baskets of food or with babies progress
was slow but it was steady and every
sunset found us higher among the hills and
nearer to the ventuari

  we passed the unknown cerro cucha-
macari and kept on to the north we strug-
gled through a maze of cliff-blocks and
slanted to the northwest following the line
of the high pass between queneveba and
queneveta we sweat by day and froze by
night unprotected from the cold of the
lofty hills we ate all our food and lived
on what we could kill-and we killed
anything that moved birds beasts snakes
toads

  we paused only to eat to rest and to
burn our dead-for more than one death
came about especially among the children
yet there was no murmuring against the
hardships of the traverse for man woman
and child knew what would have befallen
the whole tribe if it had remained on the
cunucunuma after the death of rodriguez
became known

  in those days there was little laughter or
light talk for our bodies grew too tired and
out stomachs too empty to let us think of
jokes nor were there many signs of com-
radeship among men or of affection between
man and woman unless the action of a
father in sharing food with his woman and
children could be called so every one
carried his or her own load and women
killed any small thing to eat just as the
men did

  yet though i provided for myself and
expected no aid from the maquiritares under
such conditions i began to find that there
was one who seemed always to be near me
whenever we stopped that one was the
girl whom i had intended to protect from
rodriguez

  with my rifle i was able at times to knock
over more meat than i could eat all at once
and so i gave what i could spare to those
who happened to be at hand and since

the girl-who was called nama-usually
was close by she got food when i had it
once i laughed at her and said

 you are a wise young woman you
know where to get your meals

  she smiled slowly for she did not under-
stand me she knew no spanish i forgot
the matter very soon and whenever i saw
her near me i thought she was merely look-
ing for a few mouthfuls of meat but then
came a day when i shot nothing at all and
the maquiritares had only half enough for
themselves so that i went hungry and
while i was making new holes in my belt
and trying to forget how empty i was
nama came to me

  no tengo nadai grumbled only half-
looking at her i have nothing go

  but she stepped up to me and held some-
thing forward i took it and she went away
at once it was a little bag of platani leaf
tied with bush-cord and hot-just brought
from the edge of a fire and when i opened
it inside i found five baked tree-toads

  i was so much astonished that i squatted
there staring as if i had never seen such
things i must have looked rather foolish
for when i glanced up i found several of the
maquiritare men grinning the girl was
nowhere in sight

  so i ate the little hoppers and though
they made a scant meal for a hungry man
my stomach stopped complaining the
tired men grinned again at me and i
grinned back making a joke of it for loco
leon rover and killer of the biggest game
to be fed on toads by a woman really was
a rich joke to the maquiritares but when
i lay back in my hammock and thought it
over it did not seem so funny to me

  it began to look as if the young woman
had been lingering near me for another
reason than that of getting food i remem-
bered how steadily she had looked at me
when she first saw me and how she had run
to me from rodriguez without knowing
who i was-for it was hardly likely that
the name loco leon meant anything to
het just then

  at that time i had thought she stared
because i looked odd and came to me only
to escape from the roughness of ramon
but now i was not so sure that was all of it

  i do not pretend to know how the mind
of a woman works but i am not blind and
this was a most unusual thing for a ma-
quiritare maiden to do
the thirty gang



  it did not give me any worriment for my
safety either then or later for the maquiri-
tare hien were not likely to make any objec-
tion even to my taking her as my woman
if she and i both felt inclined to have it so
i was no ramon rodriguez nor even a
stray bianco traveler who soon would leave
their land i was as nearly one of their own
nation as any white man could be who did
not actually live the indian life and i was
trusted and respected

  if i wished to do so sefiores i have no
doubt that i could take not only one but
three or four of those fair-skinned indian
girls to my siiio as my wives without losing
the friendship of the maquiritares but if
i did that i should lose sme of their respect
and more of my own respect for loco leon
i am no better than other men but i am a
little too proud of my white blood to wish
to become a-what do you say-ah yes
a squaw-man

  so the thing bothered me a little and i
decided that nama must not be allowed to
develop any useless ideas about me and
since i did not wish to hurt her or to make
others laugh at her it seemed that the best
way was simply to appear blind to treat
her like any one else but otherwise to
ignore her and that was what i did

  it happened that the next day i killed
a tapir so that there was much meat to be
given out i cut it up myself and to nama
who was near as usual i gave no more than
to the others nor did i do more than glance
at her as she took it later though when
the flesh was cooked she brought me the
tenderest part of her portion i acted sur-
prized showed her that i had plenty of meat
of my own and refused her offering

  she looked a little disappointed but ate
it herself without further sign of feeling
and from that time on she offered me noth-
ing for that matter i always managed to
provide something for myself after that-
good poor or bad but always some-
thing

  then we reached the iurebe it was a
mere thread of water among rocks at that
point but it was the end of our hard life
in the highlands we had only to work
down along it in almost open country kill-
ing plenty of game in the woods beside the
stream sleeping warm at night and joking
about the rage of the san fernando men
who might even now be on the cunu-
cunuma they never would find our trail

for we had journeyed on the river for days
after leaving the tribe-house

   even if they did find it they would not
dare to follow it it was too perilous a road

  yaracuma and his people still did not
know that paco the butcher was on the
ventuari and i still did not tell them it
was quite possible that he was no longer
there that he had gone up the orinoco
and the joy of those hard-worn people on
reaching their promised land was such that
i had not the heart to spoil it with news of
another danger

   after they had rested awhile at a place
half-way down the stream where the water
was deep enough to hold many fish and the
bush was alive with baquido and pauji and
other fine game they became a merry
crowd the young men sported like boys
the women laughed as they played with the
babies yaracuma himself talked smilingly
of the new home they intended to build
in the uplands above quencua-and the
girl nama hung closer than ever to me
saying nothing but looking long with her
deep dark eyes 

  then the men began to talk of felling
trees and burning out new canoes to carry
us all up the ventuari but i had been
thinking about this and decided against it
such work meant much smoke which might
be seen far and though i believed paco had
gone before now he might be nearer than i
thought

  the mouth of the iurebe was only two
days journey up from that of the ventuari
and i remembered that only a little way
below it was a rocky point which would be
a good place to watch the river in both
directions for all i knew the butcher
might now be at that very point and i had
not brought these people so far to lead them
to slaughter

   so without giving any reason except that
my plan meant less work-which is always 
a good reason to indians-i proposed an-
other idea

  between here and my sitio below the
fall of quencua i said the land is open
sabana across that saban-a some of the
young men can walk easily in a few days
carrying no weights i can give them a
paper showing how the river runs and where
the canos are and where the sun rises and
by that they can go straight to quencua
at my sitio they will find good canoes lying
idle and to men of mine who always are


adventure

there they can give my orders and this ring
which they know

  i showed them this ring senores which
as you see has the head of a gold ledn with
emerald eyes

  then the canoes can come to us here in
five days or less i went on and instead
of working we shall rest and hunt and
grow fat while we wait is the plan good
yaracuma

  the chief agreed that it was

  then let it be done i said but first
let us send scouts to the mouth of this
stream to look about and make sure that
no men of san fernando are near to harm
the people of yaracuma it is not likely
but it is always best to be sure

  yaracuma agreed again and the next
morning several of the men were sent to
the ventuari after they left some of the
other indians looked rather soberly at me
but i gave no sign that i expected the scouts
to find any one so they thought no more of it
and in the three days before the absent men
returned there was no anxiety about them

 when they did come though they
brought news on the ventuari they had
found no sign of any enemy but on the
iurebe about one days march down from our
halting-place they had come upon a camp

  it seemed to have been used by a hunting-
party which had left not long before our
men arrived there bones of wild hogs and
turkeys were there and the camp was such
as might have been made by themselves
it had a maquiritare look to their eyes but
it puzzled them because this iurebe was
not in the maquiritare but in the maco
country also there was a hut and the
maquiritares usually do not make huts for
short stays at a place in the dry season

  something about the hut made the scouts
think it had been used by a white man and
a woman and in the bush not far from the
camp they had found what was left of a
dead iigrs and near it a couple of cartridge-
ohells these shells they had brought to me

  both were bottle-necked rifie-shells and
both were of caliber 

vii

as soon as i studied those brass
tubes i thought of black white
so far as i knew his was the only
rifle of that size in all our guayana country
the white-man house described by the

maquiritares too seemed likely to be his
the woman who shared it with him would
be juana his indian shadow but that he
should be down here in the maco country
so far from the parima highlands of the
caura and the carom where he usually
wandered looked queer

  yet as i thought about it it did not ap-
pear so puzzling for el blanco negro was
restless as a tigre and if he decided to tramp
down into this region there was no good
reason why he should not certainly it
was nothing to cause any concern to us
if the shells had been  and the camp had
not looked to be that of indians we might
have had cause to look sharply about us

  whether yaracuma who had lived so far
from other maquiritares knew anything
of black white i was not sure but i found
that he did

  el blanco negro i said holding up the
shells

  si he answered quietly his face did
not change but i felt that he was relieved
i asked him then if he had ever seen black
white and he gave me no reply at all
this did not annoy me for i had long been
used to this silence of all maquiritares con-
cerning the white man who had been
changed into an unwilling member of their
nation it was quite clear that the cunu-
cunuma men knew of him and that was
answer enough

  i though it as well however to tell yara-
cuma that i too knew that man that i had
been with him when his skin was changed
and that sometimes since then he had
visited me the capitdn and the others
who understood spanish listened with in-
terest and later i saw them talking with
the rest in their own language looking now
and then at me

  then we sent away our messengers to
quencua with a small map which i care-
fully explained and with my lean ring and
orders to my quencua men eight young
fellows set out at sunrise carrying only
their weapons hammocks and some roasted
quarters of baquido yaracuma gave them
strict commands to let nothing delay them
we watched them swing away northeast-
ward and disappear among the rolling
knolls and then we too moved

  down the iurebe we traveled walking
in the sabana beyond the tree-line of the
stream and taking our time-for the canoes
could not reach this water for more than a
the thirty gang



week in this easy journeying along
through the open where i had a chance to
look at other things than what was just
ahead i noticed that the girl nama some-
times walked and talked with a well-built
young fellow near her own age and i was
glad of it she had seen her mistake i
thought-although she still stayed near me
at the stopping-places she would mate
with this young man probably when the
new paragua had been built so i gave no
more thought to her

  at the deserted camp reported by our
scouts we stopped for alright finding noth-
ing new it was just as they had described
it and we saw no sign to show why its
makers had come or where they had gone
the next day we left it and journeyed on
when we reached a place which we judged
to be half a day from the ventuari we baited
and made a camp where we could wait for
canoes to come to us

  in this lazy walk we had used up as much
time as it had taken our scouts to travel
all the way to the ventuari and return with
their report-three days the canoes from
quencua could not reach us for several
more days i grew restless and decided
to go on a tramp

  off to the northeast perhaps a days
march away across the sabana i had noticed
a rugged cerro shaped somewhat like a mans
fist standing up boldly against the sky
and near it i knew must flow the little
cano paro where hunting should be good
so warning yaracuma to keep on using
only the driest wood for cooking in order
to avoid smoke i set out with several of
the younger maquiritares who felt as rest-
less as i

  we moved about for four days finding
the hunting no better than on the iurebe
indeed we did not care so much aboit kill-
ing animals as about killing time so we
gave less attention to the cano than to the
hill near it and in rambling around that
cerro we found at its base another camp
like that on our own stream

  no cartridge-shells were there and the
camp was not so good as the other yet
the maquiritares after looking it all over
very carefully said it had been used by the
same people and that it was at least as old
as the first one we had found probably a
irtle older black white and his little
-u-ty-if they were the camp-makers-
eemed to have made these places while

heading southwest and they had not yet
come back

  it gave us something to talk about and
that was all but on the morning of the
fifth day something new made us not only
talk but act in the southwestern sky ris-
ing from the point where we had left yara-
cuma and the rest of his tribe rose a tower
of black smoke

  the maquiritares stared and muttered
and i scowled and swore had yaracuma
become a fool or had the butcher found
them slaughtered them burned their camp
or perhaps had the canoes arrived and
was this a signal for us to come in we
did not know but we started at once for
the iurebe

  i told the fastest man in the little party
to push ahead as swiftly as possible leaving
with us everything but his bow and a few
arrows and learn what was taking place
the rest of us held to a steady rapid walk

  the smoke kept rising hour after hour
too steadily to be that of a destroyed camp
i concluded that yaracuma either had de-
cided to call us in or had tired of waiting
for the quencua boats and was burning out
logs to make dugouts of his own in either
case i cursed him for an idiot yet i had
to scold myself as well for i had given him
no good reason to suppose that any enemy
was near

  about mid-day the smudge died away
we were traveling faster on this day than
when we had left the iurebe and already
we had put behind us much more than half
of the return journey by this time per-
haps our runner had reached the cano we
kept on without a pause to eat gnawing
at chunks of cooked meat as we walked
and about the middle of the afternoon we
approached the camp

  the runner had not come back but now
as we slowed and spread out in order to
come upon the little settlement quietly
several men of yaracumas emerged from
the edge of the bush and walked toward us
as if they had been waiting they showed
no hurry or concern and when they came
near they grinned

  what is wrong i demanded

  nothing all is well one answered

  then why was all the smoke

  el capitdn said to make it

  but why

  they only grinned again i bit my tongue
to keep from swearing i knew that the


adventure

more i might rave the more they would grin
and the hotter i should grow and after
that long fast walk i was hot enough i
saved my remarks for yaracuma

 but though the men who had met us
would give me no satisfaction they told
something in their own tongue to the
maquiritares with me my companions
grunted and all looked up-stream i looked
also of course but saw nothing new and
then we entered the trees

  at the camp i found yaracuma and the
rest all looked a little amused when i
demanded why that smoke had been sent up

  it is nearly time for the boats yara-
cuma answered calmly

  diablol do i not know it i snapped
but they are not yet here and why in
el infierno do you blacken the sky

  it is time for my men to be here

  porque for what there is nothing
to do do you tell all the world you are
here because you want these men to squat
and look at you

  they are men of yaracuma yaracuma
wants them here

  i was angry enough to choke him but
it was true that they were his men not
mine and he seemed to be enjoying my
rage the others too looked as if they saw
a joke in the matter so i shut my mouth
turned my back on them all and went to
my usual sleeping-place hung my hammock
there and took a cooling bath at the edge
of the water then i lay and rested for
an hour watching them and listening to
talk which i could not understand

  they were speaking of something which
seemed to concern me for they looked my
way at times but whatever it was it was
nothing about which they were worried
and i was quite sure that if they knew of
any danger to me they would tell me of
it at once

  it seemed though that something or
some one was missing the place looked
unchanged so i glanced at the faces of men
and women-and then i knew what was
lacking the girl nama was nowhere in
sight and she had not been near me since
my return i had become so used to seeing
her standing about and watching me that
now i missed her just as i should miss a
tree or a stone or any other thing which
usually stood in a certain place the young
man with whom i had seen her talking at
times also was gone

  perhaps they have mated already i
thought and made a little hut in the bush
where they can be away from the rest a few
days bueno may their first-born be a
strong boy

  and i laughed and forgot them in specu-
lation about where my canoes now were

  then came the evening meal and the
usual noises of birds and beasts of the bush
at the end of the day and night and a half-
moon little fires burned here and there
to keep off tigres and it was time for all to
swing in their hammocks and sleep but
though many lay down none slept yet
there was talking and some of the men
squatted by the fires as if all were expect-
ing something

  i wondered of course what this meant
but i would not ask questions i had a
fire of my own which had been made by
some of the maquiritare boys and it seemed
larger than usual and too bright i let it
burn though and lay drowsily looking at
it and thinking of various things one of
those things was black white marching
across this down-river country and heading
southwest possibly i thought he might
stop at my sitio below quencua when he
came back and there we should have an-
other of those queer talks in which i never
saw him

  and while i was thinking of this some
one moved among the trees behind me i
gave little attention to the movement it
was  only some cunucunuma man i
thought but the soft footsteps came
nearer then stopped i turned then for
i always like to know who stands at my
back

  there quite clear in the light of the fire
was nama

  she stood looking at me and on her face
was a little smile i started to speak but
i remembered that she knew no spanish
so i said nothing then from behind her
sounded the voice of another woman speak-
ing my own language

  buen noche loco len it said

  quien es i asked squinting past nama
but seeing nobody

 juana de uaunana answered the
voice

 juana i echoed the woman of
black white buen noche juanal donde
estd el blanco where is white

  est aqui she replied he is here

  and from a dark place a few feet to the

right broke a harsb voice which i knew well

  evening loco talk english to me
talk

          viii

usually when the voice of black
white comes out of the night to me
in that sudden way i lie back in my
hammock and talk until i feel that he is
gone i know his mind is not quite right
his temper is fierce and his hands hold a
rifle also that he comes not to talk but
to listen to hear the language of his own
lost land it is a pitiful thing too senores
this english-hunger of his and gun or no
gun i should be a dog to deny him so small
a comfort

  yet on this night t felt that the talking
should not be all on my side for there were
things i wished to know and instead of
obliging him at once as usual i made a
bargain with him

  good evening white i hope you are
well i said i will talk gladly and tell
you all i know but this time you must
talk too i wish to learn a few things
talk - you was the savage an-
swer his rifle-hammer clicked

  not unless you talk in return i refused
that is only fair if you will not and if
you want to shoot me now and kill your
last chance to hear english-then shoot
and have it done

  with that i lit a cigarrillo and blew smoke
  he growled something then he agreed
  all right that goes now talk

  so i began

  i gave him the story of what had come
about at san fernando and of what i had
heard about paco peldom i went on to
speak of my journey to the cunucunuma
and of the end of ramon rodriguez and the
movement of the people of yaracuma from
their old paragua to the iurebe then as
he still listened i told of our trip to the
ccrro in the northeast of finding his camp
and of the smoke which had called us back
when i stopped he knew the whole tale
of my recent travels

  he seemed to give more attention to the
things i told him than to the way in which
those events were told when i described
the deaths of argel and rodriguez he
chuckled hoarsely and when i mentioned
the monkey i had left for the butcher to
swear at he laughed it was not a pleasant
laugh to hear but it showed he was amused

never before had i know him to show such
interest in what i said but at length i
learned that there was a reason for this
that all he asked when i was done
that is all i think of now and i have
talked a long time i said now tell me-
was it you who sent up that smoke today
and why

  not me but i told this man yaracuma
i wanted to see you he got you that way
i see and you waited until- night at
some place above here some man of yara-
cuma came and told you i had arrived is
it so

  he grunted an indian yes

  you have been to the mouth of the
ventuari i went on

  again he grunted

  did you find any gang there

  not the one you mean your butcher
is gone saw his camp

  that is good then yaracuma is not
the fool i thought him but how come you
here so far from the high hills

  had some killing to do had to come
here to do it

  como how is that

  there was no answer for a minute then
i heard him growl a few words feet moved
toward me from some place a little farther
back they stopped and again came the
growl and still i saw only nama

takes too many words black white
grumbled then this man will tell you
another grunt and then sounded a new
voice that of a maquiritare man speaking
spanish

loco this was the way of this thing
there came into our country a bad man
from the orinoco he came up the caura
he went toward san fernando his name
was bayona

  oho i muttered i knew this bayona
an ugly overbearing brute who called him-
self coronel and who worked balata when
he could get men-which was only when he
could catch them his name was so bad
that it was known not only to the maquiri-
tares but to other indian tribes to the
puinabes and the banivas west and south
of san fernando and even to the yaviteros
and the bares still farther away

  during the last wet season he had
gathered a rubber crop by making slaves
of some banivas and driving them like
beasts killing half of them before the dry
time ended the work and he had taken


adventure

this crop down the river to caicara gnd
sold it there knowing that if he dared show
his face in bolivar he would be imprisoned
for old crimes from caicara to the caura
is not far and i soon learned why he had
gone up the caura

  bayona brought with him other bad
men the indian went on they had guns
and many bullets they came suddenly
and caught men and women of our nation
they did not go to big places like uaunana
they struck small paraguas where fighters
were few they shot and killed and made
slaves of men they did vile things to
women and girls they would take the
men down the ventuari and keep them until
the rains come then they would make
them work balata

  the men who tried to run away were
tortured at the cano estuca we found a
dead maquiritare tied to a tree he had
been beaten dead many broken sticks
were around him he was a strong man
it would take half a day of beating to kill
him so

  el blanco was far away when bayona
came he was at the caronl but the word
of what bayona was doing reached to him
we turned west and followed bayona

  we visited the paraguas of the ventuari
and learned all bayona had done we drove
our canoes to the falls of oso bayona was
days ahead el blanco said we must leave
the river and march straight through the
sabana to the ventuari mouth we walked
this sabana we walked straight while
bayona delayed to pass raudales or to hunt
we reached the delta

  then bayona came in a canoe the
slaves walked driven by men with guns
we were on both sides of the river when
the slaves came we killed the men with the
guns el blanco killed bayona

  we left alive only one man of bayona
the slaves said that man had not been so
bad to them we put him in the canoe of
bayona and let him go

  before he went we fed bayona to the
caribe fishes we told that man to tell other
blancos not to bother the maquiritares if
they do they will be made food for fish
he went away very fast

  we go back to our hills the maquiri-
tares who were slaves are free bayona and
his men are dead it is good

  the voice was still for a minute all was
very quiet then from all about us rose a

deep hum of the voices of men who had
heard and understood

  es buenol they echoed it is good

  and i too knowing what i knew of ba-
yona rejoiced as i heard of his end

  si it is good i said even if the

-does nothing more to bayona than to

torment him as he tormented his poor vic-
tims here it will take a long time to square
the account and the men of san fer-
nando now will think twice before they
visit the ventuari again yet there may
be more trouble because you let that one
man go white bayona was a friend of
funes

  a harsh laugh came out of the bush

  to - with funes jeered whites

voice he can come himself if hes got
the guts we take all comers

  you had better get some guns before
you say that i told him he has an
army of guapos and many guns brought
from brazil i do not see how you even
managed to kill bayona and his men with
only your one gun the arrows of your
men are poor weapons against bullet

  another laugh came and this time more
than one throat made that laugh the in-
dians too were chuckling as if they had a
joke on me but nobody explained what
the joke might be and as before i would
not ask what amused them

  feet began to move again feet in that
place where el blanco negro and his men
had stood they were going only nama
still stood there looking at me in that
patient way of hers i knew white was
leaving me as he always did without a
farewell and i gave him no adios with my
eyes on the girl but my thoughts on what
i had heard i spoke to her in a careless way
forgetting for the moment that she did not
know spanish

  where have you been nama i asked

  she only smiled as if she would like to
please me by answering if she could but
the receding footsteps of white and his
men stopped

  got a woman now have you loco
mocked whites voice farther out than it
had been you fool oh you fool ha-
ha-ha

  no i snapped back i have no wo-
man this girl is not mine

  oh dont lie he sneered shes yours
all over shes been talking loco leon all
day to my woman juana loco leon
the thirty gang



nothing but loco leon ashamed of her
are you when another white man calls on

you

  i tell you sefior she is nothing to me
i disputed believe what you like but i
speak truth

  he was still for a minute then he

said

  watch yourself then hombre shes
after you hard first thing you know shell
feed you some of that red yucut sehi that
turns you black youll be a nigger-white
like me a dead man like me dead
dead dead like el blanco negro a
dead man walking in the night ha-ha-
lia-ha

  his laugh now was mad a terrible sound
that sent a chill crawling over me the
leaves began rustling again and i said no
word neither did any one else except
for that slight sound of movement every-
thing was silent the rustling died and
still the silence held then from some-
where out of the sabana sounded again that
horrible laugh and a wild yell

  two dead men now el blanco negro
and loco leon black black ah ha
ha-ha-ha-ha

  nama shuddered and crept closer
to me i too shuddered and made no
move

  black white was gone but he had left
behind him something that bothered me
that night and long after and it was not
the thought that further trouble might
come from the killing of coronel bayona

  i knew quite well-though i am sure
white never thought of it-that all the
blame for the bayona matter might fall
on me the man spared by the indians
probably knew only that a band of maquiri-
tares led by some man with a rifle had
done this killing on the ventuari

  to the people of san fernando black
white was only a name many believed him
to be only a creature of an indian tale not
a real man so i the only man with a rifle
known to live on the ventuari and likely
to lead maquiritares might at some time
have to pay funes for bayonas blood with
my own

  but as i say it was not this that kept me
thinking long after the people of yaracuma
slept or that made me cautious regarding
my drink and food for some time afterward

  for the first time in my life i was afraid
of a woman

rx

     whether black white and his
band of killers went straight out
maga int the sabana that night and trav-
eled homeward by moonlight or whether
they returned to some camp farther up the
iurebe i do not know from the moment
when they left me there in my hammock
i neither heard nor saw a sign of them the
next morning as i walked about in the open
and looked to south and east i could not
observe anything to show they had even
been there and i made no journey up the
stream asked no questions of the maquiri-
tares nor did any men of yaracuma leave
their own camp except for the usual
hunting

  as before i gave no outward attention
to nama she loitered around near me
whenever i was in camp but i pretended
not to see her yet i did more thinking
about her than ever before and as i have
said i was particular about what i drank
and ate i knew white had been made
black white by the girl juana i knew
nama had talked about me to juana i
knew nothing about what juana might have
advised this girl to do and in my head
kept echoing that last cry of the wild man
two dead men now el blanco negro
and loco leon black black

  yet nama did not try to bring me any
drink or to cook my meat and at times i
saw her speaking to the same young fellow
who had been with her before all went on
as it had been

  then came the canoes they reached us
about mid-day manned by the cunucu-
numa messengers who had gone overland
and by some of my own maquiritares who
lived all the year at my sitio to do my work
and care for my plantation from these
men of mine i learned that bayona had not
been seen at my place and that all was well
there they spent the rest of the day in
loading my supplies and the next morning
soon after dawn we all were afloat

  though every curial i own had been
brought down-and i keep a little fleet of
dugouts always at hand-they were too
few to carry all the tribe when every
boat was packed so that the water rose
almost to the gunwale there were still
seven men without a boat so they had to
take the land route to quencua just as the
messengers had done and they not only


adventure

reached my sitio safely but they were there
two days before us they carried no bur-
dens of course while we were heavily
loaded and held back by raudales and
currents

  on that journey of ours yaracuma and
his people had good proof that i had not
lied to them about the richness of my river

  they watched tapirs swimming in the
water or standing in their holes in the clay
banks peccaries coming down in file to
drink monkeys of every kind trooping in
the trees wild peacocks and turkeys sud-
denly appearing and vanishing in the bush
huge ducks floating on the green surface of
the stream

  they heard the soft moan of the pauji
day and night the trumpeting of the grulla
when the sun was high the rush and splash
of pabdn and other fish along every sandy
playa at sundown

  they saw the assehi palm and the aceite
palo trees which give drink and oil and the
carrana whose pitch makes torches and
fires and they were content

  they talked too with my maquiritares
learning of the up-river canos and the para-
guas of the indians already there yara-
cuma did not intend either to stay at my
place below quencua or to join any other
settlement he planned to make his new
home at the best place he could find and to
lose no time about it this much i learned
from my own men and i was well satisfied
to have it so it was better for them and
for me that they should go their own way
after e reached quencua

  by the time we landed at my sitio yara-
cuma had learned all my men could tell
him and that was all he could learn from
any man for i kept those maquiritares
partly because they knew the country so
well he said nothing about where he in-
tended to go though until after we had
reached my place and i had kept my prom-
ise to pay well for the carrying of my sup-
plies from the cunucunuma then when i
had given out the machetes and other things
his men had earned he gave me a surprize

  the men of the ventuari tell me- he
said that loco len will work the balata
at the cano de oso above the parima-the
high falling water

  it is so i agreed on the cano be-
yond the fall of oso my friends shall work

  and above the cano de oso is the calo
uaychamo

  it is so i repeated

  on the cano uaychamo shall be the
paragua of yaracuma he announced

  now this cano uaychamo is in the upper
sabana country and though it is well
wooded i had not thought of his making a
home there for the maquiritares like the
thick forests beyond the open lands for
their houses and i had expected him to go
there so i was astonished but i was well
pleased too for by this i knew yaracuma
intended to help me bleed my trees in the
next wet season

  you must understand senores that even
i for whom the maquiritares will do far
more than for any other man am never
sure of my workers from one season to
another they are free men and they do as
they please when they wish to work for
me they come to me when they would
rather stay at home or go on one of the
long roving trips of which they are fond or
move their whole tribe to some other place
they give no thought to me and my balata
why should they their lives are their
own not mine

  yet like any other man whose interests
depend on labor i like to know where that
labor is to come from and i saw that for
the next season at least i should have
willing workers near at hand in the cano
uaychamo men

  es bueno i told him i go soon to the
cano de oso and much farther up the
ventuari i shall walk about and see what
i may see as i do in each dry time let
yaracuma make his paragua and when the
rains fall we shall meet again

  it shall be so

  and the next morning at sunrise yara-
cuma and all his people left me with one
of my own maquiritares to keep them com-
pany and show them the shortest route
over the sabana they crossed the river in
my canoes and were gone in the trees lining
the bank the last one to fade from sight
was nama who after all the rest had disap-
peared stood a minute looking over the
water at me i gave no sign that i saw her
as my men shoved away and came paddling
my dugouts back to our own creek the girl
turned slowly and followed her people

  vaya con dios nama i said softly
go with god-and forget that you ever
saw me

  and i walked back to my house feeling
as if a load had been lifted from me until
the thirty gang

 

then i had not realized just how heavily
black whites warning had lain on my
mind

  now i turned my attention to preparing
for my usual rambling in the highlands
though i had already decided to gather
balata on the cano de oso there were
other creeks much farther up where i wished
to look about-for it is my custom to work
as many grounds in one season as i can
and i am always seeking new good dis-
tricts for use in future years

  so not being in the habit of leaving all
my supplies in ne house while away i now
had them placed in a number of secret
spots known only to me and my trusted
men then with two young maquiritares
who usually travel with me in the wilder-
ness i journeyed up the river to my next
sitio just above the cataract of oso

  all was well there and i moved on the
mouth of the uaychamo showed no sign of
life as i passed it but i knew well enough
that somewhere back from the ventuari-
perhaps a mile inland perhaps much far-
ther-the machetes which the cunucunuma
men had earned from me were swinging
steadily clearing ground and chopping poles
for the framework of their new paragua

  thinking of that i recalled their old
tribe-house on the cunucunuma and the
stuffed monkey hung in its doorway and
the insulting note to the butcher and as
we left the cano behind us i chuckled long
picturing paco frothing with curses and
hacking that monkey-skin to ribbons-in a
killing rage and with nothing to kill

  for weeks after that too i-amused my-
self with visions of the fury of that baffled
murderer then i stopped laughing very
suddenly

  i had gone about among the nearest
paraguas visiting the maquiritares and
telling them all was well on the ventuari
now that bayona was dead-though they
seemed to know all about that affair before
i met them-and i had done some scouting
for new balata when the word came that
made me a madman

  it reached me in a camp which i had
made on the little rio tamara south of the
ventuari which was full of rocks but possi-
bly also rich in balata for days i had
seen no maquiritares except my own two
men and though there are maquiritares on
the tamara they are very wild and live
far back so i expected to see none then

suddenly five indians were where only two
had been

  a surprized grunt from my own men
who were cleaning a couple of pavas i had
shot gave me my first warning of their
coming the three stood just at the backs
of the squatting pair and their faces were so
hard that for an instant i thought them
some of those wild tamara men angry at
finding us there but then i saw that one
of them was that young fellow who had
walked and talked with nama

  hola i called what do you here
is not all well on the uaychamo

  all is bad on all the ventuari one an-
swered shortly

  como i demanded

  bad blancos are here again

  diablo i swore who why

  we do not know who but they are
here because ramon rodriguez died on
the cunucunuma

  how do you know that i wondered
tell me what you know

  they looked hungrily at the two birds in
the hands of my men but those pavas
were not yet ready for cooking nor was a
fire built so they talked

  we had worked making our paragua
the speaker told me one day we saw
smoke in the sky it rose from quencua
with us was pepe who had come to
uaychamo with us from your sitio he
knew you had gone up the ventuari there
should be no smoke at quencua

  pepe went to see he did not come
back then we saw smoke at oso we
went to see we saw men with guns they
burned your casa

  i bounced out of my hamomck

  burned my house at oso

  it is so they looked very bad the
one who seemed to be capitdn had great
black whiskers he seemed to have no
nose he had very long arms but short
legs

  we kept out of sight we went back
we told our people to lie quiet our capi-
tdn told us to go to quencua we went
over the sabana at quencua were no men
but there were zamuros-vultures

  we swam across we found your sitio
burned we found pepe dead we found
the other maquiritares dead the zamuros
had scattered them but we saw fire marks
on trees we saw dry blood the maquiri-
tares had been tied to the trees and burned


adventure

what else was done to them we do not
know but they died slowly

  we found a stick standing in the ground
on the stick was a stuffed monkey it was
the areguato we left on the cunucunuma
on the monkey was tabari this is the
iabart

  from one ear-lobe he took a little roll of
the tabarl bark used in our up-orinoco
country for making cigarets as i took it i
felt sick the man he had described-long
arms short legs and almost no nose-was
el carnicero and as i unrolled the bark i
felt more sick

  on it was scrawled in the blood of my
good maquiritares-

   con los obsequios de ramn rodriguez y de paco
peldom

x

      for a few minutes after reading
that message from the butcher i
raved so that even my own men
hastily got away from me i could see
those indians of mine at quencua writhing
in flames mutilated by the torturing knives
of the paco gang and i was loco in truth

  the burning of my houses was nothing
they were palm structures which could
easily be rebuilt even if all my concealed
supplies had been found and looted the
loss was only that of goods but that
wicked work on my faithful muchachos
made me burn to destroy the butcher-
and not to do it quickly as the men of
yaracuma had destroyed rodriguez but
poco d poco-bit by bit

  when i could again talk with sense i
told my men to make ready to travel at
once while they took down my hammock
and made the other preparations i asked
the newcomers-

the people of the uaychamo are safe

  we do not know we left them days
ago

  porqui why

  to find you and tell you then to tell
el blanco negro 

  black white why tell him you are
not his people

  they made no answer they calmly
picked up the abandoned pavas and began
preparing to cook and eat them

and this is not the affair of black

   	with the respects of ramn rodriguez and paco pel-

dc-m

white i added it is the fight of loco
leon and loco leon pays his own debts
you will say nothing to black white you
will return with me to your capitdn

  they looked at me and at one another
their mouths hardening

  do you hear me i snapped

  we hear said one

  then go to my curial i will leave you
at the uaychamo when we pass vayal

  one muttered something to the others
carrying the birds they walked away
through the bush toward my canoe i
turned and growled at my men who still
weje not ready in a minute or two we fol-
lowed the men of yaracuma but when
we reached the boat they were not there

  aqufl i yelled here you fools

  they are gone capitdn one of my
muchachos told me they will not come
with us

  then let them go to the- vamosj

  we shoved off and began struggling down
through the rocks of the tamara

  we traveled fast so fast that we repeat-
edly bumped rocks in the raudales which is
not good treatment for even the stoutest
curial i was in a fever to reach my rav-
aged sitios and attack the whole paco gang
and though i knew that the distance from
tamara to oso could by hard paddling
with the current be covered in two days i
cursed because those two days were not
two minutes i feared that the butcher
would be gone when i arrived

  the men of yaracuma had spent days in
traveling to the tamara probably paco
was already gone i would get him though
if i had to follow him to san fernando and
shoot him in funes own headquarters

  but then as we surged away down the
ventuari itself with both my indians pad-
dling fast and myself steering i began to
use my head was the butcher likely to
be satisfied with burning my houses and
murdering a few maquiritares it was
hardly probable that would get him no
pay at san fernando more than that he
now wanted my head on his own account
to avenge my ridicule of him on the cunu-
cunuma

  and now that i thought of it i saw a
purpose in his work at quencua and oso
he probably had tried to torture from my
maquiritares some knowledge of where i
was the only thing they could tell him if
they would was that i had gone up the
the thirty gang



river for i myself never can be sure of what
i shall do when i start into those hills-i
make few plans and often change those
plans in a moment

  so then not knowing where to look for
me he might have fired those houses in the
hope that i should learn of it through in-
dians just as i had done and that i would
do just what i now was doing-rush in rage
to the place of his crimes

  the more i thought of it the more i be-
lieved this was so and if it was so he now
knew that his plan was succeeding for he
knew his message was gone from the stick
he had left at queiua so he and his cut-
throats would be waiting somewhere-
perhaps at oso perhaps at quencua per-
haps at both places-to get me when i
plunged into their trap

  as for the question of how he had come
to my place that was simple enough his
message and the monkey showed that he
had heard of the killing of rodriguez and of
my arrival on the cunucunuma and that
he had gone there

  i did not believe he had followed us over
the mountains it was more likely that he
had canoed back to the ventuari heard of
the death of bayona-which by then would
be common gossip among all river-men-
and supposed it was i not black white
who led those avenging maquiritares so
he had come up the ventuari and found
my sitios

  if he still waited for me though he might
reasonably expect me to come with the
same band of maquiritares who had killed
bayona indeed it seemed almost sure
that he would expect this for he himself
always had a gang he knew i was the friend
of maquiritares and if he were in my
place he would undoubtedly bring as many
indians as he could get so he probably
judged that i would do the same and he
would be alert

  with each of us seeking the blood of the
other the one who would live longest
would be he who could trick his enemy

  his strength was in his gang and his guns
mine was in the fact that i knew my ground
much better than he did thinking further
along the same fine i began to grin a few
minutes ago i had been telling myself that
perhaps i should be a fool to go alone
against paco now i felt that it was not so
foolish an idea if it was foolish then i
would be a fool to the limit

  i would not even take these last two
maquiritares of mine with me worse yet
i would go to fight those gun-men without
my rifle

  we traveled that day until darkness
halted us and at daybreak we were up and
away i had told my men i would go first
to visit yaracuma and asked them whether
they knew where he was to be found one
answered that he knew where pepe had
intended to lead the cunucunuma men
and that he could guide me over the sabana
to that spot

  so when we drew near the cano uay-
chamo i looked for a hiding-place for the
curial found a little brook barely wide
enough to hold it slid the canoe in out of
sight tied it covered it with bushes and
left it then we marched northwest head-
ing across the open land for the place where
the new paragua might be

  my men thought of course that i meant
to take the fighters of yaracuma with me to
quencua and i did not tell them of their
mistake until we had reached the tribe-
house it was not at the exact place where
pepe had thought it ought to be made but
we had little trouble in finding it for two
armed men met us in the bush and led us to
the right spot

  all was quiet there but everyone was on
the alert while half of the men worked
without noise at completing the house the
others scouted watched for enemies and
hunted meat

  as soon as i arrived yaracuma and every
one else who was near gathered around me
i wasted no time in telling why i came
they knew

  where are those diablos who killed my
men i asked

  they are at oso and quencua answered
yaracuma

 buenoi they wait for loco leon
they shall not wait long you have many
arrows

  si

  you have curare poison

  no

  como no poison

  no the poison we had is gone we
have not had time to trade for more

  i scowled i knew well enough of course
that the maquiritares do not make that
poison though they use it on their blow-
gun darts for killing much of their meat
they trade for it with the macos or the


adventure

piaroas but i knew they had had some
when they came from the cunucunuma
and it had not occurred to me that none
would be left now

  that is bad i grumbled i wanted
gourds of that swift death for my arrows
i cannot wait until men are sent to the
piaroas for more

  yaracuma looked puzzled so did all the
others

  yaracuma does not understand said
the capitdn loco leon does not use
arrows

  loco leon will use arrows now i con-
tradicted listen to what i shall tell you

  yaracuma and his people thought i
meant them to help me fight those evil men
is it not so yaracuma is wrong this is
not the fight of yaracuma it has nothing
to do with ramon rodriguez and the cunu-
cunuma it is true that if those men knew
yaracuma was here they would harm his
people but they do not know it or they
would have attacked before now those
men strike at loco leon alone loco leon
will strike back alone x

  but loco leon is one man and they are
more than one

  how many are they

  they are ten and seven

 seventeen that is more than i
thought but it does not matter it is all
the more reason why i should use arrows
if loco leon fighting alone should use his
gun it would make much noise and a bright
flash and blue smoke so they would know
where the gun was and would shoot their
own guns at it and soon loco leon would
be dead but the arrow flies with no noise
now does yaracuma understand

  he stared as if he could not believe me
men looked at one another one of my
own maquiritares muttered-

  es loco

  are you just learning it frasco i
laughed for what have i been called
loco all these years crazy i may be
but i do what i say i want no man with
me you and gil both shall stay here
they both scowled at that but i gave
them no more attention yaracuma was
asking-

  can loco leon shoot the bow

  give me one and see i said

  in my life among the maquiritares i had
amused myself more than once with their
weapons and though i could not handle

their long arrows as easily as if born to their
use i knew how to place them now a
man standing near handed me his stiff bow
and a long-headed tigre arrow i picked a
stump some distance away and drove the
arrow at it the missile struck at one side
gouged out bark and stopped in the ground
beyond

  that is not a good shot i said yet
if the stump were a man and the arrow-
head carried curare he would quickly die
i came here to ask yaracuma to give me a
good bow and many arrows and plenty of
curare i am sorry there is no poison i
want every arrow to kill

  yaracuma thought men talked among
themselves i noticed that some of them
looked at a thin rather old man with
bright narrow eyes yaracuma also looked
at that man

  loco leon would kill his enemies with
the poison he said as if thinking aloud

  i would kill those enemies with poison
i corrected him most men i would fight
with lead and steel but those fiends who
tortured my poor muchachos with knife and
fire who for years have done every beastly
crime known to men-the curare is too
good for them it does not hurt enough
if i knew of a worse thing i would use it i

would send those-into-with their

masters torment already at work

  faces grew grim and more than one man
nodded agreement the capitdn looked
again at the narrow-eyed man and that
man looked back at him then yaracuma
said

  if arrows are used those men will think
it done by indians they will hunt for

indians and-

  no i broke in when has loco leon
hidden behind his friends i shall mark
every arrow so that those men will know
it is loco leon who strikes them down i
want them to know it is loco leon the
man they hunt who kills them and sneers
at them that is one more reason why i
want arrows they can read those arrows
they could not read bullets

  he smiled a little and walked to the thin
man the two went slowly away together
talking low the others watched the pair
and a hum of indian words passed among
them something was coming and the
maquiritares had guessed what it was

  soon yaracuma came back the thin
man disappeared around the paragua
the thirty gang

i

  loco leon shall have his wish the
capitdn calmly told me bows and arrows
are here poison will be made

  curare

  no we do not make the curare but
there is another poison it is a very old
poison of our race it must be used only for
killing enemies on the day after tomorrow
it shall be ready

  it is as strong as the curare

  it is much worse it is so bad that it
has not been made among our people for
many years loco leon has said he wants
a poison fit for devils he shall have it

xi



in the long day that followed
little work was done at the paragua
of yaracuma every one talked
some of the things that were said i under-
stood but most of them i did not yet
i knew that the one thing every one talked
about was the mad plan of loco leon

  it was easy to see that some of the men-
especially the younger ones-were eager to
go with me the older men though who
had women and children to think of were
not so reckless if i had wanted them no
doubt i could have taken with me every
fighter in the tribe for though the maquiri-
tares murdered at quencua were not of the
cunucunuma they were maquiritares and
their torturers were hated by every one here

  my own two men frasco and gil were
very sullen and i could not blame them
they were comrades of the victims but it
now was a matter of personal pride with me
to avenge every one of- those deaths myself
also if i went alone i should have nobody
else to think about and so could direct my
movements more easily

  yaracuma himself not being a fool was
well satisfied to let me go my way and do
my best without aid since that was what i
desired if i killed all my enemies well
and good if not he and his men might
fight later on so he saw to it that the
making of the poison went forward-just
where and how it was done i do not know
for it was made in some secret spot by the
thin man-and he also ordered one of his
best bowmen to give me any help needed
with the arrows

  with this fellow to watch and correct
my manner of holding the weapon i prac-
tised for a time in the morning and im-

proved my shots the indians took almost
as keen an interest in this work as if i were
actually shooting at a man instead of a
stump they were much more serious about
it than i was and every good hit brought
a deep grunt from all around me

   when i tired of it my assistant and half
a dozen others went to inspecting the arrows
i was to carry testing the balance of each
examining them for straightness and
strength and throwing aside every one that
did not suit their opinions and i got out
the roll of tabarl bark which i always carry
up-river and with my pencil printed on
the thin sheets a message which would leave
no doubt in the mind of the butcher as to
who visited him

   while i was doing this squatting in the
shade and keeping my eyes on my work
some one came and stood before me at
first i did not look up for i was so much
accustomed to being watched by the in-
dians that i hardly noticed it but after a
time a voice said very softly-

  loco

   then lifting my eyes i saw nama

  she wanted to say something to me but
had not the words yet she gave me her
meaning she pointed to me then toward
quencua and shook her head then point-
ing eastward she said-

  negro

  and she waved the pointing hand down
along the river-line

   it was her way of telling me i must not
go alone to quencua and that black white
would come down the ventuari i smiled
and shook my head then by signs i
showed that i was determined to go as i
planned and that black white would not
come or if he did he would be too late
with that i resumed my pencil-work

  she tried to make me pay attention to
something more but i waved her aside
then some of the men spoke gruffly-
probably telling her she was meddling with
matters in which a woman should not
interfere slowly she went away

  black white would come i did not
believe it the raid of bayona in the hills
where white lived and the attack of paco
on the sitio of loco leon were far different
matters my affairs were nothing to him
especially when i asked no help and even
forbade the indians to tell him i thought
no more of it

  when my little messages were finished


adventure

i tied one around each shaft with bush-cord
that ended my days work i left to the
indians the packing of the arrows into
quivers and the selection of the bow as
well as the preparation of the poison only
one thing remained for me to do and that
i did when yaracuma was with me and
nobody else happened to be near

  yaracuma i said quietly i have told
frasco and gil that they must stay here
they do not like it they wish to go and
fight i ask my friend yaracuma to watch
them when i am gone and to stop them if
they try to follow me when i shoot the
arrows i shall not look to see the faces of
the men i shoot at i do not wish to strike
down my friends by mistake let no man
come after me

  it shall be as loco leon says he agreed
so with nothing more to be done i did
nothing but eat and sleep

  in the morning i found beside me a stout
bow a quiver with several arrows a corded
bundle of other five-foot shafts and a large
light round basket such as the maquiritares
use for packing on their backs yuca roots
and other food the basket seemed filled
with flat cakes of cassava

  all is ready yaracuma told me

  there is cassava enough for six men
i grumbled it is far too much and i
see no poison

  he smiled and lifted the top cakes then
i saw that they formed a lid and that under
them in a green nest of leaves were packed
two gourd bottles the necks of the bottles
were short wide and tightly closed by
wooden plugs

  the basket holds life and death he
said under the black juice is more cas-
sava there is a sling to carry a gourcl
there is a new bow-cord also all is here
it was the best packing i had ever seen
done by indians before i could reach my
foes i must eat and so the cassava was
placed ready at the top also it would
protect the poison from the hot sun during
my journey and the extra bow-cord
which i never should have thought of might
be useful in many ways

  it is better not to carry the poison in the
sling he told me but the sling is there
if wanted you should leave the poison at
some place after dipping the arrows you
must not let the poison touch your skin
you must handle the arrows carefully the
black juice is very hungry it eats

  it must be bad indeed i said i looked
around for the thin man but did not see
him where is the man who made the
juice

 why

  i should like to give him a knife

  he is sick he will be sick five days
no man can approach him

  it is because he made the poison

  it is so

  i said no more but i decided to be care-
ful with that poison

  when i had eaten a good breakfast i
swung up the basket settled its strap across
my forehead and had the quiver and the
extra arrows slung behind my shoulders
the basket was quite heavy for cassava is
solid food and the poison-gourds were none
too light the arrows though weighed
little as the long shafts were of hollow cane

  with my thin hammock on the basket
and my new bow and one arrow in my hands
i left the paragua and headed southwest
toward quencua

  oso was nearer but i did not go to oso
for two reasons one was that i did not
wish the brutes of paco to search for me too
close to uaychamo and thus perhaps dis-
cover the people of yaracuma the other
was that i wanted to repay my enemies on
the same ground where they had butchered
and burned my maquiritares moreover
the quencua woods were better for my
movements than those of oso and i was
quite sure that the oso men would go to
quencua as soon as they knew of what was
taking place there

  so leaving my rifle behind i walked out
into the sabana beyond the cano and began
my journey of vengeance to travel by the
river was impossible for that water was
watched paco and his men must be
cursing i knew because my canoe did not
appear they soon would curse for another
reason

  all that day i walked at night i slept
without a fire among some trees beside a
small stream at sunrise i traveled on
and about noon i heard the roar of quencua
toward the fall i turned and in another
hour or so i was among the trees through
which runs the only path around the fall

  in all the march i had seen no man either
ahead or behind now i became more
guarded for if any of the butchers were on
their way up or down the river they must
pass along that narrow track a mile long
the thirty gang



which connects the upper and lower ports
of the quencua raudal i did not yet smear
my arrow-heads with poison but i made
sure that those in the quiver were loose and
easy to draw and i carried one ready in
my hand

  soon i was in the path itself the damp
ground showed that men had passed within
a day going toward oso that was good
for it meant that at the lower end of the
path must be waiting one of my canoes in
which those men or others above meant to
journey down

  the problem of crossing the river had
bothered me a little for unless i could find
a canoe it vuld mean swimming and that
would spoil my only food-the cassava
now it would be easy

  i walked fast along the winding path
seeing no life but a few birds and a troop
of marimundo monkeys at the end i found
the canoe empty from among some rocks
i got an old paddle which i remembered
had been thrown there some time ago by
one of my men after half its blade split off
it now was partly eaten by ants and wood-
lice but it would do a few minutes later
i was swinging around the first bend head-
ing for my destroyed sitio

  now the river at this point winds a good
deal and between the white water of the
fall and the place where my house had stood
were seven turns i decided to journey
past four of these and then to hide the canoe
at a certain spot and finish my trip por
tierra-by land i kept close to shore cut-
ting across only to skirt the inside of each
turn and moving slowly as i rounded each
curve the first three bends showed me
nothing ahead except empty water but
the fourth-

  i bore back so hard that the rotten paddle
cracked a few rods farther down heading
up-stream was a canoe with three men

  helped by a shore eddy i got back un-
seen but there was no cover for the canoe
at that place indeed i was lucky even to
meet a spot where i could scramble up the
steep clay bank i managed it though and
when i reached the top i also had my bow
several arrows and one gourd of the poison
which i had grabbed as if it were harmless
as an empty calabash	v

  the canoe lay in plain sight held by a
snag

  in the bush at the top i wrenched the
cork from the gourd and swiftly dipped four

arrow-heads into the sticky black mess
within there was no time to be careful-
i jabbed them in one by one pulled them
out and arose ready to fight a yard or
two away was a small opening in the
greenery and at once i was there

  miral tjn curiali cried a surprized
voice look a canoe

  the other canoe had come around the
turn all its men stared i recognized
every one of them-villains named bias
salomon and gaspar more cruel than el
diablo himself looking at them i saw my
maquiritares twisting and gasping in agony
while the red knives of those men slowly
cut off their fingers and gouged out their
eyes and the red of that steel went into
my own brain i saw them in a fiery haze

  i do not just remember my movements
for a minute or two i do remember oaths
yells gunshots bullets smashing through
the bush around me then their canoe was
drifting back slowly in the current salo-
mn was huddled up motionless bias was
trying to pull an arrow from his stomach
gaspar had yanked another arrow from his
right shoulder and was looking at it with
eyeg full of terror

  veneno poison he yelled it is
black with poison o dios

  bias gave a choking moan and writhed
on his seat

  los indios los indiosl he gasped

  venenoi repeated gaspar his voice
more shrill it is fire-it is knives-it is
vitriol

  he threw the arrow down its point
struck the gunwale and stuck there stag-
gering clutching his shoulder yet he some-
how spied the tabari bark bound to the
shaft he dropped his hands and tore it off

  cien mil diablos he screeched it is
not indios it is loco leon mira listen
to the note on the arrow

   aqul estd su billcte para el infierno

loco ledn 

 loco leon howled bias ah -

- they did not get him oh cristol

what pain this is the very fire of-

in my bowels

  gaspar began to twist again his knees
gave way and he fell into the bottom of the
boat both of them squirmed and kicked
and swore they cursed me they cursed
paco they cursed themselves they began

  	here is your ticket to- loco len


adventure

to scream like madmen and then the
canoe faded out of sight around the turn

xii

hwhen the noise of the dying brutes
had become silence-as it soon did-
i went back to my poison-gourd and
stared down at it	i

  yaracuma spoke truth i said to my-
self this is a poison fit for fiends

  for a minute i felt like throwing the
infernal stuff into the river and continuing
my war with unvenomed arrows but then
i saw again my tortured maquiritares so
instead of casting the gourd away i plugged
it wrapped leaves around it and slid down
the bank as carefully as if i carried a bomb
back in the curial i laid the bundle down
like an egg and looked myself over to make
sure that none of the black poison had stuck
to my clothing then i pushed out

  when i rounded the turn for the second
time i saw no life the other canoe still
was in sight drifting down ahead but it
now held only three corpses stroking care-
fully to avoid a complete collapse of the
wrecked paddle i headed for the hiding-
place i had had in mind soon i was there
with the curial drawn into the narrow inlet
and bushes bent down as a curtain behind
it i considered my next step

  the drifting death-boat soon would reach
my old sitio and the men remaining there
undoubtedly would see it take it in and
learn that loco leon was near i had not
intended to let them know this until i was
in my own woods and ready to attack at my
own time but there was no help for it now
and the sooner i finished my journey the
better

  by making a long swing through the
sabana first to the south and then back to
the north i could reach my woods from the
rear with a good chance of avoiding any
guards and once there i might be able
to do a little more work of vengeance that
night

  so i dipped a half-dozen arrows in the
poison-pot shouldered the rest of my equip-
ment and struck into the hills to the south
when i had passed through the tree-belt
along the river and entered the open i had
no cover except the little cerros which meant
a good deal of turning in order to keep from
showing against the sky-line yet i made
good speed and not once did i meet men

and as sundown drew near i was at my own
little cano and stealing northward among
its trees just at dark i reached one of the
little huts in which i had hidden my trade-
goods before starting up the river

  everything there was as i had left it
whether the other two hiding-houses had
been found i did not know but this one
evidently had not soon all grew black
around me but i used no light later on
i knew there would be a moon

  while i rested and chewed cassava i kept
my ears open to every sound nothing
stirred though except the usual animal
life no voices came to me if any guards
were posted they probably were at the
river or at the big clearing where my house
had stood and where the gang now should
be camping no well-used paths were near
this little hut and it was hardly likely that
men would stand all night in what seemed
empty bush

  so when the moon came and made things
a little more visible i started toward the
river the bush was not too thick for quiet
travel if one moved slowly and i took care
to travel without noise with me i carried
the six arrows freshly smeared which had
been in my teft hand all the afternoon
they now hung in the quiver slanting across
my back

   at length i reached the edge of the clear-
ing the moon now was well up and the
open space was quite light i saw at once
that my casa was gone and so were two
other palm houses where my indians used to
sleep but one shelter still stood it was an
open-sided shed in which various belongings
of mine had been kept now it was the
sleeping-quarters of the gang there i
could see the vaglie curves of hammocks
and the red spots of glowing cigarets and
hear growling voices no guard was in
sight

  moving very carefully i worked along the
edge until i was as near the house as i could
come without showing myselfr it was near
enough to hear what was said

   paco is a fool and this proves it some-
body was grumbling  wait says paco
and he will come t be killed and we wait
in this hole and feed the mosquitoes with
our blood-caramba i am an itch from hair
to toes and does he come no and
while paco sits on his rump oso the
indios walk in between and kill us phew
what a stench was bias
the thirty gang



  si said another man and salomon
too and all three of them black as the rio
negro i would not have touched them or
one of those arrows for a hundred pesos
several other voices grunted agreement
and thus i learned that the dead men must
have been left to float on downward carry-
ing my arrows with them and so nobody
yet knew that i was near that was good
but paco himself the man i most wanted
was not there and that was not so good

  i say again what i said before rumbled
a third voice that this thing was not done
by maquiritares those indios use only
curare and no curare would bloat and burst
men as that poison did there must be
other indios here perhaps a few of those
guaharibo fiends who live east of the
padamo have come here on a raid they
must be few or they would have taken the
rifles from the curial

  a fourth broke out with curses upon all
indians

  snakes all he swore guaharibos or
maquiritares or whatever they may be
they are snakes see what they fid to
ramon rodriguez and those accursed
maquiritares we found here-would one of
them talk would they tellwhere to find

that dog of a len pah they-

  we were too gentle with them some-
body interrupted a chorus of cruel laughter
followed i grew hot and drew an arrow

  mira what is that some one asked
sharply do you not see something move
there

  i stood perfectly still there was a
silence

  there is something light but it does not
move moonlight on the leaves another
said then nothing can come from the
river without being seen miguel is on the
watch and no indios would dare come so
near us in the bush knowing we are awake
but another silence followed somebody
stirred a man came out leaning forward
and squinting and stopped

  it was not there a little while ago i
heard him muttering it is- diablo
my gun lazaro quick

  he spun on his heels i let fly the arrow
a shriek broke from him and he stum-
bled clutching at one leg like lightning
i drew and shot two more arrows at the
hammocks where cigarets had suddenly
dropped and rifle-clicks sounded then i
threw myself sidewise and down

  i had not touched the ground when bullets
were ripping over me while i plunged for-
ward on hands and knees gripping my bow
in one fist more bullets crashed through
the moving bushes one stung my chin
another nipped my right thigh but i got
away nobody had the courage to rush
at the bush and close with me and the
bullets did not quite find me perhaps the
yells of the men i had hit-there were two
at least-helped me to escape

  el veneno the poison they screamed
it is the black poison o santo dios

  alarmed curses sounded from other men
as the guns became still the screams be-
came louder and higher i did not linger
there but those sounds followed me far
into the tangle as i went

  so i said you who laughed a minute
ago over your gentleness to my faithful
men now scream over a quicker death than
they had you yell now to god do you
it is far too late for him to listen to you

 and i worked onward under the moon
toward my hut feeling no pity for the
 howling cowards behind

  yet when i lay in my hammock and
thought about it before falling asleep-
which was not long for i was very tired-
i was not so well satisfied with my indian
way of fighting as i had thought i should be
to imagine those brutes dying in torment
had been a joy but to see and hear it was
not quite so pleasant and though i told
myself that this kind of death was no worse
than they deserved i felt more and more
that i was not fighting as a white man
should fight the impulse to destroy that
deadly mess in the gourds became stronger
than it had been on the river

  in another way too i was not well
pleased with the use of the bow and arrow
the bow was a clumsy thing to handle in
the bush and so was the long arrow i
could not crouch or lie flat and thus cover
myself as when using a rifle and when i
had been crawling for my life just now the
bow had caught in vines and the arrows
in leaves hindering my movements

  an indian would have handled them
much more easily of course but i was no
indian and i was learning that shooting
at a stump outside a maquiritare paragua
and fighting live enemies in the woods were
not the same i wished i had brought my
rifle and i was glad that i still wore my
revolver and poniard




adventure

  then i went to sleep and forgot it all

  the next morning though while i ate
i looked at the gourds and gave up all
thought of abandoning them now that
i had begun this kind of war i must con-
tinue it for since my revolver was short
of barrel and good only for close work the
arrow was the only weapon with which i
could strike from any distance and unless
my figuring was wrong i ought to be able
to wipe out the rest of this quencua gang
today or tonight

  there were seventeen in all the indians
had said the butcher expecting me to
come past oso would hardly leave more
than half his force at quencua-eight men
yesterday i had killed at least half of those
eight in fact i was almost sure of five
deaths not more than three men then
remained here i would get them in the
next few hours

  so with fresh arrows i slipped out again
into the trees moving even more stealthily
and slowly than last night i went again
to the clearing reaching it i found no-
body there

  i had not expected of course to see my
enemies in plain sight warned by my
messages they would be hidden in the bush
watching and waiting for me to return
but as i too waited trying to spy some
slight movement or catch some sound to
indicate where those men might be i felt
more and more that the place was empty
of human life birds came some monkeys
passed about but the man-feeling-if you
senores understand what i mean by that-
was not in the air

  yet i did not trust my senses i would
not believe the men were gone until i proved
it moving with extreme care keeping
always covered i circled the clearing then
i became sure those last men had fled

 when i came out into the open and
walked toward the sleeping-house i saw why
they had gone there on the ground were
three horrible things which had been men
those arrows which i had shot last night
had done their work well whether all
three had made hits or whether one had
missed and another had wounded two men
i could not know but three corpses now
lay under the hammocks they were so
frightful that i could not go near them
i hastily got back into the bush and left
the place

  the last two men had not even dared to

drag those bodies to the river and get them
away from there they themselves had
gone instead under the moon where
to oso no doubt to tell their chief

  for a while i thought of following them
to oso walking the sabana then i decided
to wait for the butcher to come to me he
probably would come with all speed

  so i traveled the bush to another of my
hidden shelters where i could find coffee and
make a fire and have a better meal than for
some time finding it undisturbed i quick-
ly cooked the coffee and drank until i could
hold no more then i stretched myself
and lay down on the supplies for a siesta

  the luck of loco leon still holds good
i told myself soon my account with el
carnicero will be closed and then we shall
have peace on the ventuari

  yet before sunset i was to feel that all
luck had deserted me

xiii

i was in ambush on the river-bank
when my luck failed

  it was late in the day and paco
and the rest of his gang might possibly be
nearing the place i did not really expect
them so soon for the rivfer between quencua
and oso is so bad  that it would take hard
fast work for those up-bound men to reach
him and bring him back in so short a time
still it was possible so having nothing
else to do i was watching the river from a
little bushy pointt the entrance of my
cano up which was the landing-place for
canoes

  before me stood a big mora tree which
would give me cover from bullets around
me stood a few bushes and oritwo of these
in crotches hip-high from the ground lay
a- dozen ready arrows by trimming
branches with my knife i had inade those
bushes into a rack for the shafts easier to
reach than any back-quiver

  the deadly heads all pointed forward
and when the time should come i could
snatch the cane shafts rapidly enough to
drive them in a stream at the carioe-men
meanwhile i leaned against the tree giving
all my attention to the river the three
dead men in the clearing behind me were
not likely to do me any harm and i knew
of no other men

  across the river a couple of areguatos
were howling at each other making the
the thirty gang



horrible noise those monkeys always make
if it had not been for their roaring i might
have tinned in time to make a better fight
as it was i heard nothing near me until
several quiet clicks struck my ears then
i whirled-too late

  five rifles covered me behind them
stood men of san fernando and farther
back along the path i saw more men hold-
ing guns ready to throw to an aim

  for a few seconds i stood dumb and the
more i stared the more amazed i grew
these men did not belong to the gang of the
butcher

  carambai i said when my breath came
back what is this what are you doing
here

  we are catching a len asleep one of
them mocked come forward-with your
hands up

  i stood still looking at faces like paco
these men were of the army of funes and
they were no better than the brutes of the
butcher i suspected-and soon found it
true-that they were another pack sent out
from san fernando to get me but i wanted
to know why

  does the coronel order this i de-
manded

  come here was the snarling answer
lift those hands

  i knew then that this was not the work of
funes if it had been they would have
said so for an army party usually made a
formal arrest in the name of the coronel
-though it often executed its prisoner
immediately afterward not that i should
have meekly surrendered if they had used
funes name i asked only because i was
amazed and puzzled

  i took a slow step forward as if obeying
and i raised my hands but i did not raise
them far or keep them empty letting my
bow drop i snatched my revolver fired
and fell all in the same movement

  the rifles roared almost in my face but
the bullets smashed my hat instead of my
head i kept shooting as fast as i could
shift my aim from man to man-and that
was very fast indeed at that short range i
could not miss every man of those five
staggered two of them fell

  my gun empty i sprang up and jumped
toward the river intending to dive off swim
down-stream under water and try to get
into the bush but i had hardly turned and
begun to move outward when a terrible

blow struck my right leg with the blow
came another gun-shot i tumbled sprawl-
ing on my face

  before i could drag myself forward men
were on me i fought squirmed over drew
my poniard struck at somebody my arm
was caught and twisted a rifle-barrel
crashed on my head everything went black

  when i could see again a ring of men
stood around me one was squatting beside
me and tying up my hurt leg with a strip
cut from my trousers my revolver and
poniard were gone

  much surprised to find myself still alive
and still more astonished to see that some
care was being given my wound i lay still
and stared around i was in the same place
where i had fallen and felt that i had not
been long unconscious

  scanning faces i now saw that one was
that of jaime pecoro a corporal under
funes and a gang leader on his own account
he was as merciless as paco the butcher
except that he was not so cruel a killer but
not a torturer

  well jaime i said it seems that you
are the winner but since when have you
let your men do your work while you
skulked behind you were not here when i
fought

  i was at the clearing beyond he
growled we were looking in all directions
for you and these men found you you

- you have killed two of them

  only two i mocked my cartridges
must be bad what of the other three
jaime smiled sourly several others
chuckled in a grim way

  they are hit but they are tough he
said the fools should have shot first and
talked afterward but you are not so clever
as men say if you let them walk so near
to you

  i was watching for a dear friend of mine
-el carnicero i retorted he may come
at any moment you had best be careful

  the - roast him jaime snorted

he is nothing that paco you are slow
or you would have killed him-before now
el carnicero bah elrelmznador 

  i fear that you do not like the gentle-
man i said it isra pity but why do
you come here and interrupt my plan to
receive him

  he grinned again but his eyes were cold
as those of a snake

   	rebuznador-a braying jackass


adventure

   why because he is not good enough
 for his work he has been given time
 enough to do a dozen such jobs

   i see and now you have been given
 the work instead yes i thought so then
 why do you not finish it now

    there is no hurry he said with a care-
  less wave of the hand you will not run
  with that leg and you will not shoot again
  with no gun i will attend to you when i
  am ready until then we shall talk and be
  comfortable

    i studied him and then laughed though
 i did not feel at all merry he meant just
 what he said when he was ready he would
 chop off my head with no more feeling than
 if he were cutting a bush but while i lived
 i intended to seem as cool as he was

    that is quite agreeable i said i
  wish you had kept away until i had seen
 paco-i have a personal account to settle
 with him but that can not be helped now
 i am sorry also that i can not receive you in
 my casa but you must blame paco for that
 he burned it while i was away

    he nodded shortly

    where are your indios he demanded
    i have no indios i denied

   that is a lie every one knows you
 have the maquiritares in your hand you
 and they killed coronel bayona we met
 on the river a canoe with three bodies-
 phew-and arrows we find more bodies
 and more arrows here where are those
 indios

    i	held my tongue a minute he did not
 know those arrows had been shot by loco
 leon it would do me no good to tell him
 so or to let him know of those other arrows
 so near us i might yet find some chance
 to save myself

   they are not here- i was about to
 say when every man jumped from the
 entrance of the cano just beyond the mora
 tree sounded the bump of a paddle against
 the side of a canoe

   holal jaime called sharply who
 comes

   paco peldom growled an answering
 voice who are you

   jaime grinned once more his teeth
 looked like the bared fangs of a tigre

 paco peldom he sneered you are
 too slow and too late paco your game is
 trapped by jaime pecoro travel onward
 a savage curse sounded from the water
 the ring of men around me swung back and

became a line facing the cano and holding
their guns half-raised i turned over on an
elbow and looked but saw only the bush
between me and the edge of the bank

  what game do you mean yelled the
butcher how come you here you-

  the game you were not good enough to 
catch pecoro taunted him you have
been away for weeks and done nothing
now jaime pecoro comes here and catches
your icon in less than an hour after going
ashore go on down the river to san
fernando peldom and ask the coronel for
a place as grave-digger you are growing
too old for this work

  the men standing behind me laughed
jeeringly the butcher roared a string of
foul names which only made jaime grin
wider than ever

  you he paco raved you catch
leon you you could not catch a sick

monkey  and i am old am i you-

son of a- get off this river before i

show you how old i am you will come
here to steal my meat will you you
crawling snake-

  i	looked at jaime his eyes were glitter-
ing but he still grinned that cold grin he
was enjoying pacos rage too much to
shoot i sat up

  give me a gun jaime-a revolver-any-
thing i asked let me settle my score
with that filthy brute after that-

  ii	si after that you will shoot me also
leon he jeered you are not to be
trusted with a gun lie down again before
i kick you down

  but i did not he down i started to crawl
toward my arrows which nobody had no-
ticed i was determined to kill the butcher
before i should die in my turn

  somebody fell on me and forced me fiat
on the ground then came another roar
from the cano

  diabloi it is the truth you have
leon there then por dios you shall give
him to me he is mine and i will have him

  water splashed and paddles bumped
jaimes rifle clicked but he was not yet
through with talking

   si he is here but he belongs to a better
man than you he called go back to
san fernando with your tail between your
legs if you know what is best for you-or
you will never return there at all

  a snarl was the only answer a scram-
bling sound on the bank-then the ugly
the thirty gang



face of paco arose beside the mora tree
gripping his rifle glowering like a mad dog
he came lunging savagely toward me the
man holding me jumped up more gun-
clicks sounded behind me in one more
second there would have been shooting

  but in that one second something else
happened paco gave a sudden grunt
grabbed at his stomach halted as if struck
looked down for the space of three
breaths he stood like a block of wood
then he jumped back as if from a
snake

  his rifle dropped his face lifted and it
was gray-white his mouth worked his
tongue made a horrid sound without words
and down the front of his dirty shirt and
breeches showed a row of black spots sur-
rounded by red

  he had run straight upon the points of
my waiting arrows

xiv

sa jaime and his men must have
lesml thought i had suddenly gone mad

i let out a wild screech of laughter

  welcome paco i yelled welcome
to the place where you burned helpless
maquiritares welcome to the pleasures

of- i received your message written in

the blood of those poor tortured ones and
my answer is marked on your belly in red
and black i trust that you will enjoy our
meeting as much a i

  his face twisted and he stooped toward
his gun- but he did not pick it up his
hands went to his stomach and he stood
humped over

  ah-h-h he groaned ah cristol
el veneno

  a grunt ran among the men of jaime i
struggled up to my feet and nobody
touched me standing on my one good leg
i laughed again however i might have
felt about the use of that poison before i
now could keenly enjoy the misery of this
inhuman beast

  it was most amusing was it not to
watch my mucliachos twist and writhe under
the torment i went on but the rest of
us were not here to see it paco will you
not show us how they danced and sang for
you if you cannot think of anything to
sing there is a little sentence on each of
those shafts which is most appropriate
take one of them off carnicero mio and

read it and then sing to us while you can
that will not be long unfortunately

  he staggered tried to straighten up but
did not touch the arrows his men no
doubt had told him what that message on
the tabari bark was he groaned again
and looked at me with eyes full of hate

  ah oh demonio he gasped leon

-you diablo del injierno-you are- ah

dios

  he doubled over again

  what is this leon demanded jaime
is it a snake there in the bush that has
struck him what is this talk

  i gave him no answer in another minute
he was more puzzled than before

  behind the butcher arose other heads-
those of his men climbing the bank they
stopped watched their master with faces
growing harder and pointed to the arrows
which they now could see an ugly growl
sounded in their throats then as paco
began reeling about and groaning more
loudly they surrounded him

  there was a struggle paco fell and
thrashed about the men dodging him as
if he were a serpent hurried toward us
lifting their hands high as they came
one held the butchers gun as well as his
own another carried pacos belt with
revolver poniard and machete they had
taken all his weapons and were leaving him
to die like a poisoned dog

  peace one said shortly we join
you pecoro he dies and he wall be mad
before he goes it was so with the others
so we take his arms you had best throw
him into the river before he bursts and
becomes foul

what is it jaime demanded again
poison of the indios the butchers
man replied a most horrible poison
found by this fiend of a leon you had
best kill him too and quickly

  diablo so that is it

  jaime gave me a hard look but before
he could think more about it paco became
violent

  yelling and foaming he fought up upon
his logs before any of us guessed what he
would do he had grabbed several of the
long arrows into a bundle and swung the
points toward us he drew back his
arm-

  i dropped flat and just in time with a
screcch paco heaved his fistful of death at
us throwing the shafts all at once as if they


adventure

were a spear then he fell laughing hor-
ribly the arrows separated in the air a
frightful yell of fear broke out behind me

  turning i found three men wounded by
the black points two more arrows had
dropped and stuck in the dirt an instant
later gunshots roared

  the three doomed men were shot in
their tracks by their companions it was a
merciful death for them more bullets tore
into paco rolling and kicking in the bushes
some one shot at me too and why he
missed i do not know unless his gun was
knocked down in the confusion as it was
the bullet spattered dirt into my face and
eyes for a few seconds i could not see

  when i had wiped the dirt away i saw
men dragging the three bodies to the river
paco was being lifted by four men who
held his hands and feet and yanked him to
the bank he was still twitching and mak-
ing a low moaning noise the four gave
him a swing forward back forward-and
let go he went sprawling out into the air
like a great toad

  a heavy splash sounded followed by
three more as the other arrow-struck men
were dropped and then the cannibal
caribe fish had a meal which no doubt
killed them also

  i heard a grim chuckle overhead and
looked up at jaime he was unhurt and
cool as ever i did not laugh with him for
my leg was hurting badly now and i felt
sick but i did grin a little when he told
the joke

  adios paco he said you had to
blunder even in dying you bumped into
your own death without seeing it and
when you tried to kill me you only de-
stroyed three of your own men not a man
of mine was touched by an arrow ha ha
then he moved like a flash his rifle
covered somebody behind me

  altol he snapped what do you do
with that

  turning my head i saw one of pacos
brutes holding an arrow its point was
directed at my back

  i will give this accursed leon his own
dose the man snarled i want to see
him squirm as my cousin did last night
no you will not jaime told him
throw that thing into the river i take
this mans head to san fernando i will
have no poison in it throw that arrow
muttering something the man stepped

to the bank and cast the deadly shaft
outward

  and remember that jaime pecoro com-
mands here you dog jaime went on
what i want done will be done and
nothing else if you make one more move
without my orders it will be your last do
you understand me

  he understood so did the others left
from the butchers gang not one of them
even spoke in my hearing after that

  jaime lowered his rifle and looked again
at me

  so you are the band of indios he said
are there more of those arrows

  that is for you to learn i retorted
since you promise me only death i need
not tell you anything

  as you like he said with a shrug
i will not promise you life since i came
here to take your head men look there in
the bush for more arrows if any are there
burn them

  moving very carefully men searched and
found all the arrows left soon they and
my bow as well were feeding a little fire

  now go and bring up the canoes he
ordered move fast for it will soon be
dark heberto and carlos remain here to
help me watch this mad ledn i am afraid
of him 

  he grinned again but his joke was half-
truth for he stepped out of my reach and
kept his eyes on me while the rest were gone
and the two who stayed with him also
watched me steadily jaime squatted
made a cigarro and smoked it never losing
sight of me for an instant

  since you will not talk he said it
was a waste of time to bind up your leg i
did not want you to bleed to death too soon
why not talk awhile you will live no
longer by being sulky

  when do you expect to kill me i
asked feeling a natural curiosity on that
subject

  before i sleep you are too dangerous
to be kept alive over night we shall smoke
your head a little so that it will not spoil
before we reach san fernando i will save
you until after i eat because a beheaded
man bleeds much and it might spoil my
appetite after that-whenever i feel
sleepy i will put you to sleep also

  you are as cold as a fish i said but
do not forget that you are likely to get into
serious trouble with the coronel for killing
the thirty gang



me without his order i am worth some-
thing to him with my balata tax

  that does not worry me you are worth
a very good price-it has doubled since you
killed bayona and his men-and as soon
as i collect my money i shall quit funes
he is a madman and not to be trusted and i
work always for the good of jaime pecoro
i see you are a man of business

  he nodded

  since that is so i went on possibly
i can overbid your employers my head
is worth more to me than to any one else i

have money-

 where here

  not much here but plenty in bi-

  ha he sneered i do no business on
credit let you go to bolivar for your
money i am not such a fool at san
fernando i shall get solid silver money for
you but i talk too much what was that
you said to paco about torturing maquiri-
tares and what was it about burning
your house i am curious

  i will tell you that i said if you will
first tell me how you got behind me and
caught me

  it was very simple he explained i
brought from san fernando one of your
men who knows this place instead of
coming by boat to your cano we tied up at
one farther down and walked overland
then we came through the woods and
looked around the clearing and i sent men
in different directions to hunt for signs
and here you stood against that tree
sound asleep it was too easy

  he laughed again and i cursed those
howling monkeys which had spoiled my
hearing cursed that san fernando mestizo
who had led this gang here too though it
was no more than could be expected-such
a man would do anything for a few pesos
but i kept my curses inside my own head
i would not give him the fun of hearing me
swear as paco had done

  then i told him of the butchers treat-
ment of my muchachos and his destruction
of my place as i had promised to do but
i said nothing of the people of yaracuma
or of how i had obtained my poison nor
did i deny that i had killed bayona there
was no use in either i held the talk to
paco and what i knew of him and while i
talked i was trying to see some way of
escape-and finding none

  the canoes came and after they reached
the landing-place up the cano the men re-
joined jaime at the point the sun now
was down and it would quickly be dark
jaime arose and ordered me carried to the
landing-place

  hold his arms tight and when you let
him go give him no chance to snatch a
weapon from you he commanded leon
you had best try no tricks or you will eat
no cena tonight

  i was seized firmly held and borne along
the path to the landing there dry wood
was quickly gathered and several good fires
made by the time darkness had come the
whole place was well lit up and more wood
was piled at hand i felt a little chilly when
i noticed that some green stuff also was
brought and laid near one fire it was
meant for smoking my head

  there was no chance for me men were
all about and i was kept in the brightest
light i looked longingly at the steep
bushy bank just across the cano now a
black mass if only i could reach it-
but i could not

  so i made the best of it determined that
when the time came i would take it with
my eyes open-and that i would make
whatever poor fight i could hands and
teeth could not do much damage but i
would leave a few marks behind me and
in the meantime i would eat and drink and
keep my nerves steady a man is never
dead until he is a corpse

  jaime and i ate facing each other with
men and fires in a ring around he had
some tapir-meat plantains and coffee be-
sides the usual farina and after eating
cassava alone for days i found those things
good especially the meat and the fried
plantains both of us ate heavily as if
nothing further were to take place and
when the meal was done we both smoked
cigarros

  you are a better executioner than el
camicero jaime i said with a laugh
that i tried to make real instead of
eating and smoking with me he would have
begun at my toes in cutting off my head
si he nodded that was his way
and where is he now such work is not
business to me it is not pleasure either
a clean sure job with quick pay-that is
the way of jaime pecoro

  there are worse ways i agreed

  and we smoked on


adventure

  it bccame very still the men around
us smoked and watched none of them
spoke jaime asked no more questions
my own tongue became dry something
cold began to creep around my heart time
seemed to drag and yet to go all too fast

  i wanted to talk but i could think of
nothing to say never before had i been in
such a position death is nothing i told
myself but that slow silence that unfeel-
ing business man deliberately taking his
time that green pile ready to smoke my
head in a few minutes more-those things
gnawed at me

  jaimes cigarro was smoked down to a
butt before he moved the quietness had
become a cold horror there seemed to be
no animal noises in the night and even the
breathing of the men seemed to have
stopped then jaime dropped his burned-
out roll of tobacco his face stretched in
a long yawn calmly he arose

  i am sleepy he said

  and he drew his machete

  if you will bend over leon and rest on
your hands it will be easier he suggested
a clean cut i do not like ragged work

  i looked about me no chance no hope
was within reach jaime was raising the
machete

  give me time to set my knees i said

  i began to move my bad leg around i
drooped forward a little but not enough
for his swing if i could brace my knees
under me i meant to spring at him to try
to seize machete-revolver-anything-and
fight till death while i moved i kept my
shoulders hunched shortening my neck
giving no chance for the clean cut he
wanted i did not look up at him i feared
he would read my eye

 and then-

  a harsh voice yelled it was in the bush
across the cano instantly flame spat from
that bush

  gunshots cracked my ears jaime stag-
gered other men leaped and screamed i
jumped forward jaime fell over me he
stayed down

  the streaks of flame shot out again-
again-again the keen reports made a
ragged rip that did not stop the men of
jaime pecoro jumped and yelled and fired
and fell the cano seemed bursting with
noise

  i threw myself at jaime who lay still a
hole in his head i wrenched out his re-

volver and emptied it at his men and
then there were no men there was nothing
but the blazing fires-sprawling bodies-
another harsh yell-and sudden silence

  quien es i shouted staring at that
black bush

  a wild laugh screamed back at me that
same harsh voice tore across the water

  ha ha ha it yelled dead men
walking in the night dead men walking
in the night poor murdered indians with
bows and arrows ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

xv

i looked around seeking any
living man of jaime or of paco who
might still be dangerous i saw
none there were two or three who moved
a little but it was plain that they would
not move long then i suddenly felt very
old and tired and i sank down beside dead
jaime caring little for what might happen
next

  the bushes across the cano rustled loudly
bold splashes and sounds of swimming
followed beside the canoes arose wet
indians they came up the sloping shore
carrying tigre spears and walked swiftly
around among the bodies into every
mans heart they slipped their spearheads
making sure that none should escape by
pretending death then they gathered
before me

  como std uste loco asked one

  he was frasco one of my own maquiri-
tares and another of them i now saw
was gil

  i am not very well i grumbled how
come you here i told you to stay with
yaracuma

  el blanco negro told us to come an-
swered gil yaracuma too is here we
shall bring the fighters

  with no more words they turned back to
the cano across it they shoved the canoes
there was much bush-rustling crossing
and recrossing of boats landing of men
then the place was full of maquiritares-
and of maquiritares alone black white
their leader did not cross he remained in
the masking bush seeing all and himself
unseen

  among those indians were at least a
score with guns long repeating rifles with
box magazines which looked very powerful
across the chests of those men hung stout
the thirty gang



shoulder-belts of woven fibre studded with
cartridges held in loops

  each man wore two of those bandoleros
and each had also a hip-belt from which
hung one of those straight narrow-bladed
machetes called casanareno-a knife like a
sword made for stabbing as well as for
slashing the men themselves looked more
hard and stern than maquiritares usually
do and every one of them had the build of a
fierce fighter

  these men walked about among the
bodies as the ones with spears had done
but not for the same purpose they took
from every dead man his weapons which
they laid on the ground rifles revolvers
machetes knives cartridges each kind in
its own little pile each pile close to the others

  then they drew together and stood there
leaning on their own guns one of them
gave brief orders to the uaychamo indians
these picked up the bodies and with torches
taken from the fires walked out along the
path to the river soon they came back
empty-handed

  in less than fifteen minutes from the
time when jaime stood up and drew his
machete he and all his gang had disap-
peared forever from the eyes of men so
had the treacherous mestizo who had led
them there so had the last of the butchers
killers they never would reach the ori-
noco-the caribes would see to that and
only we men of the ventuari knew what had
become of them

  i looked up at yaracuma who stood
quietly near me armed with a stout bow
and a full quiver of arrows i glanced
around at his men carrying the weapons of
their  race who now were soberly watching
me i let my eyes drift again over the gun-
fighting force which i never had seen before
but which i was to know thereafter as the
thirty gang of el bianco negro i looked
long at the silent bush beyond the water
where black white himself was watching
me and in my heart i thanked god for
such friends as these

  then i gave thanks also to the man across
the cano

  gracias blanco i called perhaps
some day i can repay this you came at a
good time but why

  what answered the rough voice
no thanks to me go thank your woman
has she fed you the yucut sehi yet ha-
ha-ha

  my woman you mean nama

  who else he jeered have you other
women too thats bad business loco i
played that game before i died i fooled
with em all-and they got me in the end

black black black as the soot of-

yah god

  but what do you mean i persisted
what had nama to do with this

  she sent her brother to me you fool
you saw him at the tamara she and my
woman juana got thick as thieves that day
on the iurebe juana told me how things
were between you when i was alive id
do anything to accommodate the ladies-
except marry em-ya-ha-ha now that
im dead i still listen to em so when my
woman and yours both wanted you helped
and there was more killing in sight to make

it interesting-

  well here we are im tired of talking
shut up

  i did shut up i sat there marveling so
that young fellow with whom nama had
walked was her brother and i owed my
life to two women and the wild man over
there had done this because of them it all
seemed impossible but i was feeling more
and more tired and sick i stopped think-
ing and lay back on the ground and let
myself slip off into nowhere

  i stayed in that land of nowhere for
some time i do not remember anything
more that night or in several days and
nights after that then i was lying in a
hammock and over me was a new leaf-roof
and in other hammocks near me lay yara-
cuma and the thin indian who had made
the terrible black poison

  it was late in the day and cloudy and
cool the chief and his medicine man were
dozing and i looked around to see where i
was the house was one of those quickly-
made maquiritare shelters of pole and
platani and two others stood near the
trees beyond were those of my own clearing

  the thin man opened one eye and looked
at me then he opened both and arose
he studied me very sharply and grunted
something to yaracuma who had joined
him both looked well satisfied

  you are better said yaracuma it is
good

  fever i asked

  it is so the fever was bad the leg
was bad but you soon will walk

  tell me what has been done i requested


adventure

  we have cleaned this place we piled
wood and burned that house of death and
what was in it we made these new houses
this man has made drinks for you he has
killed your fever he is making your leg
whole

  el blanco negro is gone he went
when the next sun came my men stayed
one day some are here now i sent the
others home there is much work for them
the women and children must be pro-
tected

  i nodded and let my mind go back to
the last night i remembered then i asked-
the brother of nama went to black
white

  it is so

 why

  to tell of the bad blancos

  i know that but did nama ask that
it be done

  she asked it and i ordered it

  oh it was by the command of yara-
cuma

i ordered it he repeated i did it
because you ought to know what was done
here el blanco negro too should know
then it was your work and not hers
she asked it but it was done because
it was sense

  i see but i did not quite see either
i wondered that she had dared to tell the
chief what he ought to do then a possible
reason came to me

  is she of your blood i asked

  she is the child of my sister

  i see i said again that was a differ-
ent matter

  there was a little silence yaracuma
watched me and after a time his eyes
smiled

  nama soon will mate he told me

  is it so perhaps i looked relieved
for the capitdn now smiled with mouth as
well as eyes

  it is so he replied for a time she
dreamed she might mate with loco leon
the young sometimes dream foolishly
but the dream has passed

  i said nothing soon he went on

  before loco leon came to us nama
looked kindly on one of my young men
then came ramon rodriguez like a spirit
of evil and loco leon like a spirit of good
in her dark hour her heart turned to loco
leon the young man of her tribe was
forgotten

  in those days she had good counsel and
bad her brother spoke to her the truth
that it is bad for maquiritare and bianco
to mate that it is worse for maquiritare
woman to think of a bianco who does not
think of her that loco leon wants no
woman and she must think no more of him
but on the iurebe the woman juana of
uaunana spoke other words she told
nama that loco leon could be made black
like el blanco negro that then he would
not go out among other men for shame
that no other woman would want him so
he should be hers alone

  nama thought upon these things but
in the end she saw that loco leon did not
want her she saw that even if made black
he would not want her he would hate her
with a bitter hate she does not want loco
leon ever to hate her so the good counsel
of her brother became strong in her mind
her eyes were opened again and she saw
once more the young man she had forgotten
and she found him good so there will be
no more dreaming and all is as it should be

  si i agreed she has judged wisely
and rightly i shall be ever a friend to
nama and to all the people of yaracuma
but my heart does not turn to her and
where the heart does not turn the body
should not be given-or taken

  it is so yaracuma said solemnly and
we said no more

  in a little while i slept again

  before many days i was again on my
legs and then yaracuma and his medicine-
man and the others of his tribe returned to
their cano uaychamo leaving me with
frasco and gil and one of the first things
i did was to visit that hut where my two
gourds of poison lay and to have a deep
hole dug and the gourds dropped into the
bottom then frasco and gil filled the
hole with stones crushing the gourds to
nothing

  i was through with fighting like a savage
if my own pride in being a white man
had not been strong enough to make me
abandon such weapons the fact that black
whites men used guns would have shamed
me for when indians fight like white
men a white who uses poisoned arrows is
far lower than indians-he is no better
than a snake

  now that i had seen those gun-men of
black white i tried to learn by question-
ing my own maquiritares and others how
trade jargon



they armed themselves but as always
when asked about el blanco negro they
were dumb it was not until later when i
met in the wild hills a little band of macusi
indians from guayana inglesa and talked
with them that i was told of that myste-
rious trade in bullets and gold at the cuyuni
which caused the name the thirty gang

  but i can tell you senores that that
small force would be a terrible machine to
fight against in its own hills and any
expedition that ever tries to force its way
to the lair of black white had best make its
peace with god before it starts

  so now i know what the thirty gang
is but there is another thing which i do
not know and probably never shall learn
what was it in the mind of that half-mad
black white that drove him down the
ventuari again to help me fight my foes

  it was not because yaracuma asked it
the wishes of an indian capitdn are nothing
to him i do not believe it was friendship

  to me for i am the man who led him to his
doom though it was through no fault of
mine that he met it neither can i feel
that it was because i had fought for him in
the past he was always ungrateful

  can it be that he told me truth on that
last night in his mocking talk and that he
really acted for the sake of the girl who
wanted me is it possible that memory
tortures him now with the tears and heart-
aches and despair of girls whose trust he
betrayed in other days and that now he
would atone for his wrongs by aiding an
indian maid to win happiness in love or
was it only the blood-call of a fierce animal
driving him to a killing that brought him
down to my cano

  i do not know it might be either or
both or neither one such a mind as his is
in the hands of god-or of the devil it is
one more of those puzzles which the great
hills of the land of falling waters hold
and for which there is no answer

trade jargon

by clarence hutchinson

       t is erroneous to think of the
         north american indians as be-
         ing a nomadic people each
         division held certain territory

quite definitely marked by natural boun-
daries and there were no haphazard wan-
derings outside this area unless the adven-
turers were looking for a tribal war there
are many american citizens who think of
indians as being all alike in language and
customs this is as great a fallacy as to
imagine a continent parceled off among en-
glish french russians germans swedes
and so on and to expect the different peo-
ples to speak with a common tongue

  however despite the dissimilarity of lan-
guages the continent was threaded with
trade routes shells from the pacific coast
would be traded from tribe to tribe far
east of the mississippi river eastern mer-
chandise found its way to the far west
as two tribes might live side by side and
even intermarry without either acquiring
any proficiency in the language of the other
and inasmuch as the well-defined trade
routes passed through the lands of many
different divisions the trade language or
jargon naturally developed

  the mobilian trade language a corrupted
choctaw jargon and also known as the
chickasaw trade language was in use
from the florida and louisiana tribes up
the mississippi valley as far as the mouth
of the ohio the comanche language was
much employed by neighboring tribes for
trade purposes as the comanches were
great travelers and introduced their speech
to many tribes

  in the columbia river region and along
the coast from california to alaska the
common trade medium of speech is called
the chinook jargon the whites first
met with it in the fur-trade days in 
and added to its various indian elements
words from the european languages

  the universal trade language in trans-
mississippi tribes has been a silent one the
sign language once on a time this speech
by gesticulation existed east of the missis-
sippi the kiowas crows and cheyennes
were best versed in this language of gestures
less expert were tribes living east and west
of the central plains area such as the 
omaha kansas and osage and other mis-
souri tribes and the utes and shoshoni in
the mountains

ews of the murder
caupee neilson at
pers shack back in
nedluk country had

nas-

trap-

of
his
the lake
set fort

chimo in a ferment what time the white-
coats would be on the pans in the ungava
bay or the cod would come in or what men
the swilers had picked up on their way
down north to seal-ice were topics for-
gotten

  not that a death or a violent death was
a rare thing on the ungava coast or in the
savage uplands but nascaupee neilson
was an old-timer the chantey fiddler at the
fort during the spring and fall gatherings
the most jovial and likable mixture of
french and scotch on the koksoak

  only the most meager details had leaked
out neilson had been stabbed to death
a week before presumably for his furs
he had shot a black fox late in january
the fox was gone two arrests had been
made thad macoun and larry scott
were in the butter-tub for safe-keeping

  the assistant-factor bent avery had
kept his own counsel about the murder
lie had made a trip up the koksoak to
neilsons cabin investigated and returned
that morning

  in the open bastion of the fort under the
warm spring sun fishermen who should
have been working on their twines and

  sealers who should have been swatching
white-coats out on the bay ice were gath-
ered to hear what bent avery had to report
on the wicket of the store-ropm a notice had
been posted that the assistant-factor would
report at two oclock he was then in the
butter-tub questioning macoun and scott

  there was a sprinkling of montaignais
and micmacs in the gathering and an
umiak load of innuits had come in for
trading but the heavy majority of the
sixty men in the bastion were livyere
fishermen and trappers who had known
nascaupee neilson for years and were
there on grim business which they too kept
strictly to themselves

  promptly at two oclock the heavy side
door of the bastion opened and bent
avery stepped into the court-yard he was
a medium-tall man slender with high
bald forehead tight lips and steady gray
eyes fort gossip had him a bookish
man during his odd hours the livyeres
to whom he nodded doffed their dickey-
hoods respectfully under his arm he
carried a mannlicher-schoenauer repeating-
rifle and around his waist was a full
cartridge-belt

  he laid the rifle on a heavy block table
near the door leaned on his knuckles and
spoke to the men in a low even voice-
free from the burr of the labrador


the seventh man



  ive been up to neilsons cabin i
investigated the murder there also ive
questioned macoun and scott im ready
to report to you men

  first understand i am bossing this
affair from beginning to end i know what
some of you have been saying and wanting
to do all your spruce-limb parties
couldnt find out for sure who killed nas-
caupee neilson ive taken the affair into
my hands and ill enforce order-and pro-
tect the murderer-with this if necessary

  he tapped the magazine of his rifle

  there was a growl of surliness in the
crowd avery noticed it the lines about
his mouth tightened but he went on
evenly

  there were but two ways of finding
out the murderer the first was to find
positive proof or evidence pointing straight
at one man the other was to eliminate
all the men who might have committed
the crime and have just the murderer
left there was no positive clue in neil-
sons cabin or about the place not one
positive clue so i had to suspect all the
men whose cabins were within reach of
nascaupee neilsons not counting ma-
coun and scott there were five trappers
who could have done the stabbing ill
ask these men to step forward

  match guernsey

  a tall raw-boned livyere elbowed his
way out of the crowd he made a sorry
attempt at grinning when he sat down
on the end of the bench his cheeks
flushed beneath their bronze and he
breathed heavily

  rob mcrae

  a second livyere younger and dressed
jauntily stepped forward and sat beside
guernsey

  carcajou sul walters

  there was a movement in the center of
the crowd a small frail-loolcing man of
fifty appeared crossed the open space with
quick rabbit-like steps and sat beside
mcrae

  pierre chouart

  a half-breed wood-loper on the fringe
of the crowd started at the sound of his
name said something in angry french and
stepped nervously forward

  and burt calloway

  a man of forty heavy-built stocky
with a livid knife-scar sprawled across his
face grunted and stumped up to the bench

  when calloway was seated avery moist-
ened his lips

  i said there was not one positive clue
in the cabin of nascaupee neilson there
was a clue of a sort it was left behind
to cover up the crime to throw the blame
upon an innocent person that is the
sole clue i had to work with

  at a signal from the assistant-factor a
fort guard opened the bastion door and led
scott and macoun out still handcuffed
they sat down on the bench there was
an angry stir in the group of livyeres-a
seething restlessness word had got out
that macounwas guilty beyond a doubt
and that scott was implicated by his own
confession

  if i had thought said avery noting
the temper of the crowd that discovery
of the murderer would make law-breakers
and murderers out of sixty more men i
would not have turned a hand to find who
killed nascaupee neilson

  youse know who he is a livyere at
the back shouted tell us and we wont
waste any time

  put that man out avery commanded
no one stirred put him out bent
avery repeated or this meeting stops
right here

  three men escorted the hot-headed
livyere to the gate and ejected him

  the single clue in the shack was a small
kiliutok

  the assistant-factor held up a thin keen
skinning knife

  it belongs to larry scott he is to tell
us what he knows about the murder

scott got up from the bench and
spoke to the crowd

i passed nascaupees shack on my
fur path two mornins without seein any
smoke t third momin i went in he
wuz layin dead on t floor with a kiliutok
beside im that kiliutok i knowed bet-
tern my own i couldnt believe tj man
who owned that knife ud kill nascaupee
but there it wuz with blood all over
mine wuznt different from three dozen
others-just an ordinary store skinnin-
knife i left it there an took t other
kiliutok away an then reported

  bent avery nodded confirmation as
scott sat down the mans words carried
conviction even with the suspicious crowd
there was a hush of expectancy as avery


adventure

held up a second much larger and highly
carved knife

  this is the weapon scott found beside
neilson and which he took away with him
he turned it over to me this knife- he
paused an impressive second-belongs to
thad macoun

  he turned to the liveyere on the near end
of the bench

do you admit this kiliutok is yours
macoun nodded too scared to speak
he was ashen-pale and his hands trembled

  then i think we may exonerate larry
scott from blame avery concluded to
keep a friend from being charged with
murder he endangered himself

  at a sign from the assistant-factor the
fort guard unlocked scotts handcuffs
the trapper joined the group one or two
shook hands with him

  thad macoun stand up and tell what
you know about the murder of nascaupee
neilson

  i know nothink macoun burst out
i wuz on my way back up t river t time
it happened i wuznt nowhere within
fifty miles of t lake

  avery nodded again

  the trade books show that macoun
was at the fort on the afternoon of the
fifteenth i distinctly remember macouns
trading neilson was killed that night or
sometime on the sixteenth it is a hun-
dred and sixty-seven miles up to neilsons
cabin by the river route and he couldnt
have gone through the deer bush with snow
piled over the top of it in other words
he was two days fast komatik travel away
macoun as he says couldnt have been
within fifty miles of the shack at the time
neilson met death

  macoun gulped as the fort guard un-
locked his handcuffs he started up to
shake hands with the assistant factor but
avery motioned to him to join the crowd
of livyeres not two or three but half
the group shook hands with him

  avery waited till the livyeres were
quiet again and went on

  of the seven men who trapped close
enough to lake nedluk five are left
one of the men on this bench killed nas-
coupee and left macouns knife behind to
throw the blame upon macoun the mur-
derer did not leave a single positive clue
hedid his work neatly if he had not
left this knife behind there would have

been no tracing him macoun how did
this kiliutok get out of your hands

  a bunch of us from t upper koksoak
came down to t fort on dogs t last
week in febrary macoun answered
we all started back t twenty-eighth at
midnight i had t kiliutok in t store-
room at ten oclock when i wanted to
cut a tangled trace as we buckled t dogs in
t knife wuz gone

  that means the knife was taken either
accidentally or purposely by some one
here at that time it must have been
taken with an eye to the murder the
kiliutok was a peculiar one everybody
knows it is macouns besides the word
had got out about neilsons thousand dol-
lar fox the murderer took the knife that
night meaning it should cover up his crime
later there are no trade records of that
visit to the fort is any one ready to
swear macoun told the truth

  a livyere held up his right hand

  t recordsll show i turned in some
marten on t twenty-eighth an took out
some goods tfust of march i remember
seein macoun pierre chouart calloway
sul walters scott an rob mcrae here
at t time

  you did not mention match guernsey
avery prompted

  the tall raw-boned liveyere on the end
of the bench rose up

  i come down with t party but i went
out to t coast to big island to see dad
meadows bout workin on his smack this
cod season i wuz with im t twenty-
eighth ant fust

  match guernsey left t evenin of t
fust meadows an old fisherman in the
crowd verified we worked on t twines
that whole day

  avery nodded

  then match guernsey could not have
taken the knife he was seventy-five
miles away

  guernsey got up awkwardly and joined
the other livyeres he was still trembling
from the ordeal of sitting on the bench
young mcrae tried to appear nonchalant
as he saw his turn was next he rose up at
a sign from avery

  rob mcrae was here the night the
kiliutok was stolen and he lives within
twenty miles of neilsons cabin on that
same lake avery continued i want
to point out one thing mcrae is macouns
the seventh man



trap-line partner he could hardly have
had the knife in his hands for two weeks
without macoun seeing it besides mc-
rae was macouns best friend when some
of you this morning were starting to break
into the butter-tub after macoun it was
mcrae who said he would shoot the first
man that climbed the wall if mcrae had
killed neilson he would have covered up
by some other way than laying the blame
upon macoun

  friends dont go in this deal a livyere
shouted that dont clear mcrae
true enough avery agreed i wasnt
through notice this the man who
killed neilson plainly didnt know macoun
was at the post at the time of the murder
or he wouldnt have left macouns knife
behind in the cabin but mcrae knew
where macoun was if rob mcrae had
a secret grudge against macoun there
wouldnt have been any point to his leaving
the knife in the cabin when he knew ma-
coun could prove his innocence and if
mcrae was still friends with macoun
would he have put the knife by neilsons
side either way you take it it lets mc-
rae out besides i believe mcrae has a
word to say for himself	f

  the young livyere wetted his lips

  i wuznt in t party that come down t
koksoak t last week in febrary t fust
of febrary i come down with sul walters
for flour an carcajou pison jay-bird
willett had got his lungs nipped so i took
his place an carried t mail across to he-
bron and back i got in t fust of march
just a couple hours after t bunch had
started back up triver nobody saw me
with tother men i went back up t
river with match guernsey after he come
back from big island

  besides all the other evidence tending
to clear mcrae avery summed up
there is this last point to prove that he
had no chance to steal the kiliutok mcrae
is eliminated

  the young livyere jumped off the bench
with alacrity and joined macoun at the
edge of the group the three men on the
bench moved apart carcajou sul wal-
ters teeth chattered as avery motioned to
him to stand up he was a little fellow
bald thin and wizened

  it isnt thinkable that carcajou would
try to stab a man as big and strong as
nascaupee avery began nascaupee

was stabbed in the breast face to face with
the murderer carcajou would have tried
some other way in neilsons cabin i
found a sack of flour half-used neilson
bought no flour since november so he had
to borrow it that sack was in a serial lot
i traced it to sul walters he bought it the
time he came down with rob mcrae
he loaned neilson that sack if he had
wanted to kill nascaupee he would have
put strychnine in the flour

  every last one of you seven have car-
cajou poison at your shacks and every last
one of you had a chance to put it in neil-
sons flour so carcajou would have been
taking no chances stabbing a bear of a
man like neilson would have been the last
thing he would have tried besides-
avery smiled for the first and last time-
we know carcajou

  there was a murmur of approval when
the little man padded across and was
swallowed up in the crowd match guern-
sey summed up opinion when he said-

  nascaupee ud have said boo-hoo an
blowed real hard an blowed t runt into
t lake

  the two men left on the bench were in
a nervous rigor the half-breed wood-
loper pierre chouart had thrown back
his dickey-hood and was running his
twisted fingers through his long black
hair his lips moved he talked to himself
under his breath after the habit of the
man who lives alone in the deer bush

  the stocky livyere burt calloway sat
at the far end of the bench his face was
ashen the knife scar had become a red
weal across his face his eyes were upon
the hushed crowd

  the livyeres had followed averys logic
and evidence with gasps of surprize
they had hung upon his word and ap-
proved each acquittal but avery knew
the supreme test of his power over them
was come

he picked up the mannlicher-
schoenauer from the block and
threw it into the hollow of his arm
coolly he ran his thumb and forefinger
around his cartridge-belt

  before eliminating the last man and
leaving the murderer alone on the bench
he eased the terrific strain with a few
words

  i want to point out he rehearsed


adventure

how every last acquittal has centered about
this kiliutok how all lines of evidence run
to it it is possible to cover up a crime
too well the murderer i repeat left the
kiliutok behind to throw the blame upon
another man thad macoun that was
his only slip because of that kiliutok i
have been able to eliminate to your satis-
faction five of the seven men

  laisscz pierre chouart groaned al-
lons bent avery

  im coming to it the assistant-factor
replied

  he held up the mmder-kiliutok again
pierre chouart give me your skinning-
knife you have it in your belt-sheath
the wood-loper unbuckled the sheath
and tossed it to avery the assistant-
factor took the knife out of the sheath
put the two kiliutoks behind him shuffled
them and laid them on the table

  larry scott you found macouns knife
in the cabin and had it with you almost a
week you ought to know it come here
and pick it out

  scott stepped forward picked up the
knives and studied them for a full minute
he shook his head

   i cant theys identical

  pierre chouart swore luridly and crossed
himself avery held up his hand for silence
among the livyeres

  those two knives are identical the
blades are exactly alike the handles are of
walrus ivory carved in micmac fashion
there is not a single mark of difference
that i can discover both are the handi-
work of pierre chouart perhaps others
of you are wearing different knives that
chouart carved macoun bought his knife
from chouart how many others like
these did you carve pierre chouart

  but those two the wood-loper spoke
up they each took a month of evenings
bent avery

  thad macoun can you tell which
kiliutok is yours

  macoun stepped forward examined the
knives with wrinkled brow and held one up

  this is mine its worn a bit at t
pint

  avery waited till macoun was back with
the other livyeres he shifted his rifle
toying with the magazine

  those two knives are so alike that the
owners can scarcely tell them apart and
the rest of us would say they are identical

pierre chouart made both of them and
could have made another furthermore
he wore his kiliutok to the fort in his
belt-sheath in plain view of us all if
he had stabbed neilson with macouns
kiliutok-

   bent avery never finished his sentence
calloway who had been sitting as if
turned to stone screamed leaped to his
feet jumped upon the bench and sprang
for the top of the bastion wall the crowd
as one man bellowed and surged forward

  quick as calloway was pierre chouart
was quicker he had risen to his feet
following bent averys every word and
action hypnotized calloways action
broke the spell lynx-like the wood-
loper leaped at the stocky trapper caught
him in mid-air as calloways hands were
outstretched for the top of the wall and
they fell heavily to the ground clawing and
struggling like panthers

  bent avery vaulted lightly upon the
table and threw his rifle to his shoulder
his voice was scarcely louder than it had
been always

  right there stop he snapped -

you thad macoun ill drop you the first
one stop stay back 

  at the click of the mannlicher-schoen-
auer macoun stopped he was in the
lead the others stopped but avery saw
they were going to rush him and the two
struggling men

  match guernsey he cried you
jump in and help chouart the rest of
you-back-you

  the gesture and the words were magic
the livyeres stopped as one of their own
number jumped in and helped truss up
calloway

  get on back out of reach avery
ordered again

  nerveless and terrified calloway had
broken when the slow moving finger had
written his name on the wall to averys
ears came the babble of calloway cursing
and snarling his confession bent avery
knew better than to let the livyeres hear

  when chouart and guernsey had dis-
appeared through the bastion wall door bent
avery dropped his rifle butt upon his foot

   i want to thank you for being so orderly
and collected while i showed you who
killed nascaupee neilson he said dryly

   there was a trace of irony in his cool
even voice

jbssr edll-adaztur



 adams says doesnt look
  sa a bit good to me old-timer it
  j looks as though the silly blighter
 thought a bit too much of his
 nonsensical self altogether

   i am one of the gang-one of the woolly
 sheep whose fleeces are sooty rather than
 snow-white i havent any desire at all to
 orate to teach to philosophize-all my de-
 sire is to be a human man with a mans red
 human heart and that love for his fellows
 whoever they may be that may yet at
 some far far day perhaps go far to the
 unravelment of the tangle in which we dwell
 life at the best is a hard matter to face
 and an affair that calls for much of courage

    courage alone wont win us through one
 has got to have a large share of humility
 and of inner consciousness that it is not one
 self that counts at all but that it is the whole
 race i can not see that there is any great
 worth in those things of which men speak
 so cherishingly-fame and fortune honor
 and such renowns as come to one from ones
 fellows the fact is i suppose that theres
 a something greater calling than just this
 present battle of today-today being but
 a road through a forest and leading to a
 cliff top whence our vision shall be brighter

   bill adams says-what says if you
 will that he is very conscious that he is a
 small grain of dust wind-borne along the
 throbbing gale that echoes with the strife
 of mortal toward immortality

    no please dont say that i say anything
 ive nothing to say i have a smile not
 always easy to show though and a hand
 for any brother who wants it to boost him
 along a step or so too many men have
 made of religion a lie thus the word religion
 is come to be a hated word amongst those
 hard sons of earth who know earths hard
 ways of open manliness and knowing them
 scorn the easy religions of the folk who chant
 from the safety of the church steps true
 religion is deep i think in the soul of each
 one of us i havent often met a man devoid
 of reverence ive seen old drunken sailors
 old rough port profligates stand awed at the
 bright sight of the dawn upon a rosy tinted
 iceberg in the grim antarctic-as though in
 the presence of utter beauty they bowed in

  bill adams says- copyright  by bill adams	

the presence of ultimate grandeur sensing
the quiet echo of the voice of our unknown
creator

  bill adams says nothing old man but
as god dwells in a place of merciful beauty
he thinks a deal and would that he might
think more clearly

  lifes a queer deal ive seen some very
terrible things indeed

  ive seen the dregs of it and the heights
also-bright heights

  how shall i say words as though wisely
amongst my brothers wisdom is all too
often a cloud of dust on a freak wind and
passes without meaning or refreshment to
any one along lifes roadways

  a friendship mingled with a humility
with the yearning for a courageous heart-
heaven grant them to me to us all

  but dont say bill adams says-for he
is less than no one at all

  two days ago i drove to berkeley now
but eighty-eight miles or so from my home
i picked up an aged hobo on my way he
sat beside me with his old boots upon his
tawny blanket-bundle his ancient pipe
puffing smoke and his queer old puckered
eyes looking straight ahead of us

  youre a perfec gentleman sir said he
to every remark i made and added youre
right sir-youre right for sure

  i took him right on to the end of my
journey and at the very gate of the great
university opened the door and said-
well old-timer heres a fine place for
the likes of you-a place as fine and fit as
any other

  he got out all frayed and battered he
slung his tawny blanket-roll over his old
shoulders and waved a friendly hand to me
the ancient pipe tight clutched in his
crooked fingers

  youre right sir-youre right for sure
said he and added youre a perfec
gentleman sir

  i laughed and called to him-

  good luck to you old-timer

  what does it matter what bill adams
says its what folks do that counts to the
hanger of the stars and the tuner of the
sea-winds

   is it not
author of breed of the brush

henever i think of that jury
room reeking of pipes and
cigarets with the big oil lamp
suspended from the ceiling
burning a sickly yellow hole in that fog of
smoke and red-eyed heavy-lidded men
breathing shrilly as they stared drunkenly
at the one man who had held them in this
hole since three oclock yesterday afternoon
i find myself shaking my head as if that
physical effort would throw out the picture
its a nightmare

  it was stifling hot-choking stupefying
the chairs were hard-too hard to sleep in
too hard to rest in they were made to force
verdicts yet zukoff held out and kept us
here we had played cards sung swapped
yarns but that was before midnight now
every man was suffering one dared not
speak to another for two hours eleven
men had sat staring red-eyed contemptu-
ously with murder in their hearts for the
little man who would not yield it was
maddening

  he sat on my right side at that bare
whittled and cigaret-charred table stub-
bornly immobile of countenance his elbow
on the table and his broad bulging forehead
supported on the heel of his begrimed hand
his little blue eyes were full of a melancholy
calmness as they looked through the gold-
rimmed spectacles at some undecipherable

initials carved on the table directly under
his nose his hair was thick and black and
curly yet he stooped like an old man i
found myself idly wondering if all lock-
smiths stooped and if there were anything
peculiar to the trade which made for a
maddening obstinacy to characterize its
clan for any child could have heard that
testimony and known the man was as guilty -
as cain yet zukoff held out

  look here i said to him you are
a sensible man

  he turned those little blue eyes on me
yes i am very sensible that is why
i am going to sit right in this chair until the
judge lets us go home and calls in another
jury to hang the feller

  but you dont know this judge i
pleaded hell just keep us locked up
forever until we dot

  then maybe i will spend the rest of my
life sitting in this chair he paused and
sighed they are always mixing me up
in such a business he said bitterly let
me vote it to hang that feller and before i
could get back to my shop my throat would
be cut or maybe my wife was bombed
this isnt russia i said angrily such
things dont happen over here and in-
wardly i cursed the man who had drawn
this creature for jury service

  he looked at me accusingly


 zukoff fits a key

k



  my friend i tell you to ask my wife
she will tell you strange things happen by
this country you should ask me if worse
things come off than in russia

  oh - snarled the heavy-jowled

foreman who had overheard

  he dropped his head on his arms that
were folded on the table and began to snore
the others were not listening what with
the foulness of that air the fearful strain
of that deadlock they were too stupid to
do more than doze fitfully between vindic-
tive glares at the little bent obstructionist
at my side

  nicholas zukoff lighted a pungent cigaret
and once more turned to me now there
was a deep wistfulness in his eyes

  my friend he said in guarded voice
i will tell you something

  one by one the jurors had succumbed
the locksmith and i were the only ones
awake he looked around the room to
reassure himself of that fact and then he
began to speak with a low earnestness now
and then pausing to receive my encouraging
nods one year ago on this very night it
had happened this is as i remember it

no i wouldnt take them a-tall
nicholas zukoff rubbed his nose
with the back of his metal-smudged
hand then turned to the flashily dressed
young gentleman who dangled before his
gaze a panel of dummy book-backs

  fifty cents down and fifty cents a week
sniffed the locksmith and why should i
pay you the price of two key jobs down for
cash and hand you the price of two more
every week for the rest of my life i
dont want books i am too busy at my
business

  the salesman gave a finicky touch to his
yellow-and-blue tie

  you hadnt ought to turn me down like
this mr zukoff it aint every day my
house puts out such a gilt-edge proposition
you couldnt buy these fifteen vol-yumes
for twicet the price if you was to purchase
them singly one at a time yunderstand

besides mr zukoff-

  poosh exploded the locksmith and
why should i work to pay you these fifty
cents for a lot of stuff what a feller makes
up out of his head mr feinberg rather
i would read the newspaper to know what
is going on

  aint you american

  the locksmith took off his spectacles the
better to squint at his persecutor

  you ask me am i american what do
i look like anyway

  well mr zukoff i thought maybe you
might be russ yunderstand

  and what of it next door lives wong
fu by his laundry next to him is pop-
parlados shoe shop what comes from
greece and on the other side is bissanos
delicatessen what took part in the war in
the alps and epsteins pressing palace-
suppose it i do come from kief mr fein-
berg which is exactly the condition aint
i american

  no harm mr zukoff the agent hur-
ried to say i was just about to tell you
mr zukoff that like as you are american
these books is all about america and you
ought to read them you say you read the
paper to find what is coming off these
adventures by lifes highway is coming
off every minute only the papers aint
smart enough to know it

  now frinstence mr zukoff heres two
fellers what was young men together when
it comes time for them to leave home and
paddle their own rowboat-because yun-
derstand their fathers is sick and tired of
supporting them all their life-they make
it a promus between them to meet right
on that corner across the street exactly ten
years from date

  mr feinberg paused mr zukoff
squinted at the corner mentioned

  so when that night comes continued
the pest one of em was a cop living in this
very town the other feller was a bum
but the cop went to that corner as per
agreement and soons he seen his friend he
knew his friend was wanted by the police
and the bum didnt recognize the cop
yunderstand

  poosh exclaimed the exasperated
locksmith what a lot of words you
make it

  so what does that cop do dramatically
asked mr feinberg mr zukoff what
does he do

  i should worry my head about what he
would do

  hurt his good friends feelings by pinch-
ing him like that cried mr feinberg
no he walks away and pulls the patrol-
box-thats what he does and his friend
never knew who done for him now the
papers didnt have that mr zukoff this


adventure

libry is packed full of such beautiful
adventures

  the locksmith began to file industriously
on the key

  stands by this corner-this very corner
where that bum was pinched-a man he
said if you was to come in here mr
feinberg and say to me mr zukoff what
time is it and i was to look out and see
that feller standing there id wait a minute
then if he threw some crums to the birds
what comes every day by that comer id
say mr feinberg its exactly two-twenty
sharp and you could betcher it aint a
second before or later either

  the salesman nodded

  yes but as i was saying mr zukoff-
hold on now if this feller what wrote
it about your cop and bum was to see that
feller throwing crums to birds every day
at two-twenty sharp-like i watched him
every day for six months-what would this
writer feller do he would write a whole
book about this great adventure

  but if your writer feller was to come
here and ask me mr zukoff what do you
think about a feller standing there at two-
twenty sharp every day and feeding birds
id say he is just a nut which he is what he
is and what i aint otherwise mr fein-
berg i might pay you that fifty cents down
and let you take my name for a sucker

  but these adventures mr zu-

  poosh and suppose it when i found
my wife sitting on my shop door over in
bleecker street-before i moved it over
here-she wasnt my wife then-crying like
a peasant girl from the volga country
which is the exact condition because she
was just landed and was lost from her
relations suppose this writer feller had seen
that i guess hed write two books about
that which is because he aint practical
but for me here was a good wife sitting
right on my shop door and so i took her
and i aint never stopped work to hunt for
her relations what she lost when she landed
mr feinberg because i dont need any
more relations thats because im prac-
tical mr feinberg and wouldnt waste any
more time on that adventure business

  the agent folded his dummy walked out
and slammed the door then mr zukoff
bent over his work and filed furiously

  theres a loafer for you he addressed
his wife without turning round

  she was dimly visible in the rear of the

shop an eyeshade hiding the upper half
of her face as she worked at a key in the
light of a gas jet a russ too he added
in a tone of humiliation his wifes only
reply was a vigorous filing

  just to show you said nicholas zu-
koff when he had reached this point that
a man never knows when he is sitting on a
volcano

  after a while a sunbeam touched his vise
whereupon mr zukoff looked up from his
work

  i betcher he muttered its almost
two-twenty he peered across the street
at a man standing on the corner thats
him

  mr zukoff watched the fellow closely
expectantly zukoff scowled the man was
crossing the street

  he aint thrown a crum gasped the
locksmith hes coming to this shop

  he heard his wifes filing cease abruptly
and the tool clatter on the floor some
supper burns she called rushing through
the rear of the shop

  the man had entered

  are you nicholas zukoff he asked
the locksmith was too amazed to answer
such a deep reverberating voice to come
from the interior of such a miserable little
man the fellow was tall lean-so lean
that zukoff believed he was half-starved
the cheek bones seemed about to break
through the chalk-white skin the blue
eyes were sunken restless penetrating the
nose as sharp as an eagles beak in the
long unkempt black hair some gray was
showing

  yes finally said mr zukoff i am
you open locks when keys are lost
maybe was the cautious answer
when did you lost it

  i dont know but i want you to open
it tonight

  if i got to go by night said zukoff it
is two dollars

  good said the sepulchral voice ill
come for you at nine oclock

  and besides hastened the locksmith
i dont open no locks a-tall what aint
got the right

  dont worry about that

  zukoff nodded

  nobody can throw dirt in my eyes
mr-

  and even then i was a blind man
hissed the locksmith
zukoff fits a key-



 nussbaum is my name	

  nobody can throw dirt in my eyes mr
nussbaum and by the way mr nuss-
baum you didnt throw any crums to them
birds today did you mr nussbaum

  the look that the stranger gave zukoff
made the locksmith shrink back and pale

  no harm mr nussbaum only mr
nussbaum when a man what works by this
shop sees a feller throw crums to them
birds every day at two-twenty sharp mr
nussbaum he had ought to get used to it
which is the exact condition mr
nussbaum

  every man has a right to throw crums
to birds was the sullen reply he went
to the door then turned remember
nine oclock

  the locksmith stared after him

that night as zukoff sat down
to supper with his wife between
mouthfuls he analyzed the events
of the day

  and just like i said to that adventure
feller this morning he expanded them
writer fellers would make him throwing
crums to them birds for a great reason
irma on the other hand just like this
nut says to me irma this is a free country
and every man has got it the right to throw
anything he wants unless it is bumbs or
bricks

  throughout this monolog his wife had
stared at liim fascinated as yet she had
not tasted food when he ceased speaking
she picked nervously with her fork at a
boiled potato she was much younger than
zukoff her figure was good her eyes a
deep blue she would have been prettier
but for her bobbed hair

  all the same she finally said with an
accent which her husband had nearly lost
i wish you didnt promise to go two
dollars is two dollars but what would be
two dollars if you was stabbed

  alwajs it is the same cried zukoff
i betcher all your relations is dead long
ago scared to death by things that never
come off always it is the same by you-
watching every man what comes in this
shop to bring me business like he was paying
calls to cutthroats

  terrible things happen by this coun-
try irma answered in awed whisper

  afraid to go even to bissanos delicates-
sen unless you are grabbing my arm-

  all the time womens is stole

  always working in the back of the shop
by the gas while i work in the front where
the light comes free

  the sun it hurts my eyes

  it is always the same by the volga
people and your hair he wailed it
was the pride of my life when i married
you then you cut it off if you aint
miserable yourself you try to make me
miserable look at you right now-pale
like i was a ghost talking to you out of my
grave i am a practical man i dont
have imaginations and i hope i never get
none

  there the meal ended his wife had not
tasted food

  promptly at nine cadaverous nussbaum
entered the shop as zukoff sat reading the
evening paper under the flickering gaslight
irma had bolted herself in behind their
bed-room door

  well said zukoff you come on time
dont you mr nussbaum

  if you are ready was the nervous an-
swer let us go

  zukoff put on his hat and picked up the
heavy satchel bulging with keys and files
he followed nussbaum through the shop
to the curb there stood a taxicab its
engine running before mr zukoff could
question nussbaum gave him a shove into
the cab slammed the door and they were
off bouncing and banging over the cobbles
for half an hour they traveled zukoff was
lost then the taxi stopped and nussbaum
dragged the locksmith to the street

  come along he whispered seizing
zukoffs arm

  he conducted the now thoroughly fright-
ened man through a hedge across a tre-
mendous lawn around to the rear of a
tremendous house nussbamn knocked
guardedly on a door immediately it
opened and in the doorway zukoff beheld
the silhouette of a powerful man of flowing
black beard

  you come on time nussbaum whom
do you bring

  nussbaum shoved the locksmith inside
a friend to help zukoff this is mr leo
pinsk the caretaker

  zukoff stared about him at the magnifi-
cence of the furnishings

  without a word pinsk led the way into
utter darkness the locksmith clutched
nussbaums sleeve as they passed through


adventure

great spaces where footfalls were silenced
by the lush deep pile of the rugs which
covered the floors they mounted a great
stairs then zukoff felt himself in a new
room delicately scented with a rare per-
fume a click and lights flooded the scene
zukoff gasped in wonder

  the room was tremendous priceless
rugs covered the floor the walls were ivory-
paneled to the height of his shoulders then
tapestried to the ceiling the furnishings
were in ivory and gold the ivory-and-gold
canopied bed struck him speechless with awe

  now said the giant pinsk crossing to
a wall-panel here is the lock

  but nicholas zukoff stood still

  i aint going to open it he cried to-
day i told you nussbaum i wouldnt open

no locks that-

  we have every right said nussbaum
how do i know it how do i know who
you are-or this feller pinsk he speaks a
fine russ and that is all i do know

  i am the caretaker said pinsk smiling
this is the home of the countess saminoff
she is away with the count for the summer
the countess has some letters behind this
panel which our friend nussbaum has every
right to examine

  then exclaimed zukoff you got to
wait till this countess comes back from her
vacation and sends for me

  you will save yourself much trouble
said the big russian

  zukoff gulped and turned sickly pale
he was looking down the muzzle of a tre-
mendous automatic leveled in pinsks hand
please open this lock

  the locksmith looked appealingly to
nussbaum the latter nodded

  he means what he says zukoff

  limply zukoff knelt beside his satchel
with shaking hands drew out a great chain
of keys

  right here pinsk indicated with the
blue muzzle heres the lock

  zukoff saw the tiny hole he tried a
key it would not fit he tried another
it fitted but would not turn he tried a
dozen while the chain of keys jingled musi-
cally in his shaking hands when the lock
turned with a refined little click he stepped
back aghast at what he had done

  pinsk swung open the panel reached in
and drew out a packet of letters bound with
lavender ribbon nussbaum breathing
shrilly reached out for them the care-

taker held them behind his back and shook
his head

  one moment he said quietly

  he retreated several paces laid the auto-
matic on the dressing-table and whipped
a letter from the packet he opened it
glanced hurriedly at its contents

  i am afraid there has been a mistake
he said apologetically raising his eyes from
the letter to nussbaums livid features
the handwriting does resemble your own
as i told you nussbaum but these letters
are from one anton harowitz so we have
had all our trouble for nothing

  nussbaums eyes seemed to sink deeper
in his head he had turned white again

  they are mine he said in a voice like
a hollow groan

  i tell you frowned pinsk they are
from one harowitz

  my name is harowitz

  what do you say exclaimed pinsk
harowitz then why have you called
yourself nussbaum

  the cadaverous mans lips were blue
great veins swelled in his forehead

  pinsk it was as if he spoke into an
empty barrel it had to be in america
i am nussbaum in russia harowitz to
the countess i am harowitz now will you
give me the letters

  what childs tale is this growled the
mastiff pinsk without beginning or end
i do not deal with liars

  i am no liar wildly cried the man
those letters will prove that the countess

tricked me-that she is my sonia-

  it is i who have been tricked said
pinsk accusingly did you apply for work
in this house that you might spy on her

  i wanted to see her nussbaum was
wringing his hands that is all i had
heard this count had married in america-
heard how beautiful she was-like my
sonia perspiration was gathering on his
forehead

  pinsk put the letters into his coat pocket
that will be enough he said angrily
as one countryman for another i offered
to let you see these letters but this has
gone too far i do not deal with black-
mailers

  pinsk moaned nussbaum beating his
breast with his fists i am no blackmailer
i swear to you i met this peasant girl in
moscow

  and you think she could marry a count
zukoff fits a key-



  a king cried the man she is beauti-
ful enough i saw her only once-ah the
glory of her being i desired her more than
life and fool that i was i told her my
real name-harowitz then i was ordered
here to sow the seeds of liberty

  he was speaking in russian zukoff
stood rooted to the persian rug his eyes
starting from his head a practical unimagi-
native locksmith who found himself plunged
into the very vortex of terrible mystery

  i came here nussbaum was saying
passionately the desire for her was con-
suming me-i must have her i wrote to
her we exchanged many letters-those
he pointed a bony finger at pinsk i
begged her to come here and marry me i
sent her the money a friend forged her
passport she wrote she would come

  the cadaverous man paused brushed the
perspiration from his eyes

  she was coming to me-and how could
i meet her they were hunting me here
as harowitz she would call out that name
when she saw me at the gate and that
would be the end

  then i wrote to her warning her never
to breathe that name i would not meet
her ship but every day for two months
after she sailed i would stand on a certain
comer at a certain time and cast crums
to the birds in that way she could find
me and it would be safe

  mr zukoffs knees buckled he went
down on them white as death neither
man glanced at him

  and so i waited for my sonia every
day i have waited on that comer-for six
months hoping to feel her touch on my

arm hear her voice-

  he ground his teeth savagely swallowed
audibly

  she never came-this dog of a count
stole her i knew it all when you told me
about those letters i want them to prove
it and when i have done that he con-
cluded in so calm a tone that zukoffs
teeth began to chatter i shall cut out
both their hearts

  pinsks hand swept the automatic from
the dressing-table now it was nussbaum
who glared into its muzzle

  harowitz said the big russian there
is a gentleman under the bed who will make
an excellent translation of your confession
into english

  with a hollow cry the man wheeled

from under that gorgeous canopied bed a
coatless collarless man was crawling

  a reglar a-number-one confession he
wheezed getting up and mopping his facc
with a handkerchief wasnt made under
no compulsion neither was it mr zukoff
the locksmith could utter no sound the
room seemed to tilt terrifyingly before the
eyes of the miserable man who stared agape
at the red perspiring countenance of the
loquacious mr feinberg that book agent

  it was a madmans bellow that sounded
in the trapped mans throat straight at
pinsk he came lunging with a hand clutching
a slender blade mr zukoff closed his eyes
while icy streamlets coursed down his back
he was conscious of a terrible scuffling sound
when he opened his eyes again nussbaum
lay on his back his wrists bound together in
the cold clutch of handcuffs and feinberg
was completing the mopping of his face

  speaking of them adventures along lifes
highway he was addressing the locksmith
mr zukoff i assure you this aint nothin
to what youll find in them vol-yumes

  the big russian stood looking down at
the captive it was an impersonal look he
gave the man as if he was thinking of other
things suddenly he shifted his eyes to
zukoff and smiled

  it may interest you to know he said
that mr feinberg planned this it was
his idea to have me get this man to apply
in writing for a position here that gave me
an excuse to talk about letters we had
suspected he was harowitz and we had wind
of the disappearance of some girl who was
to have married him harowitz walked
straight into the trap and also he added
you have done nothing wrong tonight
that was my own wifes cabinet you
opened i am the count saminoff when-
ever i can assisting this government to rid
itself of such creatures as harowitz and
mr feinberg is-well it is getting late

  he drew a bank-note from his pocket
and thrust it into the locksmiths hand

  zukoff rose weakly to his feet staggered
into the hallway which suddenly blazed
with light

it was very late indeed when
nicholas zukoff found his shop and
wabbled through it to the bedroom
when irma unbolted the door and saw his
face she gave a little cry then stood trem-
bling in her nightdress


adventure

  what did he do she finally managed
to articulate

  mr zukoff collapsed in a chair irma
found her strength rushed for the kiimmel
zukoff drained the glass a little color
crept back into his cheeks then words
negotiated the passage of his throat he
told the tragic tale

  when it was concluded he looked up
from the floor to his wife standing there
before him

 and he will be locked behind a
prison she gasped while her bosom
rose and fell tumultuously locked up-
forever

  exported zukoff shouted it back
to moscow

  wildly she was clapping her hands her
eyes had become sparkling sapphires

  my nicholas she cried

  irma shouted zukoff sitting bolt up-
right what is happening

  she was down on her knees clasping him
in smothering embrace

  curse all the days i have worked in the
shadows of the shop she was sobbing
hysterically now i shall work in the

front by your side and you shall see my
hair grow long again always afraid he
would find me and kill me for marrying you
when i could not find him that day-

  irma

  bless the day i got lost on bleecker
street harowitz will never find me now
a countess she laughed wildly him to
think your sonia could win a count

it was day when zukoff con-
cluded wiping the perspiration from
his forehead the jurors still slept
like drunkards the lamp above still burned
in that foul air but the chill of dawn had
crept into the room and zukoff shivered

  and so he whispered i shall sit in
this chair until i die before i say to hang
that man who is he i do not know
a man of a thousand friends who will strike
me down in the dark-maybe my own
brother maybe yours who knows any-
thing i who did not know my own wife
i who laughed at a book-agent only to find
him again in a red nightmare i laugh at
nothing doubt nothing i shall sit in this
chair until i die

true

  the guide said the black bear had greater
sagacity than almost any other quadruped

officers were told at a distance from his

it out with his forepaws and then return to

  john it must be admitted rather weak-

hunter into a cave

   the hunter in addition to his rifle of course
carried a torch instead of being a very dan-

would sit upright and hold his paws over
his face and eyes and remain motionless so

hough jimmy kerrill the second
mate of the medea had a tolerably
high opinion of his own merits and
as a direct result of his experiences
of tramp steamers their owners and crews
and water-front populations in general a
deep and abiding contempt for humanity in
the mass nevertheless a sense of humor
clean ideals the ability to hit quick and
often and to keep on hitting and a sturdy
independence of character had won for him
the respect and liking of his shipmates

  he was irish with all an irishmans
virtues and a few of his failings he was
lacking in tact he spoke his mind freely
he made enemies as easily as he made
friends he hated hypocrisy and bullying
and shams and graft and fat puffy unwhole-
some men who had more money than they
honestly deserved or could decently spend

  he was sorry for girls who imagined them-
selves in love with sailors or trusted them
too far he was sorry for the wives of most of
the men he knew he was sorry above all
for widows with babies and the fear of
poverty and the work-house gnawing at
their hearts

  and so nothing was more natural than
that jimmy kerrill being irish should have
picked a quarrel with the plump well

dressed man with the sleepy eyes and the
soft mouth and the little fair mustache
whom he saw one wet afternoon coming out
of an office building in cardiff the day be-
fore the medea was to sail

  there was an air of smug satisfaction and
conceit in the plump mans manner and
way of walking that aroused jimmys dis-
gust he followed him down the crowded
street wondering what the plump man had
done that had given him such an exagger-
ated idea of his own importance for no
man on earth could strut as this plump man
strutted without feeling in his heart what
a remarkably fine fellow he really was

  a little woman in black carrying in her
arms a baby who whimpered and having
another child a small girl clinging to her
skirt stood at the curb glancing from left
to right as if frightened jimmy halted
undecided whether he should go to her and
ask if he might help her across the street
then before he could make up his mind the
little woman in black shifted her baby into
the crook of her right arm and with her
left waved to a cab

  the driver nodded and a gap in the
traffic giving him his opportunity turned
and guided his cab to where the woman was
waiting

  before he had reached her however be-
fore he could stop the plump man with the


o

adventure

little fair mustache had bustled forward
and opened the door

  ah driver i want you to take me first
of all to the bank--

  it was at this moment that jimmy ker-
rill who had seen the plump mans attempt
to steal the cab from the woman with the
baby stepped forward and clasped his arm

  arent you making a mistake he
asked old horse youll have to wait

  what the-do you mean said the

plump man turning a wrathful face on
jimmy kerrill let go my arm

  but jimmys grasp tightened

  friend he said this lady- he jerked
his thumb toward the woman in black with
the two children-saw the taxi first isnt
that so driver

  and whatever the drivers regrets may
have been that he should be forced to forego
the chance of a tip such as the plump
gentleman might have been expected to
give for the sake of driving a shabby little
woman with a couple of kids to some out-
lying suburb nevertheless the driver ac-
knowledged that the brown-faced yellow-
haired young man with the grim look in his
blue eyes was correct the lady had seen
him fust he was goin to drive er or
no one

  see said jimmy i was right old
horse wasnt i

  he released the plump mans arm and
helped the little woman into the taxi and
lifted the little girl in after her

 there and where do you want to
go to

  as soon as the taxi moved slowly off
jimmy turned to the plump man who was
scowling at him with his heavy lidded eyes
half-shut and his little fair mustache
bristling

  next time said jimmy you try and
bilk a little woman out of a cab take care
that the man who sees you isnt worse
tempered than i am or else maybe mis-
ter youll be hit in one of the soft parts of
your body and youll die quick because
mister youre flabby and youve probably
got valvular disease of the heart or bone
spavin or something just as fatal get me
and if you look at me like that ill slap
you

  the plump man his face a dull red
beckoned to another cab

  just as before the cab drew up at the
curb

  thank you said jimmy he opened
the door driver drive to the nearest
police station

  he jumped into the cab the cab moved
off the driver grinning jimmy leant out
of the window and kissed his hand to the
plump man

  good-by little bright eyes loosen
your collar quick or youll bust and
then he spoke to the driver cut the
police station out george im going
visiting

yes miss mavison was at home
and she was expecting mr kerrill
would he come this way please

  jimmy grinned uneasily as he followed
the butler through the hall and up the
broad white stairs carpeted with red this
mansion was beyond all doubt the home of
wealth and he second mate on an under-
manned badly found tin coffin of a cardiff
tramp was an invited guest and tomor-
row tomorrow he would be at sea

  the butler whose expression was that of
a man to whom life has no secrets paused
and threw open the door with a gesture

  mr kerrill he said in a deep voice

  timmy found himself in a lofty drawing-
room walking across a polished hardwood
floor toward the girl he had met her once
only yet even had he been fated never to
meet her again he could never have for-
gotten her she was a tall girl with fair
hair a shade darker than his own and blue
eyes that looked at one steadily without
flinching and a complexion tanned from an
outdoor life and a smile that would have
set any man much more nervous than
jimmy kerrill at his ease directly he saw
her

  and although she wore a cream shirt with
a soft collar and black silk tie and a skirt
of some fawn tweed and tan silk stockings
and tan shoes nevertheless she gave jimmy
the impression at a glance an impression
that persisted throughout his visit that
never not even in the moving pictures
never before in all his life had he seen any
girl so splendidly and perfectly dressed as
miss mavison

  what was more jimmy decided after
less than five minutes conversation there
was something about this tall girl with the
fair hair-he reminded himself too that
after all she was only a girl-there was
something about her that told him that she
the tramp



was the kind of girl who would never go
back on a pal or reveal a secret or break a
promise or tell a he or expect a man to
make love to her or pay her compliments
or rubbish like that

   she motioned jimmy to sit by her side
on the big couch near one of the tall win-
dows tea would be ready in one minute
she asked him had he had much difficulty
in reaching the house and it was this that
made jimmy tell her with a certain amount
of humor the story of a plump man who
had tried to steal the taxi from the woman
with the two children

   when he had finished the girl looked at
him with a little furrow between her
straight eyebrows and said-

   mr kerrill youre like one of those
knights we used to read of in the story
books going around the country rescuing
damsels in distress and killing dragons and
giants arent you

   lord no said the second mate of the
medea much abashed

   the girl laughed

   you came in the nick of time to save
me anyway the shopkeeper said i was
trying to cheat him that was the awful
part of it of course

   wish id known said jimmy

  what would you have done

  oh i dunno said jimmy made
him apologize talked to ham thats all
the door opened

   mr romer said the stout butler

   a thick-set young man with a round red
face and a beaming smile dressed in
tweeds bustled into the room

  by jove eileen old girl-how are
you

  then he saw jimmy standing by the
girls side and he stopped

   hullo he said in a lame way hullo
he came forward rather more slowly
looking as if all his good nature had de-
parted

   archie said the girl holding out her
hand i thought youd be here half an
hour ago

   she spoke as if she were pleading with
him and jimmy wondered what exactly was
the relationship between them

   couldnt get away from the office he
said

   the girl turned to jimmy

   mr kerrill i want to introduce mr
romer archie this is a great friend of

mine mr kerrill who saved me from an-
other disaster yesterday

  mr romer the big red-faced man
bowed

   jimmy disliked him at sight

  hah so mr kerrill saved you from
disaster eileen did he lucky mr ker-
rill and the disaster what was it

   id lost my precious purse and was hav-
ing rather a bad time with a very rude
shopkeeper when mr kerrill arrived

  mr romer not a very amiable young
man apparently frowned

   ah and mr kerrill i presume called
to enquire how you were after your ordeal
eh whether you were up and about and
taking a little nourishment and so on

   the girls cheeks were flushed

   not exactly archie it was i who asked
mr kerrill to come and see me then she
laughed rather nervously hadnt we bet-
ter all sit down

  she dropped on to the couch and once
more she motioned jimmy to sit by her
side

   mr romer seated himself in a straight-
backed chair scowled at the round brass
tea-tray with the spirit lamp burning under
the kettle and turned to jimmy

   i dont-ah-think ive had the pleasure
of meeting you before mr kerrill have i
no said jimmy guardedly

   live in cardiff

  not exactly said jimmy you see
im abroad most of the time im a sailor
ah mr romers expression became
alert navy

  merchant service second mate and
then he added almost defiantly tramp
steamer

  mr romer shot a quick side glance at
the girl ah indeed and so miss mavi-
son invited you here did she jimmy no-
ticed that he smiled with his lips only and
not with his eyes youre fortunate he
said dryly

  i am said jimmy and not even on
board the medea had he met a ruder and
more objectionable man than this mr
romer most fortunate

  archie said the girl what makes
you say things like that theyre not
clever you know

  i never supposed they were said mr
romer chuckling mr kerrill is fortu-
nate thats all i mean

  but jimmy knew better he knew that


adventure

mr romer was sneering at him because he
was only a miserable sailor a second mate
of a tramp steamer and on that account
fortunate to be permitted to set foot in a
respectable house fortunate to be allowed
to know a girl like eileen mavison fortu-
nate to be able to meet mr romer on
equal terms

  apparently the girl knew better too
for a few moments she said nothing but sat
and looked at mr romer from under her
long lashes as if she were studying him
carefully and trying to decide something of
much importance and at last she opened
her eyes wide and leant forward

  archie she said perhaps mr kerrill
is more fortunate than you are

  to jimmys amazement romer jumped
to his feet his red face almost purple

  it seems to me eileen the sooner i go
the better thank you for a most enter-
taining visit i am not-ah-likely to ac-
cept one of your kind invitations again
in a hurry

  no said eileen mavison filling the
tea-pot with boiling water from the kettle
no archie and perhaps youre not likely
to have the opportunity

  the big young man bowed with exagger-
ated politeness first to the girl and then to
jimmy

  thank you again eileen you anticipate
my wishes as usual perhaps then i am
to consider our engagement at an end mr
kerrill some day i should like to have
the pleasure of meeting you somewhere
else

  jimmy was also on his feet

  i wonder whether you would or not mr
romer he said im not so sure he
felt all of a sudden furiously angry

mr romer walked slowly out of
the room the girl turned to jimmy
with flaming cheeks

  mr kerrill i apologize

  its not you who ought to apologize
miss mavison said jimmy but me
hadnt i better go after him and tell him
im going and you want him back

  no said the girl i wouldnt dream
of it he was abominably rude to you
for no reason ive warned him before
often he thinks he can do what he likes
he cant he didnt mean that about our
engagement being at an end of course
he couldnt have

  then-why im very glad said jimmy
but said the girl though he didnt
mean it perhaps i do she paused and
sat staring at jimmy with her teeth
pressed into her lower lips and her forehead
puckered though why or how i should
ever have let him imagine we were engaged
i cant understand

  it seemed to jimmy that she was merely
speaking her thoughts aloud he grew
more and more uncomfortable

  all at once she flashed a smile at him

  mr kerrill she said do sit down
again please

  and-you dont think im to blame
miss mavison for mr romers going
certainly not she gave him a cup of
tea and now you must tell me about the
sea i never knew that you were a sailor
of course i like sailors always 

  i dont said jimmy

  the girl looked puzzled

  i dont understand

  no said jimmy perhaps you dont
miss mavison you dont know em i do
im one of em

  i always thought the sea did so much for
a man

  jimmy shook his head

  physically perhaps he said morally
no mentally no whatever bad there is in
a man the sea will find it

  what did you mean by mentally  the
girl asked

  only this said jimmy that the seas
a wretched career for a man of any-well
intelligence i dont know whether youd
consider i had intelligence or not miss
mavison but what prospects have i got
with luck by the time im forty or forty-
five ill be in command of some miserable
little tramp steamer liable to be thrown on
the beach at a moments notice or without
if i dont do as im told with the owners
and the board of trade and the mens
unions and a half a dozen other gangs out
to down me theres no chance for a man
to do anything big at sea intelligence
doesnt count nor does industry nor
honesty either

  the girl watched him closely the young
man was original at least and his talk
amused her and touched her for she guessed
that deep down hidden away somewhere
there was a lot of good in him although
where or in what respect it was difficult to
judge on so short an acquaintance
the tramp



  perhaps im ignorant she said after
a time am d she raised her eyebrows
and smiled when the young man gave a
perplexed little nod of assent yes im
ignorant i know little about the sea-very
little

  you dont want to know any more
said jimmy either about the sea or ships
or ship-owners especially ship-owners
but surely said the girl the sea
teaches you something how to control
other men for instance you make your-
self liked and respected you enforce dis-
cipline you-why i should have thought
that going to sea would be the one carecr
above all others where a man would by his
own ability and force of character come
to the front

  jimmy chuckled what a perfect peach
of a girl

 miss mavison do you read much
fiction

  a good deal mr kerrill

  ah he grinned just so

  what do you mean she asked

  ever seen the crew of a tramp steamer
they couldnt be written about anyway
i tell you miss mavison we dont talk too
much about discipline and making ourselves
respected and liked on board a tramp were
lucky if we can get from one port to another
safely and there are more ways of getting
into trouble at sea in half a day than there
are on dry land in a year

  you dont like being a sailor then

  i loathe it

  why be one

  what else is there to be my father
was a soldier-were irish of course and
broke naturally he was a captain in the
south irish fusiliers and he died of wounds
in south africa when i was about four
my mother died a couple of months after-
ward an uncle-a doctor in london-who
didnt want to be bothered with me took
charge of me i dont blame him in the
least though he made life pretty tolerably
unhappy he sent me to sea as an appren-
tice as soon as he could that was the
cheapest way of finding me work i hated
the sea but i stuck to it-had to-and
now-well im second mate on one of those
tramps i was speaking about

  the young man looked so unhappy and
boyish and there was such an earnest
mournful bitter look in his brown face and
his eyes seemed so sad that the girl had a

sudden impulse to lean forward and pat his
hand and tell him he wasnt to worry be-
cause she would think out some plan to
make him happier and to give him hope
but then that was out of the question
she knew impossible and after all this
strange young man had rather too good an
opinion of himself as it was

  if she showed herself too full of sympathy
he might imagine that-well he might
imagine a lot of things nevertheless she
would take him in charge at once she would
help him somehow she would teach him
some very important truths about his own
failings she would make him realize that
other people had their point of view as well
as himself

  in the distance a telephone bell was
ringing

  youll do better than you think mr
kerrill im sure you will

  its the fault of the ship-owners that the

sea isnt a better life-

  the girl interrupted him

  but mr kerrill youre wrong there
i know not all ship-owners are incon-
siderate and mean i assure you

  the butler opened the door

  miss mavison some one wishes to speak
to you on the telephone

  the girl stood up

  mr kerrill will you excuse me just one
minute

  she hurried out of the room

  through the open door there came the
sound of voices

  eileen a man and not the butler
certainly spoke to her from the stairs

  yes father what is it

  what have you been doing to poor
archie i met him just now and he seemed
rather unhappy my dear girl i dont
want to criticize you ot interfere but hadnt
you better exercise discretion sometimes

you know-

  some one wants to speak to me on the
phone she said trot into the drawing-
room and talk to mr kerrill theres a
dear

  jimmy who was standing gazing out of
the window turned as a plump pale-faced
man with a little fair mustache entered the
room

  for a moment they stared at each other
without speaking and then the plump
mans pale face turned red and his sleepy
eyes were no longer sleepy but hard and


adventure

fierce and his soft mouth twisted into a grin
oh ho he said so its you is it

  he closed the door and came slowly to-
ward jimmy who shifted his weight from
one foot to the other and chuckled
nervously

  well he said this is what you call
unexpected eh

  that the plump man who had tried to
steal the taxi from the woman with the two
children should be the father of eileen
mavison struck him as being not comic
but the most tragic thing that had ever
happened

unexpected said the plump man
yes now before i have you thrown out

for your-insolence who are you and

what are you

  my names kerrill im second mate
on a ship called the medea

  youre what said the plump man
shrilly second mate on the medea and
you have the impertinence to come here
the plump man spluttered with indigna-
tion oh so thats it is it you come
here do you know who i am

  mr mavison i suppose miss mavi-
sons father

  my name is not mavison i am miss
mavisons step-father my name is grin-
ton now do you know who i am

  that jimmy had never heard of him
seemed to make the plump man more in-
dignant than ever

  youre a fool he said i know every-
thing about you kerrill that i care to know
youre one of those young men who think
it a proof of intelligence to be insolent ive
had reports on you before now

  a lie but it served jimmy gazed at him
in growing astonishment

  i dont understand he said

  no but you soon will i never in all
my life heard anything like it that you
should actually dare come here to my home
passes my comprehension id as soon
tolerate a deck-hand or a fireman as a second
mate he laughed a weak sniggering kind
of laugh id think little enough of you
kerrill if you were the medeas captain
which you never will be but a second
mate and an inefficient second mate too
good god he snapped his fingers in
jimmys face clear out sharp

maybe youd better tell me who you
are said jimmy slowly it might help

i	dont-have to prove im as good as the

next man but ill say this its no insult to
your step-daughter for me to know her

  the plump man came close to jimmy and
scowled at him

 have you signed on for the next
voyage

  i have

  then its too late to get rid of you now
but its your last voyage on the medea
and mr kerrill if i have anything to do
with it ill get you blacklisted in every port
in the united kingdom ill make things
so hot for you that no ship-owner will let
you set foot on his decks i own the
medea- now get out before i have you
thrown out

  the second mate of the medea walked
slowly down the broad red carpeted stairs
in the distance he could hear the voice of
the plump pale faced mans step-daughter
eileen mavison talking over the telephone

after waiting for a quarter of an
hour captain dorrock was at last
permitted to enter the inner office
mr grinton kept him standing for a further
two minutes while he pretended to be una-
ware of his presence

  then he turned in his swivel chair and
pointed with his pen at another chair some
distance away from his roll-topped desk
thereby making captain dorrock feel in-
ferior and ill-at-ease and nervous which
was precisely the state of mind that mr
grinton desired to create

  wont be long dorrock-busy he
said

  captain dorrock-black john dor-
rock-stared grimly at the wall opposite
with its pale gray paper and the pictures of
steamers and wondered fiercely why grin-
ton should always arouse in him feelings of
hate and contempt no other man in the
world had ever treated him with such off-
hand deliberate rudeness without paying

the price in full yet grinton-him

soft and flabby and sleek did as he pleased

  and why not if grinton chose to exert
his power what could a poor devil of a
shipmaster do but crawl when he was or-
dered crawl and cringe and lick the polished
patent-leather shoes of the man who paid
him his miserable wages and owned him
body and soul

  well dorrock said mr grinton
the tramp



leading back and crossing his short legs
well and what can i have the pleasure of
doing for you this fine morning

he pulled open a drawer and drew out a
box of cigars

smoke dorrock

thank you sir said dorrock he
stood up and took one of the cigars and
then still on his feet he began to speak
mr grinton sir ive come to ask you a
favor i didnt want to i hate doin it but
i have to

mr grinton watched him between half-
closed lids and nursed his knee

i have to said dorrock miserably
mr grinton sir my wifes ill the
doctors dont think none too well of her
chances i want to know sir if you could
see your way to advancin me a little

money-

his brown clean-shaven face reddened
and his gray eyes under the black bushy
eyebrows wavered and he broke off in the
middle of his sentence

mr grinton dropped his feet to the
ground and leaned forward one elbow on
his desk and frowned at the square-
shouldered man standing in front of
him

so old dorrock was after money bor-
rowing so much the worse for old dor-
rock

im afraid said mr grinton almost

purring i am very much afraid captain

dorrock that what you are asking is

impossible

im not askin for a loan sir no

indeed all i want sir is a little on

account dorrock wiped his ups with the

back of his hairy hand and continued

you see sir its this way the doctors

say my wife cant go on livin in this country

an hope to get better its out of the

question they tell me well sir what am

i to do they say send her to algiers or

switzerland or madeira its the ever-

lastin rain an wet an cold thats playin

her up an between you an me sir

unless i can get hold of a little cash sir i

cant manage it an sir maggie thats

mrs dorrock an a better wife no man

ever had sir mrs dorrock sir will have

to stop on in cardiff

he waited then hoping against hope

although hope had well-nigh vanished

that even now a miracle might come to

pass and he would get the money
a

  captain dorrock said mr grinton
slowly you know my rule he paused
other men he reflected might be embar-
rassed but not paul grinton plain speak-
ing was the best in the long run you
know my rule he went on dont you
why come here then and ask what can
never be granted once i began lending
money and it would be lending where

would i end id have every-captain

and mate in my employ dodging up here
asking could i let em have five pounds
ten twenty and what not captain
dorrock i shall have to refuse you im a
kind-hearted man and im sorry to hear of
your trouble but i cant let you have the
money

  black john dorrock swallowed the lump
in his throat nodded and prepared to de-
part

  thank you sir he said im sorry
too im afraid ive taken up quite a lot
of your time good mornin sir

  mr grinton fingered his little mus-
tache

  dont run away yet dorrock as a
matter of fact im glad you came in
there are one or two things id like to talk
to you about he gazed absently out of
the window by his side whens the
medea likely to sail tomorrow isnt it

  yes sir

  ah mr grinton lit his cigar dor-
rock bring your chair up and sit down
its about the medea that i want to talk
to you

  dorrock wondering what was coming
carried his chair nearer the roll-topped desk
and seated himself

  well sir he said presently

  mr grinton who had been smoking with
every appearance of keen enjoyment looked
at him

  oh yes dorrock sorry he threw
over a box of matches youd better
light up i always find smoking a great
help when one is er-discussing business-
serious business-eh and dorrock this
is serious-most serious

  again he paused dorrock stirred rest-
lessly in his chair he knew the symptoms
he knew beyond a doubt that before he left
that office and went walking down the
sunny street toward the docks grinton
would have told him something that he
would willingly not have heard but as it
was-j


adventure

  yes sir he said you were sayin
dorrock said the ship-owner leaning
forward and lowering his voice dorrock
im going to trust you im going to talk
to you now man to man jf i tell you
that things are not entirely satisfactory in
the shipping business im telling you nothing
you havent already learnt for yourself
shippings finished for the time being
the bottoms dropped out of the market
freights are down to nothing cargoes-
lord what chance has a tramp firm like
mine got of picking up cargoes at a profit
i tell you dorrock were going through as
bad a period of depression as i ever re-
member look there he waved his hand
in the direction of the window south and
west how many hundred thousand tons
of shipping are laid up around the bristol
channel ports eh what chance have i
got of keeping the medea and the druid and
the boadicea and the others in commission
eh dorrock do you realize i stand to lose
by sending the medea across the westard
this trip its a fact

  captain dorrock his face a mask folded
his arms one might have thought not
knowing grinton that the man was a
philanthropist that he was in the ship-
ping business for the sake of his crews or
his country or his health anything save
that he had in the past ten years made a
fortune by cutting wages and running his
ships on the cheap

  no dorrock i tell you candidly if it
hadnt been for the men i have working for
me id have cut my losses and put my
ships on the scrap but i couldnt ive
kept on hoping the tide would turn and
apparently the tide has no intention of
turning dorrock listen to me again
he leant forward again he lowered his
voice again he half-closed his little sleepy
eyes dorrock im up against it at
last everything freights cargoes wages
im at my wits ends for cash

  dorrocks throat had all at once gone dry
and rasping

  yes sir he said slowly yes sir
you asked me for money said the
ship-owner dorrock i am disposed to
give it to you more than you would have
asked for more than you would have
dreamt of getting but- he smiled-
but at a price dorrock at a price i lend
no man money on his own terms i am
prepared to give on my own

so this was it then grinton
whose wealth was proven by his
appearance his clothes his motors
his horses his yacht and his home grinton
who sucked the life-blood from the poor
wretches who manned his ships grinton
was planning on the pretense of poverty
new methods of making money

  well sir said dorrock what do
you suggest

  mr grinton purred

  i think dorrock he said we can
come to an arrangement whereby we may
both profit but- here he tilted his
chair back once more and put the tips of his
fingers together-are you prepared to wait
for that profit say till the end of the
voyage

  if i have to i have to said dorrock
but what do you want me to do sir
mr grinton got up out of his chair and
went to the door and turned the key in the
lock

  dorrock he said when he was once
more seated i need scarcely say that i am
paying you as great a compliment as it is
possible for one man to pay another i
am er-trusting you

  not for the first time sir

  no dorrock it is not the first time that
i have told you things that i should prefer
not to have mentioned in a court of law
or the press for instance nor dorrock
will this be the first time that i have induced
you to help me in ways that i need not er-
specify

  you mean sir said dorrock bluntly
that youre going to get me to do what
you want because you know so much about
me i cant refuse is that it

  mr grinton chuckled

  i shouldnt have put things as plainly
as that myself dorrock but thats more or
less it i want you to do something for
me and i intend paying you well are
you on

  you havent said yet what it is you
want me to do

 i want you to make some money
thats all i want money and you want
money by the plan i am er-going to sug-
gest we can both er-achieve our desired
ends then well both of us be satis-
fied eh

  long-winded and pompous and scared
quickly accurately black john dorrock
summed up his master
the tramp



  youre a long time coming to the
point sir he said

  the medea is getting on in years isnt
she

  she is sir shes old

  shes due for her next survey after this
coming voyage

  she is sir

  will she pass said the owner

  shell need a lot in the way of repairs
an refit said dorrock i think sir i

told you last week that-

  mr grinton cut him short

  i know all about that dorrock you
and the chief engineer just about scared me
out of the business according to you
the medea needs a new hull new engines and
new boilers and lord knows what else
theres the rudder too sir said
dorrock i was having a look at it the
other day its all right of course sir but
the surveyor will kick when he sees that
post

  it strikes me dorrock the surveyor is
going to kick at a lot of things a lot more
things than im inclined to consider in
fact dorrock speaking frankly i cant
afford it no owner who wasnt a born
fool would if i want the medea reclassed
a hundred a one at lloyds it  cost me
more than the ships worth no its off
the map dorrock-off the map

  whats it mean then the scrap heap
but he knew he knew from grintons
voice and his smile and the droop of his
eyelid and his methods in the past that
never would the medea go to the scrap
while there was money to be made out
of her

  the medea is insured for a considerable
sum dorrock as you know a greater
sum owing to the fall in the value of ships
than she is er-worth i believe without
consulting my books i believe i am right
in saying that the total-amounts to some-
thing around ninety-five thousand pounds
dorrock sucked in his breath sharply
ninety-five thousand-lord

  or a hundred and five thousand i forget
the precise figures at the moment but
would i get even the ninety-five thousand
if the ship were to be sold

  no sir youd get maybe ten thousand
maybe nine thousand five hundred

  or maybe nothing exactly dorrock
you understand the position i know i
want money how am i to get it

  dorrock knew that mr grinton was
watching him closely waiting for the sug-
gestion to come from him the solution of
the problem that would prove that he had
grasped the significance of mr grintons
figures

  the medeas worth more sunk than
afloat said dorrock thats easy

  so she is said the medeas owner
so she is

black john dorrock wiped the sweat
from his face with a red handkerchief
and you want money he said slowly
and you too dorrock you want it
just as badlv dont you how are we to
get it eh

  look here said dorrock whats
the sense o playin the fool you an me
you want me to scuttle the medea why
not say so an have done with it

  a look of what might have been pain
crossed mr grintons plump face

  my dear captain dorrock scuttle the
medea could you

  i could said dorrock an you know
it but suppose i dont suppose i said

youd asked me to-

  ah said mr grinton then-then
dorrock things would happen i think
youd be very sorry-im sure of it
youre threatenin me mr grinton
not at all dorrock you have er-
suggested a method by which you can earn
some money

  his rather full lips curled in a sneer
dorrock leant forward and brought his
fist down with a crash on the desk in front
of him

  its a-hold up thats what it is

just as much as if youd got a gun in your
hand you get me in here an you hint at
things an you wait till i tell you back what
youve got in your mind an then you pre-
tend its me suggested it i do the dirty

work an you sit there at your ease-

  mr grinton rose to his feet and un-
locked the door

  all right he said youd better go
youve dug your own grave

  dug his own grave-he had of course-
and maggies as well dorrock saw him-
self in a flash for what he was-grintons
slave

  mr grinton dorrock was standing
also mr grinton sir im sorry but
im worried about my wife i take it
back everything


adventure

  ah said mr grinton ah thats
better dorrock much better he locked
the door again and came back to the swivel
chair sit down dorrock an well talk
it over youll do as you er-suggest
then eh

  yes said black john dorrock slowly
yes mr grinton ill do it but couldnt
you see your way sir to letting me have
something in advance

  he could if he would of course a few
pounds was all that they would need

  dorrock listen to me mr grintons
usually pale face was pink ive told you
before that i cant i mean it im sorry
but i never permit my personal feelings to
interfere with business and if youre
laboring under the impression that men are
scarce and that id have a difficulty in
getting any one else to take command of the
medea let me tell you that out of work ship-
masters are as common as coal dust all
i have to do is to open the window here and
whistle and theyd come at a trot with their
tongues out no dorrock i think for
your own sake that you would be well-
advised to help me in the er-scheme you
suggested

  dorrock squirmed and then uttered a
harsh laugh

  ill do what you want me to he said
slowly ill sink the medea whenever
you like and wherever you like and the
price

  ah said the owner the price eh
  and then they began to bargain

ill

an so its settled

yes mac its settled

black john dorrock nodded and lit
his pipe and watched the lean humorous
face of macgish the chief engineer of the
medea seated on the other side of the
little table in the parlor

  aye macgish pondered aye john
he has ye the auld fox has ye yell do
as he ses an ill help ye fur your sake
an ma ain sake an the sake o the prrofits
accruin

  he grinned

  but maist especially fur the sake o the
prrofits an what i can buy wi them
man if i hadna a perpetual thirst on me
what a wunnerfu contentit an happy
jtnan i wud be wi a hoose in aberdeen an

a garrden an an auld dog fur company
an the kirk on the sabbath an-losh
neer a thocht of a bilge pump or a thrust or
a crank-shaft to weary me an keep me
awake nichts worryin

  black john chuckled at the picture
youd be dead in six months without
your engines mac an you know it

  aye i wud that macgish sighed
and drank what remained of the beer in his
glass aye id be deid in sax months
for a time neither of the two men spoke
the little room with its red wall-paper
and red-shaded gaslight and the drawn
curtains and the pictures and models of
ships and the shells and curios gathered
together from the seven seas was warm
and snug a kettle sang on the fire that
burnt with yellow flames in the open grate
on the mantelpiece between the little
chinese image and a burmese buddha a
clock ticked out soothingly the passage of
time a gray parrot in a cage near the book-
case crooned softly to itself the rain pat-
tered against the window

  presently macgish sighed

  ye hae a fine wee hame john yere
lucky but i dare say if what were plannin
the nicht gangs aff wi oot accident or
mebbe i shud say if the accident passes
wioot ony unforeseen circumstance then
maist like the wife wull be wantin to
move

  yes said dorrock shell move yes
mac shell move

  he wondered which it would be algiers
madeira switzerland italy-italy now
was cheaper perhaps than any one could
live cheaply in italy-near naples for
instance or over on the adriatic side-

certainly not naples itself-

  but macgish was speaking to him
  whats that you say mac

  did he gie ye ony idee whaur he wud
like the accident to occur

  homeward bound why lord knows
hes deep old grinton deep as the at-
lantic an just as vicious an hard to
cross mac do you know what he
leant forward across the table mac id
like to have his soft neck between my two
hands this minute id like to squeeze until
he screamed for pity an go on squeezin
until he couldnt scream no more an then
id laugh at him laugh mac until all of a
sudden hed go limp all over an id know
id done one good deed in the world before
the tramp



my time came to swing at the end of a rope
john yeve an imagination that does ye
credit

  but i wont mac  i wont ill bow
an scrape an duck my head when we meet
an smile on him like an old sheep dog
an jump whence ses so an do what he
wants without argument an why mac
why eh because im scared of the
beach im scared bone deep of bein
thrown on the scrap heap an starvin
thats the sea mac here yere not
drinkin

  he jumped up from his chair and took
another bottle of beer from the sideboard

  some one knocked at the front door and
he swore under his breath

  if thats a message from the ship sayin
im wanted ill- pon my word mac
ill brain em

  he put the bottle down on the table
  ill go an see who it is

  the sound of footsteps in the passage
outside stopped him he waited frown-
ing straining his ears to try to hear what
the voices were saying

  mrs dorrock a pretty little woman her
face white save for the pink flush in her
thin cheeks her dark eyes filled with
anxiety entered the room and closed the
door gently after her

  jack she whispered its mr lap-
pett the mate

  the devil said dorrock maggie
whats he want did he tell you

  he says its business but i dont be-
lieve it she caught hold of her husbands
arm jack go slow i dont trust him
hes trying to knife you dont talk
whatever you do

  she broke into a spasm of coughing that
silenced her

  dorrock patted her shoulder

  maggie old girl youre not to have
fancies

  he strode across the room to the door
come on in lappett glad to see you
as mrs dorrock went out the mate
entered

   ullo captain dorrock he grinned
 ullo convivial meeting eh chief i
didnt expect to find you ere ow
goes it

  and although he smiled and showed his
pleasure at meeting two such friends of his
as the captain and the chief engineer his
heartiness grated there was in his manner

and his flat loud voice a curious lack of
sincerity that made it an effort to smile
back at him and answer in the way he in-
tended he should be answered

  take yer coat off lappett an sit ye
down said black john what brings
you here this far off your track eh

  and was there a shade of uneasiness in
lappetts little pale eyes or was there not
did his grin relax a trifle over his protruding
teeth yellow from tobacco and did the
lines between the small hooked nose and
the tight mouth take on the shape of a
sneer or was it merely the flickering of the
gas on the thin sallow face

  the flickering gas perhaps 

  the mate broke into a deep and jovial
laugh

  matter o fact captain i came out to
see you on purpose he groped in the
pocket of his topcoat and brought out a
bottle wrapped in pink paper been
makin a bit o money last two days
horses been runnin true to form eres
something to chase away-whats it they
say-dull care an gloom

  makin a bit o money eh said black
john stripping the paper from the bottle
think o that now these hard times
brandy eh well lappett thats good
of you draw that chair up to the fire
youre in need of a drop yourself i bet
cold out aint it

  and all the time he was bustling about
the little front room chatting and getting
fresh glasses out of the sideboard and put-
ting fresh coal on the fire and drawing the
cork of the brandy bottle black john
dorrock was wondering what reason the
mate would give to explain his coming
all right on board eh he asked
right as rain said the mate thought
id have a run ashore for an hour or so to
stretch my legs the seconds on board

said hed had the-uva day-three full-

sized riots since four oclock e wouldnt
say where or what just laughed when i
asked him i dunno think es got himself
mixed up with some girl

  if he has said black john hes been
keepin it almighty dark always set
him down as a sort o woman-hater

ah said the mate hes deep deep
as they make em those quiet ones are
you go along never suspectin an all
at once you see its got into the papers
he winked at the chief


adventure

not that young kerrilps quiet said
black john most of the time hes a

- sight too noisy for my likin too

much side an bounce ever hear him
talk youd think hed condescend like to

honor us with his -presence instead

o feelin-lucky hes got a job

  young kerrill he kind o works on yer
nerves said lappett parsons son
they say an chock full o piety an the
ten commandments wont do this an e
wont do that talk to a girl no not that
kind of a girl an so on in public
anyow what he does when nobodys
lookin thats is secret asked him once
last voyage why he went to sea at all an he
had the cheek to say the crossin sweepers
union an the garbage gatherers associa-
tion was full up

  the chief chuckled

  hae ye seen him ficht hes got the
kick of a mule in each fist

 huh black john grunted what
hes sufferin from is swelled head hes
got it bad mebbe well do somethin to
ease it water mac

  man wud ye ruin guid liquor not a
drap

  the three men sat in front of the fire and
sipped their drinks and talked of the sea of
ships they had known of men they had
had as shipmates of ship-owners and their
ways

  and then the mate leant forward and
knocked the dottle from his pipe into the
fire

  they tell me grintons took to throwin
his money around a bit

  not on us said black john he held
out his hands to the blaze he aint hard
up exactly i bet

not him it ud take a lot of spendin
to get through what hes put away safe an
sound for a rainy day but i heard it said
hes thinkin o gettin married again
wha tellt ye that asked the chief
lady friend of mine said the mate
with a wink the old fox didnt you
may bank on that i wondered what hed
ave said if id asked him if it was true
seen him lately asked dorrock trying
not to show that he was interested at
last

  this afternoon said the mate he
came aboard an ad quite a yarn with me
oh said black john was that
after id gone

  yes he asked where you was i said
youd been called ashore on business

  black john nodded

  presently the mate went on

  the superintendent was with him
old traskett lookin like he hadnt had a
square meal in his life what dyou
think lappetts grin was triumphant
they asked me both of em grinton first
though whether id like a ship of my own
hows that eh grinton said id been
givin great satisfaction an he was very
pleased with me

  black john dorrock was startled he
glanced at macgish over the mates head
as he rubbed his knees

  i wunner noo said macgish is he
thinkin o buildin or buyin anither auld
tramp to add to his fleet eh

  or said black john with a little
laugh or as it that some ones goin to get
fired out me for instance did he give
you a line on that lappett eh

  i wouldnt take no one elses job cap-
tain dorrock thats not my way of doing
things an you know it

  a feller cant pick nor choose these days
if they offer you a job my job any ones
you grab it an dont argue

  but grab it of course hed grab it
lappett of all men talking big about not

taking another mans job -

  black john frowned at the fire

  no said lappett thats not my way
i believe in us captains an mates hangin
together we got to stand firm against
ship-owners else where would we be
no captain you may depend on me
fortescue lappett im proud to serve
under you yes sir proud though i
went to sea five years before you did i
aint the man to let a thing like that stand
in the way no sir that dont weigh
with me at all

  dorrock finished his drink and nodded
two or three times gravely as if considering
and approving what the mate had said
but he knew what the mate meant he was
ugly either he hid a threat under a pre-
tense of friendliness or else the drink he
had taken was making him say more than he
had intended

  a-weel said the chief engineer we
live an learn

  we do said lappett with a chuckle
thats a fact chief ere youre not
drinkin he jumped to his feet and
the tramp



filled the three glasses lor an ere we
are the three of us-all poor ard-workin
honest seafarers-poors the right word
captain aint it but i take it you an
me the three of us we aint above turnin
an honest penny if the chance come our
way eh we got to elp ourselves thats
my motter an if we dont-if we dont
gents-then the more fools us no one else
wont our wages dont carry us far do

they wages- that old fish in the

office now he knows a thing or two dont
he hes out to feather is own nest eh
not ours aint that so

  the little pale eyes glanced from the
captain to the chief engineer and back
again as though trying to read their
thoughts

  an if hes out for money whats wrong
with us bein out for money too

  jus so said dorrock jus so

he wished now that he had

kept his mind clear but the-

brandy was getting him what
was the meaning at the back of the mates
words the owner was out to make
money so why shouldnt they make money
as well had he suspected the little
yellow-faced toad or was he guessing

  why had he come to the house to-night
had he heard whispers already did he
suspect was it another hold-up another
edging in for a share of the proceeds-or
what

  better say nothing and wait

  the mate continued in a voice that was
little more than a low whisper

  now listen im tired o workin for
old grinton for starvation wages see
dog tired an im out for a pound or two
on the side thats me saviy any-
thing that comes up im ready to jump at
an unless im way off the map gents im
inclined to believe you two both of you
are thinkin the same

  what the-are ye bletherin aboot

said the chief testily whats got ye
why dinna ye speak oot instead o hintin
at things no yin can foller

  i will then said the mate i will
mister yesterday a feller i know-
limehouse larry they call him-came to
me with a proposition that looks pretty
good

  limehoose larry said macgish

up a cargo for ome aint that it

  who told you said black john

  ah ha said the mate there aint
much that this child dont know no sir
and again there was the flicker of the
eyelid and the leer that made dorrock won-
der uneasily how much the mate knew and
how much he had guessed

  ive known men knew too much mister
for the good of their health he said

  no offense captain-no offense but
this proposition now-theres an old partner
of limehouse larrys thats got himself in
bad all the way round i didnt ask how
an thats neither ere nor there but hes
layin up at his brothers ouse in alifax
with his right arm and his thigh broke an
lord knows how much else of him he
cant move even if he wants to an hes
got hidden away stuff worth thousands of
pounds brought across from the continent
an all useless because e aint able to dispose
of it whats worse from is point of view
the police are after im theyve been
warned see even when he gets well
hell have to be slippy an get away to a
place where e aint known an whats
he to do with the stuff eh ah thats
whats troublin him

  the mate paused and looked knowing
  black john growled

  get on with it mr lappett he said
get on

  now soon as we get to alifax then we
go an see this feller an have a talk with
him you understand eh limehouse
larry dont see the use o lettin stuff like

on well then well take the stuff off
this bloke with the broken thigh an fetch
it aboard in a suit-case fair an square
without a word bein said to us

  oh black john nodded then its
smugglin eh

  lappett closed his eyes and smiled

ah youre right smugglin it is
seems a roundabout kind of job to go
smugglin goods from europe to halifax
an back to cardiff whats the sense
of it

  ah but listen that stuff was meant


adventure

for new york or boston the feller were
talkin of could have run it across the line
from new brunswick into state o maine
see but ow can he new yorks im-
possible an now eres limehouse clam-
orin for the stuff across this side well
manage it for him ive told him so
lord if we aint clever enough to hide it
aboard the medea where not even the foxiest
customs man could smell it out my name
aint lappett see lord why how many
time have each of us ere brought stuff
ome an run it through the dock gates
without bein spotted eh he broke
into a high pitched laugh its easy
black johns eyes narrowed under the
bushy black brows

  very nice he said very an i
dare say mister wed make big profits-
if limehouse larry didnt put it across us
but tell us whats this stuff they want us to
take charge of

  snow said the mate

  s n o w repeated dorrock you

mean-

  coke what else lord theres money
there captain lord why we couldnt
lose if we tried

	i wouldnt touch it said black john
slowly not with a barge-pole no mis-
ter whats more you wont touch it
either mister not on my ship i draw the
line somewhere

  why blast yer said the mate do
you mean to pretend youve turned pious all
of a sudden or what do you mean to say
you aint willin to break a law or two an
earn a bit o money by cheatin the cus-
toms - i dont believe it -

how long have you an me been ship-
mates eh

  mr lappett are you trying to insinuate
that my husband would do anything dis-
honest

  the three men started mrs dorrock
stood at the door of the room her face
white her dark eyes fierce and angry her
lips set in a hard line

  maggie said the husband now
maggie-you shouldnt be here

  i want to know if mr lappett thinks
youd act like a crook

  well i wouldnt i told him so hadnt
you better go

   the little woman continued to stare at the
mate

  mr lappett do you mean to say-do

you mean to hint that my husbands dis-
honest hes not dishonest hes never
done anything mean in his life

  lappett burst into a shriek of laughter
ho ho ho lord mrs dorrock-
elp some one old me mrs dorrock-
never done nothin mean in his life he
rose to his feet and stood resting his back
against the mantelpiece ho ho ho

why- mrs dorrock

  ilis laughter died away his thin face
with the yellow skin that always looked too
tight for the skull underneath was livid
with passion he showed his great fangs
in a snarl

  ive never met a shipmaster yet as
wasnt ready to pick up a piece of money an
no questions asked see your husbands
the same as any i know things that
mebbe would surprise yer

  black john dorrock realized rather
muzzily that the mate was saying things
that were hurting maggie things that
though possibly true he should never have
said

   all at once he lost his temper

  get out o here -you lappett-

get out at once or mebbe ill show you
he reached out his hand and grabbed
lappett by the collar and shook him
you miserable little dock rat shut

up what the-do you mean by your

lies eh

  ow the mate yelped ow youre
hurtin me-youre chokin me stop it
for the love of gord

  mrs dorrock laid her hand on her hus-
bands arm

  jack please

  dorrock released his grip on the mates
neck

   another time mister ill kill you

  the mate glared at him and then he
rubbed his throat and mumbled something
about people who couldnt take a joke
without flaring into a temper and he was
sorry if hed said anything that captain
dorrock had misunderstood

  if you didnt mean it said dorrock
what did you say it for

  for fun-thats all-no harm intended
why captain surely you dont think-
mrs dorrock you dont think id say
anything against your husband why
there aint a more honest man livin no
one could be more honest an when he
grabbed me just now i was so taken aback
the tramp



i could ardly tell im to stop or ed hurt
me captain youre as strong as a horse
aye said dorrock with a grin
aye im strong all right

  mair strang than ye hae ony idee
said the chief yed be surprized

  well said lappett i think ill be
goin back to the ship its gettin late
yes said mrs dorrock yes its
late isnt it it was good of you to come
when the mate had gone and dorrock
had returned to the little parlor after shut-
ting the front door she stood for a while by
the table without speaking

  well said dorrock well maggie
what is it

  now do you understand
understand what said dorrock un-
comfortably

  understand what that mate of yours is
dont you see through him jack hes
trying to ruin you you an mac here
you make me tired-the pair of you
youve been drinking too much of course
he brought you this didnt he

  she held in her hand the empty brandy
bottle

  that on top of the beer oh johnny
johnny why havent you learnt wisdom
black john put his hands on his wifes
shoulders

  maggie he said youre an angel
lappetts tough but hes well meanin
she smiled into his face

  i cant be angry with you jack on your
last night but steer clear of lappett
hes bad

   dorrock kissed the pale lips

   maggie dear lass youre too good for me
and lappett hurrying through mean
and narrow streets toward the docks won-
dered how he could get even with his cap-
tain black john dorrock had nearly
choked him black john dorrock should
pay for that with interest he whistled
softly to himself deep in thought dorrock
and macgish were planning something he
was positive something crooked they
would be clever if they kept their secret

iv

sandy racken the second
engineer of the medea clad in a
greasy boiler suit his face shining
with sweat and oil an old uniform cap
perched on the back of his head came out

of the alleyway that led to the engine-room
and stood on the bridge deck looking
around in search of some one not too busy
for conversation

  the second mate approached from the
poop

  sandy grinned

  hullo jimmy what have you been

doin eh

  seein the steerin-gears all clear
whats the matter sandy slept it off
slept what off said sandy indigently
lord said jimmy the habits and
morals of you engineers well well
havent i warned you sandy time and
again where does it hurt most

  again sandy grinned

  they stood side by side leaning against
the bulwarks

  jimmy look yonder

  jimmys gaze followed the direction of
the second engineers thumb

   golly he said

  on the lower bridge black john dorrock
was talking to the amiable mr grinton
whose head he had threatened to punch the
previous day

  you see em said racken the
crookedest pair of thieves between here an
frisco an thats goin some look at old
grintons side view jimmy he takes more
care of his belly than he does of ours
dont he

  sandy your coarseness pains me mr
grinton is one of my oldest friends

  huh the second engineer grunted
tell me another you said only tother
day youd never seen the old shark

  my lad said jimmy since then uncle
grinton and i have become bosom pals
whenever he sees me now he says jim
what about a tenner to put in your pocket
to spend or my dear old james come
on up to the house and stay a month that
kind of thing

  why dont you shout it a bit louder

said the second engineer youd look-

funny if he or black john heard you
wouldnt you

  and then sandy rackens sallow cheeks
went red under the grease and he clutched
at jimmys arm

  holy sufferin snakes look jimmy
am i dreamin or what

  jimmy turned toward the quayside and
the huge coal tip towering above the
medea


 adventure

t

  whats up he asked

  then he saw eileen mavison in a blue
suit and a small blue hat step from the
gangway on to the rusty iron deck-plates
she hesitated a moment and stood glancing
about her with a little puzzled expression
in her face as if not quite certain what her
next move would be

  a sudden panic took possession of jimmy
kerrill

  sandy he whispered im off

  what on earth for said the second
engineer jimmy thats miss mavison
old grintons step-daughter my lord
jimmy aint that girl a peach

  there followed what was for the second
engineer of the medea one of the most stir-
ring episodes of a stirring life for eileen
mavison the owners step-daughter had
caught sight of jimmy and was coming to-
ward him smiling and holding out her
gloved hand

  mr kerrill she said

  never before had jimmy felt so miserable
eileen mavison had learnt that he the man
who had insulted her step-father was the
second mate of one of her step-fathers
ships

  the second engineer vanished into the
fiddley

  jimmy and the girl shook hands

  mr kerrill she said yesterday you
bolted before i had time to explain things
i must apologize

  her blue eyes were so jimmy decided
rather gloomily the color of corn flowers
her hair was like golden wheat in the sun-
shine

  i understand that you and father dis-
covered that you had met before

  jimmy could only stare at her in a kind
of stupor

  you neednt have been so shy mr ker-
rill simply because you found that my step-
father was your owner but you ran away
and i wasnt able to pay off my debt thats
why im here this morning

  she paused and the color came into her
cheeks and she went on again rather more
quickly

  fathers a bit hasty but you mustnt
mind that mr kerrill his barks worse
than his bite always

  jimmy found his voice

  im afraid i didnt make a very good
impression going off like that but-i was
rather taken aback miss mavison-and i

didnt know youd care for me to stay any

 longer you being the owners daughter-

   rubbish said the girl isnt that a
 little hard on me what have i done to
 deserve so poor an opinion and my step-
 father also any friend of mine is a friend
 of his only of course mr kerrill fathers
 in business and a man may seem to be hard
 in his business dealings when hes really
 kind-hearted and not even in business
 would my step-father stoop to do things
 that other business men seem to do as a
 matter of course

   the girls cheeks were still flushed but
 into her blue eyes there had come a curious
 gleam of amusement that made jimmy won-
 der what she was going to say next

   you do understand dont you she
 said and now theres something else
 she smiled at him with her head slightly
 tilted to one side

   do you remember me she said its
 rather trying for me to have to ask you
 that but do you

   remember you said jimmy uncer-
 tainly but-why of course miss mavi-
 son id scarcely be likely to forget
 you-not since yesterday and the day
 before

   but you have forgotten me and id
 forgotten you mr kerrill until you told
 me you were the son of a soldier and that
 gave me a clue i knew you were irish
 of course

   jimmy felt that he was out of his depth
 once more

   you mean to say miss mavison that
 you knew me before yesterday

   i do i did know you and you knew
 me very intimately in fact mr kerrill
 i wonder you can look me in the face and
 not blush to think how youve neglected
 me-after all your promises the blue
 eyes twinkled and she laughed i was
 rather a forward young person in those
 days-but do you remember those summers
 years ago in donegal

 but-good lord said jimmy youre
 not eileen-little eileen-eileen mavison
 yes said the girl and youre jimmy
 kerrill grown up but youve not changed
 in the very least

- you have said jimmy pointedly

    the girl laughed again and looked quickly
 toward the bridge where her step-father was
 still talking to black john

   do you remember the last time we met
the tramp



when we said good-by to each other on the
cliff near the tall pines

  i do said jimmy i told you all the
wonderful things i was going to do and
what a wonderful man i would be-and
now his face clouded and now here
i am second mate on a tramp steamer

  he pulled himself up in time after all
eileen mavisons step-father owned the
medea and apparently eileen considered
her step-father perfect and so-

  and the girl watching his gloomy face
pitied him and yet a strange little irritation
stirred within her jimmy kerrill though
older than herself was she considered
young and foolish

  mr kerrill she said i should hate
you to feel that because youre only a second
mate on a tramp steamer theres nothing
in life left for you maybe you think youve
ability enough to be something better you
have im sure of it but how do you know
you wont have just as big an opportunity
to make good at sea as on shore if the
chance comes youll make the most of it
i know youll do more youll make the
chance and youll come out on top

  jimmy wondering if in her heart she was
laughing at him muttered that it was very
kind of her to say so

  no said eileen its not very kind
its what i know to be true i believe in
you i want you to believe in yourself
she glanced over her shoulder and turned
once more to jimmy mr kerrill youll
write to me wont you and let me know
how youre getting on-will you id like
to hear from you very much

  eileen what are you doing here

  a querulous voice interrupted her
  hullo father

  mr grinton stood by the girls side
scowling

  eileen i dont like you coming down to
the docks from his manner jimmy ker-
rill might have had no existence mr
jones he said beckoning to a young man
in glasses will you see miss mavison
home please

  he neednt take the trouble said the
girl unless hed like me to give him a lift
ive got the car waiting she held out her
hand to jimmy good-bye mr kerrill
now mind what i say youve got to make

good-

  and with this breaking off abruptly she
departed walking with long boyish strides

toward the gangway leaving jimmy staring
after her with a confused idea in his mincl
that she believed in him and had been trying
to help him and that since she had once
more forgotten to pay him the money she
owed there was a hope that they might meet
again

  mr grinton had turned and was walking
in the direction of the lower bridge

  the mate met him

  good mornin sir he saluted with
deference

  hah lappett hare you the owner
nodded curtly and passed without stopping

  the mate came to where jimmy was still
standing gazing after the girl as she walked
quickly along the side of the basin followed
by the little clerk who was trying to catch
up with her

  hullo jim boy whats the matter eh
the mate eyed him keenly lookin
pretty sour eh whats up

  nothin said jimmy leaving his prob-
lems to take care of themselves nothin
mr lappett why

  whatve you been doin to the owner
eh met him just now an he wouldnt
ardly speak to me you an im been
chewin the rag about anything eh or
what

  the mate chuckled and thrust his thumb
into jimmys ribs

  saw you talkin to that little filly o his
know a thing or two you do but dont
you look too igh me lad or youll come a
cropper i was trottin up hard as i could
to say how-do an cut you out when the
boss interfered an she took to her eels
eileens the goods all right aint she
leave her to me jimmy-leave her to me

  and the mate who had a high opinion
of his own personal charms and in his own
words a way with the women shook his
large head and closed one eye and laughed

  jimmy gave a shrug of his shoulders and
turned away that he should have to be
shipmates with a man like lappett was bad
enough but that he should listen to his
talk about eileen or any other straight
girl was impossible lappett had a habit
when in form of allowing his imagination
to descend to depths deeper than mid-
atlantic and so jimmy slouched off to-
ward the poop again only to be held up by
the long arm of the second engineer

  jimmy said sandy racken in a hoarse
whisper if i wasnt a friend of yours id


adventure

drop you over the side with your skull
cracked do you know jimmy ive been
schemin for the last two years how i can
get to know that girl do you think id
stay on an old broken-down coffin ship like
this if it hadnt been that she was old
bladder-bellys daughter tell me the
truth jimmy how longve you known her
since yesterday-no the day before
the second engineer grunted

  and she comes on board to say good-by
to you how do you do it eh whats the
secret

 jimmy laughed cheer up sandy

were only friends and ive had a-uva

row with her father hes going to fire me
after this voyage

  there came a fierce roar from the engine-
room gratings

  misterr racken are ye gaun the vyage
wi the ship or no if ye are mebbe yell
gie me the honor o yer prresence doon in

the engine-room what the-s keepin

ye

  hark to him

  the second engineer grinned and made

off

in the captains sitting-room on
the lower bridge mr grinton had
without showing the slightest sign
of either annoyance or anger completed his
final instructions for the voyage

  thats about all dorrock you know
what youve got to do i know that my
trust in you will not be er-misplaced
dorrock nodded and said nothing

  and now about the second mate
  eh said dorrock mr kerrill
  yes hes no good

  black john who had seen the second
mate talking to grintons daughter con-
sidered

  ive no fault to find with him sir he
said not as seconds go young of course
an a bit apt to talk for the sake of talkin
but he knows his job sir

  pah mr grinton thumped on the
table so do a thousand others listen
to me dorrock i dont trust him get rid
of him

  but thats impossible sir hes signed
on

  yes yes i know that but as soon as
you can i dont want him aboard any of
my ships ill tell captain traskett i
dont like him watch him keep your

eyes skinned - it man surely you

 can find some way of tripping him

  youre not suggestin sir said black
 john slowly that i should frame somethin
 up are you

  he was getting angry

  grinton held up his hand

  now captain thats enough dont get
 excited ive got reasons that irishman

kerrill or ferrill or whatever his -

 name is is dangerous hes inclined to be
 too inquisitive if you get a chance to
 leave him behind in halifax do so i dont
 say get him into trouble dorrock of
 course

  he shook his head as if this were the
very last thing in the world he desired

  but the sooner you manage to get some
one else in his place the better itll be
worth your while a nods as good as a
wink eh to a blind horse or a ship-
master

  he forced himself to laugh with a pretence
 of heartiness

  have a cigar dorrock let me see

  he glanced at his watch

  well ive got to be going pilots about
 due aboard eh

  dorrock opened the door

  the noise of the main exhaust blowing
off steam was like an echo or a symbol of
his own impatience to be clear of cardiff

  pilots here now sir talkin to the
mate

  hah good feller that mate ill see
what i can do for him

  dorrock nodded

  and the second mate dorrock watch
him--or else well be sorry perhaps both
of us you wouldnt like that little plan of
ours to fall through would you

  dorrock wondered whether it had been
worth his while to deliver himself into grin-
tons power and then he remembered mag-
gie and her cough and the fogs and rain of
cardiff and he sighed and his brief thought
of rebellion faded and he was once more the
same subservient affable obedient slave as
he had been ever since grinton had found
him as he had found most of his captains
half-starved and ready to take anything
that was offered

  no he said i certainly wouldnt like
 it to fall through sir

  and remember dorrock help me on
with my coat theres a good feller remem-
ber as soon as i hear that youve managed
the tramp



things ok then-or as soon dorrock-
black john noticed the hesitation and the
quick shuffling-as soon as the under-
writers come through with the goods then
ill do as i said pay you the money youll
be beyond reach of want for-ah for some
time at least eh

   yes sir thank you sir

  and one punch dorrock hugged the
thought of that one punch to himself one
punch in that little round stomach one
punch and how much would all his wealth
his houses and horses and motor cars be
worth to him nothing-less than nothing
the man was no good flabby soft
black john smiled and followed the owner
down the ladder and on to the bridge-deck
and said good-by at the gangway

  pleasant voyage captain and a safe
return

  thank you sir thank you

  the owner walked down the gang-plank
with the air of a man deserving of the
highest respect of his fellow citizens

  dorrock spat to relieve his pent-up feel-
ings then he turned and nodded to the
pilot

   all ready capn said the pilot stamp-
ing his feet on the deck brrh its
cold

  all ready mister said dorrock an
glad of it the sooner were away out o
here the better he raised his voice mr
lappett stand by to cast off

  the mate who had been talking to the
chief engineer by the door of the fiddley
hurried toward him

  four of the deck-ands aint aboard
yet sir

  blast em where the - are they

then

  macgish approached rubbing his hands
on a piece of waste

  whaur wud they be but quenchin their
thirrsts im yin fireman short noo an a
trimmer thats a but fur maist o the
mom ive had the donkeyman an the
third engineer in the stokehold gettin steam
up an tellin their creator a aboot the
richts an the wrangs o the case

   well capn said the pilot theres no
use in worryin

  whos worryin dorrock snapped
im not well pick the gang up at the
lock o course or some o them but im
in no ruddy hurry to take this packet across
the westard light ship an short-handed

he growled at the mate mister step
lively theres the bosn an carpenter
aboard anyhow have you told off a man
for the wheel do it then he spoke to
the pilot once more come on mister lets
get out o here before we get barnacles
growin all over our toe-nails

  black john climbed to the upper bridge
and pulled the handle of the telegraph to
stand by the bell clanged far beneath
in the engine-room the engine-room
answered

  he raised his hand and tugged angrily at
the cord above his head and the raucous
screech of the whistle in the damp air sent
out a warning to the men on the quayside
and to the missing hands gathered in a
melancholy little group at the lock and to
the prosperous and virtuous owner walking
pompously toward the dock gates and to
the owners daughter watching from the
shelter of the coal tips that the ss medea
was about to set off on her long voyage
westward

  rain was falling softly as the big tramp
moved slowly ahead with the dockmaster
bellowing orders through a megaphone and
the shore-men in oilskins hauling the heavy
bow and stem hawsers from bollard to
bollard

  a thin derisive yell went up from the
men at the lock head

  here she is bys op aboard or yell
miss the treat o yer life be a sailor an
see the world

  yah look at her the ugly flat-nosed
hooker

  the medea stopped in the lock as the
gates were opened a ladder was placed
against the bulwarks of the after well-deck
and the hands came scrambling aboard

  suffering snakes said the second mate
from the poop drunk as blazes the lot
of em

  there was one man far too drunk even
to stand on his feet a big broad-shouldered
man with fiery red hair and no hat two
other men sober enough to know what they
were doing held him by his arms and
dragged him toward the ladder

  get that man aboard roared the second
mate do you hear

  make haste chum said a little pale-
faced man with scared eyes make haste
or theyll leave you

  the red-haired man did not speak un-
resisting body and legs limp and helpless


adventure

he let himself be hauled up the ladder he
and the two men who had him in charge
the one pulling the other pushing fell over
the bulwark rail on to the deck

  get up said the little deck-hand
here whats up are you bad

  the red-haired man groaned

  get forard you lubbers said the
second mate sharp

  the red-haired man rolled over into the
scuppers where he lay unmolested while
the medea edged her way out through the
lock gates toward the open water

on the bridge the pilot was pre-
paring to drop over the side into his
steam-cutter

  will you sign my note capn thank
you ah light ship across the westard
eh shouldnt care for it myself capn
no growled black john dare say
you wouldnt dont care for it myself
neither

  the pilot had a grievance

  cardiff roads pilotage would yer be-
lieve it eh why dont you capns do some-
thin about it eh

  do what said black john what can
we do nothin pay for a barry roads
pilot out of our own pockets thats all
no mister we cant do nothin

  always tell what kind of owners you got
capn just from that its a mean firm
what only pays for cardiff roads pilotage
a mean firm

  he looked at black john for confirmation
of this view but black john gazed ahead
and said nothing

  well capn the pilot went on heres
the outer wrack buoy all right so ill say
good-by an wish yer a pleasant voyage an
leave yer

on the after well-deck the red-
headed man still lay in the scuppers
huddled up covered with coal-dust
here whats this

  the boatswain turned him over with his
foot

  you lemme be said the red-headed

man see or youll be sorry - ive

a head on me

  the boatswain a big gloomy ulsterman
whose temper had suffered from a difference
of opinion with the mate yanked the red-
haired man to his feet

  get forard he said

  the red-haired man blinked and gazed
around him as if trying to account for his
presence aboard ship

 why he said thickly why -

whats wrong where am i eh he
staggered to the bulwarks why-why
were movin

  there was a laugh

 whatd you think we were doin
youre aboard the medea bound for hali-
fax get on forard

  the red-haired man cursed then he
stumbled toward the bridge and climbed
the ladder the boatswain staring after him
with the look of one not quite sure if he can
believe the evidence of his eyes

  the red-haired man was half-way up the
ladder that led to the flying bridge when
black john saw him

 what the - do you want he

growled

  i want you said the red-haired man
you with the brass buttons put me
ashore

  black john glared at him in speechless
amazement

  stop the-ship dyer hear shouted

the red-haired man i never signed on at
all put me ashore

  black john dorrock uttered a yell of
rage

  whats that you say you come here
givin orders an flingin yer weight about
will you

  he ran a few steps down the ladder and
then holding on to the rails and using his
foot as a lever he caught the red-haired
man a blow in the chest with the sole of his
boot and sent him sprawling in a heap on
the lower bridge

  you come up here again by james an

ill clap you in irons bosun what the-

do you mean by lettin that tough come
bargin up here

  the second mate chuckled the same
old game the sea the sea that never
changed that never had and never would
the voyage not an hour old the course just
set and trouble already and what else
had he come to sea for but trouble trouble
always from port to port but what a
gang lord what a gang for a decent
man to live with

  he paced to and fro on the bridge glanc-
ing keen-eyed into the drizzle

  presently his spirits lifted and he began to
whistle a tune
the tramp



 black john looked out of the chart-room
 abaft the wheel-house

 mister

 sir said the second mate

 stop that-noise

v

a there was no moon and the
clouds hid the stars from the deck
of the medea nothing could be seen
but the occasional lightening of the black-
ness as the crest of a wave went scudding
past the rail no sound broke the stillness
of mid-atlantic but the fret of the wind in
the funnel stays and the splash of water and
the clang of a furnace-door or a slice or
shovel falling on the floor of the stoke-hole
and the slow steady throb of the engines-
phoom-tah phoom-tah phoom-tah-that had
never changed since leaving the bristol
channel

 black john dorrock came out of his room
 on the lower bridge buttoning his heavy
 coat and climbed the ladder to the flying
 bridge he stood for a moment by the tele-
 graph peering into the night then he
 glanced quickly left and right and saw the
 mate whose watch it was huddled up on the
 starboard wing of the bridge

 mister he said

 the mate did not answer

 the wind was freshening the medea
 shivered and a wave swept over the fore-
 castle head

 black john moved slowly to where the
 mate was leaning over the rail

 mister he said a littie more sharply

 still there was no answer black john
 flared into a quick anger he strode for-
 ward quickly and brought his hand down
 hard on the mates shoulder

 mr lappett wake up

 the mate turned swiftly

 yes sir

 what the-do you mean by it

 mean by what said the mate

 dont pretend you were sound asleep
 an you know it

 i beg yer pardon sir i wasnt asleep

 you were asleep mister think im
 inaginin things

 dunno about that sir but i wasnt
 asleep

 listen to me mr lappett said dor-
 rock you were asleep i called to you
 three times before you heard me whats

the good of tryin to stuff me into believin
youre deaf or half-witted if ever a man
was asleep on his watch it was you an
whats more if you stand there arguin ill
log you drop it ive had enough of your
sodjerin mister the sooner you mend
yer ways the better for all of us

  he turned and walked away to the chart-
room leaving the thin-lipped mate glaring
after him in the blackness and swearing by
all that he held sacred such gods as he ac-
knowledged that he would get even with
him if it took him a year or ten years be-
cause black john dorrock a miserable
brandy-drinking twister happened to be in
command - as low-minded and foul-
mouthed as the toughest deck-hand that
ever staggered blind drunk out of the dens
of tiger bay-he thought he could make
life miserable by lies and threats for men
better than himself

  -him to-with a man like that

he would go on in the same old way black
john would eaten up with his own con-
ceit and then one day he would go too far
and-click-the mates teeth met with a
snap-he would get him

  a little before eight bells the second mate
arrived on the bridge

  the mate spoke to him in a low voice

  what dyou think black john comes
sneakin up on me without makin a sound
an because im leanin over the rail an
dont ear him he threatens to log me for

bein asleep by - if it hadnt been

here on the - bridge id have half

killed im the misrable liar one o
these days jimmy ill make that crooked
old shark sorry he ever left home

  eight bells sir said the man at the
wheel

  the mate growled and moved across to
the bell hanging in front of the wheel
house

  the eight deep-toned notes rang out
sharply

   clong-clong clong-clong clong-clong clong-
clong

  the smaller bell on the forecastle head
answered

  clang-clang clang-clang clang-clang
clang-clang

  and the sing-song voice of the lookout
came faintly

  all lights burnin bright sir an alls
well

  the man at the wheel was relieved by
o

adventure

one of the other watch he came out of the
wheel and approached the mate

  west by north a quarter north he
said

  west by north a quarter north re-
peated the mate he spoke to jimmy
well if i got to be up ere in four hours
time id better get some shut-eye lord
wish sometimes i was dead might as well

be as serve under a-like yon but

hell get his one o these days jim lad
jhe chuckled well im off west by
north a quarter north

   west by north a quarter north it is
said jimmy

the mate clattered down the ladder and
he went into the wheel-house glanced at
the binnacle and then began his four hours
watch

   he paced leisurely to and fro from one
side of the bridge to the other balancing
himself against the uneasy tilt and dip of
the vessel high up out of the water the
wind fresh and cold on his face his hands
deep in the pockets of his coat

  he thought of what lappett had told
him and he grinned dorrocks version of
the story would be worth hearing

  jimmy knew that black john had taken
a dislike to him again and again it seemed
as if he went out of his way to find fault-
for no reason so far as it was possible to
discover on the other hand the mate was
a bad egg a hypocrite filthy-minded
sly and vicious the kind of man who
boasted about his own good qualities and
gossiped about the failings of his shipmates
behind their backs of the two black john
with all his faults his language and his
coarseness and his fierce bursts of drinking
when ashore was the better man

  besides jimmy comforted himself with
the reflection-there never had been a ship
yet sail or steam oil-tank liner or tramp
but that you would find if you dug down
sufficiently deep hatred and jealousy and
spite somewhere

   the captains burly figure loomed up in
the darkness he did not speak to jimmy
nor did jimmy speak to him

  the man at the wheel coughed

   one bell sir

  jimmy banged the clapper against the
rim of the brass bell

   clong

   there was no answer from the head

   mr kerrill said black john gruffly

    sir 

  t run forard an kick that - lookout
  till he wont sleep again for a week see

  go yerself i dunno what in - they

   think this ship is make haste

    very good sir

    jimmy slid down the ladders on to the
  bridge-deck and ran forward

    on the forecastle head he saw a man lying
   motionless wedged between a ventilator
   and the steam windlass he stooped and
   shook him by the shoulder

   wake up

    the man groaned

    jimmy dropped on his knees and groped
  in his pocket for a box of matches by the
  flickering light of a match held in his cupped
  hands he saw that the lookout was the little
  man whom he had seen helping the red-
  headed man on board the ship the day they
  sailed there was blood on his face

    he opened his eyes and then the flame
  died down and they were in darkness once
  more

   what the-s the matter with you

  garle said jimmy what happened
  i wasnt doing any harm sir no sir
  but theres things been said sir

    jimmy cut him short

    but how did you get like this

    dunno sir im not sure sir i was
  standing here sir and i heard some one
  come up the ladder behind me and then i
  felt something hit me-i didnt remember
  anything more sir not till you came

    he struggled to his feet

   - i feel queer

    hang on a bit ill go and see whats to
   be done

    jimmy went aft to the bridge

    well said black john

    jimmy explained

    black john flared back at him

    look here mr kerrill what dyou take
   me for seems to me ive got a pack o
   lunatics to dry nurse not officers to help
   me do you mean to tell me you believed
   that yarn about some one hittin him-stuff
   an nonsense

     theres blood all over his face sir said
   jimmy

    if the old fool wouldnt believe him he
   wouldnt he might go and stick his head
   in a furnace before hed argue

    go forard again an find the man who
  hit him then

    orders were orders but what the blazes
the tramp



did black john think he was one of the

deck-hands-or what -his eyes

  perhaps there was something to be said
for the mate after all

  look here you garle said jimmy
when he reached the forecastle head once
more are you all right

  yes sir said the little deck-hand
yes sir

  hm and you can stand your trick at
the wheel eh who was it hit you any
idea

  no sir

  there was a note of alarm in the little
mans voice

  any one got it in for you

  no sir ive got no enemies on board
sir not so fars i know sir

   youre lying o course well serves you
right if you wont tell me

  no sir i dont lie whatever my
faults may be sir-whatever the sins ive
got on my soul sir-im no liar maybe
if it hadnt been for the drink sir id have
been a preacher by now sir preaching the
gospel but-

without waiting for the little man
to finish a long drawn-out explana-
tion which was on the face of it mere
driveling lunacy jimmy kerrill went down
the ladder into the well-deck and very cau-
tiously peered into the seamans forecastle
dimly lit by a paraffin lamp and smelling of
damp clothes and sweat and heavy body
odors and tobacco and warmed by a small
bogie that smoked from the pipe and made
the close and stifling atmosphere almost un-
breathable

  jimmy entered the narrow iron pen and
approached the bunks one over another
where the hands who had come off watch
were sleeping

  here you said jimmy wake up
the man nearest him opened his eyes and
grounted

  any of you men know who hit that man
garle

  no one answered and then a slow
sneering voice said

  whos that kickin up that-noise in

here get out whoever you are
certain now that he was bound to have
trouble jimmy made his way to the bunk
at the far end of the forecastle from which
the voice had come

  whos sleeping here who are you eh

 ft

  the man in the bunk had his head cov-
ered with a coat he did not move his
breathing was slow and regular jimmy
know that he was shamming to be aleep
he shook him by the arm

 who the-are you he demanded

youre not asleep answer me

 an who the-are you

  before jimmy could dodge the man in
the bunk had flung his coat over his head
and hurled himself over the side of the bunk
on top of him hitting with both fists

  ill teach you

  jimmy pinned to the wreckage of the
table that collapsed under the combined
weights of himself and his opponent did
his best to ward off the storm of blows that
came raining down on him the coat ham-
perred him but he worked himself free and
hit back at the face above him hidden in
the shadow of the lamp and feeling no pain
from the battering he received

  all at once the man he was fighting
gripped him tight around his body under
his arms jimmy felt that his ribs would
break under the strain he could not breathe
his senses were leaving him in another
moment he would be done finished- oh
god the pressure on his body increased
his chest was cracking but his arms were
still free

  making one last supreme effort he crashed
his right fist into the deck-hands face the
deck-hand grunted as if with surprize and
loosened his grip sufficiently for jimmy to
draw his breath jimmy hit him again
with his left under the chin the man
seemed shaken at last and gave way
jimmy found that he was free

  what the-do you mean by it he

asked it was difficult to keep his voice
steady

  suddenly the man jumped

  a hard drive in the jaw sent jimmy
smashing against the iron bulkhead the
pain in his head made him feel sick and
dizzy if the deck-hand attacked him now
he was beaten he knew

  but the deck-hand stood panting for
breath his hands by his sides his lips drawn
back from his teeth

  had enough

  and then jimmy recognized the red-
haired man hannigan who persisted that
hannigan was not his name that he had not
been to sea for fifteen years and that he
had been drugged and taken aboard the


adventure

medea when in no condition to realize
what was happening a bad-tempered surly
beast who had given nothing but trouble
ever since they had left cardiff

  hannigan what the-have you been

playing at what dyou mean by it
dont you know who i am

  hannigan gave a start of surprize or
what was intended as such

  my- he said why its the sec-
ond mate im sure i beg yer pardon sir
i thought it was one o the firemen havin a
joke sir

  a lie jimmy knew from the mocking
gleam in the mans close-set eyes and his
grin but what was the use of arguing
with a man who still had the use of his two
fists and could hit as hard as hannigan
could

  talk sense he said

  well sir why didnt you say who you
was at once an anyway now you are
here sir is there anything yer do want or
what

  the mans insolence made jimmy itch to
swing at him once more but his aching
head was a warning not to be disregarded

  i want to know who was the man who
hit garle

  no one here sir said hannigan we
didnt know the poor little feller was hit
he climbed once more into his bunk
jimmy feeling that he had been made to
look foolish but through no fault of his own
went out of the forecastle and walked slowly
aft to the bridge

  well said black john youve been
long enough about it mister did yer find
the man

  no sir said jimmy

  you didnt find him you mean to say
you just stood there chewin the rag askin
questions an swallowin all they said to
you he laughed under his breath my

- mister what made you think you were

cut out to be a sailor eh why didnt you
stay ashore to take up preachin or pushin
a pen for a livin or sellin silk stockins or
somethin quiet an peaceable on your
own showin one of the hands knocked that
lookout man out an yet you dont do nothin
to find who did it seems to me mister
the sooner you change yer vocation an get
a job teachin a girls school to dance the
better for all of us

  the second mate stared into the dark-
ness the pain in his head where his skull

had crashed against the bulkhead throbbed
to the slow phoom-tah phoom-tah phoom-
tah of the engines he felt too tired to talk
his teeth had cut into his tongue and his
lip was bleeding his ribs were sore
nevertheless he grinned in spite of his
bruises as he listened to black johns bitter
description of his failings

  mister the captain concluded you
want a nurse thats the truth o the mat-
ter you want a nurse how in-they

think im goin to run a ship with the dubs
they give me for officers lord knows i
dont might as well throw discipline to
the winds i suppose before you left the
forecastle you kissed thehands good-night
an tucked em up eh

  without waiting for a reply black john
stumped down the ladder to his own room

  at eight bells the mate was back on the
bridge

  wheres the stinker he asked

  who the old man said jimmy
who else whats he been doin any-
thing out o the ordinary

  dont think so said jimmy told
me he didnt think much o me said i
ought to be home lookin after a nursery-

or something -old bottle-washer for

no reason either hes captain of course
and he can say what he likes ive got to
listen well whats the odds i dare say
black john has his troubles same as the
rest of us

  the mate came so close to him that
jimmy could feel his hot breath on his
cheek

  mister he whispered hell go too far
hes got me to reckon with blast him
hes said things no mans ever said before
you get me i mean what i say mister
ill get him all right that blood-sucker
cant treat me like a lump o muck ill
break even with him if i have to do it with

my own-hands

  will you said jimmy

  i will said the mate im a man of
my word you wait ill break him
jimmy wondered

vi

forty-eight hours had passed
since the medea had entered the
thick white blanket of fog that
shrouded the stars by night and the sun
by day
the tramp



  the morning was very cold and still
save for the slow progress of the vessel the
wash and the wake not a ripple stirred the
calm surface of the sea the long blasts of
the whistle every two minutes and the
steady beat of the engines seemed to make
the silence of the enveloping fog more no-
ticeable and deadening

  mr lappett made his way slowly to the
forecastle head where he stood by the side
of the lookout man and peered into the im-
penetrable whiteness stamping his feet and
hissing through his clenched teeth

   cold isnt it he said at last

  the lookout man muffled in oilskins and
a woolen muffler grunted an unintelligible
reply

  mr lappett surprized turned and saw
hannigans hard face with the broken nose
and the bushy red eyebrows and the fierce

eyes

  huh its you hannigan is it hear
anythin

  no nothin

  the mate considered whether he should
ask hannigan whether he was accustomed
to speak to officers with so little respect or
not and then he noticed what he had no-
ticed several times before in the past week
the purple swelling under hannigans right
eye

  oh hannigan he said in a matter-of-
fact tone ive been meanin to ask you
for some days - who marked you been
scrappin my man or what

  hannigan scowled

  scrappin he said he spoke deliber-
ately as if making up his mind whether he
should answer or not scrappin well in
a way yes an in a way no there aint
no one aboard this packet mister what
knows what scrappin is

  he gave a grim laugh and it was not the
chill damp of the fog that made mr lap-
pett shiver as he listened

  oh he said that so reckon yer-
self a bit of a bruiser eh

  i do said the man im past my
prime now but there was a time mister
when there was few pros would have cared to
stand up agin me in the ring without gloves
on not even old bob fitzsimmons him-
self an even now mister im a tough
nut to crack

  well no need to give us a song an
dance about it said the mate who
landed you in the eye eh

  the red-haired man stirred restlessly
no one accident he growled
wont happen again

  no said mr lappett dare say not
next time youll croak him before he can
cut loose eh

  for a moment mr lappett thought that
he had gone too far the red-haired man
glared at him from under the brim of his
souwester then he shrugged his shoulders
and laughed

  youre right mister next time the
man what done this- he touched his eye-
lid-the man what done this will be sorry
he aint home with his mammy

  the mate whistled softly

  well my man mebbe youre all right

seems to me you think a -uva lot o

yourself whatever you are

  reason to mister cause why im
on board ship where i oughtnt to be im
no ruddy deck-hand same as ive said
pretty nigh every day since i found myself
crawlin round this hereblasted deck none
o youd believe me o course cant say i
blame yer but i wont forget im bidin
my time when i gets my chance i take it
they call me hannigan they can call me

what they-well likes it dont matter

to me theres some aboard this packet
mister that ought to know me but dont
want to one anyway

  whos that asked the mate

  thats tellin said the deck-hand
mebbe youll know before youve finished
he will whoever else dont an whats
more hell be sorry he didnt see the last o
me years ago same as he hoped

  oh said mr lappett most inter-
estin most seems to me my man
youre a customer worth dodgin what
do you do when youre home not a cabi-
net minister by any chance are you
me said the man frowning no
mister i got more sense than them stiffs
me i went into partnership with a friend
o mine year or so back sailors boardin-
house etcetry when i get back ill pull
the roof off the house to find out how i come
to be steered aboard this packet with a skin-
ful o dope i got my suspicions if theyre
correct-some onell be hurt bad an it
wont be me

  he laughed shortly and spat his chew of
tobacco into the fog

  sailors boardin-house eh said mr
lappett considering thats good i


adventure

know one man who makes a pretty good
thing from that pertickler line o philan-
thropy-with the extras o course-lime-
house larry know him

  limehouse larry said the red-headed
seaman slowly and there was in his voice a
note of what might have been termed re-
spect are you a friend of limehouse
larrys mister

  so so said mr lappett he aint
the kind of man id care to ave shoutin
after me on james street corner but i did
him a service once helped him out of a
scrape an im tellin no lie when i say
theres nothin larry wouldnt do in return
if i asked him ive been in one or two
little business deals with larry neither of us
ave ever regretted

  if youre a friend of limehouse larrys
mister said the red-headed seaman you
ought to be able to find your way round
without askin no policeman the way hes
got a lot o power in cardiff limehouse
has

  mr lappett nodded

  any one i recommended to limehouse
as bein on the square ed use he paused
only-id ave to be sure of my man
lookin for proof like said hanni-
gan eh mister

  yes said mr lappett im not
askin questions i dont have to but-what-
ever you are now whatever you may have
been doin lately-you were a sailor oncel
in that blow we ad last week there was no
one but you in the whole crew who could
keep the old hooker on her course

  hannigan looked at the mate with con-
tempt in his eyes

  yes he said i was a sailor once
if you want to know more about me mis-
ter go an ask black john dorrock back on
the bridge there hell tell yer thats to
say if he aint chose to forget things he
dont want to remember ask him

  the mate was startled

  mean to say you sailed with the cap-
tain

  mean to say nothin said the red-
haired man

  youll be pretty hard up for money by
the time you reach ome said mr lappett
presently

  theres more ways o earnin money
mister than by drawin another mans pay
as an ab aboard this packet

  youre not pertickler i suppose

  the deck-hand and the mate glanced at
each other quickly and then each turned
and stared ahead into the fog as before

  no said hannigan i aint particular
anything in your mind mister

  no but mebbe youre the man im
lookin for ive got a scheme-sometimes
things crop up-mebbe ill need you i pay
well

  he walked back to the bridge

he had debts to settle life
was full of perplexities the long-
est way round was often the quick-
est way through in the end hannigans
talk had puzzled him the man was a mys-
tery one thing was clear-he knew dor-
rock he had sailed with him in days gone
by and judging not so much from his
words as from his looks and his manner lie
had reason to hate him

  decidedly hannigan was a man worth
keeping in view

  the mate reached the bridge

  black john spoke to him without turn-
ing his head

  well what do you make of it now mis-
ter eh

  thick as ever seen nothin eard
nothin

  black john dorrock grunted and con-
tinued to gaze into the fog presently he
spoke again without moving his eyes

  dont like it mister eight days dead
recknin no sun no stars no ruddy hori-
zon forty-eight hours thick fog no catch
is it mister eh

  the mate sniffed and smiled black
john had been drinking brandy again he
would of course black john was
scared

  no mister i dont like it

  theres nothin to worry about sir
said mr lappett

  no said black john with heavy sar-
casm im glad to hear it i am honest

mister youre a wonder a-wonder

he screwed up his eyes and sucked in his
breath between his teeth we aint lost
if thats what you mean

  the mate looked at him and said nothing

  no black john went on an as long
as we got wireless workin an nothin goes
wrong we know where we are when
were gettin near land anyhow cape
race an chebucto head gave us our bear-
ins in the mornin watch thats all right
the tramp

night but-

  well said lappett presently you
said but sir

  yes an i meant it wireless aint
goin to pick us up an steer us clear of all
harm past rocks an shoals an steamers
straight into halifax harbor is it mister
no sir but all the same sir just be-
cause theres a bit of a fog it dont seem to
me theres no reason to worry

  black john turned at last and looked at
the mates yellow tight-skinned face and
thin lips and then he smiled

  suppose youll say next wed be quite
safe mister to cut right ahead full speed

an to-with the fog

  lappett wriggled uneasily

  in a manner o speakin yes sir i al-
ways old with what they used to say un-
official sir in the old blue star the faster
you go through fog the faster you reach
clear weather an sun this dodgin aroun
dead slow half-speed stoppin listenin
whistlin aint good for no one us nor the
other feller-thats my opinion

  wonderful said black john won-
derful

  halifax aint near enough yet sir said
lappett for us to begin panickin

  who the-s panickin said black

john

  no one sir no one

  mister said black john after a long
silence id look funny wouldnt i if i
rang the telegraph full ahead an let blind

into this-fog eh youve never had

command of a ship of your own have you
eh an let me tell you mister if you ran
things the way youd like me to run em you
wouldnt have command of her long mis-
ter suppose anything happens to the
medea whos responsible not you you
bet not whose ticket would go not
yours mister

  mr lappett shrugged his shoulders a
sudden swirl of anger swept over him
he hated black john a little more than he
had ever hated him before

  well sir he said you know your own
business best o course

  should-well think i do said black

john with a short laugh its easy enough
to be mate an not worry well make hali-
fax tonight all bein well an with a couple
o days or so coal left in the bunkers-thats
somethin to think of aint it suppose

that gale had lasted you didnt worry
mister did you when the wind was drivin
us way off our course why should you
you aint responsible i am but i tell
you lappett i never take the medea across
the westard light ship without bein
mighty thankful soon as i make port
whats more im no coward

  and he glared at lappett as if he dared
him to contradict

  no sir said lappett why no sir
o course not

  one bell sounded

  through the fog there came the faint
moan of a steamers whistle like a cow in
distress

  hullo-whats that

  hannigan hailed the bridge

  steamer on the port bow sir

 the medeas whistle blared out a
warning

  the little group on the bridge the mas-
ter the mate and the big irish boatswain
waited straining their ears leaning for-
ward

  presently out of the thick sound deaden-
ing blanket of white fog the other steamers
whistle hooted once more

  big feller said black john

  he pulled the whistle-cord

  again there came the reply out of the
fog

  brrh black john growled hes
cornin up too fast

  jimmy kerrill ran up the bridge-ladder
eight bells sounded another deck-hand
arrived to relieve the man at the wheel

  the eight strokes of the other steamers
bell carried across the water to the medeas
bridge

  that aint port sir said the boat-
swain suddenly thats starboard

  black john rang the telegraph to stop
and the engine room answered the slow
beat of the engines died away the medea
rose and fell on the slow heavy swell of the
north atlantic black john pulled the
whistle-cord twice in succession two long
drawn screeches the warning to navigate
with caution

  in the cold stillness the noise of the other
steamer approaching came clear and dis-
tinct

  ill give em the letter r said black
john he made the signal by whistle-
short long short way is ojf my ship
you may feel your way past me


adventure

  and then the mate muttered

 why my- theres two o them-

port an starboard-listen

  it was jimmy kerrill leaning over the
port wing of the bridge who saw the liner
first

  look he said sharply see that
the fog lifted for an instant and there
came a faint misty glimpse of a huge black
hull and many port-holes red boot topping
the white wash of the stem white deck-
houses a lofty bridge a red-and-black-and-
white funnel churning past and then the
fog swirled down again once more and the
gap was choked and the liner vanished

  and said jimmy kerrill thats what
they call going slow why their slows
faster than our full speed ahead

  black john dorrock chuckled and glanced
at mr lappett who said nothing

  theres that other feller still said the
boatswain you can hear him

  believe hes stopped said the second
black john rang the telegraph to slow
ahead

messin about like this he growled
the medea moved forward once more the
whistle screeching at two-minute intervals

  seems like hes right ahead of us said
jimmy hear that

 cant hear because of our own -

whistle said black john dont talk
and then there was a wild yell of warn-
ing from the forecastle head as out of the
fog there loomed the dim shape of another
steamers stumpy masts and funnel imme-

diately ahead of the medea and so close
that it seemed to the men on the bridge im-
possible that a collision could be averted

  recognition of danger and action were
simultaneous black john shouted at the
man at the wheel hard a port and then
waited leaning heavily against a wooden
awning upright head thrust forward teeth
clenched shoulders hunched like the shoul-
ders of a fighter receiving punishment
nerves taut glaring at the oncoming
steamer fiercely eyes puckered as if by
sheer force of will and energy and eyesight
he could save his ship

  slowly so slowly that time and space
seemed to have lost all meaning the bows
of the two steamers turned aside sufficiently
far to permit their hulls free passage
through the churned up water

  by - weve done it said black

john by-

  he choked a lump that rose to his throat
his ship was safe

  as the port wings of the two bridges came
abreast he stared at the men on the other
ship and grinned uneasily as a man will grin
when he has cheated death

  near thing that said the mate cast-
ing a quick look at black johns hard face
near as i want sir

  just as well i wasnt foolish enough to

listen to your - advice mister said

black john satisfied

  one bell sir said the man at the wheel
black john stumped off to the chart-
room

author of malapai ranch

inon lay under the very shadow
of the sierras lofty gray wall
and was watered by swift moun-
tain streams bordered by cot-
tonwoods and filled with big salmon trout
these swiftly foaming waters never went
dry as the placer streams did for they were
fed perennially by melting snow from the
high sierras so pinon was beautifully
grassed and dotted with fruit and alfalfa
ranches with here and there a bunch of
cattle the little town looked from the
other mountains that hemmed the desert
on the east like a ribbon of green velvet
edging the flat yellow blanket of desert

  in the summer the ranchers drove their
herds up on to the sierra benches where
the juicy grasses were thick and high and
in september the yellow road threading
that band of vivid green on the deserts
edge was kept in a ferment of dust for days
churned up by the hoofs of thousands of
cattle herded back on the ranches for the
winter for in september the sierra peaks
began trying on their winter snow-caps
and those richly-grassed mountain benches
would presently be deep in snow

  then was pinon filled with brown sinewy
cow-punchers straddling along the board-
walk which edged the one irregular street
with the stiff-legged gait of men who sat a
saddle for most of their waking hours
but as stiff leather chaps high-heeled

boots and heavy mexican spurs do not
make walking easy the pasear down
pifions main street was merely taken
because it was the road to the cowboys
rest the ranchers retreat and half
a dozen more-through the swing-doors of
which came the sound day and night of
the clicking of poker chips of voices raised
in song or argument

  in pinon the ranchers reared large
families and there were many mexicans
who knew that the range riders held their
lives but little more valuable than those
of the indians so they kept to themselves
and lived very quietly hence with the
mexicans offering no excuse for reprisal
with women and children acting as a check
on their actions at home the tiny mining
town of drybones on the opposite edge of
the desert valley allured with promise of
wild unchecked hilarity

  but the long continued quiet of pinon
was broken the day that steve ransom
pulled his sweating horse to a standstill
in front of the ranchers retreat left
the over-ridden bronco with heaving sides
and hanging head clanked into the saloon
and announced

  jack logans wife has just been knocked
down an robbed by that thievin skunk
manuel estrada up the road near jacks
ranch-an-an-theres reasons why it
might go special hard with her jest now


adventure

  get estrada steve demanded tod
clemmons

  logan did-trailed him through the
chaparral back o his shack an shot him

careful where hed suffer like - an

die slow

  wheres john nowpersisted clemmons
gone loco-huntin greasers-swears
hell kill em all headin this way now
it was the spark needed to touch off the
powder for the round-up was over quiet
games of pool and poker had already begun
to pall the inbred animosity to greasers
awaited but a good excuse for violent
action-and mrs jack logan was greatly
liked

  chairs were pushed back pool and card
games forgotten even whisky glasses were
left undrained and hardly a word was spok-
en as the roomful of vigorous hard-bitten
young fellows arose felt the butts of their
revolvers and made for the door

  tod clemmons added a working slogan
for their seething anger-

  boys he said emphatically the
greasers must go

  you betcha agreed steve ransom

well clean this town by-

  quickly the broncos sleeping in the sun
were jerked to life and a dozen lean wiry
men with six-guns drawn galloped up the
street the five mexicans in tonys
the one isolated mexican saloon in town
had no chance for life as a volley from the
mad punchers fired as fast as six-guns
could be fanned poured through the open
doorway into the dark adobe room but
one mexican fired back and before his
body was riddled he dropped steve ran-
som with a shot through the stomach
which added fuel to an already hot fire

  after wiping out tonys place the en-
raged riders turned to the mexican settle-
ment the cooler heads among them rode
from door to door of the small wooden
shacks where the dark-eyed southern
families dwelt telling them curtly

  vamoose by ten oclock tonight git
and dont ever come back

  then was there hurried bundling together
of bedding and cooking utensils and burros
laden to the point of eclipse staggered
slowly out of town into the desert driven
by fearful despairing mexicans wailing and
mourning for their dead and for ruined
homes crying of madre di dias and
calling to all the saints

  but on the edge of dark the more venge-
ful townsmen hurried the exodus by shoot-
ing at the barricaded doorways of the ones
who had not already left

  at sun-up next morning jack logan who
had raged through the country all night like
a madman spied three heavily laden figures
toiling up a steep trail into the sierras
three miles from town with an oath he
forced his tired horse to gallop up the trail
where broncos were only expected to walk
overtook the fugitives shot them all and
left them where they fell

  in a day some rather listless bored
young cow-punchers had been transformed
into killers yet they would have hotly
denied the name of bad men since they
considered their cause just their spirits
were keyed up to a fierce excitement and
their trigger-fingers still itched but now
the greasers were gone and pinon was
dead-deader than it had ever been before
with the reaction that comes after hot
tragedy

  boys said tod clemmons its me
fer drybones-this towns safe now-also
its like a bottle after the last drink

  you betcha same here us fer
drybones came the chorus and the little
troop of punchers swung their shuffling
broncos down onto the level desert floor
and headed for drybones which showed
a huddle of brown patches against the yel-
low sand thirty miles away

pgfm big tim clancy was sheriff and
pltim didnt believe in guns either
kflifcjl for himself or another when natural
means could effect his object big tim
was seldom in his office at el nojas for
he was giving drybones much of his at-
tention he was in that town when the troop
of men from pinon arrived and though no
news had yet leaked in of the mexican
evacuation tim had chanced to meet a
mexican struggling through the sand a few
miles from drybones the mexican was
half dead from grief and wholly exhausted
by his long-borne household gear but tims
humane treatment brought forth the story
in a wild gush of emotion-so tim followed
the visitors from pinon with a keen eye and
mentally checked them off

  they were lined up in the miners
delight every man with a heavy gun on
his hip when clancy brushed through the
swing doors and stood just inside his great
the judgment o god



bulk nearly blotting out the blazing desert
light behind him

  mornin boys i see youre wearin
your artillery

  yes spoke up tod clemmons an
what about it an who might you be
stranger

  im the new sheriff drybones is my
particular pet spot in this here county
for the sake o law an order all gents is
required to cache their shootin irons with
the bartenders or at the hotel fifteen min-
utes after they hits this town an they
dont git em back till fifteen minutes before
they leave town now you boys been
here half an hour by my watch an as
you dont know the rulin ill excuse you-
but ill ask you to lay them guns on the bar
tom there will treasure em careful till
youre ready to vamoose-savvy

  jake sleshinger young and hot-headed
and tall as the sheriff flashed back-

  we dont give up our guns fer nobody-

to-with your rulin

  but jake-until yesterday innocent of
man killing and still full of the unholy joy
of releasing a spurt of flame and seeing his
man drop-made the mistake of watching
clancys gun hand when the sheriffs
hard knotty left fist shot out and drove
against jakes chin he fell like a stone and
lay still

  then before any of the angry ones could
draw clancy ripped out his heavy revol-
ver and slammed it on the bar while his
hot blue eye ranged the line of fierce
faces the tallest on a level with his own
his soft tone was belied by his determined
mouth and the glitter in his eye

  i dont like to collect guns that way
but i will if i have ter he said with a
fleeting grin put them guns on the bar
gentlemen or ill be after taking you all on
one at a time

  tod clemmons whose lead was generally
followed unbuckled his belt with a laugh
and threw belt and gun on the bar

   we aint afraid of you none sheriff but
youre sure a white man and i reckon well
respect your rulin poor cuss- looking
down at the long still figure on the floor-
i dont hanker to ride home to pinon
feelin like he will when he wakes up
now thats ok said the sheriff
you look like a fairly decent bunch-but
i got just this much more to say his
face hardened im sheriff of another

county than yourn but if i knowed the
skunk that plugged tony lorenos little
kid id give him the time o his life

  his quick glance shifted from face to
face but he saw only surprize on the tanned
faces about him

  lorenos kid nobody shot him de-
clared tod

  oh didnt they sneered clancy
when you git a whole brood o kids behind
a thin door an plug it with lead one o the
slugs is liable to meet something inside
picking up his gun from the bar he
shoved it back in its holster spat contemp-
tuously and added

  i met tony out in the desert most dead
with mourning fer little tony one o
your bunch drawee a pattern on his front
door with a gun an one of them bullets got
his kid he seen it through a crack in the
cabin but he wouldnt give me the fellers
name an if i know mexes the feller
that plugged little tony better watch out
you fellers want to remember while youre
in this town that a greasers a human
and swinging about he was gone

  now that said tod clemmons with
conviction is what i call a game sport
all the same he takes the joy out o dry-
bones fer me fer whats the use o cele-
bratin without fireworks im goin ter hit
the trail fer home how about it boys
naw-we aint goin yet drawled
pete huggins we come to make a day an
night of it an we stays-also jake aint
fit to travel yet you go along home tod
if you want to an well bring jake along
when it gets cooler

  but drybones had lost its charm for the
men from pinon the surrender of their
guns in a town that had always represented
to them unbridled liberty made them feel
like boys deprived of their marbles and
they wanted to go home-just as would
those smaller boys they lounged along
the street from bar to bar they played
poker and solo they drank much-but
their beloved six-guns were not handy
why it was almost as bad as being afoot

  along about six oclock when jake
sleshinger sat up on the billiard table where
he had been laid and began to swear
pete huggins asked him-

   feel better jake

   jake smiled feebly

   i have felt better but im able to fork
a bronc if i ride slow


adventure

   dyou shoot up lorenos shack jake

   uh-huh-why

    oh nothin-only the sheriff says some-
 body plugged lorenos kid behind a locked
 door

   suppose said bill simpson breaking
 an uncomfortable silence we pulls our
 freight for pinon an see how jake makes
 it

    to this there was a chorus of assent

    broncos were saddled hastily and eleven
 rather subdued cow-punchers rode out of
 drybones into the desert but when they
 had topped a sandy ridge that ran down
 the desert like a frozen wave they sat up
 straight in their saddles

   my- that looks like pinon afire

 gasped pete huggins for backed by the
 dark sierra wall an intermittent line of
 jets of yellow flame spread along the edge of

	the sand far ahead of them

   old-timer can you make it they in-
 quired anxiously of jake

    i cn make it slow boys he replied
 you get goin pronto an ill mosey along
 at my own gait im gittin my saddle
 legs again with nothing more than
 adiosi they spurred away following a
 faint trail where the sand was harder and
 the badly jolted jake was left to ride alone
 under the fast-gathering desert stars with
 only his thoughts and his bursting head for
 company

   and his thoughts were worse than the
 pains in his head and body for when the
 group of punchers had halted yesterday
 before tony lorenos door and sent a vol-
 ley of bullets into it-shoulder-high-jake
 it was who had lingered when the others
 rode on reloaded his gun and sent a zig-
 zag pattern of lead through the thin panels
 from lintel to sill-then he had ridden on
 alone

   jake sleshinger had always hated tony
 loreno and at last his hatred had been
 licensed to express itself but some one
 had killed little tony loreno a black curly-
 headed laughing little lad of six-and jake
 knew who had done it

   the desert may bring peace and solace
 or it may bring fierce agony of loneliness
 -but to jake it was a horrible black void
 where he was riding alone with thoughts he
 could not ride away from potting a
 greaser in the open when he had been
 warned to quit was one thing-but little
 tony lorenoi he cursed he shouted

aloud to drown his thoughts he spurred
and quirted his tiring bronco-anything
to bring fierce action and change the cur-
rent of his thoughts-but little tony
loreno rode with him

  the sudden spurt of galloping brought
on excruciating pains in his head hammers
were pounding there and shots were
popping-shots like the explosions of six-
guns and one louder than the others
made him reel in his saddle he grasped
the saddle-horn but his feeble fingers slid
away and his body struck the deep sand
with a soft thud while his bronco galloped
on

when tim clancy left the
miners delight he was bound on
an errand to the cerro verde mine
which lay far up in the hills his errand
had to do with the attachment of certain
movable property there for debt the owner
having defaulted on her obligations

  the trip through dark canons and over
rugged trails would consume much of the
day and tim felt uneasy at leaving dry-
bones with the pinon men in town but his
face cleared when he saw lewis mckendrick
galloping up the trail from the south for
mckendrick though a wild harum-scarum
boy was clean and straight and quick as
light with his gun-also he was cool and
fearless the sort who laughed when a fight
was on-and fought the harder for his
laughter

  at tims raised hand mckendrick drew
up sharply

  hold up your right hand kid said
clancy repeating the formula which made
lewis mckendrick a deputy sheriff-and
handing him his star

  why the honors tim laughed mc-
kendrick fastening his deputys badge
on the flannel shirt beneath his flapping
vest

  kid said tim soberly i got to leave
town mebbeso for all day an theres a
bunch from pinon in the delight there
that i dont like to leave alone they

aint really bad boys but-broke loose

in pinon an theyre lit up with some o the
fire i reckon anyway you keep cool an
watch out-ill be back as quick as i can
but itll be evening at the closest adiosi
and tim was off

  on the edge of dark the sheriffs lean
long-stepping range horse came dropping
the judgment o god

i

down through the foothills overlooking
drybones beneath a clear green sky a
flaming rose edged the lofty peaks but the
mighty sierra wall was purple dark and
the desert was dusky gray and where the
deepest shadow lay-where the desert
met the mighty wall-a line of flickering
light flared up in tiny yellow points

  looks like pinons afire said tim
aloud and hastened his horses gait

   he found mckendrick smoking a cigaret
on the hotel porch his chair tilted back at
a comfortable angle

   how was everything kid he asked
nothing doing tim you must a
drawn them hombrcs teeth when you
extracted their artillery tom told me all
about it that pinon bunch pulled out
half an hour ago an drybones sleeps
peaceful

   thanks deputy grinned the big man
say kid theres fires in pinon-you cant
see em from here but they showed up
when i was cornin through the foothills
the sheriff looked down musingly while he
rolled a cigaret-

    taint exactly my business for pinons
in another county but lorton the sheriff
is fifty miles away at gold city

   kid he said suddenly throwing up his
head im goin to pinon i might save
some poor devil of a greaser-for them

boys are full of - today coming

along

  tim grinned mckendrick besides
being willin to travel a long ways with
you i aint never side-stepped excitement
yet you betcha im cornin

   then ill be gettin me another horse
for mines not fresh enough for sixty miles
more hows your bronc

   i only done twenty miles this morning
an the son of a guns been eatin his head
off since you left town

  mckendrick mounted on mesquite the
wisest and speediest cow-pony in the county
took the road to pinon with the sheriff
just as lights twinkled out in the row of one
story false-fronted saloons that lined one
side of drybones only street

- the night fell velvet dark as the two
broncos padded steadily through deep sand
their riders talking little after tim had
told lewis what he had heard from tony
loreno that morning

   those fools in pinon are like a lot of
others growled the sheriff jest cause

a kcmbres got a dark skin an spanish
blood-an mebbeso some indian-they
figure he aint human but theyll learn
different some day them greasers are
good folks if theyre treated square-an
there aint no kinder folks or quicker to
do a feller a favor if you take em right
course they snarl when you kick em like
they was dogs but so would i or you

   then silence save for the creaking of
saddle leather and the soft swishing of
sand under the ponies hoofs

   must be gittin well over the county
line spoke tim at last them lights is
growin nearer but they seem to a died
down some well be in pinon in an hour

   a few rods farther on lewis felt rather
than saw mesquites lifted crest and pointed
ears as he sidled against tims mount to
avoid a shadowy something in the road
then both horses snorted and halted
quivering

   mckendrick swinging down peered for a
moment at a dark huddle directly in the
sandy track

   tim its a man

   striking a match he held its flare to a
lean young face

   its jake sleshinger he continued
one o the pinon boys with a hole in his
head

   but tim did not heed for he was watch-
ing a slight figure that had suddenly ap-
peared out of the darkness

  whos there he demanded quickly
his hand on his gun

   it is tony senor shereef i see you
face by the match and i weesh to geeve
myself to you you see those fire i
fight them all all i no light the senor
logans house the senora she seeck-but
i light hees bams an hees hay-an i hear
those bad hombres coming home say jake
behind-too weak to ride fast i know
their voices-i know them long time-so i
wait for thees hombre an i keel heem for
he-keel my little tony

   the softly liquid voice rose to a passion-
ate tone as he went on

  my little tony who hurt nobody but
always laugh an thees hombre here i
see him through a crack in the wall of my
casa he sit in his saddle after all the
others go an he shoot the top of the door
then he shoot sideways an then he shoot
at the bottom of the door an that last
bullet-low down-he hit my little tony


adventure

then thees jake he curse an ride away
there ees no mexicans left in pinon i was
the only one you hang me i savvy but
i not care what come to me i lost my
little tony an no aint got home any more

  - swore the sheriff under his

breath tony he said gently i aint
sheriff o this county and i aint your judge
you vamoose pronto-and he added
mr mckendrick and i havent seen you
tonight-savvy

  yes senor i savvy gracias

  but there was indifference not hope in
his tones and he was gone melting into
the shadowy sand-dunes and sage

  well kid said the sheriff shaking up
his horse theres nothing for it but to
keep on and report finding this body but o
course we dont know who done it reckon
them pinon hombres is gettin whats
cornin to em

  they spurred their fearful broncos
through the searing heat making for a
house on the slope back of the town where
bright lights shone from the windows and
on the way they met no one and heard no
sound-pinon was a smoking and deserted
ruin

  leaving mckendrick in the road with
the horses clancy rapped on the door of
the large ranch house from which they
had seen the light

  who is it asked a womans voice
nervously through the locked door

  its sheriff clancy from drybones
bolts creaked then and the door swung
slowly open

  wheres john logan he demanded

  i dont know-an i dont care
the overwrought woman answered tartly
when pinon started to burn he cussed
an ramped round the house awful an
when his own ranch buildins began to
blaze something snapped i reckon for
john logans got a hair-trigger brain an
temper he went plumb loco then tearin
round the house like mad he busted
into his wifes room an when he sees her
mexican nurse bendin over the bed he
shot her the body fell across mary
logan an he let it lie there while he stood
watchin fer a minute a crazy look in his
eyes then he jest ran out without sayin
a word stuffin his pockets with cartridges
an galloped off leaving his barns blazin an
that was jest the last straw for mary logan
shes lyin dead upstairs this minute

  clancys deep rough voice softened for
he knew and liked mary logan

  thats sure bad news maam can you
tell me where the rest o the boys have gone
they went skyhootin out into the
desert john logan with em-headin
south aimin to do more murder i
reckon when they found pinon blazin
theres mexican women an kids drove
into the desert-an some of em killed-
an i cant think how them fellers can ever
sleep sound again john logans done the
worst-but- and the solicitude of a
worried mother was in her strained tones-
my boy jake was on the rampage with
the rest

  the big sheriff looked up quickly at that
he had watched mental and physical
suffering in many forms but he felt abashed
before the grief and pain he saw in the
depths of her dark-circled tired eyes and
at the tragedy in her voice

  i-i-reckon i must be goin maam
an thank you

  clancy retreated hastily but as he
swung into the saddle a sudden thought
made him call back to the figure still in
the doorway-

  ill send back some o the boys if i
meet em

then clancy with lewis mcken-
drick rode on into the night and
as he rode he growled-

  she said her boy jake was with that
bunch an i betcha anything in all the
world that her last name is sleshinger
they rode slowly now down the slope
across the fiat alfalfa land and beyond
that down still further into the desert-
and then without warning a shadowy form
on horseback loomed ahead a harsh voice
cried

  greasers -greasers the world is

full o greasers and a heavy gun roared

  an exclamation sounded from mcken-
drick and clancy felt rather than saw
his friends tall form bend forward over the
saddle-horn

  then all his fighting blood awoke and
he fired at the gun-flash in the darkness
again he fired again and again raking
the space ahead at the height of a mounted
man-and some of his shots went home
for he heard a heavy body crash into a clump
of sage while a bronco galloped off into the
night
the judgment o god



   lad are ye hurted bad asked clancy
tenderly as his burly arms lifted mcken-
drick from the saddle and laid him down
on the sand but no voice answered

   clancy struck a match and found where
a heavy bullet had ploughed along lewis
mekendricks scalp he bound the bleed-
ing head tenderly then with other matches
he went hunting further

   its as i thought he muttered its
 murderin jack logan-plumb loco-an
 he wont shoot no more greasers

   bending close to the sand as he was soft
 footsteps close by came to his keen ears
 and the rustling of the sage as some one
 brushed against it his tall figure snapped
 up and his heavy gun was in his hand
 whos there he called

   it is the shereef from drybones

  yep

   we two mexicanos senor who be hunted
 by logan until you ride across hees trail
 an you save us we hear logans body fall

   senor shereef and there was an uncon-
 scious dignity in the soft mexican voice-
 a dignity tinged with the calmness of de-
 spair we have hear that you are square
 hombre even to a mexicano our casas in
  pinon are bum an we not go back even
 if the white men build em new cabin for
 us we go with you mebbeso an make
 homes in drybones

   clancy struck a match and held it up
in the still night air it flared high

  come into the light hombres-id
have a look at ye

   yes he said after glancing keenly at
 the swarthy faces which sprang out of the
 darkness in the match flare ill take ye
 with me-an get behind me pronto he
 ordered curtly for the shots had drawn
 questing cow-punchers in their direction
 and pounding hoofs thudded in the heavy
 sand converging upon the little group-
 for clancys last high-held match had lo-
 cated them completely

   what you doin here sheriff called
 tod clemmons pushing through the sage
 an what was them shots

   the first o them shots said clancy
coolly was fired at us in the darkness
without warnin an it creased mckendrick
whos lyin insensible at me feet the
rest o them shots you heard was fired by
me an john logans lyin over there in
the sand an he wont never move again
till somebody moves him

  didnt i see somebody as i rid up
asked clemmons suspiciously

  ye did an theyre two mexicans be-
hind me back an theyre goin with me to
drybones me back is fair broad feller
an me gun is out an theyll get there if

   clemmons forced a laugh

  i dont blame you sheriff theres

start the blaze

  because i happen to know they didnt
an i give ye my word

said clancy

  they found mckendrick conscious and
lifted him to his horse

  whats that gun doin in yer hand
asked clancy you didnt have time to
draw afore logan plugged ye

   lewis grinned in the darkness

   i woke up in time to hear yer friendly
conversation with clemmons an i wasnt
able ter talk but i managed to pull her

an was waitin to-

  the sound of many riders threading
through the brush came to their ears

   its all right boys called tod its
clancy with two mexicans an he has my
word to take em with him

  which one o you fellers is jake
boomed clancys heavy voice on the desert
night air silence

   the only jake in town sheriff is jake
sleshinger an he aint in from drybones
yet volunteered tod

  well then one o you hombres go to
logans house an tell ma sleshinger that
her boy aint never cornin home exceptin
to be buried we passed him out in the
desert with a bullet in his head an
these mexicans here didnt do that
neither

  seems like you know a lot about it

t time is it now
four-thirty half an hour
more

how come we couldnt sleep
that extra half-hour how come they
drag us up in here in the mud all night
and then we gotta sit in the rain all this
time why couldnt we sleep back in
them woods

 how come yuh askin me i dunno
i aint no officer

  the two soldiers hunched silently into
the collars of their slickers the rain fell
in sheets and the water in the ditch in
which they were sitting was half-way
to their knees they had started at
dusk from some little town they had never
seen before the trucks had unloaded them
there and had marched all night through
numbers of other towns nobody ever
knew the names of those places they were

pilgrimls progress copyright  by leonard h nason

just towns and the outfit always marched
at night

  finally when the road began to get
rough and full of pits and holes they turned
off into some woods they emerged from
these woods on to yet another road and
halted in the ditch no need to tell them
this was the end of the hike those rockets
going up and the faint rattle at intervals
told them they were close to the front line
this was a company of infantry the ditch
was the jumping-off place five a m the
zero hour and these men knew that it
would be the last hour for many of them

  wheres all this barrage we been hearin
so much about said one of the men

  perhaps it would be well to introduce
these two the one with his steel helmet
on over his overseas cap is costello and
the man beside him is named ira hall
both privates of infantry a e f

  well said hall if you listen hard
pilgrims progress



you can hear somethin whistlin by over-
head but it dont seem to bother them
huns a whole lot they keep shootin
lights up just the same

  there was silence after this while the
waiting troops bowed their heads to the
driving rain then suddenly a tremendous
crashing and banging under their very
noses whistles began to blow

  heads up men heads up then
lets go

  and they scrambled out of the ditch
costello and hall moved along side by side
their hearts hammering on all sides they
could hear men sloshing through the mud
it was fairly light but the rain on the eye-
pieces of their gas-masks made seeing
difficult their own barrage proceeded
them-thick acrid stuff like dirty wool

  the men began to breathe more easily
they were still alive and the german
trenches must be pretty near by now may-
be the jerries were all dead then men be-
gan to appear coming toward them through
the smoke hall gripped his rifle and
then he saw that the oncoming figures
all had their hands raised with the palms
open

  the smoke grew thicker and the prisoners
appeared in greater numbers there was
no one with them and no one paid them
any attention except perhaps to motion
them to the rear

  costello stumbled there was a lot of
wire underfoot that had been uprooted by
the bombardment there was more of it
standing the men floundered through the
strands climbed over some of it tore their
clothes and mangled their hands a sudden
clamor of voices and the rattle of breech-
locks

  here they are fellows

  steady now steady

  hold em hold em

  a confused medley of voices shouts
curses with the whir of a flushing par-
tridge a machine gun began firing into their
very faces men began to drop everywhere
somebody gave hall a tremendous blow in
the back

  who done that he cried angrily
turning around

  the force of that knock upset his balance
and he sank on his right arm he dropped
his rifle

  lie down guy said some one the
stretcher-bearers will pick you up

  lie down - said hall but he

could not get upon his feet again

  his shoulder hurt him cruelly and then
he felt a warm sticky wetness trickling
about him there seemed to be a lot of it
his exploring hand came back covered with
blood

  thank god said he i been hit

  the wound was between his shoulder-
blades so that he was unable to inspect
it and judge of its severity he unslung
his pack and regarded it earnestly there
was a tiny hole through the pocket in which
he carried his mcss-kit and the bacon-can
and box of hardtack in the haversack
between his mess-kit and his shoulder
were punched with a jagged keyhole tear

  again he reached a questing hand over
his shoulder he felt tenderly of his back
his hand was not so wet as before the blood
was flowing less freely

  hot dog said hall this will never
do theyll think im camouflagin

  two men came slowly picking their
way through the wire one of them bore
a strange piece of apparatus on his
shoulder

  hey yelled the wounded man first
aid

  the two turned in his direction

  where yuh hit buddy said one drop-
ping to his knees and unrolling a bandage
in the back said hall

  silently the other ripped up the bloody
blouse and shirt and swabbed the wound
with iodin then he rolled up his bandage
again and wrote out a tag

  your mess-kit saved some guys the
trouble of buryin you said the medical-
corps man how come you got hit in
the back

  how should i know i didnt see it
cornin

  you a non-com

  no

   crap-shooter   

  well some but i aint made any money
at it for some time

  strange things happen in this mans
arm maybe you stopped one that was
meant for the looey or the top kick

  the two stretcher-bearers prepared to
move on

  hey said hall dont i get a ride on
that stretcher

  ride- that stretchers for wound-
ed men you can walk all right


adventure

  how far is it

  couple o miles theres a dressin-
station at rambucourt and maybe theyll
let yuh ride on a truck from there

  couple o miles nix i been hikin
since eight oclock last night i aint
goin to walk another step

  suit yourself it aint nothin in our
young life and the two moved off into the
fog

  can yuh compree that muttered hall
bitterly

  he lifted himself to his feet and started
off reeling a little back through the wire
to the dressing-station

behold now our friend hall
seated on a wooden bench clad
comfortably if not neatly in a pair
of coarse gray trousers a loose coat of the
same material and a pajama shirt with
him are two more with similar clothing
all about them is a pleasant green park
white-graveled walks a fountain that plays
merrily enticing vistas leading away to
shady depths and opposite the bench is a
long spacious colonnade the entrance to a
casino wherein is a wonderful spring that
cures every ailment known to man or beast
such a place was vittel where aforetime
french society went to forget its cares
and where at the time of this tale the wrecks
of the actions at cantignychateau-thierry
the vesle and the lawn-party at st mihiel
were being nursed back to usefulness again

  this said hall stretching himself
luxuriously must be old man rileys
home town

  he lighted a cigaret these were issued
regularly and as each soldier received far
more than he could smoke and since the
french yearned for american  tobacco
cigarets were a medium of exchange with
both the military and the civilian popula-
tion of the hospital center

  theyre never goin to get me away from
here without chains said one of the other
men on the bench who wore on the lapel of
his hospital clothing the globe and anchor
that is the symbol of uncle sammys
marine corps

  thats right said hall theres about
three or four million men in the american
army and they all ought to get a chance to
go up to the front i was crazy to get up
till i got there and then about ten seconds
would do me for the rest of my life

  it wouldnt be so bad said the marine
if you went up to the jump-off and had a
day or so to ketch up with your sleep

but- this marchin all night long and

then goin iuto a scrap without any break-
fast a guy knows that just as long as hes
on his feet he aint goin to get any sleep
nor no chow

  i sure was in luck said hall i
got bumped about five minutes after we
hopped off

  huh said the leatherneck i was
in three days an didnt have nothin to eat
but some bread i swiped out of a dead
jerrys knapsack then i was forty-eight
hours before they got me after i was hit
stretcher-bearers couldnt get in man it
was hot in there why the night before

i got hit-

  he rambled on the way the marines
always did and his tale had much of admi-
ration in it for the soldiers of the sea

  hall smoked peacefully he belonged to
the first american division to land in france
the first to take a hostile gun the first to
do anything more than learn to throw
hand-grenades and kill bundles of branches
his regiment was the only one in the whole
american army that had not been broken
up to form new outfits it was old army
to the core marines ruffled him not

  what outfit you out of he asked the
third man on the bench

  im a truck-driver said this one with a
slight smile

  he was old and small of build and looked
a lot like the little man in the cartoons that
represents the common people

  huccum you got hit

  i didnt get hit i driv a truck clean
from epinal to chateauroux without gettin
off the seat then i got off to stretch my
legs and some sanguinary illegitimate on a
motorcycle come along an run over me
waddya do before yuh come in the
army

  this from the marine he saw a chance to
astonish this non-combatant

  i reckon i was cuttin my teeth said
the little man with a slight smile son
i been in this mans army since about the
time capn jack had his fight at the lava
beds that was fore your pappy an
mammy was born i started in bearin a
drum

  tell him somethin about the marines
suggested hall
pilgrims

  the marine favored him with a look and
announced he was going for a walk

  those birds got an idea theyre the
whole a e f said hall to the old-timer
naw said the truck-driver  taint
so the old-timers in the leathernecks is
all right i soldiered with em in the
islands an in china an most everywheres
else rookies is always shootin off their
mouths thataway specially if they aint
been in garrison for some time let em
keep a squad-room clean for three or four
months and wait till the other men have et
before they gets their chance and they soon
tames down you ever soldiered before
no said hall i used to drive a
grocery wagon in philly i had a row
with the boss one saturday night about
workin so late so i went an enlisted

  you hit bad

  no i aint i got a crack in the back
o the neck but it went through my mess-
kit and bacon-can and just knocked the
flesh off i only been here a week this
is my first day out o bed

  well youll be goin back pretty soon
wont you

  i will like- im tellin you i aint

never goin back i got outta that place
alive an i dont never crowd my luck
no sir every time i think o those shells
burstin and them machine guns rippin

i get complete total paralysis of the heart
you bet when that doctor examines me
im goin to have so many different things
the matter with me that itll take him all
day to write em down

  the old man grinned again

  id like fine for to get up myself i aim
to see how they do their killin nowdays
the two sat in silence after that then
hall rose and departed for his particular
hospital his stomach told him that it
approached time for mess he went on
down one of the paths watched some men
bowling on an open-air alley for a while
surprized a french chasseur cdpin kissing a
girl and then cut across the ball field to the
hotel continental where he lodged one
of the hospital orderlies hailed him in the
hall

  classification exam tomorrow soldier
said he your name is on the list
whats all this asked ira

  all the men in this ward that are out of
bed have to be examined to see what class
they belong in class a goes back to their

progress	

outfit class b gets a job guarding prison-
ers i dont know what happens to class
c but class d goes home

  ill be class d said hall emphatically
the following day the doctor took his
place at a table in the hall those whose
fate hung upon his decision lined up along
the wall and went before him one by one
those waiting could hear all that was said
and could get some ideas for their own tales
of wo from listening to those of others the
doctor had a sergeant of the medical corps
for his assistant a package of cigarets for
the relieving of his nerves and a rubber
hammer with which he beat one on the
knees and occasionally on the head in a
playful manner calling attention to the
hollow sound a huge lumbering man
with a cane approached the table

  well said the medico whats the
matter with you

  my leg hurts sir every time i step on
it

  how long have you been here

  three months sir

  anything else the matter with you
oh yes sir my ears hurt me all the
time

  sort of burn do they and pains run
through them

  yes sir yes sir thats just the way
they feel

  the doctor turned to his assistant with a
bored air

  duty said he next man
doctor said the next im in bad
shape

  he told why for some ten minutes
the doctor inhaled his cigaret

  mark him duty  ordered he

  whats your complaint

  ive got trouble with my feet

  most of you birds have especially when
it comes time to go up on the lines again
whats the matter with them	

  they itch all the time

  well ive heard of itching palm but
never of itching feet lets have a look
at them

  the feet were inspected the inspectee
stood on his toes jumped up and down
on one foot and then the other and worked
himself into quite a froth he looked
hopefully at the doctor

  duty said the doc

  but look doctor i cant walk i-

  duty i said and duty youget youre
adventure

no sicker than i am havent i listened
to you gold-bricks tell your tale of wo for
eight months up to the front with
you and make way for some wounded
man

  about half a dozen more were disposed of
and then came iras turn in this mans
heart was a dull heaviness he had heard
better liars than he would ever be recount
injuries and ailments that would make a
patent-medicine advertisement blush what
hope had he with the brightness of
the sun through clouds an idea came

  well said the judge of life and death
whats the matter with you

  nothin said hall

  the doctor and his assistant gasped
  nothing lets see his card

  they consulted the card together the
card that is put on a man in the field hos-
pital and stays with him until he dies or
leaves the base hospital for the replace-
ment camp on it is the whole history of
his case there was nothing there save
the routine history of a gunshot wound

  it says here you were shot

  oh thats all right said ira that
wasnt anything just a scratch

  he smiled benignly upon the medico
  well what do you want to do now

  i want to go back to the front

  by - yelled the doctor this

man is insane take him over to twenty-
three for observation the states for him
and the wild hugs that hall gave himself
and his merry chuckles on the way to the
psychopathic hospital only confirmed the
impression that he was raving mad

a wide plain flat as a table-top
stretching into the darkness on
either side acres and acres of
twinkling fights and the coughing of in-
numerable steam engines whistles and
the clanging of bells a little group of
soldiers clustering together for protection
and mutual reassurance in front of a large
hut this was the regulating station and
intermediate storage depot at is-sur-tille
and the soldiers were some who had arrived
that evening from various hospitals and
were waiting for a guide to lead them out
through the maze of railroad tracks to
their quarters

  among them his bones filled with weari-
ness and his heart with disgust but with
his stomach full of nothing was one ira

hall he and three more had traveled
all day from vittel riding gloriously in a
third-class carriage and they had had
nothing to eat since breakfast

  come on gang called the guide
emerging suddenly from the hut

  he led the way down the road and then
struck off across the plain the men
followed a mournful-looking company the
little gingham bag that was their only
baggage hanging from each shoulder

  god bless the women that made those
little bags about six inches square they
were and in them were all the earthly
possessions of their owners when a man
was first admitted to the hospital he was
given one of these bags known as red
cross bags because of the tiny red cross
sewed on the side in each was a little
bag of candy a pack of cards perhaps
sometimes a mirror gradually by fair
means or otherwise would be added a tooth-
brush and a razor

  the main thing though was that the
soldier had something he could call his
own somewhere to put what few treasures
he had and this little piece of gingham
was all that he could call his own from the
time he reached the hospital until he went
to the replacement camp to be fitted out
to go back to the front again

   suddenly a shaft of light shot across the
dark path a door from one of the near-
by buildings had been opened the men
stopped aghast the building was brightly
lighted and was full of women

  how come how come said they
in amaze they perceived that this bar-
racks was surrounded by a high fence of
barbed wire a voice came to them from
the darkness

  move your feet guys move your feet
yuh aint allowed to hang around here
speculation was rife as the soldiers
moved on

  what are them women doin in the
middle of a yank storage depot

  theyre women was caught fightin
dressed up like men i bet

  i betcha theyre spies i read a book
about women spies the german army
is full ofem

  finally the guide turned in a superior
manner

  them are french refugees he said
they work in the buildings and in the
rest camp that fence around there is to
pilgrims progress



keep you guys away they got marines
guardin it too

  that wouldnt be a bad job said ira
reflectively

  the guard laughed

  wait till you see some of em theyd
scare the cooties off an algerian

  hall and his companions stumbled on
in the very heart of a gridiron of railroad
tracks in the midst of the crash and bang
of shunting cars were seven or eight huts
and into one of these they were led dirt
floor and a line of double-deck wooden
bunks on each side there on the first
bunk was costello who will be remembered
as the man who sat beside hall while they
waited for the signal to jump off the
two fell on each others necks

  where yuh been asked hall

  the tube on my mask got shot away
said costello and i got full o gas i got
in this morning from dijon

  how did yuh like hospital

  well it was all right the first two or
three days while i was still in bed but after
they got me up i had to do settin-up exer-
cises and run around the block and play
ogrady by the time i did arms side-
ward swing and palms open an shut from
eight in the morning till four in the after-
noon with an hour off for dinner i was
wishin id got a bullet through me they
let on it was to get the gas outta our lungs
yeh i know i know they had me in
the nut ward for a while but the main guy
couldnt find nothin wrong with me so
they give me the raz they had me doin
cooks police for a week or so

  any o you birds just cofne in want
anything to eat better go over to the mess-
shack an get it

  thus a man who shoved his face in the
barracks door

  see yuh later said hall and hurried
forth

  the mess-shack was a building similar
to the hut used as a barracks it had two
tables down the center and two stoves at
the far end on which the cooking was done
a third table placed crosswise was used as a
counter and the pans containing food were
placed on it a female in a black dress
was serving there was goldfish-by which
name salmon was known to the american
soldiery-rice sirup coffee and bread

  the maiden in charge-whom we shall
call the waitress-might have been fair

had she possessed any front teeth she was
troubled also with a cold in her head
which necessitated frequent blowing of the
nose this being done in the good old-
fashioned way-that is to say with the
fingers the operation completed the
waitress would hurriedly begin to hand out
the bread again as if apologizing for having
kept some soldier waiting

 no one made any comment either
the men were too tired or else nothing
could dull the edge of their appetites
very probably it was the latter

  here are the different steps in the prog-
ress of a soldier from the time he leaves
the hospital until he returns to his organi-
zation the wounded man coming to the
base hospital in a suit of pajamas from the
field hospital or evacuation hospital was
clothed in a uniform that covered his naked-
ness and that was all that could be said
for it inasmuch as it had been taken from
some wounded man in the first place
sterilized and put back into service again
to this was due the scarecrow appearance
of casuals by the way a man was known
as a casual during his travels thus showing
one and all that he belonged to no organi-
zation had no friends and could be done
dirt by with impunity

  from the base hospital the casuals went
to a regulating-station-is-sur-tille or
saint dizier or some other place-and there
were sorted out into the different branches
of the service to which they belonged
from the regulating-stations they went to
those great reservoirs the replacement
camps each to his own there they were
given new clothes and fully equipped again
and started back to their organizations

  if a man was clever enough he could see
to it that he never left the replacement
camp and some there were that took this
method of keeping a whole skin these
last were not many and the reason there-
for shall presently appear

  in the morning hall and costelo strolled
out to view the sights there were miles
and miles of red wooden buildings in which
were stored all the necessary tools for the
carrying on of war there were acres of
railroad tracks and real american-style
freight-cars with american crews from the
railway engineers running around their
roofs to the great horror of die french

  hey look hall those are jerries

  true enough several hundred of them
ioo

 adventure

breaking rocks for the new road guarded
by a few bored-looking yanks most of
the prisoners still wore their gray uniforms
but some wore the american blouse or
breeches dyed a bright green and all the
laborers had pw in white letters painted
on them somewhere

  this is the nearest i ever was to so many
of them said costello looka that gray-
headed guy ira ill bet hes old enough
to be your grandfather

  theres some young ones there too
that kid with the yellow band on his cap
aint over fifteen or im a liar 

  the germans worked on stolidly pound-
ing the rocks with little hammers and break-
ing them up into the proper sizes for road-
building they paid no heed to the soldiers
that stopped and regarded them from time
to time they did not talk among them-
selves possibly from fear of divulging
some secret to the listeners it must indeed
have been a cheerless prospect to live behind
a barbed-wire stockade and break rocks for
two or three years

i wonder if they wish they was back
with their regiments again said costello
do you wish you was back with yours

  i do like - but i aint breakin

rocks all day nor bein penned up every
night

  i dunno said ira but what id
rather been taken prisoner then youd
be sure the war was over here its just
one thing after another i thought i was
all set to stay in vittel but they looked in
my ears and shined lights in my eyes and
allowed i was all right then they kicked

me the-outta there

  let us not judge hall too harshly who
does not know the exhausted irritable
feeling a man has after a night of broken
rest when he has lain safely on his own
bed let him who would judge our soldier
go without sleep not one night but two and
three or more let him take no food
during that time then let him see with
how much joy he welcomes the putting
of his life in peril

  such a test is not really fair to the sol-
dier he who simply goes without food
or sleep for a few days escapes the additional
strain of the sight of his friends not cleanly
dead but shattered and torn like a fly
killed with a newspaper he will escape
the sudden barrage the steam-roller that
rolls and rolls and beats everything to earth

he will escape the mad buzzing the shriek-
ing of the strombos the wild hammering
of machine guns and the brain-rocking
crash of bombs and all the terror and con-
fusion of the air raid he will not know
the silent raiders of the night that creep
into a trench and slit throats of sleeping
men leaving their bodies to be discovered
in the chill of the dawn when the garrison
turns out for stand to and their courage
is at its lowest one that has safely
come forth from this is not to be blamed
in that he yearns not to return

on the morning of the third day
hall costello and three other men
with a corporal named mcgubbin
were handed an order to proceed to the in-
fantry replacement camp at saint agnain
near paris it was inevitable that  this
camp should be known to the army as
saint agony their train would not go
until evening so that they had all day to
make preparations these consisted of
borrowing some matches and drawing
rations for the trip-some canned tomatoes
canned hash and canned beans one
could always tell a route that carried many
troops by the amount of tin cans along the
track these men had no packs so the
chow was put in a wooden box and the
travelers set off for the station a good two
hours before the scheduled departure of
the train

  the six of them waited patiently under
the dim lights of the gare the train was
always late the police informed them mc-
gubbin and costello kept charge of the
box of chow

  what kind of a train is it asked hall
the american special they call it
said the mp it just carries troops
and the crew are all americans it makes
good time they say you guys are lucky
you dont have to ride on a frog train

  ill say replied ira fervently i
rode down on one from vittel an believe
me i had a fine ride we went almost
four miles an hour on the straightaway
stretches

   the crowd grew larger

  are these guys all goin away

  sure some of em are from the rest
camp some of em are convoy men goin
back to the base ports maybe theres
some students goin to saumur or gondre-
court lookit now im tellin you kinda
pilgrims progress



friendly-like that when that train comes
in you just get on an dont go lookin for
a good seat nor dont wait for any one else
its goin to be kinda crowded

  the mp nodded sagely to give emphasis
to his remarks

  there was a long whistle the dazzle of
a headlight and the train rolled in a long
line of sleepers or wagons-lits hall essayed
to board one

  nix said the mp those are for
officers yours are back farther

  ira hurried to the rear of the train he
and costello carrying the box while the
corporal ran ahead to find an empty com-
partment sounds of strife arose what
looked like a young riot was in progress
it appeared that those on the train re-
fused to open the doors asserting that
there was no room for any more therein
those without denied this and tore at the
handles and beat at those at the windows
with their fists

  therewas the sound of splintering wood
here and there a door was wrenched open
and men shot out like seeds from a squeezed
orange others were torn bodily from
within the cars

  one poor man held on to the door-jamb
and howled lustily the while another tried
to drag him forth by the slack of his cloth-
ing the waist-beltof his breeches gave way
and the situation became embarrassing

  the man hanging to the car raised his
voice and howled for assistance his
friends held on to him with vigor those
on the platform seeing his plight hastened
to add their assistance to drag him forth

  a ripping sound and he was free the
remnants of his clothing were waved an
instant in the air and then lost sight of
he must have had a fine time when he
arrived at where he was going

  trooper said a voice in his ear

  a door opened almost in front of hall
and without hesitation he climbed into the
compartment he had lost both costello
and the chow-box early in the fracas

  shut that - door cried a dozen

voices and two men promptly tried to
close it

  too late fifty pairs of hands had
seized it and twenty-five men did their
best to squeeze through the narrow open-
ing blood was drawn here from noses
and knuckles were skinned on teeth

  the police arrived in swarms their clubs

swinging freely men were hurled into
compartments with the force of shells
others were pushed in by main strength
somehow somewhere that crowd was
wedged into the train and the cars began
to move the windows were thronged
with men exchanging compliments with the
military police

  hall wriggled a bit and looked to see if
there was any place to sit down he
tried to move a little to one side to get
relief from the intolerable pressure but he
was unable to change his position by so
much as an inch

  a french third-class carriage is divided
into compartments running across from
side to side with a door at either side
there are two seats that face each other
with room for four people on each seat
over these seats is a baggage-rack

  there was a dim light from a small bulb
in the ceiling and all that hall could see
were overseas caps tossing and wagging
with the motion of the train

  well thought he that means all
night and all the next day standin up in
the car an people at home kick if they
ride in a street-car and stand up for a
couple of blocks

  the train stopped again after a time and
mps appeared and announced that more
passengers must be got aboard there
were not as many as at is-sur-tille and
the delay was not so great the train
started again with a few more clubbed
heads and several new passengers

  at the next stop there was no getting
another man on that train club as they
might and even draw their guns the
police could not wedge another man into
those compartments

  a very haughty sergeant tried to make a
personal inspection of a car he was helped
in by welcoming hands-how they made
room for him was a mystery-and shortly
bleats of protest rent the air

  the sergeant was hurled forth minus
gun club and most of his clothing his
flying body struck some would-be rescuers
and bore them to earth as the train
moved on a man who wore about bis brow
the poor sergeants brassard leaned from a
window

  who won the war cried he and blew
a kiss to the enraged mps

  at one station two men appeared bearing
between them one far gone in liquor they


adventure

had a worried look about them as of men
who had been saddled with some hopeless
task opposite halls compartment they
let their burden fall to the ground and de-
clared loudly that there was no room on
the train an officer appeared bearing
a lantern

  get me a bucket of water cried he

  it was brought

  now pick up that man by the heels

  here he whispered into the ears of his
helpers

 now one

  -the men started to swing the helpless
drunkard

  two

  the swings grew wider

  three

  the man with the bucket sloughed the
water in on the men in the compartment
who promptly ducked leaving the window
free and at once the bibulous one was
hurled in upon their heads howls of rage
arose the men in the compartment were
packed so close that they could not give
way and let the new passenger fall to the
floor and he was no burden to be borne
on the heads and shoulders all night

  put him in the baggage rack

  yeh put him in the rack up with
him now

  the drunken soldier was seized and lifted
into the rack by willing hands hall
jammed his legs in with vigor one of
those hobnailed shoes had made unpleasant
contact with iras nose

  after that hall had a little time to medi-
tate on his position he was due to spend
all night and the next day on his feet
he had no food and there was none in
sight he had no orders since mcgubbin
being a corporal had retained their only
copy

  now this was serious a man who had
no authority for his travel would be seized
by the first apm that discovered it and
put to work lugging rails or unloading cars
or at some other congenial form of labor

  the man in the baggage rack showed
signs of becoming violently ill he was
hurriedly seized and dragged from his
refuge then passed from hand to hand or
rather head to head until he reached the
window hall who was near the door
had a bright thought which he proceeded
to put into execution he was very
solicitous of the comfort of the unfortunate

one holding his head undoing his blouse
and so forth

  dump that bird out the window said
some one

  the train was slowing down for another
station and the suggestion was carried
out

  a drunk never gets hurt said one of
the men

  in the light of an arc light shining into
the compartment hall eagerly read the
folded paper he had removed from the
inebriated ones left-hand upper pocket
sure enough it was a travel order properly
stamped ordering the bearer one pvt
duffin th regiment of artillery to
report to the commanding officer farr
le corneau gironde

  stiff red-eyed and dirty-faced the men
crawled out of the train at tours they
stood in line at the assistant provost mar-
shals desk and had their orders stamped
and then were told to go outside and fall in
and they would be taken to chow

  how far is it asked ira

  up to the caserne lafayette about four
miles said a sergeant of police

  four miles i cant walk four miles
i been standin up in that train all today
an the night before

  you dont need to go if you dont want
to said the sergeant kindly you can
wait here in the station

  where do i go from here

  lets see your orders

  he perused the slip rapidly

  huh farr thats near bor-
deaux two oclock you get a train for
bordeaux leaves from saint pierre des
corps

 two oclock what the- have

i got to lose another nights sleep thats
a-of a system

  lookit trooper a guy named john j
pershing is runnin the aef i aint
you can get outta here at two gm or stay
all night in the mill i dont care im
only tellin you

  hall went out and took his place in the
waiting line shortly they were marched
to the other end of the city and fed

  after supper hall went to the main gate
of the caserne and inquired of the sergeant
of the guard what he should do

  git a gate pass in that office there an
go out an look the town over you might
as well be outside as stickin around here
pilgrims progress



 whats farr mean asked ira

  search me said the sergeant foul
air an rotten rations for a guess

  he spoke truer than he knew

  the gate pass was secifted and ira went
forth into the dusk he set off in the
general direction of the depot and after
diving down one dark street and up another
and making many side excursions down
mysterious alleys he arrived in what seemed
to be the center of things

  lights streamed from cafe doors and
one could catch glimpses of white tables
sparkling glassware brightly clothed wo-
men and glittering officers of all armies
russians there were french british polish
belgian and of course american the
sidewalks were thronged with them

  hall became acutely conscious of the
fact that his blouse was old and several
sizes too small that his breeches had been
made for some one larger than he and that
the patches on the knees thereof were of
a different color from the rest of the gar-
ment he knew that his puttees were mere
strips of rag and that his hair needed cut-
ting here was no place for any buck
private

  he crossed the street and went by in the
shadow of the trees he felt no bitterness
that others should carouse and soak
themselves in wine while he and his fellows
suffered the tortures of hell perhaps
those officers were on leave from the front
and were enjoying life while they might
if hall had had some decent clothes and a
months pay in his pocket he would have
been in the very center of the very brightest
of all jthose bright places a girl on each
knee and one around his neck alas he
was bound to the only mast that would keep
him from the sirens of france he had not
been paid for four months

on the shores of the bay of
biscay south of bordeaux is
a desolate tract of sandy country
with dense forests of pine toward the coast
this section is known as the landes and
has been the subject of many a gloomy tale
no one lives there but a few shepherds and
gatherers of pitch a tiny railroad runs
from la teste de boucque to caseaux and
this is the only means of transportation

  one of the stations is called le corneau
and here the french established a training-
camp for the senegalese or negro battalions

where there would be no friction with white
inhabitants and where there would be no
chance for desertion when the senegal-
ese had all been trained and taken up to
the front and killed off the camp lay
empty until it was turned over to the
americans who established a replacement
camp for the field and railroad artillery
there

  this camp was in a state of filth and di-
lapidation that defies description the
americans whitewashed the portable huts
that served as barracks sprinkled a little
chlorid of lime around and declared them-
selves ready it was a terrible place but
when two millions of men must be tucked
away somewhere in a tiny country one-
half of which is in the hands of the enemy
and the other crowded with the armies of
the entire world it stands to reason that
the last comers are going to have to take
what is left people who go late to a show
should not object to poor seats

  to this cheery place came hall a days
journey from bordeaux he climbed weari-
ly from the little rattling train that had
brought him from la teste and surveyed
the camp

  so this is the f a r r ill get mine
when they find out im a doughboy

  he turned in his orders at the head-
quarters not forgetting that his name was
no longer hall but duffin and was turned
over to the supply company for rations
that being the organization that received
all casuals two blankets he drew a shel-
ter half a pack a mess-kit a bacon and
condiment can-who ever carried bacon
or condiments in them-a pistol-belt a
pole and some tent-pegs these last he
conveniently dropped between the supply
room and the barracks

  four thirty pm chow in an hour the
men in the barracks were playing cards
smoking reading and lying just as any
other crowd of idle males would

  what outfit you out of asked the man
on the opposite bunk

  sixteenth infantry said hall

  infantry waddya doin in this camp

  hall explained

  i can get by i guess unless they set me
to workin round one o those seventy-
fives

  well said the other man ill tell
yuh i been here a week names knox
im outta the seventh field theyre


adventure

heavies you know but anything thats
artillery conies to this camp just the same
theres two old seventy-fives here to train
two thousand men with so you wont get
blisters takin a breech-block apart

  an then another thing you said
that duffin guy was from the fifty-fifth
thats a railroad outfit you can claim
you dont savvy nothin but fourteen-inch
but whatll you do when they send you up
to the front again theyll know when
yuh get to the fifty-fifth that you aint
duffin

  listen knox i aint never goin up to
no front again i know when im well
off i been draggin myself all over france
these last two or three days with nothin
to eat and standin up in trains all night
and fightin with the police an i crave a
little rest an right here is where i get
said rest right here when im rested
enough to go back to the front again the
wars goin to be over

  you an me both said knox fervently
but somehow this place dont fit in with
the dreams ive had o the place i was goin
to rest in gee its time for first call i
better go wash

  he snaked a tin basin from under the
bunk and departed

  how do they eat here asked hall of the
man in the bunk above him

  well said the other it isnt so bad
when you can get any of it you know
there are about six hundred men in the
supply company and more come in every
day they have a great system the
gang from each barracks lines up in front
of its building and then they march over
in turn to the mess-shack anyway thats
the theory

  waddya mean theory

  you wait buddy and youll see for
yourself

   knox rushed in just as retreat blew and
tossed his towel on a nail and the two
hustled out hall gasped men were
pouring from barracks like water from an
overturned jug he hadnt thought that
there were so many in the whole camp

  where do all these birds keep them-
selves knox

  huh each one has got a place of his
own they lie doggo during the day but
every one comes to retreat because then
they read off the names of the men that
are to go away

  a man with the chevrons of a first
sergeant began to blow on his whistle
and continued to do so until he was quite
black in the face then by way of change
he shrieked attention several times at
the top of his lungs and then fell to on the
whistle again

  the six hundred conversed affably with
each other they were lined up three
ranks deep and their front covered more
than a hundred yards at the far end of
the line some twenty-five or thirty reclined
at ease on the ground the company be-
gan to shuffle its feet and at once a thick
heavy cloud of dust rose from the sand
blackened with ashes of four years fires
the top kick still called like a lost soul in
that black cloud

  at once it came upon the six hundred
that he was reading a list of names silence
fell with a suddenness that hurt

  the first sergeant read rapidly paying
no attention to the shouted heres nor
to the silence that followed the calling of
some of the names conversation gradu-
ally started again and men began coolly to
leave the ranks and go into the huts

  that aint no list they said hes
callin the roll

  how do they know asked hall

  if he reads off the names fast like that
and non-coms and bucks all together hes
just calling the roll but if he reads em
slowly with a bunch of sergeants and cor-
porals first its an order and those men are
going away you can easily tell the dif-
ference after youve heard a few

  aint the band goin to play the star-
spangled banner

  i dont know i never heard it retreat
doesnt mean anything here how are you
going to get any order with a bunch of
indians like that

 my- said hall what kind of a

madhouse have i got into yuhd think
they was a bunch of bolsheviks

  mess was immediately after retreat and
the men equipped themselves with their
mess-kits and fell in again this time
there were not so many in fact there were
surprizingly few in front of one hut which
by the way was the one scheduled to march
to the mess-shack last

  some of the jaw-bone n-cos took their
places between the huts and gave the
commands for marching there was some
jeering at this and subdued laughter as
pilgrims progress



of men having a private joke up their
sleeve the jaw-bones lacking experi-
ence got one of the squads turned upon
itself so that no one knew where he was
supposed to go and had no knowledge of
what his neighbor did save that he was
walking up the back of his neck and what
with the rage at being ordered about by a
john and the knowledge that the other
squads were getting ahead of them in the
chow line and a general disgust at all the
world in general and le comeau in particu-
lar these poor convalescents were well-
nigh beside themselves with rage

  to - with right face an left face

im goin  said one and he went

  the squad started to the chow line by the
most direct line

  hey git outta there we come ahead
of you guys

  get back into ranks

  squad halt

  this last brought a ringing cheer the
next squad quickened their step and then
broke into a slow trot a roar went up
from five hundred throats and all and
severally the men of the supply company
broke their formation and made for the
cook-shack at a dead run

  here their shouts took on a different
tone some hundred men were standing
in line there and these prepared to defend
their position to the death the battle
became general

  hall stood aloof for a moment and then
made his decision it mattered not to him
who stood first in line nor how many men
would be ahead of him at a table in front
of the shack stood two grinning cooks
police ready to serve out the bacon and
bread they were enjoying the spectacle
of the fight much as keepers would a row
among their charges in a zoo

  hall scooped up a mess-kit full of bacon
seized a handful of bread and then fled
but he had been seen the six hundred
straightway stopped their struggle for
places in the line and bore down upon the
food two men seized the boiler full of
bread and started off a third leaped into it
with both feet tearing it from their hands
and then the three were buried under an
avalanche of grabbing hands and stamping
feet the table crashed to earth in ruin

  a lieutenant and the first sergeant
rushed from the orderly room blowing their
whistles the top went straightway to

the cans of hot water bubbling over a fire-
pit dug in the ground in preparation for
the washing of many mess-kits and cast
buckets of this boiling water all about upon
the struggling men many of them retired
to the mess shack and continued the battle
there to the accompaniment of crashing
pans and the bulging of the buildings walls

  the officer smote the first man he came
to upon the jaw wafting him against the
coffee urn which promptly overset and
well-nigh drowned the bold top this last
fled shrieking with his shirt and breeches
full of hot coffee

  the turmoil of battle carried to the
guard-house

  turn out gang called the od
theres another mess-shack fight at the
supply company

  the guard trotted across the parade
but when they reached the scene there was
no one in sight and the fragments of that
supper would not feed a healthy airedale

  some time later the lieutenant went
down the line of huts and thus delivered
himself-

  those men who did not take part in the
riot and who got no supper may fall in
and be marched to the second companys
mess-shack

  he repeated this at each hut verily
he was a trusting young man and one not
mindful of the evil of the world when he
reached the last barrack he turned around
there were some six hundred men lined
up behind him

cold dawn with a freezing mist
the high thin wail of first call then
in a little time the faint strains of
the band over by the guard-house playing
therell be a hot time in the old town
tonight now this is a marine song so
the chances were that the leader was some
old leatherneck

  whistles began to shriek in an outfit
where there are many new non-commis-
sioned officers there is always a great
clamor of whistles just before assembly
hall was not used to them they made
him nervous in his company they were
rarely used and then only by the officers
the first sergeant had no use for one being
blessed with a voice that would shake a
bird from the limb of a tree

  huccum all this tootin said ira as
he struggled into his blouse
io

adventure

  dont mean nothin said the man in
the next bunk no formation-only for
the replacements leastways theyre the
only ones that go

  waddye get up for

  no breakfast if yuh stay in bed better
beat it an get in line or youll lose another
meal

  this time there was no pretense of form-
ing to be marched over every one went
at his best speed and got as near the head
of the line as he could the head was a
doubly desirable place since those who were
fed first could dash around to the end of the
line and be in time for a second mess-kit
full before the chow was all gone this
was possible for only a few

   it was bitter cold ira secured two slices
of bacon some fried potatoes a little karo
a slice of bfead and tin cup full of coffee
and then retired to the side of the fire that
was burning under the water-cans in prep-
aration for the washing of the mess-kits
it was beautifully warm there and he put his
breakfast on the sand and crouched over
it in happy anticipation a huge foot
went by and scattered a film of black dust
over the contents of the meat-can

  you poor tripe said hall keep
those big mud-scows of yours out of my
mess-kit

  fry your ear said the culprit go
an eat somewhere else if you dont like it
ira arose and looked lie other between
the eyes but he kept his mess-kit in his
hand while he did it the man with the
big feet went on without further parley and
hall returned to his breakfast the hot
coffee and the warm food felt good in the
poor mans inside and did fair to raise his
body temperature to normal the sun
was not yet up and the mist clung thickly

  suddenly from the fog came a sharp
voice-

  get your - - feet out of my

mess-kit

 get your--mess-kit out from

under my feet then

  ill show you you-

  the sound of running feet then the
first voice again boastingly 

  hed better run id broke every
bone in his body kickin sand all over
my bacon

  a pause then the same voice complain-
ingly with just a hint of apprehension-
whered my bacon go

  the sound of snickering like the rat-
tling of paper a gruff heavy taunting
voice-

  never mind the bacon eat your break-
fast

  i kinda thought that was the game
said hall to himself pick a fight with a
guy and then some one else swipes his
chow huh

  when first call for drill blew ira looked
about him for knox but he was nowhere
to be seen nor were any of the other men
in evidence the infantryman was in
doubt whether to attend drill or not but
there was no one to advise him and the
habit of discipline was strong upon him
he guessed hed better go he won-
dered how the six hundred would behave
at drill

  poor hall when he took his place in
ranks he gazed about him with wondering
eyes there were not enough men there
to make more than three healthy squads
they were armed with rifles which cheered
him somewhat as he had feared that there
would be maneuvers with a field-gun a piece
of apparatus that he knew nothing about

  wheres all the gang he asked the
man next to him

  they dont ever stand drill was the
reply only us poor guys that belong to
the replacement draft have to they
give us the manual of arms and squads
right and left and then the loot asks us
questions about the parts of the field-gun
and who takes off the breech cover at the

command prepare for action a --

of a lot of good that will do us when we
get up to the front

  ill say said hall

  the men were fallen in and marched
toward the drill-ground but when they
had gone but a few paces a complication
arose a major with a bull-like voice
halted them

  what organization is this he asked
the lieutenant

  supply company sir

  supply company supply squad you
had six hundred and thirty-five men on the
morning report dont deny it i saw
it myself there arent more than thirty
here where are the others speak up
now where are they

  they must be on detail somewhere sir
i leave that to the first sergeant these
are all the men available for drill
pilgrims progress



  the poorlieutenant began to perspire
slightly

 detail - roared the major

theyre all in these barracks i know they
are go into that one and dig them out-
at once now turn em out for drill whats
the army coming to

  the lieutenant walked toward the nearest
hut perhaps in order to make clear what
follows it would be well to give a descrip-
tion of the buildings of which le corneau
was composed these huts were invented
by the same man that invented the tin
hat and were put up in sections there
was a door at both ends at about the
height of a mans chest from the floor the
wall flared outward making a storage
space some three feet deep the hut had
the appearance of a common wall tent
save that it was made of wood and the
space where the guy ropes would be was
covered over making the flare described
above it was the custom to hang slickers
overcoats packs and all the odds and ends
of equipment from the wall just above
the flare so that they hung down and cur-
tained off the space in back of them let
us now proceed

  when the officer was several paces from
the door there came a sound of scrambling
then men poured from the farther door
in a stream the majors wattles grew
crimson and he bellowed melodiously

  the watching men shook with delight
the longer this kept on the less time would
be left for drill

  the lieutenant entered the door all un-
aware that the bird had flown the hut
was empty he returned to the major happy
in that his story had been vindicated

  sir said he there was no one in the
barrack

  who is he that hath said profanity
springs from a lack of vocabulary not
so the squad listened while the major
went from the burning blazing heat of the
suns innermost depths to the stark cold of
interstellar space from the high heights
of heaven to the blackest foulest pit of
irretrievable perdition he spoke feelingly
of the lieutenants ancestors his immediate
family and descendants he gave his
views of the army the war g h q and
the commissioned personnel of the field
artillery replacement reserve pinwheels
flashed rockets soared and burst and dia-
monds glittered in his speech

  the listening soldiers treasured every
word happy laughing faces were at the
windows of all the huts

  now said the major come with me
and i will show you how to turn out these
everlastingly condemned gold-bricks

  he selected two of the huskiest of the
jaw-bone non-coms and had them take
position at the farther doors of the barracks
then the two officers moved toward the
door of the nearest building the faces
disappeared from the windows the non-
coms at the farther door were seen to take
the position of charge bayonet and con-
fused sounds were heard

  the officers entered silence they re-
appeared at the other door the majors
words could be heard distinctly even at a
distance of a rilile or so

  in the name of all that is blue and
green and red what did you let those men
out for

  the two jaw-bones executed rifle salute
as prescribed

    sir no one came out

  the major went back into the building
the signs of recent occupancy were numer-
ous there were the hands of a game of
black-jack lying face down on one of
the bunks smoldering cigarets on the
floor a pipe with a thread of smoke rising
from the bowl a complete outfit of
clothing for one man lay across a bunk

  some one said the major will be
badly sunburned before he gets back

  the two officers repeated their inspection
at the next hut with the same result they
went to every barracks in the line and then
came sadly back to the waiting squad

  well well lieutenant said the senior
officer dont bother me with your
troubles i have too much to do to be
chasing soldiers all the morning i cant
help it if you cant get your men out to
drill there now take what few you have
and run along with them they are all
you can handle i dare say

  and he departed on his way the
lieutenant sadly marched the squad to the
drill-ground for the forty minutes that
remained of the drill period the men
felt sorry for him

  saturday thank- said knox after

mess and no drill to duck this afternoon
where was all that gang when the
major went in the barracks this morning
asked hall
io

adventure

  in the dugouts

  dugouts

  sure back o the slickers and stuff on
the wall the looeyll get wise to it some
day though and then well have to hunt a
new place

  it appears to me said ira that this
camp is a bum place to rest

  its better than duckin shells anyway
replied knox

 turn out to draw bull durham
called a voice outside the next barracks

  hall made a wild dash for the door and
then stopped clearly something was
wrong here some of the men reconnoi-
tered the adjoining hut through the win-
dows others went into seclusion behind
the slickers without delay no one seemed
anxious to receive any tobacco

  whats cornin off here muttered hall

  dont never turn out for any call like
that said a soldier unless you see
somebody right there with a cartoon of
bull

 hall looked out the window sure
enough there was one of the jaw-bones
with a big pasteboard box under his arm

  come on out guys was the uni-
versal cry its a sure-enough tobacco
issue

  the barracks was rapidly emptied knox
and one or two more remained

  you stay in here said knox seizing
hall by the coat i smell somethin

wrong now dont be a-fool stick

around they dont give nothin away in
this place without a string to it especially
on saturday afternoon

  aw whats eatin yuh cried ira
aint the guy out there issuin it out

  come here said a man at the window
can you imagine this

  there was a line of eager soldiers in
front of the next hut a man with a big
box full of bull durham and a lieutenant
who gave a sharp command as hall reached
the window the waiting line snapped to
attention

  left face said the looey forward
hart

  the men marched off out of sight
the man with the tobacco turned and went
the other way with never so much as a
glance at the disappearing men

  i thought it was some gag like that
said one of the watchers at the window
theyll go down to the tracks and unload

cars all the afternoon and all the bull
theyll get will be what that officer throws
while theyre workin

     a week passed how simple a
fw thing it is to write thus in that
week hall went through tortures
that he never knew existed each day the
selfsame fight for food he stole from
other mess-kits and had his own stolen
he fought for his place in the line only to
find when the fight was over that the chow
was all gone

  the hiding-place behind the slickers was
discovered and hall found a new one in
the pine woods across the railroad tracks
he was dragged forth from this one by the
police and spent a hot day on the rock-pile
regretting it

  he had forgotten to answer to the name
of duffin at roll-call and hence found that
he was being carried as absent without
leave this meant that he would never
be sent away because his name would never
be put on an order the only thing to do
would be to announce that he had returned
and stand trial for being away the better
part of a week indeed he was upon the
horns of a dilemma and had both of them
skewered clear through him

  i had a new dodge today said knox
one evening as they were discussing their
wos i had a box i carried around with
me all day i didnt go out an hide i
just stuck around the camp every time
an officer or an m p came near id pick
up the box and walk off with it like i was
carryin it somewhere then just about
half an hour before recall some wise bird
halts me an asks where im goin with
the box

   im goin to the supply company with
it says i

   how come theres nothin in it
says he

   firewood says i

   well you be- sure you get it to

the supply company right priesa says he
i see you carryin it four times already an
its the same box cause i remember the
tomato label on it 

  hows the chances on goin over the
hill said ira casually

  nothin doin dyuh know what keep-
in yuh here theres the regular camp
guard-just guys like us you know then
theres the provosts sergeants gang from
pilgrims progress



the f a r r ail mounted an one behind
every bush-

   ill say agreed ira

  then on the road is the regular police
the sixth cavalry mounted an dis-
mounted all the way between here an
bordeaux an each town has its own special
police a frog gendarme aint above pickin
you up either

  i know a good chance to get out
said a man on an upper bunk theyre
goin down to the spanish border tomorrow
to get horses an a detail is goin along
theyre goin to take their lunch an every-
thing

  how do you know demanded hall

  i heard the top kick talkin about it

  lets go said hall

  nix answered knox its a stall

  im goin to look into it anyway i
crave to get out of this hole even for a
day

  the next morning it appeared that the
rumor was true the cooks police were
busy making up sandwiches and the supply
sergeant had a huge pile of halter shanks
in front of his door excitement was
high even the worst drill-dodgers in
the company besought the top to be al-
lowed to go-all save knox who remained
aloof

  i dont trust em said he

  after breakfast two halter shanks were
issued to every one that applied it would
have been obvious to a disinterested party
that if those men were really going some-
where in trucks it would require a con-
siderable train to transport them it
would also be noticed that nothing had
been announced officially regarding their
destination the first sergeant had started
the rumor and had allowed it to take its
course knowing that it would run like a

prairie fire the men were fallen in and
marched away

t was close to nightfall when
the canoe crossed the last lagoon
and entered a swift river man-
grove-banked with the current
making curious sucking noises among the
stilted roots-like chuckling mud monsters
the naked natives paddled hard sweat
beading on their dark skins while their
eyes rolled strangely beneath their frizzly
hair fantastically bleached with lime to
the semblance of yellow and orange dust
mops

  presently the mangroves gave way to
the bush tall trees festooned by lianas
wattled with jungle undergrowth the
lowering sun bloodied the drips from the
paddle blades painted crimson the ragged
crests of the mountains looming dark
savage distant the far-off throb of
drums came down the whispering wind that
went rustling mysteriously through the
gloomy forest

  benson lolled in the stern languid
affecting nonchalance as ever-posing-
imagining himself the leader of a band of
dusky slaves not quite easy in the re
but unable entirely to lose his theatrical
tendencies his love for playing a leading
part on his immediate stage

  his eyes were haunted like those of
harris in the bows like those of all the men
they were furtively going to join men

whose loud laughter was never extended to
their glance men who were anxious rather
than gay for all their swaggering masque-
rades

  benson knew the hunt was up implacable
persistent in the calamitous hurry of
discovery and departure he had not been
able to bring much money less than ten
thousand dollars of all those gathered from
his dupes barely two per cent of all his loot
flight with the knowledge of sure pursuit
had proved expensive and his funds were
low true he had spent had thrown away
most of that half a million dollars but there
had been another coup pending if he had
only had a little more time-

  his white linen was limp and grimy
from the heat and discomfort of the trip
from suva a good deal of the bravado
was out of benson and the look of the sullen
jungle in the sunset glare was not promising
mosquitoes buzzed and bit viciously in-
visible sand-flies were worse

  harris the cheap crook the absconding
traders agent who had told him of the
brotherhood was hunched up in the bows
foul of mind and body half-drunk swigging
at his flask of rum singing snatches of
ribald song

  strange company for benson after the
glitter of cafes the music the white smooth
shoulders of women the food the dance

no

hi

the wine the life for which he had bartered
his honor-his essential liberty he cursed
the woman who had given him away
his mood of make-believe vanished the
paddler facing him started at the sudden
ferocity of the white mans face

  round the next bend matey sang

  sounds good forced benson affecting
distasteful fellowship

  betcha life

  the bow-paddler suddenly jabbered in
fijian and harris answered him in the
dialect the canoe swung inshore against
the swirling current the drums boomed
out louder the barbaric compelling
rhythm seemed to benson to come simul-
taneously from everywhere-the bush the
sky the ground and the dark welling water
the ominous sinister measure dominated
his feverish pulse the boohing of conch-
shells like demon hooting came down the
river gorge he was sure he saw a dark
figure materialize for a moment against
the bush and then vanish like so much
vapor

  his vivid imagination pictured stark
savages careering about monstrous idols
while shaven-headed women shuffled in silent
files their pendulous breasts swinging time
peeled wands siftrnounted by grinning
skulls in their right hands flaring torches
in their left he wiped the perspiration
from his forehead as the canoe bumped
gently nosing into the matted bush

  - what a hole

  harris leaned forward

  cheerio ere we are matey chuck
out your luggage

  they were at the entrance of a dim and
narrow bush-path its floor trodden hard
by myriads of horny soles walled by the
impenetrable jungle it was here that
benson had seen the figure appear and
vanish the paddlers had been paid be-

forehand without a word they swiftly
turned the canoe the paddles ciattng
circles of troubled water that caught the red
of the overhead sky with a swiftly
increasing stroke they went racing down-
stream as if glad to leave the spot

  harris swung up a grimy duck bag to his
shoulder benson reduced to one piece
of baggage in this latest flight hesitated
to take up his grip

  ill swear i saw a man watching us just
now before we landed he said a
native listen to those cursed drums will

  sure give me the creeps when i

bo williams nappin matey ow ud
we be safe if e didnt set watch come on

  the bush hemmed them with barely
elbow room buttressed banyans bread-
fruit towering tutui scarlet geranium-
trees feathery-bamboo wild-citron inextri-
cably meshed with vines dense shrubbery
at their feet writhing creepers across the
trail there was no sound of birds only
the hum of innumerable insects jeweled
beetles metallic butterflies that flickered
in the twilight the foliage seemed black
under the fading after-glow of sulfur-
colored clouds floating on a sea of jade-
green that swiftly dimmed to olive then to
purple suddenly set with glowing stars-
like eyes

  out of the bush came the oppressive
odors of decaying fruit and too fragrant
flowers-a decadent perfume suggesting
death

the brotherhood had various
names bestowed upon it by the
various types of men that sought
its sanctuary it was a clearing house for
criminals a fourth dimension for fugi-
tives they entered its immunity-at a
price fixed by rumbo williams bawdy
prior of this mysterious monastery-and
disappeared sometimes an emissary of
the law a kilted half-caste of the native
policy arrived in desultory search found
nothing and departed bribe in hand

ex-convicts-some of them desperate fugi-
tives from dread noumea-runaway ships
apprentices pallid men men tanned by
wind and sun and sea men white yellow
brown and black of all ranks all runa-
ways coming from all parts of the world
for asylum for a chance to hide and be
forwarded by rumbos underground system
to still remoter places these the brethren

  the low-roofed house was hardly visible
as they broke out of the trail and crossed
a tract of breast-high ferns whose crushed
fronds gave out a faint smell of almonds
again a flitting form preceded them mate-
rializing and vanishing like a fantom no
lights showed

  the sounds they had heard while they
were in the fern ceased suddenly-the
whine of a violin the blare of an accordion
buffeting of feet on a dance floor and mens
coarse voices grating in careless chorus
only the distant drums persisted

  harris tapped a signal this was not his
first visit he boasted and he knew the
ropes a slide opened finally and the
sesame was passed there was the chink
of coin a door set wide and harris passed
in benson found himself confronted by
a man half a foot taller than himself his
long bearded face in the shadow his eyes
dark though benson felt their keen ap-
praisal

  its twenty quid a week pay in ad-
vance said a deep voice that was not
without an echo of quality of educated
intonation

  twenty protested benson harris
said-

  harris is a horse of another color my
friend i know a gent when i see one and i
know brains i dont know what your
lay was brother and i dont care but ill
warrant it paid well youre not a piker
a picaroon like most of our pals in here
and you pay accordingly-take it or leave
it

  benson gave him notes he had got in
sydney the noise had started again
his host escorted him through the main
room of the shanty where men sat elbowed
at a long low table some playing cards
some drinking moodily all turning hunted
eyes towards the door tallow candles
swung on wires suspended above the bar
and guttered on the table there were
chinese in the crowd malays mixed breeds
white men drumming with nervous fingers
to the music while their thoughts were
far from the cards spread out in canfield
before them a few rough customers
danced together two-more lucky-
dragged about half-white girls who screamed
with laughter as they repelled crude famili-
arities

  all sorts and conditions of men
said rumbo good fellows but-care-
less-let us say careless knit in common
interest in common safety a sort of
socialism effective despite apparent limi-
tations of caste because each depends upon
the other you can well understand that

  it pays to be liberal i should stand
a round occasionally if i were you get
their goodwill you can never tell when
you may need it

  here are the sleeping quarters com-
munism again but i insist upon cleanli-
ness and only white men sleep in this room
you can take either of these end bunks
quite pleasant with the window open
above mosquito nettings you see fresh
matting

  he had talked specifically to benson
harris as a former guest needed no en-
lightenment rumbo williams lowered
his voice

  i do not ask your confidence or your
name he said though you will re-
quire the latter call it smith glad to
have you stay here as long as you like
if you have decided where you are going
i will arrange the exit if not i might sug-
gest the marquesas now if it were not
for the profits-im being frank with you-
id go there myself may yet golden

women with golden hearts who worship
a white man like a god and hide you in the
hills loving and not over jealous you
can have a dozen of em if you want
lotus land i can tell you are a womans
man sir all red-blooded men are im
one myself my failing

  benson wondered from what pinnacle
of respectability this keeper of an illicit
sanctuary had fallen when he became
careless closer inspection showed wil-
liams to have good features coarsened by
self-license eyes that were a strange com-
bination of being both bleary and keen a
prominent nose that advertised his title of
rumbo a physique marred by corpulence-
but powerful with it all an assumption
of fellow villainy that jarred on benson
who was not over sensitive

  i can get you in without registry mr
smith the french authorities will never
know youve landed once tucked away
youre safe forever unless things blow
over they do sometimes unless you hap-
pen to get in wrong with the federal
government-were both americans un-
cle samuel has an inconveniently long
memory

  benson dissembled easily enough he
was not going to give himself away to this
trafficker in carelessness

  quarters are fine he said ill talk
things over with you later expect ill
stay here for a few weeks

  rumbos eyes glowed with cupidity
benson knew that his was a slick villainy
that his veneer of friendliness would slide
like a dirt road surface after rain if friction
occurred it would cost money to get
away but it was worth it the marquesas
and its golden women that was an apt
phrase a man might do worse than live
in lotus land and thumb his nose at the
federal hounds

  he had been a fool to cross swords with
uncle sam to plan with an alien enemy
and conspire to prevent the shipment of
ammunition to the allies true he had
not been an actual traitor to his own he
had double-crossed the very men who had
paid him so liberally it was lucky the
allies had taken over the south seas
it would not do to fall into the hands of
those with whom he had bargained

  there had been other matters too
trust funds gold mines and oil wells

unfortunate investments for those who

   

had sought his advice all stirred up
when the woman had betrayed him still-
in the marquesas a little money went a long

way

  lets buy that round of drinks he

said

  there was a woman-a girl-posturing
at one end of the big room gracefully
voluptuous round of limb and firm of
breast chanting as she moved in a native
hula to the plucking of a banjo white
wild-ginger flowers were wreathed in her
hair and about her body above the swing-
ing skirt of grass and bark-paper not all
the men regarded her one looked at her
with eyes that showed hatred of her sex

  its kumi said harris aint she
a charmer a bit of all right she is
ave er up for a drink when she gets
through

  the whole room responded eagerly to
bensons shout clouted natives acted
as waiters to those who did not crowd to
the bar the pungent liquor warmed
bensons body mounted to his brain
loosened his emotions he shook off his
moodiness here was an audience and he
was first and last an actor a player to the
gallery desirous of applause

  with the same air-with something of
the same hypocrisy-with which he used
to lay a twenty-dollar bill upon the col-
lection plate at church in his home town
in massachusetts-where his wife and
child now lived as best they could-he
flourished his money bought them liquor
told them stories and sat smiling at their
loud guffaws

  they cheered him and sang him passing
fame as a jolly good fellow the room grew
thick with smoke the air carried fumes of
strong brews kumi came to his side and
stayed there while harris glowered ben-
son was master of the revel he began
to boast a little to hint more than his
reason warned him-against his glib tongue
-was wise he absorbed their admiration
swollen with conceit like a dry sponge
soaking water

  his eyes brightened and he complacently
stroked the mustache and trim beard he
had grown since he had read the newspaper
in the club at sydney that warned him to
move on he slid an arm about the gig-
gling kumi and harris red-eyed drunken
malevolent struck fiercely at him

  benson was not a coward and he was as
ii

adventure

physcially fit as the other harris fought
foul with foot and knee with fingers that
clawed for his opponents eyes and benson
fought him off half-blinded a pain in his
groin like a hot blade

  when his vision cleared harris was strug-
gling futilely in the grip of rumbo who
propelled him towards the door a two-
quid guest against a twenty-quid one
there was no question of the issue

  the men had formed a ring about them
musicians waiters and barman their eyes
eager for a fight already showing dis-
appointment as rumbo took charge

  out you go cried rumbo i dont
stand for that sort of thing my bucko got
drunk on his liquor and then turned on him
for nothing im running this shanty
women and all

  harris bloodied where bensons fist
had split his mouth his whole face crimson
with rage and mortification struggled
hard in the clutch of rumbo holding him
aloft calling for the offenders dunnage
prepared to cast him into outer darkness
and insecurity benson interfered his
brain cleared at the crisis he could not
afford to be enemies with any of his fellow
refugees let alone harris who knew more
than the rest

 hold on he said that was my
fault i didnt know she was his girl
if my drinks started the fuss let another
round end it

  rumbo regarded benson with eyes that
held a glint of approval of recognition of
the others sapience

  if thats the way you feel about it
he said ill call it off as a favor to you
but i dont stand for having my rules
broken

  he shook harris a little before he put
him down as a bull-terrier might shake a
rat harris stood glowering

  my fault harris repeated benson
i didnt mean to butt in well have
another drink round and forget it

  it was plain that harris ungracious
growl of acceptance was more expedient
than spontaneous but he shook hands with
his assailant though he did not look him in
the eyes he turned to the girl who had
stood by with her big eyes glowing her
breasts heaving in the feminine excitement
and satisfaction of being the core of a
quarrel

  she made a scornful moue at him

  what name you so rough a fella she
demanded as she eluded his uncertain
grasp i no like that kind

  benson carrying his liquor better than
most of them knew he had not properly
placated harris and he made it a point
to send the latter to his bunk in a condition
which he hoped would produce forgetful-
ness of the details of the quarrel though he
did not doubt that kumi would remind
harris of it if the agent again approached
her for favors now she showed herself at-
tracted by benson but self-preservation was
prime with him over his inclinations
pretty and voluptuous as she was he did
not intend to enter an intrigue that might
lead to dangerous reprisal from harris

  all that could wait until he met the
golden women of the marquesas in lotus
land

  benson didnt sleep much but lay in a
reverie in which he saw himself a petty
potentate petted and pampered by black-
eyed black-haired beauties secure from
pursuit a man might do worse

  there were none of those cursed drums in
the marquesas they were pacific islands
in the true sense lands of wild romantic
beauty of waving palms of streams and
waterfalls of flowers and universal verdure
life the love of life and the life of
love

  he knew something of rumbo williams
methods of speeding his departing guests
gleaned from harris an outrigger canoe
to nuka hiva a cabin aboard a discreet
trader a vanishing in the night costly-
in bensons case-but efficient

  of the victims of his various peculations
benson then as ever thought not at all
he had a faculty of dismissing them as in-
feriors unable to cope with his smartness
victims of their own credulity to be for-
gotten as the birds limed and netted by a
fowler man woman child widow or-
phan friend he eliminated them

  one thing remained with him against
his efforts the look in his wifes eyes
when she realised that he was not merely
rogue but traitor in vain he called her to
himself a canting hypocrite he had
hidden things from her because he had
wanted to maintain her respect if not her
love and the loss of it rankled far more
than the fact that she sat in ashes amid
the ruin of her respectability and that of
their child
nemesis



  benson was a very thorough-going black-
guard

  when he woke up it was well after dawn
the drums had ceased a radiant shaft
of sunshine came through the window above
his bunk he watched the little motes
dancing in the shining beam the golden
beam

  it might be well to stay with rumbo
long enough for ingratiation-at twenty
quid a week-then-emerald islands sap-
phire seas crags of gray-jade silver streams
and golden women-golden life-the old
world laughed at

      there are at least two types of
gseqjj detectives even those in govern-
ment employ the solver of mys-
teries attracted to the profession by a
flair for the unraveling of riddles the
man-hunter the bloodhound of the law

  the last is brave persistent patient
the other need not have the first of these
qualities

  jim griffin of the federal service was
the bloodhound of the law he had brains
bravery pertinacity a faculty for recogni-
tion for penetration of disguise an excel-
lent memory and an absolute conviction
that he was serving the ends of justice
the good of the community doing his duty
as a citizen when he took the trail

  from that moment he was a sworn foe
to the fugitive implacable not to be shaken
off taken off the official leash given full
liberty griffin had never failed to get his
man some of them dead but all of them
accounted for

  during the world war the criminal who
fled was of less importance than the still
active agent of the enemy griffin was
recalled from pursuit of benson just as the
trail began to grow warm he returned
from sydney on the same steamer that had
landed him and the years went by with the
case of benson docketed-filed but not
forgotten it was a cold scent when griffin
took it up again while part of the world
at least settled slowly very slowly down
towards normal

  griffin was human professionally a
man like benson was to him as a fox to a
hound that part of it was automatic
personally he held a warm mans hatred
towards the human vermin who deliber-
ately won the confidence of the ill-advised
or the unadvised and robbed them by

methods that left the victims helpless
this man had made beggars out of some
women so that he could enjoy the loot with
others he robbed the fatherless and the
widow without compunction and swag-
gered in many res at his home he was
a virtuous citizen in new york he smiled
to be pointed out as a roue on top of it all
he had played traitor his part in the war
had been one of chicanery a carpet-
bagger was a gentleman beside him and
griffin took up the chase with a grim satis-
faction that matched his determination

  but there were two sides to griffin just
as there are two sides to velvet stern
and implacable though without rancor
wherever business was concerned griffin
had a soft as well as a seamy side to his
nature he was born with an eye for
color and an ear for music the arts did
not claim him yet he was at heart a poet
he was such a good judge of poetry that
he abandoned his own attempts but he
never traveled without one or more pocket-
editions to him the sea was beautiful
and for him others more gifted expressed
his feelings to his supreme content he did
not read his verse in public but went on
deck primed with it and returned to it in
his own cabin with renewed delight

  none suspected him of such a trend
none ever guessed his profession for that
matter he had no wife no home beyond
bed and sitting-room in washington where
a discreet landlady enjoyed him as her
only lodger and where he repaid her good
offices by making her garden a glorious
perfumed riot-peonies predominating he
was a stocky middle-sized middle-aged
man inconspicuous yet affable he was
the sort of man to whom many people con-
fided their troubles-principally domestic-
and to whom he gave excellent advice out
of his knowledge of human nature

  he was generally thought to be some-
thing in insurance or else a traveling audi-
tor but on the miowera going out to syd-
ney he let it be understood that he was a
botanical chemist being assured that he
would find benson somewhere in the south
seas benson had not had money enough
in hand to seek indefinite sojourn in some
country where the extradition courtesies
are not exchanged and knowing his mans
tendencies knowing that he had formerly
headed for sydney through san francisco
two thresholds of the southern pacific
n

adventure

griffin felt sure that he would find him
somewhere between capricorn and cancer
his own role of botanist would give him
excuse for rambling

  griffin believed in finding his man first
and securing local official warrant after-
wards experience had taught him that 
this was the best way local justice might
be blinded by a bank-note bandage pe-
culiarly opaque local gossip ran fast
and far ahead where the law was invoked
a policeman off his beat in the south
seas is notoriously looking for a criminal
and his company is equally suspicious-

  griffin went to sydney only to tranship
to suva he had learned that his man
had gone to the fijian capital on his pre-
vious trailing when recalled it was his
habit to keep in touch with the fugitives
with whom he was officially concerned
many a man heartsick and homesick
venturing at last back to gods country of
home had been met on the borders by this
medium sort of a man whose gray eyes were
remorseless and whose methods of taking
in charge were tremendously if unosten-
tatiously efficient

  there was some luck in his meeting
harris not an unusual amount since suva
like port said honolulu singapore and
shanghai is a cross-roads and since harris
invariably made it his intermittent head-
quarters he picked harris with certainty
as a rascal finding him in one of the water-
front places he wandered into and he
managed to hint to harris that he was in
some trouble with his firm-that he had
sold them out over a valuable discovery
and therefore was inclined to lay low
inside of forty-eight hours he had turned
harris inside out like an old glove had
heard of the brotherhood and the lamented
demise of rumbo williams

   e got too bloody fresh with a woman
from the ills said harris now is
eads angin up in a clubouse somewheres
dried i elped bury what they left of im
caught im spoonin with the woman they

did	probably sneaked up on im through
the bush and got im with a ead ook
thats a loop of cane on the end of a stick
with a spike they jab through the top of
your spine when they jerk back e was
a nasty mess when we found im the
ants ad got at im reckon they cooked
the woman she was gone

  over the fiery rum with griffin absorbing

his tots until harris declared with enthusi-
asm that he must possess a hollow leg
harris reminisced of rumbo griffin recog-
nised it as a likely lead and elbowed him
along the mental trail until benson appeared
like a picture thrown on a screen clearly
focussed by harris ancient grudge

  id ave copped that girl if it adnt been
for im the blighter its too bad the
brotherhoods busted up matey no one
else ad rumbos pull but i can put you
up to a ideout

  griffin deftly led him back to benson and
the next day he took opportune ship for
tahiti thence from papeete to hiva-oa
in the marquesas in a trading schooner
the trail was warm again

  for seven hundred and fifty miles of
sailing griffin gave his poesy full rein
watching the birds and the fish the argosies
of trade clouds the purple seas by day and
the phosphorescent breakers at night a
milky path of trembling radiance the
winds the stars intrigued him and he
read in his pocket-edition of keats magic
casements waiting to see the islands rise
out of the sea lonely unvisited without
cable or wireless ideal losing-places but
sure of his man

 the land smiled mount temetiu
swathed in sulfur mists waited the strength-
ening of the sun the high crags were
already tipped withamberbelow them dense
foliage ran crisp as lettuce down to the
fronded palms on the bluffs where cascades
fell waving into the sea blow-holes
spouted at the foot of the cliffs and the
spray surged like smoke

  here was hiva-oa the bloody isle
peaceful now and supremely beautiful
griffin and his dunnage were landed on the
beach at atuona where the deep ravine
back of the tiny settlement lay in violet
shadow shot with gleams of green like an
opal he registered at government house
in his assumed character and three days
later started on his wanderings in the in-
terior escorted by a native body-servant
bearer and interpreter a trinity of useful-
ness with skin of bronze loin-clad in a scarlet-
and-yellow pareu the speed of mercury
the body of apollo and the guileless
nature of a laughing faun regarding
griffin as a foolish white man who paid
well to be shown plants which to talofu
were common as dandelions to a new
england chore-boy
nemesis

h

  a beau and a dandy was talofu boasting
of his conquests a bearer of gossip and a
gatherer of news

talofu led the way along the
heights bordering cliffs that looked
into fairy ravines everywhere
flowers were blooming on the trees or hung
like butterflies on the orchid sprays
palms and breadfruit bananas guavas
candle-trees bright colored birds fra-
grance high up fantastic crags where
the verdure ended cloud-wreathed fast-
nesses to which they worked a toilsome but
fascinating way trailing at the last through
a dense forest that led to a barren ridge a
spine of volcanic-rock finned above two
valleys leading to a sheer precipice split
by a deep fissure down which thundered a
waterfall

  griffins face was set talofus was as
grave but tinged with uneasiness

  you go along back of that vaitapu
forbidden water he said i think
better you not go maybe that man is
dead me i stop along this place

  griffin saw that the gay marquesans
skin was gray that the man was quivering
like a dog that scents a mysterious danger

  no good along that place i tell you
he persisted but would give no reason for
his evident fear that griffin set down to
some ancient superstition he admitted
that the white man he had babbled about
lived there-and not alone further in
speech or on trail griffin could not cajole
or bribe him

  the intuition born largely of rule of
thumb bolstered by a hundred hard-
earned lessons of experience told griffin
that his man was there

  benson had chosen well there was a
tapu of some sort on the place a gorge
masked by the waterfall barricaded by
native credulity and reticence yet swore
talofu a place of wonders once beloved
of the gods

  griffin left talofu begging him not to
venture retreating into the forest before
he was well out on the ridge

  there was a cave back of the fall pierced
by an arch that led to a narrow glen beau-
tiful it was but somber visited briefly by
the sun each day the air was dank the
foliage wet with mists that hung about
the crests of the high walls waiting for
evening to descend there was a silence

about the place that affected griffin un-
pleasantly keen on the scent as he was

  here he fancied some tremendous battle
might have been fought in the old days or
the spot was one of heathen rites the home
of passed sorcerers a secret place where
cannibalism made its last stand

  there was a faint trail through the tangle
and he followed its slippery windings
ahead he heard a low pounding sound
he passed crumbling platforms of dry-
laid stone sites of perished buildings
houses or temples the hollow noise became
plainer and suddenly he paused on the edge
of a clearing and gazed unseen at an old
hag shrunken to sexlessness her skin like
shagbark white hair over her eyes mum-
bling as she struck feebly but steadily at
a strip of bark-cloth on a hollow log

  deaf toothless and half-blind she did not
look up as griffin detoured about her
dodging from bush to tree she seemed the
eery witch of the place humanity shriveled
out of her

  the trail took up on the other side of
the clearing where straggly taro grew in a
swamp clutching at wet boughs that
made a tunnel of the path griffin bored
through it his automatic was loose in a
side-pocket benson was not the type to
be taken back on a silken leash his was
the courage of bravado coupled to the
desperation of a cornered rat so griffin
estimated it

  he came out into a banana grove the
banners flaccid yellowish rather than green
with sickly white shoots innumerable
insects buzzed and stung

  in the middle of the plantation-if it was
that-a tumbling rotten thatch was sup-
ported on uneven poles the miserable hut
occupying half of a tottering platform the
rest open a hammock slung between posts
litter was all about the mouldy air
was charged with offensive smells of ordure
and garbage

  there was scant light and at first
griffin peering through a cloud of mos-
quitoes did not recognise the squatting
bundle for a man then he distinguished
the figure cross-legged clad in filthy pants
once white perhaps and the remnant of
a singlet the man moved and his naked
flesh gleamed strangely white his feet
were bare his face was bloated as if
with stings of insects puffed and swollen
out of recognition tufted as it was with


adventure

an unkempt beard and mustaches that
looked mangy

  but it was benson griffin knew as he
gazed in a maze of swift repulsion that it
was benson benson the debonnair the
boulevardier of broadway

  his gun came out of his pocket as he
advanced his jaw set his gray eyes metallic
the man stood up swaying his arms hang-
ing loosely like stuffed appendages

  something opened in his face a hideous
caricature of a mouth as his face carica-
tured a badly-stuffed lions head with its
protuberant forehead and eyes that flickered
in deep sockets a harsh sound-it might
have been a laugh issued from the gap be-
tween mustache and beard

  i want you benson said griffin
no foolishness put up your hands
benson cackled he spoke hoarsely
slobberingly

  come at last have you never mind

my hands you see-

  the old crone came hurrying through the
flaccid bananas carrying a wooden bowl
she halted looking stupidly at griffin

the economics

by j d

mug self-satisfaction usually char-
acterizes the attitude of the white
man in his dealings with so-
called backward peoples he
takes neither the time nor the trouble to
understand the races with which he comes
in contact until it is too late

  take for instance head-hunting in the
solomons- it was a widespread practise
and it came to interfere with the planter in
need of labor and the missionary in search of
converts so the administrator was called
in he put an end to head-hunting in
short order in the islands where there were
white residents

  head-hunting was the focus around which
centered all the social and religious in-
stitutions of the people heads were
needed as propitiatory offerings to the
tribal ghosts on such occasions as building
a new house or making a new canoe and
not only were heads needed for religious
purposes but they stood in the closest
relation to pursuits of an economic
nature

  the actual head-hunting expedition only

   what do you want me for griffin
 isnt it come to take me back griffin
 not this time

   he cackled again as griffin his gun ready
 for some move a curious nausea possessing
 him as he scrutinized his man moved
 closer

   moneys all gone grif i didnt have
 much last of it bribed the old dame to
 feed me till i die-or she does you
 wouldnt think she was a golden woman
 once would you there were others-
 but theyve gone and you cant take me
 back griffin

   why not griffin heard himself speak
 as a stranger horror was crawling on him

   the animal face crimsoned suddenly
 as benson extended his arms they were
 shapeless and scaly they ended in hands
 that were fingerless save for one thumb
 not scarred but smooth as a snakes skin
 and silver white

   i cant feed myself griffin theres
 no one else in the world but this hag whod
 stuff my mouth do you know of any
 port that lets in a leper

of head-hunting

newsom

 lasted a few weeks and the actual fighting
 often only a few hours but this was the
 culmination of a process lasting over years
 it was the rule that new canoes should be
 made for an expedition to obtain heads
 and the manufacture of these meant work
 of an interesting nature lasting for many
 months probably for years

   the process of canoe-building was ac-
 companied by rites and feasts which not
 only excited the liveliest interest but also
 acted as stimuli to various activities of
 horticulture and pig-breeding as the date
 fixed for the expedition approached even
 more rites and feasts were held

   in putting down head-hunting the alien
 rulers were destroying an institution which
 had its roots in the religion of the people
 and spread its branches throughout nearly
 every aspect of their culture at one
 stroke these islanders lost their religion
 and their incentive to work and produce
 they are dying of sheer boredom for what
 has been offered them in exchange is too
 totally different to make the slightest
 appeal to their collective imagination

t the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

        help me groaned joseph gilbert to maria
the monte dealer as he saw her sweep in his
last dollar it was not my money i lost i am a
thief

  the young vermonter had lost fourteen hundred
dollars belonging to friends in coloma a mining
camp in southern california

  to maria his was simply another ludicrous case
she was accustomed to seeing men losing other
peoples money in gambling halls in these flam-
boyant days of  when the wild hilarity of the
 gold rush had not yet checked itself san fran-
cisco saw many things that a more conventional
time would have been shocked over

  the girls laugh died out joaquin murieta
mexican bandit and five masked men had entered
the gambling-hall on their heels came old mis-
ery the man from the mountains-old misery
who was the most expert knife-thrower in cali-
fornia

  in a twinkling murieta had shot the lights out
in the darkness men grappled with each other help-
lessly gilbert shaken and trembling endeavored
to escape groping blindly his hand found a win-
dow curtain and he drew it back before he could
stir the bandits leaped through the window each
carrying a bag of gold

  in a moment gilbert had also cleared the window
sill as he landed on the ground his hand encoun-
tered a bag dropped by the bandits concealing
it under his coat he fled

   inside the lights on again old misery faced the
girl maria

  you aint bad at heart maria he said just
a trifle wild your grandpap wont lambast you
again

  when he left he took her with him old misery
was accustomed to taking care of other peoples

troubles this girl was going to be taken back home
again

  the next morning joseph gilbert took the bull
by the horns in his pocket was a ticket to sacra-
mento from there he would take the stage coach
to coloma afterward he would have to let fate
take its course in the bag he found three hundred
dollars which for the present he felt entitled to use

       landing at sacramento left gilbert con-
fused therefore it happened that he took the
wrong stage coach and as a consequence found him-
self bound for nevada city and opposite him sat
old misery and the girl maria he resigned himself
to the situation he was not anxious to reach coloma

  in nevada city gilbert met mr peters the gam-
bler exquisite talk concerning the raid of joaquin
murieta and his fellows on the gambling-hall in san
francisco ran feverishly it was being said that
murieta had been aided in his escape by a green-
horn yankee in desperation gilbert confessed the
whole affair to peters

  according to peters there was only one thing for
gilbert to do lay low until the thing had blown
over and after peters had persuaded old misery
it was decided that gilbert should seek refuge with
the mountain man in his home in the foot-hills old
misery had finally been prevailed upon to accept
the commission after his tame bear ben williams
fawned upon the young man

  just as old misery and gilbert were riding out
of nevada city bound for the foot-hills manuel
vesquio half-chinese half-mexican rode up be-
hind them

  hurriedly the breed told them that excitement
had broken out in the city and a posse was being
formed why he said he could only imagine

  theyre after me gasped gilbert

adventure

jjut they reached old miserys cabin safely

     the next morning gilberts panic was re-
sumed when he beheld a crowd of men coming up
the slope but they were not concerned with him
phelps of grass valley at their head intimated
strongly to old misery that he suspected him of
having built his cabin in a gold mine

  old misery grinned broadly

  what give you boys the notion id struck pay
dirt up here you know i never fuss with gold till
some one else has dug and cleaned it

  after a discouraged search the invaders departed
old miserys mocking laugh ringing in their ears as
gilbert and old misery were returning to the cabin
a masked man thrust a pistol into miserys face

  he robbed you gasped gilbert as the horse-
man galloped away

  no just took a peek at my medicine was the
mountain mans reply

  he exhibited a small bag in which he carried
about his neck a monte card scrawled across the
face were two words

  joaquin-amigo

  old misery explained how he had once rescued
joaquin murieta from drowning and the bandit had
presented him with the card

  ill spoil his hide the next chance i git misery
commented humorously

  to gilberts surprize he discovered that the girl
maria and her half-blind grandfather dom miguel
were living in a cabin in old miserys clearing
two lone prospectors also dwelt not far away
during the next few days misery was gone on mys-
terious jaunts left alone gilbert received hints
from maria confirming his impression that some-
thing strange was stirring in the clearing

  there also came word that joaquin murieta and
his marauders were raiding again old misery
home at night weary and lame from his curious pil-
grimages brought this news it also amused him
to know that his nevada city neighbors suspected
him of having discovered a goldledge gilbert had
the impression that misery in spite of his queer
indian superstitions was not quite so child-like as
he appeared

  one day misery left his little colony and went
down into the valley in time he entered coloma
in a barroom he found a crowd of men having fun
at the expense of pretty soon jim pipps mis-
ery who had known pipps in the old days-days
when he was first trying to scrape together enough
money to go back home in the east defended him

  that evening stacy the storekeeper was found
murdered the bartender endeavored to lay sus-
picion upon pretty soon jim pipps

  lets take a peek behind the bar misery sug-
gested suspiciously

  a blood-smeared bottle was found the bar-
tender leaped through the window the crowd after
him misery departed alone he was anxious to
find pipps and discover how he had become asso-
ciated with the crime

  that night as misery slept alongside of a cabin
just outside of coloma he was suddenly awakened
by the noise of horsemen approaching in the dim
light he saw they were murietas men from their
talk he knew they were after gold buried at this
spot by one of their former comrades as they were
lifting the last bag of gold from the hole they had
dug a mysterious figure loomed in the doorway of
the cabin the bandits fled dropping one bag

  it was pretty soon jim pipps he had been
sleeping off a carouse

  old misery decided he would see pipps safely on
his way home the contents of the bag would de-
fray his expenses they walked to the edge of the
slope where misery said they would part for
awhile to meet later misery was becoming dis-
turbed over the fact that his gold possessions were
becoming known to the public at large

yhen old misery thought it safe again he over-
took pretty soon jim as they were preparing
to have supper at tom tobins old cabin in illinois-
town a horseman rode up who said his name was
york misery suspicious directed pretty soon
to leave the cabin that night shortly after pipps
departure york entered the cabin and after a fight
in the dark misery killed him the dead man was
one of joaquin murietas band

  convinced that murieta would be looking for
the gold slugs which pipps had found the night
before misery went to nevada city and had the
slugs changed for gold dust by peters the gambler
who informed him that the man who had helped
murieta escape from the el dorado was still being
sought

  pipps made his appearance jubilant over the fact
that he spent his money for a gold mine by clever
salting misery convinced phelps that what he had
sold as a worthless mine was really a fortune and
phelps was only too glad to buy back at a big price
when he discovered he had had a dose of his own
medicine phelps vowed vengeance against old
misery

  at grass valley gilbert met lola montez the
actress and she used him as a means to making
phelps jealous phelps told him he was going to
marry the woman and warned him off maria
who was becoming increasingly fond of gilbert was
also enraged

  old misery and tobin left grass valley and
were trailed by phelps men bent on discovering
the location of the mountain mans gold mine
roger an actor in lola montezs company was also
with the trailers he dropped a note for old misery

  at the hotel de paris peters read the note to old
misery it warned him that gilbert was being at-
tacked

  by leaving tobin at the hotel de paris misery
convinced his pursuers that he was also on hand
and he slipped out of town unnoticed on his way
home he encountered ching-a-ling who told him
he had proposed to maria and that the girl knifed
him misery threatened violence if the breed mo-
lested the girl further

  gilbert who was also on his way back to grass
hollow with provisions met maria and she added
another warning to the ominous cloud that was
gathering

  when old misery joined gilbert and maria at
grass hollow he announced that he was going to
take gilbert away and avoid the man-hunters the
next morning when they looked for maria she was
gone

  only four people knew that you were in the
el dorado that night misery announced maria
told phelps-she was mad at you about that mon-
tez critter

  as they were leaving grass hollow three-
finger jack one of murietas lieutenants rode up
and announced-
old misery



  ching-a-ling was saying that maria is in ca-
hoots with murieta very soon he shall lose his
head

  when three-finger jack was gone misery told
gilbert that if murieta failed to kill ching-a-ling
he would do so himself also that he was con-
vinced maria had been taken away by murieta to
resume her former wild life

  misery declared he would get maria back at any
cost

    the little band was leaving it was discovered
that old miguel had disappeared misery fear-
ing impending disaster said they would have to
proceed without marias grandfather

  before they had gone far weymouth mass and
sailor ben appeared misery agreed to give them
a share in his gold mine if they should see maria or
ana benites as she was now known safe into mexi-
co they agreed just as the two parties were
about to split maria confessed

  i have been holding something back senor
comandante my grandfather has gone to slay
ching-a-ling for revealing my real identity

  dubious about blind miguels ability to de-
fend himself old misery announced he would
go down to nevada city and find him he left
the little band and said he would join them far-
ther on

  at nevada city old misery found great excite-
ment twenty horses had been stolen from adams
rancho and two men killed by horse thieves the
mob convinced that gilbert and maria were mixed
up in the affair were organizing a posse to capture
them after some difficulty misery learned that
ching-a-ling was a prisoner under guard in his own
cabin misery decided to find ching-a-ling and
kill him before miguel appeared

  in a moment of excitement when ching-a-lings
guards were distracted misery entered the cabin
he found miguel and ching-a-ling dead the lat-
ters head was completely severed from his body
marias grandfather after being fatally wounded
had finally revenged his granddaughter

  when he had joined his party waiting for him in

artin followed by all in the
cabin hurriedly passed outside
the newcomer was riding at a
smart gallop but not pressing
his mount somes was the first to recog-
nize him and called out-

  reelfoot williams

  martin advanced toward the outlaw and
waved his hand in greeting obviously he
held williams in some esteem the bandit
leaped from his horse and shook hands with
martin and nodded genially to the men the
latter admired him for being a lone worker
and one who could take desperate chances

  when williams gaze lighted on old mis-
ery he looked the surprize he was feeling
and exclaimed

  you here old man well im not try-
ing to hold you up again 

the hills misery gave gilbert his choice of going
with weymouth mass sailor ben and maria into
mexico or continuing with him

  i cant leave the united states gilbert de-
clared if i must lose myself give up my name
and be thought a thief at least ill stay in this
country

  spoken like a mountain man cried old mis-
ery and all - cant drive you out of the

rockies

  so the two factions divided old misery looked
back and saw his cabins afire in the distance the
pursuers were pressing them rapidly

the y walked rapidly and eventually discovered a
lone cabin in the woods old misery guessed it
was a storekeepers cabin while they stood there
wondering how they could secure supplies a band
of men rode up and made them prisoners

  snake martin the leader admitted he was a
lieutenant of joaquin murietas and that assisted
by the other men present he was responsible for the
slaying of the two men and the theft of the horses
from adams rancho accordingly misery pre-
tended he was also one of murietas valued men
and to prove his ability picked a fight with a giant
named evrick to the awe of every one misery-
won the fight

  martin said while misery and gilbert were his
prisoners he would nevertheless permit them to
wander unmolested around the immediate vicinity
of the camp it was on one of these walks that mis-
ery and gilbert heard two of martins band plotting
to overthrow him and secure his money

  as time passed and they heard more concerning
the cruelty of martin misery was convinced they
would have to make a bold attempt at an escape
as a prelude to this he pretended drunkenness and
innocently picked up a bow and arrow in the corner

  drop that martin commanded pointing a pis-
tol at him

  the old fool is drunk chief said one of his men

  at this moment there was a stir from gilbert

  here comes a man riding hard he yelled from
the window

  and he laughed at his recollections
you know this man reelfoot eagerly
asked martin

  know him not long since i held him
up on the ridge above nevada city he
had a rare bag of nuggets and what do
you think i didnt take it

  and he laughed more heartily

  no no they were not for reelfoot
williams met rattlesnake dick right
after to work in harness for a big pot told
him about it and he said the same he
wouldnt a touched them if hed stood in my
boots remember old man what i said
not any for me thank you good joke on
me martin there i had dogged him from
town where hed been giving nuggets to
chinamen and then i held him up and
opened his bag of gold-and didnt take it


adventure

  just what are you driving at reelfoot
cried martin sensing a mystery and there-
fore feeling uneasy

  the first thing i saw in the bag was a
monte card with amigo written on it and
signed by murieta joaquins card you
know telling all us bold boys this man
was not to be bothered i never worked
with the greaser he does too much un-
necessary killing but i wont go out of my
way to make him mad oh no the min-
ute i saw that card i knew i didnt want
any of that game no sir same old cuss
who threw a lariat around murieta and
pulled him out the american when he was
about to drown but how comes it he is
on this side the ridge quit murieta to
take on with your boys

  i was just about to kill him softly
explained martin he talks too much
makes my head ache by always telling

what a-of a fellow he is i intended to

wait and find out the truth about him but
his talk was driving me crazy just as you
rode in came here yesterday with a
young man done nothing since except
brag how he can lick any man in any kind

of a fight-

  i can do it it aint bragging broke
in old misery

  there you hear him wailed martin
the veins over his temples congesting again

  it struck reelfoot williams as being very
humorous and he laughed loudly and
clapped a hand on martins shoulder and
drew him to one side they talked for some
minutes when they returned to the door-
way martins anger had vanished he
briefly announced

  williams speaks in his favor also says
its true about the young man helping
murieta escape at the bay

  and that he must have helped ana
benites one of joaquins band to escape
a posse reminded williams and that
jaoquins nevada city spy vesequio who
betrayed the girl was found with his head
cut off

  what did i tell you folks proudly
asked old misery now be you ready to
believe ive a right to wear eagle feathers
were believing youre entitled to horses
a mule and your weapons and a clear
road quietly replied martin but if it
hadnt been for that crazy bear dance youd
be dead

  gilbert advanced to stand beside his

friend his face shining with joy at the pros-
pects of an immediate departure from the
terrible place he groaned inwardly as old
misery persisted-

  but i was hankering to join this
outfit

  hope returned to the young mans heart
when martin shook his head firmly and
declared

  impossible you need too much room
theres not enough room for you and me
in the same outfit your talk makes me
think red id have to shoot you to stop
your tongue

  if i wasnt playing a lone hand id take
you on in a second old man said wil-
liams but i couldnt take both of you
even if i wanted a partner threes an
awkward number in a running fight al-
ways one has to go it alone might blab to
save his neck then again california isnt
what it used to be its getting well organ-
ized gang work is playing out another
season will see the electric telegraph hook-
ing up the northern and southern camps and
towns its got so a man to make a decent
living must work fast and sly and ride
alone

  then what about murieta anxiously
asked old misery

  think you were wise to cross the ridge
promptly replied williams theyre
bound to get him think theyll get him
this season his band is too big rewards
offered for him dead or alive are growing
too fast too many posses after him

old misery gravely asked martin
when can we start were ready any
time slong as you dont want us the
quicker were bout our business the better
gilbert drew his first free breath since
coming to the cabin

  ill send a man to the grazing grounds
for mounts and a mule your weapons
are in the cabin you can get away to-
morrow morning in the mean time youre
your own men of course go where you
will do what you will but stop that cursed
boasting i wouldnt stand it evefx from
murieta himself

  youve got some dust and a blanket roll
of mine take pay for the horses and mule
out of it said misery

  martin grinned sardonically and re-
torted-

  sorry but theres just about enough
dust to square the shot

i
old misery



  let it go at that calmly agreed old
misery although his averted gaze was
dangerous reckon i know where to pick
up plenty more well catch up and ride
in the morning

  williams left his horse to graze in front
of the cabin while he entered and ate he
was in a mood of reckless jollity and im-
pressed the men as having much respect for
old misery martin did not relish this but
contented himself with ordering a man to
bring two mounts and a pack-mule from
the southern grazing grounds he stressed
the importance of haste in bringing up the
animals

  were making for the humboldt road
riding our way asked the mountain man
of williams

  starting back tonight by way ot the
walker river country they were hot on
my trail and i had to cross and lose myself
if i can hit the head of the south fork of the
american i can make frisco safest place
for me just now ill have to light out for
good pretty soon may try salt lake city
join the church you know youd better
be pulling out as soon as you can or some
one will be coming over the ridge to find
you

  looked like the game was played out
when i quit said old misery

  and with that he rejoined gilbert who
was nervously waiting outside the house
and he pleased the young man by suggest-
ing-

  lets take a walk and find out what that
young hellion of a dart again has been
doing

  with the exception of bommer and
somes and jose who was waiting on ev-
rick the gang was inside the long house
hungrily listening to the talk of martin and
williams old misery led the way toward
the woods fringing die south side of the
valley jose the mexican cut across his
course and the mountain man saw a knife
slip from the red sash he picked it up
and called out in spanish for the man to
turn back and get what he had lost

  jose turned back and thanked him in
broken english old misery answered in
spanish telling him he was welcome

  then jose in his own tongue hurriedly
said

  i dropped the knife so i could speak
with senor i am a friend to any one
who helps one of our women you helped

senorita ana benites you saved the great
joaquins life my life would be lost if the
comandante knew that i know what i
know lost again if he knew i was telling
you he took your bag of gold into the
woods on the north side while you and the
men were sleeping i was up waiting on
the sick man he came back without the
gold

  old misery nodded and resumed his way

  what was the fellow jabbering about
asked gilbert

  said our gold is hid on the opposite side
of this valley im hankering to take it
along with me that bag must be worth
moren a thousand dollars

  lets forget the gold and get away from
here begged gilbert im more afraid
of these men especially that martin than
id ever be of indians he gives me the
shivers

  well clear out soons we can but this
gang isnt of much account cept in talk
blood-hungry all right but they can be
tamed calmly assured old misery my
medicine has pulled us through this far
ive made them think were their kind and
ive made martin hanker to have us go
he made one bad mistake he oughter
been white nough to hand back my
bag of nuggets his minds narrer he
may lose his pelt by trying to keep that
bag

  they entered the woods and followed
along the edge for half the length of the val-
ley before old misery found a spot that
suited him then he lighted his pipe and
gilbert picked up the adventurous trail of
dartagnan but the young man turned


adventure

only a few pages before the mountain man
was interrupting him by saying

  reckon ill scout south toward the hoss-
herd hosses are nearer than martin let
on you wait here for me if any one
comes along its all right to tell where i
went were free men now

  ill believe that when weve left this
place and those men itll be dark soon
if the hosses aint close by ill go until
i strike the trail from the house if i aint
showed up when it gits along the edge of
dark you can go back to the cabin if they
ask bout me say i struck off to the south
to have a look at the hosses

  gilbert disliked being left alone but was
ashamed to say as much he watched his
friend disappear in the growth to the south
and then returned to his book old misery
however walked but a short distance be-
fore changing his course to travel west
moving with the long even stride of his
kind he soon turned the end of the valley
and was traveling along the north side to the
east

  when about opposite gilberts position
he worked deeper into the growth and did
not pause until on the west side of the small
opening containing the graves then he
crawled under the low-hanging branches of
a scrub evergreen and sucked his cold pipe
and waited with the patience of a red man

  the shadows crept deeper into the open-
ing squirrels played in and about the
covert never suspecting the motionless fig-
ure possessed life at last old misery put
up his pipe shifted to a sitting posture and
muttered

  some risky if im seen prowling round
out there but tunkan is with me noth-
ing like a rock-medicine if youre keen to
search under ground martin will be talk-
ing and drinking with williams tothers
keep clear of this place along of the ghosts
he came to his feet yet hesitated
neither did he relish trespassing on the
burial ground because of his strong hor-
ror of earth burials he firmly believed vic-
tims of interment always felt resentful and
hovered about their graves then snake
martin walked rapidly from the south end
of the opening entering at the point where
gilbert and misery had lounged under a
tree and the former had pointed out the
graves

  old misery smiled grimly and patted the
bag holding his rock-medicine surely

tunkan had directed him wisely and his
luck was greater than he had had reason to
expect he had believed he must make the
search for the hidden bag of gold in person
and now another had come who would save
him that trouble martin was in a hurry
and was carrying what appeared to be a
ramrod he kept his head swinging suspi-
ciously from side to side as he approached
the graves

  he halted at the first mound and turned
and stared about remaining stationary
he rested both hands on top of the iron rod
after holding this posture for some moments
he wheeled and walked beyond the graves
for some distance then swung to the east
side of the opening and disappeared into
the timber

  clever cuss muttered old misery
only needs a few seconds with that ram-
rod to make sure his stealings is where he
left em

  and without prosecuting his search far-
ther he withdrew and ran rapidly to the
west rounding the end of the valley he
struck deep into the growth and did not
shift his course until about due south of
gilberts position when he broke through
the last cover he beheld gilbert standing
book in hand

  im mighty glad you came back ex-
claimed gilbert

  whos been along since i quit you
not a soul but it was tedious waiting
wont have to wait any more no one
knows we aint been together all the time
and well let it go that way weve been
killing time and youve been reading to me
bout dart again now well go back and
eat a bite

  what good did your wandering do you
see the horses asked gilbert

  no never saw a hoss but they aint far
off feet git to itching if i stay too long
in one place medicine told me to walk
round a bit

on arriving at the house they
found reelfoot williams had taken
his departure old miserys first
act was to enter the house and pick up solid
comfort and examine him carefully snake
martin watched him but made no objec-
tion then the mountain man selected his
revolver and long knife from a shelf and
found gilberts rifle

  you seem to be in a hurry spoke up
old misery



martin in his thin voice going to start
on foot

  nary a start on foot when weve paid
for hosses and a mule replied old misery
paid a good price too nigh on to two
thousand dollars in that bag you took
from me

  two hundred is nearer right snarled
martin youre lucky to have your heads
on your shoulders

  well we aint thanking you for our
heads

  your blankets are in the corner that
makes all your property i believe

  youre forgitting the younkers pocket-
knife reminded misery

  hes lost that i warn you to talk about
something else said martin softly

  i dont want it let him have it
nervously whispered gilbert tugging the
mountain mans fringed sleeve

  just as you say younker but its fool-
ish to heave away property like that i
could trade that knife for a prime war-pony
with any plains tribe youll never git
anything ahead for a rainy day if you make
presents so free-hearted an martin i
never took kindly to being warned lets
understand youve warned us for the
last time and the next time youll be-
gin to show your mettle now what time
can we start from this place early
morning

  martin was in a most venomous mood
and perhaps regretted allowing the two to
have their weapons

  the man will bring the horses and mule
to the south edge of the clearing very soon
ill send a man to tell him to fetch them
here the quicker you two light out after
he comes the better itll suit me and the
safer itll be for you

  old misery grinned widely and reminded
 nother of them warnings but its
simply mazing how our minds have the
same thoughts you want us to go and we
want to go first the hosses couldnt be
fetched till midnight now theyll come
up almost any time

  martin fighting to hold his temper under
control went outside bommer who had
been lounging in the doorway entered to
take a drink and murmured to old misery
better quit pestering him hes blood-
mad

  thanky kindly some of you fellers
oughter kill the skunk

  how much dust was in the bag he took
rapidly whispered bommer

  rising two thousand dollers clean
nuggets not dust

  bommer lowered the jug and hastily
made for the door old misery threw him-
self on a bunk and told gilbert

  if you want along id stay here and
watch things bust up snake martins go-
ing to lose all his rattles if he aint mighty
careful

  i wouldnt stay here a minute longer
than absolutely necessary for a million dol-
lars muttered gilbert

  i wouldnt neither man with a million
dollars needs a stronger medicine than i
ever could scare up i dont know just how
much a million dollars is but i know its a
million troubles and thats a heap think
ill snooze a bit till they cook supper well
soon be on our way this is just something
thats happened thats all youll laugh
when you tell bout it a year from now
gilbert did not feel that he could ever
laugh again he sat beside the bunk and
in the rapidly failing light attempted to dis-
tract his mind by reading the story-book
but there was not enough wizardry even in
dumas to keep the sinister figure of snake
martin from his thoughts it was the in-
satiable cruelty of the man his bloody ruth-
lessness that appalled gilbert physically
he was contemptible exemplifying evil he
was monstrous fortunately for gilberts
peace of mind martin remained outside

  once the young man heard him cursing
evrick in a shrill wailing voice and his
blood grew cold from fear that murder was
being done bommer and somes came and
sat in the doorway and exchanged words
without glancing at each other others of
the gang sprawled out on the grass and
smoked and recounted various gruesome
bits of history that they should feel proud
and boastful of their crimes amazed gilbert

  at last a man entered and raked the coals
in the fireplace together and commenced
cooking the evening meal bommer and
somes left the doorway martin entered
briskly and stopped before the bunk and
stared at old misery gilbert held his
breath and waited martins hand dropped
to the handle of a revolver in the waistband
of his trousers then came away empty
without a word he turned and began pac-
ing up and down the long room gilbert
knew the outlaw leader was in a black mood


adventure

and surreptitiously shook his friend by the
shoulder

  old misery rolled on his side and mur-
mured

  hand-gun under the blanket had him
covered all the time he was never closer
to-then when he felt for his gun

  the fire had succeeded in heating up a
kettle of cooked meat and the cook carried it
outside together with an apology for bread
martin continued walking up and down the
room old misery yawned and slipped
from the bunk and tucked solid comfort
under his arm and startled both martin and
the young man by sounding his war-whoop

  then he explained

  grub i smell grub biled meat al-
ways hoot when meats ready

  he hurried outside and gilbert kept at
his heels bommer and somes drew back
as if making room for them the others
now ranged in a circle around the kettle
affected not to be aware of their presence
but they could not resist stealing frequent
glances at the man who reelfoot williams
had said was joaquin murietas friend as
well as the slayer of the spy who had be-
trayed one of murietas band

  martin came from the house and helped
himself to a dish of the meat and sat down
outside the circle jason took a position
near his chief his grinning teeth tearing
wolfishly at the food

  old misery broke the silence by tossing
a slab of bread aside and condemning it

 thats - poor chawing oughter

had my young pard here make you some
bread

  you wont have to put up with our bread
long gently martin reminded him its
the best we have were sorry you dont
like it

  beggars shouldnt go to finding fault
huskily remarked jason between his closed
teeth

  any one says were beggars is a liar
complacently retorted misery and gilbert
quailed weve paid frisco prices for all

the grub we eat and that breads -

poor them as like it that way are lucky

  silence followed this reiterated reminder
concerning the bag of gold bommer
nudged somes with his elbow the circle
of men stiffened then came the scuffling of
heels drawn back as if the men were making
ready to leap up and dodge bullets but
martin staring at old misery said noth-

ing jose came up to the kettle and dished
out two helpings and turned to take them
back to the helpless evrick because of
the gathering darkness he did not see mar-
tins outstretched leg and tripped over it
the leader exploded in a high-pitched yell
and kicked the man savagely jose mut-
tered apologies and limped away

  the men hastily finished eating and drew
farther back from the kettle each sensing a
sinister tension old misery continued eat-
ing watching martin he felt bommer
press his arm in warning as the outlaw rose
to withdraw the mountain man contin-
ued eating using his left hand only his
right resting on solid comfort which was
cradled in his lap the muzzle toward jason
and martin

  martin suddenly rose and entered the
house old misery shifted his position to
where bommer was standing the latter
began filling his pipe and from the corner of
his mouth warned-

  look out

  old misery amazed him by making for
the house and entering gilbert and the
men waited for the explosion but nothing
happened

  gilbert heard bommer tell somes-
storm passed round us the young
man decided this remark meant that some
expected climax had failed to materialize

  inside the cabin martin was saying to
old misery-and taking care to keep his
voice subdued

  you two had better ride for it as soon
as your horses come its for you to choose
but i really think its better you go as soon
as possible

  meaning you cant keep the-inside

you chained up much longer said the
mountain man bluntly i ree with you
well light out when the hosses come but
if i was here alone id be keen to stick
along

  others have felt the same way theyre
still staying here and will stay here after
were through with this camp

  planted out in that little opening
mused old misery its a handy place for
a burying i come nigh laffing when you
said some of the donner party was buried
there

  theres plenty of room for more graves
quietly added martin you can ride very
soon ill tell the cook to pack up some
supplies	j
old misery



  he left the house and old misery fol-
lowed as far as the doorway and sat down
martin spoke to the cook who hurried into
the house and began making up a pack of
supplies gilbert stole up to the door and
sat on the threshold beside his protector
old misery told him

  my medicine says theres going to be a
most tarnal fuss for the first time since
coming here we hold the best cards weve
got our weepins back and if anythings
going to bust loose i want it to come now
while weve got the house empty and the
gang in front of us

  yet he surrendered this advantage once
he saw snake martin start for the south
side of the valley he told gilbert

  im going out on a little scout if any
one asks for me say you dont know wont
be much of a lie at that

  and he chuckled softly and surprized the
vermonter by stepping back into the room

  the cook staggered out with an armful
of supplies andold misery slipped through
the rear window the dusk was thickening
and all the band were in front of the house
bending double the mountain man made
for the north side of the valley and found it
dark night inside the timber his unerring
sense of location permitted him to pene-
trate the growth in a straight line to the
opening and passing around to the west he
took up his position in the spot from which
he had spied on martin two hours before

  his ears rather than his eyes told him
when the outlaw leader entered the open-
ing there came the sound of steel grating
on stones and the softer sound of dirt being
thrown aside old misery wormed his way
into the opening and was quite close to mar-
tin as the latter finished his labors and with
a grunt of satisfaction started for the tim-
ber the mountain man rose and walked
after him his form bent far forward al-
though there was no sky-line to betray his
presence

  he trailed martin to a point due north
of the cabin then waited until the man be-
gan working his way farther east he knew
why martin had halted before making a
detour around the eastern end of the valley
and he was not surprized when he advanced
to the foot of a big pine and with his foot
located a mound of needles

  rapidly exploring the contents of several
bags his lips parted in a snarl as his fingers
came in contact with rings and pins and

odd pieces of jewlry the other bags con-
tained gold in dust and nuggets the booty
doubtless obtained from homeward-bound
parties of gold-hunters or else stolen in some
of the camps or towns over the ridge what
he had unearthed he carried for a short dis-
tance after the man ahead and cached it
at the edge of the opening

  then he tore a limb from a sapling and
tossed it on the ground bending low he
raced at top speed for the end of the log
house halting beneath the window he lis-
tened the long room was dark and seemed
to be deserted from the front came the
idle talk of the men with a lithe move-
ment he slipped through the window and
astounded gilbert by suddenly sitting down
beside him in the doorway

  what-how- began gilbert

  how many been in here since i was
gone snapped the mountain man

  no one but the cook he came in and
picked up some bundles and hurried right
out nt one has spoken to me but

  keep shet my rock-medicine is work-
ing so hard for us that i can hear it whis-
pered old misery

  from the group on the grass outside
marked only by glowing pipe-bowls a man
challenged-

  whos that

  martin you fool whined the leader
who was returning from the south side of
the valley wheres that big-talker
right here old hoss-fiy called out the
mountain man

  thats a poor way to talk to me old
man admonished martin walking toward
the door

  more warnings just larn me whats
the right way and mebbe ill be keen to
try it

  ignoring him martin ordered-

  some of you make a light inside

  old misery and gilbert rose to their feet
and made room for jason to entrer and throw
some light stuff on the bed of coals as the
dancing flames lighted the room martin
entered and glared evilly at the vermonter
and the mountain man he abruptly an-
nounced 

  the animals will be here pretty soon
the minute they come i want you to pack
the mule and clear out

  thats all were waiting for mister
said old misery


adventure

  hosses coming now chief bawled one
of the men i can hear em

  theres only one hoss corrected
bommer

  with haste that denoted concern martin
rushed from the house to meet the new-
comer

  old misery touched gilberts arm and
shifted his rifle to his left hand so his right
would be free all could hear it now the
rapid thud-thud of a galloping horse

  riding like-for such a dark night

commented somes

 make a blaze out there whined
martin

  some one ran into the house and brought
out blazing brands and others tossed on
light fuel that soon dispelled much of the
darkness then the group waited in silence
for the horsemen to emerge from the black
wall and enter the light on came the horse
and up to the fire before the rider could be
recognized

  the man threw himself from the saddle
and cried

  its me-rockmore had to ride for my
life till i topped the ridge

  old misery whispered to gilbert

  keep awake and behind me its the
cuss that got away from the men in nevada
city

  martin advanced a few steps toward the
newcomer and querulously demanded
why aint you with the rest of the boys
wheres the stock

  had to ride for my life chief caught
in nevada city and only got loose by luck
and grit jumped the first hoss i saw
stock was to go through one of the southern
passes oughter been here before this the
boys had a good start when i rode for ne-
vada city to see what was up got nabbed
on spicion

  here comes the other boys now some
one announced

  but martin again was disappointed as
there was only one man riding into the fire-
light he was leading a horse and mule
martin loudly announced

  let that old loud-talker and his friend
mount and ride for it some of you throw
the grub on to the mule

  instead of jumping at the offer old mis-
ery held back clutching gilbert by the arm
two of the men were expertly fastening the
provisions on the mule the horses stolen
from some california rancho were good

ones misery held back until the packers
had finished rockmore was the man he
had questioned in nevada city and whose
escape had given him a chance to enter the
little chinese store and discover how old
miguel had satisfied his vengeance

  bold face he never see you cau-
tioned old misery to his companion

  and pulling his ragged hat low over his
eyes he left the doorway and swaggered
toward the horses

  climb into the saddle and get out
ordered martin

  bommer advanced a torch so the men
could make sure the mule-pack was cor-
rectly adjusted and as the additional light
revealed the mountain man rockmore gave
an incredulous cry and demanded

  wait a minute by- im not mis-
took that mans the friend of peters the
gambler in nevada city peters sent the
posses out after our boys that man is the
one who got me caught along of the adams
rancho killings you wont let him live
chief

  with a howl of rage martin pulled a re-
volver and screamed

  riddle both if they make a move
heres something to be looked into

  theres an empty hole out in the bury-
ing-ground that your men will like to look
into old misery quickly broke in that
hole once held the loot you hid there afore
bernie the frenchman died of poison
until you dug that stuff up and hid it again
this evening you was the only man alive
who knew where it was you men under-
stand this your leader planned to ride
away with the gold to ride alone and to
ride tonight i saw him dig it up and
bury it in a new place

  martin threw down his heavy gun and a
streak of fire and a loud explosion inter-
rupted the rest of the disclosure nd only
the intervention of joses arm saved the
mountain man from catching the lead

  the group of men were now in an up-
roar

  martin was screaming-

  who did that

  bommer was shouting

  old man talks straight the little-

is robbing us boys

  gilbert endeavored to drag old misery
to the horses but with his wild war-whoop
the mountain man rushed toward martin
the latter entangled in a struggling group
old misery



of men broke loose leaped forward knife
in hand to meet misery gilbert suddenly
found himself endeavoring to dodge a fierce
attack on the part of the grinning jason
he warded off several knife blows with the
barrel of his rifle and tried to use it as a club
but did not think to shoot jose slipped
in and dexterously stabbed jason through
the heart

  old misery and martin were engaged in
a knife fight the former stamping his heels
and sounding the war-cries of various
tribes he had lived with martins wailing
voice kept up a stream of horrible threats
as they circled about each endeavoring to
get the fire at his back and the light on his
antagonist

  bommer rushed to aid the mountain man
but was set upon by rockmore and the
man called ike

  -you you will have it he shouted

  and the double detonation of his heavy
gun cleared his path only now his pur-
pose was interrupted by the desertion of his
friend

  this way somes he cried making
after his swift-footed mate curse you
come back here

  but somes with the primal instinct to
destroy the thing he hated only thought of
reaching the wounded evrick and slaying
him no amount of buried treasure could
come between him and that satisfaction
the figure on the blanket possessed of a
hand-gun in some way shot somes off his
feet bommer took one shot and evrick
writhed and lay still

  with lightning rapidity martin was
forcing the knife play old misery giving
ground and falling back toward the horses
the mountain man taunted

  watched you bury the stuff dug it up
you cant ever find it

  their blades slithered and with a scream
of triumph martin took advantage of what
he believed to be an opening only to meet
death on the haft of the veterans knife

  gilbert found himself seized by the collar
and began fighting desperately old misery
snarled

  come along aint you had nough
bommer ceased exchanging shots with
the man who had brought up die horses and
mule and who now was crouching at the
end of the cabin and ran up as misery and
gilbert swung into the saddle

   stop or ill kill he yelled

   

  old miserys moccasin caught him under
the chin and toppled him over then the
mountain man was galloping for the growth
a hand on gilberts bridle and when he
halted their flight they had passed through
the timber and were several miles from the
cabin

  slipping to the ground he remarked

  that was a fuss worth while too dark
for a man to do his best snake martins
one of the niftiest knife-flghters i ever fit
with now we can sleep in peace in the
morning ill scout back and git grub and
certain things i cached

chapter xii

as proclaimed by tunkan

they traveled many days also they
loitered and camped and hunted
there were forced marches over dreary
deserts and barren mud-plains on the
eastern slopes of the humboldt they tarried
and gilberts interest in life faintly revived
at sight of numerous springs cascading
down the rocks

  the tumbling ribbons of silver reminded
him of natures prodigal waste of water
among the new england mountains in
early summer they made many side
excursions to nameless places and they
halted and did nothing for days in pleasant
spots at first gilbert had been watchful
for indians but in time became indifferent
to them as a menace

  from the first day out of the outlaws
valley old misery had commenced his
tutelage only his companion did not realize
it liberally supplied with ammunition the
mountain man contrived for his pupil to
shoot much of the meat they ate and
initiated him into the various ruses of the
hunter to educate a greenhorn some-
where near to a mountain mans standards
is a hard task only a great liking for the
vermonter held misery to the work

  old misery might have been somewhat
discouraged had he known how hungry his
friend was for civilization and how eagerly
he looked ahead to visiting salt lake city
very possibly the mountain man came to
suspect this yearning for wooden houses
and food on tables for although they fol-
lowed the immigrant road around the north
end of great salt lake and down the east-
ern side almost to the mormon metropolis


adventure

misery shifted their course on a cloudy day
and traveled east through ogden hole he
had hoped to deceive his friend until the
city of the saints was out of reach and
yet he was disappointed

  the fact was gilbert did not possess the
instinct of location without the sun to
guide him he could not orient himself on
all other points of woods mountain and
plain craft misery was confident the young
man would grow to high standards of excel-
lence on the most vital of all points he
showed but littie progress

  often the mountain man encouraged him-
self by secretly vowing

  hell come to it ill make him slow
myself at first

  he knew the last was false there had
never been a time he could remember when
placed anywhere he could not instinctively
name the points of the compass hav-
ing always possessed this instinct it was
hard to be patient with one who lacked it
but he liked gilbert few of his own genera-
tion were alive he had long since passed
the time when a man collects new friends
it had been an amazingly pleasing experi-
ence to have the boy take care of him in
grass valley in all his winter counts that
incident would remain most prominent

  tom tobin would have taken care of him
in a fight against hopeless odds and cheer-
fully have died in front of him but tom
would do it as misery would do it with a
mouthful of harmless oaths and a manner
brusk almost to brutality tobin showed
his liking by damning so did old misery
the boy had come to the bunk when he
believed misery was asleep and had rested
a hand on his forehead old misery almost
felt ashamed as he recalled and thrilled
over such intimate solicitude

  one night while studying his medicine
the notion struck him that had he had a
son it would bfe this gilbert he nourished
the fancy a bit ashamed as if it were a
weakness yet encouraging the idea a
mountain man wasted no time in placing a
hand on a pards head unless it was placed
there violently the idea wasnt permis-
sible except one conceive of a son doing it
then it became all right it logically fol-
lowed that gilbert should have been his
son young enough to be his grandson
and the old man created a little make-be-
lieve world in his mind wherein he had
raised a boy to look after him

  up and around the red chimney fork
of the weber they traveled and only as
time passed did the vermonter come to
suspect they were not making for the
city by the great lake he expressed his
regret

  the mountain man told him

  id like mortal well to obleege you but
theres reasons why id better not go visiting
the elders for a while once some of their
destroying angels jumped me thinking i
was another man afore the mistake was
found out id counted five coups were
well east of salt lake now

  then im mighty glad we didnt go
there warmly declared gilbert his disap-
pointment vanishing dont know what
id do if anything happened to you

  keep shet and dont talk heyoka
growled old misery feeling more highly
pleased than possible for him to express

  for the sake of convenience reenforced
by a feeling of affection gilbert began
to address misery as dad the old
mountain man fairly squirmed with delight
but was unusually brusk for several days

  gilbert was strongly stirred when they
came to the head of sulphur creek and was
told by his companion

  were at the rim of the basin bimeby
well strike east-flowing rivers

  id like to see one of those rivers mut-
tered gilbert his eyes homesick

  old misery studied him furtively then
he tried to change his line of thought by
profanely declaring

  -my moccasins but youll make a

mountain man yet youre a good shot
a mighty good shot young eyes youre
better at squaw work then i be you ride
well just two things for you to larn
fighting injuns and knowing where you be
when the sun dont shine just a bit more
spirit just a bit more liking for it and them
two things will come

  just wait till we strike jim bridgers
trading-post on the black fork of the green
hell put a love for mountains and injun-
fighting into your blood nother forty
miles will fetch us there no one can listen
to bridger and not turn mountain man on
the spot

  gilbert smiled rather grimly and re-
minded him

  nothing else for me to do is there dad
i cant go home you know and i cant
wander around alone id go in a circle
old misery



its mighty kind of you to bother with me
i feel as if i were holding you back

  -and- roared old misery fair-
ly bristling with delight any one would
think i was tending the whisky-trade in one
of the old rendezvous holding me back
from what i dont have to be on time for
nothing- but youll like bridger youll
like his place youll probly see shoshoni
utahs and uintahs injuns there

  one more camp and they came to the
fort it was built of pickets with sleeping-
quarters and offices in the center the en-
trance being through a strong gate on the
north side was a large and enclosed yard
where the stock was corralled for protection
against the indians and wild animals

  to old miserys great disappointment
bridger was away on the fort hall road and
would not be back for several weeks gil-
bert learned that the fort occupied the
neutral ground between the shoshoni and
crows on the north the dakotas on the
east the cheyennes on the southeast and
the utahs on the south here also the
immigrant road from the east divided one
fork leading to oregon by the way of fort
hall on the snake the other extending for
a hundred and twenty-five miles to salt
lake city

   well rest for a day or so old misery
told gilbert

   the latter was satisfied it was an excel-
lent place for a camp the vermonter was
 contrasting the sandy wastes with the thick
grass the absence of all timber with the
graceful groves of cottonwoods willows and
hawthorns a mile and a half above the
fort the fork divided into four streams clear
and sweet and reunited two miles below

   this combination of water and beautiful
islands with the bear river mountains for
a background was most pleasing gilbert
found but one flaw-the several camps of
indians around the fort it made him feel
uneasy to observe how carelessly old mis-
ery entered the skin lodges to talk with
former enemies and friends sometimes the
mountain man spoke the red mans language
and sometimes he depended upon the sign-
language

   i dont like it dad remonstrated gil-
bert theyll be doing you mischief

  like-they will roared old misery

immensely pleased but anxious to conceal
the fact when they can show me new
tricks youll be oldern me

  they tarried three days and gilbert was
willing to remain longer but the mountain
man suddenly decided he must be traveling
he had no set purpose that gilbert could
learn beyond his explanation that his feet
itched it was late in the afternoon that
old misery insisted they break camp gil-
bert would have preferred an early-morning
start

  they went down the fork five miles and
camped in a meadow on the right bank
where there was good grass a train for
salt lake city was passing carrying stores
to merchants the mountain man ex-
changed two nuggets for a liberal supply of
coffee and sugar articles which they had
long been out of and which were very scarce
at the fort

  on the next day they made twenty miles
following the immigrant road to the mouth
of the muddy when dust clouds told them
immigrant trains were coming old misery
complained and said he felt too crowded

  as they advanced gilbert collected white
yellow and smoky quartz fragments which
were sprinkled over the ground the moun-
tain man watched him closely and consulted
his rock-medicine then became gloomy of
mien

  gilbert noted his depression and asked
the cause

  i was hoping tunkan had a medicine for
you explained misery it made me think
that when i see you going after the colored
stones im fraid it aint so but dont
you fuss theres lots of medicines and
yours may be mighty strong without being
a tunkan one

  thus far the mountain man had been
unable to discover whether the rocks the
thunder birds the water or the sun
favored his young companion and being
in doubt meant a troubled frame of mind
because gilberts sense of location seemed
to be lacking old misery dismissed the sun
his own researches had seemed to eliminate
the stone god inasmuch as he was think-
ing in the terms of the dakota god-seeking
he was forced to believe gilbert was under
the protection of takuskansan or the mov-
ing deity or of the unktelii the water
god

  he may be so-wakan i dont know

nothing bout it mumbled the mountain
man and yet there abided the recollection
of gilberts inability to place himself when
the route was changed


adventure

  anxious to leave the white mans road
old misery was ready to start before sun-
rise they followed the road two miles
long enough to raise pilot butte the road
toward the butte was over an empty barren
plain the country was desolate and to
gilbert depressing but old misery con-
tinued to be in high spirits they covered
twenty-five miles and after making an easy
ford of a hundred and forty feet camped
on black fork

  the vegetation consisted of dwarf sage
and greasewood and black currant bushes
with much bunch-grass and occasional
thickets of willows gilbert simulated a
gaiety of spirits he was far from feeling and
old misery was hilarious in their lonely
surroundings

  where are we going asked gilbert

  nowhere in ticlar just looking the
ground over replied old misery his heart
aching as he began to realize his youthful
companion sensed but little as to their
general direction we may go as far as
fort laramie mebbe not bimeby well
swing back over the oregon road and turn
off north into the beaver head country
im kinda curous to see if things has
changed since i was up there last

 when they awoke next morning
it was to find the sky overcast and
to feel a chill wind to add to their
discomfort some thirty horsemen charged
down on the camp as they were preparing
breakfast

  gilbert yelled indians seized his rifle
rolled into a shallow depression and drew
a bead on the foremost rider old misery
threw his blankets over the young mans
head and warned-

  dont shoot

  gilbert got rid of the blanket and beheld
the indians spreading to encircle them old
misery was walking toward the horsemen
one hand raised the riders on the ends of
the half-circle galloped in closed the gap
and the mountain man was surrounded
gilbert remembered all he had heard about
indian torture and decided to die fighting
then the group opened and his friend was
returning accompanied by the red band
the mountain man shouted

  dont feel skittish theyre good
folks

  as he drew nearer he explained

  shoshoni friends of mine carrying

a pipe against some utahs thought our
smoke was made by their enemies

  but gilbert did feel skittish the
shoshoni looked very savage in their paint
some were armed with old rifles some had
sword-blades fastened to long poles for
lances every man carried a bow and a
quiver of war-arrows and around the neck
of each hung a small round shield

  old misery made them a feast of coffec
and sugar luxuries they were inordinately
fond of in return they presented to
the white men a buffalo-tongue and two
marrow-bones after making sure they
could have no more coffee and sugar the
warriors rode south in search of the utahs
by the time the marrow-bones were roasted
and eaten a drizzling rain set in gilbert
would have preferred erecting a shelter and
waiting for clear skies but to the mountain
man all weather was welcome

  they traveled to green river striking
it a mile above bitter creek and descended
a thirty-foot bank to splash eight hundred
feet to the opposite bank the gray sky
the pelting rain and the sullen river ini-
pressed gilbert as being dreary and dan-
gerous however at no spot of the crossing
did the water more than touch their stirrups

  the mile-wide bottom was dotted with
willows and heavily grassed old misery
hurried through this area the rain ceased
a thick fog taking its place gilbert was
soaked buffalo-berry bushes fifteen feet
in height stretched out branches through
the mist to scratch his face he tried walk-
ing and stepped in holes at last he urged
his companion to halt

   just a trifle more travel cheerily replied
the mountain man three injuns been
follering us ever since we broke camp
some of my shoshoni friends they hanker
to git our guns and horses good people
and all right but they cant help stealing
hosses n guns any moren white can help
driving chinamen n greasers from a rich
placer-claim or sailor ben can help drinking
whisky

  he took the lead as they entered the
bitter creek valley and warned gilbert to
cease talking after a few miles he was
forced to call a halt as their course was cut
by numerous deep gullies they were not
disturbed that night and the morning was
cloudless there were no signs of indians
gilbert believed he had never gazed on a
more desolate scene except in the great
old misery



basin than he beheld under the first light
the wash from the sandstone cliffs was so
continuous as to prohibit vegetation not
even a blade of grass was to be seen

  aint this a bully place enthusiastically
cried old misery lawd but im glad
to be back here once more

  mighty lonesome dad sighed gilbert
but misery warmly defended the valley
saying it had little snow in winter and in
the old days had been a favorite rendezvous
for trappers as they cooked and ate the
buffalo-tongue the mountain man reveled
in reminiscences speaking of times before
the invention of silk hats spoiled the beaver-
trade he reviewed the old-time mountain
men from ashley down and concluded his
talk by proudly declaring

  and youre to be one of the same tribe
and a mighty good one

  if im not it wont be because i didnt
have a good teacher agreed gilbert

 two more camps found them following
up the east or left fork of bitter creek
antelope were not numerous old misery
shot a buck and gilbert easily bagged a
half-dozen fat quail they came upon the
track of a big bear and the mountain mans
eyes lighted with love of the chase then
he surprized his companion by foregoing
the pleasure

  no chance to overtake him asked gil-
bert as they left the trail

  hes close by git him all right mut-
tered misery but the notion hit me that
mebbe hes a friend of bill williams hope
they dont forgit that bill likes his chaw of
terbacker

  gilberts physical improvement delighted
misery during the seventy miles up this
one valley he seemed to have doubled in
strength and in ability to make a camp read
signs and to find and shoot game his face
was deeply tanned and no longer daily
living in fear of mob violence his eyes were
keenly objective there remained but one
defect in him and misery repeatedly told
himself this would be speedily overcome
without the sun or stars tg guide him he had
no sense of direction

  they left the valley and rode six miles
to a small branch of the muddy gilbert
was disgusted to find the water strong of
alkali the animals drank it with reluc-
tance grass had been scarce and the horses
and mule had suffered it was miserys
plan to camp and recruit the strength of

their animals but they barely had reached
the creek before buffalo were sighted and the
mountain man gave chase after an hour
he returned in disgust his worn-out horse
being unable to carry him alongside the
shaggy creatures

   that night gilbert received the scare of
his life when an old bull stumbled upon the
camp and stampeded the horses and mule
aroused from a dreamless sleep by the
visitors blundering about gilbert heard his
companion shouting heard the crack of his
rifle and took it for granted the indians
had them

  after the bull had departed they built
a fire and looked for damage none of their
weapons had been injured and the property
loss was insignificant aside from the disap-
pearance of the horses old misery was
much disturbed but presented a cheery face
to his young friend as they sat by the blaze
and reviewed the mishap

   ill fetch em back in no time once light
comes optimistically declared the moun-
tain man he started his search before sun-
rise and before gilbert was awake found
the three strays grazing within two miles
of the camp

   traveling less than four miles after break-
fast they passed between high cliffs of red
and green clay and came out on a vast
prairie which misery informed his com-
panion stretched from the snake to the
platte then followed days of aimless wan-
dering at night misery would ask his
friend to make a map of where they had
been but only when the sky was clear
and their course had followed a general
direction was the result any more than
guess-work

  as a rule the young man retained only
fragments of recollection of narrow gulches
beaver-dams silhouettes of interminable
mountain ranges sage salt-grass ridges
covered with flat black gravel ridges be-
decked with yellow and white quartz large
bear tracks petrification of shells mys-
teriously scattered over high places and
grotesque sandstone buttes but all this
data was scrambled together in his mind
and the trivial if curious was more keenly
retained in memory than some prominent
landmark

  you aint yet come to the pint where
youre able to carry a picter in your mind
of where youve been mused the mountain
man one night


adventure

  nowhere near that point its all like
a jumble of dreams im hopeless

  not by a - sight energetically

denied misery youre doing fine dont
spect you to pick up in a season what ive
been gitting together for- fifty years now
them last big shells you see what did the
butte east of that ridge make you think of
gilberts face was blank

  i remember the shells well i remember
there were three overlapping each other
like a big fan but i dont remember any
butte

  course you wouldnt heartily cried
misery buttes everywhere every day
shells is more scurce

  yet when he went to look after the horses
his face was very grave he was keenly
disappointed but his liking for the young
man was too genuine to permit him to
abandon the task

  with a shrug of his shoulders he grimly
told himself

  but ill do it i could make a mountain
man out of bill williams ill make one
out of the younker or bust hes gitting
along fine cept he never knows where hes
going or where hes been even a bear
knows that much but what of it aint
i going to keep at his side aint i got eyes
nough for two

  he returned to the camp to find gilbert
about to set out to shoot game he re-
strained him by explaining

  were now on the war-grounds of a half
a dozen hostile tribes so we wont fire
any guns today its only bout two miles
from here that henry frappe jim bridgers
old partner was wiped out five hundred
dakotas cheyennes and rapahoes charged
his camp drove off his cattle killed a white
man two women and a injun then scat-
tered and chased his hunters and bagged
several of em

  jim was building his station on green
river and sent word for frappe to quit this
country but frappe didnt move quick
nough and was jumped by another big
band he was killed with eight of his
people but forty injuns was wiped out
are the indians as quick to attack now
as they were then inquired gilbert en-
deavoring to conceal his anxiety

  more so back in forty-one the first
immigrant train went up the platte to
oregon till then only some of us trappers
had crossed the northern plains but from

forty-one on the injuns began to under-
stand there was lots of white folks in the
world and their eyes bunged out when they
see the whites streaming across their hunt-
ing grounds wood was cut down and
wasted river bottoms grazed bare by the
stock bufler shot and left to rot on the
ground or scared out the country why
in thirty-five the oglala hunted at the
forks of the platte in forty-five they had
to travel to the laramie plains to hunt
now they have to go farther where the
shoshoni is ready to carry a fight to em

  then why do we come here just to
get killed demanded gilbert

  oh well git through with our har on
if we keep our eyes open one of my
shoshoni friends back along that was trying
to steal our hosses told me that the pawnees
just had a big fight with the cheyennes
kiowys n comanches and killed some of
their men now them three tribes is trying
to git the sioux to help em carry a pipe
against the pawnees so you see it makes
it mighty nice for us as we can slip through
the pass and take a peep at fort laramie
while them four tribes are busy smoking
war-terbacker

  you cant be a mountain man till youre
a plains man thats why im fetching you
out here its your eddication youre
going to like it too no one to boss you
round no posse to come after you you
can just look up to the old mountains every
day and tell every one to go to-

  gilbert was not entirely reassured on
the next day they rode through a beautiful
pass and the mountain man reined in and
announced they were standing on the height
of land that separates the waters of the
atlantic from those of the pacific gilberts
first feeling was of joy then he remem-
bered the red danger next he was re-
calling his sentence to exile and a great
misery filled his heart before him ex-
tended the gently undulating country slop-
ing to the east with the medicine bow
mountains in the background old misery
pointed to the range and said the platte
flowed along its base

  now dont it make you feel sorter proud
to know youve stood where the big rivers
git their start anxiously asked old misery

  at first but i cant help remembering
that i can never follow them east sadly
replied gilbert

 -and- a mountain man dont
old misery



want to foller em east fort laramie is
far nough east for us to foller any river
impatiently cried the mountain man then
more gently im bound to do it younker
im going to make a prime mountain man
out of you youre going to travel with me
and see i aint buried under ground when
im wiped out you feel a little out of sorts
now but youll git over it just think of
coming all this way from californy dont
it make you feel like youd done something
counted a big coup and oughter be named
to wear the crow in your belt dont it
make you feel like you owned the world
its fine to think about agreed gilbert
essaying to present a better face but of
course i couldnt have made three camps
if it hadnt been for you

  what of it everybody has to be
lamed i had to be now here we be
two mountain men every sky-line is free
to us let folks stew in towns back east
and on the coast let em rob n cheat n

die	we dont have any more truck with
such doings then a eagle does were free
to come and go no one can tell us where
and when to go we take what we want
we live in a country the almighty made
made for us to live in and not for men to
shovel into cricks and cover with wooden
lodges we dont need money

  there was something in this speech that
impressed gilbert as portraying a magnifi-
cent freedom if only a man could forget
his kin could forget ambition as measured
by the town forget the dark-haired walker
girl back home then that man would be
without a care or a responsibility anyway
sentence had been passed on him

  ill make a hard try for it he stoutly
declared the east is closed to me im
a fool to make myself miserable when it
cant be helped

  wakan talk wakantanka hi yol a
man comes to take a new name all he
now sees belongs to him

  and in his joy at the young mans decision
old misery slipped from his horse and exe-
cuted a little dance of triumph

  remounting he sedately announced
now well range down to fort laramie
and take a squint at the immigrant trains
making for south pass swapping their
eastern prisons of wood for western prisons
of wood mebbe well guide a train through
injun country far as fort hall sometimes
i feel i oughter do that for the women v

children mebbe well turn back to the park
mountains and see where the colorado rises
or we can cut up into the flat head country
and help the nez perces carry a pipe over
the mountains against the blackfeet i
owe the blackfeet a few digs lawd wish
i could live a million years and not have
anything changed then id have time to
hunt every crick n bufler waller every
peak n canon

  after this talk and largely because he
was convinced of the futility of fighting
against the inexorable gilbert did his best
to pick up the ways of his companion
while they were camping in a wonderful
bottom on the left bank of the north fork
of the platte he announced his desire to
shoot buffalo from the saddle heretofore
he had shot them only by stalking he felt
uplifted by the gigantic cottonwoods
towering sixty feet above their camp he
was determined to complete his education
as rapidly as possible

  old misery secretly applauded his ambi-
tion but had misgivings gilberts horse
was not trained to run buffalo nor had the
young man any experience in shooting while
at full gallop but the mountain man
would not discourage him he simply
advised

  take my hand-gun and leave your rifle
if your hoss will carry you close the hand-
gun will do the business and wont need
only one hand bimeby you can try shoot-
ing the rifle when going at a dead run

  taking the heavy revolver he rode out
to a small herd of buffalo he drew very
close before the huge animals displayed any
alarm they started off at a ponderous
gallop moving slowly at first and he had no
difficulty in maneuvering his mount along-
side a cow he held the revolver cocked
and brought it down to fire just as his horse
stumbled and all but fell his gun-hand
instinctively moved in and the weapon dis-
charged under the unintentional pressure of
the trigger finger and the horse minus the
tip of an ear reared violently and threw
him to the ground

  with the breath dashed from his lungs
he remained on his back until old misery
flogged his horse forward and in a flying
leap gained his side

  hurt bad younker bullet hit you
good- to think i let you try it

  all right gasped gilbert lost my
breath im all right and what a fool


adventure

  you done fine cried the mountain man
never see a man make a better start but

whatn - made that hoss prance so

never showed such life afore

  gilbert crawled to his feet old misery
remounted and caught the runaway now
assured his companion was not injured he
struggled mightily to keep a sober face as
he brought the horse back and rubbed some
bear-grease on the poor brutes mutilated
ear

  did i do that cried gilbert

  if you did its some the neatest closest
shooting i ever see declared the mountain
man

  now they began to find old indian stock-
ades where war-parties had camped they
left the platte to travel around an isolated
mountain on the north of medicine bow
butte old misery pointed to the narrow
opening between the two and explained that
while fremont had passed through the
gorge in  they would save time by
avoiding it so rough was the traveling

  he had scarcely finished this bit of in-
formation before he was standing in his
stirrups and shading his eyes as he stared
at the rough defile gilberts gaze quick-
ened by experience discovered it-a dot
it was emerging from the pass and was
followed by another and another until a
score had strung into view a short dis-
tance on their right was a clean open grove
of pine marking the course of a branch of
rattlesnake creek

  are they indians whispered gilbert

  yep fetching us a fight quietly re-
plied the mountain man mebbe theyll
think the risk is too much for what little
they can git

  he shifted his gaze to the pines

  well ride in there and stand em off

  youve said we should keep in the open
reminded gilbert

  thats what wed do now if i want
seeing an old injun fort in there its close
to water take your time no hurry

  but gilberts horse was the first to enter
the pines

  instead of one fort they found three and
the burned remains of a dozen more all
were built in the form of the ordinary skin
lodge and being constructed of logs stood
on end were bullet-proof old misery
dismounted and pulled back enough logs
to permit gilbert to lead the horses and
mule inside the mountain man closed the

opening except for a hole large enough for
him to crawl through  this he blocked
with their saddles and the pack from the
mule

  the horses were told to lie down and had
been taught to obey promptly it was
necessary to throw the mule however the
animals were next tied to prevent their
getting to their feet and plunging madly
about when frightened or if wounded

  the interior of the lodge measured some
eighteen feet in diameter and received its
light through various loop-holes five feet
from the ground and through an opening
at the apex

  couldnt ask for a better spot endorsed
the mountain man as he pushed a log aside
at the back and picked up a canvas bucket
and the camp-kettle

  must you go out asked gilbert

  cricks close by nothing like a drink
of water when youre choking on powder
smoke

  he crawled outside and slipped down
the bank to the stream and returned with
bucket and kettle filled to the brim

  gilbert was immensely relieved when he
saw the kettle slowly advancing through
the opening

  i was afraid theyd come while you were
gone he whispered

  lots of time itll be quite a lot of
minutes afore they come up im going out
again be right back

  this time he went to the next or middle
lodge he found it contained the remains
of a warrior resting on a low platform of
logs the man had been dead for years
the usual burial miscellany of property was
piled about the bier for weapons there
was a hudsons bay companys trade-
musket an excellent bow and a quiver of
arrows a long lance with a point of obsidian
and a trade knife in a fringed sheath
among the utensils were two large copper
kettles

  old misery placed these and the bow
and quiver outside the lodge and ran to
examine the third fort the logs of this
showed arrow and bullet marks and the
lower side was burned through weather
and flames had so weakened it that the moun-
tain man sent it crashing to the ground

  then gilbert was racing toward him rifle
in one hand and a camp-ax in the other his
eyes round and wild on beholding his
friend erect the young man explained-
old misery



  thought theyd got you

  and come out to git caught mildly
rebuked old misery but secretly pleased

  well dad i wouldnt last long if left
alone reminded gilbert lets get back
whose kettles

  ours take the bow n arrers inside
well git some more water

  and for the second time he descended the
bank to the stream

  when he returned with the extra supply
of water he remarked

  were fixed mighty fine here plenty
of grub and close to water and plenty of
lead n powder and im glad that end lodge
is down theyd be sure to take cover there
better for us if the nearest one was
down said gilbert

  thats a burial lodge theyll keep out
of that even if they aint sioux dead man
in there was a sioux hed carried the
pipe moren once as his war-bonnet tells us
how do you know he was a sioux
wrapped in a green blanket thats
their funeral color never saw a live sioux
wearing one cheyennes n rapahoes dont
seem to have any ticlar color tom tobin
would like this

  while talking he was passing from loop-
hole to loop-hole and peering out there
sounded a smart tap close to one aperture
and misery announced

  theyre here just shot a arrer into
the logs

  gilbert was immensely excited but to his
surprize did not feel afraid

  i see nothing

  keep down use the holes close to the
ground timbers full of reds they saw
us make for cover and they rode into the
growth above here

all doubt as to the indians pres-
ence was removed as a crash of guns
and chorus of hideous yelling spoiled
the quiet of the grove

  the mountain man was quick to en-
courage

  dont mind their howling hooting
never hurt any one reckon ill hoot back 
and lifting his head he sounded the war-
whoop of the pillager band of chippewas
the ancient enemy of the dakota tribes
the yelling was renewed by the besiegers
old misery grinned and explained

 knew that would make em mad
lawd but they do hate a chippewa

  when the timber became quiet again
misery said-

  reckon ill give em some more

  and he shouted defiance in the oglala
dakota tongue and repeated it in the
cheyenne arapahoe crow and pawnee
the last two raised the unseen warriors to a
pitch of frenzy

  chuckling gleefully the mountain man
hoarsely whispered

  they dont know what to think they
see only the two of us but they dont
know but what some of their own color
is in here

  that he had not deceived the besiegers
was now evidenced by a deep voice from
behind the burial lodge demanding-

  who speaks to the oglala tetons with
the tongues of many tribes but always in
the voice of a white man

  old misery glanced out on four sides of
the lodge to make sure no braves were creep-
ing close under cover of the dialog and then
answered

  a man who forgets he was bom white
a man who has a rock-medicine sent him
by tunkan he is a very brave man and
has counted many coups

  come out where we can talk with you
and smoke

  stand out where i can see you
makhpia-sha sends his voice it is
enough come out here white man

  the white man is an old man he
hunted at the forks of the platte where
red cloud was bom long before red cloud
was born life is a pair of old moccasins
to him he has lived too long he has
seen too many white men come out here and
spoil the hunting and trapping bring him
a good fight makhpia-sha so he can die
happy and take some oglala tetons to hunt
with him to the land of many lodges
was miserys answer

  and as he finished his defiance he again
made a round of the loop-holes the oglala
leader crouching behind the burial lodge
began

  there is another white man with you
is he tired of life because his people have
spoiled the hunting-ground of the dakota
old misery suddenly thrust his revolver
through a loop-hole and fired breaking the
arm of an indian who was about to tree him-
self close to the logs the wounded brave
remained behind the tree giving no sign of
being hurt leaping across the lodge the


adventure

mountain man sounded his war-cry and
taunted

  red cloud talked to keep the old man
from using his eyes red cloud forgot the
medicine sent by tunkan keeps watch for
the old man

  and shifting his position he fired two
shots at random from the front of the lodge

  gilbert who had been keeping watch on
the side where the wounded warrior was
hiding despairingly confessed

  im useless i can see nothing every
time you look you see them

  seen just one man chuckled old
misery but theyve surrounded us and
they think ive seen em when i shoot fire
a couple of shots from the back side to
keep em from sneaking up from the crick
he returned to the loop-hole facing the
burial lodge ready to resume his conversa-
tion with makhpia-sha or red cloud this
oglala man was well advanced on a career
that was to make him the most powerful
and astute chief of the oglala tetons he
came from the snake family one of the
most influential of the tribe his advance-
ment was more remarkable because he had
no claim to the chieftainship that office
among the oglalas being hereditary in the
family of tasunkakokipapi-they fear
even his horse-or as the plainsmen
called him young man afraid of his
horses

  red cloud was taking his time to con-
sider miserys repeated boast of possessing
a strong rock-medicine gilbert fired his
rifle just as the famous leader began to talk
but as if not hearing it red cloud called out
the white man lies he has no medicine
from tunkan the stone spirit does not
give medicine to white men

  the rock-medicine is in my medicine-
bag makhpia-sha is a brave man let him
come to me alone and look at it

  it is a lie if the white men come out
they will not be hurt if they do not come
out my men will set fire to the logs and roast
them if taken alive they shall be skinned
alive

  gilbert fired a second shot then shifted
his position and wasted another

  old misery laughed derisively and re-
minded red cloud

  when this fort burns makhpia-sha
then the burial lodge you are hiding behind
burns that is very bad medicine for the
oglala tetons if tunkan whose rocks are

painted red is not helping me why does red
cloud wait why does he not bring us a
fight how many warriors must he have
behind him before he dares to charge two
white men are there no strong-hearts
or crow-owners or old men of the white
horse band with him

  the shrill notes of a turkey-bone whistle
split the silence of the timber instantly
there was a deafening chorus of ferocious
cries the crash of guns and the thudding
of arrows the mule gave a convulsive
twitch and gilbert was hoarsely whispering

 mules dead dad shot through the
head

  keep low and load for me snapped the
mountain man

  and at the risk of being hit by a chance
bullet through some loop-hole he ranged
around the circle pausing a second before
each opening to peer out then quickly firing
and as he worked he repeatedly sounded
his war-cry and added many insults in the
teton dialect for ten minutes this yelling
and shooting continued and when the
whistle sounded and brought silence the
only casualty so far as the defenders knew
was the dead pack-animal

  the mountain man yelled to red cloud
by name but received no reply the silence
in the grove was more trying to gilberts
taut nerves than had been the mad howling
old misery too was accepting it as an evil
omen and began spying through the loop-
holes in an anxious endeavor to discover
what the enemy was up to

  luck or tunkan ruled that he should
be kneeling by the choked front entrance and
peering through a tiny aperture when a twig
dropped within his range of vision from a
pine ten feet from the lodge working
rapidly with his knife between two logs at
arms length above his head and talcing
great care his blde should not penetrate
to the outside he whispered for gilbert
to drop on his hand and knees before him
stepping on the young mans bowed figure
he elevated himself sufficiently to use this
new peep-hole

 twenty feet above his head a naked
warrior wag working his way out on a limb
he carried a big coil of rope and obviously
his purpose was to lasso the projecting ends
of the logs at the apex of the lodge did he
accomplish this his hidden companions could
quickly pull the timbers loose and expose
the white men to capture or quick death
old misery



   old misery pulled his revolver and
warned

  steady im going to shoot

  the indian was feeding the coil to the
ground and as it tautened the mountain
man knew the invisible foe was ready to pull
the logs apart once the noose was in place
now that his companions had hands on the
rope the man in the tree began gathering
up sufficient slack for the cast and while
doing this he dropped the noose over his
head

  as he was in the act of lifting his arm to
remove the noose the heavy bullet caught
him in the arm-pit and before the oglala
men knew what had happened and while
they were holding tightly to the rope the
man fell and was brought up with a jerk
that broke his neck his moccasins within
six inches of the ground but he was
dead before he left the limb as the upwaid
course of the bullet plowed through his
throat so unexpected was the denouement
of this ruse that those holding the rope kept
the dead man suspended for nearly a min-
ute his naked form whirling rapidly a
horribly grotesque teetotum

  back to the loop-hole facing the burial
lodge leaped the mountain man and loudly
derided

  how many winters since the oglala
tetons hung their dead up by the neck
has makhpia-sha a new medicine that tells
him to do it

  then he was crouching behind the saddles
and pack at the entrance the dead man
was on the ground the whistle sounded
and there came a hail of lead and a flight of
arrows and under cover of this assault a
brave reached from behind the tree seized
the dead mans foot and commenced drag-
ging him away he desisted and retired
with a shattered wrist

  old misery again hurled defiances and
mountain abuse

  gilbert screamed-

  look out

  misery wheeled just as the young man
kicked a gun barrel thrust through a loop-
hole on the creek side of the lodge the
gun discharged the bullet harmlessly plow-
ing into the logs above the prostrate horses
as the man yanked the gun back gilbert
fired his rifle through the opening he was
too excited to hear the sound of a heavy
body falling but old misery heard it and
he leaped across the enclosure pushed the

young man aside and was in time to see the
dead brave being dragged to cover

 -and- you counted a coup

roared the mountain man youll wear a
war-bonnet yet make you a prime moun-
tain man why already youre almost a
second jim bridger mebbe sometime youll
be almost as good a man as i be quick
work good work some new medicine is
working for you he hi hi hi

  and he proceeded to arouse the savages
outside to a maniacal pitch of fury by sing-
ing a war-song of the mississippi band of
the chippewa

   i make him bite the dust the teton
sioux when i see him  he repeated in
english for gilberts benefit

  he howled this arrogantly over and over
but as he sang he did not neglect the loop-
holes and kept moving around the enclosure

  although at first stunned by his unex-
pected victory gilbert suddenly discovered
his heart was filled with strength and cour-
age knowing no indian songs he burst
into a violent denunciation in english his
fresh strong voice carrying far old misery
was overjoyed by this metamorphosis in
the young man the flushed face the
sparkling eyes the confident volume of
the ringing voice erased all doubt in the
mountain mans mind the vermonter had
found himself under some mountain name
his fame would travel far when gilbert
paused to renew his breath misery was
impelled to shuffle around in a chippewa
war-dance punctuating his grotesquery with
an exclamatory

  howl howi

  the shrill whistle sounded again the
mountain man believed the last climax was
upon them and jumped to a loop-hole all
remained quiet outside he examined the
timber from all sides at last he proudly
informed gilbert

  theyre drawing back to powwow
younker youll be a crow-owner for this
days work keep on and youll figger in
one of their winter counts

  i never supposed i would ever kill a man
muttered gilbert a slight reaction setting in

  old misery feared weakness and harshly
corrected him

  you say it wrong you killed a wild
animal that was trying to hoop your har
after skinning you alive and its a mighty
big coup to make makhpia-sha draw back
and go into council


adventure

  but there are so many of them they
can easily rush us and tear these logs apart
old misery grinned and agreed easiest
thing in the world but they aint done it
theyve had two men killed and a couple
wounded thats bad for em its bad
for red cloud their leader they planned
to git us without losing a man now red
cloud is maddern an old bufler bull thats
been driven out of the herd but hes a
injun he wont let his mad git the best
of his red mind theyll talk it over and
think up some new tricks mebbe theyll
lose some more men but they wont plan to
they wont rush us in daylight red cloud
knows he mustnt lose another man now
lets drink some water

  if they dont get us today they will
tonight

  they aint going to git us alive any
time cheerfully assured old misery if
they come in the dark itll be along toward
sun up we may git a chance to sneak
away afore then may have to leave the
hosses you start moving round and peek-
ing out dont stop moren a second at
any hole i must talk with my medicine
gilbert began spying on the outside world
and saw nothing but two squirrels scamper-
ing madly down one tree to cross and ascend
another old misery seated himself with
his back to the logs opened his buckskin
bag and stared earnestly at the rock then
he held it to his ear

  the mans gone you shot out of the
tree whispered gilbert

  the sly cusses absent-mindedly mur-
mured misery

  what does your medicine tell you

  in his desperation the young vermonter
was eager to try to believe a curious piece
of rock possessed magic powers

  old misery listened intently then
frowned slightly

  dont git it just clear but thats cause
my head is slow as i make it out were
to bust away from this trap that must
mean we oughter make a try after sun-
down ill make two packs from the mule-
load what we cant carry well leave to
pay for the dead men

suspecting some new ruse the
two watched with ears and eyes but
there was no sign of life in the tim-
ber after twenty minutes of tense waiting
there came a sharp yelping more like the

cry of a dog than a human at first it was
faint and far off but rapidly increased in
clearness and volume from the edge of
the timber the assembled indians began
shouting back the red sentinels left posted
around the lodge caught the contagion
and from their hiding-places added high-
pitched explosive cries to the general
tumult

  what does it mean whispered gilbert

  some one on hossback comes with a talk
for red cloud knew bout where to find
him shows hes one of the band ex-
plained old misery

  the newcomer had now reached the circle
of indians gathered in a war-council and
the howling ceased

  hes giving his talk muttered old
misery

  an outburst of wild howls told the white
men the talk was finished the whistle-
signal pierced the grove

  the mountain man cried

  something bigs busted loose theyll
be leaving soon they wont make moren
one rush at us keep your head

  the sentinels began firing on the lodge
inside half a minute the entire red force
was discharging bullets and arrows at the
logs the whistle again commanded and
the firing ceased old misery watched
closely from a loop-hole beside the blocked
entrance he had a glimpse of a sentinel
retreating through the trees and toward the
open country on the west of the timber
he saved his bullet and told gilbert

  untie the hosses and git em up some-
thing bigs happened mebbe its war-talk
about the pawnees theyre all leaving

  its some trick muttered gilbert not
daring to indulge in such an extravagant
hope

  he got the horses up and was ashamed
to find his limbs trembling violently

  from the edge of the timber rose the
voice of the red men singing a war-song
it gradually receded and the mountain man
knew they had taken to horse and were
riding away gilbert insisted it was a trick
to induce them to break cover

  old misery shook his head and reminded
gilbert

  a man rode up yelping like he had a big
talk they may a left a few braves to
take a shot at us when we show our noses
but my medicine says we wont have no
more trouble from red cloud something
old misery



the medicine tries to tell me i cant make
out well wait a bit

  half an hour passed and brought no new
alarms the horses shared the mule-pack
between them gilbert was for throwing
away a heavy buckskin bag tied in the
middle that misery had said contained
lead the mountain man insisted they
might need it

  time enough to heave it away when
were jumped and have to ride bareback for
it well have to leave the saddles of
course

  he was not quile ready to depart how-
ever and directed gilbert to remain inside
with his rifle ready

  im going to take a two-minute scout
he explained

  and before his young friend could remon-
strate he had yanked a saddle from the
opening and had squirmed out of the lodge
inside the two minutes he was back walk-
ing boldly and calling for gilbert to remove
two logs and drive out the horses

  theyve gone north toward the immi-
grant road have a sixty-mile ride ahead
of em must a had word from some of
their scouts that a big train is coming red
clouds got to wipe out some whites to
make up for his two men killed the
skunks packed the dead men way with em
so we aint no har to show for our fight i
was going to show you how to sculp

  but i dont want to learn cried gilbert
  misery was disappointed

  as a mountain man youve got to know
how he insisted

  then more cheerfully

  mebbe well git a chance to bag one of
em afore we reach fort laramie tricks
easy n simple

  i pray we meet no more indians said
gilbert with a shiver

  the mountain man would have resented
this had he not remembered the vague mes-
sage his medicine had endeavored to tell
his gaze grew somber with fear as he looked
at his companion

  mebbe its best that way he muttered

they crossed the creek and cov-
 ered twenty miles before making
camp in the dark gilbert gladly
would have attempted to walk another
twenty but misery assured him they could
not outwalk danger but might walk into
it their course had taken them up a dry

branch of the rattlesnake that headed in a
low gap from the gap they had followed
down a hollow to a small tributary of the
medicine bow river that headed near the
northern end of the medicine bow butte

  starting before sunrise they took a south-
easterly course with the country much more
pleasing than what they had left behind
on the west side of the medicine bow moun-
tains the valleys were wide and richly
grassed and were hemmed in by low
rounded hills antelope in graceful flight
passed back and forth near them the
grass-covered hills swarmed with buffalo
they camped early in the midst of some
willows cottonwoods and aspen were close
by and the tiny stream was lined with rose-
bushes

  the days travel had been short gilbert
was for covering many miles but the moun-
tain man appeared to be preoccupied it
was fear of what his medicine had tried to
tell him he tried to keep it from his
thoughts but was remembering it each time
he glanced at his companion

  two hours before sunrise they ate emer-
gency rations of dried meat and ascended
a high bluff in the northeast and beyond
the laramie plains rose laramies peak
dark and mysterious against the early morn-
ing sky gilbert was confused as to direc-
tion until the red glow of the hidden sun
had burned a hole in the eastern skyline
the traveling was easy as they were passing
through an open rolling country old
misery explained that the great abundance
of game was due to the remoteness of the
immigrant road the buffalo were quite
tame the old bulls refusing to move the
antelope were more curious than timid

  misery refused to eat antelope so long
as he could have buffalo he shot a fat
cow and butchered it mountain style
taking only the bass and tongue the
former was the hump projecting from the
back of the neck and about the size of a
mans head it was removed with the skin
attached misery assured his companion
that once the bass was boiled it would prove
to be very tender and rich and most nutri-
tious they crossed the east fork of
frappes creek and camped early in the
mile-wide bottom old misery informed
gilbert

  named after frappe when the rickaras
stole sixty of his horses at the mouth of the
crick


adventure

  this information made gilbert nervous
until his companion explained frappe was
robbed years before

  now were clear of the rattlesnake
country we wont hurry added misery
might run into another band of injuns
id struck north to the immigrant road if
red cloud hadnt gone that way well
have to dodge some hunting parties most
likely but im proud of you younker
youre going to be a big mountain man

  had it not been for fear of roving indians
gilbert would have enjoyed the next few
days they moved cautiously and each
day traveled eight or ten miles before sun-
rise one day when it rained they put in
twelve hours of almost continuous walking
at each camp old misery would produce
his medicine-rock and consult it and each
time vainly endeavored to understand what
it was trying to tell him

  so far as he could understand he learned
nothing to dismiss his secret fear he told
none of his thoughts to gilbert however
on leaving frappes creek they had entered
the laramie plains and traveled a score of
miles across a beautiful rolling country to
camp on the west fork of the laramie river

  old misery was doubly cautious saying

  probably some injun villages down the
river but that dont mean all the reds we
meet will hanker for our har not even if
theyre oglalas

  gilbert found no consolation in this talk
yet they met with no trouble and rounded
the black hills range but directed their
course outside of cheyenne pass-a valley
rather than a gorge and so called as it
contained a cheyenne village they had
often seen red hunters at a distance but
thus far had escaped discovery it was
after they left the chugwater and were
striking direct for fort laramie that they
ran into a small band of cheyennes all
indians looked alike to gilbert but old
misery assured him there was no danger
and he called by name the leader of the
hunters a man of some sixty years

  the leader was pleased to meet with an
old acquaintance and shook hands with
both white men and told his followers they
were good men the young men how-
ever eyed the two horses and their packs
hungrily old misery informed them that
several war-bands of strange indians were
south and west of the black hills the
cheyennes at once became nervous and

anxiously asked what tribes were sending out
war-bands the mountain man repeated
they were strange indians but he was
sure one band was composed of pawnees
the cheyennes mounted at once and gal-
loped to the chugwater and their village
at its head

  on the next day and before gilbert was
prepared to receive the heartening informa-
tion old misery was announcing

  afore night well be camping just above
laramie you act sprized

  ive been mixed up as to the direction
weve traveled and as to the distance weve
covered said gilbert

  misery felt misgivings but ousted the
thought and explained

  used to be called fort john used to
be used by merican trading company to
protect its trade you still low youll be
a mountain man

  and he anxiously waited to hear the
answer

  why dad what else is there for me
to do morosely replied gilbert ill
do my best im afraid i never can get
to know where im at but ill do my
best

the land around fort laramie im-
pressed gilbert as being very sterile
the absence of dews and the dry
atmosphere turned the occasional patches
of grass brown as if they had been burned
over much of the surrounding country was
carpeted with gravel the fort itself built
of adobe brick and occupying a natural shelf
of clay and rock was a most welcome sight
to the easterner this largely because the
stars and stripes were fluttering from the
top of a bastion

  old misery led the way a short distance
above the fort to a spot on laramie fork
and announced they would camp there to
be clear of the sun and the dust from pass-
ing wagon-trains he was very quiet as he
cooked the mid-day meal and while he
smoked his pipe he turned aside peered
into the medicine-bag and frowned as if
not understanding about mid-afternoon
clouds of dust advertised the coming of a
big wagon-train

  observing how wistfully his friend was
watching the sun-riddled dust misery
remarked

  its coming from the oregon country
mighty soon well be going up where it

l
old misery

h

started from big trees big mountains
big lakes air cool and make you
sleep bettern a gallon o missouri whisky
lawdy but if i could be young and be
seeing that country for the first time again
waugh

  and how youre going to take to it
no pindling timber like what you see down
here no burned-out grass no dry crick
beds but good water n grass n fire-wood
everywhere and game youll go plumb
heyoka when you see the game and catch
the fish

  he spoke with boisterous anticipation
but his shrewd old eyes were ever watching
the wo-begone face across the tiny fire

  thatll be smash-up good fun huh

  ill be glad to be with you dad youve
been mighty good to me but i almost wish
we hadnt come here i mustnt go near the
fort some word may have reached here
about me and to see that train pulling
out for the east would make me feel awfully
cheap and homesick- well well its
settled and im a fool to be complaining
im mighty lucky to have some one to look
out for me

  ill make a mountain man out of you
yet growled old misery hi he he
he there i feel a heap better go to the
fort youre a mountain man you can

go anywhere you--please come along

folks round here dont know nor care
nothin bout any stranger soldiers have
all they can do to look out for injuns and
git the hay down eight miles from up the
river well look at that train keep look-
ing at em till you laff at the notion of ever
wanting to foller one to the east mebbe
some old cusses i know is with that train
hired to come along to help stand off the
injuns well catch up with a west-bound
train and take life easy

  they reached the fort ahead of the long
train and when it came in it attracted the
attention of soldiers officers guides and
groups of indians lounging about the place
in the tops and sides of several wagons war-
arrows were flopping there were fresh
scars from bullets and arrow heads on the
wagon bodies and several horses were
wounded

  ahead of the foremost wagon mounted
on a raw-boned horse of wicked eye rode a
man with a face of leather and with gray
hair that came down on his shoulders he
gave old misery one look and then slipped

from his crude wooden saddle yelling like
a comanche and playfully tried to knock
the mountain mans ragged hat off with a
sweep of a rifle barrel

  misery grinned in keen delight and in
ducking the blow scooped up a handful of
gravel and tossed it into the weathered
face

  -your old hide misery if it aint

you wait till i git rid of this dirt from
my eyes and ill climb you big beaver
but im glad to see you whos the young
buckskin i see just before you put my eyes
out

  partner of mine ned killed his injun
up on the rattlesnake when they had us
cornered i wouldnt be here if it want for
his gun hes going to be the rip-snortingest
mountain man you ever see hes going up
oregon way with me we hoofed it alone
from frisco way here fighting every inch
of the way left a trail of dead injuns
fifteen feet wide wiped out thirty outlaws
this side the sierra had so many dry
sculps we used em for wood for cooking
our kettle when wood want handy

  you old liar you fight injuns youd
never come east if the digger injuns hadnt
took sticks and driv you away younkers
all right hell make a good mountain
man but hes tying up with a mighty weak
partner heard you was in califomy from
tom tobin hes at fort hall dropped
a word that he had a grudge to settle with
you

  tom tobin at fort hall exclaimed
old misery his eyes lighting the little
lying runt

  yep spent a night at our camp said
you bit him down in californy

  the-little runt if i ever bit him

he wouldnt have any head on his shoulders
my teeth slipped just as i was going to give
my war-hoot but i promised him a scrim-
mage next time we met you go back with
us and watch the fun im a wolf from my
shoulders up and a grizzly bar sierra kind
from my shoulders down

  ned shook his head sadly

  ive got to go through with this outfit
as far as fort kearney im home-sick
already remember the time i saved your
har for you at the three tetons you save
that fuss till i git back

  saved my har you ongrateful liar and
me packing you out the injun country on
my back couldnt even bring a big train


adventure

down here without letting injuns shoot
arrers through it

  red clouds band jumped us got two
of our men we bagged three of em that
i see knocked dead

  and me and this younker stood off his
whole outfit and killed seven and wounded
a dozen

  and he turned to gilbert to have him
vouch for the figures but the vermonter
had heard little if any of their talk he was
staring at the train misery broke in on
his reverie by saying

  this is the train that pulled us out of
that mess younker red cloud quit us to
tackle it if youve got nough of the fort
well start up the trail today and make a
dozen miles afore camping ill git fresh
hosses and a pack-mule and plenty of grub
and powder

  gilbert bowed his head on his hands
fortunately old miserys mountain friend
had turned back to the wagons and did not
witness this weakness

  my- whats hitting you gasped

old misery

  im no good dad dont mind me just
now ill be all right in a minute i wont
break down again- its that train- its
going east- it got me before i could guard
against it but ill toughen up i wont
act the fool again

  old misery dropped beside him and began
pulling up tie few blades of grass showing
through the gravelly sand

  youd go back home give up being a
mountain man and go back if it want for
that bit of trouble he huskily mumbled

  oh but i would i wish i could go and
take you with me

 not by a - sight anything but

that young buckskin thats the new
name theyd give you if youd come with
me- then bimeby old buckskin- all
plain now- back in the fort on the rattle-
snake my medicine bothered me told me
things i didnt dast tell you- all the way
down here it was telling the same thing
i didnt git the sabe of it sounded heyoka
less i figgered it one way kept saying in
the lodge that wed git clear but that id
lose you thats been bearing down on my
old neck ever since we struck out for this
place

  thats why i made long travels n short
travels and started long afore sunup and
walked after dark and come in here by a

roundabout way i believed my rock-
medicine meant you was to be rubbed
out and all the time it was saying youd
be rubbed out of my life but not the way
id figgered

  i dont understand you numbly remon-
strated gilbert i am here well start
for oregon after this train gets under way
i probably wont feel this way when we
see the next one

  tunkan is right his medicine never
lies sorrowfully continued old misery
youve got guts but they aint mountain
guts youve lived too long in the east
where they believe in double-time if i
could a caught you younger- well thats
all ended

  youre wishing to go back alone i
dont blame you muttered gilbert trying
to conceal the shock the mountain mans
speech had given him

  neds wagon-train will take you back
east dragoons will go with it to kearney
you know i can never go back east
but thats no reason why i should be a
drag on you maybe i can get work here
at the fort they need men for cutting
hay and firewood or i can get a job
teaming

  old misery pulled out the bag containing
his medicine-rock and from the bottom of it
extracted a worn and soiled piece of paper
and explained

  heres a writing saved it to give to you
if you didnt pan out as a mountain man
i got it from a long cuss outside of coloma
men called him elnathan plumb i give
him nough gold to make up for what that
young streak of scarlet got away from you
i told him you started for coloma from
frisco with the money and was held up and
robbed by reelfoot williams and was
wounded a bit i splained how i ran across
williams and made him fork over nough
dust to square the money so everythings
all hunky back east now you git on your
feet and foller me

  with the precious paper clutched in his
hand and his mouth agape the dazed ver-
monter followed misery to their camping
place from under the blankets the old
man produced the bag tied in the middle
he dropped it at gilberts feet saying
thats the lead you wanted to heave

away - of a tussle to fetch it way

from snake martins camp he had it
buried and i got it its yours twenty
checkmate



thousand odd in dust n nuggets buy a
trading-store or a ranch and marry that
home-squaw

 you knew all the time i might

weaken-

  rub it in im onary n low-down
lived with the crows too long mebbe
but there was a chance youd pan out a
prime mountain man and like it but i
didnt go to play you dirt younker

 good - paid up my stealings

planned to give me a fortune dad if i
leave you im always going to feel mighty

bad if i stay-

  he paused and his gaze swung back to-
ward the fort and his thoughts leaped to
far-off vermont and the dark-haired walker
girl for several minutes he remained mo-
tionless and silent his eyes beholding the
green-forested amiable hills of home the
placid propriety of the village streets and

a dark-haired girl standing by an ancient
gate-waiting and when he finally turned
back to announce his decision he found he
was alone

the dust clouds followed the long
wagon-train traveling under armed
escort down the north fork of the
platte the big medicine road of the
white men

  from a ridge old misery stood beside his
horse and stared after it

  lawd but i hated to let him go lawd
but i hated to send him home- took
care of me- felt of my old head to see if
i was sick- lawd but i feel sorter lone-
some- wonder if the mountains ever feel
lonesome well thats ended that rock-

medicine is - strong- and theres

that tobin runt waiting for me- said i
bit him

         hus your trip has been a vain
         one i fear mohamed

          such things must be as
allah wills replied mohamed
ali quietly at least i have again seen
a friend

mohamed ali sat cross-legged upon a
great cushion in a house in tangier and

 checkmate copyright  by george e holt

 

 beside him squatted his good friend hadj
 drees a low octagonal gaily-painted
 table stood before them upon it were
 little cups and a green pottery teapot into
 which hadj drees had just put boiling
 water a handful of green tea a ragged chunk
 of sugar and three sprigs of fresh mint

 at the risk of his head mohamed ali
 had left the safety of the riffian hills and


adventure

had made cautious way alone and by night
to the little iron-studded doorway of hadj
drees house in tangier behind this door
his friend had lain in the slumber of the
just from these slumbers at the first
gray hint of dawn he had been roused by
the resonant knock of the big iron ring upon
the door to open the portal to stare sleepily
for a moment at the smiling brown face
then to drag mohamed ah hurriedly inside
and to bolt the door securely

  now mohamed ali had not traveled
away from his hills for pleasure but upon
business of importance when he had been
basha of tangier and the news had come
from his ancient friend and patron the
vizier baghdadi that his enemies were
about to descend upon him mohamed
alis departure from his office and residence
and the city of tangier alike had necessarily
been hurried as also had been that of his
staff including his first secretary or scribe
in whose hands he had placed for safe-
keeping a package of valuable official docu-
ments many months had passed but not
until the preceding day had he received
word that the scribe might be found in
tangier wherefore being a man of
prompt action mohamed ali had im-
mediately resolved upon seeking him
rather than risk divulging the location of his
own haven

  but it was now past mid-day and mo-
hamed ali had learned that his mission had
failed his scribe was in jail in tangier
and was so confined that communication
with him for the present at least was out
of the question the reigning basha ap-
peared to know that the scribe was worth
guarding wherefore mohamed ali drank
many little cupfuls of tea and awaited the
coming of another night to cloak his return
to the hills there he would give his full
attention to the matter of securing the re-
lease of his scribe the affair would take
both thought and time and mohamed ali
felt a certain reticence in exposing his friend
hadj drees more than was necessary to the
danger caused by the presence of an outlaw
in his house

  but even as mohamed ali reflected upon
this matter the iron ring on the door of
hadj drees house again voiced its sum-
mons staying a servant with up-lifted
hand hadj drees himself went to open the
door it seemed policy under the circum-
stances he found a very small and very

  brown and very dirty urchin whose single
garment was a ragged gray djellaba who
repeated the name of hadj drees presented
him with a many-folded paper and ran
swiftly away paying no attention to the
callings of the master of the house hadj
drees closed and re-locked the door and re-
turned to his seat upon the cushions beside
mohamed ali there he examined the
paper grunted expressively and handed it to
the outlaw mohamed alis name was
plainly inscribed upon the outside in
hadj drees clear old eyes as he watched his
friend there was combined a flicker of
amusement with a tinge of concern

  mohamed ali read his name twice aloud
the first time it came as an expression of
astonishment the second time it contained
another note-neither of fear nor anger nor
disgust but a little of all three emotions
then with strong brown fingers he unfolded
the paper and his eyes raced through the
few lines of arabic script the sanded ink
was scarcely dry

  humph said mohamed ali then
humph again djinnoon i read

   in the name of allah the merciful from the
master of the djinnoon to mohamed ali vizier-to-
be greetings if mohamed ah would learn of a
certain french affair with which his name is to be
unfavorably connected he will do well to be at the
shrine of mulai yacoub at sunset

  thus it says friend drees and no more
and yet that little would seem to be
enough

 who-and how-

  and why also mohamed ali inter-
rupted him you know this man who calls
himself the master of the djinnoon

   i have heard tales that is all replied
hadj drees like all magicians he has
the veneration i believe of the unthinking
moors-and entertains for a consideration
the foreigners

  nevertheless said mohamed ali i
am inclined to think that he is more than he
appears to be the fact that he knew i was
here would seem to confirm that belief
besides which-you remember hadj
hosein

  he who was found dead one morning
with no mark upon him in the street of the
mosque aiwa i remember

  i came to tangier at that time disguised
as a beggar to secure by whatever means
offered a certain letter which was in the
hands of hadj hosein it was at night a
checkmate



voice whispered my name from the shadows
in the street i found the source of the
whisper and to make matters clear went
with the whisperer to his house there i
fought against the little lightnings that
play in the eyes of this black magician who
calls himself master of the djinnoon and
witnessed strange matters

  hadj hosein was one time known as
hadj larbi ben-susa and lived in marraksh
there he wronged the sister of this man
who now claims kingship over spirits
good and evil my purpose-my desire
to secure this letter from hadj hosein-
was known to the black also other
matters which need not be mentioned
to his house came hadj hosein and the
black claimed that his spirits had brought
him however that may be he came and
became as a witless one beneath the eyes
of the master of the djinnoon gave him
the letter i sought and at command
went forth into the night-to find shrieking
death in the deep shadow where the black
had told him he would find it

  ai ai ai hadj drees eyes stared
into those of mohamed ali

 as allah is my witness so an-
swered the outlaw to the look of amazement
and question wherefore-

  wherefore at least this message must
not be ignored

 besides which went on mohamed
ali while i do not admit his claims with
respect to the djinnoon i think that he may
be a person of considerably more importance
than a black magician he deals with
matters as you observe which are scarcely
within the province of a master of tricks
wherefore-as i have no desire for these
scurvy frenchmen to misuse the name of
mohamed ali in which i have some pride-
i shall see what occurs at the shrine of
mulai yacoub at sunset

  but there is also another side to this
matter i do not think-i do not think
that it is entirely out of consideration for
mohamed ali that the master of the djin-
noon thus sends me warning on the
contrary i suspect that it is an offer to
let me play a part in some game of his
own if that game be against the foreigner
the part may be worth the playing how-
ever my scribe lies in the tangier casbah
and i desire his release let us therefore-
have you pen and paper-let us send an
acknowledgement of this message to the

black magician-to be delivered when i
am on my way to the shrine of mulai
yacoub

  you do not fear a trap mohamed ali
asked hadj drees you do not fear
what you may find at the shrine at sunset

  he offered paper and ink and bamboo
pen as he spoke

  humph said mohamed ali preparing
to write humph i always fear a
trap-or at least i consider the possibility
of a trap having been set thus i write

  from mohamed ali to the master of the
djinnoon those who play with the name of
mohamed ali do so at their own risk my former
scribe mamun el-merwani is a prisoner in the
casbah of tangier he could be of service to me
were he at liberty and he who secured his liberty
would have the gratitude of mohamed ali

  he sanded the ink folded the paper and
addressed it to the master of the djinnoon

  it is sometimes difficult to distinguish
between the possible and the probable
he said and his friend nodded slow un-
derstanding

the shrine of mulai yacoub is
a small white cube topped by an
eight-sided dome and it stands in
a little olive grove at the end of a path
which runs away from the tetwan road
at a point perhaps eight miles from tangier
although so near the city it is beyond the
wad-el-halk the tidal river which cuts
into the crescent of the bay about at its
middle beyond the line of gray-brown
stony hills which here march down to
the waters edge-beyond the watchful
eye of that western twentieth century
baghdad tangier

  it is one of a thousand little shrines of
holy men scattered about the country and
like most of them is visited infrequently
save by people living in the immediate
vicinity-country wives who wish sons
country girls who wish husbands country
men who wish favors from allah for crops
or cattle and the ancient custodian of
this shrine a bent gray-bearded man was
the cousin of mohamed alis father

  an hour before sunset a hooded figure
in a brown djellaba shuffled along the path
to the shrine the hood of his djellaba
was drawn low over his face and his neck
and chin were buried in a voluminous
bandage obviously a turban-cloth the
traveler knocked thrice upon the door of


adventure

the shrine and entered without waiting
for a reply to his summons the old cus-
todian rose from a pallet of straw in sur-
prize-a surprize which when the visitor
threw back his hood changed to curiosity
and a little fear

  mohammed ali explained his desires
in fifty swift words and with a shrug and
a mutter of understanding the ancient
returned to his couch mohamed ali
knowing that he must wait for darkness
made himself comfortable watching the
little square of sunlight from the solitary
tiny window climbing up the eastern wall
of the shrine

  at last it came to rest paused and began
to fade the interior of the little shrine
waxed gray the custodian slept with the
easy sleep of the aged mohamed ali
rose and took position at the little window
the shadows deepened quickly and spread
like blots of ink from the hillsides to the
valley

  soon his vigil was rewarded his keen
ears heard the patter of a horses hoofs
upon the road some one was approach-
ing from the direction of tetwan a horse-
man rode past the shrine and perhaps a
hundred paces further there mohamed
ali heard the noises which announce a
riders dismounting scarcely had this
occurred when it was repeated by one who
came from the west from the direction
of tangier and shortly after the last
comer had passed the shrine mohamed
ali followed cautiously in the darkness
and in the darkness behind a gnarled
olive tree not ten feet from the riders he
heard most interesting affairs discussed

  half an hour later one of the riders was
pounding the road back to tangier and
the other was going with equal speed
towards tetwan mohamed ali sought
his horse where he had hidden it and set
out for his haven in the mountains there
he summoned twenty of his followers and
addressed them at length

  now there is no more peaceful village
in anghera than a certain little settlement
which calls itself el-menar it sits on a
quiet hill-top across the bay from tangier
and its people are children it was there-
fore a matter which should have caused
surprize when on the following day there
began to arrive within its walls of cactus
and prickly-pear brown men who carried
beneath their brown djellabas high-pow-

ered rifles of which the blue finish had not
yet become worn by ones and twos they
came greeted the head-man of the village
and were promptly led by him into a cer-
tain house wherein sat mohamed ali
by one and two they came and disap-
peared into the house sunset saw a score
arrived

  but aside from a little extra activity in
the cooking-quarters of the women where
many big bowls of kesksoo were being
prepared there was nothing to indicate
that anything unusual was in progress
and even after the kesksoo bowls had been
scraped clean by brown fingers and moha-
med ali had personally posted his men
where he desired them to be there was no
mark upon the village save that of the
tranquillity of night

  wherefore kaid mahalli head-man of a
settlement of ill-repute which lay some ten
miles to the east leading a score of his
ruffians quietly up the path to the village
of el-menar smiled contentedly to himself
at the mental vision of what that village
would look like very shortly the head-
man had a good imagination-a fact that
was not to be a source of unqualified plea-
sure to him a little later had he been more
acute he might have noted the absence
of the inevitable village dogs which should
have given warning of his approach he
reached the top of the hill and gathered his
men about him in the little open space
inside the cactus walls-gathered them for
a pounce upon the tranquil village which
he had been paid to destroy a few yellow
lights marked doors or windows of con-
tented thatch-roofed houses-fuel await-
ing the torch-and the stars gave light
enough to make black shadows all about

  ready then said kaid mahalli and
started forward

  three steps he took then from the
shadows emerged a circle of men twenty
rifles covered kaid mahalli and his fol-
lowers and into the belt of the kaid
himself the muzzle of a pistol was being
pushed by a big man whose face was not
visible but whose chuckles were audible
enough beginning with the head-man
the night visitors passed the big man one
by one leaving their rifles at his feet and
were received by a reception-committee
waiting just beyond and as the last one
dropped his gun the first one was already
bound and gagged and lying in one of the
checkmate



little thatch-roofed houses where a yellow
light burned

  this matter having been attended to
mohamed ali gathered his men together
and led them down the path to the foot of
the hill where behind great boulders they
squatted like shadows suddenly from
the village there came the noise of shots
and shouts and then red and yellow
flames flared up mohamed ali squatting
behind a rock pistol in hand chuckled
again it is always pleasing for a maker of
plays to see the products of his imagination
become realized upon the stage

  that observed mohamed ali to him-
self should bring them speedily

  and on the tail of his words came a
sound from the west-the sound of military
brogans marching over a rocky road and
the sharper note of a horses hoofs the
sound grew louder and more variegated-
the creak of leather the click of metal
against metal the subdued coughing of
men then into the defile guarded by
mohamed ali and his twenty rifles rode a
french-algerian police officer followed by
a dozen native police a hand reached up
suddenly and dragged the officer from his
horse into the arms of mohamed ali
and in unpleasant contact with the muzzle
of mohamed alis pistol at the same
moment the officers men each looking
into the small end of a rifle realized that
working for the french had its disadvan-
tages they were quick to understand
to drop their guns and to permit their
pistols to be taken from their holsters
without opposition and shortly there-
after they also bound and gagged lay
helpless in a little thatch-roofed hut in the
village above mohamed ali the fowler
had filled his nets to overflowing

but in order that the affair might
have its proper fruition-in order
to teach that mohamed alis name
should not be connected with the political
outrages of the french-mohamed ali
still had work to do and the first of his
steps was to send swiftly to tangier one
of his own men clothed in the distinctive
yellow trousers red coat and crimson fez
of the native french police alarbi his
name was and to the french minister in
tangier alarbi carried the simple message
that all was as had been planned

  now this message which was very

satisfactory to the french minister did
not mean that in a little thatch-roofed
cottage in el-menar twenty ruffians headed
by kaid mahalli lay bound and gagged
nor that a french-algerian police officer
with his twelve men lay in the same con-
dition in a similar hut-because that had
not been the plan at all no to his ex-
cellency monsieur le ministre the message
brought by alarbi meant this kaid mahalli
and his followers for a proper considera-
tion had attacked the village of el-menar
set the torch to its thatched roofs killed
a few of its inhabitants and driven off its
stock-thus proving to the entire diplo-
matic world that so long as mohamed ali
was at liberty such things would happen
and also evidencing to this same world
the sultans inability to preserve order
in the country it would be made the
basis of very striking publicity

  furthermore the message meant to
his excellency that a certain french-al-
gerian lieutenant of police with his men
had fortunately been in the vicinity heard
the shots witnessed the conflagration and
had speedily gone to the succor of the out-
raged village and had driven away mo-
hamed ali and his gang of outlaws this
in turn would be the best of evidence as to
the efficiency of the french police it would
emphasize the necessity-and this was
the guts of the matter-for the establish-
ment of a strong police or military bar-
racks in anghera for under a certain
provision of the act of algeciras the
french had the duty of maintaining order
in morocco

  these are the important things which the
simple message of alarbi meant to his
excellency the french minister where-
fore his first official act on the following
day was to call upon the old and wise
naib the sultans representative in tan-
gier sid mohamed torres a blue-veined
waxen-faced white-bearded old aristocrat
whose blue eyes for twenty years had
watched foreign intrigue for possession of
his native land

  wherefore concluded the french min-
ister after having stated the facts as he
believed them to be wherefore sid
mohamed it is manifestly obvious that a
french military barracks be established in
anghera immediately

  there was no twinkle no hint of greater
wisdom no suspicion of guile in the watery


adventure

ocean-blue eyes of the sultans representa-
tive he held up a gentle hand white and
indigo-veined and in that motion was
gathered the essence of the slow-moving
east

  first your excellency he said i
think it would be wise for us to observe
the situation in person we must have
order yes you are quite right we must
have order it will not do at all to permit
such things to take place wherefore-i
am an old man but the road is not
long let us ride to el-menar and see
with our own eyes that which has taken
place

  there was no reason for the french
minister to oppose this on the contrary
he welcomed the suggestion it gave him
an opportunity to demonstrate to the naib
just what terrible things would continue
to happen unless the hand of france was
called upon for aid

  thus the mid-day sun saw the venerable
sid mohamed torres and his excellency
the french minister attended only by
two riders reining in their animals on the
hill-top where lay the settlement of el-
menar the sultans representative looked
with calm blue eyes at a tranquil village
no blackened ruins no scene of desolation
and death lay before them-only a peaceful
thatch-roofed village with children playing
about the doorways chickens scratching
industriously for what they might encounter
a cow taking its lazy way along a path and
a group of men smoking lazily around an
old village patriarch whose gnarled fingers
wove palmetto leaves into rope

  now the blue eyes of sid mohamed
torres sought the face of the french minis-
ter and found it frowning set and a little
green without comment the old man
urged his white mule onward and rode
slowly through the village followed by the
french envoy the smoking men rose
quickly to greet the naib-to kiss his
flowing white ksa and to stand about
bashfully after they had done so

  all is tranquil here

  it was a statement rather than a ques-
tion from the naib

  as always sidi as always three
or four voices hastened to reply nothing
ever takes place here sidi-except a birth
or a death

  a calf was born yesterday o sidi

  it was the cracked voice of the old

rope-maker whose ancient fingers still
twisted at his palmetto leaves his state-
ment was greeted with a roar of laughter
from the other men

  there has been no-no trouble asked
the naib

 no sidi trouble what sort of
trouble

 mustapha shawis wife- it was
the voice of the old rope-maker again-
mustapha shawis wife yesterday beat
him with a stick

  his ancient cackle found no response
mustapha shawi was one of those who stood
about the naib

  let us go the french ministers
voice had lost its diplomatic tone it was
almost a growl i have been-misin-
formed

  so it would seem your excellency
so it would seem

  the naibs voice was gentle inexpressive
he turned his mule slowly and followed
the french minister but after his mount
had taken half a dozen steps he turned and
looked back winking is unknown in
morocco-but they know how to express
the same idea by means of a smile

mntj the french minister was never
ilull fully satisfied concerning this mat-
mlsji ter his agents could never again
find kaid mahalli probably for the very
good reason that what was left of the
worthy kaid was protected from dogs and
jackals by a little cairn of stones among the
anghera hills those who accompanied
the kaid no longer lived in his village
and the village folk said that they had
gone as one man to a very distant set-
tlement in the south that it is true
had been their instructions from mo-
hamed ali

  and finally the french-algerian police
officer with his handful of men were found
wandering among the hills fifty miles away
they wore no clothes when they were
found and as they were fetched to tan-
gier in almost the same condition they
talked very little about their experiences
that little entirely concerned their having
been set upon in the mountains by a great
gang of outlaws who robbed them stripped
them and turned them loose to shift as best
they might they did not even mention
the name of mohamed ali or the village
of el-menar
author of swains burning swains vengeance etc

       own on the strand the mallets
of the shipmen beat a steady
tune and swain olafs son
tarried by the skalli door to
watch the little black dots swarming about
the bare sides of deathbringer and his
brother gunnis dragon seabroth already
the winter sheds had been removed and the
riggers were at work on the tall masts
while other men calked the bottom planks
and spread paint where it was necessary

  to swain watching came his mother
asleif a stately figure such a woman as
must have mothered warriors but in her
eyes the brooding shadow product of
month-long vigils and the bearing of stark
sorrows with dry eyes there was that
in her face this morning too which in
another might have passed for fear-a
dullness of foreboding

  why must you go viking-faring this
year swain she asked we have more
goods and lands than we have use for
in all the orkneys only the jarl is richer
than we

  swain laughed

  ask me why the whaups fly northward
mother the viking-fever kindles in our
blood there is not a man on gairsey
does not hunger for oar rattle and the grip
of a thirsty sword no no the spring
planting is done the fields lie fallow

what should we do if we bided idly at
home

she gave him a curious glance

take a maid to wife perhaps

swain laughed again

a wife what should i do with a wife
women are-ill say no more for you are
woman but saving you i know none
id give bower-room to

nonetheless you should wed swain
persisted his mother here are you and
gunni both growing out of your youth
always wildly aventuring and if harm be-
falls you both our stock is ended

humph grunted swain his eyes on
the shapely longships below the skalli hill
let gunni do it

no returned asleif well you know
gunni will follow your lead and none
other also it is for you the elder to
provide an heir for our lands it is not
fitting that a family such as ours should
end in a single ill-fought struggle

swain shook his head frowning

you forget i still have a vengeance to
achieve he said

say rather i remember that ven-
geance asleif retorted swiftly it is
true that of the slayers of your father and
your brother valthiof you have slain
frakork the witch but frakorks grandson
olvir rosta escaped you and who knows
isi


adventure

but he may surprize you in your sleep or
when you lie in some friendly haven
that is the reason why i want no wife
to hamper my thoughts rejoined swain
when i have found olvir i will talk to
you of this again

  but if olvir finds you first

  he will not swain promised her
grimly

  or gunni

  you are not yourself mother he
answered forget this black thought
that haunts you if frakork lived i
might think she had lain a spell upon you
be at your ease olvir has fled so far
from my wrath that i have not heard trace
of him since he was in iceland that is
why i am off this morning to seek jarl
rognvald and ask him what aid he will
lend me in this cruise

  asleif sighed

  you were never one to take anothers
counsel swain she said but there is
little i have ever asked of you nor have i
hung upon your shield-arm in time of
danger

  swain turned to her with a great light
blazing in his fierce blue eyes tall as she
was he was a head taller and his mighty
shoulders and stalwart limbs had made him
famous for strength through all the coun-
tries of the north so that kings spoke uf
his exploits at the ale-drinking and the
common men called a sudden death a
swains bane

  if i might find a woman like you i
would take her today but well i know your
like is not to be found in any land yet
this i will say for love of you when the
time comes i will wed love or no love so
that your fears may be satisfied

  with this he left her and went down to
the shore and boarded a small sailing-boat
in which he crossed the narrow waters of
the efjasund to the mainland of hrossey
hrossey he crossed by way of rennadale
and steinsness to jarl rognvalds steading
at orphir he walked into the skalli at
candle-lighting and the jarl hailed him
from the high table in the hall jarl
rognvald had much love for swain al-
though in times past he had felt the weight
of his wrath

  you are come in a good hour swain
he greeted him with twinkling eyes i
have been expecting you ever since the
southland traders began to sail in it is in

my mind that you are late astir this year

  i never sail seaward in any year lord
jarl until the spring planting is done re-
turned swain viking plunder is not food

  therein you show good sense ap-
proved the jarl i wish that you were
as well-advised in other ways

  for what do you find fault with me
lord jarl inquired swain

  for your failure to take account of the
future

  you are past your green youth yet you
have never gotten sons to protect your
lands after you are gone that is foolish
swain you are the richest man without
title in the north but if you and your
brother gunni die your property wili be
divided among the most powerful bidders
for it

  i have no traffic with women an-
swered swain sourly

  they have their uses observed the
jarl

  women growled swain are like
oar-foam they are a spatter of words in
your face

  jarl rognvald laughed hugely

  the truth of that i will not deny he
admitted yet they appear to be neces-
sary in this world however it is for you
to order your own life what can i do
for you

  as you have guessed without diffi-
culty lord jarl answered swain i am
ready to go viking-faring are you of a
mind to lend me your aid in this cruise as
of yore

  before the jarl could reply his young
cousin jarl harald who shared his rule
with him burst into the hall dragging a
man after him

  ho swain so you are here cried
harald that is well for here is one who
has come far to seek you and he brings
great news

 this jarl harald was a youth in the
beginning of manhood dark and of middle
height he had a considerable admira-
tion for swain to whom indeed he owed
his estate in the islands for swain had
brought him to orphir as a child and se-
cured for him from jarl rognvald a half
of the jarldom because as swain said
one jarl rules with might two jarls rule
with justice

  the man with jarl harald was a bandy-
legged fellow very swarthy in the face
swains sons



and he had a cast in one eye but his cloth-
ing and armor proclaimed him a chief
he bowed low to jarl rognvald and ad-
dressed himself to swain although it was
difficult always to be sure which way he
was looking on account of his cast eye

  i see that my luck has changed he
said for i have found swain olafs son
easier than i expected to

  all men do not count themselves
lucky to meet swain olafs son returned
swain frowning who are you

  and the stranger answered freely
enough-

  my name is holdbodi and i hold lands
in liodhus from the king of the su-
dreyar

   swains face cleared

  that is better i have heard men
speak of you holdbodi what is it you
wish of me

  men have said that you were concerned
with one olvir rosta grandson of frakork
the witch replied holdbodi

  i am i am concerned to hew his head
from his neck

  then it may be i can be of some as-
sistance to you

  swain leaped up from the high table and
brought the full scowling menace of his
bearded face to bear upon the oblique
eyes of the sudreyarman

  you waste time chattering he rasped
say your say and have done

  holdbodi nodded and a close watcher
might have fancied there was a crafty
light in his slewed right eye

  i will i will he promised there are
always formalities to be observed in ap-
proaching famous men the plain truth of
the matter is that olvir rosta has burned

my steading-

  is olvir in these parts shouted swain

  why i have just said-

  you have said too much-or not
enough

  swain vaulted the table-top and landed
catlike beside the stranger

  speak quickly or-

  he was in liodhus protested hold-
bodi where he is now i cannot say ex-
cept that his galleys pointed south

  give the stranger an opportunity to
find his words swain advised jarl
rognvald let him tell his tale in his
own fashion

    lewis  hebrides

  i thank you lord jarl remarked the
sudreyarman all men say you are

fair-spoken-

  so am not i interrupted swain sourly
your tongue runs all around the skalli
if you would share my friendship you will
speak with judgment

  holdbodi bowed to him even lower than
he had to the jarl

  indeed if you will not assist me swain
i am in despair of securing my just ven-
geance-

  again swains face cleared

  so you seek vengeance upon olvir
holdbodi that is well but be sure to
remember that no hand but mine is to give
him his death-blow

  i have no desire to match blades per-
sonally with olvir observed holdbodi
drily

  then we shall agree excellently said
swain tell us your story i am sur-
prized by what you say for i hunted all
the northern seas last autumn for a trace
of olvir without uncovering a single
clue

  that is not strange answered the
sudreyarman from what his men let
drop in liodhus he has spent recent years
in iceland and greenland acquiring wealth
with which to outfit two longships and se-
cure crews for them he sailed south
from iceland with the clearing of the floes
and liodhus was the first land he struck
i escaped from him with difficulty bor-
rowed a longship from my brother and
came east to ask your assistance for i
am not strong enough alone to go against
him that is my story swain

  youll take me swain struck in young
jarl harald you have promised me
these past two winters you must take
me swain where should i find a better
opportunity to become a warrior than upon
such an expedition

  it is an unusually good opportunity to
lose your head responded swain olvir
is a skilled warrior and- you say he has
two longships with him holdbodi

  he had when he came to liodhus
answered the sudreyarman but men said
he was for heading southward to man and
the west coast of bretland and there
is not knowing how many masterless
men and rovers he may win there to his
standard

adventure

  holdbodi says truly counseled jarl
rognvald depend upon it swain olvir
will wax strong this spring let others
take toll of him first then do you come
at him after his strength begins to wane
swain glowered

  i was never a man to ask shame for my
portion he growled let olvir have a
chance to say that he was in these waters
and i did not give him battle rather
would i be impaled alive upon the point
of his spear i sail so soon as my ships
are boun

  and i go with you swain clamored
young jarl harald you will not be
sorry for it i can strike as rare a blow as
old gutorm who captains rognvalds
housecarls

  there was a general burst of laughter
it is for you to ask jarl rognvald
harald swain pointed out

  no no answered rognvald i will
not have the responsibility cast upon me
swain if the boy was killed my enemies-
and every man has enemies as you know-
would say that i had sent him off to be rid
of him

  that is true admitted swain and
i will take it upon myself lord jarl to
advise you to permit young jarl harald to
sail with me in order that he may become
a warrior the orkneyfolk will be proud of
in that case he shall go replied jarl
rognvald and as it is my desire that you
shall be able to make a proud showing and
overcome olvir even though he gains
allies i will lend youtwo longships with
full crews on the usual understanding that
a fair proportion of your booty is to be
awarded to me and to my men

  swain hammered his fist upon the table
  ho lord jarl that is generous

  and he swung around upon holdbodi
there is a jarl for you he continued
if there were many such fellows like
olvir would soon be ravens food

  jarl rognvald clapped his hands for the
servingmen

  it is a pleasure to assist you swain
he said and now we will eat and drink ale
together

  no returned swain hastily let
holdbodi stay if he chooses but i must be
off to gairsey to hasten my ship-men in
bouning our dragons we shall be at
orphir three days hence lord jarl and

    equipped ready loaded

with your permission will sail the day
following

  jarl rognvald smiled at holdbodi

  there was never a man for hurrying
like swain he observed when he has
a notion in his head there is no room for
anything else well well we will get along
without him as well as we can

  and i will give orders to have the sheds
removed from your longships rognvald
offered young jarl harald we must not
be behind swain here at orphir

  whereat they all laughed anew and
swain and harald strode out of the skalli
into the darkness of the early night there
was a raw wind blowing out of the north
and young harald shuddered

  that is a cold wind he muttered

  it is an ill wind answered swain i
smell death in it

h

hthe wind out of the north was
snrnf stiu tearing the wave-crests of the
pentland firth when swains fleet
sailed from orphir he had five longships
and all of four hundred men his own great
dragon deathbringer pulling thirty oars a
side gunnis dragon seabroth of twenty
oars jarl rognvalds two longships each
of twenty oars and holdbodis dingy craft
which pulled eighteen oars and carried a
crew of sixty or seventy hairy skin-clad
flat-faced sudreyarmen who talked with
a whistling intonation in high excited
voices and were better stone-slingers and
knife-fighters than swordsmen chancey
folk they were called in the north jarl
rognvald drew swain aside upon orphir
strand the while bishop william was
blessing the longships and the crews were
embarking

  i say nothing against this holdbodi
swain remarked the jarl he seems a
fair cup-fellow and friendly in his views
but all folk are agreed that the sudreyar-
men are treacherous be on your guard
swain laughed in his golden-red beard
what harm could he wreak if he sought
to he demanded no lord jarl the
man who is outnumbered five to one is he
you may rely upon to the death-because
he dies if he seeks to betray

  that is all very well returned the
jarl take my counsel or leave it but
sooner or later you will find it worth while
swains sons



  so they sailed in the teeth of the gale
with the foam spurting through the oar-
holes and the waves breaking over the
laboring dragons heads but after they had
rounded the point of scotland at hvart
they entered the waters of scotlands
firth with the wind behind them and

the seas moderated somewhat they came
to liodhus with fair weather and bespoke
the islands there for news of olvir people
answered them with grief-stricken faces

  it is little trouble you will be having in
following him they said his path is
ruddy with blood and soiled by fire wherever
he has been

  swain held on to the south touching at
nord ivist for further news from here the
trail of olvirs slayings and burnings led
them east across the firth to skidh and
then southward again to tyrvist and ii
but however hard the crews rowed how-
ever steadily the wind blew they could not
catch up with olvir

   cape wrath  north minch northuist  sky

 tyree  islay  ulster

  from ii he had crossed the tossing waters
of the open ocean to uladstir where
swains company found a charred village on
the shores of ulfresksfiord and all the
way south on the irish coast villages were
smoking ruins but not until they had
penetrated the waters of irlands haf
did they come close enough to olvir to
feel that they were at last a menace
to him

  this was on the day they sighted the
cliffs of man a small sailboat danced out
to meet them and from it a single bluff
leather-faced man in rusty mail climbed to
deathbringers deck

  i am called erik skallagrims son he
announced shortly unawed by the armed
men around him by any chance is
swain olafs son among you

  swain bent a scowling glance upon him
i am swain what is that to you
much rejoined the other laconically
i am come on behalf of the lady ingrid
who is queen in man since her husbands
death olvir rosta slew him in battle
two weeks since and fled to bretland with
his following after word reached him that
you had been seen in ulfresksfiord and were
sailing south

  where is olvir gone demanded swain
  to bretland i said swain

 yes but-

  now be reasonable pleaded the leath-
er-faced little man it is a great country
bretland but if you will beach your
longships and lodge with us a while at
stikleborg the lady ingrid will send out
scouts to endeavor to learn where olvir
has gone he will not go far because he
has joined forces with hrodbjart who
is a bretlander who lives outside the law
on his own account and they plan to ravage
all this part of the world between them and
bring it under their sway

  humph said swain what sort of
woman is this lady ingrid has she
means

  she has man which is a very rich
island answered erik

  is she old

  erik grinned

  she is commonly said to be beautiful
but since all men do not agree as to beauty
i prefer to leave you to judge for yourself
swain spat overside

  bah i detest all women but most cf

   	irish sea  robert
adventure

all these soft-handed long-haired crooning
creatures

  she is no fresh bower-maiden rejoined
erik slyly amused come and see her
she bids you ashore by me and wishes
to have you and your people for her guests
so long as you will tarry

  we will tarry as long as suits us
rasped swain but not to see her i came
here to find olvir rosta when i get
news of whither he is gone i shall be off
after him

  no one will seek to stop you said
erik let viking hew viking the man-
folk say

  why should you speak for them

  i am ingrids steward

  can you fight as well as wag your
tongue erik

  i was iceland born

  swain smiled at the little man taken de-
spite himself by eriks bantering swagger

  we will make trial of you he said
you shall be in the front of the raven-
feeders when our bows crash through
olvirs oar-banks meantime my people
are bench-weary and we will go ashore
and bid this lady ingrid show what she
will do to aid us in slaying her husbands
slayer

  she wifi marry you said erik assuredly
  swain stared at him

  marry me who do you think you are
talking to manling marry me i am
swain olafs son the woman- you are
bewitched as for her-let her cast but a
glance and ill flog her from her own hall
with my sword blade

  swains housecarls roared with approv-
ing laughter
the little icelander pursed his lips

  if it isnt you it will be somebody else
he said she has rich lands

  he fingered on the last words but swain
did not hear him having turned impatiently
to shout his orders to the longship next
astern

ill

there was a sheltered cove on
the shore under stikleborg and
swain ordered his captains to let
the longships ride here the while they went
up to the skalli of the lady of the islands-
who after the manner in those parts was
queen in man-and made trial of her
hospitality but because he was cautious

and trusted no strangers he left one-half
the ships companies on board

  it is true we have this icelander erik
for hostage he growled as he stood in
the midst of his vikings on the wet beach
and if we come near ingrid we can hold
her too but i am of no mind to present
the manfolk with a viking fleet for the
taking

  you are a forehanded man commented
erik who was standing by in his dry
way but you concern yourself to no
purpose

  touching this lady ingrid spoke up
holdbodi moistening his bps with a large
tongue if she be in the mood for marriage
it might be wise for us to humor her
here are broad lands to be warded and
much wealth to be secured

  we are not a bridal party reproved
swain harshly we are the executors of
vengeance

  oh yes vengeance comes first hold-
bodi agreed nevertheless if a marriage

was to aid the vengeance-

  we will take what we need swain
cut him short

so will we gunni affirmed after him
yes yes muttered the other chiefs
enough of talking said swain loose
your swords and we will climb to the skalli
erik you guide us and my spear splits
your neck if there is sign of treachery

  it is you who waste words snapped
erik do i look like one who would
invite a spear in my back

  so they climbed the foreshore to the
upland and came to stikleborg which had
been the strong place of ingrids husband
and in which she now dwelt it was a
steading richer even than jarl rognvalds
at orphir farms and dairies surrounded
the borg itself which was a palisaded wall
atop of a bank of earth with a wide dry
ditch and inside this protection the skalli
and its necessary outbuildings many of
the manfolk lined the way and watched
with awed faces the two hundred strapping
fellows who followed swain in their mail
the darkness had settled as they reached
the borg entrance and torchbearers came
out to njeet them the flames flickering
on steer caps and big raven-shields and
long yellow mustaches

  swain strode along with his chin in air
his fierce eyes boring at the half-seen
figures in his path in front of him
swains sons



walked erik at his back walked gunni
holdbodi and young jarl harald quivering
with interest in his first venture and thorar
asgrims son and leif anakols son the
captains of jarl rognvalds two longships

  they tramped over a bridge of planks
across the ditch and passed the earthen
walls into a wide open space aglow with
fires where oxen were roasting slowly and
huge kegs of ale stood open for the horn
directly in their path stood a single figure
a woman at sight of whom swains lips
curled and his clutch tightened upon the
haft of the spear that was close to eriks
back she took a single step forward as
the column approached a step sufficient
to bring her into the full glare of one of the
fires and swain owned against his will
that she was handsome

  a tallstrapping wench irish by her
gray eyes and the long black hair that had
a glint of blue in it in the uncertain light
her features were marred by a kind of wil-
ful arrogance her full lips parted in a con-
stant pout around her she had wrapped
a long black cloak which she held fast
over her breast

  are these the brave strangers who will
avenge my murdered husband erik she
demanded in resonant tones

  this is swain olafs son of whom you
have heard lady replied erik

  the woman advanced another step and
flung out both her arms in a theatrical
gesture of appeal

  i am a widow-alone and wronged
swain she cried will you help me
whatever payment you ask shall be yours

   swain came to a halt and glowered at her

  why should i help you he countered

  i am rich i can pay you

  if i want your property i can take it
returned swain

  she looked somewhat puzzled this was
not the answer which evidently she had
expected erik seemed suddenly to be con-
cerned with the straps of his harness

  it would ill become a noble chief like
you to take advantage of my friendship
she replied at last

  swain snapped his thumb and finger

  that for your friendship you want
something of me

   only what you ought to be glad to offer
she flashed white teeth gleaming for an
instant between pouting red lips

   i am not one to fight other peoples bat-

tles rejoined swain if your interest
matches my interest i may talk to you
otherwise we have no meeting-place
holdbodi behind him thrust mouth to
his ear

  hold in swain he whispered here
are rich pickings dont lose them for us
swain growled deep in his throat in a
way he had-and holdbodi quickly melted
back into the group of chiefs but ingrid
in the firelight had observed his move and
she tried again

  it pleases you to be rough in your
answer to me swain she said holding
herself proudly erect perhaps you do
not know that a week ago i caused it to
be proclaimed that whoever brought me
the head of olvir rosta who slew my
husband and lord andrew morkars son
him i would wed be he chief or common
man irlander bretlander scotsman or of
the folk of the sudreyar or the hebrides
i did not know it admitted swain
but it does not interest me

  ah then you are not concerned to slay

olvir rosta who men say-

  no i am not concerned with you lady
unless you can aid me with men and ships
to go after olvir

  i can do much she cried

  do you prove it to us then for my-
self i will give the man who slays olvir
lands and gear to make him rich for life-
but it is easy for me to promise that be-
cause it will be i who slay olvir

  she came still closer to him an artificial
grimace of rage masking her lovely face

  i will prove my words she hissed
whatever you choose-take it take
all my men my gear my ships take
me-use me for oar-grease do with me
what you will only promise to slay me

that foul-

  swain pushed her roughly aside

  this is no place for womans chatter
he rasped we are warriors hungry from
the sea be off and see to the servingmen
that they do not try our patience be off
i say

  erik granted him a reluctant glance of
admiration as she scuttled away into the
shadows

  ho you are no boaster swain but
mark me marriage she will have so you
may as well single out him of your company
you like least or best eh

  a man might do worse than wed with


adventure

such a fair woman pressed holdbodi

here are broad lands and-

  you have said that before snarled
swain i will not have it do you see
i will not have it tomorrow we sail
hence after olvir then battle after bat-
tle- let the ravens croak their answer
the ravens will answer agreed gunni
women remarked young jarl harald
have no place in mens thoughts on the
eve of battle

  there was a gruff bellow of laughter
even swain joined

  a stout borg this he remarked criti-
cally casting his eye around the circuit
of the enclosure with this to fall back
upon it will be strange if we do not come
to an accounting with olvir

on the next day ingrid would
have had swain and the other

       chiefs to talk with her in the skalli
but when she appeared in the steading
swain sent her word by erik that there
was mans work to be done and that she
could best aid them by keeping out of the
way she flung back to her bower in
a black storm-cloud of anger biting her
lips until the blood ran yet it was not
long before swain came to her he
strode in unannounced and stared at her
with hard dislike where she huddled sullenly
on a furstrewn couch

 any vengeance you secure you will pay
for he announced

 i she peered at him almost hopefully

 i said i would pay she began

 why could you not do

 do i am only a woman swain

what-

 you are also a queen could you not
 have mustered and armed your people
 could you not have provided fresh arrows
 could you not have had the old mail
 mended could you not have swords for
 your housecarls with an edge to cut cheese

 loaves could you-

 i need a man to do that for me she
 interrupted with what she meant for an
 alluring look

 swain simply glowered

 you wont get one from me he
 barked this island was ripe for the
 first comer to pluck if i had not hap-
 pened along olvir would have gathered
 it in-and you with it yes you would
 have lost your widowhood by now

  i am not fond of it she said desper-
ately frank andrew was old and-

  i am not interested in you said swain
brutally what concerns me is that i
getjaway from here as swiftly as possible
and i find that your people are untrained
to war that your arms-chests are empty
and your longships are broken or decayed
well i shall take what i can use after-
ward i shall return and collect payment
from you for the trouble you have put me
to be sure to have a payment ready for
me to select from or i will take twice what
otherwise would satisfy me

  and he turned upon his heel

  but are you going away now she
cried

  he did not answer her but from the
walls of the borg she saw the fleet stand
to the southeast an hour later swains
five longships supplemented by two others
which erik had produced and which con-
siderable effort had made water-tight
the sun was already far down in the west-
ward sky and the massing shadows in
the east soon blotted out the lean hulls
of the longships with their huge square
bellying sails and myriad crawling oars

  toward morning they came to a head-
land of the bretland coast called jarlsness
and waited in the purple dusk bows drawn
close together in a star-shaped formation
so that the ship-captains could exchange
counsel and presently there winged out to
them a small sailing vessel one of several
which erik had dispatched in advance of
their coming to scout the neighborhood
erik himself was on this boat and he
scrambled aboard deathbringer to give
swain his report

  they are here swain he said curtly
as i thought they would be there was
a wealthy abbey up the river a ways be-
sides a town and a dozen villages and two
small lords castles and all these olvir has
plundered we had the word from cer-
tain poor folk we found on the beaches
his men are glutted with slaying and
plunder

  what is here demanded swain
where do they he

  beyond that headland-a score of
them

  a score

  big craft and little dragons and ten-
oared barges and a few fishing-boats
how many dragons has he
swains sons



  two of his own and hrodbjarts two
but he has twice the men you have

  mongrels answered swain what
have we to fear from such as they we
will run them down at their rowing-
benches

  he considered

  how long shall we take to round the
headland

  with this wind an hour perhaps
more

  swain raised his great voice in a hail
that carried through the fleet

  olvir rosta is close by we go to him
dealhbringer leads the way ravens throng
the sky

  a shout rose from the crowded longships
the deep booming voices of the orkneymen
mingling with the shriller tones of hold-
bodis people and the manfolk

  lead on swainl we follow

  but will olvir stand to it clamored
young jarl harald excitedly will he
stand to it when he sees us swain

  swain laughed shortly

  he will stand to it for we will carry
it to him wherever he stands erik get
you aboard one of your dragons i look
to you to keep the manfolk in line every
sword counts

  if all slay as many as i none will escape
us returned the icelander coolly but
by your leave swain i use the ax it has
advantages for one of my stature

  slay all you can said swain but
on your head spare olvir rosta for me
oh ill pass him by said erik he
is one i will gladly pass by i saw him
slice andrews head off as though it-yes
yes swain i am going

  and the little man scrambled over the
bulwarks of deathbringer leaping from
ship to ship until he gained his own vessels
decks then they hoisted the sails and
the seven longships straightened out in one
anothers wakes churning the foam as they
advanced

  all went well until the dawn broke
when the wind freshened and shifted blow-
ing head on against them with the result
that they were compelled to lower their
sails and continue by rowing alone a hard
and toilsome undertaking under such con-
ditions swain by the steersmen of death-
bringer watched their slow progress with
mounting fury it meant that instead
of coming upon olvir on the heels of the

twilight while his men were heavy-headed
and unready they would round the head-
land in the middle of the morning to find
the hostile vessels awake and in shape to
prepare to meet them half of their ad-
vantage was gone but swain never thought
of abandoning the attempt he intended
to come to hand-grips with olvir if they
must row all through that day and into the
next night and as a matter of fact the sun
was almost overhead when they finally
rounded jarlsness and in the bight formed
by the estuary of a considerable river
glimpsed the riding hulls of their enemies

  the hooked end of the promontory moder-
ated the winds force upon this side of it
and it was possible for the seven longships
to straggle into line abreast in response
to swains orders shouted through a ludr-
horn he placed deathbringer at the right
end of the line the outer flank because he
looked for the enemy to attempt to break
free in that direction next him were
jarl rognvalds dragons then erik and
the two man ships then holdbodi and the
sudreyarfolk and lastly on the far left
gunni in seabroth they all drew in
their oars so that the rowers might rest
their tired arms and shoulders for the fray
and with the wind squarely over their
sterns slanted down upon olvirs fleet
which was bustling with sudden activity

  swain stood on the poop of deathbringer
with young jarl harald beside him and
a half-score of giant housecarls the
waist was crammed with the idle oarsmen
who had donned mail shirts and caps
the forecastle was dense with spearmen
and archers overhead the sun shone
brightly and the wind thrummed like a
skald picking at harpstrings in the cordage
and the huge straining hollow of the sail

  gradually as they drew nearer olvirs
fleet formed into a sort of hasty order
the four dragons two of twenty-four and
two of twenty oars became its nucleus
on either side of them clustered a pack of
barges and fishing-boats small in size
but overflowing with men and they surged
forward using their oars perforce as the
wind was against them the dragons
forged rapidly to the front propelled by
their scores of oars and tiie small craft
tailed out behind in a kind of wedge with
its point-the four dragons-aimed at the
center of swains line

  swain perceived this at once and he
io

adventure

endeavored as well as he could to constrict
his front so as to reduce the intervals be-
tween his ships but in that wind and on a
rocky coast the agile longships required an
unusual amount of handling-room and
he dared not tighten the line as he would
otherwise have done

  they will strike erik or thorar
exclaimed jarl harald

   then erik or thorar will die grunted
swain but in the turmoil we shall ring
them and those who do not swim ashore
to be slain by the folk they have despoiled
will die upon our blades

   which is olvirs ship

  how should i know boy i have
never seen it before

   shall i try an arrow upon their leader
it is down wind

  no no hold your arrows until you
can see the face of him you shoot at
steady helmsman what are they doing
without warning the opposing fleet
had shifted direction and were striking
obliquely across the front of swains line
aiming at gunnis flank

  they can never pass between gunni
and the rocks cried jarl harald there

is not-

  swain interrupted with a bull roar of
rage

  larboard helmsmen larboard all
and running to the rail he shouted to
leif his next in line to larboard

   pass the word to bear off to larboard
they will crush gunni and holdbodi

   leif shouted the order to thorar and so
it traversed the line of seven ships but
the shift came too late to avert olvirs
stroke wind and oars on either side
combined to bring on the impact between
the left flank of swains formation and the
spearhead of olvirs attack before swains
center and right could come into action

  olvirs four dragons charged bluntly
into holdbodis and gunnis and their
tail of small fry overwhelmed momentarily
eriks two ships there was a grinding of
planking the shrieking of boarders caught
and pinched between lurching hulls the
snap of masts as rigging was cut asunder
the thrashing of falling sails

   holdbodi saw the menace of his position
and backed away dropping his sail and
turning his attention to the small craft
t that had attacked eriks ships but gunni
imet the odds of four to one without yielding

a foot of sea-room it was his mast that
fell as the boarders slashed the over-
burdened rigging it was his crew who
leaped on the rowing-benches and met the
assaults that poured over both quarters and
one bow it was he who lifted an im-
mense ballast stone from beneath the
gangway planking poised it an instant
upon his shoulder and then flung it over-
side to smash through the bottom of hrod-
bjarts dragon and send the bretlander
careering to the bottom

  but gunni alone might not stay that
wolf-rush of numbers four times his own
hrodbjarts men those who could scram-
bled from their sinking vessel reckless of
what fate they met so long as it was not
drowning and bravely faced the spears
and swords of gunnis waist-men on his
starboard side olvir boarded hewing a
passage through the ranks of the orkney
oarsmen olvirs other dragon launched
a flood of icelanders led by raging ber-
serks fey men who had no fear of dying if
they might die slaying others who swarmed
over gunnis forecastle in five minutes
of close fighting these three streams of
invaders penned gunni and a surviving
handful of men into the constricted space
of the poop

  swain raging with helpless anger saw
his brothers end as he rounded against
the wind furled his sail and with out-
thrust oars led rognvalds two longships
into the heart of the fight that centered
about holdbodi and the two man long-
ships two barges he crushed under his
dragon-bow and his archers took fearful
toll of the crowded open decks of every
small vessel they passed but despite his
urging his men could not reach seabroth
in time to save gunni the second of
hrodbjarts dragons was in his path and
while he refused to stop and take it bellow-
ing an order to leif behind him to lay it
aboard he was obliged to shove it out of his
way and exchange spears and arrows with
its crew as he drove by

  in that very moment heedless of the
hostile arrows that clinked on shield and
mail he saw his brother alone upon sea-
broths poop reeling from a dozen bleeding
wounds he saw too the squat powerful
black-bearded figure that crouched toward
gunni with lifted spear he saw gunnis
feeble effort to lift a riven shield to raise
the heavy sword then the spear flashed
swains sons



gunni fell a hoarse shout of satisfaction
rang down the wind olvir sprang away
his men pelting after him along the stream-
ing decks of seabroth they regained their
own dragons and cast off oars darted
through the oar-holes foam spurted under
the drive of shoulders still hampered with
mail and open water showed between them
and their victim an empty lifeless man-
gutted hulk that tossed upon the waves

  swain leaped into the waist of death-
bringer and strode up the gangway such
a look on his face that no man could
meet it

  row he bellowed row as you
have never rowed before the man who
hesitates i will impale alive put your
backs into it do you call this effort
row i say shall i beat you with my
sword row

  they were all freeborn men but none
answered nor did a single oar slip in its
work but try as they might they could not
gain upon olvirs lighter dragons which in
such a sea were easier to drive then
as they came to the end of the headland
the wind veered again and blew from the
northeast and olvirs sails were raised
to catch it

  up sail growled swain if they
can outgrow us perhaps we can outsail
them

  it was not to be hard-driven one of
olvirs ships tore its over-strained sail
to shreds and fell off into the trough of
the waves its men exhausted by their
toils dipping feebly with their oars swain
contented himself with pouring arrows into
it at short range and steered on as soon as
he was sure that olvir was not on board
confident that thorar and leif who fol-
lowed him would take care of the enemy
without difficulty

  all that day he pursued olvir southwest-
erly across irlands haf when the irland
coast towered green ahead the outlaw
bore to the south and held the course
until darkness obscured the sea swain
set double watches on the forecastle and
himself climbed to the masthead where he
might gain the widest sweep of the night
and scarce a man of the crew slept until
morning dawned and they found them-
selves beyond sight of land-alone sea-
gulls swooped and dived but not another
sign of life was within view olvir had
vanished

   

   but swain refused to be discouraged he
steered northwest and poked into several
harbors of the southern coast of irland
where olvir might have sought shelter
but the irish all denied having had sight
of the raider although many knew his
name from his exploits of old baffled
but still undismayed swain turned to the
open sea gain and sailed to syllingar
where he sought speech with the monks
who dwelt in this bare wind-swept place
all they could tell was that some days
since about the time he had first lost
trace of his prey they had sighted a single
longship with tattered sail and salt-
crusted bulwarks which had beat past the
islands headed toward the south

   yes that would be he he said bitterly
who my son asked the gray prior
one who shall yet feel the bite of my
sword rumbled swain

the prior raised a crucifix in protestation
no no my son man of blood that
you are accept the unfortunates escape
as a divine intervention to save you from
taking his life

   swain reached for his sword

  if i thought that- but no matter
my time will come

   and he stalked back to his vessel heaving
below the monastery landing his men
heard the tidings in silence except young

	jarl harald

  then we continue our voyage re-
marked the boy in matter-of-fact tones
if olvir went south he can go only as far
as the edge of the world sooner or later
we must come up to him

   a growl of laughter came from swains
bearded lips

  you are a mastiff he said that
was well-spoken but if you were older
you would know that it is a long way to the
worlds edge with many ways to turn and
twist and double before the edge is reached
no harald olvir has escaped us this ven-
ture and our course is to go back and bide
until he comes again

   but will he come again asked harald
doubtfully

   he will because his evil spirit drives
him also i shall have something which
he desires

  what

   that is to be seen in the meantime
we will return and discover what our

     the scyllies


adventure

friends have achieved in our absence out
oars

  and as the dragon bucked under the
pull of the stout ash-sweeps he muttered
so low that none might hear him

  and there are words i must have with
holdbodi the swine yes jarl rogn-
vald was right beware of the sudrey-
armen if they are not treacherous they
think only of themselves

v

h swain was met on the beach at
stikleborg by thorar and leif
erik was with them and all the
surviving orkneymen a considerable
number

  it is to be seen that you had ill luck
swain said erik

  i have been out of favor with the gods
in recent days returned swain but
ill luck some day must become good luck

thorar cleared his throat uncomfortably

 you know gunni-

  i saw what happened swain cut him
short

  we gave him haugh burial on the point
of jarlsness said leif there are four
hundred to keep him company and the
mound is to be seen from afar

  i would not have had it otherwise
said swain

  then there was a pause which lasted
as long as it takes a man to tighten his
helm-strap

touching olvir rosta hinted erik

he escaped me answered swain short-
ly he is gone south of the syllingar

  ah said erik but what was in my
mind is that i am tired of serving the lady
here and the new lord she picked-or who
has picked her i know not which it is and
i have taken thought that i would throw
in my fortunes with you swain if you
cared for a man who was willing to accept
luck as it comes and could persuade a few
others to follow him

  he grinned

  you were not close by in the fight off
jarlsness but perhaps others will tell you
that i was not the one to give ground to
olvir

  swains blue eyes steel-cold with a bright
piercing light peered down into the little
bandy-legged icelanders

i will take you for my man erik

he answered but my service is not so easy
as ingrids

  or holdbodis perhaps answered erik
with his quirky grin

  swain frowned

  i have somewhat to say to holdbodi
he observed if he had held his place in

the line at jarlsness-

  he would not sit in ingrids bower now
finished erik

  thorar and leif big slow of speech
exchanged looks of misgiving which swain
did not miss

  what is this veiled talk he demanded
thorar and leif cleared their throats
gulped shifted their feet it was erik
who answered

  why you and holdbodi are not agreed
concerning the merits of his deeds off
jarlsness he talks largely of having
stayed the rush of olvirs people and is
taking the lady ingrid for his share in the
spoil

  swain frowned

  have you permitted this he asked
thorar and leif i was not here but

surely you two-

  they found their tongues

  he said that you had no use for her
protested thorar

  and we were loath to pick a quarrel
with him said leif

  it was my advice to abide your return
added erik no harm has been done yet
and the issue lies in your hands swain
he can have her and welcome said
swain but her lands are a different
matter

  and then he remembered his brother
gunni dead he remembered the smoking
skalli which had been the pyre of his father
and his elder brother valthiof he re-
membered his mothers words at gairsey
and the half-bantering advice of jarl
rognvald a sudden resolution formed in
his mind

  lands and woman go together he
went on no he can not have her either
erik darted a quick glance at him and
chuckled

  ho swain did i not say-

  you have said much swain rebuked
him i like you little man but curb your
tongue what i propose to do i do for
reasons which suit my own ends come
we will go up to the borg

  they followed him and eriks face was
swains sons

now as puzzled as thorars and leifs
after them tramped the orkneymen shields
clinking on the backs of their mail-shirts
the manfolk along the road watched them
pass with anxious looks

  in the gateway of the borg beyond the
plank bridge stood a knot of sudreyarmen
perhaps a score or more their ranks
knit closer as the boards creaked under the
feet of swains following

  do you come in peace hailed one of
them

  swain answered not a word until he was
within arms reach of the fellow then
he caught him by the arm and tossed him
four spears lengths away

  out of my path he growled put
up those knives-or orkney swords will
drink your blood

  they melted before him and several
started to run toward the skalli but swain
heaved back a spear as if to cast it after
them and one who marked his gesture
called to the others and they skulked aside

  thorar rasped swain take fifty
men and keep the gate

and what of holdbodis people swain
send them forth peaceably or by force
leif do you take a hundred men and scour
the borg no fighting if they do not ask
for it remember

  a second knot of holdbodis people
hovered by the skalli door but they had
observed the incident at the gate and they
offered swain no active opposition he
brushed past them carelessly erik and
fifty of his own men behind him and en-
tered the great hall where ingrid and
holdbodi sat side by side at the high table
servants cowered behind the arras on the
walls or darted into half-concealed door-
ways fearful of the aburpt invasion of
armed men holdbodi too looked un-
comfortable he had half-risen in his
place and his hand was on his sword-hilt
ingrid next to him stared at swain with
a kind of preening triumph it was as if
she regarded this episode as a tribute to her
an indication of her importance in the
affairs of these men she spoke first

so you are back swain that is well
you are in time to give my lord his due for
the triumph his valor won upon our behalf
swains laughter rumbled to the roof-
rafters

  we shall have discussion of that valor
he answered what say you holdbodi

  i say that your jest is not becoming
to a friend and loyal ally blustered the
sudreyarman why do you bring in
this rabble to the hall it has an ill

look 

  it has agreed swain and so had
the borg when i entered it a moment since
there was a stink of uncured sudreyar
fur but we have mended that

  holdbodi sank into his chair and ner-
vously twitched at his beard

  you speak as though i was your enemy
swain he remonstrated what harm
have i done to you

  none returned swain promptly un-
less it was by playing the cowards part
to leave my brother to die under the teeth
of a wolf-pack

  holdbodi started up

  this passes jest he shouted ten
of my men died in that fight and my ship
was covered with blood and you accuse
me of being a coward if our forces were

even-

  oh that need not concern you said
swain i will send all forth from the
hall if it pleases you

  ingrid was crouched over the table
throughout their talk a fever-flush of in-
terest staining her cheeks her eyes alight
with the hunger for mens attention which
was the keystone to her character

  yes send them forth she begged
eagerly it is not fitting for two chiefs
to quarrel before the common men send
them forth swain and i will be judge
between you

  before swains look she huddled down
in her seat

be still he said there is one chief
here one chief in man and i am judge
you may be chief of our expedition
swain fumed holdbodi but you have
no right to order me as if i was your man

and as for calling me coward-

  you are no coward when it is to your
advantage to fight said swain but you
were not man enough to hold your place
in line and aid gunni to meet olvirs
rush if you had perhaps you would
have died but olvir would not have
escaped

  i could not do everything muttered
holdbodi sulkily my one ship held
back all olvirs tail a hundred of his men
met their death at the hands of my
people


adventure

  you did not play a mans part an-
swered swain and so i tell you plainly
also i take it in bad part that while i was
away in pursuit of olvir you should seek
to seize the wealth of the island for
yourself

  it is true that the lady has promised
to marry me admitted holdbodi a
thought shame-facedly but i had no in-
tent to secure an unfair division of what
booty there is

  were you planning to carry her back
to liodhus asked swain sarcastically

 no for-

  for her lands are here

  why not returned holdbodi some-
body must hold them for her

  but that need not be you it will not
be you

  this time holdbodi jumped up crimson
with wrath

  you shall not give her to one of your

men she has promised-

  she will promise anything but she
will marry me

  the sudreyarmans cast eye rolled wildly
ingrid herself emitted a little screech
part surprize part pleasure and forgot
swains recent snub erik grinned quietly
to himself and swains orkneymen rattled
spear-shafts and sword-hilts upon their
shields in applause

 but you would not have anything
to-

  forget what is past holdbodi i say
now that i shall marry her

  she is promised to me wailed hold-
bodi

  swain smiled grimly his tight-lipped
savage grimace which never inspired a taste
for mirth in an opponent

  that is easily mended if she bleats-
as i do not think she will-well drown her
cries with the shield-rattling but married
she shall be before the sun sets tonight
ingrid leaped lithely from her seat and
stretched out her arms toward swain

  this is the mating a woman craves
swain she cried to be seized by a
strong man whether she wills it or not
to be torn from one man by a stronger
ah my viking ingrid of man will be
worthy of you

  swain did not speak a single word to her
but the blue flame of his eyes from under
leveled bushy brows drove her cowering
behind the untidy furniture of the table

  holdbodi chose the moment for his last
defiance the sudreyarman was so over-
come by his rage that the words spat from
his lips with the hissing intonation of an
angry cat

  this is a rich reward for faithful friend-
ship and loyal service he snarled it
will make a brave tale swain men will
speak enviously of you as of one who takes
all and gives nothing who delights in
appropriating for himself that which his
friend desires you may succeed now
you may take ingrid-and much joy may

you have of her the- the last man

who has her ear is the one she will follow
you may send me forth no richer for the
fighting i have done in your behalf but
the time will come when you will regret it

i shall not forget

  swain heard him out

  if what you say was true holdbodi
he answered then you would have just
cause for resentment answer me this
am i the chief of our expedition

  holdbodi reluctantly admitted he was
  of five longships i led four

  yes but-

  and you have said you lost ten men
off jarlsness where my dead were numbered
by the score

  the sudreyarman made a final attempt
to regain his swagger

  if it had not been for me-

  you did no more than save your skin
bah jarl rognvald warned me against
trusting the sudreyarfolk but i would not
heed him yet i am not one to let any
man however unworthy leave me with
empty hands and seeing that there were
five longships with which we started i will
give you one-fifth of such movable booty
as we can take from man without injuring
the island together with the same share
of what was captured in olvirs ships
take that and go

 but the lands in man we all

helped-

  my offer will not hold open very long
holdbodi

  my own lands were wrecked by olvir
persisted holdbodi i am of a mind to
settle here and begin anew

  swain shook his head

  here you would make trouble he said
you will take what i offer and go

  i shall come again hissed the sudreyar-
man as he stumped to the door
swains sons

          vi

erik returned to the hall after
escorting the priest to the door
where is the bride he asked
grinning

  swain sitting at the high table with
young jarl harald thorar and leif roused
himself from the thoughts in which he had
been immersed

  i could not stand her chatter he
answered she is gone to her bower
did holdbodi make sail

  yes he steered out for irland at the
setting of the sun

  there was an interval of silence during
which the others peered secretly at swain
suddenly he raised his head

  jarl harald it is for you with thorar
and leif to return to orphir and carry
news to jarl rognvald of the issue of our
expedition

  they all spoke up in quick denial

  no no we stay with you swain ex-
claimed harald what leave you here

amongst strangers with a wife-

  he broke off but swain accepted the
implication without comment

  no harm can come to me he reassured
them i have erik here who will be
forecastleman for me when i go viking and
aid me in governing the manfolk and i have
plenty of my own stout carls left who will
stay on with me i can not keep jarl
rognvalds henchmen to help me carve out
a new fortune here he may have need
of them at home

  that may be true of thorar and leif
and their men clamored jarl harald
but there is no reason why i should not
remain with you swain jarl rognvald
gives me no share in governing the islands
and here i can learn far more with you
swain smiled for he had much love for
the boy

  no no he said i can not take on
myself the responsibility of guarding your
head as well as my own man will be no
place for young jarls to learn war-making
and statecraft while i am here you go
home with thorar and leif

  but what is your purpose swain
inquired thorar heavily it is known to
all of us that you already hold ample lands
in the orkneys this estate may be as rich

as a jarldom-

  seeing that it takes rank as a kingdom

and he who rules it is called king com-
mented erik in his dry way

  that may be that may be leif took
up the argument still swain can be
safer as a common boendr in gairsey than
as king in man and in gairsey he would
not have to own a shrew of a wife

  my reasons are sufficiently good said
swain now that gunni is dead i am
the last of my family and seeing the extent
of my feud with olvir it is possible that
doom may overtake me suddenly there-
fore i must have sons to follow me to exact
vengeance for me if necessary and to hold
my lands

  but you can have sons in gairsey as
well as in man objected jarl harald

  yes and if i go to gairsey now i shall
have to abandon man it is a rich land
and with peace for its folk and protection
against marauders it will become richer
also it is a good base for raids to irland
and bretland and the southern frankish
lands and here too i can watch all who go
up and down the waters of irlands haf
and so i can more readily come by news
of olvir rosta even than at home in the
orkneys until erik and i have put the
farmers back to work and taught marau-
ders to keep away i shall stay here after
that i can spend part of my time in the
orkneys

  and so we are to leave you by yourself
mourned young jarl harald

  swain patted the boys shoulder

  you will come again jarl rognvald
will send you south in the spring with
longships to join my viking cruises i will
employ the winters to mark down oppor-
tunities for plunder

  erik drained his ale-horn

  he is a wise man swain he remarked
but it is unfortunate he is not wise enough
to be able to secure another wife than
ingrid

  swains jaw set squarely

  do not concern yourself about her he
growled i will tame her with the butt of
my spear

  yes yes that is all very well grumbled
erik you can beat her but how are you
going to curb the evil vanity that is inside
her remember the trolls who strove to
capture the sunshine they are labor-
ing yet

  this erik himself was a very wise man
in after years accounted one of the wisest
adventure

who ever came into the orkneys with a
great store of runes and skalds sayings
and no small skill at verse-making he was
a strong friend to swain as shall be told
hereafter

vii

jarl harald with thorar and
leif sailed north at the end of the
summer to thorar swain gave
this message for asleif

  olvir rosta has taken gunnis life
this i could not help and you may be
sure that i shall not be slow to carry our
vengance to olvir when i discover where he
is also i have taken a wife in order
that i may have sons to inherit our lands
and preserve the feud if i perish for a
while i dwell in man but the orkneys will
see me again in the meantime i com-
mend you to the care of odin and the
blessed st magnus

  to jarl rognvald he likewise sent a mes-
sage by jarl harald

  if i do not sit with you at the high
table in the long nights this winter do not
forget me lord jarl for i shall live to be
with you again i am taking the counsel
you gave me concerning the getting of sons
if the booty i send you with your people
seems sufficient reward for their efforts let
me have thorar and leif next summer
for there are rich spoils to be secured in
these seas

  it is to be told in this connection that
jarl rognvald was much pleased with the
spoil swain sent to him and thorar and
leif not to speak of young jarl harald and
all their men spread the tidings of swains
new dignity and estate all through the
islands so that during the winter people
talked of very little else and it became a
saying-

  common man is king of man

  jarl rognvald never tired of questioning
the members of the expedition about
swains exploits and he delighted especially
to hear from jarl harald of ingrid

  that is a filly i would walk wide of
he would say but it is like swain to do
things differently from other men never-
theless i think he will be wise to watch
her closely

  asleif said nothing when swains message
was given to her except to inquire of
thorar what kind of woman ingrid was
and the best thorar could do was to mum-

ble that she was fair to look at but had a
strange temper

  swain will curb her answered asleif
proudly

  then she sent messengers through the
islands hiring men to aid her housecarls
to harvest the crops since they were short-
handed in gairsey and on swains lands in
caithness also by reason of the absence of
all those who had sailed with swain in the
spring men were quick to aid her be-
cause all desired to stand well in swains
estimation

  during the winter and the following
spring swain and erik were very busy
they established look-out stations on the
coasts of man to make it easier to discover
the approach of raiding-parties and swain
removed his residence from stikleborg to a
steading in the center of the island whence
he could shift his men readily in any direc-
tion he cncouraged the farmers to plant
full crops and gave assistance to such as
had suffered damage to their property
in this way he became very popular and
the manfolk gave him true allegiance

  he kept ingrid under guard of men he
could place confidence in the oldest and
most savage of his housecarls for he was
anxious that no harm should befall her
and he had his reward in the summer of the
next year when she gave birth to twin
boys olaf and andres he was so pleased
at this that he held an ale-drinking for his
men at which the guests sat for two days
and three nights and it was said there were
not five sober men on the island aside
from himself who drank nothing but water

  my luck has turned he said to erik
here are two swordsmen at a stroke

  why stop at two replied erik who
saw how his mind worked

  swain shook his head

  i have sufficient lands for two sons but
if i had more they would be fighting amongst
themselves

 a woman must raise children or
trouble warned erik

  i will take care that she is harmless
rejoined swain

  in truth ingrid was so occupied with her
twins that she was less trouble than she had
ever been and swain went viking cruising
in late summer with jarl rognvalds men
who had come south in three dragons
young jarl harald commanding his own
they gained much loot in irland and along
swains sons

the bretland coasts but nowhere did they
hear anything of olvir rosta who had dis-
appeared completely from those parts

  swain asked his friends from the ork-
neys if they had heard of holdbodi when
they traversed the sudreyar and they told
him that his former ally had never returned
to his ravaged lands swain set small
store by this information but erik gave
it much thought

  holdbodi left us with booty sufficient
to restore his property said the icelander
if he did not do so it was because he had
plans to use it otherwise

  he is a marauder who has no use for
lands returned swain

  no no swain all men crave land
what do the skalds say

           summer for the sea

              winter for the land

           work for the foot

             work for the hand

  at any rate he does not bother us so
we need not concern ourselves said
swain i am not afraid of a sudreyar
fox

  when the fox joined the wolf the farm-
yard was emptied said erik

  in the autumn of the year jarl harald
who was now grown much in stature and
wisdom and sweetness of character sailed
north with the orkneyfolk and swain and
erik turned their attention to harvesting
abundant crops swain looked forward
to a peaceful winter sitting about the
hearthfire with his chiefs talking over old
times and raids and fights and listening
to eriks recitation of sagas and wise
sayings he was a very restless domineer-
ing man fond of his will in all things and
he liked the sensation of being ruler of his
own dominions for friendly as he was at
home in the orkneys with jarl rognvald
there had been times when it irked him to
admit the suzerainty of another here in
man his word was law people did what he
bade them without question or suffered
the consequences only erik ever ques-
tioned him and the icelanders ripe wit
was ample excuse for independence but
ingrid would not have it that he should
dwell in peace and happiness apart from
her and when he resisted her first attempts
to sally from her bower and join him at
the high table or by the hearth she turned
on him like a treed wildcat

  all that you enjoy here you had of me
will you treat me like the cattle in the
stable

  if it suits me to replied swain simply
  she tossed back her black hair

  it is to be seen that you are a man of
great nobility she cried have i not
given myself to you and all that i own
is it so you reward a woman who put aside
others that there might be room for you
you did not give yourself i took you
answered swain as for others andrew
was slain and holdbodi i sent away be
quiet woman

  never while i have breath i am the

mother of your sons-

  and for that reason i permit you to bide
with me but do not strain my patience
or i will get rid of you

  she gaped at him almost believing that
he meant what he said so impassive was
his manner

  ah it is little you care for me or for
them she screamed sad will be their
lot with such a brute for father and i
am fittingly rewarded for the love and ser-
vice i have given you i who could have

wed with-

  you were for wedding the first man who
came hither with strength to take you
said swain now be silent

  silent never while i have strength
to tell you how i hate you you hairy beast
of the north there is cold green ice-
water in your veins and your eyes make
me think of the marshlights the evil spirits
send abroad to tempt us from the down
paths you are a great troll that some

wizard has put a spell upon and-

  at that swain could bear no more of her
and he took his spear from where it leaned
against the wall and beat her soundly with
the shaft until she was quite black-and-
blue and had tearfully promised that she
would do whatever he commanded and
not otherwise more than once in the
succeeding months he was obliged to threat-
en her but he never had occasion to beat
her a second time

  the winter passed without incident and
there was an unusually early g spring
jarl harald came from the orkneys with
four longships and proposed that this year
they should extend their viking cruise to
the coasts of vallandj and spainland and
as swain felt an itch for adventure after

   france
adventure

the dull months that had passed he con-
sented thinking too that in far-off waters
they might come upon a trace of olvir rosta

  this tale tells no more of swains cruise
with young jarl harald except that they
had with them seven dragons and acquired
much honor and considerable store of
plunder especially from a certain rich
city of the heathen in spainland they
parted company off the syllingar on their
home voyage jarl harald returning to the
orkneys by the east coast of bretland and
scotland and swain continuing direct to
man where he had left erik in charge of his
interests for lack of a substantial chief
among the manfolk

  erik climbed aboard deathbringer so
soon as swain beached his dragons on
stikleborg strand

  i perceive that you have had good for-
tune swain he said noting the chests of
cloth and jewels and valuable weapons and
armor which the crew were preparing to
shift ashore

  it was a profitable voyage answered
swain has all gone well here

  yes and no replied erik we have
had a visit from holdbodi

  you beat him off exclaimed swain
no ie came in peace openly he
asked for you saying that he was establish-
ing himself on lund and desired you to
know that he was there and that he hoped
to effect friendly terms with you

  humph said swain in any -case
he can do us no harm

  you are very foolish to say so re-
plied erik energetically holdbodi is not
one to forget a grudge

  if he could not harm you while i was
absent with so many men he can do no
harm with me here insisted swain
had he more than one ship

 two if he comes again-

  we shall be ready for him after the
harvest is in i will sail over to lund with
sufficient men and make certain of his
friendship

  yes that will be best agreed erik

viii

because of the early spring
there was an unusually bountiful
harvest that autumn and swain
and his men were hard put to it to gather

    lundy island in the bristol channel

in the crops before the northerly rains began
swain did all things thoroughly and he was
as careful in the matter of harvesting the
produce of his lands as he was in the con-
duct of his dragon at sea he distributed
the single men among his housecarls to
those farms which were most in need of
assistance and as soon as one farmers
crops were stored that farmer and his men
were sent to help another farmer in this
way the work went on apace

  he himself with his family and erik
dwelt in the steading at scaurfell near the
center of the island to which he had re-
moved at first in order to keep his main
force in a position whence it could be dis-
patched rapidly to any spot on the coasts
which was attacked by marauders he
was given to saying that a borg was good
enough for fighting purposes but it was
no place to live in by ordinary and an-
other reason for his preference for scaurfell
over stikleborg was that it enabled him to
supervise the several districts of the island
to better advantage

  scaurfell was just such a steading as
those he had left behind him in the ork-
neys there was a skalli with a chapel
and the customary barns and outhouses
and farther up the slope of the fell was a
small village swain of course lived in
the skalli he and erik slept together in
a chamber on the right of the entrance
across the hall was ingrids bower and the
room in which the two children slept a
handful of servants had quarters off the
kitchen and others were lodged in the out-
houses but there were very few housecarls
about because as has been said swain had
scattered them through the farms to help
in getting in the crops

  ingrid was quieter and less sullen than
her wont after swains return home and
she did not as she had the year before
oppose objections to moving from stikle-
borg erik commented upon this several
nights after their arrival at the steading
but swain laughed at him

  the irish cat has learned her lesson
he said we have no trouble with her
any longer

  erik wagged his head solemnly

  what did i say before he returned
a woman raises children or trouble

  she has children to raise answered
swain

  oh for those two she no longer has any
swains sons



care she leaves them all day to the
bower maidens and has since they were
weaned

  swain frowned

  i am glad you mentioned this he said
i should have realized that she was not
a proper person to rear them in the
spring i will send them north to my
mother asleif

  erik agreed that this would be a wise
policy and they turned their discussion
to the question of shedding over the dragons
at stikleborg arguing as to whether they
should leave all in the water until swain
had been to lund or drag up at once such
as he would not use they decided to
leave them in the water as the harvest
would be reaped by the end of the week
and in another week swain could compass
his voyage to lund then erik had a
last horn of ale and they went to bed

  toward morning swain was aroused by
a confused clamor outside the house his
couch was beneath a small window high
in the wall and parallel to the skallis
entrance door and he climbed upon a stool
to peer out there was a fog so that the
dark was dripping with pearly gray mois-
ture and it was impossible to see more than
a spears length off but swain had sharp
ears and he heard the shuffling of many
feet the muttering of voices and the oc-
casional clink of a sword-blade on shield
or mail-coat he did not stay to hear more
for he knew that visitors who approached
by stealth at that hour could be up to no
good

  he leaped softly from his perch and
crossed to eriks couch covering the ice-
landers mouth with one hand he whispered
in his ear-

  enemies at the door

  erik sat bolt upright and seized helm
sword and shield in three consecutive
movements from the stool beside him
who he whispered back

  i cannot see but there are many

  we can hold the skalli until help comes
from the outlying steadings suggested
erik

  no denied swain they would fire
us-and we must think of ingrid and the
sons come

  they slipped into the shadowy mystery
of the hall which was barely illumined
by the embers on the hearth and crossed it
to ingrids door inside the bower swain

felt his way to the couch and fumbled with
his hand to cover her lips lest she should
scream she was not there

  faintly he heard the creak of an open-
ing door the shuffling of feet on trodden
dirt the sh-shrring of trampled rushes
erik stole up beside him

  they are in swain

  yes and the irish cat leading them
muttered swain grimly

  erik made a quick pass over the couch

  at any rate she is not here he agreed
well do we die here swain or else-
where

  nowhere little man whispered swain
we will take the sons and flee

  there was a door between ingrids bower
and the chamber in which the children lay
on a stool in one corner a night lamp of
whale-oil burned one of the bower maid-
ens started up with fearful face clutching
her furs around her at sight of the two
armed men who stole through the shadows

  up girl commanded swain there
are enemies in the skalli take the babes

  she reached for robe and shoon but
swain shook his head

  there is no time haste

  he caught her arm and pulled her to
the outer wall of the room where high
under the eaves was another such window
as that through which he had spied upon
the enemies who had thought to surprize
him as he slept the girl-ragna by name
-he bundled up in his arms kicked a
stool before him to stand upon and thrust
her through the opening

  hold to my hands he bade her now
drop

  he turned and erik behind him held
up the squirming piles that were his sons

  good warriors these growled the
icelander they take bad luck without
yelping

  swain passed them out the window to
the maid without reply then hauled
himself through dropped to the ground
and turned to assist erik down as the
icelander dropped beside him there came
a shout from the hall

  torches here our birds have flown

  holdbodis voice exclaimed erik

  swain stood listening

  a second voice deeper mojre resonant
bitter with hatred called

  watch the rear make a ring carls
torches to smoke them outl


adventure

  ha mumbled swain that is olvir
rosta

  a womans voice wailed before erik
might answer him

  the devil is his friend after him
holdbodi or he will escape-and if he
gets free your life is not worth a rusty
dagger or mine either

  it seems that ingrid has had a hand in
this matter also commented erik

  swain cursed in his beard

  i will attend to all of them he snarled
her fears were not without cause but now
we must run from here as fast as we can
he and erik took the two children from
ragnas arms and with her ran in and out
between the scattered outbuildings of the
steading taking advantage of the shadows
until they came to a ravine which protected
them from observation here they halted
a moment watching the glare of flames
behind them and swain sent ragna to
raise a number of his housecarls who had
been lodged in an outlying barn erik
likewise ventured back a short distance
to call up a group of farmers and serving-
men who had been roused by the uproar
and were wandering about in bewilderment
one of these men had a ludr-hom and at
eriks suggestion he sounded it with all the
strength of his lungs

  presently ragna returned with the
housecarls from the bam and men began
to drift down from the village nearby
from the surrounding hills and valleys
came the blasts of other horns as the folk
of the different steadings were awakened
and passed on the alarm and swain
knew that very shortly he should have a
large force at his disposal so he bade
ragna take the children and hide them in a
little wood and with the men who had
joined him he climbed up from the ravine
and took his stand upon a hillside within
view of the flames of scaurfell steading

  see how foolish it is to plot any deed
with a woman he said as the invaders
caught sight of his party and commenced
to stream toward them she told them
that they could surprize me and they be-
lieved that they could and therefore they
did not even stop to cast a ring around the
skalli as they would have had they acted
alone i have had my fill of women
erik they are stones about mens necks
some men must have sons rejoined
erik

  and having them need no longer be
burdened answered swain savagely
when this is over i will give ingrid fitting
punishment

  give her to holdbodi suggested erik
punish both of them

  i will place her where she can no longer
make trouble for men said swain

 humph said erik we have not
yet caught her

  we will replied swain with confidence
i shall meet the onset with these men here
in the meantime do you leave us and
gather together our friends as they come
up then instead of falling upon hold-
bodi and olvir in scattered parties they
can strike all together and in that way we
shall shatter our enemies

  erik said this was a wise plan although
he was reluctant to abandon swain to
confront such odds as he must meet at
first but he finally agreed to it and ran off
just as olvir and holdbodi came to the
foot of the hillside their men were con-
siderably winded and they rested for a
while before they commenced to climb the
hill in order to come at swains company
who had formed a shield-ring upon the
very summit of the hill thus having the
advantage of being able to strike down at
their enemies who must always be a little
distance below them

  when olvir who was a warrior of much
prowess and craft perceived swains plan
he arrayed his men in a solid column and
ordered holdbodi to do likewise with his
sudreyarmen there were upwards of
three hundred of the invaders and swain
with all the accessions that had come to him
had no more than a fourth as many but
swain had as much craft as olvir and as
soon as he saw where the two attacking
columns must strike he concentrated his
people at those points leaving only a thin
screen of men to guard the rest of the hilltop

  olvir and holdbodi tramped leisurely
up the hill by now the darkness had
lifted but the fog persisted and everything
showed gray and indistinct olvirs men
icelanders and outlaws of all the north
countries loomed gigantic in the mist
holdbodis folk showed like distorted
hairy gnomes their eyebrows their mous-
taches their garments even their weapons
dripped with moisture

  at the break of the hill the attackers
halted and olvir stepped from their ranks
swains sons



his squat figure with immensely long arms
distorted out of all proportion by the tricky
light

  stand forth swain he called i
have waited for long this hour

  swain stepped from the shield-wall

  it is to be seen that you finally became
tired of running away olvir he answered
you have gained little honor in recent
years

  yet it was you who ran today retorted
olvir the others of your family did not
flee when i slew them there were your
father and valthiof they came out of the
skalli at dungelsbae to die upon our steel
and gunni stood to the last on seabroths
poop only you fled from me you whose
sole vengeance has been to burn frakork
my mother an old woman

  and a foul witch replied swain with
heat it ill becomes you to talk of run-
ning you who feared to meet me alone in
deathbringer ship to ship after the fight off
jarlsness there never was a time olvir
when you would fight any man with equal
numbers you must always come by
stealth in the dark

  there was a hiss-ss-s in the fog and a
spear clanged into swains shield

  who cast that cried he

  yes who cast it demanded olvir
did i not say swain was to be saved for
me

  i threw it answered holdbodis voice
after a slight interval there is too much
delay slay swain and be done with it

   swain laughed in derision

  it is not in you to slay me holdbodi
he mocked nor any other

  men will say differently tomorrow
returned holdbodi and tomorrow i
shall sit in your place with ingrid beside
me

  swain snatched up the spear from the
ground at his feet

  what is that you say he shouted

  holdbodi grew bolder and swaggered
out of the fog until he stood revealed
against the dim ranks of his followers

  i say that ingrid who arranged our
coming here so that she might be rid of
you swain will sit with me in your place
tonight he boasted and we will laugh
often as we speak together-

  swain flung the spear at him with such
violence that it drove through his thigh
below the bottom of his mail shirt and

pierced the soft ground of the hillside to a
depth of two palms pinning holdbodi on
liis side his shriek of pain was eerie in
the moist grayness

  i think you will pass your evening in
another wise remarked swain and
now what have you to say olvir

  this returned olvir casting his spear

  olvir rosta was the most powerful
spear-thrower in the north also swain
had not had time to don his mail-shirt
before fleeing from the skalli and he knew
that while he might be able to fend hold-
bodis spear with his shield olvirs would
strike through shield and all but the stoutest
armor so he cast himself to one side
upon the ground and olvirs spear flew
over him slaying one of the farmers in
the shield-wall behind him

  swain sprang nimbly to his feet

  try again olvir he cried that
was mis-cast

  the ax is surer returned olvir taking
that weapon from his belt fall 
afl

  a great shout answered him and his
men poured up the hill at his back in a dense
mass holdbodis men too came on at
the word but they had lost heart when
their leader fell and they did not strike
the shield-wall with the same impact as
the icelanders who as many skalds have
sung are the stoutest of warriors being
for the most part men of good blood and
inured to all manner of hardships

  the men swain had told off to meet the
sudreyarfolk held them with little difficulty
at the verge of the hill but when olvirs
column hit the shield-wall it bent in not-
withstanding the best efforts of swain
himself who met olvir blade to blade
there was a great clattering of weapons and
a mighty stamping and shouting and the
heavy air became impregnated with the
sour smell of sweating bodies and the hot
acrid stench of blood gaps opened in
the shield-wall and at swains shouted
summons men flew from other points to
stop them the line receded step by
step stopped swayed forward for an in-
stant then gave ground again as the ir-
resistible weight of superior numbers began
to tell

  with a shout the tail of olvirs column
flowed round the scantily-guarded flank of
swains wall and smote it in the rear-
and it flew to pieces what had been an


adventure

ordered battle men fighting shield to shield
in regular formation became a scattered
affair of individual and group combats
swain himself gathered a dozen men who
were nearest to him and strove to carry
the fight to the enemy hewing through their
ranks in an effort to come up with olvir
who was raging across the hilltop scatter-
ing death with his huge ax

 but his vengeance was not to be
achieved a great wail came suddenly
from where the sudreyarfolk pounded the
remnants of swains other detachment and
the jubilant shouting of many men in
the fog

  run run the islandmen are upon

us

  at them swains folk

  hold swain that was eriks voice
we are coming

  olvir rosta stayed his advance head
cocked on one side to listen then his
bull voice boomed over the confusion

  olvirs men to the strand to the
ships all my folk

  bide olvir shouted swain hoarsely
stand to it

  olvir laughed as he ran over the edge of
the hill

  this is your day after all swain
another time

  be a man you cur wait you shall
fight me man to man the winner to go
free

  but no answer came from the mist and
swain stumbling in pursuit almost fell
upon the spears of his own people rushing
along the side of the hill after the wreck
of holdbodis men they recognized him
in time and with him to lead them took
up the pursuit of the enemy past the
steading a charred ruin outhouses still
smoldering past a little group of women
clustered around one who wrung her hands
and moaned past stray corpses and dis-
carded weapons on to a road which led to
a disused cove on the southeastern coast
men reinforced the pursuit at every cross-
road dropped from every cliff appeared
from scaur and gulley but olvir was
wary and warwise at each defensible
place he left a small guard of berserk
fighters who died to the last man to give
their comrades time to escape

  by mid-morning the mist was gone and
a watery sun shone down upon the running
fight but it was of scant use to swain

and served principally to enable him to
watch the embarkation of his enemies upon
three dragons which were pushed off from
the beach before his men were even within
arrowshot helpless himself because his
longships were miles away at stikleborg
he stood at the waters edge in sullen resent-
ment and raised his sword in a last gesture
of defiance far across the leaden waters
a figure leaped upon the stern gunwale of
the rearmost ship and likewise heaved an
ax aloft no words could have carried
across that broadening gap but both men
read the meaning without effort implied
threat and promise in one

ix

sjjjhl when swain returned to scaurfell
jftsj he was met by erik and a multitude
of the manfolk

  we have holdbodi and ingrid secured
in a barn here said erik what is it
your pleasure to do with them

  fetch out holdbodi replied swain
briefly

  the sudreyarman was carried from the
barn and placed on the ground in the full
glare of the fire by which swain sat he
was unable to walk or stand erect because
of the wound in his thigh but he groveled
on his face in front of swain and pleaded
for mercy

  mercy replied swain i will show
you as much mercy as i would a fox i found
raiding the poultry

  but i will tell you everything pro-
tested holdbodi i will tell you where
olvir is fled to

  tell commanded swain

  and holdbodi fearfully whined out the
story of how olvir rosta had come to him
secretly at liodhus in the past winter and
suggested that they operate together to
slay swain and seize his possessions in
man and how in the spring they had
both met with their men at lund and
fortified themselves there and as soon as
they had determined that swain was gone
on his usual viking cruise he holdbodi
had been sent to spy out the land

  it was she who plotted last nights
deed he clamored it was not i swain
she planned it all  she told me where we
should land how we should approach the
house she promised to let us in without
rousing you she-
swains sons



 when did she promise this broke in
 swain when you saw erik at stikle-
 borg

 no she made a sign to me during that
 visit to come again and i came in the night

 afterward and-

 when how

 two nights after we pretended to
 sail away but we did not go far and the
 second night we returned and i landed
 quietly and climbed the walls of the borg
 and rapped upon her window

 swains face was blacker than ever
 none knew of this

 i told olvir afterward he-he-

 what said he

 no you-

 swain glowered down at him

 tell

 he said i should have her and a fair
 half of the island

 and she

 she was-was-willing oh dont slay
 me swain ill be thrall to you ill

 serve you as none-

 take the snake away and make an end
 of it ordered swain curtly

 holdbodis shrieks were smothered in
 the darkness

 and what of ingrid inquired erik
 curiously

 swain roused himself

 yes bring her forth and muster three
 ships crews we march to stikleborg
 at once

 when erik led out his prisoner sullen-
 faced and vicious she flared at him

 go on make an end of me you can
 tell swain i did not fear him

 erik surveyed her quizzically

 swain is gone on before lady it may
 be he will acquaint you with your doom
 later

 doom she spat what doom at
 the worst he can slay me

 it is in my mind that you are very ig-
 norant concerning your husband replied
 the icelander

 and no more would he say to her how-
 ever she badgered him

 they came to stikleborg and weary
 as they all were with marching and fighting
 swain bade run out deathbringer and two
 other longships loaded them full of men
 with necessary provender and headed
 southeast for lund with a favoring wind
 the rest of that night and the next day

most of-the crews slept lying upon rowing-
benches and in gangways but thereafter-
ward they were refreshed and they con-
tinued toward their destination without
any untoward incident

  ingrid was confined in the poop-cabin
of deathbringer she saw none save
erick who carried her food and water
twice she called through the door to swain
but the second time he came to her with
such a look upon his face that she cowered
screaming in the farthest corner of the
cabin

  lund they drew blank there were
signs that olvir had stopped there after
his flight from man for the stores inside
the borg which he and holdbodi had built
were sorely depleted but no human being
remained to tell which way he had gone
and swain without a word ordered his
ships run out and continued southward

  three days later despite contrary winds
they came at nightfall to the syllingar and
ran into the harbor of the island wherein
was situated the monastery at which swain
had stopped once before he summoned
erik with a dozen men to attend him had
ingrid brought from the poop and landed

  what is this place she babbled peer-
ing about her at the wild mingling of sea
and sky and the insignificant dots of land
between

  nobody answered her

  will you murder me here swam
she cried was it too much kindness to
slay me at home or to drown me in the sea
must you carry me to this wretched haunt
of devils and-

  swain looked at her and she became
still sobbing to herself in a frenzy of fear

  at the monastery gate swain spoke with
the gray-bearded old monk who had told
him of having witnessed the passage of
olvirs dragon escaping from the fray
off jarlsness

  i have a woman here said swain
simply i desire you to keep her for
me

  the monk tossed up his hands in horror

  impossible it is against our vows
even to look at a woman

  i might burn your monastery con-
sidered swain aloud

  the monk grasped his sleeve

  no no you need only sail on to the
next island-that little one where the light
twinkles in the east there is a house of


adventure

holy women where your charge could be
well cared for

   could she get out demanded swain
 get out why she would not want
 to-

   she might i must be certain that she
 stays where i place her

   that you must arrange with the abbess
 replied the monk doubtless a suitable

gift- 

   or a sincere threat remarked swain
 i grasp your meaning and let me cau-
 tion you to use your influence with the
 abbess to cause her to obey the commands
 i lay upon her for if for any cause this
 woman escapes i shall hold your establish-
 ment as well as hers to blame and i will
 not leave one stone standing upon another
 late that night the abbess of the nun-
 nery on the adjoining island the most
 remote establishment of religion in all the
 world was called to her gate by a party of
 helmed vikings whose heavy tread and
 clashing weapons sent a shiver of dread
 from end to end of her house to her
 swain explained his needs

   this woman is my wife she is a bad
 woman she is a source of trouble for
 men she is vain and wicked and selfish
 and she thinks only of herself i wish you
 to take her among you and keep her for
 the rest of her days she is never to pass
 your walls again

   he paused and took from one of his men
 a heavy leathern bag which he emptied

 	before the abbess eyes a torrent of
 jewels and precious things cascaded from it

   this will pay for your trouble he
 added

   his terrible cold blue eyes bored into
 the old womans pale face

   i am swain olafs son he said you
 will have heard of me no man stands
 before me and lives do what i say and
 i will see that your establishment is un-
 harmed by the viking folk let this woman
 get away from you and i will wreck your
 house and sell you and your people into
 slavery in serkland
 the abbess bowed

   it shall be done she promised you
 need have no fear

   erik led forward ingrid to the abbess side
 i wish you joy of her lady remarked
 the icelander she is a rough-mouthed
 filly

      north africa

   the abbess gave her a chill look

  we have ways to handle such she

said

   ingrid burst into a passion of wailing
swain swain swain will you bury 
me alive in my youth will you give me
to a living death

  yes replied swain for you would
have buried me in very death and your
sons with me you fool do you think
olvir rosta would have let children of
mine live

  and he turned on his heel and departed
heedless of the screams that followed him
no man ever saw the lady ingrid again
she goes out of this story as she went out
of swains life and out of the world of
living folk a veil shut her off from her
kind

x

swain sold his lands in man
together with all the rights per-
taining to them to a bretland jarl
and with such of the manfolk as cared to
share his lot and his own housecarls and his
two sons he went north in that autumn
to the orkneys

  i am no man to dwell an outlander
he said to jarl rognvald who welcomed
him gladly and i would rather be a
plain boendr in the orkneys than king in
man for a man savors the true zest of life
only among his own kind

  your words prove to me that you have
gained in wisdom swain replied the
jarl merrily and if you care to take an
orkney wife i am sure that bishop william

will see that the necessary-

  one marriage is enough interrupted
swain having lived through it i am
not of a mind to tempt the gods again
i have enough to do in raising my sons and
caring for my property aside from the
fact that i have yet to slay olvir rosta
that is a bad business said jarl
rognvald soberly if you and olvir do
not slay each other shortly one or the other
of you you are like to be the death of
every one in the north

  what i can i do returned swain
shrugging his shoulders

  nevertheless what jarl rognvald said
was true as all men agreed in future years
this feud was a sorry burden to folk who
had not been born when it began

from orphir swain journeyed to gairsey
little known history



where his mother greeted him with much
pride to her alone he bent his head

  i have fared ill mother he said i
have let olvir slay gunni and twice more
escape me but i have brought you two
sons to succeed us and we are richer for
my venturings

  asleif kissed his forehead

  gunni died sword in hand a ring of slain
around him she answered her lined face
very serene no man could ask more
nor could a mother desire a better death
for her son we will endeavor to bring up
these younglings to be worthy to take his
place as for olvirs escape well i know
it did not happen for want of your efforts
for the next few years swain remained
at home improving his lands and purchas-
ing additional property in caithness and
hrossey all men who came to him he

received into his employ at gairsey he
maintained eighty housecarls at his own
expense and he reared upon his estate here
a drinking-hall larger than any other in
the north where the mead bowl and the
ale-barrel stood free and open from winters
beginning to winters end he had much
honor sitting always between jarl rognvald
and jarl harald when they dispensed jus-
tice and his sons grew into sturdy lads

  those were the pleasantest years of his
life olvir rosta men reported had gone
to mikligard where he took service in
the vaering guards of the greek emperor
and soon won high rank so that for a space
peace reigned in the orkneys and young
men who desired adventure had to fare
overseas with jarl harald who was viking
bound every spring

little known history

by c b watson

jring the war of  manuel
lisa the first of the great fur-
traders was made sub-agent by
the government and allowed five
hundred dollars a year salary for his efforts
in restraining the upper missouri indians
from joining with those of the upper mis-
sissippi in warring against the united
states that lisa did not profit financially
by this meager stipend is evidenced by the
fact it did not pay for the tobacco he gave
away each year among the uneasy tribes

  one of the great problems confronting
our government was to get messengers
through to the upper mississippi with a
peace-pipe and talk for the malcontents
the sacs and fox indians were so hostile it
was impossible for the messenger to pass
through their country and it was necessary
to start the messenger up the missouri to
some point above the omahas thence
across to st peters river in minnesota

  governor clarks first messenger offering
peace was the one-eyed sioux one of the
very few upper mississippi sioux who was
friendly to the americans the one-
eyed sioux offered his services to governor
clark of missouri when he learned that joe

renville and little crow were to lead a
big band of warriors against the americans
receiving his commission and a peace talk
he went with lisa up the missouri to the
river jacques james river s dakota and
crossed to prairie du chien where he was
seized and imprisoned and threatened with
death he refused to tell his errand fi-
nally liberated he visited various sioux
tribes and delivered his message

  the peace commissioners were still hard
at work trying to send more messengers
through few men cared to volunteer for
the dangerous task joseph la barge
father of captain joseph la barge whose
biography is a history of the white man on
the missouri did try but could not pene-
trate the sac and fox country but a
lieutenant kennedy did make the trip
via the missouri and prairie du chien the
route followed by the one-eyed sioux

  lisa held the missouri tribes in hand but
spent no time with peace-pipes he organ-
ized a strong war-party and hurled them
against great britains allies the iowas
when peace was declared lisa had several
thousand indians about to take a path
against the mississippi tribes
   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and pooradventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in  far land

    perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

    if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

a rthur o friel comes across with
several things in connection with his
novelette in this issue

  there are a few sizable chunks of truth in the
thirty gang for instance

a couple of years ago ramn rodriguez his
real name a foreman for a san fernando
balata man attacked an indian girl on the cunu-
cunuma except for the fact that he did not at-
tempt to carry her to the orinoco but left her in
the bush what followed was exactly as i have
related the avengers made no attack on ramns
crew they got the guilty man and got him very
thoroughly and then they turned back into the
jungle and let the crew go out to tell the tale
they knew perfectly what that meant too so
when they returned to their tribe-house they calmly
gathered their effects and vanished into the mys-
terious mountains to the north they have never
come back

  the raid of coronel bayona in the maquiritare
country via the caura and the ventuari with its
accompanying brutality also is fact he did not

carry men down the river as slaves however it
was an expedition of wanton murder and fiendish-
ness against unsuspecting indian dogs un-
fortunately there was no black white to take his
trail and he traveled fast enough to evade retribu-
tion from the unorganized maquiritares during
one of his halts he had a maquiritare prisoner tied
to a tree and beaten to death merely for his amuse-
ment he himself was one of tomds funes boot-
licking brutes hence the self-conferred tide of
coronel and when his boss was killed he fled
to brazil i hope somebody has shot him before
now but as i am not sure of it i am changing his
name

  another san fernando gang who later started
up the ventuari however had to turn tail before
they came within many miles of the maquiritare
hills in spite of their guns they got thoroughly
licked by a bunch of yavaranos and most of them
became food for the caribes instead of returning to
san fernando

  working balata by terrorizing and enslaving
indians is very old stuff in the up-orinoco country
its still done-oh lord yes the indians fight
back when they can and some tribes have proved
themselves distinctly dangerous to meddle with


the camp-fire



tn a way im sorry that i have to portray the
men of san fernando de atabapo in such an
unfavorable light as previously stated i got
along very well with those who were in the town
when i was there and some of them were darned
good scouts at the same time the place is what
it is and in funes time it was what it was and
theres no getting away from facts if i tried to
depict that burg as anything else than a mur-
derers roost at any rate between  and 
which is the time of this story id be a liar and a
fool paco pelddm and jaime pecoro and their
gangs were types only too well known in the rio
negro country

  the rifle accident which diego tries on loco-
lzn is old stuff in san fernando in fact if
theres any form of plain or fancy assassination
unknown to that town its one thats been forgotten
since prehistoric days

  there was one real man in funes army-the
amalio lopez mentioned in this tale that was his
real name and he is an unsung hero he fought to
the last for funes and when he fell mortally
wounded he refused to have his wounds stanched
preferring to die in the service of his doomed
coronel it was a noble sacrifice for a most ig-
noble master

as for the poison used by loco len-well
let an old-time adventurer tell it-sir walter
raleigh who in  journeyed a little way up the
orinoco and had a tough time of it in his report
on what he learned there he stated

  there was nothing whereof i was more curious
than to find out the true remedies of these poisoned
arrows for besides the mortality of the wound
they make the party shot endureth the most in-
sufferable torment in the world and abideth a most
ugly and lamentable death sometimes dying stark
mad sometimes their bowels breaking out of their
bellies which are presently discoloured as black as
pitch and so unsavory as no man can endure to
cure or to attend them and it is more strange to
know that in all this time there was never spaniard
either by gift or torment that could attain to the
true knowledge of the cure although they have
martyred and put to invented torture i know not
how many of them

   sir walter ascribes the use of this infernal stuff
to another tribe of indians than the maquiritares
but that does not mean that the maquiritares and

the maquiritares themselves were unknown to sir

far as the rio caroni about sixty miles below the
present ciudad bolivarand saw only those indians

which i personally came into contact down there
except that in the systems of sundry snakes which
came a-visiting was the curare commonly used by
the blowgun sharpshooters-and i took good care
that none of that got under my hide but i have
little doubt that those usually good-natured sons
of the highlands could if they wished produce a

the anti-tobacco crusaders probably would in-

black brazilian tobacco rolled in rectangles of

ran out of cigarets and eke of rice papers and
labari and the only thing smokable left was that
brazilian tobacco obtained at san fernando and
very scarce and precious there wrapped in scraps
of adventure the combination was so strong it
nearly knocked us cock-eyed but we not only
survived-we got so used to it that when we came
out to a point where we could again buy regular
venezuelan cigarrillos which are pretty stiff
smokes we grumbled because they had no
punch

  i do not recommend this combination except
to desperate men anybody desiring to try it out
however can get about the same effect by smoking

good suggestions for organizing the

  some time ago when temporarily editing the
local newspaper and after reading what you had
to say in re the anti-weapon law i wrote an
editorial setting forth the situation and bring-
ing to the attention of the readers of the paper
largely composed of isolated small farmers what
such a law would mean to them and their women-
folks 

jomment on the editorial was without a dis-
senting voice that such a law would expose
the women of the south to untold danger would
be resisted by force if necessary and would lead
to a great increase in lynchings and other measures
of vengeance possibly against innocent persons
owing to the feelings engendered by the rapidly
increasing outrages which would undoubtedly occur

  many commentors stated that in their opinion no
sane legislative body would consider an act which
would be so fatal to the safety of the large body of
isolated country women throughout the south and
southwest the mere idea of such a law being even
considered was beyond their understanding

something from william byron

we wrote asking him for its exact meaning

is so very plain and obvious that we missed
it altogether

  perhaps you know that the quebecquois in the
days of radisson began to call themselves habi-
tants to distinguish themselves from the roving
bush-lopers and from the fishermen who went back
to france in winter the term is still universally
used the labradorite translated the word into
i

adventure

livyeres live here to distinguish themselves
from the newfoundland cod fishermen who visit
the coast for a few months in summer and from
the wandering fur-hunters so livyere means
a familied man who lives on the coast the year
around or a trapper or hunter who is settled about
a fort or trading station

  i anticipate somebody rising and yelling that
kiliutok or pilintok means an innuit instru-
ment more like a meat-chopper than a knife
kiliutok has been taken over from the innuit
and means almost any kind of knife from the
oo-ldr-ra a womans dainty garment cutter to the
wulu big skin-scraper though it is usually
applied to a bone or ivory-handled skinning in-
strument with a slightly bowed back thick blade
and keen point-in other words an abbreviated
but vicious simitar-w byron mowery

the following is much much too deep
for me though i like its plea for inde-
pendent thinking anyhow it bears on our
previous discussion concerning the ark of
the covenant and having once burst into
the realm of metaphysics and the psychic

sion any of you who may be particularly
interested are asked to write to mr thorn-

aurora illinois

  referring to the letter signed anna brockway
gray m d in camp-fire regarding some of the
theories worked out in some of talbot mundys
stories which i have read with keen interest i want
to call the writers attention to the works of baron
karl von rickenbach an austrian dr karl von
prel a german and colonel de rochas a span-
iard on the subject of odic or odylic em-anations
some of the laws deducible regarding same together
with many interesting and curious experiments
and also to the works of boirac joire and broquet
along similar lines

true all these theories and researches were
carelessly rejected after scant consideration
because they failed to he comfortably in the bed of
the sophomoric science of a generation ago more
recent scientific progress however has demon-
strated that many things prematurely rejected con-
tained sound scientific truth the x-ray demon-
strated the existence of recordable light vibrations
far beyond the range of our human senses radium
and the breaking down of the atom demonstrated
that alchemy and the transmutation of metals
which a generation ago were considered as su-
premely ridiculous are not merely possibilities but
probabilities to be reckoned with in the immediate
future laying the whole science of chemistry open
for wide revision diacyanin slides proved the
existence of aura beyond the scoffing-of the incredu-
lous old time alchemy premised as axiomatic the
existence of four terrestrial elements fire water
earth and air and one celestial element the ether
and science hard pressed to escape its own inevit-
able conclusions resulting from the non-continuity
of physical or ponderable matter has always
accepted the ether as a continuous imponderable

fluid substance filling all space not otherwise occu-
pied particularly the intermolecular and inter-
atomic space the existence of which was inescapable
in view of the laws of non-continuity density and
penetrability it is this realm of the ether that we
are at last beginning to invade

  it is now generally conceded that every living
individual is surrounded by an envelope of radiant
animal magnetism or biogen the existence of which
although composed of ordinarily invisible intangible
imponderable essences is none the less perfectly
susceptible of proof this is apparently what dr
gray refers to as atmosphere although it is more
usually called aura and was first observed and
treated of in modern times about the middle of the
last century by the writers above mentioned as
biod the knowledge of it is however far older
than the middle of the last century for the theory
of animism runs back like alchemy to the lost
sciences of the ancients atmosphere aura od or
odyl and the ether being closely related to the
akasha of the sankhya the alkahest of paracelsus
the generative fire of heraclitus the telsma of
hermes the living fire of zoroaster and the astral
light of the kabala

t et us therefore approach the subject with ah
open mind as befits our day and age realizing
although we still lack much that must be redis-
covered before we can understanding piece to-
gether the garbled fragments which have come down
to us of ancient learning that the so-called occult
sciences of the middle ages were but the distorted
remains of half forgotten misunderstood truths
which had been lost through disuse and misuse the
real verities of which we are from day to day little
by little stumblingly reclaiming and re-establishing
in the course of the triumphant pnward sweep of
our own advanced scientific progress

  certainly peculiarly sensitive persons in every
generation have been psychically clairvoyant to the
point of seeing od or aura more or less distinctly but
in the main they have been ridiculed and openly
discredited by those less fortunate in their endow-
ments with the natural result that undoubtedly
many who have had such powers have kept the fact
scrupulously to themselves both failing to develop
their powers and frequently losing them through
disuse rather than suffer ignominiously at the hands
of skeptical materialism however with the advent
of diacyanin slides it became possible for practically
every one to see it more or less clearly and prove
its existence for themselves unfortunately con-
siderable eye-strain results from the protracted use
of this artificial stimulus moreover the ability
to see by its use varies considerably with different
individuals so we must still remain largely depend-
ent upon those gifted individuals having natural
abilities along these lines for the data relative to
these phenomena and as such persons are compara-
rively rare and usually without sufficient scientific
training to make reliable observations and classify
the data arising out of them the obstacles to intelli-
gent research are still colossal if you will read
the country of the blind you will better grasp
the manifold difficulties of the situation indeed
not until we begin to pick out and specially educate
those endowed with these special powers the same
as we do our musicians and artists etc can we
reasonably expect to make much real progress along
these lines
the camp-fire



yktth all this in mind we will now proceed to
consider what has been authoritatively laid
down regarding od or aura both in conjunction with
and apart from the entity or entities generating it

  first it is cumulative that is it can be accumu-
lated or stored up in suitable media just as static
electricity can be accumulated or stored up in a
leyden jar or the emanations from radium can
be absorbed or stored up in water etc and when
so charged with od the media is said to be odylized

  second this od is surcharged with the mental
attitude of the individual or individuals furnishing
it at the time of odylization and its power and
activity will vary directly with the concentration
and intensity of their mentality or mentalities at
such time

  third such a charge of od can be either addfed to
or discharged in whole or in part from time to time
the same as a charge of electricity in a leyden jar

  fourth such a charge of od like a charge of
static electricity tends to gradually dissipate itself
as time passes the length of time any medium is
capable of retaining its effective odylization depend-
ing upon the nature of the medium and the strength
of the charge of od originally or subsequently ac-
cumulated

the next phase to consider is that individuals
affect one another some consciously but most
unconsciously by their od aura or atmosphere
without spoken or written word look or action
this is because od is a product of the subconscious
and not of the conscious mind and consequently
does not depend for its interaction upon the sensory
nervous system the ancients keenly appreciated
this and believed that it radiated from the solar
plexus which they therefore termed the sun or the
light of the body groups of individuals all con-
centrating on a group idea or purpose naturally
develop a much greater odic force frequently in
fact sweeping all except exceptionally isolated or
insulated individuals along with them like waters
in a flood witness a panicky day on change a relig-
ious revival or the coalesccnt mind of a mob

  everything we wear or use particularly those
things we wear in contact with our bodies becomes
more or less odylized or impregnated with our
personality or atmosphere and we leave a constant
trail of it behind us wherever we go just like scent
places and things frequently become odylized in
varying degrees and where strong emotions have
repeatedly released similar odic charges over con-
siderable periods this atmosphere is distinctly
noticeable it is easy to be brave in a pirates cave
reckless in a gambling den or reverent in a cathe-
dral in fact it is difficult to be otherwise

aj any of the peculiar religious customs and
beliefs especially those dating back to the
primitive churches and worships are based on the
lost knowledge of odic forces and charges this
was the real reason behind the ark of the covenant
the breastplate of the high priest the roman eagles
and the russian icons the faith in the efficacy of
amulets charms fetishes and sacred relics and
the use of the chrism and holy water together with
the stations of the cross which in the early church
were merely twelve specially selected points around
the church marked by a cross cut in the stone upon
which the chrism was splashed in dedicating the edi-
fice because the ancients knew the advantages of

using visible fulcrums upon which to concentrate
the mentality of the masses the whole worship
of idols and and reverence for sacred images vou-
douism and envoutement in effigy and the old-
time belief in the efficiency of blessings and cursings
are likewise remnants of the same lost knowledge
for all these things to-day among civilized peoples
are in themselves but empty forms save as our own
personal belief may lend them artificial force unto
ourselves only

a ll this brings us directly to the question
raised regarding the ark ofthe covenant and
other possible similar phenomena such as tutankh-
amens tomb etc during the time it was in
regular use and for an indeterminate period there-
after it is not only possible but probable that due
to the heavy odic charge in and upon it the ark of
the covenant could and did kill the profane who
opened it and brought disaster to whoever laid
unlawful hands upon it regardless of their knowl-
edge or beliefs concerning it just as radium would
bum and if the quantity was sufficient kill any one
not handling it properly today the priesthood
including the levites knew of course just how to
protect themselves and were consequently not
harmed just as those of our scientists using radium
or the x-ray have learned how to safeguard them-
selves and their patients

    therefore if the ark of the covenant with all its
original charge of odic force still intact could be
placed before one of us today and we even in com-
plete ignorance of what it was violated it i firmly
believe we would pay the penalty but we must
remember that this force like a charge of static
electricity tends constantly to dissipate itself and
consequently must at intervals be renewed now
it is improbable that this has been done with the
lost ark of the covenant so that if it is still in
existence it has probably long ago lost almost all
the powers it at one time undoubtedly possessed
however if a sufficient remnant of them did still
exist in it due to some secret of its construction it
would now harm jew or gentile alike because the
secret knowledge of controlling these forces is as
much lost to the hebrew priesthood of today as it
is to us

por the same reason it appears improbable that
lord carnarvon died as a result of the effects
of a malific charge of odic force accumulated in or
on something in or about tutankhamens tomb or
vested in an elemental artificially created for that
purpose although sealed from contact as it has
been such a thing might not be impossible re-
member radium salts once isolated and refined will
continue to give off their emanations almost
indefinitely and you will more readily grasp the
point because we are entirely without reliable data
regarding the lasting possibilities of odic charges
generated by mass or group monoideism

    egypt in the height of her power possessed almost
superhuman knowledge but misused it as atlantis
had done aforetime and consequently like atlantis
slowly but surely destroyed herself moses who
led the children of israel out of egypt was skilled
in all the secret lore of the egyptians and appears
to have introduced considerable of it made over
into the hebrew forms of worship and life unfor-
tunately at the time moses acquired this knowledge
the egyptians were already misusing or abusing
io

adventure

their powers because whenever these powers are
turned to selfish or destructive uses they eventually
and inevitably react upon those so misusing them

  consider the whole series of miracles wrought
upon the egyptians by moses each more destruc-
tive than its predecessor and you will gain some
faint appreciation of how terribly malific these
forces can be when turned to destructive uses
observe also that while the egyptian priests
were able in part to duplicate the doings of
moses their works were always markedly inferior
and you will perceive that they had been losing
while moses had been gaining power and since so
great a difference could develop within the brief
span of a human life there seems scarce room to
longer doubt the old legend of the destruction of
lost atlantis as the culminating episode of the
selfish internecine struggle among their priesthood
misusing their almost superhuman powers lastly
note that both moses and the egyptians began their
wonder works with the serpent clearly proving the
familiarity of both with the black magic of the
rites of menroe then consider all the various
miracles of christ wherein the same power was
invariably used in a constructive manner and you
will appreciate the wonderful possibilities of these
powers for good and do not forget that christ per-
sistently refused even in the last extremity to loose
his powers destructively against his persecutors

a pparently the ancient lore was never
taught in the clear cold step-by-step fashion of
our sciences of today which are forever patiently
struggling to lay bare the exact cause behind each
effect the vast majority who learned these things
did so as the average person learns to use a radio
set with little definite comprehension of how or
why it really works they came to know that
certain combinations produced certain results
and did not in the main concern themselves how
or why further their practises usually contained
a large surplusage of non-essentials which grew
steadily by accretion until truth became smothered
under a meaningless mass of empty form further
as those using these arts came to care only for the
results they could produce by them to advance
their own selfish ends they guarded them more and
more jealously and actively resented even to the
point of destroying any and all attempts to deviate
from their rule of thumb practises

vuillingness to serve in any capacity no
matter how humble and sacrifice anything
even themselves for the advancement of truth and
knowledge was not in them just as it is not in the
average humanity of today those who can cheer-
fully and wholesomely endure to see others sup-
plant them in undertakings to which they have
given their all and rejoice in the advancement of
the cause are few and far between and this unfortu-
nate human weakness of selfishness is materially
holding back human progress in many lines today
just as it has always done throughout the centuries
that we have not been making greater psychic
progress is due not so much to lack of ability as to
the fact that the field has not appeared to offer the
rich promises of financial gain which represent
selfish power today that many other lines have
there have been however recently a number of
epoch-making books written along psychic lines
which i believe are destined to accomplish a great

work in quickening the perceptions and concen-
trating the attention of all who read them upon the
almost undreamed of possibilities lying dormant
within us

  a last word in closing for some who will read
this the hidden pathway to the glorious south
undoubtedly stands open ponder well before you
set your untried feet upon it the ancient land-
marks are almost lost amid the sands of the ages
the dangers are imminent and terrible upon every
side only he that endureth to the end shall be
saved a single mis-step may bring instant de-
struction there are worse things than physical
death there is no promise of reward at the end
save as work well done brings ever the capacity and
the responsibility to do a yet greater work well
he that goes does so for the great love of all hu-
manity that is in him without hope of fee or reward
if after weighing all this you still desire above
anything and everything else to enter upon this
greatest of adventures if you have no earthly ties
or responsibilities to hinder you if you are sure of
yourself of the steadfastness of your purpose of
your unflinching courage to meet and conquer the
lions along the way then commit yourself into the
hands of your god and in faith and purity arise
and make your progress-henry v thornton

  omething from hermann b deutsch
of our writers brigade concerning one of
the characters in his stories a personal let-
ter but one i think hell not mind my shar-
ing with you	new orleans la

  bob sellers-the original of the bob keller
stories-was killed a month or so ago by a negro he
was just placing under arrest bob had just come
back from the conservation commissioners office
where in the presence of duly accredited witnesses
he had released three beautiful cock kentucky
cardinals which had been taken by a cajan trapper
when he noticed three negroes hiding something in
bundles of moss they were trying to get away
with poached muskrat skins bob promptly in-
formed them they were under arrest two of the
blacks submitted peacefully enough the third
plunged back into his cabin and came back out
shooting the first shot took bob through the
stomach bobs young son was with him so bob
drew his gun tried to raise it couldnt and then
turned to bob jr and said hes got me son
now you go get him the son shot it out with the
negro wounded him but not fatally and the black
escaped into the swamp

  they brought bob in to the big red hospital on
prytania street he was operated on at once and
successfully but his strength-which is under-
estimated rather than exaggerated in the bob keller
stories-was his undoing he came out of the
ether delirious seven of us could not hold him
down when he got it into his poor fevered head that
he had to go out into the swamps to get that negro

  we clamped to his arms and legs but he twisted
and squirmed so that he ruptured his riddled body
he had been wounded four times in all and died
the longest day or night i live ill not forget his
dying reproach to me you arent playing a mans
part hermann holding me down like this when i
got to get that black-that shot me

  well we organized a posse at once and i spent
the camp-fire



the next week in the swamps wafst-deep in water
for the most part with four bloodhounds and a pet
german shotgun of mine we got the negro on
the sixth day but it was a cajan ranchman jean
grenier who shot him in the back instead of one of
bobs friends having shot him from in front i was
about two minutes and thirty seconds too late to do
the shooting however if there is a consciousness
after death bobll know that his friends tried

j am sending you herewith the photographic evi-
dence of a recent and very wonderful fishing
trip to manila village one strip shows my own
classic features with those of frank o king the
chicago illustrator the aged aged man is miguel
mosquera better known now as mcgill mosquito
who trains a pair of beautiful hounds napoleon
and lourenfo by name to hunt turtles for him
when the hounds strike a terrapin-trail they follow
it baying in a maimer that would shame caruso
having found mr or mrs terrapin as the case may
be the hounds will leap at it causing the startled
turtle to pull in its neck to say nothing of feet and
tail then the nearest hound will reach down and
turn the turtle on its back and bay like a coon-dog
who has treed his quarry for miguel jules fisher
buys all the old manilaman-who is eighty years of
age-can catch for theyre a great delicacy and
one on which we feasted royally during our visit

  the little scene shows the principal part of
manila village-the store and the warehouse be-
tween which not shown in the picture is the little
screened bungalow on whose gallery you sit to watch
a butter-gold moon climb out of barataria bay and
cleave a gold and silver path across the black waters
of the gulf ah well-

  the long strip shows the shrimp dance-a part of
manila village platform where shrimp-principally
for export to japan-are sun-dried and then
threshed by being danced out to grind the glassy
brittle hulls to powder leaving only the rubbery
dried shrimp to be packed in barrels my own
elongated figure is in the foreground jules fisher
is behind me and frank king ahead of me

jncidentally i am sure there is a plot con-
cealed somewhere in this two years ago i
drove a flivver to san francisco and back being
snowed in one day at navajo right between the
painted desert and the petrified forest out of
the storm there came to us one bob thomas a
radium prospector and after he had thawed himself
out i absorbed large earfuls of his life among the
zuni indians while we smoked and were warm and
frowsty and the swollen rio puerco growled at the
foot of the clay bank whereon our cabin was perched
he told me of the ancestor-worship of the zunis
who deify turtles and frogs as their forebears and
lamented the fact that he couldnt get a real big
gotl to worship

  i mentioned this to jules fisher while we swapped
yarns in the moonlight on his screened gallery last
week and he promptly had miguel mosquera sum-
moned and ordered him to produce three of the
enormous white turtles which grow in those waters--
regular sea-wolves too beside whom a shark is a
mild shrinking and merciful kindly beast miguel
has come through in noble fashion  i am trying to
get in touch with bob thomas to notify him to let
us know where he wants his little old gods shipped-

in connection with his story in this

new canaan connecticut

  the judgment o god is a bloody tale but the
country was a bloody country in the s the lit-
tle sun-warped saloon still stands where seven
mexicans were shot and killed just before the rest
of the mexican population of the town were driven
out into the desert a mexican packer a mighty
genial and likable chap told me the story his big
brown eyes were calm and his voice was matter-of-
fact while he told me that his little nine-year-old
sister was shot and killed by a bullet fired through
the barricaded door of their little dobe house

  the town had no such excuse as i have given
logan for running amuck they were simply
filed by blood-lust mob-frenzy and above all
by that destructive and foolish thing racial hatred
and-it seems to me-particularly foolish where
mexicans are concerned for no people are quicker
to respond to kindness or reciprocate a favor

it seems strange for years before
our last war i was one of those who
tried to stir americans into preparing
against war they wouldnt stir they
said there wouldnt be any war war was a
thing of the barbarous past wed had the
last one wed ever have

  but war came a war worse than the
world had ever known

  now through these same columns i am
again one of those who try to stir ameri-
cans into preparing against war this
time with the world in ferment they cant
say war is a thing of the past they dont
even argue theyre sick of the war idea
and wont even talk about it if they think
of it at all they dismiss the danger with
well if we do have one weve proved we
can get ready and lick the other fellow
easily enough


adventure

in one way our success in the world
war was a calamity for this country
it increased the size of our swelled head
made us more cock-sure and careless than
ever about our prowess in arms

  we forget the facts

  we had a year to get ready in a nd we
needed every minute oj that year when we
finally declared war it was so far as any
immediate importance on land was con-
cerned only an empty declaration a gesture
meaning nothing we had nothing to fight
with we had no men to do the fighting
dont you remember that year of fevered
preparation and when we did get an
army to the scene of action they were still
unfit to fight until our experienced allies
had given them further training

  that war was fought  miles from our
boundaries we could sit safe at home for
a year and prepare for it

  we wouldnt have been safe even 
miles away if another nations fleet hadnt
helped protect our coasts and coast cities
from the far ranging enemy

  we feel proud of the size and speed of
our preparation of our years preparation
we forget that even a whole years time
was so inadequate that our preparation was
too hasty and inefficient and that our
boys sent over there paid the cost of that
haste and inefficiency many of them with
their lives

the next war may not be  miles
away there will be no safe year for
preparing and were not prepared now

  we have veterans now to be sure but
modem warfare since - changes and
advances more in a month than it used to
do in a year and those veterans are not
equipped

  our next war will burst against our own
coast there will be scant warning if any
as in the russo-japanese war the attack
may be made before the declaration of war

  who will attack us

  well however little we may like to think
so nearly everybody hates us also we
are rich and fat for plundering the other
nations are poor almost any of the larger
ones probably several together may take
a try at us

  germany still nurses the blood and
iron idea and is not so weak as might
appear from the manipulations of her capi-
talists or her very poverty might drive

her to it-to recoup an anglo-german
alliance is not so wildly improbable or
germany may go bolshevist and unite with
russia to scourge the world

  france only reluctantly and belatedly
did france sign the five-power naval limita-
tion treaty and refused to limit her sub-
marines or limit anything for more than
ten years the next war will be one of
chemicals and will be largely decided in the
air germany has retained chemical su-
premacy and france has attained air
supremacy-a very heavy supremacy she
is preparing primarily against germany
secondarily against england the main
point is that she is as ready for war as in
napoleons day

  england the government speaks as a
iriend the english people are more un-
friendly to us now than in  or 
there are points of friction how many
more of them will there be and how many
will be too many england as always will
follow whatever policy will get england
most in todays tangled world politics
all played on very thin ice who can say
what will happen

  russia bolshevist russia she has a
standing army trained and equipped of
more than a million men dont make the
mistake of underestimating either the
training or the equipment and russia in
spirit and intention is already at war with
all the world that is not bolshevist

  japan like us rich after the war but
not like us prepared her population
crowded for space even before has increased
one-third in the last twenty years she
must have more room the japs do not
thrive in extreme cold or extreme heat
china is her prey but china is already
densely populated where else is room
for her expansion japs on our pacific
coast in the philippines in hawaii reaching
for foothold in mexico and south america
and everywhere it is we who stand in her
way

the anglo-jap alliance is no more no
formal existence but japan for years
has policed india for england while en-
gland in return backs japan in china

  england would never fight her anglo-
saxon cousins well she did so twice
but not now i hope not maybe she
doesnt want to but you can rest assured
she will so play her cards that if she feels
the camp-fire



she has to attack us she will be in good
shape to do so

  have you noticed that canada is moving
for an arrangement under which the british
empire can not draw her into a war without
her formal consent looks like a move for
peace but perhaps england not canada
was responsible for that move certainly
such an arrangement would be ideal for
englands purposes in case she and japan
declared war on us

such a war would be a naval and air
war they could seize our outlying
possessions and harry our coasts and bomb
our cities with comparative ease and big
results while invasion of our mainland by
armies would be a more difficult and less
profitable attempt englands fleet along
with japans would be the major weapon

  now consider with canada joining in
the war against us she would add prac-
tically nothing to that fleet and because
of our far greater numbers and resources
our armies-ugly and distasteful as the
thought is-could retaliate by invasion
thereby possibly taking from the british
empire one of its most valuable parts

  a very simple way for england to avoid
that awkward happening is to arrange in
advance so that canada can not be forced
into war by the empire if england and
japan declared war on us the canadian
government would refuse to take part it
would be backed in this by the canadian
people for they and we have lived in peace
for more than a hundred years war between
us is as repugnant to them as it is to us
and also they liko the australians and
new zealanders have no warm spot in
their hearts for the yellow peril

  so there you are by this simple little
move the british empire loses nothing from
its offensive power and protects itself abso-
lutely against invasion of one of its most
valuable parts for canada would be a
neutral and sacred from any molestation
the english and jap fleets would be un-
diminished and could have things pretty
much their own way with alaska and our
island possessions the panama canal
would undoubtedly be blown up inside of
twenty-four hours after war was declared
and our navy would have to split in two each
half of it against a powerful navy or unite
in one ocean if it could-leaving the other
ocean and our other coast free to the enemy

  why else would canada bargain for
freedom from the empires wars would
she have kept out of the world war if shed
had freedom to refuse only a fool can
think so after her utter loyalty and devo-
tion has she suddenly become less loyal
and devoted there seems no evidence of
such a change then why this proposed
arrangement to give her the opportunity to
keep out of a war if she wishes or if the
empire wishes

ive dwelt on this possibility of an anglo-
jap offensive against us chiefly because
the case shows how the improbable may
after all be entirely possible certainly the
example does not trace back to any anti-
english feeling on my part some of you
have accused me of being pro-english some
of being anti-english im neither just
pro-american i have only one point to make
we may very well have to face another
war against what nation or nations i do
not know but there is small chance that
we shall again have a year for preparation
and equally small chance that the war will
again be  miles away from our coast
we are not prepared for such a war we
ought to be

  we are not a nation that seeks war i do
not think even our politicians have or will
have any desire for aggressive war and
even our politicians who foist so many dis-
liked things upon us would not dare try to
foist an aggressive war upon us for there
is none of the blood and iron doctrine in
the american people we do not like war
being peaceable folk and our attitude
traditional and actual is to let the other
fellow alone if he will let us alone

  but all the other fellows are carrying
guns are we safe without a good gun of
our own

world peace how are we going to
get it unless we lead the way by dis-
arming go down into some gangster dis-
trict and see how far you get toward general
disarmament by going without a gun your-
self the world is pretty close to being a
gangster district at present there are only
two ways to make a gangster district peace-
able one is to police it with adequate
force the other is to reform the gangsters
the reforming has to be done before it is
safe for you to disarm yourself in the
district-a s h

   question-i am interested in africa especially
that section around uganda and the kongo i am
most interested in the uncivilized parts it would

please me very much to learn more of it and so i
decided to write

  	how many types of animals are there within
these two sections

  	does the savage gorilla still inhabit the kongo

  	are the savage tribes completely subdued by
the whites


adventure

  	what are the most destructive diseases of this
region

  	is the country densely populated with tropical

forest

  ti do monkeys and apes inhabit this section

  	i intend to go to africa some day could you
suggest a possible way-kenneth lancaster
waterville me

 answer by mr beadle-in answer to your
queries

  	scores couldnt possibly pretend to state
exact number

  	yes

  	yes though there still remain small areas
where theyre apt to get fresh

  	sleeping sickness dysentery blackwater
malaria

  	some parts yes others a wilderness

  	yes

  	sorry cant suggest a way as for one thing you
dont state your position or qualifications just
want enough to get there and i guess youll do it

    the full statement of the sections in
  this department as given in this issue
  is printed only in alternate issues

    down the grand canon by boat

 also a few words with regard to placer-
    ing the san juan

 question-would you kindly give me any in-
formation you can as to how far a party could go
down the colorado river by boat from grand junc-
tion is there any game for hunting or trapping
and what is it is there any chance for prospecting
especially placer mining

 could a boat return up the river-m d
biuggs smuggler san miguel co colo

  answer by mr shaw-parties have been clear
through the grand canon in boats one outfit
made it on a raft along in the nineties another went
through in a boat more recently i would not advise
any one to try it unless expert white-water men
personally i should prefer a canoe or a bateau such
as is used by river-men in the maine and canadian
timber drives

  by the word expert i do not mean the ability to
handle a boat or canoe on lakes or smooth rivers
even in rough weather you must know how swift
water acts under all conditions how it sets against a
cliff-base against a curve or straight wall how to
take advantage of the back-set eddy behind a rock
in mid stream how far up-stream is the submerged
rock whose ripple breaks with a spray etc etc
you must know how to use a setting-pole to work
up a steep pitch or to let yourself down when the
channel is too crooked or too full of rocks to shoot
successfully

  i am an old-timer with paddle and setting-pole
but i should make an event of it should i consider
going below the dandy crossing you can make it
to the dandy crossing with very little trouble if
you are familiar with water by the time you get
there you will be in a position to judge pretty well
whether you care to proceed

  you will find game most all the way especially in
utah from the junction of green river on to where
the san juan comes in blacktail deer in season
bear mostly cinnamon bobcat and mountain lion
some wild turkey ruffed grouse low down and blue
grouse in the hills also badger rabbits and coyotes
as well as the more common fur animals

  this game you understand needs hunting ive
hunted all over the southwest and never found it
easy to get-not nearly so easy as in maine and
canada

   am not familiar with placer conditions above
where the green river comes in but if you go up the
san juan river you will find enough to keep you
going from the colorado nearly up to bluff city
these are high bench placer and you have to
pack your water to the ground or carry the dirt to
the river however you can make days wages by
hand methods if some one can invent a scheme to
wash that dirt in quantity it could be made to pay
big

  there are fairly high cliffs at the points where the
best of this placer ground is and you will need a
fifty-foot coil of half-inch rope that rope will come
in handy several times i predict before you reach
the san juan

  however you will have a whale of a good time
if you go and youll find enough game and fish for
the pot it would be a tough proposition either to
row or paddle back up-stream

  you can get down to the lower san juan quite
easily by pack-horse from where you are take the
rio grande southern to dolores and outfit there
one pack-animal will do if there are two of you
strike for disappointment creek via cortez and
leave the lone cone to the northerly hitting south-
west-by-west perhaps through norwood and from
there to bluff city it is fine hunting and fishing
all the way and a dandy ride

  whichever way you go be sure and dont cross the
utah line into arizona when east of the grand
river for then you will be inside the navajo reser-
vation and uncle sam doesnt stand for hunting or
prospecting on the ground set aside for his wards
it seems too bad too for theres a lot of excellent
prospects gold both quartz and placer as well as
turquoise down in that section

  good luck to you whatever you do now that
weve got in touch write again if you want more
data that im able to give

estates for  apiece

  i hats what theyve been selling at in
austria-some of them and with the
accent on the been

  question-when i get out of cuba which i
hope to do before long i want to go to live some-
where where a little american money will go a long
way and i get interested when you talk of buying
an estate for  in england where i was bom
the owner of an estate expects the property to
give him a living from rents of tenants sale of timber
or other products of the land

  would you mind telling me if the estates now
selling so cheap in austria germany etc can give
a living to their owners or are they estates that give
no income or have their incomes been all eaten up
by taxes
ask adventure

  how much does it cost now approximately in
american money per month for a family to live in
austria-i mean a family of the ordinary office-
worker class that would live in the states on an in-
come of say  a month

  do not publish my name or address

  answer by mr fleischer-while it is quite true
that about  american currency will buy an es-
tate in austria these estates are not on par
with the english estates you mention in your
letter

  there have been sold during  and up to last
year a number of holdings formerly belonging to
members of the austrian nobility and the prices re-
ported to me by my informant ranged from  to
 from my own experience i know that such
estates located in the valley of the danube in
salzburg and styria consisted of the castle-
more or less modern more often rather ancient-
buildings some timberland and what we term here
the-farm there are of course the usual out-houses
and stables

  there were a few cattle farm horses pigs and
fowls several parcels of land planted with rye bar-
ley and oats few of wheat in the danube valley
were parcels of land where grapes and hops were
grown i hardly think that even in pre-war days
a single one of these possessions supported the
owner these were men of means judged accord-
ing to the standard of these days they had a
manager on their property lived there a few weeks
in the summer or if they also owned a game pre-
serve spent the fall there hunting

  since writing the information which appeared in
an earlier number of adventure i have been told
that there are hardly any bargains left people
from countries with sound exchange have bought up
all there were to be had however there are
some attractive pieces of land large farms to be
had in or near the larger villages and small
towns

  in such a place a family depending on the income
you mention can live in comfort and save money
there may not be the conveniences which we take
as a matter of course over here but life is pleasant
nevertheless

  the only towns i could suggest would be linz in
upper austria and graz in styria vienna is ex-
pensive due to the fact that so many foreigners stop
there and prices are in accordance the palmy
days when a dollar went far in vienna seem to be
over

  before you do anything i would suggest that you
get in touch with either the american or british
consul in vienna and get first-hand information
from them they are on the spot and report actual
economic conditions to their respective govern-
ments i also receive reports but by the time they
reach me conditions may have changed consider-
ably things move very fast over there although
you may have noticed that for about a year the
austrian crown has maintained a fairly steady level

  i hope that i am giving you the information you
request but should you have a more definite subject
in view write me again

  if you dont want an answer enough

it you dont want it

muskrat-farming

almost the only fur-bearer holding its
    own on the census-sheets today

  question- would it be a good location for a
muskrat farm in the vicinity of the city of parry
sound

  	what kinds of game and fur are found in the
northern part of the district of parry sound

  	are there any muskrat farms anywhere around
georgian bay where

  	where in ontario could a person catch an
original stock such as dark or black rats

  	what time do rats mate and have their young
along georgian bay how many litters

  	there seems to be quite a little land open for
settlement in parry sound is it a good farming
district-ray wm bakek san francisco calif

  answer by mr catton- i know of no good
location that is available for a muskrat farm in the
vicinity of parry sound there may be a good
location there and i not know of it i havent
covered all the ground in that vicinity but when
i take into consideration the requirements of such
a farm i am inclined to think you could do better
elsewhere-farther away from such a large body ox
water as georgian bay you see a large body of
water like georgian bay is too much of a temptation
to the rats and once they get into big water they
are usually gone

  a rat farm needs to be successful a fairly large
marsh a good distance from large bodies of water
or big streams the district of muskoka inland
and miles from the larger bodies of water would
be o k if you locate on a big marsh or swamp

  	game and fur in the northern part of the dis-
trict of parry sound deer moose a few bears
wolves foxes beavers otters a few raccoons musk-
rats skunks rabbits partridge ducks etc also
a few fisher and marten have been taken there

  	cant say whether there are any rat farms
around georgian bay but it is quite likely there
are some inland from the big water write the
department of game and fisheries parliament
building toronto ontario for this information
and for all information needed on fur-farming in
ontario

  	an original stock for a rat farm may be cap-
tured anywhere where the rats live and that is

 most anywhere in ontario north of toronto the
north american musquash its right name
ranges from the rio grande river to the arctic
circle and despite the advance of civilization holds
its own pretty well-as does the red fox in fact
the musquash has been killed in the heart of the
toronto streets-a city of a half-million people
then too some of the sporting magazines such as
rod and gun in canada published here in wood-
stock sometimes carry ads of fur stocks for sale

  but you are mistaken in thinking that there is a
black species of this animal there isnt there
is only one species of this rodent in america the
dark or black being only darker phases of the
brown there is in russia a muskrat desman
myogale that is black above and white underneath
but it is small and of little value as a fur-bearer

  	rats from my observation mate all through
the summer i have never made a study of them
adventure

nor read much of their habits but from sundry and
haphazard observations i would judge that they
mate and bear a litter of young at least twice in
the summer season i have caught rats in october
in muskoka that were heavy with young and once
dug a family out of a creek-bank in may that con-
sisted of a female and three kittens and i have
seen lots of half-grown rats in july and august
your data from the department of game and
fisheries should include this information

  	for muskrat-farming on the land that is open
for settlement in parry sound my answer to ques-
tion one will apply but if you mean by farming
raising crops of grain or vegetables the answer is
no the season is too short spring frosts are too
late and fall frosts too early

  come again if you think there is anything else
you want to know that i can tell you

 ask adventure service costs you
nothing whatever but reply postage and

and as far as they go i believe they are correct

  	both live-stock and poultry breeding to any
accountable extent are in a state of infancy in

scientific methods and maintains a number of
experiment depots there are private live-stock
gilds and district cattle-shows are held but i know
of no national associations as yet

lost trails



  answer by mr liebe- in south florida you
should find deer some bear and panther turkey
fox squirrel and gray squirrel duck flicker quail etc

  	for hunting the bigger game mentioned above
i like any good high-power rifle-winchester or
remington automatic preferably perhaps--
caliber with soft-nose bullets and i especially
recommend sights of the lyman variety for hunt-
ing the smaller game i prefer a -gage repeating
shotgun with either -inch or -inch barrel the
latter-named length a modified choke and the former
a full choke

  	hunting and fishing laws are subject to changes
each year i believe get in touch with the florida
state game and fish warden or commission in
tallahassee find out also about the cost of licenses
and state whether you are a resident or a non-
resident of the state

  	answer above

  	tackle for fishing in okeechobee any good
rod and reel black silk lines of about -lbs test
either oshaughnessy or sproat hooks running
from a size that will take a nickel in the curvature
on down to minnow-hooks for catching bait min-
nows the best sport in my opinion however is
in casting with wooden minnows using heddons
zaragosa south bend bassoreno and the surprise
minnow the surprise is a dandy take different
colors if you cast but stick to the lighter colors-
white or yellow or a mixture of white and yellow
with some red about the head

  	the best time to go to the okeechobee section
is in december

  	tanning hides is not in my line

   the best method of hunting alligators go at
night with a bright light shine their eyes and
shoot them mark the spot and go back next day
to grapple for them with a big hook on a long pole

  	camping-equipment tent folding army-
type beds mosquito-nets cooking-utensils water-
containers emergency medicines and especially for
possible but hardly probable snakebite get a
doctors advice here small ax rope flashlight with

extra batteries etc let your good judgment guide
you and travel as light as possible dont forget
water-proof container for matches dont forget
iodin for insect bites or oil of citronella to keep
insects off you can take from this list whatever
equipment you will need on the side trips

  have a distinctly understood signal shot in case
any of you become lost you may possibly need
a guide and if you do take one

  as for any other information-use your wits
and youll come out all right i think

  the canoe you mention is a nice size but dont take
any chance with it in a high wind on okeechobee

  the canadian lumberjacks activities

jgy any other name he works as hard

  question-will you please tell me some of the
duties of a lumberjack and the pay and whether
he is supposed to work as helper first name and
describe the different positions-stanley began-
sky munhall pa

  answer by mr moore-lumberjack which
is the american term for what we know over here
as shantyman covers a vast number of occupations
allied to the lumber industry a road-cutter is a
man who cuts roads a loader is a man who helps
load the logs on to the sloops a log-cutter fells the
trees either by ax or saw or with both afterward
trimming off the branches and cutting the trees
into lengths or logs a skidder puts the logs on skids
by the aid of horses and leaves them there until
the roads are cut in when the logs are taken out
to the dump the men on the dump unload the logs
as they arrive and roll them up so that they can
be let into the water for the spring when they are
taken out on what they call the drive then there
are the teamsters in some big camps the stable-
bosses etc etc

  now then as to wages--say twenty dollars per
month and board for the chore-boy up to about
forty-five dollars and board for good men
