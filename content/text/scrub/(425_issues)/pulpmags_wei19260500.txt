city i		
gulping swiftly swallowing my ter-
rible fear i flung the door wide open
and ran out of the cabin toward that
eery cry in the darkness

a heartless brakeman dis-
covered me and kicked me off
the train at palisades i
didnt care greatly as well be
dropped here in moses coulee like a
bag of spoiled meal as farther up the
line when a man knows he has but
a short time to live what matters it
had i not been endowed with a large
modicum of my beloved fathers stub-
bornness i believe i should long ere
this have crawled away into some
hole like a mongrel cur to die there
was no chance to cheat the grim
reaper that had been settled long
ago when without a gas mask i had
gone through a certain little town in
flanders

  my lungs were just about done
dont think i am making a bid for
sympathy i know a sick man seldom
arouses in the breast of strangers any
other emotion than disgust

but i am telling this to explain my
actions in those things which came
later-to alibi myself of the charge
of cowardice

after leaving the train at palisades
i looked up and down the coulee
where to go i hadnt the slightest
idea wenatchee lay far behind me
at the edge of the mighty columbia
river i had found this thriving lit-
tle city unsympathetic and not par-
ticularly hospitable i couldnt there-
fore retrace my steps besides i
never have liked to go back over lost
ground i saw the train which had
dropped me crawl like a snake up the
steep incline which led out of the
coulee i hadnt the strength to fol-
low i knew that i could never make
the climb

  so wearily i trudged out to the
road and headed farther into the cou-
lee to come some hours later to an-
other cul-de-sac it was another to
me impossible incline this time a
wagon road i have since learned that
this road leads via a series of three
huge terraces bridged by steep in-
clines out of moses coulee it is
called the three devils-dont ask
me why for it was named by the
siwash indians

                                     


weird tales

  at the foot of this road and some
half-mile from where it began to
climb i saw a small farmhouse from
the chimney of which a spiral of blue
smoke arose lazily into the air here
were folks country folks upon whose
hospitality i had long ago learned to
rely grimy with the dust of the trail
damp with perspiration red spots
dancing in the air before my eyes be-
cause of the unaccustomed exertion
to which i had compelled myself i
turned aside and presently knocked
at the door of the farmhouse

  a kindly housewife answered my
knock and bade me enter i was
shortly told to seat myself at the ta-
ble to partake of the tasty viands
brought forth by this taciturn woman
of the coulee when i had finished
eating i arose from my place and was
about to ask her what i might do in
payment for the meal when i was
seized with a fit of coughing which
left me faint and trembling and i
had barely composed myself when the
womans husband and a half-grown
boy entered the house silently and
looked at me

  how come a man as sick as you
is out on the road afoot like this
demanded the man

  i studied the three carefully be-
fore replying nothing squeamish
about them knew something of the
rough spots of life all of them i
knew this at once so i told them my
story and that i had neither friends
nor family nor abode while i
talked they exchanged glances with
one another and when i had finished
the husband looked at me steadily for
a long moment

  is there a chance for you to get
well he asked finally

  i am afraid not i tried to make
my voice sound cheerful

  would you like to find a place
where nobodyd bother you  a place
where you could loaf along about as
you wished until your time came

  i didnt exactly like the way he put
it but that was just about all there
was left for me and to date even
that had been denied me

  i nodded in answer to the question
the man strode to the door and
pointed

  see there he asked thats
the road you came here on against
that two hundred-foot cliff opposite
that cliff back of my house is another
cliff thirteen hundred feet high
matter of fact my place is almost
surrounded by cliffs dont need to
build fences except where the coulee
opens away toward columbia river
which is some lot of miles away from
here cliffs both sides of it all the
way down no other exit except
there

  as he spoke he swung his extended

forearm straight toward the cliff to
the north

  see what looks like a great black
shadow against the face of the cliff
right where she turns to form the
curve of the coulee

  yes i see it

    well that aint a shadow thats
the entrance to another and smaller
coulee which opens into this one it
is called steamboat coulee and if
you look sharp you can see why

  i studied that black shadow as he
pointed carefully running my eyes
over the face of the cliff then i
exclaimed suddenly so unexpectedly
did i discover the reason for the name
given the coulee right at the base
of that black shadow was a great pile
of stone its color all but blending
with the mother cliff unless one looked
closely and this mass of solid rock
from where we stood in the doorway
of the farmhouse looked like a great
steamboat slowly emerging from the
cleft in the giant walls

  good lord i exclaimed if i
didnt know better i would swear that
was a boat under steam

  its fooled lots of folks re-
turned the fanner dryly well that
the ghosts of steamboat coulee



coulee entrance is on my land so i
guess i have a right to make this
proposition to you back inside that
coulee about two miles is a log cabin
that could easy be made livable just
the place for you and i could send
in what little food you would need
its kind of cool at night but in the
daytime the sun makes the coulee as
hot as an oven and you could loaf
all day in the heat there are plenty
of big rocks there to flop on and-
who knows-maybe youd even get
well

  and nobody owns the house i
inquired

  yes i own it i used to live in
it myself

  why did you move i felt as a
fellow must feel when he looks a gift
horse in the face but to save me i
could not forbear asking the question

  the man hesitated for a good min-
ute before answering

  well he said finally all my
land lies out here in moses coulee
and when i lived in there i could not
keep my eye on it i have large melon
patches down toward steamboat and
if there isnt someone here when the
siwashes drift through to their pot-
latch on badger mountain outside
the damn indians would steal all the
melons so we moved out here 

the explanation sounded reason-
able enough but it left me un-
satisfied i had been moodily gazing
at that black shadow on the cliff
which was the entrance to steamboat
coulee and while i stared it had come
to me that the huge maw looked oddly
like a great open mouth that might
take one in and leave no trace there
was something menacing about it dis-
tant though it was i felt that this
unexplainable aura would become
more depressing as one approached
the coulee i had begun to distrust
these people too the woman and
the son talked too little even for peo-
ple who lived much alone

  the sun was westering deepening
the shadow at the mouth of steam-
boat at the two irregular edges of
the shadow there hung a weirdly
shimmering blue haze

  i blamed morbid fancies to my sick-
ness i began to reason with myself
here was i a grown man looking a
gift horse in the mouth questioning
the motives of kindly people who were
but giving me a chance to die under
cover like a human being-near to
if not among friends

  i swallowed my forebodings and
turned to the man beyond him over
his shoulder i looked into the eyes
of the woman who arms akimbo was
standing in the half-shadow beyond
the door gravely awaiting my an-
swer confound it why couldnt
she say something beside her stood
the boy also noting me gravely as
my eyes went to the boy his tongue
crept forth from his mouth slowly
and described a circle moistening his
lips my morbid fancy saw something
sinister even in this for i was minded
of a cat that looks expectantly at a
saucer of cream i jerked my head
around to meet the eyes of the man
and he too was regarding me
gravely

  i thank you sir i said as po-
litely as i could you are very kind
i accept your offer with great pleas-
ure may i know to whom i am in-
debted for this unusually benevolent
service   

  again that queer hesitation before
the answer when it came the tones
were strangely harsh almost a rebuke

 what difference does a name
make we dont go much on last
names here that there is reuben
my boy and this is my wife hildreth
my own name is plone you can tell
us what to call you if you wish but
it dont make much difference if you
dont care to

 my name is harold skidmore
late of the u s army once more
allow me to thank you then i shall go


weird tales

into my new home before it gets so
dark i cant find it

  thats all right reuben will go
along and show you the place hillie
put up a sack of grub for skidmore
enough to last him a couple of days
hell probably be too sore from his
walk to come out for more before that
-and we may be too busy to take any
in to him

  the woman dropped her arms to
her side and moved into the kitchen
to do the bidding of plone plone
what an odd name for a man i
studied him as apparently having
forgotten me he stared moodily down
the haze-filled coulee i tried to see
what his eyes were seeking but all i
could tell was that he watched the
road by which i had come to this
place-watched it carefully and in
silence as though he expected other
visitors to come around the bend
which leads to the three devils he
did not turn back to me again and
when ten minutes or so later reuben
touched my arm and started off in the
direction of steamboat plone was
still staring down the road

  i looked back after we had left the
house well behind and he was watch-
ing me now while his taciturn wife
stood motionless beside him with her
arms akimbo looking at the two
made me feel strangely uncomfort-
able again so i turned back and tried
to engage reuben in conversation as
soon as i spoke he quickened his
stride so that it took all of my breath
to keep pace with him

  but i had a chance to study the
territory over which we traveled
back in my mind i remembered
plones remark about his melon
patches and looked about for sight of
them we were half way to the
steamboat coulee entrance yet i
hadnt seen a melon patch or any-
thing that remotely resembled one
though i knew absolutely nothing
about farming i would have sworn
that this ground hadnt been culti-

vated for many years it had been
plowed once upon a time but the
plowing had been almost obliterated
by scattered growths of green sage-
brush which had pushed through and
begun to thrive while in the open we
struggled through regular matted
growths of wild hollyhocks heavy
with their fiery blooms plones
farm was nothing but a desert on the
coulee floor

  but we were approaching steam-
boat coulee entrance and the nearer
we strode the less i liked the bargain
i had made for the entrance looked
more like a huge mouth than ever
but those red spots were dancing be-
fore my eyes again and may have
helped me to imagine things

  when we reached the entrance its
mouthlike appearance was not so pro-
nounced and the rock which had
looked like a steamboat did not re-
semble a steamboat at all the floor
of this coulee was a dry stream-bed
which when the spring freshets came
must have been a roaring torrent

before entering the coulee behind
reuben i looked back at the
house of plone and shouted in amaze-
ment

  reuben where is the house i
can see all of that end of the coulee
and your house is not in sight

  we come over a rise a high one
thats all he replied carelessly if
we go back a piece we can see the
house only we aint got time i
want to show you the cabin and get
back before dark this coulee aint
nice to get caught in after dark

  it isnt i questioned why
not

  but reuben had begun the entrance
to steamboat coulee and did not an-
swer i was very hesitant about fol-
lowing him now for i knew that he
had lied to me we hadnt come over
any rise and i should have been able
to see that farmhouse what had
happened to my eyes were they
the ghosts of steamboat coulee



like my lungs failing me  i stopped
dead-still there in the bottom of that
dry stream-bed reuben stopped
ahead of me and looked silently back
he smiled at me insolently a sort of
challenging smile just stood there
smiling what else could i do i
strode on after reuben

  i liked this coulee less and less as
we went deeper into it walls rose
straight on either hand and they
were so close that they seemed to be
pressing over upon me the stream-
bed narrowed and deepened on its
banks grew thickets of wild willow
interspersed with clumps of squaw-
berry bushes laden with pink fruit
behind these thickets arose the talus
slope of shell-rock

  i studied the slopes for signs of
pathways which might lead out of
this coulee in case a heavy rain should
fill the stream-bed and cut off my re-
treat by the usual way but saw none
i saw instead something that filled
me with a sudden feeling of dread
causing a sharp constriction of my
throat it was just a mottled mass on
a large rock but as i looked at it the
mass moved untwisted itself and a
huge snake glided out of sight in the
rocks

  reuben i called are there
many snakes in this coulee   

  thousands he replied without
looking back rattlers blue racers
and bull whips-but mostly rattlers
keep your shanty closed at night and
stay in the stream-bed in the daytime
and they wont be any danger to
you

  well i was terribly tired else i
would have turned around and quit-
ted this coulee-yes though i fell
dead from exhaustion ten minutes
later as it was i followed reuben
who turned aside finally and climbed
out of the dry stream i followed him
and stood upon a trail which led
down a gloomy aisle into a thicket of
willows heavy shadows hung in this
woody aisle but through these i could

make out the outline of a squatty log
cabin

  ten minutes later i had a fire go-
ing in the cracked stove which the
house boasted and its light was driv-
ing away the shadows in the comers
there was one chair in the house and
a rough bed against the wall the
board floor was well laid-no cracks
through which venturesome rattlers
might smell me out i made sure of
this before i would let reuben get
away and that the door could be
closed and bolted

  well said reuben who had
stood by while i put the place rap-
idly to rights youll be all right
now snug as a bug in a rug-if you
aint afraid of ghosts

  his hand had dropped to the door-
knob as he began to talk and when
he had uttered this last sinister sen-
tence he opened the door and slipped
out before i could stop him those
last six words had sent a chill through
my whole body in a frenzy of fear
which i could not explain i rushed
to the door and looked out intending
to call reuben back

  i swear he hadnt had time to reach
that stream-bed and drop into it out
of sight but when i looked out he
was nowhere to be seen and when i
shouted his name until the echoes rang
to right and left through the coulee
there was no answer he must have
fairly flown out of that thicket

  i	closed the door and barred it
placed the chair-back under the door-
knob and sat down upon the edge of
the bed gazing into the fire

  what sort of place had i wandered
into

  for a time the rustling of wind
through the willows outside the log
cabin was my only answer then a
gritty grating sound beneath the
floor slow and intermittent told me
that a huge snake sluggish with the
coolncss of the evening was crawling
there and was at that moment scrap-


weird tales

ing alongside one of the timbers
which supported the floor

  i was safe from these thank god

  the feeling of security which now
descended upon me together with the
cheery roaring of the fire in the stove
almost lulled me to sleep as i sat
my eyes were closing wearily and my
head was sinking upon my breast  

  a cry that the wildest imagination
would never have expected to hear in
this place came suddenly from some-
where in the darkness outside

  it was a cry as of a little baby that
awakes in the night and begs plain-
tively to be fed and it came from
somewhere out there in the shell-rock
of the talus slopes



merciful heaven how did it
happen that a wee small child
such as i guessed this to be had wan-
dered out into the darkness of the
coulee whence had it come were
there other inhabitants in steamboat
but plone had told me that there
were not then how explain that
eery cry outside  a possible explan-
ation inspired by frayed nerves came
to me and froze the marrow in my
bones before i could reason myself
out of it

  if you aint afraid of ghosts

  what had reuben of the unknown
surname meant by this remark and
by what means had he so swiftly dis-
appeared after he had quitted my new
home

  just as i asked myself the question
that wailing cry came again from
about the same place as near as i
could judge on the talus slope in rear
of my cabin unmistakably the cry
of a lost baby demanding by every
means of expression in its power the
attention of its mother out there
alone and frightened in the darkness
in the heart of steamboat coulee
which reuben had told me was in-
fested by great numbers of snakes at

least one kind of which was venomous
enough to slay

 dread tugged at my throat my
tongue became dry in my mouth
cleaving to the palate i knew before
i opened the door that the coulee was
now as dark as erebus and that mov-
ing about would be like groping in
some gigantic pocket but there was
a feeble child out there on the talus
slope lost in the darkness wailing
for its mother and i prided myself
upon being at least the semblance of
a man

  mentally girding myself i strode
to the door and flung it open a mi-
asmatic mist came in immediately
cold as the breath from a sunless
marsh chilling me anew instinctive-
ly i closed the door as though to shut-
out some loathsome presence-i knew
not what the heat of the fire ab-
sorbed the wisps of vapor that had
entered i leaned against the door
panting with a nameless terror when
from the talus slope outside plain
through the darkness came again that
eery wailing

  gulping swiftly swallowing my
terrible fear i closed my eyes and
flung the door wide open nor did
i close it until i stood outside and
opened my eyes against an opaque
blanket of darkness when plone
had told me the coulee was cold after
nightfall he had not exaggerated it
was as cold as the inside of a tomb

  the crying of the babe came again
from directly behind my cabin the
cliff bulked large there while above
its rim high up i made out the soft
twinkling of a pale star or two

  before my courage should fail me
and send me back into the cheery
cabin thrice cheery now that i was
outside it i ran swiftly around the
cabin nor stopped until i had begun
to clamber up the talus slope guided
by my memory of whence that wailing
cry had come the shell-rock shifted
beneath me and i could hear the shale
go clattering down among the brush
the ghosts op steamboat coulee	

about the bases of the willows below
i kept on climbing

  once i almost fell when i stepped
upon something round which writhed
beneath my foot causing me to jump
straight into the air with a half-sup-
pressed cry of fear i was glad now
that the coulee was cold after night-
fall else the snake were it by chance
a rattler could have struck me a
death-blow the cold however made
the vile creature sluggish

xhen i thought i had climbed far

v	 enough i bent over and tried to
pierce the heavy gloom searching the
talus intently for a glimpse of white
-white which should discover to me
the clothing of the baby which i
sought failing in this i remained
quiet waiting for the cry to come
again i waited amid a silence that
could almost be felt a silence lasting
so long that i began to dread a repeti-
tion of that cry what if there were
no baby-flesh and blood that is
reuben had spoken of ghosts utter
nonsense no grown man believes
in ghosts and if i didnt find the
child before long the little tot might
die of the cold where had the child
gone why this eery silence why
didnt the child cry again it was
almost as though it had found that
which it sought there in the darkness
that cry had spoken eloquently of a
desire for sustenance

  if the child did not cry what was
i to believe who or what was
suckling the baby out on the cold
talus slope

  i became as a man turned to stone
when the eery cry came again it
was not a babys whimper starting
low and increasing in volume it was
a full-grown wail as it issued from the
unseen mouth and it came from at
least a hundred feet higher up on the
talus i a grown man had stumbled
heavily in the scramble to reach this
height yet a baby so small that it
wailed for its milk had crept a hun-

dred feet farther up the slope it
was beyond all reason weird beyond
the wildest imagination but un-
doubtedly the wailing of a babe

  i did not believe in ghosts i stud-
ied the spot whence the wail issued
but could see no blotch of white only
two lambent dots set close together
glowing like resting fireflies among
the shale i saw them for but a sec-
ond only undoubtedly mating fire-
flies and they had flown

  i began to climb once more mov-
ing steadily toward the spot where i
had heard the cry

  i stopped again when the shell-rock
above me began to flow downward as
though something or somebody had
started it moving what in gods
name was up there at the base of the
cliff slowly my heart in my mouth
i climbed on

  there was a rush as of an unseen
body along the face of the talus i
could hear the contact of light feet on
the shale but the points of contact
were unbelievably far apart no baby
in the world could have stepped so
far-or jumped of course the cry
might have come from a half-witted
grown person but i did not believe it

  the cry again sharp and clear but
at least two hundred yards up the
coulee from where i stood and on
about a level with me should i fol-
low or not did some nocturnal ani-
mal carry the babe in its teeth it
might be i had heard of such things
and had read the myth of romulus
and remus distorted fantasies per-
haps but show me a man who can
think coolly while standing on the
talus slopes of steamboat after dark
and i will show you a man without
nerves-and without a soul

  once more i took up the chase i
had almost reached the spot whence
the cry had come last when i saw
again those twin balls of lambent
flame they seemed to blink at me-
off and on off and on


weird tales

  i bent over to pick up a bit of shale
to hurl at the dots when almost in
my ears that cry came once more
but this time the cry ended in a spit-
ting snarl as of a tom-cat when pos-
session of food is disputed

  with all my might i hurled the bit
of shale i had lifted straight at those
dots of flame at the same time i
gave utterance to a yell that set the
echoes rolling the length and breadth
of the coulee the echoes had not
died away when the coulee was filled
until it rang with that eery wailing-
as though a hundred babies cried for
mothers who did not come

 then-great god-i knew

  bobcats the coulee was alive with
them i was alone on the talus two
hundred yards from the safe haven of
my cabin and though i knew that
one alone would not attack a man in
the open i had never heard whether
they hunted in groups for all i
knew they might at imminent risk
of breaking my neck i hurled myself
down the slope and into the thicket of
willows at the base through these
and into the dry stream-bed i blun-
dered still running i kept this mad
pace until i had reached the approxi-
mate point where the trail led to my
cabin climbed the bank of the dry
stream and sought for the aisle
through the willows

  though i searched carefully for a
hundred yards on each hand i could
not find the path and i feared to
enter the willow thicket and beat
about the ominous wailing had
stopped suddenly as though at a sig-
nal and i believed that the bobcats
had taken to the trees at the foot of
the talus i studied the dark shadows
for dots of flame in pairs but could
see none i knew from reading about
them that bobcats have been known
to drop on solitary travelers from the
limbs of trees their sudden silence
was weighted with ponderous menace

  i was afraid-afraid scared as i
had never been in my life before-

and i had gone through a certain
town in flanders without a gas mask

  why the sudden eery silence i
would have welcomed that vast chorus
of wailing had it begun again but
it did not

  when i crept back to the bank of
the stream-bed a pale moon had come
up partly dispelling the shadows in
steamboat coulee the sand in the
stream-bed glistened frostily in the
moonlight making me think of the
blinking eyes of a multitude of toads

  where in steamboat was the cabin
with its cheery fire i had closed the
door to keep my courage from failing
me and now there was no light to
guide me

  it is hell to be alone in such a place
miles from the nearest other human
being

isat down on the high bank half
sidewise so that i could watch the
shadows among the willows and tried
mentally to retrace my steps hoping
that i could reason out the exact loca-
tion of the cabin in the thicket

  sitting as i was i could see for a
hundred yards or so down the stream-
bed i studied its almost straight
course for a moment or two for no
reason that i can assign i saw a
black shadow dart across the open
space swift as a breath of wind and
disappear in the thicket on the oppo-
site side it was larger than a eat
smaller than the average dog a bob-
cat had changed his base hurriedly
and in silence

  silence that was the thing that
was now weighing upon me more
even than thought of my failure to
locate the little cabin why had the
cats stopped their wailing so sudden-
ly as though they waited for some-
thing this thought deepened the
feeling of dread that was upon me
if the cats were waiting for what
were they waiting

  then i breathed a sigh of relief
for coming around a bend in the
the ghosts of steamboat coulee



stream-bed there strode swiftly to-
ward me the figure of a man he was
a big man who looked straight before
him he walked as a country man
walks when he hurries home to a late
supper then there were other peo-
ple in this coulee after all plone
like reuben had lied

  but what puzzled me about this
newcomer was his style of dress he
was garbed after the manner of the
first pioneers who had come into this
country from the east from his
high-topped boots into which his
trousers were tucked loosely to his
broad-brimmed hat he was dressed
after the manner of those people who
had vanished from this country more
than a decade before my time an
old prospector evidently who had
clung to the habiliments of his
younger days but he did not walk
like an old man rather he strode
straight-limbed and erect like a man
in his early thirties there was a
homely touch about him though pic-
turesque as he was for he smoked a
corn-cob pipe from the bowl of which
a spiral of blue smoke eddied forth
into the chill night air i knew from
this that did i call to him his
greeting in return would be bluffly
friendly

  i waited for him to come closer
hoping that he would notice me first
as he approached i noticed with a
start that two huge revolvers the
holsters tied back swung low upon
his hips people nowadays did not
carry firearms openly in an instant
i had decided to let this stranger pass
even though i spent the remainder of
the night on the bank of the dry
stream sight of those savage weap-
ons had filled me with a new and dif-
ferent kind of dread

  then i started as another figure
also of a man came around the self-
same bend of the watercourse for
there was something oddly familiar
about that other figure he moved
swiftly his body almost bent double

as he hurried forward as he came
around the bend and saw the first
man who had come into my range of
vision he bent lower still

  as he did so the moonlight glowed
dully on something that he carried in
the crook of his arm i knew instant-
ly that what he carried was a rifle
once more that chill along my spine
for there was no mistaking his atti-
tude

  he was stalking the first man fur-
tively and there was murder in his
heart

  it did not take his next action to
prove this to me i knew it even as
the second man knelt swiftly in the
sand of the watercourse and flung the
rifle to his shoulder its muzzle point-
ing at the man approaching me

 as the kneeling man aimed the
deadly weapon his head was drawn
baek and the moonlight shone for a
moment on his face i cried out loud-
ly and in terrible fear as much to
warn the unconscious man as in sur-
prize at my discovery for the man
with the rifle was my moses coulee
benefactor-plone

  again i cried out this time with
all the power of my shattered lungs
and the man ahead all unconscious
of the impending death at his heels
paid me absolutely no attention he
was no more than twenty yards from
me when i shouted yet he did not
turn his head for all the attention
he paid me i might as well have re-
mained silent it was as though he
were stone-deaf

  as this thought came to me the first
man raised his head and looked di-
rectly into my eyes and through and
beyond me as though i had not been
there i saw his eyes plainly and in
them was no sign that he noted my
presence

  i shouted again waving my arms
wildly perhaps he could not see me
because of the shadows at my back
still he did not see me i whirled to
the kneeling man just as a sheet of


weird tales

yellow flame leaped from the muzzle
of his rifle the first man was right
in front of me when the bullet struck
him he stopped dead in his tracks
i guessed that the bullet had struck
him at the base of the skull even
so he whirled swiftly and both his
guns were out but he could not
raise them to fire he slumped for-
ward limply and sprawled in the
sand

  i had not heard the report of the
rifle for simultaneously with that
spurt of flame the bobcats had begun
their wailing once more drowning out
the sound

  i unable to prevent it or give a
warning had seen a cold-blooded
murder enacted there before me in
the sand was the proof of it i half
arose intending to run to the fallen
man to see if he still lived but when
i saw plone arise leisurely from his
knees and come forward i drew back
in the shadow again plone was a
killer and i had seen him make his
kill if he knew that his evil deed
had been witnessed he would have no
compunction about another killing
and even to me whose life was des-
tined to be short life was still sweet

  i drew back and waited

  plone stopped above the fallen man
and looked down then he opened
the breech of his rifle and coolly blew
the smoke from the bore he kicked
the fallen man with the toe of his
boot and i saw his lips move as
though he whispered something he
took the two pistols shrugged his
shoulders and turned away walking
swiftly back the way he had come
carrying his rifle in the crook of his
arm the murdered men he left to
the creatures of the night

  well the man was dead no doubt
about that but the sand was deep
and i could bury him i watched
until plone reached the turn in the
watercourse where he seemed to van-
ish as though the earth had opened
and swallowed him

  then i dropped into the stream-bed
and strode to the fallen man stooped
over him to see that he no longer
breathed-and drew back with a cry
of horror for what looked up at me
was not the face of a man newly
slain but the sightless eyes of a grin-
ning aged skull

as i stared in unbelief the per-
spiration starting from every
pore the skull seemed to fade slowly
away before my eyes and in a matter
of seconds there was nothing before
me but the shifting sand upon which
there was not even a depression where
a body had fallen

  add to this uncanny happening the
myriad-tongued caterwauling of the
bobcats on the talus-crying as of
babies lost in the night - and yon
can faintly guess at the state of my
nerves but i could not believe my
eyes something was wrong said rea-
son so i stooped again and ran my
hand hurriedly over the sand where i
had seen the body surely i could
not have been mistaken

  frantically unable to believe it all
hallucination i ran my fingers deep
into the sand at once they brought
up against something solid which for
many minutes i found myself with-
out the courage to uncover i con-
quered this fear finally and began to
dig

  soon there lay before me in a shal-
low grave a fleshless skeleton this
in itself did not bother me for i have
seen many such and in flanders
fields i have slept peacefully with
dead buddies all around me but
while digging near the skull of my
find i had unearthed something else
which had been fairly well preserved
in the dry sand

  it was a rotting corn-cob pipe with
black corroded bowl

  with a great cry whose echoes
could be heard in the coulee even
through the wailing of the bobcats i
sprang to my feet and ran stagger-
the ghosts of stejboat coulee	

ing down the watercourse in the di-
rection i had come before darkness
with reuben

  long before i had reached it my
poor body failed me and i fell to the
sandy floor coughing my lungs away
while scarlet stains wetted the sand
near my mouth

  then blackness descended



txhen i awoke in the sand the sun

	 was shining some sixth sense
told me to remain motionless warning
me that all was not well without
moving my head i rolled my eyes un-
til i could see ahead in the direction
i had fallen in falling my right
hand had been flung out full length
fingers extended

  imagine my fear and horror when
i saw coiled up within six inches of
my hand a huge rattlesnake his
head was poised above the coil while
just behind it against the other are
of the vicious circle the tip of the
creatures tail adorned with an inch
or more of rattles hummed its fear-
ful warning

  with all my power i sprang back
and upward at the same time the
bullet head unbelievably swift
flashed toward my hand and-thank
god-safely beneath it stretched
helplessly now to its full length the
creatures mouth with its forked
tongue had stopped within a scant
two inches of where my face had been

  before the rattler could return and
coil again i had stepped upon the bul-
let head grinding it deep into the
sand and when the tail whipped
frantically against my leg i seized it
and hurled the reptile with all my
might out of the stream-bed into the
shell-rock even as i did it i won-
dered where i had found the courage
and what had kept me from moving
while unconscious had i moved i
might never again have awakened

  the sun was directly overhead i
had lost my sense of direction during

last nights rambles among the shale
and could not figure out which way i
should go to win free of this coulee
then i remembered the direction
plone had taken and set out to trace
his footsteps but there were none i
could not understand it for i had
seen plone quite plainly in the moon-
light

  i passed around the bend where he
had disappeared and continued on
when ten minutes later i came to
the shallow grave with its aged skele-
ton which had so taken away my
nerve last night i did not know where
i was i had been sure that this grave
was in the opposite direction but
plone must have known the way out-
i knew that he lived on the floor of
moses coulee into which steamboat
debouched

  i kept on moving if as i now
believed i had been in error in the
location of the grave then my log
cabin lay ahead of me i climbed the
bank of the dry stream and continued
my hike thereon keeping well away
from the thickets for fear of snakes
with the sun high in the heavens
turning the coulee into a furnace the
snakes came out by hundreds to bask
upon the shale and as i passed they
coiled and warned me away with
myriad warnings i did not trespass
upon their holdings

  after i had plodded along for fully
an hour i knew that i must be quite
close to the rock which gives steam-
boat its name but still i had not
found the pathway leading to the log
cabin evidently i had already
passed it

  even as i had this thought i came
upon a path leading into the shadows
of the willow thicket-a path that
seemed familiar even though from
the stream-bed i could not see the
cabin with a sigh and much sur-
prized that i had last night tiav-
eled so far i turned into this path
and increased my pace


weird tales

  i came shortly to pause chilled
even though the sun was shining for
at the end of the mossy trail there
was no cabin but a cleared plot of
ground adorned with aged mounds
and rough-hewn crosses rocks were
scattered profusely over the mounds
and i guessed had been placed to
foil the creatures which otherwise
would have despoiled the bodies rest-
ing there there was a great over-
hang of the cliff wall bulging out
over the little graveyard and from
the overhang came a steady drip of
moisture slimy water lay motionless
in a pool in the center of the plot
mossy green were the stones mud-
puppies scurried into the deeps as i
stopped and stared turning the water
to a pool of slime

  how uneasy i felt in this place
why had such a remote location been
chosen as a cemetery hidden away
here from the brightness of gods
sunshine nothing but shadow-filled
silence except for the dripping of the
water from the overhang

  i hurried back to the stream-bed
and continued on my way

another hour passed during
which my body racked with con-
tinual coughing i suffered the tor-
ments of the damned those red dots
were dancing before my eyes again
and nothing looked natural to me
the sunning snakes in the shale
seemed to waver grotesquely-twist-
ing writhing coiling here on the
cliff was a row of ponderous pali-
sades but they seemed to be ever
buckling and bending as though
shaken by an earthquake

  then far ahead i saw the rock at
the entrance with a sob of joy i
began to run-only to stop when i
reached the pile with a cry of hope-
lessness and despair for the rock
unscalable even to one who possessed
the strength to climb now filled the
coulee from lip to lip while on my
side of the pile there nestled a little

lake clear and pellucid into which i
could look straight down for what
i guessed must have been all of twen-
ty feet

  some great shifting of the walls
during the night had blocked the en-
trance entombing me in steamboat
coulee with all its nameless horrors

  there was no one to see me so i
flung myself down at the edge of the
pool and wept weakly bemoaning my
terrible fate

  after a time i regained control of
my frayed nerves arose to my knees
and bathed my throbbing temples
sometime somehow i reasoned plone
would find a way to reach me there
was nothing to do now but return and
search again for my cabin plone had
hinted that he would be in after a
day or two with supplies for me if i
did not come out for them-and i felt
that he would know how to get in by
some other way he had lived in the
coulee and should know his way
about

  wearily i began the return march
it never occurred to me to note that
the sun went ahead of me on its jour-
ney into the west i can only blame
my physical condition for not noting
this had i done so i would have real-
ized at once that i had gone in the
wrong direction in the first place and
that straight ahead of me lay freedom
i had gone to the head of the coulee
straight in from steamboat rock and
when i had found the coulee blocked
at the end had thought the entrance
closed against me

  but i did not note the sun

 strode wearily on and found the
cabin with ridiculous ease

  inside calmly awaiting my coming
sat hildreth the wife of plone she
said nothing when i opened the door
just sat on the only chair in the house
and looked at me i spoke to her
thanking her for the sack of provi-
sions which i saw on the rickety shelf
on the wall beyond the door still she
the ghosts of steamboat coulee



said nothing just stared at me un-
blinking

  i asked her about leaving this place
and she shook her head as though she
did not catch my meaning

  for gods sake hildreth i
cried cant you speak

  for it had come to me that i had
never heard her speak when i had
first entered the farmhouse she had
placed a meal for me and had bidden
me eat of it but i remembered now
that she had done so by gestures with
her hands

  in answer now to my question she
opened her mouth and pointed into it
with her forefinger hildreth the
wife of plone had no tongue

  did you ever hear a tongueless per-
son try to speak  it is terrible for
after this all-meaning gesture there
came a raucous croak from the mouth
of hildreth-wordless gurgling alto-
gether meaningless

  i understood no word but the eyes
of the woman strangely glowing now
were eloquent she was trying to
warn me of something and stamped
her foot impatiently when i did not
understand i saw her foot move as
she stamped it-but failed to notice
at the time that the contact of her
foot with the board floor made no
noise later i remembered it

  when i shook my head she arose
from her chair and strode to the door
flinging it wide then she pointed up
the coulee in the direction i had just
come again that raucous croak still
meaningless once more i shook my
head

  what was there up that coulee
that menaced me 

  i was filled with dread of the un-
known wished with all my soul that
i could understand what this woman
was trying to say to me what was
there up the coulee about which she
strove to tell me

  all i could think of was a hidden
graveyard dotted with rotting crosses
and in the center of the plot a pool

in which slimy mud-puppies played
hidden forever from the light of the
sun

  i shivered as the picture came back
to me

  then i stepped back to search
about the place for paper so that
with the aid of a pencil which i pos-
sessed she might write what she had
to tell me i found it and turned
back to the woman who had watched
me gravely while i searched noting
the paper she shook her head telling
me mutely that she could not write

  then plone his face as dark as a
thundercloud stood in the doorway
to me he paid no attention his
eyes glowering below heavy brows
burned as he stared at the woman in
her eyes i could read fright unutter-
able she gave one frightened croak
and turned to flee but she could
not go far for she fled toward the
bare wall opposite the open door
plone leaped after her while i
jumped forward to fling him aside ere
he could lay hands upon the woman

  imagine my horror when hildreth
touched the wall - and vanished
through it as though there had been
no wall i caught a glimpse of the
wall not a breach in it before plone
too plunged through and was gone

  to me now came an inkling of what
it all meant now i understood or
thought i did the mystery of the dis-
appearing farmhouse was this land
into which i had stumbled a land of
wraiths and shadows  a land of rest-
less dead people why

  trembling in every fiber of my be-
ing i strode to the wall where plone
and his wife had gone through and
ran my hand over the rough walls
they were as solid almost as the day
the cabin had been built to me this
was a great relief i should not have
been surprized had the walls also
proved to be things of shadow-sub-
stance letting me through to stand
amazed upon the shell-rock behind the
cabin


weird tales

  here was one place in the coulee of
shadows that was real

  i went to the door locked and
barred it then i returned and
lighted the stove to disperse the un-
natural chill that hovered in the room
after this i searched out my food
and wolfed some of it ravenously an-
other thought came to me if reuben
plone and hildreth were nothing but
shadows where had i procured this
food which was real enough and well
cooked somewhere in my adven-
tures since being kicked off the train
at palisades there was a great gap
bridged only by fantasies and hallu-
cinations what had happened real-
ly in that blank space 

  having eaten i stepped to the door
and looked out if i again went forth
into the strcam-bed in an attempt to
get out of the coulee i should never
reach it before dark what would it
mean to my tired reason to be caught
in the open in the midst of this cou-
lee for another terrible night i
could not do it

  again i secured the door nothing
real could get in to bother me-and
even now i reasoned myself out of
positive belief in ghosts the hallu-
cinations which had so terrified me
had undoubtedly been born of my
sickness

  convinced of this at last i lay down
on the rough cot and went to sleep

xhen i awoke suddenly in the
  night the fire had burned very
low and a heavy chill possessed the
cabin i had a feeling that i was not
the only occupant of my abode but
striving to pierce the gloom in the
cabins comers i could see nothing

  but stay what was that

  in the farthest comer i saw the
pale ghostly lineaments of a woman
just the face shimmering there in the
gloom oddly but neither body nor
substance the face of hildreth wife
of plone then her hands no arms
visible came up before her face and

began to gesture her mouth opened
and i imagined i again heard that
raucous croak of the tongueless again
her eyes were eloquent mutely giving
a warning which i could not under-
stand

  fear seizing me in its terrible grip
i leaped from my bed and threw wood
on the fire hoping to dispel this silent
shadow when the light flared up the
head shimmered swiftly and began
to fade away but not before i saw a
pair of hands come forth from no-
where and fasten themselves below
that head about where the neck
should have been hands that were
gnarled and calloused from toil on an
unproductive farm - the work-torn
hands of the killer plone

  then the weird picture vanished
and i was alone with my fantasies

  i had scarcely returned to my seat
on the bed sitting well back against
the wall so that my back was against
something solid when the wailing of
lost babies broke out again on the
talus slopes outside i had expected
this to happen after nightfall but the
reality left me weak and shivering
even though i knew that the animals
that uttered the mournful wails were
flesh and blood the wailing of
bobcats no matter how often it is
heard always brings a chill that is
hard to reason away nature certain-
ly prepared weird natural protec-
tions for some of her creatures

  then the wailing stopped suddenly
-short off and the silence was more
nerve-devastating than the eery wail-
ing

  nothing for many minutes then
the rattle of sliding talus as the shale
glided into the underbrush

  this stopped and a terrible silence
pressed down upon me

  then my cabin shook with the force
of the wind that suddenly swooped
through the coulee it rattled through
the eaves shook the door on its hinges
while the patter-patter on the roof
told me of showers of sand which the
the ghosts op steamboat coulee



wind had scooped up from the bed of
the dry stream the wind was ter-
rific i thought but ever it increased
in power and violence

  the patter on the roof and the rat-
tle in the eaves began to take on a
new significance for the patter
sounded like the scamper of baby feet
above my head while the wailing
about the eaves sounded like the
screaming of people who are tongue-
less the door bellied inward against
the chair-back as though many hands
were pressed against it from outside
seeking entrance yet i knew that
there was no one outside

  then faint and feeble through the
roaring of the wind i caught that
eery cry in the night it was the de-
spairing voice of a woman and she
was calling aloud hopelessly for
help i shivered and tried not to
hear but the cry came again nearer
now as though the woman moved to-
ward me on leaden feet

  in gods name what woman could
be abroad in such a night

  the cry again no man fear the
shadows as he might could ignore
that pitiful plea and call himself a
man again

  i gritted my teeth and ran to the
door flinging it open a veritable
sea of flying sand swept past me but
through the increased roar came
plainly that cry for help i left the
door open this time so that the light
would stream out and guide mv re-
turn

  on the bank of the dry stream i
stopped

  i heard the slamming of a door be-
hind me i turned back the door
opened a bit and a face looked out-
the leering now malevolent face of
reuben the son of plone as i saw
him he jerked back closing the door
again shutting out the light

  even as the wailing of the bobcats
had stopped so now stopped the
wind and before and below me i
saw hildreth wife of plone fighting

for her very life with her brutal hus-
band  she was gxoveling on her
knees at his feet-his hands were
about her throat as she begged for
mercy i could understand her words
she had a tongue after all then
plone holding hildreth with his left
hand raised his right and crooking
it like a fearful talon poised it above
the face of hildreth

  he did a ghastly unbelievable
thing i can not tell it but when
his hand came away her words were
meaningless gurgling - the raucous
croaking of a person who has no
tongue

  forgetting what i had before ex-
perienced frenzied with horror at
what plone had done i leaped into
the dry stream and ran forward-to
bring up short in the middle of the
sandy open space staring aghast

  for i was all alone-no hildreth
the tongueless-no plone with the cal-
loused hands once more a hallu-
cination had betrayed me

  screaming in fear i sprang out of
the stream-bed and rushed to the
cabin crashing against the door in
my frenzy with all my weight

  the door did not open rather it
bellied inward slightly as though
someone held against my efforts in-
side

  who or what was inside

  too late now i guessed what the
wraith of hildreth had tried to tell
me going back in my memory i
watched her lips move again and
as they moved i read the words she
would have uttered as plain as
though she had spoken i now under-
stood the warning

  as you value the reason god has
given you-do not leave this cabin to-
night

  i understood now as panting with
my exertions i pressed my weight
against the door that would not give
-except slightly

  for from inside the log cabin faint
as the sighing of a spring zephyr


weird tales

came the faintest sound as of someone
breathing



what was coming to me out of the
night that against which the
wraith of hildreth had tried to warn

me

  my eyes must have been very wide
had there been anyone to see my body
chilled with fear - afraid to force
in the door and see what it was inside
that breathed expectantly-afraid to
face about and keep my eyes upon
the stream-bed where i had seen hil-
dreth battle for her life against her
spouse

  choosing between the two fears as
a desperate person chooses between
two evils i turned with my back
against the jamb of the door and
stared toward the dry stream

  at once there came to me the odor
of burning tobacco someone was
near me someone who smoked but
who it was there was no way for me
to learn the door behind me shook
slightly so i darted to the comer of
the cabin where i could see both the
dry stream and the door

  expectant silence for many min-
utes during which i would have wel-
comed the eery wailing of the bobcats
on the shell-rock

  then the door of my cabin opened
and out walked a stranger he was
dressed very much as had been the
man whom i had seen fall before the
murderous rifle of plone last night
but he was older stooped slightly un-
der the weight of years i heard him
sigh softly as a man sighs whose
stomach is comfortably filled with
food

  he walked toward the stream-bed
following the path through the
thicket

  he had almost reached the lip of
the dry stream when another figure
followed him from the cabin-and
that figure was reuben the malevo-
lent son of plone reuben as his

father had stalked that other unfor-
tunate stalked the aged man who pre-
ceded him more pungent now the
odor of burning tobacco though the
stooped stranger was not smoking
the latter passed a clump of service
berry bushes and paused on the lip
of the dry stream he had scarcely
halted when out of the clump of serv-
ice berries stepped plone himself
moving stealthily like a cat that stalks
a helpless unsuspecting bird

  the older man half turned as
though he heard some slight sound
when plone with the silent fury of
the bobcat making a kill leaped bod-
ily upon his back and bore him to
the ground where the two of them
fighting and clawing rolled into the
sand below

  plone was smoking an evil-smelling
pipe

  reuben began to run when his
father closed with the stranger and
i was right at his heels when he
leaped over the edge to stop beside
the silent combatants then he bent
to assist his father

  the end was speedy for what
chance has an aged man taken by
surprize against two determined kill-
ers  they slew him there in the sand
while i my limbs inert because of my
fright looked on horror holding me
mute when i would have screamed
aloud

  their bloody purpose accomplished
reuben and plone methodically be-
gan to turn the pockets of the dead
man inside out the contents of these
they divided between themselves
this finished in silence the murder-
ers taking each an arm of the dead
man began to drag the body up the
sandy stretch toward the end of the
coulee-the closed end

  still i stood as one transfixed

  then i became conscious of a low
heart-breaking sobbing at my side
turning i saw the figure of hildreth
standing there tragedy easily read-
able in her eyes wringing her hands
the ghosts of steamboat coulee	

as her eyes followed the figures of
her husband and her son then she
extended her hands in a pleading ges-
ture calling to the two who dragged
the body

  then she began to follow them
along the stream-bed dodging from
thicket to thicket on the bank as
though she screened her movements
from plone and reuben i watched
her until her wraithlike form blended
with the shadows in the thickets and
disappeared from view

  as i watched her go and saw the
figures of plone and reuben passing
around a sharp bend in the dry
stream there came back to my mem-
ory a mental picture of a graveyard
located in perpetual shadow adorned
with rotting crosses upon which no
names were written slimy stones at
the edge of a muddy pool populated
by serpentine mud-puppies

  turning then i hurried back to the
cabin whose door now stood open-
to pause aghast at the threshold star-
ing into the interior

a t a table in the center of the room
-a table loaded with things to
eat fresh and steaming from the
stove - sat another stranger this
time a man dressed after the manner
of city folk his clothing bespoke
wealth and refinement while his man-
ner of eating told that he was accus-
tomed to choicer food than that of
which necessity now compelled him
to partake daintily he picked over
the viands sorting judiciously while
near the stove stood hildreth her
eyes wide with fright and wordless
entreaty

  reuben stood in a darkened comer
and his eyes never left the figure of
the stranger at the table as he
stared at this one i saw his tongue
come forth from his mouth and de-
scribe a circle moistening his lips an-
ticipatory like a cat that watches a
saucer of cream

  plone too was silently watching
standing just inside the door with
his back toward me as i watched
him he moved slightly edging toward
the table

  then plone was upon the stranger
a carving knife snatched from the
table in his hand

  but why continue  i had seen this
same scene slightly varied but a few
minutes before in the sand of the dry
stream

  i watched them rifle the clothes of
the dead man stepped aside as they
dragged the body forth and away up
the coulee for where is the hand
that can halt thfe passing of shadows 

  for hours i watched there beside
the cabin while reuben and plone
carried forward their ghastly work
many times during those hours did i
see them make their kill ever it was
plone who commanded ever it was
reuben who stood at his fathers side
to assist ever it was hildreth who
raised her hand or her voice in pro-
test

  then suddenly she was back in
the cabin with reuben and plone
she told the latter something gestur-
ing vehemently as she spoke these
gestures were simple easy to under-
stand for she pointed back down
the coulee in the direction of steam-
boat rock somehow i knew that
what she tried to tell him was that
she had gone forth and told the au-
thorities what he and reuben had
done plones face became black with
wrath reubens turned to the pasty
gray of fear which is unbounded
both sprang to the door and stared
down the coulee then plone leaped
back to hildreth striking her in the
face with his fist she fell to the
floor groveling on her knees at his
feet he dragged her forth into the
trail along it to the dry stream-bed

  there while i watehed was repeat-
ed that terrible scene i had witnessed
once before the pleading of hil-
dreth the motion before her face of


weird tales

plones hand crooked like a great
talon then her gurgling scream
which told that her mouth was empty
of the tongue

reuben advanced to the lip of the
dry stream as plone fought with
reubens mother he paid them no
heed however but shaded his eyes
with his hand as he gazed into the
west in the direction of steamboat
rock then he gestured excitedly to
plone pointing down the coulee

  but plone was all activity at once
with reuben at his heels and hil-
dreth stumbling farther in the rear
they rushed to the cabin and began to
throw rough packs together one each
for reuben and plone

  but in the midst of their activities
they paused and stared at the door-
way where i stood then slowly
though no one stood there except my-
self they raised their hands above
their heads while hildreth crouched
in a corner wild-eyed whimpering

  plone and reuben suddenly lurched
toward me haltingly as though pro-
pelled by invisible hands their
hands were at their sides now as
though bound there securely by ropes
outside they came walking oddly
with their hands still at their sides

  they stopped beneath a tree which
had one bare limb high up from the
ground-a strong limb white as a
ghost in the moonlight reuben and
plone looked upward at this limb and
both their faces were gray hildreth
came out and stood near by also look-
ing up wringing her hands grief
marring her face that might once
have been beautiful

  reuben and plone looked at each
other and nodded then they looked
mutely at hildreth as though asking
her forgiveness after this they
turned and nodded toward no one
that i could see as though they ges-
tured to unseen hangmen

  i cried aloud even though i had
foreseen what was to come as both

plone and reuben sprang straight
into the air to an unbelievable height
to pause midway to that bare limb
their necks twisted at odd angles
their bodies writhing grotesquely

  i watched until the writhing
stopped until the bodies merely
swayed as though played upon by
vagrant breezes sweeping in from the
sandy dry stream

  then for the last time i heard the
piercing wordless shriek of a tongue-
less woman i swerved to look for
hildreth and saw a misty wraithlike
shadow disappear among the willows
flashing swiftly out of sight up the
coulee

  hildreth had gone and i was alone
swaying weakly nauseated staring
crazily up to two bodies which oscil-
lated to and fro as though played
upon by vagrant breezes

  then the bodies faded slowly away
as my knees began to buckle under
me i sank to the ground before the
cabin and darkness descended once
more

when i regained consciousness
i opened my eyes expecting to
see those swaying bodies in the air
above me there were no bodies
then i noted that my wrists were
close together held in place by man-
acles of shining steel

  from the cabin behind me came the
sound of voices-voices of men who
talked as they ate-noisily behind
the cabin i could hear the impatient
stamping of horses

  i lay there dully trying to under-
stand it all

  then two men came out of the
cabin toward me one of them chewed
busily upon a bit of wood in lieu of a
toothpick upon the mottled vest of
this one glistened a star emblem of
the sheriff the second man i knew
to be his deputy

  hes awake i see al said the
first man as he looked at me

it was all over in a moment that
sinister patch of purple light had
gone directly over the head and
shoulders of the spider there was
not a cry not even a murmur the
spider was gone

chapter 

the flying devil of
blennerhof

it was a lane of dead grass per-
haps ten feet wide-a straight
even strip of sere yellow extend-
ing for nearly half a mile across the
green hillside up near the crest of
the slope it terminated as abruptly
and as evenly as it had begun down
in the valley had it not been a lone-
some spot in an obscure austrian
countryside one might have believed
that some huge carpet had lain out
there in the sun until the grass be-
neath it had perished

  half-way down the slope a dead
cow lay athwart the yellow lane and
around the carcass a group of four
men were gathered only one of
them he who talked and gesticulated
so excitedly was dressed in the na-
tive costume of the countryside the
other three a rather motley trio of
physiques and faces might have
passed for tourists and yet this was
a territory remote from the beaten
paths of travel in other ways-in
cut of clothes in speech in faces half
concealed by low-pulled cloth caps
they did not seem to fit in with the
general scene either as interested

strangers or cursory wayfarers one

                                   


weird tales

of them a tall wiry individual whose
cap visor did not wholly conceal a
wide sear across his forehead spoke
impatiently indicating the muttering
peasant  what is he saying lefty 

  when lefty spoke it was in the
curiously clipped phrases of an amer-
ican who had lived for many years in
lower new york he says that a
devil done this a flyin devil that
goes over the country at night he
says hes seen him onee or twice and
now he finds his cow here dead

  the third man a short thick-set in-
dividual stirred uneasily and began
digging nervously with the toe of his
shoe in the turf near the edge of the
yellow lane his efforts sending up a
small cloud of dry dust the scarred
man who was obviously the leader of
the other two snorted derisively
nonsense its just heart-disease
thats all cows are subject to it the
same as human beings there isnt a
mark or a wound on her that i can
find his speech was clipped terse
nothing of manhattan here

 its funny mr ferris-the
mister coming from lefty was
curiously deferential to the younger
man-that she should happen to fall
right here in this dead grass aint it
i dont suppose the grass died of
heart-disease too did it

  looky here said the third man
who had been digging in the turf
heres something else thats had
heart-trouble  he stooped and
pulled out of the turf an object which
appeared to be a rough ball of gray-
ish lint looking into the ball the
others saw that it was a nest of field
mice they were all quite dead

  just the same im glad i wasnt
hangin around these parts last night
aint you lefty said the short man
to the digger

  you said it spider returned
the other

  ferris stirred impatiently   come
on lets get out of this he snapped
we didnt come up here to fiddle

around with dead cows weve been
here a week and nothing done were
going to spend another night watch-
ing the castle and tomorrow well get
busy making our plans to get at that
villa if we hang around here much
longer people will begin to ask ques-
tions

  his comment was made well out of
earshot of the peasant as they walked
slowly up the hill they did not
speak again until they reached the
crest when lefty looking back mut-
tered in an undertone ah the same
i dont like this plaee ill be glad
when weve pulled this job and get
out theres something queer about
this air it aint healthy

  the short man said nothing but
glanced nervously behind him as he
followed the others over the brow of
the hill

chapter 

castle blennerhof

the smoky purplish gloom of an
autumn twilight had settled over
the blennersee the faint breath of
an autumnal breeze left a parting
ripple on the dull surface of the
lake and rustled its way onward
through the first frost-nipped leaves
of the season-leaves deep blood-red
and somber black with none of the
brilliant yellows and golden browns
with which nature is wont to brighten
the last hours of a dying summer

  in a thick copse of scrubby moun-
tain pine growing on a small promon-
tory overlooking the lake the three
men had halted and now they stood
looking over the darkening surface
of the water their gaze absorbed not
in the purple and saffron glories of
the sunset on the heights above the
water but rather in the age-black-
ened turrets of the great castle which
reared itself on a ledgelike island
near the farther shore

  the last rays of the sun on the sum-
mits above them flickered and died
the devil ray



simultaneously from a point three
miles down the lake there came a
sudden warming glow

  thats the villa said the spider
pointing with stubby forefinger to-
ward the light i bet theyre gettin
ready to sit down to chow right now
bet that wummun is wearin bout
half a ton of dem jools ready for the
pickins

  lefty stirred uneasily but said
nothing ferris either did not hear
the remark or chose to ignore it he
had taken from his pocket a pair of
binoculars which he directed toward
the turrets rearing into the gloom of
the fast-gathering night

  i think i see those lights in the
castle again he said suddenly
you try the glass spider and tell
me what you see my eyes may be
deceiving me

  the spider had barely brought the
glasses to a focus when he started and
shrank back into the thicket the
lights again he muttered i see
them there in the middle tower win-
dow

  all right said ferris stand
watch there for a time while we get
something to eat keep your eye on
that opening in the wall under the
drawbridge and call me if you see
anything

  with the other man he went back
into the thicket where they built a
small fire they were not cold but
the village inn where they had been
staying was far down in one of the
valleys and they felt the lack of its
cheery fireside perhaps an hour or
two passed in desultory conversation
when a voice from the edge of the
lake called them baek to the promon-
tory

  its that plane again mr fer-
ris said the spider theyre
bringin her out again tonight
without seeming reason his voice had
grown strangely hoarse he shud-
dered slightly and his hand trembled
as he held out the binoculars

  all right said ferris when he
had taken a look they wont try
any flying probably until after mid-
night same as before we can stay
here and wateh them until then

  by this time lefty was standing
beside them its that plane again
said the spider pointing a shaky
forefinger toward the castle

  lefty shivered it might have been
the wind which seemed to be grow-
ing rapidly chill with the advancing
evening

  gets cold here early he said
half apologetically

  there was  snort from ferris
youre both getting scared he
snapped impatiently both getting
frightened over this fool story from
a half-baked peasant youre both in
a blue funk and ready to quit when
weve come half-way around the
world to get this stuff and weve noth-
ing but a few old men and a girl be-
tween us and nearly half a million
i cant pull this job unless i get a
little co-operation from you spineless
creatures why damn it men both
of you have police records in new
york-youve both been in gun fights
and tight places and here you are all
scared pie-eyed because you see a lit-
tle dead grass and a dead cow evil
spirits-flying devils  

  the pair opposite him stirred un-
easily it was the spider who finally
broke the silence evil spirits it
was or evil spirits it wasnt i dunno
as it makes any difference anyways
we seen the cow and you cant get
away from that it was that plane
that flew over that field and those
guys there in that castle got some-
thing which aint healthy for you nor
me to deal with

  in his own mind ferris had to ad-
mit that there appeared to be some-
thing in what the spider had said
it was two nights ago when they had
been lying in the copse watching the
castle he had discovered a faint gleam
from one of its towers soon after-


weird tales

ward he had seen an airplane glide
out from under the drawbridge and
spin silently away into the night-
silently because the usual roar of the
exhaust had been muffled in some un-
canny way

  thereafter the castle had become
an absorption with him their mis-
sion in this remote part of europe
was not an honest one and the prize
which they were seeking might lie
either in the castle which they until
now had supposed uninhabited or in
the villa up the lake yet it was the
castle which fascinated him and it
was this fascination that was reflected
in his less hardy companions they
admitted it to themselves by cold
stark fear

  it may be that ferris feared he was
losing his grip on them or perhaps it
was his overweening curiosity that
got the better of him at any rate he
suddenly began to peel off his coat
and then bent over and began to un-
lace his shoes the others eyed him
in dumb wonderment

  what you goin to do now mr
ferris ventured the spider

  swim to thei castle said ferris
shortly

  there was a tense silence

  what for

  ferris said nothing for several sec-
onds and then finally just to show
you panicky old women what a lot of
fools youve been

  the silence became somewhat pain-
ful to the two in the shadow of the
thicket there was no sound save the
sharp click of ferriss shoelaces as he
whipped them through the eyelets

  the spiders voice finally broke the
silence there aint nobody ever
goin to say that spider lang ever
was scared of any man alive or
dead he muttered he too began
removing his clothing

  ten minutes later shivering with
the chill of night they slid down into
the water with their shirts trousers

their automatics and ferriss flash-
light strapped to their shoulders
fortunately the water proved to be
warmer than the air and they struck
out slowly their white bodies scarcely
perceptible in the murky waters of
the blennersee

as ferris swam with easy strokes
he pondered on the significance
of the dead cow in the open field and
the airplane in the supposedly de-
serted castle had the two any con-
nection was the airplane from the
castle the flying devil the peasant
had told of seeing over his fields
spraying death to plants and animals
alike  if not why was there all this
secrecy with the plane at the castle
why this midnight flying why the
guarded glimmer from these suppos-
edly deserted towers

  the whole question had a strange
fascination for ferris a fascination
for which even he was at a loss to ac-
count he already had formed a
theory a theory which startled and
perplexed him because its details
came to him with such startling clear-
ness he was a strange combination
intelligent apparently highly educat-
ed bearing all the earmarks of at
least an outward culture and yet
there was a sinister twist in his na-
ture which during the past four years
had made him one of the cleverest op-
eratives in the history of american
crime

  four years before he had awakened
one february morning in a chicago
hospital with a gash across his fore-
head and a split in his skull they
had to tell him what had happened
he had been standing in a chicago
hotel two nights before when a pick-
pocket sliding deft fingers into his
pocket had removed his wallet fer-
ris became aware of the theft almost
as soon as it was consummated and
started after the thief in hot pursuit
the latter however had laid out his
course for just such an emergency
the devil-ray



for he slipped through a side door
this door in keeping with the cor-
ridor wall wherein it was set bore a
heavy glass mirror and the thief
swung the door viciously back catch-
ing perris across the forehead and
knocking him unconscious escape
after that was easy

  despite the fact that his papers
were gone with the wallet a cardcase
in the victims pocket established his
identity as george ferris this was
fortunate because on his awakening
two days later ferris had lost all
memory of who he was or where he
had come from this in itself was
no extraordinary thing but the case
did present one novel aspect to the
surgeons ferris had been convalesc-
ing rapidly regaining everything ex-
cept memory and the case was con-
sidered for the most part normal
when one day they brought him a
mirror in order that he might shave
himself scarcely had he glanced
into the thing however when he sud-
denly hurled it from him with a
scream of agony that startled the
whole ward never after that could
they induce him to glance into any
mirror the surgeons discussing the
matter concluded that a pathological
fear of his image had developed in
some quirk of his brain color was
lent to this theory when it was re-
membered that the moment before
ferris had been hurled into his ab-
normal state by the impact of the
swinging door he must have seen his
own image in the mirror before him
and that his mind had connected this
image in the nerve cells of his brain
with the pain and shock of the impact

  there was a second strange angle
to the case of which the surgeons
were quite unaware when ferris
was discharged from the hospital he
found tightly rolled up at the bottom
of his cardcase where it had appar-
ently escaped notice an envelope with
canceled postage addressed to cap-
tain lindley fenshaw of berkeley

california on its back were some
meaningless penciled figures ordi-
narily ferris would have concluded
he had picked the thing up somewhere
to make use of as a memorandum at
that time however the name of fen-
shaw was being blazoned from one
end of the country to the other for
frank fenshaw x-ray expert and
electrical scientist at the university
of california had disappeared from
his home nine months before under
circumstances which indicated a well-

many discoveries and improvements
with the x-ray in connection with
electro-therapeutics but had also

lethal nature hence the govern-

to find the man but a search of
months had failed to reveal a single
clue to his whereabouts eventu-
ally the search virtually abandoned
by the authorities had been taken up
by lindley fenshaw american flying
ace in the world war and formerly
captain of the football and fencing
teams at the university of california
where his father had occupied the
chair of electrical science the
younger fenshaw it was reported
had set out incognito alone and un-

some trace of the missing man just
why a few months later george
ferris should have found in his pos-
session an old envelope addressed to
lindley fenshaw was as much a mys-

to the authorities themselves

  that ferris did not turn the clue
over to the police but kept it to him-
self would be best understood in
light of the fact that ferris when he
discovered the letter had no desire
to meet the police for any reason
whatsoever soon after he left the
hospital quite penniless he discov-

ered in himself an easy propensity
for helping himself to other peoples
chattels in time he drifted to new
york where he hit upon a very profit-
able though somewhat precarious ca-
reer it was soon discovered that he
had a pair of marvelously sensitive
fingers and a very delicate ear all of
which could be put to lucrative use
in twirling a steel dial and listening
to the gentle click of tumblers sup-
posedly muffled behind many thick-
nesses of soft felt and chrome steel
mostly he had worked alone but of
late he had been hired by less
gifted personages for jobs which
contained something out of the or-
dinary it was in this connection
that lefty fritz and spider lang
had prevailed upon him to go to
austria

  it was the old story of the haps-
burg crown jewels the bulk of them
had disappeared when the old haps-
burg monarchy had been overthrown
and it was rumored that some of the
old die-hard nobility had been en-
trusted with their care until such
time as they might be more profitably
employed in putting the hapless
charles or his heir back upon the
throne lefty who long years ago
had been a viennese gambler had
learned through underworld channels
that they had been entrusted to old
baron von blennerhof the baron
according to the best subterranean in-
formation available had carted them
up to his country estates far away
from the clutching hands of the new
regime this rumor was colored a
bit by the fact that the baron had
some time before purchased a sizable
stivers-leemy wall safe a somewhat
rare article to be brought into that
part of the country one or two at-
tempts had been made by the vien-
nese underworld gentry to test the
barons hospitality but as the inevi-
table outcome seemed to be broken
heads and no jewels the project was
finally abandoned now it was that

the american trio had determined to
try its hand so far they had done
but little merely observing the castle
and the villa from a distance and try-
ing so far as possible to learn the hab-
its of the inmates thus they had
concluded that aside from the dozen
or so servants and guards about the
place the principals were only three
-the old baron himself a fiercely be-
mustached junker by the name of von
schaang and a young woman who ap-
peared to be the barons ward it
was only the insistence of ferris in
demanding an exhaustive survey of
the estate which resulted in their dis-
covering that the castle was some-
thing more than the moss-grown pile
of stones it had seemed to be

 as ferris swam he pondered
whether the jewels might not be at
the castle rather than at the villa
he had planned skirting the rock on
which the castle stood thereby ap-
proaching it from the side opposite
where the airplane was now visible
its black wings a dark blot against
the gloomy background of the farther
shore he had purposed lying there
in the water listening to the crews
conversation but he was barely half-
way across the lake when he began to
hear their voices and the clang of an
iron wrench a moment later while
he trod water there came a splutter-
ing roar from the darkness imme-
diately it settled down to a barely
perceptible hum presently the plane
glided out from her berth under the
drawbridge and like some huge bird
of ill omen mounted gradually into
the night and disappeared into the
east scarcely a sound save that
deep-throated muffled hum of her
engines

  with the plane out of the way fer-
ris shifted his course and struck out
for the drawbridge a few minutes
later they found themselves in a small
chamber beneath the structure at
one end was a tiny dock and by grop-
the devil-ray

g

ing about they found an iron ladder
leading upward into the castle

  it had been a long swim hampered
as they were with the loads on their
shoulders and for a time they clung
to the slippery edge of the rock be-
fore venturing into the chill air as
they rested there ferriss hand grop-
ing about for a better purchase on
the masonry came into contact with
a row of smooth cylindrical objects
each about two feet long by further
groping he knew that they must be
carefully wired to the rocks one by
one he traced their smooth steel bel-
lies down until he came to the conclu-
sion there must be at least a dozen
there within reach of his hand

  after they had drawn themselves
out of the water and put on their
clothing he took his flashlight and sent
its narrow beam down into the water
it was a small quick flash and it did
not penetrate far but it showed him
enough to make him whistle softly be-
tween his teeth

  the drawbridge and perhaps the
whole castle had been carefully
mined with cylindrical bombs pains-
takingly wired to the ledges around
its base

chapter 

the face at the barred
window

they followed the iron ladder and
crawled up through a narrow
passageway into what ferris believed
to be the ancient courtyard of the
castle here in the stygian gloom
they waited breathlessly hoping and
yet dreading to hear some sound that
would indicate to them the where-
abouts of those they knew would be
their enemies high above them
towered the great battlements their
topmost turrets lost in the upper
blackness of the night the lights
which they had observed from the
farther shore had now disappeared
they had lost all sense of direction

  they had started groping their way
about step by step when ferris sud-
denly halted laying a restraining
hand on the arm of the trembling
spider listen he whispered
the admonition was scarcely neces-
sary

  they listened intently at first
there came no sound save the pound-
ing of their own hearts and yet
ferriss uncanny faculties had not
deceived him gradually they became
aware that the air about them was
filled not by any peiceptible sound
but by a delicate throbbing a dis-
turbance of the ether which they
sensed rather than heard

  a moments hesitation and ferris
pressed on he had taken the flash-
light once more from his pocket and
was carrying it in his left hand leav-
ing his right free for the butt of his
automatic

  suddenly in their groping they
came upon a blank wall by the
smoothness of the structure under
their fingers they knew it must be dif-
ferent from the rough-hewn stone of
the castle a moments further hesi-
tation and then a small beam of light
shot out from ferriss left hand

  confronting them was a wall of
modern brick

  guardedly the narrow shaft of light
crept down the wall at a distance
of perhaps thirty feet from where
they stood they saw that this brick
barrier had been mortised to one of
the castle buttresses foot by foot the
beam went back the other way fif-
teen paces beyond the point where
they were standing it showed them
that the wall ended still farther
beyond that revealed for a brief sec-
ond in a kaleidoscopic gleam was the
ancient portcullis of blennerhof with
the drawbridge drawn up behind it
ferris snapped off the light appar-
ently then this modern structure
was a sizable brick building built in
the center of the courtyard


weird tales

  they crept along to their left came
to the corner rounded it cautiously
they listened not a sound save that
peculiar faint throbbing still persist-
ing in their consciousness

  ferris tried the flash again and
they saw themselves facing a set of
sliding doors made of steel or galvan-
ized iron above their heads two
narrow slitlike windows looked out
into the court the spider had begun
to recover his lost nerve and so with
a nudge on ferriss elbow he held out
his locked hands stirrup-wise for the
latter to mount it was an old busi-
ness with them ferris swung up and
peered through the slit finally he
tried his flash-cautiously

  the beam found its way into the
murky interior lighting up the gleam-
ing reflectors the polished brass and
burnished steel of what appeared to
be a gigantic motor car this mod-
ern structure then was nothing more
nor less than a garage for this huge
steel beetle ferris breathed easier
and whistled softly through his teeth
small wonder visitors were not wel-
come to castle blennerhof

  slowly as best he could he shot his
narrow beam of light through that
narrow aperture foot by foot his
eyes wandered over the car noting
the huge beaklike hood the slitlike
openings for the eyes of the driver
the heavily armored sides and wheels
and most of all the heavy steel cu-
pola on the roof plainly it was an
armored car but what puzzled him
most of all was that the cupola con-
tained neither rifle nor machine-gun
but a high bulging dome of heavy
greenish glass approximately two feet
in diameter it might be a gigantic
third headlight whose rays could be
directed not only to right and left to
the front and behind but also into
the heavens

  ferris slipped to the ground and
held a whispered consultation with
the spider could the jewels then
be in the castle instead of at the villa

and had this motor car been brought
up into the mountains for their pro-
tection they remembered the as-
sertions of others that the safe must
be at the villa what use could they
have had for such a huge affair as a
stivers-leemy at the villa  why had
they not brought it to the castle if the
jewels were really in the barons cus-
tody very well he would find out

  ferris had grown bolder with his
flashlight now by aid of its narrow
shaft he found an open iron-studded
door at the foot of one of the towers
within was an ancient stone staircase
which they began to ascend it was
a circuitous climb leading far up into
the turret in their ears still rang
that subdued humming growing
slightly louder as they went up pres-
ently they stepped through a narrow
arched doorway out upon the open
battlements even as they did so the
pale arc of the moon rolling out for
the first time beyond its clouds threw
a fitful gleam over the ancient pile
together they peered over the parapet
into the gloom below together they
saw there something that made them
both crouch hastily back within the
shadow of the wall it was several
minutes before they ventured it a sec-
ond time

  they saw then that the castle was
in reality only a shell within the
encircling battlements was a large
interior courtyard stone-flagged to
one side they made out a huge pile of
black lumpish material at the foot of
which the dim outlines of two men
were visible from below their ears
caught the subdued clang of iron

  coal-or im a liar whispered
the spider it was indeed a huge pile
of anthracite

  they were aware now that the hum-
ming had become louder over in erne
comer of the courtyard a white wav-
ing plume of steam floated out into
the night only to be lost long before
it reached the upper battlements
voices from the two men below them
the devil-ray



eame up in low gutturals one of
them trundled a wheelbarrow-load of
coal toward the corner where he dis-
appeared through a doorway pres-
ently they heard the clang of an iron
door and the metallic rattle of a slice
bar

  ferris grunted dynamos he
whispered half to himself it was not
until then that the spider recognized
the now familiar whining hum

  for a time they watched the men
at work on the coal pile wonderingly
ferris knew that the villa was an up-
to-date affair equipped with electric
lights and other modem improve-
ments but he was virtually certain
that the power for these was gener-
ated by a small gas engine in one of
the outbuildings near the servants
quarters furthermore he knew that
the humming in his ears indicated
the presence of dynamos far more
powerful than would be required for
the needs of a mountain villa no
matter how extensive then too
why was it necessary for these men
to work by night musing thus he
crept on about the battlements until
at a point ahead of him he saw a re-
flection of light from one of the small
embrasures they peered into it cau-
tiously what they saw brought an-
other of those low whistles from fer-
ris

the chamber within had apparent-
 ly been built over the engine room
to one side was a short iron ladder
leading up to a row of rheostats and
other electrical paraphernalia with
dials and many wheels attached to a
solid rubber slab on the wall at the
other side jutting through the floor
were the glistening backs of two small
dynamos between them stood the
strangest apparatus of all it was of
thick greenish glass shaped not un-
like a huge hour-glass with the upper
end touching the ceiling and the low-
er part countersunk in the stone floor
out of the ceiling with the upper half

of the hour-glass there jutted a
u-shaped bar of a black substance
apparently carbon a similar bar
was seen under the glass in the lower
half between the two bars there
oscillated a strange purplish light
as they watched they saw it flicker
and flare now forking like a serpents
tongue now a solid ray of purple

  even as they stood there watching
the head and shoulders of a man arose
through an opening in the floor at the
farther comer step by step he
mounted until crouching there as
they were with their eyes just visible
over the window ledge they could
see him plainly--his upstanding crop
of thick gray hair his thin gangling
figure his curiously round and impas-
sive face with deep-set eyes veiled be-
hind thick-lensed glasses he turned
as he stepped out upon the floor and
stooped to help a second man out of
the hole

  the last comer proved to be a
smooth-shaven person with haggard
features and emaciated frame even
as his face eame into full view be-
neath the glare of the lamp overhead
the spider felt ferris stiffen beside
him heard him gasp as though
struggling for breath the tighten-
ing clutch of ferriss hand on the
spiders sleeve sent cold shivers rac-
ing up and down the latters already
trembling spine

   smatter he growled in alarm

  ferris said nothing but continued
to peer in fascination through the
window raising his head until he
must have been fully visible to those
within had they chosen to look up
at times he paused stepped baek into
the darkness and passed his hand over
his eyes when he pressed his face
again to the window the spider saw
that there were great globules of per-
spiration on his forehead though the
night was increasing in coolness

  the little man fidgeted nervously
it was not his custom to question the
actions of his chief but he knew they


weird tales

were losing valuable time finally
he laid his hand on ferriss arm only
to have it flung roughly aside here
again it was strange for ferris
turned to the spider and peered long
and intently into his face lit up as it
was by the dim glow from the win-
dow the spider was no student of
psychology but there was in ferriss
eyes something which made him pan-
icky with fear-a certain vagueness
which was alarming

  how long this went on it seemed
hours the spider scarcely knew
once he thought all was lost when the
second of the two men the emaciated
one suddenly glanced up at the win-
dow the spider could have sworn
that he had seen ferris and the little
mans hand flew to his automatic his
ears attuned for the cry of alarm
instead and the spider could have
sworn it the man in the tower seemed
to stand there for the fraction of a
second staring in fascination at the
window was it a look of recogni-
tion then the man within took a
step across the floor and the spider
raised his weapon one more step-
but the man had stopped he turned
away ah the other had spoken to
him

  from out of the east came the faint
hum of airplane motors only a subtle
throb of the ether the plane was
coming back they must be gone
as roughly as he dared the spider
pulled ferris from the window and
pinning him with all his strength
against the wall signaled for him to
listen

 zoom zoom zoom apparently
they had cut out the silencer and
they were coming nearer had fer-
ris lost his senses would the fool
understand ferris shuddered once
or twice and rubbed his forehead in
a vague perplexed way

  its the plane hissed the spider
are you drunk or crazy we gotta
get outta here and mighty quick

  ferris stiffened his very expres-
sion seemed to change as he turned
his ear to the night wind gad
youre right he mumbled why
didnt you say so before the
spider swore under his breath

they retraced their steps as quiet-
ly as possible and made their way
down through the tower to the court-
yard more groping-for they dared
not use the light now-and they found
the iron ladder leading down under
the bridge to the little stone dock
there was no time to remove their
clothing now so they plunged in as
they were by this time the faint-
zooming from the east had grown to
a deep-throated hum the plane
would be upon them before they were
half-way across the lake yet once
out there in the water they were rea-
sonably safe there was small likeli-
hood of the midnight fliers glancing
down into the waters where they
were

 but what was this out of the
murk to the east came a sudden pur-
plish gleam only a faint glow at
first it grew brighter with the in-
creasing drone of the engines in a
manner that he had never known be-
fore ferris felt the fingers of panic
clawing at his vitals around him
the water grew icily cold he heard
the spider call out something from
behind him there was panic in the
little mans voice and it seemed to
chain his own limbs that had been
a cry of fear-fear of the unknown
turning his head he gazed into the
east there it was its somber wings
outlined against the scudding clouds
but now streaming vertically down
from the fuselage to the surface of the
water was a solid ray of purple light

  the plane roared on drew nearer
somehow ferris knew not why the
fear that froze his limbs now struck
through to his heart instinctively
he felt he must avoid at all costs that

he jerked an indicative thumb over
his shoulder toward the richards resi-

  eh what is it you say de gran-

dancing with sudden excitement a

  but most certainly my com-

which did not concern me alone
come let us go in we will shake the
facts from this mystery of yours as

willis richards power in wall
street and nabob in our little
sub-metropolitan community stood
on the hearth-rug before his library
fire a living testimonial to the truth
of the axiom thatdeath renders all
mankind equals for all his mop of
white hair his authoritative voice and
his imposing embonpoint the great
banker was only a bereft and bewil-
dered old man borne down by his
new sorrow and unable to realize that
at last he confronted a condition not
to be remedied by his signature on a
five-figured check

  well sergeant he asked with a
pitiful attempt at his usual brusk
manner as he recognized costello at
de grandins elbow have you found
out anything

  no sir the policeman confessed
but heres dr de grandin from
paris france and he can help you
out if anyone can hes done some

wonderful work for us before and



  a french detective richards
scoffed you dont need to get one
of those foreigners to help you find
a few stolen jewels do you why



  monsieur de grandins angry
protest brought the irate financiers
expostulation to an abrupt halt you
do forget yourself i am jules de
grandin occasionally connected with
the service de surete but more in-
terested in the solution of my cases
than in material reward

  oh an amateur eh richards
replied with even greater disgust
this is a case for real detective
work costello im surprized that
youd bring a dabbler into my private
affairs by george ill telephone a
new york agency and take the en-
tire case out of your hands

  one moment mr richards i
interposed relying on my position as
family medical adviser to strengthen
my argument this is dr jules de
grandin of the sorbonne one of eu-
ropes foremost criminologists and
one of the worlds greatest scientists
the detection of crime is a phase of
his work just as military service was
a phase of george washingtons but
you can no more compare him with
professional police officers than you
can compare washington with profes-
sional soldiers

  mr richards looked from de gran-
din to me then back again im
sorry he confessed extending his
hand to the little frenchman and
i shall be very glad for any assistance
you may care to render sir

  to be frank-he motioned us to
seats as he began pacing the floor
nervously -   mrs richards  death
was not quite so natural as dr trow-
bridge believes though its perfect-
ly true she had been suffering from
heart disease for some time it was
not heart disease alone which caused
the dead hand



her death she was scared to death
literally

  i returned from new york where
id been attending a banquet given
by my alumni association about 
oclock this morning i let myself in
with my latch key and went upstairs
to my room which adjoined my
wifes and was beginning to undress
when i heard her call out in terror
i flung the connecting door open and
ran into her bedroom just in time to
see her fall to the floor beside her
bed clutching at her throat and try-
ing to say something about a hand
ah de grandin looked at our
host with his sharp cat-stare and
then

  and then i saw-well i fancied
i saw a-a something drift across the
room about level with my shoulders
and go out the window i ran over
to where my wife lay and-and when
i got there she was dead  

 ah murmured de grandin
thoughtfully inspecting his well-man-
icured nails with an air of preoccu-
pation

  richards gave him an annoyed look
as he continued it was not till this
morning that i discovered all my
wifes jewels and about twenty thou-
sand dollars worth of unregistered
liberty bonds had disappeared from
the wall-safe in her room

 of course he concluded i
didnt really see anything in the air
when i ran from my room thats
impossible  

  quite obviously i agreed
sure sergeant costello nodded
not at all jules de grandin de-
nied shaking his head vigorously in
dissent it is more possible your
eyes did not deceive you monsieur
what was it that you saw
richards annoyance deepened into
exasperation it looked like a
hand he snapped a hand with
four or five inehes of wrist attached
to it and no body silly rot of
course i didnt see any such thing

 quod erat demonstrandum de
grandin replied softly

 what say mr richards de-
manded testily

  i said this is truly a remarkable
case  

  well do you want to look at the
room richards turned toward the
door leading to the stairway

  but no monsieur de grandin
blandly refused the good ser-
geant costello has already looked over
the ground doubtless he can tell me
all i need to know i shall look else-
where for confirmation of a possible
theory

  oh all right richards agreed
with a snort of ill-concealed con-
tempt tackle the matter in your
own way ill give you forty-eight
hours to accomplish something then
ill call up blynns agency and see
what real detectives can do

  monsieur is more than generous
in his allowance   de grandin replied
icily

  to me as we left the house he con-
fided i should greatly enjoy pulling
that monsieur richards nose friend
trowbridge

an you come over to my house
 right away dr trowbridge a
voice hailed me as de grandin and
i entered my office

  why mr kinnan i answered
as i recognized the caller whats
the matter

  huh he exploded what isnt
the matter hells broken loose my
wifeshad hysterics since this morn-
ing and im not sure i oughtnt ask
you to commit me to some asylum for
the feeble-minded

  pardieu monsieur de grandin
exclaimed that statement he is vast-
ly interesting but not very instruc-
tive you will explain nest-ce-pasf

 explain growled the other
how am i going to explain some-
thing i know isnt so at twenty


weird tales

minutes past  this morning my wife
and i saw something that wasnt
there and saw it take the lafayette
cup to boot

  sacre nom dun pore de gran-
din swore   what is it that you say 
you saw that which was not there
and saw it take a cup of le marquis
de lafayette non non non it is i
who am of the deranged mind friend
trowbridge look to me i hear re-
marks which this gentleman has not
made

  in spite of himself kinnan laughed
at the little frenchmans tragic face
ill be more explicit he promised
seating himself opposite me and
drawing a cigar case from his pocket
smoke he asked proffering the
case to each of us in turn

  now here goes and i dont care
whether you believe me or not for
im not at all sure im not a liar
myself

  the baby was fretful the entire
early part of the evening and we
didnt get him to sleep till well after
midnight along about  oclock he
woke up on another rampage and my
wife and i went into the nursery to
see what we could do

  ella the maid had gone to new
york for the night and as usual
there wasnt a drop of milk ready for
the youngster so mrs kinnan and
i trotted doavn to the dining room and
i started to pasteurize some milk in
the chafing dish i can place the time
exactly for the library clock has been
running erratically lately and only
yesterday id gotten it so it ran just
ten minutes fast well that clock
had just struck half-past  when-
like an echo of the gong-there came
a crash at the window and the pane
was shattered right before our eyes

  ah observed de grandin non-
committally

  kinnan shot him a sidelong glance
as he continued it had been broken
by a hammer

  ah de grandin edged slightly
forward on his chair

  and whether you believe me or
not that hammer was held in a hand
-a womans hand-and that was all
no arm no body just a hand-a hand
that smashed that windowpane with
a hammer and floated through the
air as if it were attached to an invisi-
ble body and took the lafayette cup
from the sideboard then floated away
with it

  a-a-ahl de grandin ejaculated
on a rising accent forgetting to puff
at the cigar our caller had given him

  oh i dont expect you to believe
me kinnan shot back id say
anyone who told me such a story was
full of dope or something myself
but i tell you i saw it-or thought
i did-and so did my wife anyhow
-he turned to us with a gesture of
finality - the lafayette cup is
gone

  on the contrary monsieur de
grandin assured him gravely i do
believe you most implicitly that
same bodiless hand was seen at mon-
sieur richards home last night
the deuce this time it was
kinnan who looked skeptical you
say someone else saw that hand
wh- why they couldnt
nevertheless my friend they
did the frenchman asserted now
tell me this lafayette cup what was
it

  its a silver wine goblet which be-
longed to my great-grandfather
kinnan replied intrinsically i
dont suppose its worth more than
twenty-five or thirty dollars but its
valuable to us as a family heirloom
and because lafayette when he made
his second visit to this country drank
out of it at a banquet given in his
honor ive been offered up to a
thousand dollars for it by collectors
morbleu de grandin ground
the fire from his cigar in the ash-tray
and beat his fingertips together in a
nervous tattoo   this is a remarkable
the dead hand



burglar we have here messieurs a
most remarkable burglar he-or
she-has a hand but no body he en-
ter sick ladies bedrooms and fright-
ens away their lives then steal their
jewelry he break honest mens win-
dows with a hammer then deprives
them of their treasured heirlooms
while they heat the milk for their ba-
bies cordtieu he will bear investi-
gating this one

  you dont believe me kinnan
declared half truculently half shame-
facedly

 have i not said i do the
frenchman answered almost angrily
when you have seen what i have
seen monsieur-parbleu when you
have seen one-half as much-you
will learn to believe many things
which fools declare impossible

 this hammer-he rose almost
glaring at kinnan so intent was his
stare-where is he i would see
him if you please

  its over at the house our visi-
tor answered lying right where it
fell when the hand dropped it nei-
ther my pfe nor i would touch it for
a farm

  	 tremendous gigantic magnifi-
cent de grandin ejaculated nod-
ding his head vigorously after each
adjective come mes amis let us
hasten let us fly trowbridge my
friend you shall attend the so excel-
lent madame kinnan i i shall go on
the trail of this bodiless burglar and
it shall go hard but i shall find him
morblm monsieur le fantome when
you kill that madame richards with
fright that is one thing when you
steal monsieur kinnans cup of le
marquis de lafayette that is also one
thing but when you think to thumb
your invisible nose at jules de gran-
din-parbleu that is something else
again we shall see who will make
one sacre singe out of whom and that
right quickly

the hammer proved to be an ordi-
nary one with a nickeled head
and imitation ebony handle such as
could be bought at any notion store
for twenty-five cents but de gran-
din pounced on it like a hungry tom-
cat on a mouse or a gold prospector
on a two-pound nugget or a kimber-
ley miner on a twelve-carat diamond

  but this is wonderful this is
superb  he almost cooed as he swad-
dled the implement in several layers
of paper and stowed it tenderly away
in an inside pocket of his great coat

    trowbridge my friend -he
threw me one of his quick enigmatic
smiles-do you attend the good
madame kinnan i have important
duties to perform elsewhere if pos-
sible i shall return for dinner and
if i do i pray you will have your
amiable cook prepare for me one of
her so delicious apple pies if i re-
turn not-his little blue eyes twin-
kled a moment with frosty laughter-
i shall eat all that pie for breakfast
like a good yon-kee

dinner was long since over and
the requested apple pie had been
reposing untouched on the pantry
shelf for several hours when de gran-
din popped from a taxicab like a
jack-in-the-box from its case and
rushed up the front steps the waxed
ends of his little blond mustache
twitching like the whiskers of an ex-
cited tom-cat his arms filled with
bundles-a look of triumphant exhil-
aration on his face quick quick
friend trowbridge he ordered as
he deposited his packages on my office
desk to the telephone call that
monsieur richards that rich man
who so generously allowed me forty-
eight hours to recover his lost treas-
ures and that monsieur kinnan
whose so precious cup of the marquis
de lafayette was stolen-call them
both and bid them come here right
away at once immediately


weird tales

 pardieu-he strode back and
forth across my office with a step
which was half run half jig-this
jules de grandin never is the task
imposed too great for him

  what in the worlds the matter
with you i demanded as i rang up
the richards house

  non non he replied lighting
a cigarette then flinging it away un-
puffed ask me no questions good
friend i do beseech you wait only
wait till those others come then you
shall hear jules de grandin speak
morbleu but he shall speak a great
mouthful

the richards limousine impressive
in size like its owner and like its
owner heavily upholstered was pant-
ing before my door in half an hour
and kinnan drove up in his modest
sedan almost as soon sergeant cos-
tello looking mystified but conceal-
ing his wonder with the inborn reti-
cence of a professional policeman
came into the office close on kinnans
heels

  whats all this nonsense trow-
bridge richards demanded testily
as he sank into a chair couldnt
you have come over to my house in-
stead of dragging me out at this hour
o night

  tut tut monsieur de grandin
cut him short running the admoni-
tions so close together that they
sounded like the exhaust of a minia-
ture motorboat tut tut monsieur
is it not worth coming out into the
cold to recover these prom a
brown-paper parcel before him he
produced a purple velvet case which
he snapped open with a dramatic ges-
ture disclosing an array of scintillat-
ing gems

  these i take it he announced
were once the property of madame
your wife

  great scott gasped richards
reaching out his hands for the jewels
why you got em

 but of course de grandin
agreed deftly withdrawing the stahes
from richards reach and restoring
them to their paper bag also mon-
sieur i have these prom another
parcel he drew a sheaf of liberty
bonds ruffling through them as a
gambler might count his cards you
said twenty thousand dollars worth
i believe tres bien there are just
twenty one-thousand dollar certifi-
cates here according to my count

  monsieur kinnan he bowed to
our other visitor permit that i re-
store to you the cup of monsieur le
marquis lafayette the lafayette
cup was duly extracted from another
package and handed to its owner

  and now de grandin lifted an
oblong pasteboard box of the sort
used for shoes and held it toward us
as a prestidigitator might hold the hat
from which he is about to extract a
rabbit i will ask you to give me
closest attention regardez sil vous
plait is this not what you gentlemen
saw last night

  as he lifted the box lid we beheld
lying on a bed of crumpled tissue pa-
per what appeared to be the perfect-
ly modeled reproduction of a beauti-
ful feminine hand and wrist the
thumb and fingers tipped with long
almond-shaped nails were exquisitely
slender and graceful and the narrow
palm where it showed above the curl-
ing digits was pink and soft-looking
as the under side of a la prance rose
petal only the smear of collodion
across the severed wrist told us we
gazed on something which once pul-
sated with life instead of a marvelous-
ly exact reproduction

  is this not what you gentlemen
saw last night de grandin re-
peated glancing from the lovely hand
to richards and kinnan in turn

  each nodded a mute confirmation
but forebore to speak as though the
sight of the eery lifeless thing before
him had placed a seal of silence on
his lips
the dead hand



  very good very very good de
grandin nodded vigorously now at-
tend me if you please

 when monsieur kinnan told me
of the hammer which broke his win-
dow last night i decided the road by
which to trace this bodiless burglar
was mapped out on that hammers
handle pmrquoi because this
hand which scares sick ladies to death
and breaks windowpanes is one of
three things first-he ticked off
on his fingers-it may be some me-
chanical device in that case i shall
find no traces but it may be the
ghost of someone who once lived in
which case again it is one of two
things a ghost hand per se or the
reanimated flesh of one who is dead
or perchance it is the hand of some-
one who can render the rest of him
invisible

  now then if it is a ghost hand
either true ghost or living-dead flesh
it is like other hands it has ridges
and valleys and loops and whorls
which can be traced and recognized
by fingerprint experts or if a man
can by some process unknown to me
make all of him save his hand invisi-
ble why then his hand too must
leave finger marks hein

   now jules de grandin asked
jules de grandin is it not highly
probable that one who steal jewels
and bonds and the cup of monsieur
le marquis de lafayette has stolen
before perchance been apprehended
and fingerprinted

   parbleu it is even as you say 
jules de grandin answer jules de
grandin

 thereupon i take that hammer
from monsieur kinnans house and
go with it to new york i see the
commissioner of police monsieur
le prefet i say to him i am jules
de grandin do you know me

   morbleu but i do reply that so
excellent gentleman who but a fool
has not heard of jules de grandin 

 he paused a moment casting a
pregnant glance at richards then
continued

   monsieur le prefet i reply i
would that you permit your identifi-
cation experts to examine this ham-
mer and tell me of their kindness
whose fingerprints appear thereon

  bien the order was given and in
good time come the report that the
hammer handle is autographed with
the fingerprints of one katherine
obrien otherwise known to the po-
lice as catherine levoy and also
known as catherine dunstan

  the police of new york have a
dossier for this lady which would do
credit to the paris surete they tell
me she was in turn a shoplifter a
decoy-woman for some badger game
gentlemen a forger and the partner
of one professor mysterio a theatrical
hypnotist indeed they tell me she
was married to this professor a ilta-
lienne and with him she traveled the
country sometimes giving exhibitions
sometimes indulging in crime such
as for instance burglary and pocket-
picking

  now about a year ago while she
and the professor are exhibiting
themselves at coney island this lady
died her partner gave her a most
remarkable funeral but the cere-
monies were marred by one untoward
incident-while her body lay in the
undertakers mortuary some thief did
climb in the window and remove one
of her hands in the dead of night
he severed from the beautiful body of
that wicked woman the hand which
had often extracted property from
other peoples pockets and made off
with it nor could all the policemens
efforts find out who did so ghoulish
a deed

  meantime the professor who was
this womans theatrical partner has
retired from the stage and lives in
new jersey on the fortune he has
amassed


weird tales

   new jersey new jersey i say
to me why that is the place where
my dear trowbridge lives and where
these so mysterious burglaries have
taken place

  so back i come to sergeant cos-
tello and ask him if any stranger
whose mode of income is unknown
has lately moved into this vicinity
i have a picture of this professor
mysterio which the new york police
give me from their archives and i
show the picture to the good costello

   pardim in english he say
but i know the gentleman he live
in the berryman house out on the
andover road and do nothing for his
living but smoke a pipe and drink
whisky come let us gather him in 

  while sergeant costello and i
ride out to that house i do much
thinking hypnotism is thought and
thought is a thing-a thing which
does not die now if this dead wom-
an had been in the habit of receiving
mental commands from professor
mysterio for so long and had been
accustomed to obey those commands
with all parts of her body as soon as
they were given had she not formed
a habit of obedience trowbridge
my friend you are a physician you
have seen men die even as i have
you know that the suddenly killed
man falls in an attitude which was
characteristic of him in life is it not
so

  i nodded agreement

 very well then de grandin
continued i ask me if it is not pos-
sible that the hand this professor have
commanded so many times in life can
not be made to do his bidding after
death mon dieu the idea is novel
but not for that reason impossible
did not that so superb monsieur poe
hint at some such thing in his story
of the dying man who remained alive
because he was hypnotized most as-
suredly

  so when we get to the house of
professor mysterio sergeant costello

points his pistol at the gentleman and
says put em up buddee weve got
the deceased wood upon you  mean-
while i search the house

  i find monsieur richards jewelry
and his bonds i find monsieur rin-
nans cup of monsieur le marquis de
lafayette i find much else includ-
ing this hand of a dead woman which
are not itself dead dieu de dieu
when i go to take it from its case
it attack me like a living thing and
sergeant costello have to promise he
will blow the top from the professors
head before he order it to be quiet
and it obeyed his voice parbleu
when i see that i have the flesh of
the geese all over me

  rot richards flung the con-
temptuous comment like a missile   i
dont know what kind of hocus-pocus
made that hand move but if you
expect to make me believe any such
nonsense as this stuff youve been
telling youve got the wrong pig by
the ear i shouldnt be surprized if
you and this professor whats-his-
name were in cahoots in this thing
and you got cold feet and left your
confederate holding the bag

  i stared aghast at the man de
grandins vanity was as colossal as
his ability and though he was gentle
as a woman in ordinary circum-
stances like a woman he was capable
of sudden flares of vixenish temper
when his regard for human life be-
came no greater than his concern for
a troublesome fly if the little french-
man had launched himself at his tra-
ducer like a bobcat attacking a hound
i should have been less surprized than
i was at the ominous calm with which
he replaced the cover of the card-
board box containing the hand

  friend trowbridge he asked
the muscles of his jaws standing out
like whipcords as he strove to prevent
a telltale quiver from creeping into
his face will you be good enough to
represent me-ha
the dead hand



  with the ejaculation he dodged
suddenly downward almost falling to
the floor in his haste to avoid the
flashing white object which dashed at
his face

  nor was his dodge a split-second
too soon like the lid of a boiling
kettle the top of the shoe box had
lifted and the slender quiescent hand
which lay within had leaped through
the opening risen throat-high in the
air and hurtled across the interven-
ing space like a quarrel from a cross-
bow with delicate firm-muscled fin-
gers outspread it swooped through
the air like a pouncing hawk missed
de grandins throat by the barest
fraction of a second-and fastened
itself snapping like a strong-springed
steel-trap in the puffy flesh sagging
over the collar of willis richards
dress shirt

 ah-ulp gasped or rather
croaked the startled financier falling
backward in his chair and tearing
futilely at the eldritch thing which
sank its long pointed nails into his
purple skin ah-god its choking
me

  costello was at his side striving
with all his force to pry those white
slender fingers open he might as
well have tried to wrench apart the
clasp of a chrome-steel handcuff

  non non de grandin shouted
not that way sergeant it is use-
less

  leaping across the room he jerked
open the door of my instrument case
seized an autopsy knife and dashed
his shoulder against the burly detec-
tive almost sending him sprawling
next instant with the speed and
precision of an expert surgeon he
was dissecting away the deadly white
fingers fastened in richards dewlap

 cest complet he announced
matter-of-factly as he finished his
grisly task a restorative if you
please friend trowbridge and an
antiseptic dressing for the wounds

from the nails he will not suffer un-
necessarily

  wheeling he seized the receiver
from my desk telephone and called
authoritatively alio alio the jail
if you please mademoiselle central

   there was a brief parley finally he
 received his connection then auo
 monsieur le geolier can you tell me
 of professor mysterio please how
 is he what does he do

  a pause ah do you say so i
thought as much many thanks mon-
sieur

   he turned to us a look of satisfac-
 tion on his face my friends he
 announced solemnly professor mys-
 terio is no more two minutes ago
 the authorities at the city prison
 heard him call out distinctly in a loud
 voice katie kill the frenchman i
 command you kill him  when
 they rushed to his cell to discover the
 cause for his cries they were but in
 time to see him dash himself from his
 bed having first bound his waist-belt
 firmly to his throat and the top of
 his barred door the fall broke his
 neck he died before they could cut
 him down

   eh bien he shook himself like a
spaniel emerging from a pond
 twas a lucky thing for me i saw
that box top begin to lift and had the
sense to dodge those dead fingers
none of you would have thought of
the knife i fear before the thing had
strangled my life away as it is i
acted none too soon for monsieur
richards good

   still red in the face but regaining
 his self-possession under my ministra-
 tions willis richards sat up in his
 chair if youll give me my prop-
 erty ill be getting out of this hell-
 house he announced gruffly reach-
 ing for the jewels and bonds de gran-
 din had placed on the desk

 assuredly monsieur de gran-
din agreed but first you will com-
ply with the law nest-ce-pasf you
have offered a reward of five thousand


weird tales

dollars for your propertys return
make out two checks if you please
one for half the amount to the good
sergeant costello the other for a
similar amount to me

  ill he hanged if i do the bank-
er declared glaring angrily at de
grandin why should a man have
to buy his own stuff back

  sergeant costello rose ponderously
to his feet and gathered the parcels
containing richards belongings into
his capacious hands laws law
he announced decisively therell
be no bonds or jools returned till
that rewards been paid

  all right all right richards
agreed reaching for his checkbook
ill pay you but its the damndest
hold-up ive ever had pulled on me

ljm growled costello as the
a door slammed behind the irate
banker if i ever catch that bird
parkin by a fireplug or exceedin th

speed limit hell see a hold-up that is
a hold-up  ill give im every sum-
mons in my book an holler for
more  

  tiens my friends think of the
swine no more de grandin com-
manded in france had a man so
insulted me i should have called him
out and run him through the body
but that one pouf gold is his
lifes blood i hurt him far more by
forcing the reward from him than
if i had punctured his fat skin a
dozen times

 meantime friend trowbridge
-hisi little eyes snapped with the
heat-lightning of his sudden smile-
there waits in the pantry that so
delicious apple pie prepared for me
by your excellent cook sergeant-
monsieur kinnan will you join us
wind and weather permitting
friend trowbridge and i purpose
eating ourselves into one glorious case
of indigestion

softly he bent over the form of the lovely
girl- and the beauty of the great room was
dwarfed by comparison to the loveliness of
lun pei lo

with the first breath of night
canton becomes a city of
mystery a place of lurking
shadows of soft-cadenced subdued
voices of lanterns flickering wistfully
out from the folds of darkness of a
thousand varied odors some revolt-
ing others that seem to possess all
the allure and incense of the east

 that evening as i wandered
through the narrow alleys that wind
through the city like snakes i no-
ticed a chinaman standing in the
doorway of a tea-house he was very
tall like a great reed and he swayed

somewhat which emphasized the sim-
ile he was dressed in a soft black
shapeless suit unrelieved by any
touch of color a suit which seemed
to have been cut from the velvet
blackness of the oriental night his
face was yellow but so pale that it
seemed almost white and his eyes lay
in great pits they glowed with a
strange brilliancy like the eyes of a
forest animal or of a man who has
crossed the threshold of reason his
nose was a monstrosity crushed flat
against his face and his lips were so
thin they hardly existed they

                                 


weird tales

made no effort to ride his huge yellow
teeth

  as i gazed into his face i paused
for he was smiling hideously and
beckoning to me

  if you will buy me some tea he
said in a soft voice which wa beauti-
fully modulated i will tell you a
tale of adventure and romance -that
will cause your ennui to slip from you
like a cloak

 how did you know i was in
search of adventure i demanded

  that was very simple said he
when it grows cloudy one knows
that it will rain one judges the
weather by gazing on the face of na-
ture one judges a mans mood like-
wise by gazing into his face

  he led the way into the tea-house
as he spoke and in a few seconds we
were seated at a small table in a far
corner the tea-house was dimly
lighted and the scattered forms that
slunk about the room seemed like
wraiths overhead several lanterns
burned dimly yellow-blue lanterns
that caressed the room with a peace-
ful shimmering light a sleek china-
man brought us tea and then silently
withdrew my companion closed his
eyes and breathed deeply of the sweet
aroma that rose softly to his nostrils

  tea he said softly tea is a
beverage of enchantment it brings
happiness and dreams it brings for-
getfulness it is a medicine to cure
all physical and moral ills   he
paused for a moment then he said
my name is yuan yung and i dwell
not far from here on an island in the
great river what the island is
called matters little where it is mat-
ters less sufficient it is that there
is such an island for it is an island
like unto none that you have ever
chanced upon

  again he paused for a moment and
breathed deeply of the tea aroma i
marveled that he made no effort to
lift the dainty green-jade cup to his
lips

  on my island he continued no
sound is ever heard not a bird
sings not a flower laughs in the wind
even the great tree-tops are subdued
it is an island of sorrow all nature
is mourning mourning for little lun
pei lo who used to make our island
a floral garden of loveliness by her
singing yon who have heard the
greatest singers of the occident have
yet to hear anything comparable to
the singing of lun pei lo for when
she sang even the flowers joined in
the chorus they blossomed more
beautifully and fragrantly than ever
and the trees like great violins softly
joined in the music they swayed in
perfect rhythm and made music
which even the spheres might envy
he only is a great singer who can
harmonize with nature and lun pei
lo was even greater for nature har-
monized with her life is a peculiar
thing men wander through the val-
ley toward the shadowy death caves
beyond and always they think of at-
taining wealth and riches and power
none of these is of the slightest im--
portance the wealth of the world is
contained in sweet incense the aroma
of tea in beautiful pictures in music
and in the glory of the skies when
we arrive at that station in life where
we can estimate values there will no
longer be any necessity for dying
life will be complete on our island
little lun pei lo sang and all things
joined in her songs but now little
lun pei lo has gone and the trees
are silent the flowers are hushed and
the birds no longer sing nothing
but sadness remains even the great
serpent who sleeps beneath the moun-
tains mourns for her

  if i would not be presuming i
hazarded i should like very much
to visit your island

  he looked up quickly and his eyes
narrowed until they were little more
than slits i will take you there this
very night he said emphatically
the silent trees



after that we sat in silence i
finished my tea and waited for
him to do likewise but he made no
effort to raise the cup to his lips he
just inhaled the aroma until the tea
had cooled after which he reluctantly
rose to his feet together we ambled
through the winding crisscross alleys
of canton he held my arm with
fingers of steel as though he feared
i might flee they bit into my flesh
like teeth at last we arrived at the
waters edge it was pitch-black
yuan yung clambered into a small
boat from the bow of which hung a
lantern and i followed after him
when we were both seated he extin-
guished the light the water was
blacker than a river of jet and i could
not make out the form of my com-
panion the sky was overcast and
there was no moon the night air
was cold and cheerless and a sharp
wind blew fitfully over the waters

  soon the boat began to move i
assumed that yuan yung was rowing
although i heard no sound of oars
the boat cut through the water as
though it had no more texture than a
phantom the night was lifeless and
still on and on we drifted as the
moments passed i grew drowzy it
was very peaceful not a sound not
a sigh at last i must have fallen
into a deep sleep for the next thing i
knew it was morning

  i gazed slowly about me to my
surprize i lay beside a marvelous blue
lake a lake bluer than an april sky
yuan yung was nowhere in sight
gone also was the boat in which we
had come to the island for awhile i
waited for him to return drinking in
the beauty of the panorama that un-
folded all about me hills covered
with verdant trees etched sharply
against a coral-blue sky the grass
was greener than any grass i had
ever seen and there were wild flow-
ers in profusion growing on every
side flowers of every color and
hue a perfect riot of beauty

the air was so clear that i could
see for miles about and because of
the immensity of the canvas on which
i gazed everything seemed dwarfed
by comparison i was in a miniature
world of loveliness it was also a
soundless world not the faintest
murmuring rent the solitude the
trees were so still they might have
been painted on a white sheet even
the flowers did not move no bird
sang nor could i detect the faintest
suggestion of a breeze it was so calm
and lifeless that it made me shiver
i called aloud for yuan yung but
my voice died out almost instantly
without echo i called again but it
was useless the air refused to take
up my voice i began to perspire as
though some awful menace were at
my heels i was afraid to look back
it was ridiculous to succumb to nerves
on such a perfect day the sky was
clear and on every hand i was en-
veloped in beauty it was so beauti-
ful that it was nauseating i felt as
though the very perfectness of the
picture were stifling me stealing my
breath binding me with chains for
awhile i waited by the roadside then
i commenced to walk even my foot-
falls made no sound it was an island
of dreadful silence

 on and on i wandered the road
wound over a slight hill and then
dipped into a forest and i passed
along it as though i were lost in a
dream all nature was soundless as
though it had paused for some great
event perhaps to listen to the singing
of lun pei lo my mind at that
moment was as clear as crystal all
the worthless dross of life had been
washed out had life stopped on the
island when lun pei lo vanished
would the current of existence cease
to flow onward until her return
these were mad thoughts but at the
moment they seemed logical enough
sanity at best is but a relative con-
dition a man slightly mad seems
normal as compared to a maniac few

tales

persons of earth are mentally in abso-
lute balance superstitions are slight
forms of insanity and often one is de-
clared insane simply because he has
views which one can not understand

  there was something awesome
about that soundless road i was ter-
rified many things there were as
mysterious as the blue lake i noticed
that the few coral clouds in the sky
did not move stationary also was
the sun it did not even seem to cast
off heat as it blazed down neither
was the air cold the climate was
neutral i marveled at this but not
nearly as much as at the fact that i
cast no shadow i had read that only
the dead cast no shadows it was an
old belief ancient also was the say-
ing that a mans shadow is really his
soul when one casts no shadow one
has lost ones soul i had never given
credence to such fantasies yet now
that i cast no shadow i shuddered
was i dead was i a ghost i
laughed mirthlessly at the bare
thought but no sound came from my
lips i too was voiceless as sound-
less as the silent trees now i quick-
ened my pace i sped down the road
as though pursued by the wrath of
the gods my blood froze in my veins
my heart almost stopped beating my
lips grew cold the whole island
seemed to be a seething menace yet
it was more beautiful than a land-
scape by corot

  soon i came to a gray city a de-
serted city the weirdest place in
which i had ever walked it was as
though some horrible plague had
driven the inhabitants from their
homes i roamed through street after
street of gray houses all deserted and
dead they stood somberly malignant
like bleached bones from which all
flesh had been torn by vultures all
were of peculiar design built like
shelves each floor with a stone bal-
cony opening into rooms of yawning
blackness i who had always hated
noise and clamor who had yearned

for solitude was now crushed by the
weight of that velvet silence it en-
meshed me as it lay about me in folds
my tongue was parched and dry my
lips blistered and cracked i drew
my blackened tongue across my lips
but it was without moisture the
rasping feel of it made me shudder

how long i wandered helplessly
about i do not know but the
next thing i remember i was stand-
ing in front of a house it was a gray
house a forbidding house not one bit
different from the others yeti it ar-
rested my attention something with-
in me i know not what urged me to
enter that house it was a command
more subtle than the perfume of pop-
pies but i acceded to it without ques-
tion it was an onward urge that
could not be disputed i paused for
a moment to get my courage some-
what into shape then i entered the
house at first the halls seemed as
gloomy as a night fog an effect
heightened by my sudden transition
from the glaring sunlight to the sub-
dued shadows but as my vision grad-
ually cleared i gasped at the vast
splendor that lay before me it was
as though the city had been drained
of all its grandeur until it was a drab
thing in order that all the color and
beauty might be concentrated into
this one house i knew instinctively
that all the other houses would be as
gray and colorless within as their
drab exteriors

  all about were rich rugs and tap-
estries rugs and draperies of every
material and color there were lamps
and lanterns of all shapes and sizes
magnificent vases and small idols of
solid gold set with diamonds and
pearls and precious stones on the
floor was a jade-green carpet more
luxurious than grass

  in awe i passed through the rooms
even though everything was as silent
as death i walked slowly it was hard
to realize that i could not make a
the bilent trees



sound all the furnishings of the
rooms were in excellent condition so
it was strange that i should associate
the grim building with great age
still the suggestion of age persisted

  at last i came to a room larger and
higher-vaulted than any of the others
the wealth of the house now dimmed
by comparison to the wealth i found
here only gautier could do justice
in description it was so gorgeous
that it stunned there is more in-
toxication in a truly beautiful picture
than in rare wine here the colors
were more of one tone blues of ex-
quisite harmony soft velvets and
silks more fragile than cobwebs
through a great window the sun
splashed into the room in wondrous
glory drenching everything with a
soft yellow light nothing i thought
could be more beautiful than this
and yet almost immediately i
changed my mind for in a far corner
i beheld the form of a lovely girl
softly i bent over her and just as the
loveliness of tlie other rooms had been
dwarfed by comparison to the wealth
of this one so was the beauty of the
great room dwarfed by comparison to
the loveliness of lun pei lo for i
knew that it was she the same voice
that urged me to enter the house now
acquainted me with the name of the
sleeping girl her eyes were closed
but the lids were blue canopied by
lashes of wondrous length which ca-
ressed her cheeks like ivory was her
skin ivory which though pale seemed
to glow with an inward pink coral
light her lips were very red softer
and more fragrant than any flower
lying there she seemed very young
little more than a child her body
though perfectly formed was small
and fragile and i longed to crush her
in my arms as though she were indeed
a flower

  at that moment time ceased to be
for me even as it had ceased to be for
the other things upon the island i
just stood and gazed down on the

sleeping girl in open adoration never
had i been as intense in my religious
worship as i was in my worship of
that girl

  i tried to picture how gorgeous she
must be when those soft eyes were
open my forehead throbbed i was
as much a slave as any of the heroes
told about in greek legend i longed
to rouse lun pei lo from her sleep to
hear her sing to behold her smile
for the moment i forgot that the
island was more silent than the heart
of the great desert that moment
was the turning point in my life i
knew that having once seen the love-
liness of lun pei lo everything
would be changed thereafter

my reveries were interrupted by a
sudden dull murmur it came
like a shock the house trembled as
though it were about to awake from
a long sleep it sounded more fright-
ful to me than if it had been at drum-
pitch at last the menace which i
had felt was about to confront me
i wished to flee but i could not leave
little lun pei lo to the mercies of un-
known invisible terrors i hesitated
for a moment only then i seized her
in my arms at once the most awful
thing happened that man could dream
of her form was as light as air as
light as though it were but a shell
and as i drew her to me she crumpled
into dust even as mummies ofttimes
crumble that have been hidden for
centuries in egyptian tombs one
moment she had lain before me as
lovely as any flower the next she was
but dust at my feet dully i stood
and gazed down upon the spot where
she had vanished the lovely face
was gone never to return mechan-
ically i stooped and picked up a large
blue-purple amethyst which had hung
from a golden chain about her neck

  and now the murmurings in-
creased to a mighty roar a roar that
shattered the crystal silence into a
thousand tinkling fragments it was


weird tales

the last thing that cut the thread of
my rationality stark raving mad i
rushed from the house the spell of
the canopy of silence was broken
echo ran rampant throughout the
island the trees began to sway
they seemed to be moaning pell-
mell i rushed up a white winding
road until i emerged on a shelf of
rock overhanging the deep blue lake
not for a moment did i hesitate but
leaped into space death itself was
preferable to the unseen horrors of
that island as i plunged into the
lake it was like plunging into the sky

  mercifully at that moment uncon-
ciousness closed in about me it was
the end i thought and i was glad
perhaps in death i could join the
lovely little lun pei lo

when i again opened my eyes all
was blackness about me i
could not see a foot in any direction
my head throbbed dully and a nau-
seating sweet fragrance floated to my
nostrils for one wild moment i re-
flected that i must be at the bottom
of the blue lake but i dismissed that
thought almost instantly my brain
was somewhat in balance and i was
beginning to think sanely again i
felt about me until my hand encoun-
tered that which was evidently a cur-
tain i pushed it slowly aside and
beheld an old chinaman seated beside
a table on which a feeble lamp
burned he was rolling some black
gummy pellets i watched him in-
tently for awhile then i arose and
walked over to his side my knees
were stiff my legs were as wobbly as
though i were a hundred

  can you tell me i asked how
i happen to be here

  he shook his head how can i
said he slowly though undoubt-
edly you are here for the same thing
that all others come for-opium

  i was in a quandary how long
have i been here i asked

  who knows he droned shrug-
ging his shoulders perhaps two
days perhaps three what does it
matter anyway since that which
has gone belongs to the past why
ponder over it   

  i drew two gold pieces from my
pocket he eyed them greedily as i
jingled them in my palm who
brought me here i persisted

  he twisted his shrunken lips with
his fingers his eyes narrowed with
the great effort of thinking then he
said a man who was tall and thin
so thin that he might have been the
shadow of a pestilence

  i slid one of the gold pieces across
the table to him and without prelim-
inaries i told him of my adventures
on the island of the blue lake

  when i had finished he eyed me
queerly of course you have been
steeped in opium for days he said
  and your story can not be given cre-
dence  but at least it is odd for we of
china have an old legend about lun
pei lo who lived over two thousand
years ago she was a great singer
it was she who introduced melody
into china according to the legend
a wizard fell in love with her and car-
ried her away he was captivated by
her he brought her flowers and
jewels and wrought gold in profusion
but failed to make her happy he
worshiped her as the earth worships
the sun but to no avail she pined
for the lover of her childhood daily
she grew thinner and thinner until
her life was almost extinct in de-
spair the wizard changed her lover
into a reed which ever after grew be-
side the blue lake such is the leg-
end you must have been thinking
of it when you came to this house and
it became entwined in your dreams
perhaps you are right i said
slowly but i did not tell him that at
that very moment i held in my hand
a gorgeous blue-purple amethyst
which little lun pei lo had once
worn upon her breast
some rushed for the after cabin but they were cut off
by a slimy arm that slid across their path it spread and
lifted with terrorizing rapidity

nly i escaped the man
whom they had found adrift
in the dory hung his head
the others-the listeners bent
nearer to catch his throatily whis-
pered words-the others  it got
them - that monstrous cursed
thing his eyes rolled back show-
ing bloodshot whites his body tensed
and then he shook as with the ague
his attempt to say more resulted in
stuttering failure

   w t-

  he had better be put to bed
the ships doctor said his nerves
are all gone heat and thirst and
exposure of course hallucinations
hell come out of it in time

  so they put him in the hospital
where he raved for three days and
the things he said caused intense in-
terest on board the freighter pacific
belle and among the crew lurking
fear whispered that some of the
things he said were true
 

weird

tales

it was a week before he came into
his right mind again and then
the fevers and fears which had beset
him passed he was able to talk to
the captain and to tell a coherent
story

  there were seven of us he said
with sad recollection as he glanced
at the ships officers who had gath-
ered about him on the poop deck
who set out in a two-topmaster-
the scudder it belonged to bob
henry who was our captain just
a sort of lark you know-an idle
cruise for the joy of the sea and the
freedom

  i was mate for next to bob i
knew more about handling a ship
than the others and so we sailed
along the coast putting into what-
ever ports we fancied and living an
idle ideal life all of us had long
been friends

  then we rashly decided to make
it across the pacific depending on a
season of few storms to aid us we
were successful honolulu was easy
and from there we headed southward
made the marquesas and then we
sailed from island group to island
group-you know them all-until we
made the philippines

 there we turned homeward
pointing our course for guam but
midway to apia our luck failed and
we were becalmed for days we had
a small auxiliary motor which we
used for a time to make headway
but it got out of order and we were
forced to remain in virtually the
same spot for nearly a week we
did not especially mind for we were
in no great hurry except that it was
somewhat monotonous with so very
little to do

  one evening during our becalmed
period just toward sunset hal
rooney pointed out a great disturb-
ance of the water some little distance
from us it shot up in sprays and
eddied in a most inexplicable man-
ner and then it suddenly ceased we

wondered about it for a long while
but no thinking or imagining or de-
ducing on our part could explain the
phenomenon

   possibly bob henry said it
will appear again 

  and sure enough it did the
next evening at the same hour we
again noted that strange disturbance
of the water we knew that it could
not possibly be a whale nor any oth-
er large sea-creature of which we had
ever heard for the tumult was too
vast and the fact that none of us
could offer an explanation of the mys-
tery piqued our curiosity

  	 the calm continued the sea
floated away from us endlessly equal-
ly on all sides caught at the edges of
the sky and became one with it
once in a while a blackfish went blow-
ing by or an occasional whale the
waters teemed with life at night
the phosphor glow was almost livid
uncannily brilliant and each eve-
ning that same disturbance of the
water occurred somewhere in our
neighborhood

  it was with the third appearance
that the thing became too much for
us we determined to put out in a
dory and investigate the next time it
appeared it did not disappoint us
again at sunset while the sky
glowed extravagantly flaunting an
enormous batik at the parting day
the water almost dead ahead of our
bows broke into a churning fury we
piled into the dory which was ready
alongside and made for it pulling
as hard as we could but before we
were able to reach the spot the mael-
strom had ceased and we gazed into
the intense indigo of unruffled water
that was nearly five miles deep

  following that attempt we were
more determined than ever to find
out the nature of the thing it was
an amazingly large patch of sea that
it churned and though the unbroken
immensity of the space we were the
center of gave us little for compari-
the man who was saved



son we judged the area to be ap-
proximately that of an acre-an un-
believably large expanse to show
such agitation in the midst of so
glassily calm a sea

  the next afternoon just as the
sun fell into the sea splashing all our
horizons with myriad tints a huge
whale went lolling by sounding and
coming up with great jets of water
cascading over it i watched with
the glasses as it drove powerfully
through the water peacefully taking
its time suddenly however it
changed it displayed signs of con-
fusion of alarm first it turned one
way then another cutting about
sharply-and then i very distinctly
heard it give a groan of anguish it
was a heart-breaking sound-the cry
of a great helpless animal in mortal
distress immediately afterward the
water surrounding it broke into its
daily wild disorder and the leviathan
seemed gripped by a force it could
not escape it struggled violently
throwing its huge bulk about with fu-
tile effort greater and greater the
melee became and then suddenly the
whale was still

  we looked at one another fright
in our eyes it was tremendous aw-
ful and then as we looked again
out there the whae lost all shape
and the water became red with gore
and blood as it was crashed to a pulp
in but a few minutes it was gone ut-
terly vanished from view-even the
bloodiness of the water cleared-the
whirling and splashing ceascd and
the sun went down on a still sea all
of us were speechless it was the
most dreadful thing any of us had
ever seen

the speaker paused in his narra-
tive shaken by the memory of
what he had related the captain
and his officers looked at one another
with veiled skepticism the doctor
raised an eyebrow there seemed no
doubt of it the man was insane

  presently he went on with his wild-
ly impossible yam his listeners
were attentive but secretly unbeliev-
ing in time it was hoped he might
regain his mental balance in the
meanwhile-

    to say that we were shaken
would not be half expressing our
state of mind it was so inexplicable
so wildly preposterous i was for
getting away as soon as possible and
so were several of the others but
the rest were keen to learn what the
thing was and to settle any argu-
ment the calm held unbroken and the
motor continued in disrepair despite
our efforts over it

  for three days then the thing
did not come to the surface we had
decided that it was some sort of deep-
sea creature some gargantuan mon-
ster that came out of the vast depths
of the ocean to feed but we had
never heard of such a thing save in
stories of early navigators supersti-
tions we hesitated to bel eve the
thing we had seen-we were afraid to
believe it

  it was now that fear came to us
hitherto we had been curious idly
speculative and inclined to laugh
now our thoughts were interrupted
by premonitions of disaster flying
fish as they flashed from the surface
and splashed into the water about us
startled and porpoises blundering
into our vicinity brought us all on
deck at night a lost puff of breeze
slatting the rigging against the sails
startled us into alarmed awakening
and though the same subject of pos-
sible danger from the unknown out
of the deep occupied the mind of
each of us it was never spoken of
but there was in the air a chilling
presence of dread

  i believe we would have left that
place had we been abe for the
memory of the fate of the whale was
ever vivid in our minds following
the death of the whale the monster
did not rise however for three days


weird tales

as i have said this gave us some
sense of relief but it was on that
third day that the great tragedy oc-
curred

  i was occupied with fitting a new
seat to the dory whieh was swung
up on deck and the others were
idling making bets as to the quarter
in which the creature would next ap-
pear or if we should see it again

  i was startled by a scream from
one of the men and immediately after
followed the sound of churning water
-a sound whieh sent the very essence
of dread all through me and cowed
my soul somehow i knew we were
in the midst of the monsters rise to
the surface i stood and looked over
the side there was a horrible mass
of pulsating green matter-a revolt-
ing substance that had no definite
form and yet was solid-a writhing
heaving island of the stuff

  even as i looked it surged up
from the water and rolled over the
side of the schooner turning over on
itself slithering and cascading on
the deck every one of us was fran-
tic some rushed for the after cabin
but they were cut off by a slimy arm
that slid across their path it spread
and lifted with terrorizing rapidity
two of the men tried to climb a mast
bob henry raced toward the bow and
fell an instant later he was covered
with the gruesome matter even be-
fore he had a chance to cry out and
was hidden from sight hardly
knowing what i did i turned the
dory over on myself dragging mark
whittmore the nearest man to me
under with me fortunately i had
removed all the seats and there was
just room for the two of us as we
lay prone

  then came darkness and an in-
conceivably foul odor of decay as the
monster mass pushed itself over the
dory - a suffocating interminable
dailtness while we were cramped un-
der that flat-bottomed boat scarce
daring to think even of the horror

that crawled over us when we
thought our lungs would burst for the
want of fresh air light came under
the dory once more and gradually the
slithering churning swishing of that
thing which had boarded us ceased
for a long while however we were
too frightened to move but finally
our concern for the fate of our com-
panions compelled us to lift the dory

  the sky glowed with the last rays
of the setting sun and the sea slept
beneath it undisturbed but the decks
of the scudder were wet with a yel-
low-green malodorous slime and si-
lence hung like a pall over the ship

  we called there was no answer
-not even the mockery of an echo
with consternation seizing us we
rushed into the afterhouse but it was
without a person in it in a panic we
ran to the forecastle and it too was
suggestively deserted and nowhere
on that ship did we find a soul
every man except ourselves had dis-
appeared that thing-his voice
broke and again into his face came
that haunting pain-that thing had
got them allt

 for a while he paused making
strong effort to overcome his rising
emotion and the fear that memory
brought him the listeners looked
away and were silent and presently
they heard his voice firmly continu-
ing the tale

  you can not conceive of the ter-
ror whieh descended on us after that
frightful discovery aimlessly dazed-
ly we searched the vessel through and
through but we were the only men
aboard the scudder it was a fact
that we had to face but could not
bring ourselves to believe

  night came quickly and the moon
and stars stared coldly down on us
we decided at length that to remain
on the ship would be suicidal for the
calm still hung over the water like a
dead thing and the thought of the
unspeakable thing that lived some-
where beneath us was appalling so
the man who was saved



we fitted the dory with water and
food and rowed away in the night
from that ill-fated ship

  then there came interminable
days of torture under a malignant
sun and nights of terror of what
might lurk in the waters around us
and one morning i awoke to find my-
self alone in the dory the day be-
fore mark had talked of insanity and
i believe that he could not face the
possibility

  now i attained the utmost in de-
spair i was i believe too shocked
to think clearly or i too might have
gone over the side from the morn-
ing of that discovery until you
picked me up i was in a coma of
the passage of time i do not recall

  and such is my story gentlemen
you may find it hard to believe i
find it difficult myself and wonder
sometimes if it is not an insane con-
ception of diseased imagination i
wish it were but i am tormented
with the reality

phe pacific belle held her west-
ward course for manila the
story of the man who had been saved
spread among the crew where it was
hotly debated and quite generally ac-
cepted the officers of the ship how-
ever avoided the subject and par-
ticularly before the stranger it was
never mentioned

  but one morning just at dawn a
derclict schooner was sighted the
captain awakened ordered the pa-
cific belle hove to while investigation
was made with closer inspection and
increasing light it was made out to be
the scudder of san francisco the
man who had been saved was called

  yes he cried yes thats
the boat-our schooner but-

  he drooped swayed the mate
caught him and called one of the
crew

  take him to his cabin he said
and keep him theie

  investigation corroborated the
statements the stranger had made
furthermore the scudders papers
proved beyond doubt that the man
they had aboard came from her and
since there was nothing to indicate
that anything else could have possi-
bly driven the men from the ship
their strange passengers story as-
sumed a verity that even the officers
reluctantly admitted

  a short consultation decided the
fate of the scudder left as she was
derelict she would have become a
serious menace to shipping and pos-
sible salvage value did not warrant
the long tow into port dynamite
was placed amidships and set off

  with a splintering crash the scud-
der heaved upward and outward and
plunged into the deeps of the ocean
the pacific belle continued on her
way 

  later in the day the captain stud-
ied his charts do you think he
asked the mate at length that there
is really anything in the fellows
story

  the mate shrugged such things
he answered readily dont happen
hes off thats all all the men were
gone from the scudder yes but id
hate to accept such an explanation
for it

  the water in this part of the
ocean mister the captain slowly
said is five miles deep-as deep as
the tallest mountain is high its
barely possible that theres a lot about
things out here that we dont know
or even remotely suspect how-
ever-

that night after the swollen moon
went down and after all slept
save the watches and the man who
had come aboard from out of the
ocean the pacific belle plunged into
stark brief terror

  the stranger affected by again see-
ing the scudder had been unable to
sleep after hours of restlessness he


weird tales

had gone to the bows where he stared
dully across the water as he stood
there slowly almost imperceptibly
he felt himself to be afraid

  an odor had come to him an odor
which brought to his mind the hor-
ror of his last day aboard the scud-
der-the sickening decay-laden odor
of the monster from the deep then
he listened with super-intent ears
and above the vessels vibration he
caught a sound of churning swirling
water he screamed with a loudness
that awoke everyone on the pacific
belle as he recognized these things-
a scrcam that brought everyone to
his feet anticipating calamity

  he turned from the prow and ran
in stumbling haste across the deck
and up the ladder to the bridge the
mate was there alarmed at the cry
of horror

  mister he gasped his mouth
dry with panic mister  the thing
-the monster stop the ship re-
verse her for gods sake

  the mate laughed with relief as he
recognized the man he had been in
dread of something terrible and it
was only another fit

  come now old boy he said in
an effort to comfort better quiet

down a bit dont-

  with another terrible scream the
fellow was gone from the bridge
jerking a preserver from the rail he
leaped free of the pacific belle

 man overboard the mate had
seen him disappear and gave the
alarm as he ran to the bridge controls
but before lie reached them the speed
of the pacific belle slackened abrupt-
ly as though it had fouled the meshes
of a gigantic net and then it lost
headway altogether a bright eery

glow of phosphorescent green lighted
the water in a vast area suddenly
bursting into a lurid brilliance which
caught the vessel out of the night and
revealed its helplessness to the stars

  the glowing green mass surged
sweepingly toward the vessel piled
against it rolled over it clinging to
its sides flooding its decks men who
had come out to investigate the shout-
ing and confusion frantically rushed
below deck barricading ports and
doors behind them on his bridge
the captain sent useless messages to
the engine room the ship could not
move

  then slowly inexorably as the
brilliance of the phosphorescent light
lessened the great mass which was its
source began to sink gradually it
settled carrying the pacific beue
fair-sized steamer though she was
down with it the waves closed over
the ships main deck touched and
submerged the bridge poured down
the funnels sending clouds of steam
hissing into the air and finally even
the tops of the masts disappeared
there had been no time for a wire-
less message but a message would
have been futile

  again the waters calmed but after
a half-hour they were tom for a few
minutes by a great rush of bubbles
to the top following the caving in
from depth pressure of the pacific
belles bulkheads but after that
the surface was never more disturbed
by the pacific belle

  microcosmic in a terrifying vast-
ness of water a man floated on a
preserver in the path of a liner that
later picked him up and as he
slowly realized the irony of his second
escape he sobbed with futile pity for
himself

june  

my dear mare-

  having received no answer to my
card i can only surmise that it did
not reach you i am writing from my
summer home here on the moor a
very secluded place i am fondling
the hope that you will give me a
pleasant surprize by dropping in on
me soon as you hinted you might
for this is just the kind of house that
would intrigue you it is very simi-
lar to the baskerville home which sir
arthur conan doyle describes in his
hound of the baskervilles vague
rumors have it that the place is the
abode of evil spirits which idea i
promptly and emphatically pooh-
poohed you know that in the spir-
itual world i am but slightly inter-

ested and that it is in wizardry that i
delight the thought that this quiet
little building in the heart of eng-
lands peaceful moors should be the
home of a multitude of evil spirits
seems very foolish to me however
the surroundings are exceedingly
healthful and the house itself is part-
ly an antique which arouses my in-
terest in archeology so you see there
is enough to divert my attention from
these foolish rumors leon my valet
is here with me and so is old morti-
mer you remember mortimer who
always prepared such excellent bach-
elor dinners for us 

  i have been here just twelve days
and i have explored this old house
from cellar to garret in the latter
i brought to light an aged trank
which i searched and in which i
found nine old books several of whose
title pages were torn away one of
the books which i took to the small
garret window i finally distinguished


weird tales

as dracula by bram stoker and this
i at once decided was one of the first
editions of the book ever printed

  at the cessation of the first three
days a typical english fog descended
with a vengeance upon the moor at
the first indication of this prank of
the elements which threatened com-
pletely to obscure the beautiful
weather of the past i had hauled out
all the discoveries i had made in the
garret of this building bram stok-
ers dracula i have already men-
tioned there is also a book on the
black art by de rochas three
books by orfilo swedenborg and
cagliostro i have laid temporarily
aside then there are also strind-
burgs the inferno blavatskys se-
cret doctrine poes eureka and
flammarions atmosphere you my
dear friend may well imagine with
what excitement these books filled me
for you know i am inclined toward
sorcery orfilo you know was but a
chemist and physiologist sweden-
borg and strindburg two who might
be called mystics poe whose eureka
did not aid me much in the path of
witchcraft nevertheless fascinated
me but the remaining five were as
gold to me cagliostro court magi-
cian of france madame blavatsky
the priestess of isis and of the occult
doctrine dracula- with all its vam-
pires flammarions atmosphere
with its diagnosis of the gods of peo-
ples and de rochas of whom all i
can say is to quote from august
strindburgs the inferno the follow-
ing i do not excuse myself and
only ask the reader to remember this
fact in case he should ever feel in-
clined to practise magic especially
those forms of it called wizardry or
more properly witchcraft that its
reality has been placed beyond all
doubt by de rochas

  truly my friend i wondered for
i had good reason to do so what man-
ner of man had resided here before
my coming who should be so fasci-

nated by poe orfilo strindburg and
de rochas-four different types of
authors fog or no fog i determined
to find out there is not another
dwelling near here and the nearest
source of information is a village
some miles away this is rather odd
for this moor does not seem an unde-
sirable place for a summer home i
stored the books away and after in-
forming my valet of my intentions to
walk some miles to the village i start-
ed out i had not gone far when
leon decided to accompany me leav-
ing mortimer alone in the fog-sur-
rounded house

  leon and i established very little
in the town after a conversation
with one of the grocers in the village
the only communicative person that
we accosted we found that the man
who had last occupied the house was
a baronet lohrville it seemed that
the people held the late baronet in
awe for they hesitated to speak of
him this grocer related a tale con-
cerning the disappearance of four
girls one dark night some years ago
popular belief had and still has it
that the baronet kidnaped them this
idea seems utterly ludicrous to me
for the superstitious villagers can not
substantiate their suspicions by the
way this merchant also informed us
that the lohrville home is called the
bats belfry personally i can
see no connection between the resi-
dence and the ascribed title as i have
not noticed any bats around during
my sojourn here

  my meditations on this matter were
rudely interrupted by mortimer who
complained of bats in the cellar-a
rather queer coincidence he said
that he continually felt them brush-
ing against his cheeks and that he
feared they would become entangled
in his hair of course leon and i
went down to look for them but we
could not see any of them however
leon stated that one struck him
which i doubt it is just possible that

sudden drafts of air may have been
the cause of the delusions

  this incident marc was just the
forerunner of the odd things that
have been occurring since then i am
about to enumerate the most impor-
tant of these incidents to you and i
hope you will be able to explain them

  three days ago activities started in
earnest at that date mortimer came
to me and breathlessly informed me
that no light could be kept in the cel-
lar leon and i investigated and
found that under no circumstances
could a lamp or match be kept lit in
the cellar just as mortimer had said
my only explanation of this is that it
is due to the air currents in the cellar
which seem disturbed it is true a
flashlight could be kept alight but
even that seemed dimmed i can not
attempt to explain the later fact

  yesterday leon who is a devout
catholic took a few drops from a
flask of holy water which he contin-
ually carries with him and descended
into the cellar with the firm intention
of driving out if there were therein
cnsconced any evil spirits on the
bottom of the steps i noticed some
time ago a large stone tablet as
leon came down the steps a large
drop of the blessed fluid fell on this
tablet the drop of water actually
sizzled while leon muttered some in-
cantations in the midst of which he
suddenly stopped and fled precipi-
tantly mumbling that the cellar was
incontestably the very entrance to
hell guarded by the fiend incarnate
himself i confcss to you my dear
marc that i was astounded at this
remarkable occurrence

  last nght while the three of us
sat together in the spacious drawing
room of this building the lamp was
blown out i say blown out be-
cause there is no doubt that it was
and by some superhuman agency
thore was not a breath of air stirring
outside yet i who was sitting just
across from the lamp felt a cool

draft no one else noticed this draft
it was just as if someone directly op-
posite me had blown forcibly at the
lamp or as if the wing of a powerful
bird had passed by it

  there can be no doubt there is
something radically wrong in this
house and i am determined to find
out what it is regardless of conse-
quences

  here tlve letter terminates abrupt-
ly as if it were to he completed at a
later date

the two doctors bending over the
body of sir harry barclay in
lohrville manor at last ceased their
examinations

  i can not account for this as-
tounding loss of blood dr mor-
daunt  

  neither can i dr greene he
is so devoid of blood that some super-
natural agency must have kept him
alive he laughed lightly

  about this loss of blood-i was
figuring on internal hemorrhages as
the cause but there are absolutely no
signs of anything of the sort ac-
cording to the expression of his fea-
tures which is too horrible for even

me to gaze at-

 and me

 - he died from some terrible

fear of something or else he wit-
nessed some horrifying scene

  most likely the latter

  i think we had better pronounce
death due to internal hemorrhage and
apoplexy  

  i agree

  then we shall do so

  the physicians bent over the open
book on the table suddenly dr
greene straightened up and his hand
delved into his pocket and came out
with a match

  here is a match dr mordaunt
scratch it and apply the flame to that
book and say nothing to anyone
it is for the best


weird tales

excerpts from the journal of sir
harry e barclay found beside
his body in lolirvule manor on july
 

  june -last night i had a curi-
ous nightmare i dreamed that i met
a beautiful girl in the wood around
my fathers castle in lancaster with-
out knowing why we embraced our
lips meeting and remaining in that
position for at least half an hour
queer dream that i must have had
another nightmare of a different na-
ture although i can not recall it for
upon looking in the mirror this morn-
ing i found my face devoid of all
color-rather drawn

  later-leon has told me that he
had a similar dream and as he is a
confirmed misogynist i can not inter-
pret it strange that it should be so
parallel to mine in every way

 june -mortimer came to me
early this morning and said he would
not stay another instant for he had
certainly seen a ghost last night a
handsome old man he said he seemed
horrified that the old man had kissed
him he must have dreamed it i
persuaded him to stay on these
grounds and solemnly told him to say
nothing about it leon remarked
that the dream had returned in every
particular to him the preceding night
and that he was not feeling well i
advised him to see a doctor but he
roundly refused to do so he said
referring to the horrible nightmare
as he termed it that tonight he
would sprinkle a few drops of holy
water on himself and that he stated
would drive away any evil influence
if there were any connected with his
dreams strange that he should at-
tribute everything to evil entities

  later-i made some inquiries to-
day and i find that the description of
the baronet lohrville fits to every de-
tail the ghost of mortimers dream
i also learned that several small chil-
dren disappeared from the country-

side during the life of the last of the
lohrvilles-not that they should be
connected but it seems the ignorant
people ascribe their vanishing to the
baronet

  june -leon claims he did not
have the dream which by the way
revisited me last night because of
the potent effect of the holy water

 july -mortimer has left he
says he can not live in the same house
with the devil it seems he must have
actually seen the ghost of old lohr-
ville although leon scoffs at the idea

 july -i had the same dream
again last night i felt very ill this
morning but was able to dispel the
feeling easily during the day leon
has used all the holy water but as to-
morrow is sunday he will get some at
the village parish when he attends
mass

  july -i tried to procure the serv-
ices of another chef this morning in
the village but i am all at sea no
one in the town will enter the house
not even for one hundred pounds a
week they declare i shall be forced
to get along without one or send to
london

  leon experienced a misfortune to-
day riding home after mass his
holy water spilled almost all from the
bottle and later the bottle containing
the remainder of it fell to the ground
and broke leon nonplussed re-
marked that he would get another as
soon as possible from the parish
priest

  july -both of us had the dream
again last night i feel rather weak
and leon does too leon went to a
doctor who asked him whether he had
been cut or severely injured so as to
cause a heavy loss of blood or if he
had suffered from internal hemor-
rhages leon said no and the doctor
prescribed raw onions and some other
things for leon to eat leon forgot
his holy water

 july -the dream again leon
had a different nightmare-about an
old man who he said bit him i
asked him to show me where the man
had bitten him in his dream and
when he loosened his collar to show
me sure enough there were two tiny
punctures on his throat he and i
are both feeling miserably weak

  july -leon left me today i am
firmly convinced that he went sud-
denly mad for this morning he
evinced an intense desire to invade
the cellar again he said that some-
thing seemed to draw him i did not
stop him and some time later as i
was engrossed in a volume of wells
he came shrieking up the cellar steps
and dashed madly through the room
in which i sat i ran after him and
cornering him in his room forcibly
detained him i asked for an expla-
nation and all he could do was moan
over and over

  mon dieu monsieur leave this
accursed place at once leave it
monsieur i beg of you le diable

-le diable at this he dashed

away from me and ran at top speed
from the house i after him in the
road i shouted after him and all i
could catch of the words wafted back
to me by the wind were lamais

-le diable-mon dieu-tablet

-book of thoth all very signif-
icant words le diable and mon
dieu-the devil and my god
-i paid little attention to but la-
mais was a species of female vampire
known intimately to a few sclect sor-
cerers only and the book of thoth
was the egyptian book of magic for
a few minutes i entertained the rath-
er wild fancy that the book of thoth
was ensconced somewhere in this
building and as i racked my brains
for a suitable connection between
tablet and book of thoth i at last
became convinced that the book lay
beneath the tablet at the foot of the
cellar steps i am going down to in-
vestigate

fuly -i have it the book of
j thoth it was below the stone
tablet as i thought the spirits guard-
ing it evidently did not wish me to
disturb its resting place for they
roused the air currents to a sem-
blance of a gale while i worked to get
the stone away the book is secured
by a heavy lock of antique pattern

  i had the dream again last night
but in addition i could almost swear
that i saw the ghosts of old lohrville
and four beautiful girls what a co-
incidence i am very weak today
hardly able to walk around there
is no doubt that this house is infested
not by bats but by vampires lamais
if i could only find their corpses i
would drive sharp stakes through
them

  later-i made a new and shocking
discovery today i went down to the
place where the tablet lay and an-
other rock below the cavity wherein
the book of thoth had lain gave way
below me and i found myself in a
vault with about a score of skeletons
-all of little children if this house
is inhabited by vampires it is only
too obvious that these skeletons are
those of their unfortunate victims
however i firmly believe that there
is another cavern somewhere below
wherein the bodies of the vampires
are hidden

  later-i have been looking over the
book by de rochas and i have hit
upon an excellent plan to discover
the bodies of the vampires i shall
use the book of thoth to summon the
vampires before me and force them to
reveal the hiding place for their vo-
luptuous bodies de rochas says that
it can be done

  nine oclock-as the conditions are
excellent at this time  am going to
start to summon the vampires some-
one is passing and i hope ho or she
does not interrupt me in my work or
tell anyone in the town to look in
here the book as i mentioned be-
fore is secured by a heavy seal and


weird tales

i had trouble to loosen it at last i
succeeded in breaking it and i opened
the book to find the place i need in
my work of conjuring up the vam-
pires i found it and i am beginning
my incantations the atmosphere in
the room is changing slowly and it is
becoming intolerably dark the air
currents in the room are swirling an-
grily and the lamp has gone out 
i am confident that the vampires will
appear soon

  i am correct there are some
shades materializing in the room
they are becoming more distinct 
there are five of them four females
and one male their features are very
distinct    they are casting covert
glances in my direction    now
they are glaring malevolently at me

  good god i have forgotten to
place myself in a magic circle and i
greatly fear the vampires will attack
me i am only too correct they are
moving in my direction my god
 but stay they are halting
the old baronet is gazing at me with
his glittering eyes fiery with hate the
four female vampires smile voluptu-
ously upon me

  now if ever is my chance to break
their evil spell prayer but i can
not pray i am forever banished
from the sight of god for calling
upon satan to aid me but even for

that i can not pray  i am hyp-
notized by the malefic leer disfiguring
the countenance of the baronet there
is a sinister gleam in the eyes of the
four beautiful ghouls they glide to-
ward me arms outstretched their
sinuous obnoxious forms are before
me their crimson lips curved in a
diabolically triumphant smile i can
not bear to see the soft caiess of their
tongues on their red lips i am re-
sisting with all the power of my will
but what is one mere will against an
infernal horde of ghouls

  god their foul presence taints
my very soul the baronet is moving
forward his mordaeious propinqui-
ty casts a reviling sensation of ob-
scenity about me if i can not appeal
to god i must implore satan to grant
me time to construct the magic circle

  i can not tolerate their virulence
 i endeavored to rise but i could
not do so  i am no longer master
of my own will the vampires are
leering demoniacally at me  i am
doomed to die  and yet to live
forever in the ranks of the undead

  their faces are approaching closer
to mine and soon i shall sink into ob-
livion  but anything is better
than this  to see the malignant
undead around me  a sharp
stinging sensation in my throat

had mourned paul duval as
dead until there came that mys-
terious voice from out of the in-
infinite

  in my study is a radio receiver of
more than ordinary workmanship
not a set for amusement only but
a scientifically accurate instrument
like most fans i liked to amuse
myself by picking up distant stations
one night as i idly turned the dials
i noticed the tubes grow brighter as
certain markings on the dial were
passed i opened the cabinet and
peered into it everything seemed

to be in its proper position then
as i let the cover drop the tubes be-
gan to glow with a brilliancy which
grew until it exceeded that of the elec-
tric lights in the room

  something shorted i thought
as my hand approached the instru-
ment with the intention of shutting-
off the batteries then something
happened which caused me to draw
back my hand as though it had been
stung

  i must have sensed that no earthly
station was coming through perhaps
it was because the first word called

                                  


weird tales

was my name perhaps it was because
the tones that cried out from the
ether were filled with a quality of
sound which could come from no
earthly source faint vibrant but
clear came a voice

  harry help help harry for
gods sake help me i am-

  the words cut off in a volume of
sound unearthly squeals and cries
my hand darted to the dial but as i
touched it the lights resumed their
former brilliancy and i could hear
nothing

  unnerved and exhausted i sank
back into my chair the voice had
been that of paul duval-from the
other side he had called on me his
best friend to help him and-god
in heaven-i was helpless

 how long i sat i do not know
dimly i remember i heard the tele-
phone ring and heard janisch my
man answer it

  the first part of the conversation
made no impression on me then he
said well yes reluctantly dr
chaptel is here but he has left in-
structions not to be called   a pause
oh this is bairds sanitarium
very well ill see if hell speak to
you

  janisch did not eall me though
hardly were the last words out of his
mouth when i snatched the receiver
from his hand bairds was where
duvals body was confined

 yes yes what is it i de-
manded impatiently

 is this dr chaptel came a
voice

  it is what do you want

  dr baird asked me to tell you
paul duval has overpowered his
guard and escaped

  are you sure i queried faintly

  the reply left no doubt the at-
tendant had heard a persistent tap-
ping in duvals cell after a time
thinking it strange he had opened the
door to investigate only to have the
body bear him down in a moment

before the man could collect his wits
duval had somehow managed to es-
cape the guard could not be blamed
for the patient had never shown any
signs of violence and was consequent-
ly rated as harmlessly insane

  what are you doing about it

  we have a party of attendants
looking for him and have notified the
police as soon as we hear anything
well let you know

a word of explanation is due those
who are not familiar with the
weird experiment which duval suc-
cessfully performed he had discov-
ered a ray which made the disem-
bodied spirit bodies visible into the
influence of this ray had come mar-
guerite a girl he had loved but who
had died seeing her there beautiful
angel-like in the light of the beam
he had become possessed of an irre-
sistible longing to be with her she
had stretched her arms out to him

  down the path of the ray he had
gone to meet her he reached the
phantom shape into her arms he
had been clasped she kissed him
and duvals body slumped to the
floor a moment later i saw his soul
arise from his body and walk arm
in arm through the screen by which
marguerite had come into the great
beyond

  but duval was not dead when i
had shut off the power and rushed to
his side i found his body alive the
soul the intelligent part of his being
had gone from his body but that
body continued to breathe and other-
wise perform the functions of life
what remained was mere unintelli-
gent clay animated by the spark of
life it was duvals body but not
duval the part that was the real
paul did not inhabit its fleshly dwell-
ing that dwelling that part which
was left was what men term an idiot

  do you wonder at my surprize that
this body had suddenly become ani-
mated that it should attack a man
queen of the vortex



when for several years it had even
to be fed  for five years i had con-
fined it in bairds sanitarium diag-
nosed as having a progressively de-
teriorating dementia and now-

expecting a sleepless night i final-
ly went to bed in spite of ex-
pectations however sleep overtook
me broken by dreams vague but ter-
rible perhaps duvals escape com-
ing so closely upon the voice had
filled my mind with half-formed hor-
rors or it may have been my sub-
conscious reactions to the presenti-
ments which weighed upon my con-
scious mind perhaps without know-
ing it i was being prepared for what
was to follow

  i awoke with a start i knew i
had been dreaming but i knew it
had not been a dream which awak-
ened me for a moment i did not
know what it was moonlight was
flooding the room nothing seemed
amiss

  then i saw it perhaps a slight
creaking of the door had disturbed
my slumbers it was slowly swinging
inward i watched it fascinated it
opened wider a head was thrust into
the room the hair on it was wildly
awry there was a bloody scratch
down one cheek the eyes had a
fixed a set look like those in the head
of a dead man but they were not
sightless for they rested on me for
a moment with a gaze that sent quiv-
ering fright through my body then
the mouth widened in a terrible leer

  with this the fetters which bound
me fell away and i started to my
feet with the suddenness of a mis-
sile launched from a catapult the
body followed the head into the room
with a terrific leap which sprawled
me back on the bed i tried to fight
the thing off with my hands but fin-
gers of dreadful power caught my
wrists holding them fast

  as the grotesquely twisted face was
thrust into mine i saw it was du-

vals but how changed from the
old duval i noticed the creature
even as it held me seemed trying to
say something-to reassure me but
the vocal cords refused to form the
words and the result was an unintelli-
gible mumble

  duval seemed to realize at last
that i could not understand an
awful despair came into his face the
fingers tightened until it seemed my
wrist bones would shatter under the
pressure then the features relaxed
and i was drawn to my feet

  powerless to resist i was half car-
ried half dragged to the living room
he threw me heavily into a chair and
turned away as an automaton he
approached my radio and threw in
the switch the tubes grew bright
he carefully fixed the dials in a cer-
tain position without a word or ges-
ture of warning he dropped to the
floor instantly the light in the
tubes grew brighter and a voice came
from the set

  its all right harry duvals
voice again i had to get in com-
munication with you some way and
couldnt chance waiting for you ac-
cidentally to set the dials again
but - but where are you i
asked inanely

on the other side he answered
with a tinge of bitterness in his voice
well why are you - how did

- i began a hundred questions

at once swirling in my brain clamor-
ing for utterance

  dont make me explain now old
man i am in danger subject at any
moment to attack from a force of
which you have not the faintest con-
ception i want to return to life to
get back to my body which god help
me i left but powerful influences
are at work to keep me back harry
i can get back only with your help
will you give it

  but-but why dont you rejoin
your body you were in it just
now


weird tales

  not ih it harry just animating
it witli a very imperfect control
but dont waste time i am not in
rapport with the second cycle now
but may be at any moment in other
words i am not observed now when
i am i shall have to stop this last
significantly

  go ahead then i was begin-
ning to recover my mental stability
somewhat by now had i known
what was in store i should not have
told him ttf go ahead so boldly

  listen then get the old appa-
ratus set it up the best you can
you may do this from my notes if
you can unscramble them set it up
in this room i can get you through
this set if you need anything ex-
plained with the ray operating and
with your help i believe i can get
back

  get this carefully success may
depend on it communication through
the radio must not be disturbed so
do not touch it a slight movement
will throw it out of tune and what-
ever you do-

  the voice stopped was drowned
out by an infernal screeching from
the receiver then his voice again

  dont change the dials harry
dont change the dials my god i
believe they are taking me to the
vortex dont change the dials-
and watch my body dont change-
a-a-a-a-ahhh--

  the despairing words changed to
a hellish scream which drowned
thought a sound behind me i
turned in time to dodge a blow from
the again-animated body of duval
he did not attempt it again but
started toward the radio with the evi-
dent intention of doing something to
it with duvals last words ringing
in my ears the idea came to me that
he least of all would wish the set
interfered with the thought came to
me it was not duval in control this
time with the thought came action
i leaped at the body i crumpled it

to the floor just as the hands would
have touched the instrument janisch
came in answer to my frantic cries
and together we succeeded in over-
coming the man who did not seem to
have the strength he had when i was
attacked

  as soon as we had subdued it the
body relaxed and was again the su-
pine inert mass of flesh which for five
years had been the only earthly part
of duval

  then the warning from the set
came a new voice beautiful in its con-
tralto cadences sinister in its blood-
chilling tones

  do not meddle in this mortal
beware what you do i tasmari
queen of the vortex sister of bari
who is ruler of the second cycle
have spoken

several days passed yet no voice
came from the radio duvals
body remained inert and i passed the
time in feverish anxiety not daring
to leave the set unguarded for fear
some malignant entity might control
the body of duval and wreck the in-
strument beyond all hope of further
communication i had watched it con-
tinually snatching such sleep as i
could in the room with the set plac-
ing janisch on guard when physical
exhaustion drove me to rest

  but i had not been idle all of
duvals apparatus had been brought
to my study and with the aid of his
old note-books i had begun the task
of re-assembling the projectors i
knew i must get it together whether
i could or not i did not know

  it might be well here to recall the
principle which duval had discov-
ered beginning with the known
facts that matter and energy are in-
destructible he reasoned that intelli-
gence was something apart from
either a force which could not be de-
stroyed in its nature if the hypoth-
esis it could not be destroyed were
correct it must retain its character as
queen of the vortex



intelligence and hence have a definite
entity

  experiments had led him to believe
the soul was of a definite composition
too tenuous for the eye of man to be-
hold he reasoned further that could
he but make all the known rays of
light visible to the eye the total re-
flection from this unknown substance
would render the soul perceptible

  his experiments had carried him
farther and farther until at last he
had achieved success with the aid
of his wonderful ray and a screen
against which he projected it he was
able finally to bring actual disem-
bodied entities into view as long as
they remained in the path of the ray
and in front of the screen

  the rest has been recorded what
he had done what had happened to
him beyond the pale i had never
known now he was calling on me to
bring him back i wanted to succeed
to help but i was fearful fearful
of something maybe a prescience of
future terror maybe of admission we
were delving into that of which no
man should enquire

nphe day had come i oked upon
the machine assembled from the
notes duval had left time after
time i had come upon obstacles which
it seemed i could not surmount
again and again i had called upon
duval to instruct me i was half mad
at times but the voice had not come
again and the silence mocked me

  you may imagine with what feel-
ings with what fears i at last threw
in the switch which controlled the
projectors janisch whom i had
taken into my confidence stood be-
side me would disembodied spirits
be seen once more in the pale light of
the ray  would marguerite be there
-duval  a thin trickle of perspira-
tion rolled down my forehead on to
my cheeks i found myself clenching
my fists tightly my eyes were held
to the screen

  gradually the ray gained in inten-
sity the luminous screen seemed to
spring into greater brightness my
eyes strained for the first sight of the
little pinpoints of light which would
herald the materialization of spirits
my ears were attuned for the first
faint bell-like sound such as had an-
nounced the advent of marguerite

  the screen was a riotous thing of
color light and shadow

  then as a meteor appears piercing
the atmospheric envelope of the earth
the first tiny pinpoint appeared a
few more-then more it was hap-
pening as it had happened that night
when duval had materialized mar-
guerite the points of light would
arrange themselves into definite out-
lines soon and i would be assured
the first step for duvals rescue had
been successfully taken i watched
eagerly

 my god what was that the
little bells seemed ringing as before
but with a difference they did not
ring in musical cadences they were
harsh discordant a horror to the
ears and the little points of light
as fast as they appeared now they
were extinguished those which had
come first died one by one died
that is the word the impression
surged over me they were being
killed i felt as though they were
living things being put to death by
the agency of some malignant power
a strange conflict of some sort was
waging

  desperately i switched in more
power and was rewarded for a mo-
ment by seeing the little lights come
faster than they died but the
ascendancy was only for a moment
soon they were all gone all quenched
with the same deadly method

  i was stunned failure i turned
trembling from the screen and
reached for the controls a sharp
exclamation from janisch brought my
eyes back to the screen the light
and shadow played upon it as before


weird tales

but there was something else there
something fearful janiseh groaned
in fright

  within the beam there had grown
an awful shape-awful in the sense
of impressive power it gave from
its shadowy face brilliant eyes bored
into my soul they fastened them-
selves on my brain i was going my
very ego was being tom from the
body it inhabited came a brilliant
flash momentary darkness and the
sense of being borne through space
immeasurable with the speed of a
fleeting comet

  my eyes were tightly closed until
i became aware of a terrific light
shining in my face slowly i unclosed
my lids what i saw would have un-
seated my reason had such a thing
been possible i was peering through
a sort of doorway which had a fa-
miliar appearance to me i recog-
nized it as the framework of the
screen but i was on the reverse side
the beam was projected toward me
while near the controls to one side of
the machine i saw janiseh hysteri-
cally working over a prone figure
which i knew at once to be mine

  i leaped up dashed back into the
screen crying

  janiseh janiseh dont turn off
the ray im coming back i tried
to act as i had spoken but a wave of
irresistible force drew me back and
my last sight was a glimpse of jan-
ischs startled face as he looked in my
direction

  i gazed wildly about me but could
see nothing except the vague golden
light which covered everything a
feeling of utter helplessness swept
over me what could i do where
could i go

  with an effort i obtained control
over myself i had been let in for
something i knew not what and i
suspected it would not be pleasant
but better to meet it resolutely than
bound in the fetters of fear

  i shouted in answer came a rip-
ple of low mocking laughter seem-
ing to come from nowhere she ap-
peared it was distinct now to my
sight the figure i had vaguely seen
in the beam the eyes were no longer
terrible though they were cold and
chilled as the arctic snows they
were set in a forehead of flawless
beauty a pale and noble forehead
correctly proportioned and flawless
nose slightly tinted cheeks and de-
liciously curved lips her figure was
beautiful and devoid of clothing-
enough to make the red blood flow
swiftly through the veins of any man
but on me at that time she produced
not the slightest emotion other than
that of admiration for her beauty in
this plane fleshly instincts do not
exist

  as i gazed at her in wonder the

lips curved into a cool smile and she
said

  you were told not to meddle

mortal

  where am i i asked choosing
to disregard her statement

  in the second cycle

  and you 

 i am tasmari she replied
haughtily

  tasmari the owner of the warn-
ing voice went through my mind
and i stepped backward somewhat
hastily she noticed my movement
and smiled at me with contempt that
smile made me ashamed of myself
somehow and more-it caused a hot
resentment to pass over me who
was she spirit angel or demon to
assume an air of superiority to me
i was also a free spirit fear dropped
from me and from that time on i
do not believe i felt it-at least not
fear of the powers of the second
cycle though there is nothing repre-
hensible in fearing bari and tasmari
and the tremendous power they con-
trol

  then tasmari where is paul du-
val i shot at her
queen of the vortex



where you can not reach him
then you are going to tell me
where he is and how to reach him
i angrily cried as i stepped threaten-
ingly toward her

  stay where you are command-
ingly

tell me where duval is or ill

- i stopped tasmaris face

grew terrible with anger and once
again those eyes found mine i sud-
denly felt weak and ill i was held
immovable in some power she
seemed to be receding from me pres-
sure was exerted on me from every
direction strange sensations pulsed
over me in waves then her lips
parted once more in a mocking smile
and the pain left me she seemed
near me again in her former position

  know harry chaptel that such
as you may not threaten the queen
of the vortex that was but a small
sample of the awful power i wield
have you learned a lesson   

  i did not reply but i cast my eyes
to the ground not caring to give her
another opportunity to use her weap-
ons against me

  ah you fear me that is good
-and safe she sneered

  no i do not fear you the an-
gry cloud began to form on her face
again and i set myself to resist her
but her face cleared

    better that you did but remem-
ber this harry chaptel i charge you
to communicate with no other until
you have been before the council
beware of speaking to others

  with that she was gone leaving
me to stare rather stupidly at the spot
where she had stood i understood
later in this place where all is
thought that the entities are where
they will themselves to be had i
known it i could have brought my-
self into the presence of tasmari
again by the mere act of concentrat-
ing my thought upon her but i did
not know it and besides i had no
wish to see her again

up to now i had had no opportu-
nity to look about me i cast my
eyes around and was disappointed
there was nothing anywhere except
the golden light i have mentioned
no streets of gold no angel choirs
nothing which we are told may be
expected on the other side where
were the wonderful mansions  i
tried to picture in my mind just what
i had expected to see

  in the distance there now appeared
a wondrous city high-walled and
many-towered it reared itself in
splendor before my sight from out
its gates a resplendent host was pour-
ing while from the direction of the
city came the sound of beautiful mu-
sic angel voices as the rays of the
setting sun send streamers of light
upward into the clouds so did the
walls and towers shoot a glory of
radiance interminably into the vast-
ness above the scene the glory of
heaven as i had pictured it unfolded
itself to me

  never believing the stories of ac-
cepted belief concerning heaven i
had nevertheless considered them
beautiful in spite of unbelief of
agnosticism there are these pictures
in the mind of every man they are
drawn by the imagination and are
a part of us whether we realize it or
not

  since duval had proved the exist-
ence of the ego after death these
thoughts had been much plainer i
had often speculated on what the
other side would be like and ma-
tured intellect could not banish the
pictures placed in my mind during
my childhood years

  then here was the city of gold
its hosts of angels archangels ser-
aphim and cherubim pouring from
its jeweled gates encircling its ma-
jestic towers

  but the angel faces grew suddenly
dim and the eternal city vanished
from before me a sullen red cloud
grew in its place and instead of the


weird tales

singing i now heard the screechings
of the damned brilliant flashes of
jagged flame rent the cloud and there
burst upon me a hellish horde

  they gibbered and screamed with
a hate i could feel they were evil
the army of satan shouldering its
way through the horrible throng came
a hideous monster who looked at me
with evil triumph it was the same
that had preceded marguerite in the
ray on the first night of duvals ex-
periment it was the soul of a de-
generate murderer she had informed
duval as i remembered this it
came to me that each of the horrors
i was beholding was the soul of some-
one who had previously existed in
life the evil they had let into their
souls had made monsters of them
was this to be my fate

  they pressed closer upon me sin
and evil emanated from them in reek-
ing soul-scorching blasts i felt my-
self filled with unholy thoughts terri-
ble desires only with an effort did
i withstand the almost irresistible
temptation to partake of their sinful
debaucheries to join with them in
sinfulness they surrounded me on
every side

  my god my god i cried is
there no one to helpme

  at the sound of the name they
fell back as in fear thrusting out
their hands as if to ward off a blow
they stayed thus for perhaps a
hearts beat then came swarming
back to me again not to be denied
this time they beat me down with the
evil of their thought they confused
me with a maelstrom of horrible de-
sires sent from their beings to mine
i was about to perish my soul was
to lose itself in the hideousness of sin

  penetrating the babel about me
came the sound of tiny bronze bells
the monsters ceased their efforts to-
ward me and looked uneasily about
the sound became plainer and its
music fell upon my tortured soul with
the divine blessedness of a prayer

the circle opened outward and
through it came marguerite the
monsters retired hastily but did not
depart gathered in the distance
they watched sullenly

though i should have felt a grate-
fulness toward my rescuer i
found instead that my being was
filled with resentment throughout
the years that had passed since the
night duval had left i had always
cherished within my heart a sort of
hatred for this woman - a hatred
born of the fact that it was she who
had tempted paul beyond the pale
now i felt my own troubles were due
in a large measure to her i should
not have treated her as i did how-
ever and i offer no excuses except-
well i was not entirely free from the
evil which had just encompassed me

  when i saw the monsters had with-
drawn i looked into marguerites
face she met my eyes with a smile
and i returned it with a look of sul-
len hatred

  so you are marguerite i be-
gan

  yes she replied simply per-
plexed at my attitude

  have you come here to see the fin-
ish of the deviltry you began five
years agof i asked harshly

  to see-why i came here to help
you

  i laughed unbelievingly

  besides haughtily the devil-
try as you call it began with the
mad desire of paul to see what should
have remained hidden from him

  so that is your excuse i flared
i suppose you blame him because
you enticed him into this place   she
made no reply to this but bowed her
head

 why dont you answer me no
reason to ask you-you-satan
was there ever a creature so despi-
cable at the sound of the name
of the prince of darkness marguer-
queen of the vortex



ite shuddered as if with fear and the
horde came leaping closer

  stop she cried there is-

  i wont stop you listen to me
i flared i know i cant hurt you
here but i can tell you what you are
a fiend out of hell a traitress
the betrayer of the man who loved
you knowing he loved you you
used your devilish witchery to lure
him here having him here you de-
sert him you should be cast into the
nethermost pit of hell i screamed-
at each angry word the horde had
crept closer and closer

  no more she commanded coldly
would you engulf yourself again in
the power of sin hatred has no
place here-except among these she
gestured toward the monsters

  seeing them again so close i
forced myself to be more calm i did
not want them howling around me
again

  just the same i have spoken my
thoughts i averred unconsciously
using a term true in life but out of
place in the second cycle where all
is thought

  then i shall say to you the
truth she replied i have never
deserted paul duval you make ac-
cusations which you can not know are
true which are not true how little
you know

  i have helped him helped though
it placed me in danger of the vortex
if bari or tasmari knew a hundredth
part of what i have done i should
not be here some day they will
burst through my isolation and learn
the truth even now tasmari seeks
the one who tried to meet you at the
ray

  oh if it were only myself to be
considered i would isolate myself
from you with a barrier so strong
that a thousand wills could not break
it

  i wish you would i retorted
leave me to get paul out of this
and i dont care what you do

  and if i do will you free him
she asked a questioning smile on her
lips

  i wiu try

  and how will you do it do you
know where he is

  here she had me i didnt have
the slightest idea as to how to pro-
ceed to free paul it suddenly oc-
curred to me i might have to have
help i looked at her more closely
than i had done before she was
beautiful beyond a doubt

  so scornfully he does not
know what to do yet he would drive
away the only being in the second
cycle who is willing to help

   you help   i queried how can
you help   

  i am one of the council

  that means nothing to me if
you are willing to help why havent
you done so  

  i have but for me paul could
never have gotten through to you i
tried to meet you first but tasmari
interfered and her power is so much
greater than mine i can not help
paul more because he has set his
mind against help from me
why suspiciously

  he loves me

  paul still loved her after what she
had done after she had brought
him to this plane if he loved her
why did he want to return seem-
ing to read me she burst out impetu-
ously 

 ah cant you understand
taking paul through was such a little
thing it seemed when i came here
time it doesnt exist in the second
cycle so what matters it if a being
comes here early or late it must
come sometime i did not know his
coming would not be like mine leav-
ing all desires of life behind

  paul is unhappy knowing he
can do so much good in fife to keep
so many from becoming as these
pointing to the horde which was
again in the distance he wants to


weird tales

return other souls have wanted to
go back but they can not but paul
-his body lives on he has the op-
portunity

 it suddenly came to me that i
should like to return for the same
reason i had come to realize my own
life had been spent searching in the
wrong channel that i should have
used my knowledge to bring about a
better humanity sickness and pov-
erty beget evil and evil made up the
horde

  cant we be friends and work to-
gether softly

  a feeling of tenderness and love
welled up within me the shutters
had fallen from my eyes and i was
at last fit to be with marguerite to
work with her

  yes i replied i glanced in tri-
umph toward the horde but they had
disappeared

  gone she volunteered noticing
my look of surprize they existed
only because your thoughts called
them up thought is all in the sec-
ond cycle

  the golden city i asked
  your thought also

  then they were not real

    thought is the only reality there
is she answered enigmatically

marguerite and i stood before
paul duval instructed by her
i had concentrated my thought on
him and had found myself almost at
once in his presence he was clothed
as i had last seen him for in the sec-
ond cycle the beings are dressed as
the eye of the beholder consciously
or subconsciously sees them that he
should be clothed as i last saw him
was natural

  he was suspended motionless a lit-
tle above the plain on which we stood
he did not seem to see me or to be
aware of my presence it was not
until i spoke to him and he did not
answer that i saw something was
amiss

  he seemed encompassed in a clear
amber substance the nature of whieh
i do not to this day really know i
stretched forth my hand to touch
him but the substance prevented it
at the same instant duvals body
seemed to be covered with a myriad
of tiny golden flames they flickered
weirdly over him but did not seem to
possess the quality of heat i with-
drew my hand and the flames sub-
sided i tried it again and the fin-
gers of fire flared up again but
brighter and somewhat angrily

  oh dont dont try to touch
him cried the girl

  why i asked stupidly

  cant you see he is isolated
  isolated

  yes tasmari isolated him for
trying to communicate with you
they she and bari feared he might
get back to the first cycle-life
why does this bari want to keep
him here

  that bari knows best paul has
been purified by the thought coun-
cil when that has occurred the
soul is subject to bari and bari holds
what he has  

  this reminded me of what tasmari
had commanded she had told me to
speak to no one until i had been puri-
fied by this thought council so
that was her plan after the coun-
cil had done its work i could be held
as was duval and neither of us could
go back she was afraid i would
learn too much

  tasmari has commanded me to
speak to no one i stated what
would happen if she found me speak-
ing to you

  she would first force you before
the council after they would do
with you as they wished or as he
wished he is supreme they might
send you to the vortex

  duval had shrieked something
about being carried to the vortex
when he had talked with me over the
radio a sudden idea came to me
queen of the vortex



  is that the vortex motioning
to paul

  no thank god it isnt the vor-
tex is-a horror it is a maelstrom
of punishing thoughts there is no
return for the soul cast in it is a
seething whirlpool of tempestuous
sin it drags you down and down and
at last shatters the very entity which
is you it is death the real death
after that there is nothing  

  there may be a third cycle i
hazarded

  her face brightened

   that is what some of us think if
there were we should not fear bari
so

  if there were how like our own
life always the fear of the unknown
one veil torn aside and another be-
fore us impenetrable did things go
on and on or was there an end a
stopping place was there at last a
heaven surely a god  maybe the in-
scrutable would unwind itself may-
be- but why speculate my work
was to get paul duval and myself
back to life again

  what power holds paul

  the only one there is the power
of thought

  if that is the case why cant we
get paul out of there

  you could i could but it would
mean punishment if i were cauht
i have wanted to so much but paul
made me promise i wouldnt try and
has focused his thought against help
from me he has a strong will
do you fear the vortex i
asked with a shade of scorn bred of
my ignorance

   yes  candidly   but that would
not stop me from helping him if i
should break down the isolation there
is no place to go and he would simply
be put back into it again and my
usefulness would end

  could they put me in the-vor-
tex

  i do not know what your status
is maybe they could

  could tasmari

  only if the council has the power
and then only by its authority
here goes for a try anyhow i
exclaimed touching once more the
mantle about paul

  if you touch him you will only
injure him and warn tasmari what
you are about you must concentrate
your thought on him entwine your
being with his bythinking you may
be too weak and be drawn in with

him be careful of-

  but i did not hear the rest i was
already doing as she had instructed
i was putting my whole being into
the thought that paul duval was a
free soul unhampered by any bar-
rier once more by my side

  at first it did not seem as though
i were accomplishing anything then
i saw one of his fingers move hope
aroused i set myself more sternly to
the task his eyes opened and he
saw me then his arm lifted a feel-
ing of joy surged through me but
it was short-lived

  i was now opposed by some force
some opposing power was grappling
with my will and at its thrust i felt
myself growing weaker pauls arm
fell to his side once more and his eyes
closed i was slowly brought nearer
to him i was being drawn in
also

  the thought terrified me and at
that instant i knew myself to be
within the barrier the little flames
were licking at me now as they had
licked at paul when i attempted to
touch him in the last effort i sent
every erg of will-power remaining in
me crashing against the force which
was overpowering me

  it was of no avail things seemed
afar off now and i knew a peace
which was greater than i had ever
thought possible a gray mist gath-
ered before me suddenly it was dis-
sipated by a bright flash the force
i had been fighting left and paul and
i were together


weird tales

  i looked for marguerite but she
was not to be seen somehow i felt
it was through her aid i had won

complete silence was around us
made more profound by the ces-
sation of duvals voice in some
manner we were being protected from
tasmari i felt this rather than knew
it and duval had taken advantage
of the respite to tell me of conditions
in the second cycle speech is not
necessary there but possible and it
was more satisfactory to hear the
sound of our voices

  it is strange yet entirely logical
this story of the second cycle as
duval told it in a time past it had
been found necessaiy to form the
egos of the second cycle into some
sort of organization with so many
entities each with a freedom and
power of will inconceivable to one
yet in life the cycle had been a ver-
itable chaos

  it was finally decided to give one
intelligence supreme power how the
selection was made is a mystery  but
the lot had fallen to bari he had
once been the ruler of a civilization
mightier than ours and so ancient as
to have been lost in the records of
time in so far as those living were
concerned

  conscious and subconscious thought
is a part of each intelligent being so
to give bari authority which could be
enforced without the possibility of re-
sistance the egos of the second cycle
concentrated their subconscious
thought on bari this was possible
because in this plane each entity has
full control of the elements which
compose his being the result was a
force composed of the mass subcon-
sciousness of the whole

  having obtained the supreme au-
thority which could have been taken
away from him at any time by the
co-ordinated agreement of the intelli-
gences giving it bari made his posi-

tion impregnable by forming the
thought council

  it consists of a carefully selected
number of the strongest wills favor-
able to him and his policies they
exert their conscious will-power in
unison with that of bari on the sub-
conscious wills of the whole thus
the council and therefore bari is
absolute for the conscious will con-
trols the subconscious absolutely by
the power of suggestion in a meas-
ure the entire spirit body of the sec-
ond cycle is controlled by bari much
as a hypnotized person is controlled
by the hypnotist there are points
of difference to be sure but unex-
plainable to one in life a rebel of
the council is easily beaten down by
the subconsciousness of the whole
which bari controls in himself it is
a sort of vicious circle

  as each newcomer arrives he is
brought before the council and there
compelled to give allegiance to bari
this means the newly arrived intel-
ligence before he knows what it is
all about is asked to unite his sub-
consciousness with the mass subcon-
ciousness of the cycle on rare occa-
sions when this is refused obedience
is compelled after purification so
called the new one is a part of it
all able to do nothing without the
knowledge of the rest in other
words each unit is in constant rap-
port with the cycle the only relief
from this is the individual isolation
barrier each intelligence is able de-
pending upon his strength of will to
build about him and this can be
broken down if enough will-power is
exerted against it

  baris one weakness is real though
remote it may happen another in-
telligence may become strong enough
to gather others to him with this
nucleus an organization might form
which could hold the old one off long
enough to gain strength to attack it
theie are many beings in the second
cycle who would fly to a new stand-
queen of the vortex



ard should one appear strong enough
to aid them in again controlling their
own subconsciousness now if one
breaks away he is beaten in detail
the thing is a sort of divide et im-
pera

  this is where duval had fallen out
with bari coming to the cycle as
he did there remained a body to
which he could return under proper
conditions there was nothing about
it to unfit it for duvals fixture use
since death had never occurred
death would of course make the
body untenable therefore bari
feared that should duval return to
life he might obtain enough followers
to unseat the present ruler when all
should have crossed over to the other
side

  in spite of every obstacle which bari
and tasmari placed before duval he
had managed to partly free himself at
times from the cycle with the aid of
marguerite  this was done by the
two of them erecting a thought bar-
rier against the cycle marguerite
had risked all in aiding him and an
unsteadiness crept into duvals voice
as he mentioned her poor loyal lit-
tle soul his life in the cycle had
been happy with her in a way we do
not understand since sex as we know
it does not exist there is nothing
base about it but it is more the union
of positive and negative qualities
soul-satisfying and pure

  as for tasmari she was the real
sister of bari to whom he had given
a great deal of his power she was
of the council and queen of the vor-
tex

  duval could not tell me what the
vortex was he had never seen it
the thing was a mystery to those in
the second cycle as death is to those
in the first duval did not think
there was anything sinful about it
but thought it was merely the way
out he had never seen it but told
me that only through it could the soul
die he had risked it when he got

into communication with me a for-
bidden act

  well have to be getting out of
this he stated at last as soon as
i come into the thoughts of bari or
tasmari they will know i am out of
isolation and be down upon us
what shall we do

  is the ray operating

  it was when i left

  it had better be now he re-
marked dryly if it isnt we are
both in for it it had not entered
into my calculation you would come
over by the way as a sudden
thought struck him why did you
come   

  i told him how it had happened

  tasmaris doings he exclaimed
clever too dont you see by get-
ting you here she thinks she can keep
both of us thinks i need help from
the life side well i did we both
do if the ray has been shut off you
werent touched by it were you
no

  then i am not so sure she can
hold you at all i think your case is
one similar to suspended animation
i believe you can return when you
will it in my case i left by the ray
and must return through its agency
just why i dont know it must dis-
tend the molecules of my flesh i
know i cant will myself into it for
i tried tasmari took advantage of
your concentration on the ray mo-
mentarily to break your hold  your
body and bring you through

  how could she do that

  dont waste time talking men
in the orient have separated their
astral bodies from the flesh for thou-
sands of years but come he com-
manded we havent time to lose
ive taken up too much already tell-
ing about things but thought you
should know what you are up against

  listen carefully harry you
must think yourself back at the
screen at that moment our isolation
barrier will break down and well


weird tales

have to work fast to build another
when we get to the sereen but as
soon as we are there believe with all
your mind that bari and tasmari can
not reach us do you get the idea

  i nodded

  when i say three be at the
screen one two three

it sounds almost humorous to relate
this now but i can assure you
there was nothing funny about it
then at the word three i found
myself in exactly the posture i had
been still looking at duval but the
projectors were throwing their rays
toward us i was furiously concen-
trating to raise a barrier against bari
and tasmari

  thank god for the ray and for the
faithfulness of janisch who had kept
this gateway open to us we could
go back the second cycle had
waited too long before striking

  then from the room carried to us
on the ray came the sound of a loud
thumping voices were raised dim-
ly in the background i could see our
bodies and also that which startled
me to the roots of my being janisch
was desperately trying to barricade
the door of the laboratory which was
giving inward to violent attacks from
without

  a voice was calling open in the
name of the law another voice
which i recognized as bairds cried
out i tell you there is something
wrong in there officer break in the
door

  an instant later the door was
quivering again from lusty blows
rained on it should they get in be-
fore i could recover my body there
was no foretelling what might hap-
pen even though i could get back
the projectors might be damaged by
the intruders and that would leave
duval a captive janisch could never
account for our bodies was success
to be snatched from us at this last
moment 

  the same thought occurred to us
both at the same instant we sprang
together for the screen we won
through into the room but only for
a breath something stopped us it
was as though we had flung ourselves
into a tremendously heavy gale we
could attempt forward progress con-
tinue to move as though forward but
instead of gaining ground we were
losing it

    what is it   i yelled at duval

   bari  he gasped the difference
of the second we had paused to look
into the room had been our undoing
bari had become aware of our escape
and had instantly launched his fear-
ful power to draw us back i glanced
at the place where janisch struggled
to keep the door closed my eyes re-
turned to where paul had been but
he had vanished the next instant i
was carried back and before i real-
ized what had taken place i found
myself again by the side of paul look-
ing into the face of one whom i knew
instantly to be bari his eyes were
fixed on mine coldly stern in their
expression and it took a mighty ef-
fort of will on my part to look away
from them

  gathered about him every face
turned to his were at least a thou-
sand souls tasmari among them i
knew the throng for what it was the
council of thought theirs were the
wills which had broken down our iso-
lation barrier and drawn us hurtling
back into the presence of the ruler
of the second cycle our situation
was desperate confronted with a
mighty force the projectors endan-
gered by baird we were indeed in
a hopeless position if we were to
get back to the screen before the in-
vaders broke into the laboratory we
should have to act quickly and action
seemed impossible

  i looked questioningly at paul but
his face gave me no hope an expres-
sion of resigned despair had settled
queen op the vortex



there which deepened when bari
spoke

  have done he ordered at the
command the faces of the council
turned away from his and fastened
on ours

  instantly i felt the lessened tension
and a new hope was born in me which
did not die even when bari seeming
to read my thought said bari
alone can hold you now i had re-
membered what paul had said about
my case being similar to that of sus-
pended animation in that case bari
and his council could not prevent my
returning no matter what happened
to duval once on the life side i
might be able to help paul again

  bari can not hold me i ven-
tured desperately determined to bluff
it as long as possible a frown ap-
peared on his face not of anger but
of perplexity he was not sure my
hope grew stronger doubt in his
mind was strength in mine to hold
me he had to believe he could if i
could shake that belief-

  you have broken the laws of the
second cycle he charged

  i have never been under the law

  no but as an alien to the cycle
you are subject to commands given
you by the council these you have
flaunted

  the council has given me no com-
mands 

  you have broken one command
deny it if you dare  came hotly from
tasmari baris face brightened per-
ceptibly

  what command sister he quer-
ied softly

    in the name of the council i
commanded him to speak to no one
until he had been before the coun-
cil she replied with a triumphant
glance at me

  then i hold you fast he re-
joined and may pass sentence upon
you

  i failed to see where the breaking
of this command made me susceptible

to the laws of the cycle and felt he
was trying to weaken my belief as i
was trying to weaken his and be-
sides- then it came to me and

i took a malicious delight in making
my next statement for i felt it would
hurt tasmari

  still you can not hold me even
if i had received a command in the
name of the council you could not
hold me but i have never received
such an order  

 you dare dispute my word
challenged tasmari angrily

  i dare tell the truth you said
i charge you to communicate with
no other yju gave it in your own
name not in the name of the coun-
cil of course turning to bari in
mock humility if tasmari rules the

council or if the council-

 enough thundered bari we
admit you have broken no command
of the council you may return but
you will forget all you have seen or
heard while in the cycle now you
turning to duval have broken our
laws again and again you are an
incorrigible rebel i sentence you to
the vortex

  a gasp came from paul i shall
never want to see a spirit shaken as
was his at that moment his entire
being quivered at the words

  is there no reprieve he slowly
asked at last

  none and the sentence shall be
carried out at once stay with us and
see a spirit racked in the vortex he
invited me mockingly

  i groaned inwardly not only did
i want to be spared the ordeal but
time was against me even now
rough hands might be destroying the
projectors but there was no hope
for it i had to go

a s baei spoke the entire scene
changed we had seemed to be
in a stately hall during this period of
our trial now it vanished and a
broad level plain took its place it


weird tales

ended abruptly in a sharp precipice
we proceeded to its very edge be-
low a gray mist was swirling which
seemed to sigh as it rapidly changed
in contour little flashes of blue
light intermingled with the gray
while the entire mass whirled rapidly
toward a funnel-shaped center the
vortex

  duval looked over the edge the
throng stepped back away from him
leaving him alone the focal point of
all eyes he turned and flashed a
melancholy smile at me which he
tried to make seem cheerful

  this is the end old man you
did your best to help me he
sighed my own fault anyway
better hurry back while you may
the time has been short and the ray
in all probability is still opening the
way good-bye

  my god paul i cant leave
you i cried

  there is no hope then as i
still hesitated he cried harshly
get out of here you fool get out
here goes and he crouched for his
spring over the edge i turned my
head there was a sound as a whis-
per which ran through the multitude
i looked back and saw duval was no
longer on the edge of the chasm

  no he was running back from it
while in front of bari was the slight
figure of a woman-marguerite she
was speaking

  you shall not send him in bari

  by what do you question the sen-
tence

  by the power of my will bari
drew back from her in outraged maj-
esty and surprize

  you dare oppose it to-to mine
he stammered

  yes to yours and the whole coun-
cil she answered defiantly

  well if you must have it here

- grated bari bending those

eyes terrible with the power they con-
trolled upon her but she did not
wilt as i expected she remained

erect before him duval was beside
me

 come harry its our only
chance he cried

  and leave her- wondering-

ly i had not thought paul duval
capable of deserting one who had
helped him especially when that one
was in danger

  yes you fool-

  but the vortex

  is not for her she is one of the
council

  waiting to hear no more we again
threw our wills to the screen and
only just in time the door of the
laboratory fell in as i dashed down
the path of the beam locating my
body i concentrated every thought
on the one idea that i was in it the
next instant i was rewarded by feel-
ing it around me i tried to rise but
for a moment the gross flesh would
not obey my commands then i
staggered to my feet

  duval was within the ray dancing
about like a madman he tried to
come into the room but was able to
go no farther than the confines of the
ray there was the sound of many
feet running across the room a sick-
ening smash and a cry from janisch
told me he had been struck down by
our well-meaning but dangerous
friends then the beam faded rap-
idly someone had shut off the
power

  paul was fading out with the beam
i saw him leave then heard his voice
over the radio which had not been
disturbed thank god in a voice he
tried to make calm but which was
filled with mortal anxiety he cried
  turn on the power put my body
in the beam quick harry quick
bari has broken marguerite they
are beginning to pull me back

  in one jump i had thrown in the
power knocking baird down as he
tried to stop me with a strength i
did not dream of possessing i carried
pauls body and threw it within the
queen of the vortex



path of the ray he appeared in-
stantly and fell on his body for a
moment he seemed to lie on top then
slowly sank into the flesh

  his soul had barely disappeared
when tasmari raged into sight with-
out a seconds hesitation she also fell
on the body duvals intelligence be-
gan to reappear on his body corus-
cations like molten gold showed for an
instant and faded the figure writhed
as though in torment once again the
soul of duval penetrated his flesh
outlining it now there grew an aura
of blinding iridescence combining
every color of the spectrum the
weirdness of this struggle of two be-
ings for one body appalled me

  suddenly it was ended about the
body the aura faded succeeding it
came a myriad of little pinpoint
lights they grew in number and
swarmed away where they whirled
confusedly in the light of the ray
then they gradually began to assume
the outlines of a figure was it paul
or tasmari  materialization came

more rapidly and i caught a glimpse
of a slender arm it was tasmari
who was leaving paul had won

  without more ado i shut off the
power as the beam faded these
words came to me in the faintest of
whispers

  you win this time but in the end
you must return the last glow
faded and tasmari was gone

in a few words i explained or tried
to explain the situation to baird
who thought janisch had murdered
both duval and me duval had the
appearance of one dead but i knew
that when three days had passed he
would regain tiis senses we had
been successful still i was de-
pressed

  trying to place what vaguely trou-
bled me it came to me

  marguerite how had she fared at
the hands of bari god bless the
staunch and loyal little soul and
duval  had he sacrificed her to save
himself 

the previous adventures of duval telling how he invented his strange
machine and how he ventured into the second cycle were told

by h b marry at

my father was not born
or originally a resident in
the ilartz mountains he
was the serf of a hungarian noble-
man of great possessions in tran-
sylvania but although a serf he
was not by any means a poor or illit-
erate man in fact he wtas rich
and his intelligence and respectabil-
ity were such that he had been raised
by his lord to the stewardship but
whoever may happen to be born a
serf a serf he must remain even
though he become a wealthy man
such was the condition of my father
my father had been married for about
five years and by his marriage had
three children - my eldest brother
casar myself hermann and a
sister named marcella

  my mother was a very beautiful
woman unfortunately more beautiful
than virtuous she was seen and ad-
mired by the lord of the soil my
father was sent away upon some mis-
sion and during his absence my
mother flattered by the attentions
and won by the assiduities of this
nobleman yielded to his wishes it
so happened that my father returned
very unexpectedly and discovered
the intrigue the evidence of my
mothers shame was positive he sur-
prized her in the company of her
seducer carried away by the im-
petuosity of his feelings he watched
the opportunity of a meeting taking
place between them and murdered
both his wife and her seducer con-
scious that as a serf not even the
provocation which he had received


would be allowed as a justification of
his conduct he hastily collected to-
gether what money he could lay his
hands on and as we avere then in the
depth of winter he put his horses to
the sleigh and taking his children
with him he set off in the middle of
the night and was far away before
the tragical circumstance had become
known aware that he would be pur-
sued and that he had no chance of
escape if he remained in any portion
of his native country in which the
authorities could lay hold of him
he continued his flight without inter-
mission until he had buried himself
in the intricacies and seclusion of the
hartz mountains

  of course all that i have now told
you i learned afterward my oldest
recollections are knit to a rude yet
comfortable cottage in which i lived
with my father brother and sister
it was on the confines of one of those
vast forests which covcr the northern
part of germany around it were a
few acres of ground which during
the summer months my father culti-
vated and which though they yield-
ed a doubtful harvest wtere sufficient
for our support in the winter we
remained much indoors for as my
father followed the chase we were
left alone and the wolves during
that season incessantly prowled
about my father had purchased the
cottage and land about it of one of
the rude foresters who gain their
livelihood partly by hunting and
partly by burning chareoal for the
purpose of smelting the ore from the
the werewolf



neighboring mines it was distant
about two miles from any other habi-
tation i can call to mind the whole
landscape now the tall pines which
rose up on the mountain above us
and the wide expanse of forest be-
neath on the topmost boughs and
heads of whose trees we looked down
from our cottage as the mountain be-
low us rapidly descended into the dis-
tant valley in summertime the pros-
pect was beautiful but during the
severe winter a more desolate scene
could not well be imagined

  i said that in the winter my father
occupied himself with the chase
every day he left us and often would
he lock the door that we might not
leave the cottage he had no one to
assist him or to take care of us-in-
deed it was not easy to find a female
servant who would live in such a soli-
tude but could he have found one
my father would not have received
her for he had imbibed a horror of
the sex as the difference of his con-
duct toward us his two boys and my
poor little sister marcella evidently
proved you may suppose we were
sadly neglected indeed we suffered
much for my father fearful that we
might come to some harm would not
allow us fuel when he left the cottage
and we were obliged therefore to
creep under the heaps of bear-skins
and there to keep ourselves as warm
as we could until he returned in the
evening when a blazing fire was our
delight that my father chose this
restless sort of life may appear
strange but the fact was that he
could not remain quiet whether from
remorse for having committed mur-
der or from the misery consequent on
his change of situation or from both
combined he was never happy unless
he was in a state of activity chil-
dren however when left much to
themselves acquire a thoughtfulness
not common to their age so it was
with us and during the short cold
days of winter we would sit silent

longing for the happy hours when the
snow would melt and the leaves burst
out and the birds begin their songs
and when we should again be set at
liberty

  such was our peculiar and savage
sort of life until my brother caesar
was nine myself seven and my sister
five years old when the circumstances
occurred on which is based the ex-
traordinary narrative which i am
about to relate

one evening my father returned
home rather later than usual he
had been unsuccessful and as the
weather was very severe and many
feet of snow were upon the ground
he was not only very cold but in a
very bad humor  he had brought in
wood and we were all three of us
gladly assisting each other in blowing
on the embers to create the blaze
when he caught poor little marcella
by the arm and threw her aside the
child fell struck her mouth and bled
very much my brother ran to raise
her up accustomed to ill usage and
afraid of my father she did not dare
to cry but looked up in his face very
piteously my father drew his stool
nearer to the hearth muttered some-
thing in abuse of women and busied
himself with the fire which both my
brother and i had deserted when our
sister was so unkindly treated a
cheerful blaze was soon the result of
his exertions but we did not as
usual crowd round it marcella still
bleeding retired to a corner and my
brother and i took our seats beside
her while my father hung over the
fire gloomily and alone such had
been our position for about half an
hour when the howl of a wolf close
under the window of the cottage fell
on our ears my father started up
and seized his gun the howl was re-
peated he examined the priming and
then hastily left the cottage shutting
the door after him we all waited
anxiously listening for we thought


weird tales

that if he succeeded in shooting the
wolf he would return in a better
humor and although he was harsh to
all of us and particularly so to our
little sister still we loved our father
and loved to see him cheerful and
happy for what else had we to look
up to  and i may here observe that
perhaps there never were three chil-
dren who were fonder of each other
we did not like other children fight
and dispute together and if by
chance any disagreement did arise
between my elder brother and me lit-
tle marcella would run to us and
kissing us both seal through her en-
treaties the peace between us mar-
cella was a lovely amiable child i
can recall her beautiful features even
now alas poor little marcella

  we waited for some time but the
report of the gun did not reach us
and my elder brother then said our
father has followed the wolf and will
not be back for some time marcella
let us wash the blood from your
mouth and then we will leave this
corner and go to the fire and warm
ourselves

  we did so and remained there un-
til near midnight every minute won-
dering as it grew later why our
father did not return we had no
idea that he was in any danger but
we thought that he must have chased
the wolf for a very long time

  i will look out and see if father is
coming said my brother csesar go-
ing to the door

  take care said marcella the
wolves must be about now and we
can not kill them brother

  my brother opened the door very
cautiously and but a few inches he
peeped out i see nothing said
he after a time and once more he
joined us at the fire

  we have had no supper said i
for my father usually cooked the meat
as soon as he came home and during
his absence we had nothing but the
fragments of the preceding day

 and if our father comes home
after his hunt csesar said marcella
he will be pleased to have some sup-
per let us cook it for him and for
ourselves

  caesar climbed upon the stool and
reached down some meat - i forget
now whether it was venison or bears
meat but we cut off the usual quan-
tity and proceeded to dress it as we
used to do under our fathers superin-
tendence we were all busied putting
it into the platters before the fire to
await his coming when we heard the
sound of a horn we listened-there
was a noise outside and a minute
afterward my father entered usher-
ing in a young female and a large
dark man ija a hunters dress

perhaps i had better now relate
what was only known to me many
years afterward when my father
had left the cottage he perceived a
large white wolf about thirty yards
from him as soon as the animal saw
my father it retreated slowly growl-
ing and snarling my father followed
the animal did not run but always
kept at some distance and my father
did not like to fire until he was pretty
certain that his ball would take ef-
fect thus they went on for some
time the wolf now leaving my father
far behind and then stopping and
snarling defiance at him and then
again on his approach setting off at
speed

  anxious to shoot the animal for
the white wolf is very rare my
father continued the pursuit for sev-
eral hours during which he continu-
ally ascended the mountain

  you must know that there are pe-
culiar spots on those mountains which
are supposed and as my story will
prove truly supposed to be inhabited
by the evil influences they are well
known to the huntsmen who invari-
ably avoid them now one of these
spots an open space in the pine for-
ests above us had been pointed out
the werewolf



to my fathet as dangerous on that
account  but whether he disbelieved
these wild stories or whether in his
eager pursuit of the chase he disre-
garded them i know not certain
however it is that he was decoyed by
the white wolf to this open space
when the animal appeared to slacken
her speed my father approached
came close- up to her raised his gun
to his shoulder and was about to fire
when the wolf suddenly disappeared
he thought that the snow on the
ground must have dazzled his sight
and he let down his gun to look for
the beast-but she was gone how she
could have escaped over the clearance
without his seeing her was beyond his
comprehension mortified at the ill
success of his chase he was about to
retrace his steps when he heard the
distant sound of a horn astonish-
ment at such a sound-at such an hour
-in such a wilderness made him for-
get for the moment his disappoint-
ment and he remained riveted to the
spot in a minute the horn was blown
a second time and at no great dis-
tance my father stood still and lis-
tened a third time it was blown i
forget the term used to express it
but it was the signal which my father
well knew implied that the party was
lost in the woods in a few minutes
more my father beheld a man on
horseback with a female seated on
the crupper enter the cleared space
and ride up to him at first my
father called to mind the strange sto-
ries which he had heard of the super-
natural beings who were said to fre-
quent these mountains but the nearer
approach of the parties satisfied him
that they were mortals like himself

  as soon as they came up to him the
man who guided the horse accosted
him friend hunter you are out
late the better fortune for us we
have ridden far and are in fear of
our lives which are eagerly sought
after these mountains have enabled
us to elude our pursuers but if we

find not shelter and refreshment that
will avail us little as we must perish
from hunger and the inclemency of
the night my daughter who rides
behind me is now more dead than
alive-say can you assist us in our
difficulty

  my cottage is some few miles dis-
tant replied my father but i have
little to offer you besides a shelter
from the weather to the little i have
you are welcome may i ask whence
you come

  yes friend it is no secret now
we have escaped from transylvania
where my daughters honor and my
life were equally in jeopardy

  this information was quite enough
to raise an interest in my fathers
heart he remembered his own es-
cape he remembered the loss of his
wifes honor and the tragedy by
which it was wound up he immedi-
ately and warmly offered all the as-
sistance which he could afford them

  there is no time to be lost then
good sir observed the horseman
my daughter is chilled with the
frost and can not hold out much
longer against the severity of the
weather

  follow me replied my father
leading the way toward home

  i was lured away in pursuit of a
large white wolf observed my fath-
er it came to the veiy window of
my hut or i should not have been out
at this time of night  

  the creature passed by us just as
we came out of the wood said the
female in a silvery tone

  i was nearly discharging my piece
at it observed the hunter but
since it did us such good service i am
glad that i allowed it to escape

in about an hour and a half during
which my father walked at a rapid
paee the party arrived at the cottage
and as i said before came in

  we are in good time apparent-
ly observed the dark hunter catch-


weird tales

ing the smell of the roasted meat as
he walked to the fire and surveyed my
brother and sister and myself you
have young cooks here mynheer he
said

  i am glad that we shall not have
to wait replied my father come
mistress seat yourself by the fire
you require warmth after your cold
ride

  and where can i put my horse
mynheer observed the huntsman

  i will take care of him replied
my father going out of the cottage
door

  the female must however be par-
ticularly described she was young
and apparently twenty years of age
she was dressed in a traveling dress
deeply bordered with white fur and
wore a cap of white ermine on her
head her features were very beau-
tiful at least i thought so and so
my father has since declared her
hair was flaxen glossy and shining
and bright as a mirror and her
mouth although somewhat large when
it was open showed the most brilliant
teeth i have ever beheld but there
was something about her eyes bright
as they were which made us children
afraid they were so restless so fur-
tive i could not at that time tell
why but i felt as if there was cruelty
in her eye and when she beckoned
us to come to her we approached her
with fear and trembling still she
was beautiful very beautiful she
spoke kindly to my brother and my-
self patted our heads and caressed
us but marcella would not come near
her on the contrary she slunk away
and hid herself in the bed and would
not wait for the supper which half
an hour before she had been so anx-
ious for

  my father having put the horse
into a close shed soon returned and
supper was placed upon the table
when it was over my father re-
quested that the young lady would
take possession of his bed and he

would remain at the fire and sit up
with her father after some hesita-
tion on her part this arrangement
was agreed to and i and my brother
crept into the other bed with mar-
cella for we had as yet always slept
together

  but we could not sleep there was
something so unusual not only in see-
ing strange people but in having
those people sleep at the cottage that
we were bewildered as for poor lit-
tle marcella she was quiet but i per-
ceived that she trembled during the
whole night and sometimes i thought
that she was checking a sob my
father had brought out some spirits
which he rarely used and he and the
strange hunter remained drinking
and talking before the fire our ears
were ready to catch the slightest
whisper-so much was our curiosity
excited

  you said you came from tran-
sylvania observed my father

  even so mynheer replied the
hunter i was a serf to the noble
house of- my master would in-
sist upon my surrendering up my fair
girl to his wishes it ended in my giv-
ing him a few inches of my hunting
knife 

  we are countrymen and brothers
in misfortune replied my father
taking the huntsmans hand and
pressing it warmly

  indeed are you then from that
country   

  yes and i too have fled for my
life but mine is a melancholy tale

     your name    inquired the hunter

  krantz

 what krantz of- i have

heard your tale you need not renew
your grief by repeating it now wel-
come most welcome mynheer and i
may say my worthy kinsman i am
your second cousin wilfred of bams-
dorf cried the hunter rising up and
embracing my father

  they filled their horn mugs to the
brim and drank to one another after
the werewolf



the german fashion the conversa-
tion was then carried on in a low
tone all that we could collect from
it was that our new relative and his
daughter were to take up their abode
in our cottage at least for the pres-
ent in about an hour they both fell
back in their chairs and appeared to
sleep

  marcella dear did you hear
said my brother in a low tone

  yes replied marcella in a whis-
per i heard all oh brother i
can not bear to look upon that woman
-i feel so frightened  

 my brother made no reply and
shortly afterward we were all three
fast asleep

when we awoke the next morning
we found that the hunters
daughter had arisen before us i
thought she looked more beautiful
than ever she came up to marcella
and caressed her the child burst into
teais and sobbed as if her heart
would break

  but not to detain you with too long
a story the huntsman and his daugh-
ter were accommodated in the cottage
my father and he went out hunting
daily leaving christina with us she
performed all the household duties
was very kind to us children and
gradually the dislike even of little
marcella wore away but a great
change took place in my father he
appeared to have conquered his aver-
sion to the sex and was most atten-
tive to christina often after her
father and we were in bed would he
sit up with her conversing in a low
tone by the fire i ought to have
mentioned that my father and the
huntsman wilfred slept in another
portion of the cottage and that the
bed which he formerly occupied and
which was in the same room as ours
had been given up to the use of chris-
tina these visitors had been about
three weeks at the cottage when one
night after we children had been

sent to bed a consultation was held
my father had asked christina in
marriage and had obtained both her
own consent and that of wilfred
after this a conversation took place
which was as nearly as i can recol-
lect as follows

  you may take my child myn-
heer krantz and my blessing with
her and i shall then leave you and
seek some other habitation-it mat-
ters little where

  why not remain here wilfred
no no i am called elsewhere let
that suffice and ask no more ques-
tions you have my child

  i thank you for her and will duly
value her but there is one diffi-
culty

  i know what you would say
there is no priest here in this wild
country true neither is there any
law to bind still must some ceremony
pass between you to satisfy a father
will you consent to marry her after
my fashion if so i will marry you
directly  

  i will replied my father

    then take her by the hand now
myriheer swear

  i swear repeated my father
  by all the spirits of the hartz

mountains- 

  nay why not by heaven inter-
rupted my father

  because it is not my humor re-
joined wilfred if i prefer that
oath less binding perhaps than an-
other surely you will not thwart me
well be it so then have your
humor will you make me swear by
that in which i do not believe
yet many do so who in outward
appearance are christians rejoined
wilfred say will you be married
or shall i take my daughter away
with me

  proceed replied my father im-
patiently

  i swear by all the spirits of the
hartz mountains by all their power
for good or for evil that i take chris-


weird tales

tina for my wedded wife that i will
ever protect her cherish her and love
her that my hand shall never be
raised against her to harm her

  my father repeated the words after
wilfred

  and if i fail in this my vow
may all the vengeance of the spirits
fall upon me and upon my children
may they - perish by the vulture by
the wolf or other beasts of the forest
may their flesh be torn from their
limbs and their bones blanch in the
wilderness all this i swear  

  my father hesitated as he repeated
the last words little marcella could
not restrain herself and as my father
repeated the last sentence she burst
into tears this sudden interruption
appeared to discompose the party
particularly my father he spoke
harshly to the child who controlled
her sobs burying her face under the
bed-clothes

  such was the second marriage of
my father the next morning the
hunter wilfred mounted his horse
and rode away

  my father resumed his bed which
was in the same room as ours and
things went on much as before the
marriage except that our new step-
mother did not shof any kindness to-
ward us indeed during my fathers
absence she would often beat us par-
ticularly little marcella and her eyes
would flash fire as she looked eagerly
upon the fair and lovely child

one night my sister awoke me and
my brother

  what is the matter said cjesar

 she has gone out whispered
marcella

  gone out

  yes gone out at the door in her
night-clothes replied the child i
saw her get out of bed look at my
father to see if he slept and then she
went out at the door

  what could induce her to leave her
bed and all undressed to go out in

such bitter wintry weather with the
snow deep on the ground was to us
incomprehensible we lay awake and
in about an hour we heard the growl
of a wolf close under the window

  there is a wolf said caesar
she will be torn to pieces

  oh no cried marcella

  in a few minutes afterward our
stepmother appeared she was in her
night-dress as marcella had stated
she let down the latch of the door
so as to make no noise went to a pail
of water and washed her face and
hands and then slipped into the bed
where my father lay

  we all three trembled we hardly
knew why but we resolved to watch
the next night we did so-and not
only on the ensuing night but on
many others and always at about the
same hour would our stepmother rise
from her bed and leave the cottage-
and after she was gone we invariably
heard the growl of a wolf under our
window and always saw her on her
return wash herself before she re-
tired to bed we observed also that
she seldom sat down to meals and
that when she did she appeared to
eat with dislike  but when the meat
was taken down to be prepared for
dinner she would often furtively put
a raw piece into her mouth

  my brother cassar was a courage-
ous boy he did not like to speak to
my father until he knew more he
resolved that he would follow her out
and ascertain what she did marcella
and i endeavored to dissuade him
from this project but he would not
be controlled and the very next night
he lay down in his clothes and as
soon as our stepmother had left the
cottage he jumped up took down my
fathers gun and followed her

  you may imagine in what a state
of suspense marcella and i remained
during his absence after a few min-
utes we heard the report of a gun it
did not awaken my father and we lay
trembling with anxiety in a minute
the werewolf



afterward we saw our stepmother en-
ter the cottage-her dress was bloody
i put my hand to marcellas mouth
to prevent her crying out although
i was myself in great alarm our
stepmother approached my fathers
bed looked to see if he was asleep
and then went to the chimney and
blew up the embers into a blaze

  who is there said my father
waking up

  lie still dearest replied my
stepmother it is only me i have
lighted the fire to warm some water
i am not quite well

  my father turned round and was
soon asleep but we watched our step-
mother she changed her linen and
threw the garments she had worn into
the fire and we then perceived that
her right leg was bleeding profusely
as if from a gunshot wound she
bandaged it up and then dressing
herself remained before the fire until
the break of day

  poor little marcella her heart beat
quick as slie pressed me to her side-
so indeed did mine where was our
brother caesar how did my step-
mother receive the wound unless from
his gun  at last my father rose and
then for the first time i spoke say-
ing father where is my brother
caesar  

  your brother exclaimed he
why wheie can he be

  merciful heaven i thought as i
lay very restless last night observed
our stepmother that i heard some-
body open the latch of the door and
dear me husband what has become
of your gun   

  my father cast his eyes up above
the chimney and perceived that his
gun was missing for a moment he
looked perplexed then seizing a
broadax he went out of the cottage
without saying another word

  he did not remain away from us
long in a few minutes he returned
bearing in his arms the mangled body

of my poor brother he laid it down
and covered up his face

  my stepmother rose up and looked
at the body while marcella and i
threw ourselves by its side wailing
and sobbing bitterly

  go to bed again children said
she sharply husband continued
she your boy must have taken the
gun down to shoot a wolf and the
animal has been too powerful for him
poor boy he has paid dearly for
his rashness

  my father made no reply i wished
to speak - to tell all - but marcella
who perceived my intention held me
by the arm and looked at me so im-
ploringly that i desisted

  my father therefore was left in
his error but marcella and i al-
though we could not comprehend it
were conscious that our stepmother
was in some way connected with my
brothers death

  that day my father went out and
dug a grave and when he laid the
body in the earth he piled up stones
over it so that the wolves should not
be able to dig it up the shock of
this catastrophe was to my poor
father very severe for several days
he never went to the chase although
at times he would utter bitter ana-
themas and vengcanee against the
wolves

  but during this time of mourning
on his part my stepmothers noc-
turnal wanderings continued with the
same regularity as before

  at last my father took down his
gun to repair to the forest but he
soon returned and appeared much
annoyed

  would you believe it christina
that the wolves - perdition to the
whole race-have actually contrived
to dig up the body of my poor boy
and now there is nothing left of him
but his bones

  indeed replied my stepmother

marcella looked at me and i saw in

 


weird tales

her intelligent eye all she would have

uttered

  a wolf growls under our window
every night father said i

  aye indeed-why did you not
tell me boy -wake me the next time
you hear it

  i saw my stepmother turn away
her eyes flashed fire and she gnashed
her teeth

  my father went out again and cov-
ered up with a larger pile of stones
the little remnants of my poor brother
which the wolves had spared such
was the first act of the tragedy

the spring now came on the snow
disappeared and we were permit-
ted to leave the cottage but never
would i quit for one moment my
dear little sister to whom since the
death of my brother i was more
ardently attached than ever indeed
i was afraid to leave her alone with
my stepmother who appeared to have
a particular pleasure in ill-treating
the child my father was now em-
ployed upon his little farm and i was
able to render him some assistance

  marcella used to sit by us while we
were at work leaving my stepmother
alone in the cottage i ought to ob-
serve that as the spring advanced so
did my stepmother decrease her noc-
turnal rambles and we never heard
the growl of the wolf under the win-
dow after i had spoken of it to my
father

  one day when my father and i
were in the field marcella being with
us my stepmother came out saying
that she was going into the forest to
collect some herbs my father wanted
and that marcella must go to the cot-
tage and watch the dinner marcella
went and my stepmother soon disap-
peared in the forest taking a direc-
tion quite contrary to that in which
the cottage stood and leaving my
father and me as it were between
her and marcella

  about an hour afterward we were
startled by shrieks from the cottage
evidently the shrieks of little mar-
cella marcella has burned herself
father said i throwing down my
spade my father threw down his
and we both hastened to the cottage
before we could gain the door out
darted a large white wolf which fled
with the utmost celerity my father
had no weapon he rushed into the
cottage and there saw poor little
marcella expiring her body was
dreadfully mangled and the blood
pouring from it had formed a large
pool on the cottage floor my fathers
first intention had been to seize his
gun and pursue but he was checked
by this horrid spectacle he knelt
down by his dying child and burst
into tears marcella could just look
kindly on us for a few seconds and
then her eyes were closed in death

  my father and i were still hanging
over my poor sisters body when my
stepmother came in at the dreadful
sight she expressed much concern but
she did not appear to recoil from the
sight of blood as most women do

  poor child said she it must
have been that great white wolf which
passed me just now and frightened
me so-shes quite dead krantz

  i know it-i know it cried my
father in agony

i thought my father would never
recover from the effects of this sec-
ond tragedy he mourned bitterly over
the body of his sweet child and for
several days would not consign it to
its grave although frequently re-
quested by my stepmother to do so
at last he yielded and dug a grave
for her close by that of my poor
brother and took every precaution
that the wolves should not violate her
remains

  i was now really miserable as i
lay alone in the bed which i had for-
merly shared with my brother and
sister i could not help thinking that
the werewolf



my stepmother was implicated in both
their deaths although i could not ac-
count for the manner but i no longer
felt afraid of her my little heart was
full of hatred and revenge

  the night after my sister had been
buried as  i lay awake i perceived
my stepmother get up and go out of
the cottage i waited for some time
then dressed myself and looked out
through the door which i half
opened the moon shone bright and
i could see the spot where my brother
and my sister had been buried  and
what was my horror when i perceived
my stepmother busily removing the
stones from marcellas grave

  she was in her white night-dress
and the moon shone full upon her
she was digging with her hands and
throwing away the stones behind her
with all the ferocity of a wild beast
it was some time before i could col-
lect my senses and decide what to do
at last i perceived that she had ar-
rived at the body and raised it np to
the side of the grave i could bear it
no longer i ran to my father and
awoke him

  father father cried i dress
yourself and get your gun

  whatf cried my father the
wolves are there are they

  he jumped out of bed threw on
his clothes and in his anxiety did not
appear to perceive the absence of his
wife as soon as he was ready i
opened the door he went out and i
followed him

  imagine his horror when unpre-
pared as he was for such a sight he
beheld as he advanced toward the
grave not a wolf but his wife in her
night-dress on her hands and knees
crouching by the body of my sister
and tearing off large pieces of the
flesh and devouring them with all the
avidity of a wolf she was too busy
to be aware of our approach my
father dropped his gun his hair stood
on end so did mine he breathed
heavily and then his breath for a

time stopped i picked up the gun
and put it into his hand suddenly
he appeared as if concentrated rage
had restored him to double vigor he
leveled his piece fired and with a
loud shriek down fell the wretch
whom he had fostered in his bosom

  god of heaven cried my fath-
er sinking down upon the earth in a
swoon as soon as ho had discharged
his gun

  i remained some time by his side
before he recovered where am
i said he what has happened
-oh yes yes i recollect now
heaven forgive me

  he rose andwe walked up to the
grave what again was our astonish-
ment and horror to find that instead
of the dead body of my stepmother
as we expected there was lying over
the remains of my poor sister a large
white she-wolf

  the white wolf exclaimed my
father the white wolf which de-
coyed me into the forest-i see it all
now-i have dealt with the spirits of
the hartz mountains

  for some time my father remained
in silence and deep thought he then
carefully lifted up the body of my
sister replaced it in the grave and
covered it over as before having
struck the head of the dead animal
with the heel of his boot and raving
like a madman lie walked back to
the cottage shut the door and threw
himself on the bed i did the same
for i was in a stupor of amazement

    arly in the morning we were both
aroused by a loud knocking at
the door and in rushed the hunter
wilfred

  my daughter-man-my daugh-
ter-where is my daughter cried
he in a rage

  where the wretch the fiend
should be i trust replied my fath-
er starting up and displaying equal
choler where she should be - in

his ax and raised it over wilfreds

through the form of the hunter and
my father lost his balance and fell
heavily on the floor

then he thought his
mother replaced the
loosened covers and
tucked them in aboat
his shoulder

for the first year or there-
abouts after his scotch moth-
ers death the successful lawyer
alan carrington was conscious among
his other feelings of a kind of vague
dread that she might appear as a
character in one of his dreams as
she had often assured him her mother
had come to her being the man he
was he resented this feeling as an in-
congruity yet there was a certain
background for the feeling of dread
it had been one of his practical moth-
ers convictions that such an appear-
ance of her long-dead mother always
preceded a disaster in the family

  such aversions as he might possess
against the maternal side of his ances-
try were all included in his dislike for
belief in this kind of thing when he
agreed that the scotch are a dour
race he always had reference at

least mentally to this superstitious
strain associated with that race from
timg immemorial concrete to his ex-
perience because of this belief of his
mothers against which he had al-
ways fought

  he carried out dutifully and with
a high degree of professional skill all
her various expressed desires and
continued after her death to live in
their large comfortable house per-
haps because his mother never did ap-
pear in such dreams as he happened
to remember his dread became less
and less poignant at the end of two
years or so occupied with the throng-
ing interests of a public man in the
full power of his early maturity it
had almost ceased to be so much as a
memory

  in the spring of his forty-fourth
year carrington who had long

                                  


weird

tales

worked at high pressure and virtually
without vacations was apprized by
certain mental and physical indica-
tions which his physician interpreted
vigorously that he must take at least
the whole summer off and devote him-
self to recuperation rest said the
doctor for his overworked mind and
under-exercised body was impera-
tively indicated

  carrington was able to set his
nearly innumerable interests and af-
fairs in order in something like three
weeks by means of highly concen-
trated efforts to that end then ex-
ceedingly nervous and not a little de-
bilitated physically from this extra
strain upon his depleted resources he
had to meet the problem of where he
was to go and what he was to do he
was of course too deeply set in the
rut of his routines to find such a de-
cision easy fortunately this prob-
lem was solved for him by a letter
which he received unexpectedly from
one of his cousins on his mothers
side the reverend fergus macdon-
ald a gentleman with whom he had
had only slight contacts

  dr macdonald was a middle-aged
retired clergyman whom an immi-
nent decline had removed eight or ten
years before from a- brilliant if un-
derpaid career in his own profession
after a few years sojourn in the adi-
rondacks he had emerged cured and
with an already growing reputation
as a writer of that somewhat inelastic
literary product emphasized by cer-
tain american magazines which seem
to embalm a spinsterish austerity of
the literary form under the label of
distinction

  dr macdonald had retained a de-
veloped pastoral instinct which he
could no longer satisfy in the manage-
ment of a parish he was besides
too little robust to risk assuming at
least for some time to come the wear-
ing burden of teaching he compro-
mised the matter by establishing a
summer camp for boys in his still-

desirable adirondacks being devoid
of experience in business matters he
associated with himself a certain
thomas starkey a young man whom
the ravages of the white plague had
snatched away from a sales-manager-
ship and driven into the quasi-exile
of saranac where dr macdonald
had met him

  this association proved highly suc-
cessful for the half-dozen years that
it had lasted then starkey after a
brave battle for his health had suc-
cumbed just at a period when his
trained business intelligence would
have been most helpful to the affairs
of the camp

  dazed at this blow dr macdonald
had desisted from his labors after
literary distinction long enough to
write to his cousin carrington be-
seeching his legal and financial coun-
sel when carrington had read the
last of his cousins finished periods
he decided at once and dispatched a
telegram announcing his immediate
setting out for the camp his inten-
tion to remain through the summer
and the promise to assume full charge
of the business management he
started for the adirondacks the next
afternoon

  his presence brought immediate
order out of confusion dr macdon-
ald on the evening of the second day
of his cousins administration of af-
fairs got down on his knees and re-
turned thanks to his maker for the
undeserved beneficence which had
sent this financial angel of light into
the midst of his affairs in this his
hour of dire need thereafter the
reverend doctor immersed himself
more and more deeply in his wonted
task of producing the solid literature
dear to the hearts of his editors

  but if carringtons coming had im-
proved matters at the camp the bal-
ance of indebtedness was far from be-
ing one-sided for the first week or
so the reaction from his accustomed
way of life had caused him to feel if
across the gulf



anything even staler and more nerve-
racked than before but that first un-
pleasantness past the invigorating
air of the balsam-laden pine woods be-
gan to show its restorative effects rap-
idly he found that he was sleeping
like the dead he could not get
enough sleep it appeared his appe-
tite increased and he found that he
was putting on needed weight the
business management of a boys camp
absurdly simple after the complex
matters of big business with which
he had long been occupied was only
a spice to this new existence among
the deep shadows and sunny spaces
of the adirondack country at the
end of a month of this he confidently
declared himself a new man by the
first of august instead of the nervous
wreck who had arrived sharp-visaged
and cadaverous two months before
carrington presented the appearance
of a robust hard-muscled athlete of
thirty twenty-two pounds heavier
and without a nerve in his body

on the evening of the fourth day
of august healthily weary after
a long days hike carrington retired
soon after  oclock and fell imme-
diately into a deep and restful sleep
toward morning he dreamed of his
mother for the first time since her
death more than six years before his
dream took the form that he was ly-
ing here in his own bed awake-a
not altogether uncommon form of
dream-and that he was very chilly
in the region of the left shoulder as
is well-known to those skilled in the
scientific phenomena of the dream-
state now a very prominent portion
of the material used in psychological
study this kind of sensation in a
dream virtually always is the result
of an actual physical condition and
is reproduced in the dream because of
that actual background as a stimulus
carringtons cold shoulder was to-
ward the left-hand or outside of the

bed which stood against the wall of
his large airy room

  in his dream he thought that he
reached out his hand to replace the
bed clothes and as he did so his hand
was softly though firmly taken and
his mothers well-remembered voice
said   lie still laddie i  tuck you
in   then he thought his mother re-
placed the loosened covers and tucked
them in about his shoulder with her
competent touch he wanted to thank
her and as he could not see her be-
cause of the position in which he was
lying he endeavored to open his eyes
and turn over being in that state
commonly thought of as between sleep
and waking with some considerable
effort he succeeded in forcing open
his reluctant eyes but turning over
was a much more difficult matter it
appeared he had to fight against an
overpowering inclination to sink back
comfortably into the deep sleep from
which in his dream he had awakened
to find his shoulder disagreeably un-
comfortable the warmth of the re-
placed covers was an additional in-
ducement to sleep

  at last with a determined wrench
he overcame his desire to go to sleep
again and rolled over to his left side
by dint of a strong effort of his
will smiling gratefully and about to
express his thanks but at the in-
stant of accomplishing this victory of
the will he actually awakened in
precisely the position recorded in his
mind in the dream-state

  where he had expected to meet his
mothers eyes he saw nothing but
there remained with him a persistent
impression that he had felt the with-
drawal of her hand from where on
his shoulder it had rested caressingly
the grateful warmth of the bed-
clothes in that cool morning remained
however and he observed that they
were well tucked in about that
shoulder

  his dreamhad clearly been of the
type which george du maurier


weird tales

speaks of in peter ibbetson he had
dreamed true and it required sev-
eral minutes before he could rid him-
self of the impression that his mother
moved by some strange whimsicality
had stepped fcut of his sight perhaps
hidden herself behind the bed he
was actually about to look back of the
bed before the utter absurdity of the
idea became fully apparent to him
the back of the bed stood close
against the wall of the room his
mother had been dead more than six
years

  he jumped out of bed at the sound
of reveille blown by the camp bu-
gler and this abrupt action dissi-
pated his impressions their memory
remained however very clear-cut in
his mind for the next two days the
impression of his mothers nearness
in the course of that vivid dream had
recalled her to his mind with the
greatest clarity with this revived
impression of her too there marched
almost of necessity he supposed in
his mind the old idea which he had
dreaded-the idea that she would
come to him to warn him of some
impending danger

  curiously enough as he analyzed
his sensations he found that there re-
mained none of the old resentment
connected with this speculation such
as had characterized it during the
period immediately after his mothers
death his maturity the preoccupa-
tions of an exceptionally full and ac-
tive life and the tenderness which
marked all his memories of his mother
had served to remove from his mind
all traces of that idea the possibil-
ity of a warning in his dream of
his dear mother only caused him to
smile during those days after the
dream during which the revived im-
pression of his mother slowly faded
thin but it was the indulgent slight-
ly melancholy smile of a revived nos-
talgia a gentle faint sense of home-
sickness for her such as might aect
any middle-aged man recently re-

minded of a beloved mother in some

rather intense fashion

on the evening of the second day
after his dream he was walking
toward the camp garage with some
visitors a man and woman parents
of one of the boys at the camp in-
tending to drive with them to the vil-
lage to guide them in some minor pur-
chases just beside the well-worn
trail through the great pine trees
half-way up the hill to the garage the
woman noticed a clump of large
brownish mushrooms and enquired if
they were of an edible variety car-
rington picked one and examined it
to his limited knowledge it seemed
to have several of the marks of an
edible mushroom while they were
standing beside the place where the
mushrooms grew one of the younger
boys passed them

  crocker called mr carrington
yes mr carrington replied
young crocker pausing

  crocker your cabin is the one
farthest south isnt it

  yes sir

  were you going there just now
yes mr carrington can i do
anything for you

  well if it isnt too much trouble
you might take this mushroom over
to professor benjamins-you know
where his camp is just the other side
of the wire fence beyond your cabin
-and ask him to let us know whether
or not this is an edible mushroom
im not quite sure myself

  certainly replied the boy
pleased to be allowed out of bounds
even to the extent of the few rods
separating the camp property from
that of the gentleman named by car-
rington a university teacher regarded
locally as a great export on mush-
rooms fungi and suchlike things

  carrington called after the disap-
pearing boy

  oh crocker

  yes mr carrington
across the gulf



  throw it away if dr benjamin
says its no good but if he says its
all right bring it baek please and
leave it on the mantel-shelf in the big
living room do you mind   

  all right sir shouted crocker
over his shoulder and trotted on

returning from the village an
hour later carrington found the
mushroom on the mantel-shelf in the
living room

  he placed it in a large paper bag
left it in the kitchen in a safe place
and the next morning before break-
fast walked up the trail toward the
garage and filled his paper bag with
mushrooms

  he liked mushrooms and so doubt-
less did the people who had notieed
these he decided he would prepare
the mushrooms himself there would
be just about enough for three gen-
erous portions mushrooms were not
commonly eaten as a breakfast dish
but-this was camp 

 exchanging a pleasant good
morning with the young colored
man who served as assistant cook and
who was engaged in getting breakfast
ready and- smilingly declining his of-
fer to prepare the mushrooms he
peeled them warmed a generous lump
of fresh country butter in a large
frying pan and began cooking them
a delightfully appetizing odor aris-
ing from the pan provoked respectful
banter from the young cook amused
at the camp-directors efforts along
the lines of his own profession and
the two chatted while carrington
turned his mushrooms over and over
in the butter with a long fork when
they were done exactly to a turn and
duly peppered and salted carrington
left them in the pan which he took
off the stove and set about the prep-
aration of three canapes of fried
toast he was going to serve his
mushrooms in style as the grinning
young cook slyly remarked he
grinned back and divided the mush-

rooms into three equal portions each
on its cmutpe which he asked the un-
der-cook to keep hot in the oven dur-
ing the brief interval until mess call
should bring everybody at camp in to
breakfast

  then with his long fork he speared
several small pieces of mushroom
which had got broken in the pan
after blowing these cool on the fork
carrington grinning like a boy put
them into his mouth and began to eat
them

 good suh enquired the assist-
ant cook

  delicious mumbled carrington
enthusiastically his mouth full of the
succulent bits after he had swal-
lowed his mouthful he remarked

  but i must have left a bit of the
hide on one of em theres a little
trace of bitter

  look out for em suh  enjoined
the under-cook suddenly grave
theyre plumb wicked when they
aint jus right suh

  these are all right returned
carrington reassuringly i had
professor benjamin look them over

  he sauntered out on the veranda
waiting for the bugle call from
many directions the boys and a few
visitors were straggling in toward the
mess hall after a morning dip in the
lake and cabin inspection from their
room in the guest house the people
with whom he had been the evening
before came across the broad veranda
toward him he was just turning
toward them with a smile of pleasant
greeting when the very hand of death
fell on him

  without warning a sudden terrible
griping accompanied by a deadh
coldness and this immediately fol-
lowed by a pungent burning heat
ran through his body great beads
of sweat sprang out on his forehead
his knees began to give under him
everything all this pleasant world
about him of brilliant morning sun-
shine and deep sharply-defined shad-


weird tales

ow tamed greenish and dim his
senses started to slip away from him
in the numbness which closed down
like a relentless hand crushing out
his consciousness

  with an effort which seemed to
wrench his soul and tear him with un-
imagined pain he gathered all his
waning forces and sustained only by
a mighty effort of his powerful will
he staggered through the open door-
way of the mess hall into the kitchen
he nearly collapsed as he leaned
against the nearest table articulating
between fast-paralyzing lips

  water-and mustard quick
the mushrooms

  the head-cook that moment ar-
rived in the kitchen happened to be
quick-minded the under-cook too
had had of course some preparation
for this possibility

  one of the men seized a bowl just
used for beating eggs and with shak-
ing hands poured it half-full of warm
water from a heating kettle on the
stove into this the other emptied
nearly half a tin of dry mustard
which he stirred about frantically
with his floury hand this his eyes
rolling with terror he held to car-
rington s lips and -carrington con-
centrating afresh all his remaining
faculties forced the nauseous fluid
through his blue lips and swallowed
painfully great saving gulps of the
powerful emetic

  again and yet again the two ne-
groes renewed the dose

  one of the counselors on dfrrn
room duty coming into the kitchen
sensed something terribly amiss and
ran to support carrington

ten minutes later vastly nause-
ated trembling with weakness
but safe carrington leaning heavily
on the young counselor walked up
and down behind the mess hall his
first words after he could speak co-
herently were to order the assistant

cook to bum the contents of the three
hot plates in the oven   

  he had eaten a large mouthful of
one of the most deadly varieties of
poisonous mushroom one containing
the swiftly-acting vegetable alkaloids
which spell certain death his few
moments respite as he reasoned the
matter out afterward had been un-
doubtedly due to his having cooked
the mushrooms in butter of which he
had been lavish this thoroughly
soaked up by the mushrooms had for
a brief period resisted digestion

  very gradually as he walked up
and down taking in deep breaths of
the sweet pine-scented air his
strength returned to him after he
had thoroughly walked off the faint-
ness which had followed the violent
treatment to which he had subjected
himself he went up to his room and
still terribly shaken by his experience
and narrow escape from death went
to bed to rest

  crocker it appeared had duly car-
ried out his instructions dr benja-
min had looked at the specimen and
told the boy that there were several
varieties of this mushroom not easily
to be distinguished from one another
of which some were wholesome and
one contained a deadly alkaloid be-
ing otherwise occupied at the time he
would have to defer his opinion until
he had had an opportunity for a more
thorough examination he had hand-
ed back the mushroom submitted to
him and the lad had given it to a
counselor who had put it on the man-
tel-shelf intending to report to mr
carrington the following morning

  weak still and very drowzy car-
rington lay on his bed and silently
thanked the powers above for having
preserved his life

  abruptly he thought of his mother
the warning

  at once it was as though she stood
in the room beside his bed as though
across the gulp



he dared not raise his eyes because
now he knew that he was awake it
seemed to him as though she spoke
though there came to him no sensa-
tion of anything that could be com-
pared to sound

  ye must be getting back into your
bed laddie

  and keeping his eyes tightly shut
lest he disturb this visitation he awk-
wardly fumbled his way back into
bed he settled himself on his back
and an overpowering drowziness per-
haps begotten of his recent shock and
its attendant bodily weakness ran
through him like a benediction and a
refreshing wind

  as he drifted down over the thresh-
hold of consciousness into the deep
and prolonged sleep of physical ex-
haustion which completely restored
him his last remembrance was of the
lingering caress of his mothers firm
hand resting on his shoulder

the moon dance

                  by a leslie

                  throbbing drums a cold dead moon

                 and a whispering tropic strand

                   a play of shadows flitting free
                   across the tide-washed sand

                 a sighing wind that sobs and moans
                 and ever seems to flee

                 a pale ghost wind that hurries on
                 to a quest in the open sea

                 louder louder throb the drums

                 the shadows reel and sway

                 and the sobbing wind goes shuddering by
                 on its endless pathless way

                 slowly the cold moon sinks from sight
                 behind the jungles crest

                 softer and softer sound the drums

                  and the shadows come to rest

their long close companionship had
not been interrupted by death

  a wave of affectionate gratitude
suffused him under its influence he
rose wearily and sank to his knees
beside the bed his head on his arms
in the very spot where his mother
had seemed to stand in his dream

  tears welled into his eyes and fell
unnoticed as he communed silently
with her who had brought him into
the world whose watchful love and
care not even death could interrupt
or vitiate

  silently fervently he spoke across
the gulf to his mother   

  he choked with silent sobs as un-
derstanding of her invincible love
came to him and overwhelmed him
then to the accompaniment of a
tremulous calmness which seemed to
fall upon him abruptly he had the
sense of her standing close beside
him as she had stood in his dream

 vials of wrath

 by edith lyle ragsdale

it was carsons back there
could be no doubt about that i
would have known him any-
where

 i pushed my way through the
crowd and shoving this way and that
finally overtook my old friend

  i hadnt seen jim carson for a
number of years and remembered him
as an affable whole-hearted chap
with engaging irish-blue eyes and tar-
black hair imagine then my sur-
prize when as i reached him i saw
that his hair was snow-white that the
skin on his face was yellow and wrin-
kled like that of a mummy and
seemed grown to the bones that his
eyes once so merry were deep-set in
his cadaverous face filled with a hor-
ror a lurking fear the eyes of a man
who sees some hideous vision

  i tried to dissemble to suppress my
astonishment at this startling change
in my old friends appearance but
i might have saved myself the trou-
ble carson seemed lost to all minor
emotions he looked through me
past me the hand he offered was as
cold and clammy as that of a dead
man his voice was a hollow echo

  a sort of chill emanated from the
man a chill which clung about me
penetrating my bones until the mar-
row ached and lumping my blood un-
til knots formed beneath my skin

  i wished subconsciously that i had
not met up with him i actually trem-
bled but i tried to make the best of
my bad encounter

  my car was parked near by and
after a few words i asked him to be
my guest while in the city carson


consented so even though i felt an
emotion verging upon hysteria steal-
ing over me i drove out to the sub-
urbs where as maude was on her va-
cation i was keeping bachelor hall

  i was glad my wife was gone she
is a nervous high-strung woman
not for worlds would i have sub-
jected her to the ordeal of entertain-
ing carson man that i am robust
and disgustingly material in my
views i have received a shock which
time alone may eradicate

  the first hour after our arrival
passed off smoothly i prepared an
appetizing meal for my guest and my-
self and after supper we repaired to
the big cool porch and there over
cigars recounted our mutual boyhood
experiences under the sedative in-
fluence of the weed carson seemed to
thaw to become more human less a
dead man

  i began to feel that i had made a
mountain of a mole hill that i had
overestimated my friends looks and
manners

  i leaned back puffing contentedly
at my cigar carson was telling me
of an experience he had had while
coming home on the boat during the
days of submarine warfare he was
in the middle of a thrilling narrative
when the telephone rang

  i arose and passed into the house
maude was on the wire three hun-
dred miles away wanting to know
if i had fed the goldfish and if bobs
her canary was all right after
reassuring her on all points i re-
turned to my guest
vials of wrath



  at first i thought he was asleep
lying back in his chair then some-
thing about the pose struck me as
odd it was too rigid too tense to
be natural

  i moved over to him listened for
his breathing there was no sound

i	touched him he was cold i
thrust my hand into his shirt next
the skin the heart seemed stilled

  i	was afraid-abjectly afraid car-
son to all appearances was dead i
was alone all my old fear and re-
pugnance of the evening returned i
shuddered and my knees shook i felt
the hair at the base of my skull rise
like the bristles on the back of a dog
when it sees shades in the dark

  i	wondered if the authorities would
arrest me i cursed myself for run-
ning after and overtaking carson
for carrying him out to my heretofore
peaceful and uneventful h o m e
maude being psychic might even ob-
ject to living in a house overshadowed
by a mysterious death and i had
been until now perfectly happy in
the pretty little bungalow with its
big lawn and prodigality of roses

  then another thought struck me
what had caused jims death when
the telephone rang he had been talk-
ing with animation just prior to
our coming out on the porch he had
eaten a hearty supper

  again i bent over carson i fan-
cied i could see a change he looked
less rigid more relaxed i grew hope-
ful perhaps there might be a little
life left i ran to the telephone and
called our family physician

  when the doctor arrived i had car-
son stretched out on a lounge and was
rubbing him with camphor it was
the first thing that occurred to me

  the doctor produced his stetho-
scope and began hunting for signs of
animation after a bit he looked at
me and remarked reassuringly i he
isnt dead sort of coma has had a
shock a severe one i judge hell
w tv-

  rally from this but i fear he wont
last long three days perhaps

  he bared carsons arm and gave
him a shot of strychnin i watched
fascinated

  the doctor turned to me better
call an ambulance and have him taken
to st marys he will need expert
care-and there isnt a nurse here
now you can get for love or money

  i	acted upon the suggestion and
before midnight carson was resting
comfortably in the narrow white hos-
pital bed watched over by a serious-
eyed nun i stayed with him as long
as i could then left with the promise
that i would return the following
morning

when i again entered carsons
presence i saw that his mind
was clear there was also an inde-
finable change in the poor chaps ap-
pearance his eyes were free of the
expression of horror even his skin
looked less drawn but death sat
perched on the headboard

  carson smiled weakly and pointed
to a chair

  sit down old man he mur-
mured i obeyed and for a few min-
utes there was no word spoken then
stretching out a lean hand he laid
hold of my fingers and spoke

  i guess i am about to pass out
he began and i am glad every
minute for seven years  have longed
for death

  he paused struggling for breath
when he spoke again it was with less
effort and from the time he began
telling me of the occurrence that
turned him into an insatiate demon
he never wavered or paused until the
final word was spoken

you knew helen my wife be-
gan carson you knew her when
we three attended the university
you knew how beautiful she was with
her glorious golden hair and brown
eyes her satin-white skin fine in tex-
ture as a lily petal and you surmised


weird tales

her beautiful soul her purity her
wonderful personality but i alone
knew her i worshiped her as it is
given to few to worship our love
was without a flaw the years never
dimmed our affection and the birth
of our daughter three years after our
marriage cemented all the stronger
the bond between us

  you remember my desire to be a
missionary you recall that after
graduation i entered the college of
theology when i received my de-
gree when i bccame a regularly or-
dained minister of the gospel i felt
life held but little more of joy  my
cup of happiness was running over

  a month after i received my or-
ders we found ourselves on ship-
board outward bound for a post on
the african coast

  i was a religious fanatic i could
not see that there was work plenty
of it right at home the command

 go ye into every land and preach my
gospel meant to me just that i
wanted to go into every land and
spread the news

 when we rcached africa and i
saw what was before us i thrilled
the harvest was indeed ready for the
reaping i plunged into the work
and for a time failed to see the hard-
ships and dangers into which i had
brought my wife

  but eventually i began to sense
these things the climate failed to
agree with my darling she though
she never told me until long months
afterward feared the blacks her
health grew bad and not until our
babys birth did helen regain her for-
mer buoyant strength but with
babys advent my wifes sunny smile
came back and life again assumed a
rosy glow

  we were to a certain extent well
situated the mission house was
large made of heavy logs with strong
shuttered doors and windows we
had too some of the comforts of civ-
ilization such as screens to keep out

  the insects and serpents manufac-
tured goods shipped in from the
states and a private telephone line
connecting my outposts with the mis-
sion house

  from the first my wifes wonder-
ful sweetness of manner and her
great beauty acted upon the blacks
like a charm they gave her a native
name which translated means lily-
white

  my success was phenomenal soon
the work was progressing beyond my
most sanguine hopes the servants
and laborers employed about the mis-
sion house were my first converts
these men and women forsook their
hideous rites voodooism disappeared
from that particular point and in its
stead came peace plenty and clean
living

  	 the early converts became in turn
missionaries wherever they went
with whomsoever they talked they
even though crudely spread the gos-
pel and i loved my people true
their skins were black and their ways
were not my ways but for all that i
knew they were my brothers spirit
of my spirit for more than three
years i preached to them taught
them to read and write and work i
doctored their bodies as well as their
souls and in every way helen my
lily-white aided me but this peace-
ful existence was but the calm before
the storm

vne day a strapping black placed

   himself in my path he looked
worried and harried a prescience
of evil swept over me as he began in
halting and lame english to tell me
of mogo a powerful medicine man
of the tribe who was trying to de-
moralize and stampede my converts

  from the mans disjointed narra-
tive i learned that mogo was prac-
tising the most revolting forms of
voodooism that he had instituted a
revival of ancient heathen sacrifices
was practising cannibalism and wag-
vials of wrath



ing war against the spread of civiliza-
tion and religion

  i questioned the black but once
having told me of the trouble the fel-
low seemed to withdraw into himself
and i could gather nothing further

  all our servants were loyal the
big black men three in number em-
ployed about the place vied with each
other in their devotion to helen and
the baby i never felt a fear for the
safety of my loved ones even though
at times i was called miles away to
other villages or even into the inte-
rior

  one day shortly after the conver-
sation with the black he again inter-
cepted me the story he had to tell
me was exceptionally revolting mogo
had gathered around him a following
of degenerate negroes and the next
night which happened to be full
moon there was to be a meeting with
the added attraction of human sacri-
fice the place of meeting was on the
banks of a sluggish little river not
much more than a creek-a thick
oozy stream swarming with croco-
diles

  i decided to be on hand even
though the danger was great and to
prevent the sacrifice if possible be-
cause of the risk i had to tell some
of the facts to my wife naturally
she was shocked by the disclosures
and entreated me to stay away fiom
the scene of the crime

  but this i could not do i had
given myself to the work i would
be a coward a poltroon less than a
man were i to let pass unrebuked an
orgy such as mogo planned

  the distance from the mission
house to the scene of the meeting was
nearly twenty miles through swamp
and underbrush and rank vegetation
past a small town the last point
where i could communicate with
helen by telephone a hard soul-sap-
ping journey for a white man

  i obtained the service of my in-
formant as guide and we set out

through the swamps at the village
i stopped for food and rest and the
precious solace of a few words over
the telephone with helen the dear
girl even though her heart was torn
by fears spoke bravely and encour-
agingly she held our baby to the in-
strument and let her babble to dada

  i told helen that should she
want me she could call me at this
point and a black would get the word
to me but helen laughed away my
fears she had our three servants be-
sides the woman who did the cooking
and housework since baby came

  just before dusk i with the black
guiding along before me set out on
the last lap of my journey the
moon was not yet up and the shadows
were black all about us from tree
and bush came eery calls and strange
noises from the rank grass and vege-
tation the hiss and rustle of serpents

  by the time the moon was up we
had reached a vantage point and
secreting ourselves we watched the
preparation for the consummation of
the lustful deed

  a throne of logs had been erected
and upon this mogo a powerful vil-
lainous-looking giant sat directing
the axrangements from our covert i
watched the play of the corded mus-
cles beneath the satin-black skin the
bloodshot whites of the eyes the cruel
twist of the protruding lips

  a crowd formed quickly like
shadows they slunk from out of the
gloom a big heap of inflammable
material was piled in an open space a
few yards from the throne near the
river bank

  i could not understand much of
mogos harangue but that he was
a sort of spellbinder i could readily
see as he talked his followers many
of whom had professed the christian
faith fell prone before the throne
for an hour the big black talked
lashing the crowd to fury


weird tales

  suddenly mogo sprang to his feet
waving his arms shouting eyes roll-
ing foam flecking his lips

  the negroes seemed to go mad
those that had fallen to the ground
now leapt to their feet and men and
women alike began tearing their gar-
ments someone set fire to the brush-
heap and i sickened as i saw the
blacks join hands and dance naked
around the blazing pyre

  the dance grew in violence and
abandonment with the stripping off
of their garments civilization and re-
ligion were cast aside they were
just what their ancestors had been
they screamed a chant they leapt
into the air they clawed their flesh
until blood mingled with the sweat of
their glistening bodies and mogo
urged them on

  out over the sluggish water the
blood-red glow of the fire crept a
bull crocodile stuck his repulsive head
above the scum and snapped his jaws

  a hideous old hag ran to the
shadows just without the brilliant cir-
cle of firelight and caught up a new-
born child unwashed and unban-
daged and with toothless mouthings
she laid it in mogos hands

  the medicine man sprang up
screamed a sort of prayer or incanta-
tion and before i could divine his in-
tention flung the wailing child into
the open jaws of the crocodile as
the creatures jaws crunched the
writhing little body a young and not
uncomely woman dashed into the cir-
cle of light shrieking madly

  again mogo began his chant a
dozen powerful blacks sprang forward
and as the crocodiles fought for the
bleeding morsel and as the waters
turned a deeper red than that caused
by the firelight the young mother was
seized and dragged resisting fighting
even- inch of the way to the throne

  i heard mogo bellow a command
i saw a huge pot rushed to the fire as
my senses reeled i saw the woman be-

headed dismembered and thrown into
the pot

vxiien consciousness returned i

  v	v was lying on a bed in the vil-
lage hotel i essayed to rise but i
could not i called and a cowering
black answered it was my guide to
whom i owed my life

  i asked him the time how long i
had been there his answer was stag-
gering i had been unconscious three
days

  my first thought was of helen i
knew her peril i had caught enough
of mogo s harangue to understand 

  i knew even though god had
kept her safe that her anxiety over
my absence and silence must be mad-
dening i again tried to get up but
my knees were weak and i wabbled
back fell upon the bed and less
than ten steps away was the tele-
phone

  i dozed for a time i was terri-
bly ill i felt that i was dying i
seemed to float between earth and sky

  the shrill ringing of the tele-
phone bell caught me jerked me back
to things mundane i knew that it
was helen that she needed me even
before i with the help of the black
managed to reach the instrument a
nameless dread clutched my heart

  mogo had gathered his followers
about him and with the craftiness of
the devil had worked upon their
fears their superstitions until they
became as wax in his hands the
lily-white must be destroyed just
so long as the yellow-haired woman
lived their god zombo would frown
upon them

  all this helen told me i cried
out and beat my hands for i knew
theie was more to come i sensed
that danger menaced my darlings

  again my beloveds voice eame to
me they are attacking the house
now she said and the calmness of
despair held her voice steady  they
vials of wrath



are battering down the front door
our servants are assisting them

  i cursed cursed cursed in
that moment i became a devil even
now i am amazed at the depths of
evil into which this horror plunged
me

  i called to helen that i was com-
ing to her but her voice never trem-
bled as she made answer do not
leave the wire it will be but a few
minutes before it is all over you
could not possibly reach here in time

let us talk to each other-until-

  she told me quite calmly that
she was barricaded in her chamber
that when our servants deserted her
she had locked the doors and win-
dows taken the baby and repaired to
the upper story where the telephone
was located

   helen i called helen are you
-armed

  her voice came back clearly
yes i will wait until i am certain

when i am certain- it is the

only way baby first then i-

  again a pause then they are
in the house-coming up the stair
i hear our servants there are four
more with them   they are pound-
ing on the door  it is beginning
to crack darling i must save-
baby

  frenzied with horror i crouched
there my ear to the receiver i could
hear blows rained upon the door i
heard a shot i screamed wildly i
knew that my baby my bright-eyed
darling was dead again i heard
helen speaking it is almost over
dear love she said i have set fire
to the room mogos cannibals must
not-

  again i heard a babel of sounds
of screams curses and blows

   the fire is burning rapidly
came the dear voice the blacks
know i have outwitted them but

they are still at the door i-

 a rending crash interrupted her
the door caved in i heard helen

scream i heard a shot then the con-
nection was severed and i fell for-
ward unconscious

  for days i was a maniac when
reason again asserted itself i re-
turned to the scene of the tragedy
a pile of blackened embers was all
that remained of the house i
searched the ruins and found a few
human bones these i gave christian
burial and over them i vowed a vow

  it has taken me a long time to ful-
fil it but-i have done so

  carsons voice had become a mere
whisper but he struggled on his eyes
fixed on mine

  yes he repeated it took a long
time but-i accomplished my vow
i found the seven who murdered my
wife and babe and one by one i cruci-
fied them-head down if you ever
visit africa you can find their rotting
carcasses in a cave back a short dis-
tance from the mission house site i
am the only living person who knows
of the existence of this cave but
here he produced a roughly sketched
chart take this and you will find it
without difficulty

  his eyes flickered and closed for
a moment i thought he had answered
the last call but with his ebbing
breath he struggled on

  from that day-i go insane when
-i hear a telephone bell i live again
the awful agony of that hour i can
see it all-all

  i tried to soothe him but he seemed
past all human help i sat beside his
cot stunned unable to think clearly

  for a time he slept then his eyes
flew open he sprang up in bed and
a look of ecstasy overspread his
drawn features

  	 helen  he cried   why helen
my darling

  my eyes involuntarily followed the
direction of carsons when i looked
at him again he was lying back on his
pillows a smile of serene peace upon
his dead gray face
a startling tale of thought
transmission by radio

the

experiment of erich
weigert

 by sewell peaslee wright

the moment i gazed out over
the audience i saw him he
was seated far back under the
balcony that overhung the little audi-
torium but even in the heavy shadow
i could see his eyes eyes that seemed
alight with cold brilliance like a dia-
mond in the moonlight

  although i was more or less accus-
tomed to public speaking and was
very much at home with my subject
that evening radio as it used to
be something about the unfaltering
regard of the man under the balcony
confused me his eyes were on me
constantly every move i made every
gesture every change in expression
those unwinking blue orbs seemed to
register

  i wondered who he was surely i
had never seen him before nor he me
i caught myself addressing myself to
him and when once his head seemed
to nod slightly as though in approval
of something i had said a strange
thrill of pleasure tingled along my
spine there was a power in the
man a sort of benign malignancy i
was glad when i finished and could
eseape from that unwavering regard

after the meeting broke up he
came up toward the stage where i
was chatting with several officers of
the radio association responsible for


the meeting i had just addressed
they moved away as they noted the
strangers obvious intention to speak
to me

  he was a little man i saw now not
more than five feet six inches in
height but his shoulders were broad
and massive and his head was larger
than mine

  but it was his face that held my
gaze his eyes as i had said seemed
to bum coldly with the same chilly
weird blue light of an electric spark
they were deep-set eyes separated
with a thin sharply beaked nose that
somehow seemed repulsively cruel
his mouth was thin and turned down
sharply at the corners two deep wrin-
kles springing from near the base of
his nose accenting its contour above
a high forehead that bulged strange-
ly clung tangled sparse gray locks

  he smiled ingratiatingly as he drew
near and as he spoke his voice was
surprizingly pleasant

  mr saylor i enjoyed your talk
very much indeed for a man of your
years you have a very keen insight
into radio

  he offered his hand as he spoke
and i took it cordially for all his
unprepossessing appearance there
was a certain appeal about the man
the strength of his personality at-
the experiment of erich weigert



traded more than his appearance re-
pelled

  ive been working with radio for
fourteen years now i replied smil-
ing ham marconi op experi-
mental work for a manufacturer de-
signing all that sort of thing bound
to pick up a little here and there you
know

  yes indeed a great deal of ex-
perience for a young man you
seem-pardon me i have neglected
to introduce myself erich weigert
at your service he bowed a quick
little foreign military bow heels to-
gether if you have nothing else
in mind mr saylor and would be
interested i would like to take you
through my own little laboratory this
evening  

  erich weigert and an invitation
to go through his laboratory it is
no wonder that i gasped i had heard
of him as a wealthy somewhat mys-
terious recluse with scientific leanings
but i had never seen him before that
memorable night

eigerts machine soon whisked

v	 ug ll to his residence near the
outskirts of the city only a few
lights were burning as we turned in
at the grass-grown drive but i could
make out the house as a massive
square pile squat and ugly in the
moonlight topped with an octagonal
cupola like some uncouth excrudes-
cenee its panes glaring bleakly over
the rather extensive high-walled
grounds that surrounded the place

  the door was opened by a young
woman whom a moment later weigert
introduced as his wife the affection
and pride in his voice as he presented
me struck me as being the first real
feeling that he had evidenced since
i had met him

  he had a very real reason for his
pride for his wife was undeniably
beautiful the instant she raised her
soft dark eyes to mine i was struck
almost dumb with their remarkable

loveliness i say i was struck almost
dumb i say that because to talk of
love at first sight is to bring up
visions of youthful exaggerations it
is true that as vera weigert and i
looked into each others eyes that
night something was bom of that
union of glances that never died-
that never will die call it what you
will for i must on with my story

  i remember but vaguely the trip
through the big bare laboratory that
weigert had made of two adjoining
rooms at one side of the house later
i became very well acquainted with
the delicate instruments the gener-
ators and transformers and the im-
mense variety oftubes with which the
laboratory was equipped but that
night my mind was too full of vera
weigert it was not until after wei-
gert invited me to a chair in front
of the big fireplace in the front room
between himself and his wife that the
trend of his conversation began to
make an impression on my mind

  your remark this evening that the
mystery had all gone from radio de-
spite the fact that radio was doing
greater marvels today than ever
struck me particularly weigert
said with a nod of approval glancing
first at me and then at his wife it
is true today they hook up eight
tubes and hear from one coast to an-
other or perhaps one continent listens
to another-with the power of the
sending station listed in many thou-
sands of watts bali it is lie kill-
ing ants with a steam-roller in the
days when we caught the buzz and
scratch of spark signals two thousand
miles away - and more - with our
crystals silicon galena perikon -
then there was mystery romance to
radio today my barbers wife can
twiddle the switches and dials of her
set and copy from coast to coast as
easily as she can change the records
on her phonograph the scientist
the man with imagination has left
that phase of radio far behind it is


weird tales

a husk from whieh all the sweetness
has been sucked  

  true i nodded i find no in-
terest in radio communications now
but sir the transmission of photo-
graphs by radio-and we arc doing
that now you know-fires my imag-
ination i have been working myself
along those lines i added some-
what timidly for erich weigert had
a terrific force of personality that
made me feel very young beside him
perhaps the day is not so far off
when we shall be able to broadcast
moving pictures as well as the music
to accompany them

  aber aber that is but a step
broke in weigert interrupting me
with sudden and unexpected violence
first code then speech then pic-
tures good a start perhaps but
-not more than a start mr say-
lor he dropped his voice until it
was little more than an insinuating
whisper and his eyes gleamed with
indescribable earnestness thought
thats the thing the transmission of
thought through the ages they have
tried it some have claimed to have
perfected it but it was never so be-
tween two particular individuals per-
haps but it has never been made a
science radio can make it a science
mr saylor radio and i

  i think he would have said more
but his wife deftly changed the sub-
ject and weigert allowed himself to
be led by the soft leash of her voice
as for me i was in a sort of uneasy
paradise to be there beside her to lis-
ten to her sweet voice and the rest
of the evening flew by far too quickly

  for days after two voices ruled my
brain one was her soft good night
mr saylor and the other was erich
weigerts cordial invitation to return
to talk radio again some other night
very soon should i go or should
i heed the warning that my inner self
shrieked in my mental ears should
i place myself as one side of a tri-
angle  and such a triangle it was

very evident that weigert was wild-
ly in love with his young wife and
with his temperament and personality
-but why prolong the debate that
raged in my mind  you know if you
have ever been a man and young
how it was decided i went-went
not once but many times

  i think that erich weigert grew
for me a real affection i could follow
him along the lesser-trodden paths of
radio research and could even lead
him into some of the ramifications of
the great science my ideas or at
least many of them agreed with his
own and to the man who had cut
himself off from the rest of the world
that he might devote himself to his
work i suppose i was a welcome con-
tact point with the outside

  it was the love that waxed and grew
between vera and myself that caused
me the most concern there was that
between us that made every moment
near her a bitter paradise a joyous
hell and that she responded to my
passion with a love as great as my
own i had only to look into her eyes
to see

  a quick pressure of her hand a
touch on the arm in passing little
things yet they were all we had and
they were enough to drive me to any
madness

one night weigert excused himself
for a moment to fetch some-
thing from the laboratory as he
disappeared through the heavy drapes
her eyes met mine and for a long
moment we sat drinking deep of the
forbidden draft then compelled
by a force greater than the will of
either of us we rose to our feet and
an instant later i had her in my
arms my lips crushed on hers

  i thought that i caught out of the
corner of my eyes a movement of the
drapes across the door and she de-
tected my sudden start

  what is it dear she whispered
the experiment op erich weigert	

 nothing but i thought the
drapes moved just then it startled
me for a moment  

  it might have been him she
whispered fiercely he is a devil

he knows everything perhaps-

but before she could finish we heard
his steps coming down the hall and
we hastened to seat ourselves

  evidently weigert had not been
spying on us for he was his normal
self when he entered the room in-
tensely jealous though he was he had
never seemed to see the love that was
between his wife and me

  i should have read the man better
should have realized that those cold
blue eyes missed nothing and that
such a personality could dissemble un-
til-until-

ve have often talked about

  v	 thought transmission by radio
saylor you remember weigert
was talking to me over the phone as
we often chatted of an afternoon
when both of us had a little time
there was a certain tenseness in his
voice that vaguely excited me

  yes i answered quickly have

you-

  	 i think so i am going to try the
experiment tonight would you care
to be on hand and assist me

  i certainly deem it an honor to be
asked

  he chuckled as at some private bit
of humor before he replied

  will you be on hand at  sharp
then  i must get to work now
theres a lot to do before tonight
remember  oclock sharp

  it was exactly three minutes of 
when erich weigert admitted me
that night i showed him my watch
laughingly

see how well i obeyed orders
fine he nodded we will go
directly to the laboratory i am nat-
urally anxious as to the success of our
experiment

  the cold glitter in his eyes and the
deepening of the harsh lines that ac-
cented the habitual sneer on the thin
lips had told me at first glance that
his nerves were near the breaking
point and as he spoke a vibrant un-
dertone of his voice affirmed the truth
of my judgment

  the laboratory as i have said was
composed of two rooms but tonight
weigert had pulled tightly shut the
sliding doors between them before
i had time to question him even had
i felt so inclined he directed my at-
tention to a table in the center of the
room on it was a mass of apparatus
in which i recognized many familiar
instruments although one or two of
the devices were utterly foreign to
my experience four receiving tubes
burned near one edge of the tangle

  sit down in the chair saylor
suggested weigert  you re going to
act as the receiving agent in this lit-
tle test since you so kindly volun-
teered to help there so

  he placed me in a big overstuffed
chair that stood beside the table and
directed his attention to the appa-
ratus

  you see i have reasoned it out
this way he commented as he
worked   thought is a function of the
brain therefore-he turned to me
with an odd contrivance in his hand
a collarlike piece of apparatus at-
tached to some part of the array on
the table by two long flexible wires-
receiving of thought must be by
getting in contact with the brain
either directly or through nerves run-
ning to the brain understand

  i nodded only partly understand-
ing and yet dominated utterly by
the intense blue light that flared in
his agate-hard blue eyes

   so then we place this little col-
lar of soft chamois around your neck
buckling it tightly in place he con-
tinued suiting the action to the word
that cold sensation you feel at the
back is nothing but a plate of heavy


weird tales

silver foil its function is to conduct
to the nerve-cable of your spinal col-
umn the thought impulses after they
are sufficiently amplified and ener-
gized by this apparatus

  for a few minutes he seemed to
forget me utterly and he leaned over
the apparatus on the table inspecting
it testing and adjusting i watched
him curiously a premonition of evil
settling down over me as a cold ocean
fog rolls down into the lowlands i
was glad when he finally straightened
up and once more spoke

  everything seems to be all
ready he said im not quite sure
what current will be needed here so
ill cut out this potentiometer slowly
you tell me-and he put his face
close to mine and glared down into
my eyes-what you feel

  but-but the other subject i
ventured who is transmitting

	the other subject he said curt-
ly is in the next room keep your
mind as free from outside thoughts as
you can close your eyes relax
in the stillness of the room i could
hear the slight scrape of the contact
arm over the wires of the potentio-
meter but save for a nervous tickle
up and down my spine i could feel
nothing

  not enough eh questioned
weigert evidently watching my im-
passive face i shook my head

  the potentiometer scraped again
and i became aware of a soft warm-
ness in the region directly under the
metal plate a warmth that crept up-
ward until it suffused the whole base
of my brain there was a sort of un-
dulating quality about it that made
me dizzy that seemed to make me
reel and sway even as i sat ensconced
in the broad arms of the chair

  it begins to make itself felt

  i opened my eyes with a little start
his voice seemed to come from some
outer world

  weigert was peering down at me
hisb-ii eye  flight with scientific fer-

vor-or was it something more he
scowled as he saw my eyes open

  keep your eyes shut he com-
manded harshly how can the ex-
periment succeed if you disobey or-
ders i closed my eyes and sank
back into the chair and again the
surging heat swept upward into my
brain i heard the potentiometer
scrape more and more 

it is hard to put down in black and
white that which sounds so incred-
ible that i myself can hardly believe
it but i shall try

  the pulsation of the warm waves
increased slowly at first and then
with a sudden rush although my
eyes were tightly shut the impression
of great red roaring flames swept be-
fore me as though my face were
buried in a very fountain of fire

  and then gradually a thought was
born in my mind not a thought as it
springs to the normal conscious mind
but a thought from without forced it-
self into my mind and grew there
swelling from an unrecognizable seed
to a palpitant growth - and the
thought that had been planted in my
mind and that grew there so vividly
as if before some inner eye was a
thought of love love as boundless as
space itself as real and actual as a
mighty block of granite love love
for me soundless formless words
as intangible and elusive as wisps of
mist swam through my bursting
brain words of affection endear-
ment sacrifice love

  i was aware too of another ele-
ment as though the picture was shot
through with intermittent flashes of
red disrupting light pain agony
fear despair these were the things
that were marring the beauty of my
inward vision i could feel my face
writhe with the beauty and the
horror of it all but it held me en-
thralled in its mysterious grasp i
wanted to tear the accursed thing
the experiment of erich weigert



from my throat to leap up to cry

aloud-

  suddenly totally the torture
stopped there were only the warm
throbbing waves of feeling inundat-
ing my brain i opened my eyes and
leaped from the chair cursing

  what damnable thing is this you
have here i shouted i have been
to hell and back again i should have
gone crazy had you not turned it off
when you did

  the eager curious light went from
erich weigerts eyes and in its place
came a glint of sardonic amusement

  i did not turn it off he said
calmly but i can imagine why you
thought i did he deftly removed
the band around my neck and tossed
it carelessly onto the table and
now-would you not like to see-the
other subject the sender

 an icy chill gripped my every
nerve and sinew there was something
diabolically sinister in the mans face
and in the soft tones of his voice

  i nodded dumbly still dazed from
the experiment and stumbled in his
wake to the closed double doors he
slid the doors open and stood aside
that i might enter

  on an operating table near the
door lay a figure covered with a long
white sheet a faint odor as of an
anesthetic came to my nostrils but
there was something about the abso-
lute deathly stillness of the supine
figure that told me i was in the pres-
ence of death itself

  trembling the blood draining from
my face i stood and stared at the still
figure and at the instrument-littered
table beside the operating table
three small wires from the maze of
instruments on the table disappeared
under the edge of the sheet two big
transmitting tubes glowed yellowly in
the bright light that flooded the room
a dim horrible idea began to take
shape in my mind

see chuckled weigert his voice
grating on the silence like the screech

of a rusty hinge the sending sub-
ject

  he strode forward and tore the
sheet from the figure

  i felt my knees tremble beneath
me and i leaned against the wall for
support there on the table dressed
in a simple white robe lay the body
of vera weigert

  my eyes refused to move from the
fearful sight a spot above either ear
had been shaved and on the scalp
thus exposed a red circle with edges
-my god

  just as the receiving element
must work directly upon the nerve
trunk i heard weigert saying the
sending must be done at least with
the crude apparatus i have direct
from the emanating source and
that of course is-the brain hence
the trephine that seems to strike you
as so interesting

  this little band passes under the
head as you see and presses two silver
disks directly upon the brain or
strictly speaking upon the dura
mater to get the desired contact

  faster and faster the man spoke-
or did my reeling senses imagine that 
his voice from a calm scientific mon-
otone rose almost to a chriek

  there she is saylor why dont
you caress her hand now  why dont
you hold her close and press her lips
now man  there she is and with the
last spark of her energy she sent you
a message saylor what was the
message you wont tell me it
must have been wonderful wonder-
ful

  i knew the experiment would be
a success you two loved each other
you were attuned as two human be-
ings seldom are attuned it was an
ideal opportunity to prove that i was
right that thought could be trans-
mitted-and to avenge myself upon a
faithless wife and a faithless friend

  i tried to speak but my dry tongue
refused to move from the roof of my
m

weird tales

mouth but he saw my throat move
and he chuckled again

 you would deny it eh you-

but no matter let me tell you how
i did it it will interest you

  i told her what i was going to do
told her that if she did not submit
i would take your life as the penalty
and-does this give you pleasure
saylor-she consented

  i gave her scopolamin-morphin as
an anesthetic for i knew that would
permit her subconscious mind to con-
tinue its functioning then careful-
ly-oh very carefully for i did not
want her to die too soon-i trephined
the skul just at the fissure of syl-
vius thus locating my electrodes in
the sensory area very well thought
out was it not

  i knew that her last thoughts
would be of you thoughts of love for
her lover strong thoughts you
know thoughts that would enable my
unperfected apparatus to work to
prove that my idea is feasible
thoughts that would hold over and
run constantly through her subcon-
scious mind thoughts of love eh
saylor and thoughts of fear too
perhaps ah i thought i read that
in your face man anti can you blame
her it is not pleasant to die when
you are young and very beautiful and
in love

  he paused and drew the tip of his
tongue across his thin bloodless lips

  and-oh this was a joke i had
not thought of-you thought i
turned it off did you you false
friend you fool you meddler
you heard-and his voice rose to a
shriek like that of a maniac in hell-
i tell you saylor you heard tier
die

  i shook off the icy grip that had
numbed me and leaped for the man
but before i could sink my clutching
fingers in his throat he stopped me at
the point of a gun which he flashed
from a pocket

 back he shrieked back i
dont want to kill you i want you to
live and remember-but if you move
ill shoot to maim i have my plans
all laid for my escape and-

 just then i lunged the gun
roared over my head and the stench
of the powder smoke swirled in my
nostrils we went down on the floor
together in a whirling flaying heap
the instrument table fell over with a
terrific crash and as i fought i saw
out of the corner of my eye a flicker
of red flame shoot up as the tangled
high-voltage wires hissed their danger
signal

  it was over in a few minutes he
was a maniac and fought with a
maniacs strength but i was possessed
of ten thousand devils i wrenched
the gun from his hand and put it to
his head holding him down with my
body and my left arm in a wrestling
hold i had learned years ago

  his cold blue eyes looked up into
mine glinting with sardonic amuse-
ment

  and now for the great experi-
ment he said panting shoot

  i glanced up at the still figure on
the operating table the flames were
beginning to roar now and were lick-
ing fiercely at the woodwork then i
placed the gun directly above his ear
closed my eyes and pulled the trigger

 never looked back the papers
ran a story of a recluse and his
wife trapped in a night fire the
bodies were so burned that they could
not detect the holes-both just above
the ear

 but i know i know i who
heard or felt or lived a womans
dying thoughts i know

  and tonight-now just as soon as
i write the last word of this-i shall
know more for then i shall put the
same gun to my head carefully just
above the ear and-pull-the-trig-

 the

confession of a madman

          by james cocks

the curtain is parted by an
honest fearless man whose
education was just sufficient
to make a good laborious living and
give him command of a coastwise
ship he knew nothing of the so-
called cults of the past or present
although he was not a scholar his
consciousness was thrilled with the
knowledge that he was a man he
knew virtually nothing of what other
men may have thought or written
but by virtue of the consciousness of
manhood that abided in him he dared
to think and ask the reason why and
with equal persistence search out the
answer



ttor reasons i need not explain here
 i spent one week in the quaint
little town of padstow it was a snug
little seaport town teeming with in-
dustry having no less than two ship-
building yards working at full speed
it lay embedded in a small valley pro-
tected on three sides by high rolling
hills-a haven in time of storm

  the entrance to this port is one of
the most dangerous on the cornish
coast padstow points on one side
pentire points on the other both bris-
tling with jagged rocks like the fangs
of some huge monster some distance
in from the open sea there is a bar
of sand called the dunebar this
lies in the very center of the pas-
sageway leading into padstow and
can be seen when the tide is low

only a skilled pilot can guide a ship
through in safety hundreds of ships
and men have been engulfed in its
treacherous quicksands

  the main walk leading from the
town forms a large circle above the
cliffs designated by some as the lov-
ers walk however it is used by all
alike for it furnishes a continual re-
freshing view as one traverses this
winding path it brings to view the
sand dunes on the opposite side of the
wide channel tradition says that
here lies an entire town buried by a
terrific sandstorm

  as one travels around the high
cliffs he is led directly to a command-
ing fort containing a few guns which
silently watch the entrance to this
land-protected port a little farther
around the cliffs is padstow cove
where the high rolling ground is sud-
denly parted as if hewn out by some
titanic force a number of neat little
cottages dot the sloping sides and a
pretty sandy beach slants gracefully
into the channel immediately in the
center of this beach stands the life-
boat house

 my advent into padstow was in
november the weather was cold and
unsettled in the early part of my
first evening in this quaint old town
i was sitting in the bar parlor smok-
ing a cigar and warming my knees
by the fire-perhaps feeling a little
dull

  in a little while a strong wind came
up which soon became a gale mine

                                  


weird tales

t

host came into the room and sat down
opposite me by the fire he said in
a very serious tone i fear sir we
are in for a terrible storm tonight
god pity any ship that comes near the
points

  in answer to my casual enquiry
mine host pointed out the many dan-
gers that confronted the mariner in
time of storm before he had got
through his rather prolonged descrip-
tion the wind began to whistle
around the comers and eaves of the
roofs the town seemed suddenly to
wake up many people were hurrying
on the streets and excited voices
could be heard every few minutes
then an old seafaring man burst into
the room and looking at mine host
shouted by god henry theres
a foreigner ship on the dunebar

  i sprang to my feet put on my top-
coat and left the room following
the crowd i came to the lovers
walk i do not recall ever seeing
such a change in the weather in so
short a time the sea was lashing
itself into a fury and i recalled mine
hosts remark i would pity any
ship in such a storm

in a very short time we had reached
a point overlooking the cove
there was indeed a ship fast going to
pieces on the dunebar the terrific
monsterlike clouds were parted as if
by some magic hand leaving a clear
space over the huge points and re-
vealing the terrible drama being en-
acted before our eyes never saw i
such a scene-and never do i wish to
see it again the foundering ship
was lifted as if by gigantic hands on
the crest of high waves bristling in
their terrible whiteness then they re-
ceded leaving the trembling ship to
strike the cruel dunebar with a sick-
ening crash even above the thunder
and hiss of the sea we could hear the
piercing shriek of splitting timber
and the snapping of bolts that once
held the stately ship together in a

few minutes the ship was a mass of
floating wreckage

  my attention was directed to a com-
manding figure standing alone on a
jutting piece of rock overhanging the
frightful sea his sea-cap seemed
glued to his head and shoulders and
his beard was combed by the cutting
wind both hands were shading his
eyes-he was scanning the angry sea

  i turned to a man by my side and
asked   who is that man out there   

  the man replied why stranger
thats tom edivinn the lion-hearted
-the bravest man that ever stood in
two shoes

  this stalwart dark figure silhouet-
ted against the sky with pentire
points frowning in the distance
seemed to fascinate me suddenly
this figure turned and sprang like a
cat from the jutting point and tore
down the sloping hill to the cove
many followed his example but i
was the first to get near him there
were many men and women at the
cove some bitterly weeping for they
knew only too well that on the mor-
row there would be bodies washed
ashore

  i saw the beautiful lifeboat spick
and span shining like a thing of life
in the semi-gloom on each side of her
were the crew i thought i had never
seen such giants of manhood before
i knew these brave cornishmen would
sacrifice their lives without an in-
stants thought if need be to save the
life of their fellow man tom as we
now shall call him strode over to this
group of silent determined men   

 s i was soon to learn tom edi-
-- vinn was one of the bravest men
on the cornish coast he was a
powerful man six feet three inches
in height wide-shouldered and some-
what gaunt-alert as agile as a cat
as strong as an ox with muscles of
whiplike steel he wore a full well-
trimmed beard and though kindly-
looking was grave in his demeanor
the confession of a madman



as gentle as a lamb yet he knew not
the meaning of fear such were the
general characteristics of this man
whose figure silhouetted against the
sky on the jutting rock had fascina-
ted me some who had been with him
in absolute danger with death star-
 ing them in the face said his eyes
shone like balls of fire and flashed
like miniature lightning an hun-
dred times he had taken his life in
his hands to rescue some mariner

  when tom reached the lifeboats
crew he cried out with a loud voice
come on men-theres a man out
there alive he pointed to the rag-
ing sea he cant last more than a
few minutes

  the captain of the crew replied
tom its no use-no boat can live
in such a sea

  there were now hundreds of people
assembled and all eyes were centered
on this group of men

  tom cried out no man shall die
with tom edivinn looking on

   his little boat was near at hand
and the next moment he was gliding
with it over the slanting slippery
beach with the receding wave he
launched himself into the seething
sea a cry rent the air brave tom
has gone to his doom

  every few minutes tom was seen
on the crest of a wave battling with
the sea and every time he appeared
to view a shout of thankfulness went
up to god he disappeared in a great
hollow of the sea with a piece of
wreckage to which clung the last life
of the doomed ship an instant later
he was seen on the crest of a wave-
there were two men in toms little
boat

  breathlessly the throng watched
him could he make the narrow
cove if he could not no power on
earth could save him from certain
death

  ah an intense sigh seemed to
ooze from hungering hearts hes
going to make it as sure as

heaven in a few minutes he was
seen on the crest of a mighty wave
opposite the mouth of the cove-in
another instant like a feather he was
carried into the cove and dashed upon
the beach



t n the lifeboat house men and wom-
en ministered to the seaman whom
tom had rescued the fellow was
badly shaken up and dazed from
his trying ordeal he was sufficiently
recovered however to recognize in
tom the one who had saved his life
soon he was comfortably asleep be-
tween warm blankets

  when tom avas himself again he
came and looked at the man he had
saved lie gave a start then a shade
of pallor swept over his features and
this avas quickly replaced avith a look
of fondest affection he made no re-
mark to those standing by and soon
he joined the others in avatching for
the floating dead

  a feav evenings later i sat chatting
with mine host in the bar parlor of
the cornish arms the aveather was
cold and the fire avas very cheering
there seemed unusual activity in the
tavern room termed by some the tap
room and by others tke kitchen
soon there came the notes of joyous
song accompanied by the saveet
strains of a violin i sensed a wistful
longing to be among those men of toil
to share with them their simple
amusement

  mine host seemed to have antici-
pated my desire

  the boys will have a pleasant eve-
ning in the tap room tonight he
remarked i have seen to it they
shall have a cheery fire it will be a
cold night and many will have an
extra pint of ale if you avould care
to pass an hour avith them i will in-
troduce you to the boys i can assure
you you will hear some good yams
songs and jokes


weird tales

   in a few minutes i was comfortably
seated in their midst i was surprized
to learn that there was an organized
rule for the evenings amusement
they had a regular chairman who
sat at the center of a long table
somewhat elevated where he could
command a view of the large room
he knew each one that could sing a
song tell a joke or dance a jig it
was strictly understood that no or-
ders could be given or filled while a
part was being rendered if the
story was a long one at given points
there would be an intermission for a
few minutes to satisfy the wants of
the throng this order of procedure
was only one evening of each week
if a stranger came the privilege of
contributing to the evenings amuse-
ment was extended

  i was gratified to see tom edivinn
seated at the end of a large settee
near the fire immediately opposite
where i sat so i had a splendid op-
portunity to study him he was cer-
tainly a rcmarkable-looking man the
most powerful i had seen in many a
day he was not fleshy yet he was
not thin but bony and sinewy his
full beard was neatly trimmed to a
point a little below his chin his eyes
were large with heavy lashes and
crowned with bushy brows his hair
beard and brows were dark brown
a fitting background for his expansive
forehead and rounded cheeks he
wore a heavy coarse blue shirt open
at the throat his head was capped
with a heavy oiled southwester with
sea-boots reaching above his knees
to my sense he was a perfect type
of the man of the sea an ideal model
for an artist

vxe had been enjoying a short in-
  termission when crack-crack
-crack came from the chairmans
hammer

  tom said the chairman its a
long time since you told us a story
i have been reminded by your old

friend moses dingle here that there
is a story youve been promising to
relate for more than five years we
have a long evening before us and
if you feel like telling it tonight we
shall be mighty glad to hear you
what do you say

  a smile lit up toms grave features
as he replied mr chairman theres
a stiff northeaster blowing i have
just come in from the cliffs its
mighty cold outside and very com-
fortable in here by the fire so you
are welcome to my story to pass the
evening away

  boys strange as it may appear to
you i am more than willing to talk
in fact i am eager for it has fallen
to the lot of but few to experience
what i shall relate this evening you
may wonder what could have hap-
pened to make tom edivinn eager to
talk this last storm the loss of life
along the coast the rescue of this
man whom you call the grateful one
because of his undisguised gratitude
for saving his life-this is the cause
it has touched every fiber of my be-
ing and set my mind ablaze as you
know ive been scarcely outside of
padstow town yet i have known this
young man termed the grateful one
for many years he is now being
taken care of by my family

  boys how often weve said to
each other if anyone had ever come
back after being dead and would tell
us about it we would believe in the
hereafter it is as one who has re-
turned from the dead that i shall tell
my tale

  before im through with my
story you may think i am still af-
fected with my old complaint i do
not ask you to believe one word im
going to say-it would not make any
difference anyway im going to tell
 you my story because i feel compelled
to do so perhaps right down in my
heart i want to stir you up a bit
and make you look a little closer to
the confession of a madman



your compass and chart or think a
little differently from your custom

  boys i am going to refer to a
period of my life that i know will
surprize you out of respect to my
feelings you have never whispered of
it in my presence i refer to the ten
years of my insanity or more particu-
larly that period of my life between
the years of twenty-five and thirty-
five

  this coming christmas i shall be
sixty years old the record of my
life with the exception of those ten
years is fair and known to most of
you as you know i am not given to
talking about myself on this occa-
sion however i can not help myself
as the tale concerns myself only i
can say honestly and fearlessly with-
out fear of contradiction that outside
of those ten years of incarceration in
the bodmin asylum i never cherished
an evil thought against my fellow
men why is it that a strong and ro-
bust man with fifty years of unblem-
ished life to his credit should have
sandwiched into it ten such years and
yet not be conscious of a single act
or a moment of its time

  from what i have learned from
the testimony of others i went insane
without a moments warning and
when i came out of it i did so just as
quickly at the moment they said
my reason had returned i felt as if
some indignity had been put upon my
person i said to the professor  why
is it i have been called to pass
through this ordeal i feel as if ive
been imposed upon he replied
my dear sir you have had a disease
our treatment has rid you of it you
are now restored to your wonted
health and strength

  i said very quietly to the pro-
fessor im certain that you have had
a terrible time with me and i am
grateful for the care you have given
me but your treatment has had no
part or place in the return of my rea-
son

  boys i was born and raised in
this little town some of you have
known me since i was a youth i went
with you to the penny-a-week school
i passed some of you a little in edu-
cation through the kindness of the
honorable mr brune i spent one
year with liis boys under their private
tutor i attended the sunday school
bible class and all the preaching
services my boyhood was clean and
ive heard manly my young man-
hood was virtuous the energies of
youth were conserved i was as
sound physically and mentally as any
man that ever stood in a pair of shoes
i speak plainly to show there were
not the grosserrors of youth and ig-
norance whereby my future might
have been undermined and weak-
ened

  when i reached my twenty-fifth
year-a point that marked an epoch
in my life-my mind was as clear as
the noonday sun the blood in my
veins tingled with health i felt as
strong as a young bull life was
sweet i loved my fellow man the ap-
peal of want hurt me the cry of help
pierced my heart like a knife i loved
my wife and children and they-
thank god-loved me in return work
was a pleasure and idleness distaste-
ful to me i loved the sea its jagged
cliffs fascinated me when the storm
was fiercest i was there for i could
not enjoy the genial comfort of my
home while the storm was raging a
great upheaving force ever prompted
me to help my fellow man in distress

  boys i have walked that dunebar
all hours of the night and day try-
ing to grasp the meaning of its
treacherous depths which have
sucked down so many precious lives
in its quicksands

  i know youll be surprized that
i am blowing my own horn my only
excuse is that ive not blown it very
much in the past many times i
tom edivinn your townsman and
comrade have gone out to that dime-


weird tales

bar and bent my knees over its ghast-
ly depths and unknown dead asking
god to accept the strength of my
limbs and the devotion of my heart
to consecrate me to the service of my
fellow men in saving them from its
depths and the jagged rocks i am
simple enough to believe that the
gigantic force which we call god
heard my prayer and desire

  the longest way around to a sick
neighbors cottage was my shortest
way home once only have i felt like
fighting and hurting my fellow man
one morning when i was out on the
cliffs scanning the sea with my tele-
scope my attention was drawn to the
dunbar i saw something sticking
out of the sand and i knew it was
not the topmast of a ship slowly be-
ing sucked down there was sea-weed
attached to it i could not make out
what it was so i went out to investi-
gate when i had removed the sea-
weed i gave a gasp of pain for there
stood revealed a mans arm sticking
out of the sand this is the
only instance i know of the dune-
bar ever giving up its dead on
the index finger was a gold ring
for a moment i was startled-
it looked as if it was being of-
fered me i dug out the body placed
it in my boat and brought it in

  when  reached our docks i came
alongside of a schooner lying there
she hailed from liverpool her cap-
tain a massive man looked over the
side and saw the corpse in my boat
ah you big landlubber he said
so thats what you do for a living
scraping sand for dead bodies a
low-down bodysnatcher why in
thunder dont you go to work

  well boys those words made me
feel as i had never felt before i
made my boat fast and went on the
quay where the schooner lay i said
capn step ashore a minute i want
to say a few words to you  he
jumped on the quay mighty quickly
i said capn my name is tom edi-

vinn take a walk for ten minutes
and enquire about me when you
come back if you dont take back
your words im going to ram them
back down your throat this is a
new business to me if i get started
i aint quite sure when i shall quit
he came over and glared into my
eyes our noses almost hit i said
you had better hurry along or i
shall withdraw the privilege at
that he smiled and replied you look
pretty good but i think i can go you
one better you had better take off
those sea-boots and your coat you
cant scrap with those things on i
suppose ill find out youre the best
man in port and the bully as well 

   tarnation i said youd bet-
ter hurry along im getting impa-
tient  

  well boys in about fifteen min-
utes he came back held out his hand
with a good-natured smile on his face
and said tom those words dont go
im sorry i said them put on your
boots and coat and lets have some
home-brewed ale

 there was nothing on the corpse
to identify it except some tattooing
on the right forearm a full-rigged
ship an anchor and the letters c m
i gained permission to retain the ring
on the inside was engraved from
mother to a m

  this ring i retained up to about
five years ago when i returned it to
the mother of the young man i had
dug out of the sands of the dunebar
i want you to remember this incident
for i shall refer to it again before i
am through with this story



 t oys i asked a while ago how is it
d that a strong robust man with
fifty years of unblemished life to his
credit should have sandwiched into
it ten such terrible years and yet not
be conscious of a single act or a mo-
ment of its time i feel now as i
felt when my reason returned-that
the confession of a madman



some indignity had been put upon my
person that i had been imposed upon
my whole being welled up in protest
here was i a young man thirty-five
years of age in the full vigor of life
with ten years literally stolen out of
it over which i-that is to say my
individuality-had absolutely no part
nor place not even the consciousness
of one solitary moment of its time

  if it had not been for the testi-
mony of my loved ones and the
growth and change i could so plain-
ly see in them i could not have be-
lieved that ten years of my life had
been passed in an insane asylum
what was i to do i had reasoning
powers and was analytically inclined
i was confronted with a blank wall-
an impassable gulf

  when i returned to the bosom of
my family my children around me
my wife placed her arms around my
neck and with tears streaming down
her cheeks said oh tom it has
been such a long wait

  i replied my dear i do not un-
derstand i know that something has
occurred i know there is a lapse and
even the sense of lapse is so indistinct
i can not in any way define it i sense
a seeming haze it has shape circum-
ference color and form yet i can not
express or define a single detail it
is something between this moment
and yesterday but you say that my
yesterday is to you ten years of lone-
liness waiting anxiety and untold
suffering

   my wife i continued i can as-
sure you to me it has been a very lit-
tle while-just a short nap perhaps i
ean best explain it as a dream and
a pretty dream it must have been for
i am sure there was no element of
nightmare in it 

  then i saw the lines of care and
sorrow her hair was streaked with
premature gray my little boy of five
was standing before me a robust lad
of fifteen my sweet baby girl of two
was now a splendid girl of twelve

with a wealth of rich brown hair fall-
ing to her waist i took them in my
arms and wept those were the tears
of a baffled man

    when alone in my bedroom i
studied my features in a mirror i
looked older then at thirty-five than
i do now at sixty some diabolical
change had taken place i removed
my clothes and examined my person
it was covered with scars braises and
contusions my limbs and body were
black green and blue

  my soul rebelled at what i saw
what cruelty what indignity shame
and injustice had been inflicted on
my person  i who had devoted every
breath within me to alleviate suffer-
ing and had used my strength to bat-
tle with the unreasoning sea to help
my fellow man had been dashed un-
mercifully on jagged rocks and reefs
i knew not of no galley slave had
been humiliated like this was this
indeed i who had been called by some
the lion-hearted every idealistic
thought within me cried out i walked
my room in anger i again felt that
i would like to fight just as i felt
when that captain called me a body-
snatcher

 a fter i had become used to my
surroundings and felt settled i
called on good old dr morely one of
the grandest men cornwall has pro-
duced i put the matter to him and
told him of my predicament he said
with all the compassion in his nature
my dear tom why bother about it
the indisputable fact remains you
have been insane there has been a
lapse in your memory of ten years
it is absolutely lost to you it is im-
possible for you while sane to ap-
prehend the state of your mind when
insane 

  boys this matter was always on
my mind yet i confided in no one
for i did not want my problem to be-
come a theme for idle tongues and
gossip


weird

tales

  well i took tip ray life at thirty-
five where i had left it off at twenty-
five my mind was as sound as a
bell but my body was in a fearful
state mv limbs were like props un-
der me the strength of my arms was
gone and the elasticity of my muscles
missing i felt as if i owed someone
-or it-a good licking for misusing
my property so

  i was reminded of old mother
jones who went to plymouth to spend
a month with her daughter she left
her cottage spick and span every-
thing in order everything in its place
tramps took possession in her ab-
sence when mother jones came
back the bed was in disorder thn car-
pets ruffled and the floor dirty-dis-
order filth and neglect everywhere
i felt shocked just like mother jones
when she realized how her home had
been desecrated it took me a year to
patch up my body and restore it to its
previous condition thank god i suc-
ceeded

  at this point crack went the ham-
mer of the chairman and there was
an intermission of a few minutes
tom looked at me and said  stran-
ger i see that you are taking notes of
my story well ill finish my tale
if you think it is of sufficient interest
you may publish it to the world

  the waitresses were busy for a few
minutes then tom continued

  boys what proof have i that i
am in your midst tonight telling you
my story my confession thats the
problem i have had to work out ex-
istence consciousness love harmony
spirit power knowledge are ever-
lastingly existent their laws are
never for one instant inactive i
know that i exist because the knowl-
edge that i exist is the proof of my
existence

  reasoning along those lines that
my knowledge of existence had no
part in what took place at the asy-
lum i was forced to the con-
clusion that if my identity my knowl-

edge of self was not at the bodmin
asylum during those ten years of so-
callcd insanity it was simply some-
where else



toys one beautiful moonlight
night i took my boat and fishing
tackle and went out to the dunebar
after setting my lines i sat down and
mused  many things then i gave
a start when my ten years of oblivion
were brought to mind i sat up
stiff with the thought that my
problems solution was in my own
mind and not in someones else i be-
gan to think about the lecturer that
paid this town a visit he told us
about our objective and subjective
minds now i dont pretend to know
much about this but it was made
plain to my understanding before i
had been long at the dunebar that
whatever the objective mind experi-
enced in its daily routine was record-
ed somewhere in our own selves-call
it subjective mind if you will it could
never be lost or annihilated though
we might lose all consciousness of it
for many years maybe a lifetime i
clapped my hands with pure joy when
i understood this then i tried to
lose all sense of my surroundings
the gentle swish of the water playing
on the edge of the dunebar became as
distant music after a while i seemed
to be looking at a large volume of dis-
tant haze mist or cloudlike sub-
stance this was slowly drawing to-
ward me as it drew close i could dis-
tinguish indistinct forms and color-
not unlike a picture out of focus i
felt that if it came any nearer i
should be swallowed up or enshrouded
in it a cell-like something opened
in my mentality-instantly my mind
became flooded with understanding
i was as one in an audience watching
the projecting on the screen of a story
in which i was the principal actor
as each scene was unfolded i knew


the confession of a madman



absolutely what the next scene would
be

    i saw a stone cottage with a straw-
thatched roof having a center en-
trance for two families on one side
lived a childless couple their only
child had died and was buried in the
churchyard near by the mother gath-
ers some flowers from the little front
garden and visits the flower-kept
grave she returns to her home takes
out her childs clothes from a bureau
drawer and kisses them affectionately
while tears roll down her cheeks she
prays to be blest with another child

  on the other side of the cottage
lives a widow with three children a
small boy and girl and a grown son
named heney a fine strapping young
man who follows the sea as able sea-
man his ship is docked in the ad-
joining port and they are expecting
him home the widow looks often
out of the small four-paned window
and then at the cook-stove the table
is laid for the expected visitor

    the little boy and girl at the front
garden give a cry of delight and rush
to meet their big sailor brother there
is a happy gathering as they sit
around the table heney fondles the
little ones and produces some pres-
ents the widow looking very seri-
ous comes to heney places her arms
around his neck and shoulders and
says my son your father lost his life
at sea wont you give it up and stay
home and live with us heney re-
plies earnestly mother dear i like
my dad am cut out for the sea-i
too expect to find a watery grave 

  boys far more quickly than im
telling you the action of these two
families was unfolded to my appre-
hension yet there was no sense of
hurry-every incident was properly
punctuated with comma colon semi-
colon and period the mental atmos-
phere and inner workings of these
homes were fully understood with
the passing of time the childless

couples prayers are about to be an-
swered

  now my boys and friends con-
tinued tom i am coming to the
great secret that baffled all my en-
quiry for years-and to me the most
wonderful experience that could un-
fold to the consciousness of man

       the morning of that fateful
day when padstow town
mourned for tom edivinn their
townsman-that is to say the morn-
ing of the day i was judged
insane and committed to the bod-
min asylum-i went out to gull
rock while j was there a ship
signaled for a pilot i boarded
her and brought her in when my
days work was done i never felt
better in my life we have our
gloomy days as well as our bright
days and this day was exceptionally
bright i returned to my home with
a song in my heart when the supper
was over and the things cleared away
my wife came and gave me a kiss and
said  tom the children and i are go-
ing to sing for you to comfort your
great big heart all right said i
sitting back in my easy chair and
lighting my pipe

    she sat at the organ and the chil-
dren stood at each side of her she
sang a number of songs then she
sang nearer mrj god to thee with
its opening strains came a warm mel-
low feeling in my bosom as she con-
tinued to sing i felt it stealing
through my entire person i felt the
blood quicken in my veins-my chest
seemed to expand with glorious fire
a great light seemed suddenly to have
become ignited in me-joy and love
filled my soul

  the lamp on the organ seemed
magnified a thousandfold it was a
living brilliancy it enveloped their
persons their forms seemed spiritual-
ized and resplendent in their beauty
i tom edivinn big rough and
clumsy felt like a little child-then


weird tales

like a lightning bolt out of a clear sky
i was seized with a sudden pain in
my head and heart  sprang from
my seat to go toward my wife i said
brokenly mary i said i-dont-

feel-i-i- then i fell my head

striking the edge of a chair then
came an utter blank

  up to this point nothing had been
added to what i already knew-
though not a single incident or emo-
tion had been omitted i experienced
the entire day over again yet it was
as one apart from it that i witnessed
what occurred i saw the fearful
anguish of my beloved little family
around my prostrate form then i
was startled to see the skulking hid-
eous form of a hunchback in a corner
of the room looking with a leer of
expectancy though i knew what
was about to follow as a third party
apparently i simply marveled at
what i saw from the top of my
head to the soles of my feet a some-
thing left my body and remained sta-
tionary just above my head it was
not unlike steam rising from a hot
cloth i saw a look of devilish glee
stealing into the horrible features of
that thing in the corner in a few
seconds i saw my complete form sus-
pended in the air rigid and in line
with my body and then-marvel
of marvels-i saw my great some
call it astral form contracting with-
in itself with a slight inward rolling
movement until it assumed the per-
fect size shape and form of a babe
i experienced a thrill and emotion an
exquisite vibration of ecstasy that i
have not language to express in-
stantly the hunchback came between
my infant form and the prostrate
body and spread himself over it as
my form had been exhaled his form
was inhaled or absorbed he disap-
peared as his actions for ten years
while occupying my body were not a
part of my consciousness i was forced
to learn from other sources what oc-
curred

  while i was seeing with my ob-
jective sense all that occurred i was
realizing the unspeakable joy of an
infant with the shrinking or dimin-
ishing of my six feet three inches of
form my gross sinful nature shrank
with it until it became so minute it
was lost to consciousness-i was a
pure babe

  in and of ourselves we can not
prove we were ever infants or were
ever born memory takes us back to
a very early period of our life and
then ceases-there is a gulf between
the beginning of memory and the
birth of our present existence and we
are forced to rely on the testimony of
others but how different with me
your humble townsman i sensed
and enjoyed all that took place dur-
ing this period of infancy there
was no sense of time my family was
forgotten for the four walls of my
home disappeared my infant form
was surrounded with myriads of other
babe forms some more and some less
developed than my own luxuriating
in billows of downy clouds accom-
panied with the sweetest music mortal
ever heard then my infant form was
released from its companions

  infinitesimally i sensed a feeling
of fatigue then i lapsed into a state
of restful peace from which i evolved
to a consciousness of new objects and
surroundings-i was a babe at my
mothers bosom in the straw-thatched
cottage



at the cottage there is great re-
joicing ileney the sailor is
home for a visit and he is fascinated
with my baby self he enjoys fond-
ling the babe whom he has dubbed
sonny my parents and his family
marvel at his great love for the little
one whenever he is away from
home every letter enquires for little
sonny

  naturally and quickly i saw the
unfoldment from infancy to child-
the confession of a madman



hood then from childhood to boy-
hood i was thrilled when heney
wrote that he had bought sonnys
first suit of clothes-a velvet sailor
suit with gold buttons i with his
young brother and sister rushed
down the lane to meet him on his mo-
mentous visit he carried a bundle
and in it was my first suit of boys
clothes

  he played and romped with us
to me he was the great big man of the
sea on every visit he spent all his
time with us children i being the
smallest he gave me the most atten-
tion with childish awe i listened to
his tales of the sea hand in hand
we would wander to the cliffs to view
the passing ships and watch the
humble fishermen and sea birds

  i was never very robust though
i was perfectly happy and knew noth-
ing of pain or discomfort this caused
them to be more thoughtful loving
and kind

  at this point tom stopped his nar-
rative for a moment then looked
around the room and continued

  boys i must cut my story short
for it would take me a week to tell
you of the joys hopes and desires of
those glorious ten years of my life
experiencing again the throbs im-
pulses and inspirations of childhood
from the limitless depths of my sub-
conscious mind an idea would well
up my objective mind would grasp it
and put it into practise i built a
ship that heney thought was nothing
less than a marvel in detail when i
had finished it i rushed to my parents
crying i did it i did it to my
young and formative objective sense
it was absolutely new and original
yet every thought expressed in this
piece of work was learned here in our
own shipyards i mention this as one
of the thousand things i experienced
-i can only touch upon a few

  when i was between nine and ten
years old a birthday party was

planned for heney when he came
home for his vacation a mysterious
visit had been made to a near-by
town a gold signet ring had been
purchased and on the evening of
heney si home-coming everything was
ready for the celebration a jolly lot
of villagers were assembled after
the presentation and the drinking of
everybodys health the fiddler start-
ed up and young and old joined in
the dance

  one day heney and i paid a visit
to the old parish churchyard we sat
in front of an old moss-covered head-
stone trying to decipher the sunken
letters we cleared away the moss
and dirt and discovered a verse
heney prompted me to copy it into
my schoolbook-i also memorized
every word it read

here lies the remains of hyrum may
who dug the graves from day to day

at last he could not dig no more

for want of breath he died for sure

his work is finished and well done

he liked his ale and a little rum

hes done his best his whole life through
paid his debts was honest and true

  then we visited my little broth-
ers grave which had not been neg-
lected during the past years i
turned to heney and said heney
they have buried my little brothers
body in there i pointed to the
grave where is he now heney
looked at me in surprize and shook
his head i then looked him full in
the eyes and said with a smile on my
lips in a little while daddy and
mommy will put my body in there
too-but i shall be somewhere else

  time and again during my tenth
year as sonny i was dimly conscious
of my former stature as a man to
my immature boyhood mind it ap-
peared to me as a state i would attain
to not already realized some months
before my tenth birthday i was con-
scious i should leave my parents and
loving friends through the gateway


weird

tales

called death-yet death itself had no
terrors as the months passed i
gradually becomc weaker though i
experienced no shadow of pain

  a shadow fell over the two homes
in the cottage for i had ceased to
leave my room i sat the time away
in a large elbow chair within reach
were my boats and other things i
prized the widow and her children
and my parents were present i
turned to heney and said gently
heney please play your music and
sing me a song of the sea heney al-
most choking with grief got his con-
certina smiling through his tears
he sang the desired song i saw a
spiritual halo cover my features and
the eyes take on additional light as
my boyish mind formed the powerful
body of my former and present self
standing in the room then i held out
my hands to the figure of my imagi-
nation they said good-night then the
cottage was wrapped in darkness

  my last birthday came as sonny
and the hour of my departure was at
hand i saw myself  soft pillows
i looked lovingly into the eyes of my
dear ones i looked lingeringly at my
boats and ships then my eyes wan-
dered to my best piece of work-the
ship and stand set on a small table i
smiled and beckoned heney to me i
whispered to him did it i did it 
heney took my frail body in his arms
and smiled on me through his tears
i closed my eyes with one hand on
my boats heney whispered to the
others sonny is going on a long
cruise-his little boat is going to
founder  i felt too tired to open my
eyes but i smiled and said dear
heney-i shall not founder-they are
all waiting for me then i fell
asleep my spirit passed my con-
ciousness of another ten years of
childhood was sealed in my subcon-
scious mind they called it death 



jombades ive reached the end of

   my confession it took me eight
long years to make the discovery of
my whereabouts during those ten
years for nine years the great se-
cret was locked in my bosom i dared
not make it known even to my fam-
ily for they would surely think i was
losing my reason again but the
knowledge that i was never for a mo-
ment insane filled me with an un-
speakable joy the widow and her
young children my parents and
heney were ever bright and burn-
ing in consciousness

 when i awoke to my surround-
ings in the bodmin asylum i was in
a stupor of thought for some time-
then my thoughts became normal it
seemed as if i had awakened in the
morning following a night of sleep-
that the night before i had fallen and
struck my little girls chair and hurt
my head when my wife said oh
tom it has been such a long wait  
it was simply all latin to me i did
not know but that she had been sleep-
ing by my side as usual during the
preceding night

  where the cottage was located 
had no means of knowing then
came the morning of my discovery of
something sticking out of the dune-
bar under ordinary conditions i
would not have paid any particular
attention to it but i was filled with a
burning curiosity-i was impelled to
go and examine that something stick-
ing out of the sand when i re-
moved the seaweed as ive already
stated i gave a gasp of pain for
there stood revealed a mans arm
sticking out of the sand on the in-
dex finger was a gold ring for a
moment i was startled for it looked
as if it was being offered me then i
recognized its peculiarity it being a
gold signet ring i hastily got my
cockle-snovel from my boat and dug
the body out from some cause i
the confession of a madman



know nothing about the body was in
perfect condition i got some water
and washed the sand and slime from
his face then i stood up and looked
the body over great god i
thought my heart would burst for i
was looking at my childhood friend
my beloved hemyj i fell almost
fainting to my knees by his side-i
wept like a child	

  when that liverpool captain
looked over the gunwale of his ship
and saw the corpse in my boat and
said  ah you big landlubber so
thats what you do for a living scrap-
ing sand for dead bodies-a low-down
bodysnatcher -had we started to
fight i am almost sure i should have
killed him

  i relieved the parish of the fu-
neral expenses someone said it was
one of my peculiar notions the
flowers on his grave are not allowed to
die as all know my family and i
visit the grave often

  two years after the burial of
heney my boy visited the city of
truro while there he bought an
album of pictures of the unique spots
of the cornish coast and villages in
looking over it i discovered a good
picture of the straw-thatched cottage
and underneath a description of its
location it is less than seventy-five
miles from here not far from truro

  the following week i started out
for a visit to the cottage great was
my emotion when the widow now a
sweet old lady opened the door in
answer to my knock i spent one
hour with her it was taken up in
praising her children lingeringly
she dwelt on heney and his great love
for sonny heneys ship she said had
been lost with all hands on board some
two years before

  when i told her of the finding
of his body and presented her with
his signet ring she bathed my horny
hands with her tears while she was
yet speaking her daughter a woman

of thirty married and a mother
came in with her brother a fine man-
ly boy of thirty-three years now the
sole support of his widowed mother
i dared not tell them i was sonny
and their childhood companion

  i enquired about the family next
door together we went in to see
them they were living in the mem-
ory of their two beloved children
with pride they pointed to the life-
size crayon portrait of sonny beau-
tifully framed on the wall they
showed me his school books here i
read again the epitaph of hyrum
may every word of which i had long
ago committed to memory whfin
they- pointed to sonnys best piece of
work a full-rigged ship my heart
nearly overflowed i murmured i-
did it-i-did it  they were
thankful that sonny had come in an-
swer to piaycr and filled a void in
their hearts for ten sweet years i
longed to tell them all but my lips
were sealed	

  i had to hasten my departure
for strong man though i am emotion
was tearing my heart apart on my
way home i visited the old church-
yard i sat in front of hyrum mays
headstone and pondered the follow-
ing week they all visited padstow and
heneys flower-kept grave

  during toms story the silence was
so intense one could almost have
heard a pin drop every eye was
fixed upon him he stood up and
looked around into the eyes of his
listeners his great figure seemed to
fill and round out his chest heaved
with inward emotion and his eyes
flashed with joy and inspiration he
said in thunderous tones

  boys he whom you have termed
the grateful one whom i rescued
from the death-jaws of the points and
dunebar is heneys brother-the
widows only support and sonnys
childhood companion and playmate

a mystery serial

by frank a mochnant

the story so far

james geraldton whose father is manager of a
mine in the heart of australia has an uncle
reported drowned in the sinking of the titanic
the uncles death brings prosperity to the family
james goes to technical school and is completing
his course at the mine

  the lode in the old mine peters out the mine is
abandoned and landslips completely close it up
but strange clouds with an odor as from a zinc
plant are seen over the old mine by superstitious
miners phantom whisperings are heard and the
mine gets the reputation of being haunted then
in the fading light of a winter afternoon a group
of miners is terrified by seeing a form which
glides into the ruins and disappears



i had been on afternoon shift
and a few minutes past midnight
had left the cage and was strid-
ing out for home when i became
aware of agitated voices i turned
my head and saw dim shadows mov-
ing to and fro in the vicinity of my
fathers office with a vague sense
of uneasiness i approached the door
and first one and then another of a
scared-looking group made way for
me my fathers old clerk lay mo-
tionless on the floor a glance how-
ever satisfied me that lie was not
dead indeed almost as i entered he
began to come round but he did not
recover completely and terror was
stamped on his waking features

  suddenly he cried out what did
he come to me for what did he
come to me for then he began to
rave incoherently in his delirium
fragments of his own concerns became
inextricably entangled with office
matters full consciousness appeared
to return for a moment only and in
that instant he threw himself up in a
sitting posture and with an expres-
sion as of concentrated horror peered
past us all toward the open doorway

    

several of the men involuntarily drew
back into the room

  i stooped with the idea of assisting
him back into the capacious chair
from which he had evidently fallen
and he said with a sort of gasp or sob
after each word   he stood there just
as though he had been alive

  at least four voices blended in an
awe-struck exclamation of the single
word ghost

  the old clerk shuddered and sank
back into his former position one
of the men placed a thick coat under
his head and he began to breathe
heavily he had fallen into a natural
but exhausted sleep

  i rang up the nearest cab proprie-
tor and requested that a conveyance
be sent immediately then i turned
again to the men all of whom still
lingered in the office i hoped to get
a little light on the extraordinary
turn of events that had been responsi-
ble for our assembling at all at that
hour and under such strange circum-
stances they were stout-hearted
fellows but were utterly dazed all
they could tell me was that they had
heard a piercing scream from the di-
rection of the room and had rushed
from different parts of the surface
works in fact like myself they were
just at the end of their shift one or
two others on their way to work had
stopped for a minute or two to see
what was occurring but could not re-
main several of the men had arrived
at the office together only to find sad-
ler alone and insensible as i had seen
him and not in the more natural
sleep in which he lay now
the derelict mine



  i glanced over the table to see what
had kept the clerk so late and found
that he had been engaged in corre-
spondence and other matters that had
accumulated through the absence of
one of our juniors who was down with
typhoid

  then came the rumble of wheels
and one of the men and i conveyed
the still sleeping sadler safely to his
home it was with a feeling of im-
mense relief that i handed him over
to the care of his capable housekeeper

since my search over the old mine
premises i had been on better
terms with my father and so over the
breakfast table in the morning i re-
lated the seizure that had taken his
clerk i rose really for the purpose
for though i was changing shift that
day and would not be due at the
mines till the following morping i
should certainly not after night shift
have risen till close upon lunch time

  it was then i learned that my
father had been aware of the ghost
rumors

  these absurd ghost stories must
have affected him said he what
do you make of them yourself

  there was a trace of anxiety in his
voice i was startled

  there is anything but a ghost at
the bottom of it  i replied decisively

  no i am afraid it is not a ghost
he agreed cryptically

  you are afraid not

  i suppose i looked my astonish-
ment my father seemed uneasy al-
most worried as he answered sad-
lers spectral friend paid a former
visit to the office and possessed him-
self of a document which under
very peculiar circumstances certain-
ly would spell blue ruin for the lot
of us

  my father paused and then contin-
ued reflectively as if communing with
himself it was only by chance that
i discovered the loss the safe had
been opened and carefully locked

again in consequence of these rumors
i went to dig out a plan of the old
mine but it with the other document
was gone it was my private safe
and i alone have a key

  anything else missing

  nothing even fifty gold sov-
ereigns in the same drawer were left
intact in the whole safe there was
nothing to indicate that it had been
disturbed

  when could the papers hate been
stolen

  sometime in the last fortnight
said my father promptly it is just
about two weeks since i opened the
drawer and slipped in some gold i
recounted the coins at the time and
i distinctly remember seeing the
papers  

  its curious the sovereigns not
being touched i mused for any-
one nowadays might be tempted to
pick up a sovereign as a sort of curio
however did you manage to collect
fifty

  my father did not heed my query
but went on meditatively taking his
cue from the first part of my remark

  yes it is strange i could almost
wish that the coins had gone too the
funny part is that the plans can be of
no use to anybody and the document
except under the impossible circum-
stances ive hinted might as well be
destroyed indeed ive intended to
do so

  then i expressed the question that
had been clamoring in my head for
some minutes   what would the cir-
cumstances be

  my father laughed uneasily as he
replied well then if the only uncle
you ever had should happen to revisit
the glimpses of the moon which is
as euclid would have it absurd see-
ing that he went down with the ti-
tanic  

  have you informed the police
i asked

  better not the thief willfind
the document worthless and destroy


weird tales

 it as no donbt he has done before
 this

   my father seemed to have regained
 his composure and was calmly smok-
 ing his pipe over a final cup of coffee
 when my mother came in with a gay
 excuse me gentlemen im late this
 morning as usual

  then came in martha with my
mothers steaming porridge and we
conversed on general topics then if
i still remember the sequence of
events on that particular morning
the telephone bell rang my father
stretched round and caught up a port-
able receiver which rested on a side-
board

   hello

  c 

   yes mr geraldton speaking

 ff

  what dying you say non-
sense ill come at once

   click the receiver was replaced on
 the instrument and the whole re-
 turned to the sideboard and my
 father stood pale and erect he spoke
 with evidence of a strain

   poor old sadlers dying i am
 going round now on my way to the
 office

   after he had gpne i tumbled back
 into bed and slept till well past noon
 when i dressed lunched and set off
 for myrtles

   slightly out of my way however
 was sadlers cottage and as i neared
 his street i determined to call and at
 least inquire concerning him his
 housekeeper admitted me she had
 always been somewhat solemn in ap-
 pearance but now her whole bearing
 reflected the hopelessness of poor sad-
 lers case

   hes going fast was her greet-
 ing

   she led the way into the sick mans
 room and as my eyes fell upon the
 bed i saw that the body of the aged
 clerk was already sinking into its last
 sleep i walked round the bed and
 gazed down at the comatose form for

a few minutes then with a certain
feeling of depression which such
scenes inevitably inspire i passed out
into the passage followed by the
housekeeper

  poor old chap said i he
must have had a shock did he not
come to himself at all mrs hodson

  he was conscious for awhile this
morning when he insisted on sending
for mr geraldton-your father re-
plied the woman he is all right
now sir i hope she added with
seeming irrelevance

  all right who i demanded
startled

  mr geraldton you know

  my father and in look and
tone i must have exhausted all the
interrogatives

  yes he went in to see sadler and
after a moment closed the door and
it was half an hour by the clock be-
fore he came out and when he did he
was white as a sheet and dazed-like
i spoke to him but he did not answer
then he put his hand to his head
and stumbled toward the front door
i asked him was he ill but he never
seemed to see me and presently flung
open the door and walked swiftly
into the street he looked awfully
bad though i went back to sadler
but he was dozing off and has not
spoken since

  a few more words with mrs hod-
son and i was walking reflectively on
my way the womans reference to
my father made me uneasy i de-
bated within myself for a moment
whether i should return home and
await his arrival at the evening meal
but i concluded that had my father
been seriously ill we should have been
informed of it it was natural i
argued that the pater should feel the
passing of a trusted servant of half
a lifetime yet for the remainder of
the day i fell into fits of abstraction
from which myrtle more than once
laughingly aroused me
the derelict mine



it was not a voice exactly yet some-
thing within me seemed to press
the query does a trouble of that
sort tragic enough but more or less
outside make people turn suddenly
ill especially people of my fathers
character was there possibly a sub-
tler cause for his unwonted display
of feeling

  it was  or thereabouts and i
was striding home under a setting
moon it may have been that my
nerves were not quite up to their
standard perhaps the events of the
past few weeks had affected me de-
spite myself certain it was that i
felt for the first time a vague sense
of creepiness as i stepped across the
old mine precincts

  i observed as i had not done before
how grotesque the ruins appeared in
the light of the early but now western
moon long shadows trailed in weird
shapes behind things i was reflect-
ing that a dark night would be pref-
erable when at the moment a heavy
cloud slid over the diminishing disk
the sudden and prevailing gloom
synchronizing with my thought gave
me a queer start everything now
seemed dull and indefinite and i was
nearing the timbers which were still
stacked by the pathway then i
heard a sound from a little distance
in front of me as of a twig broken
by a step a figure darted from
the neighborhood of the timber and
rushed upon me with terrifying vio-
lence before i could recover from
my astonishment i was borne heavily
to the ground a hand gripped my
throat and another my right arm as
in a vise a knee was pressed against
my stomach i believed that i was at
the mercy of a dangerous maniac and
gave myself up for lost

  you infernal scoundrel where is
that receipt   

  as these words vibrated through
my ears in familiar tones which even
intense rage could not disguise i
thought for a moment that i had gone

mad myself with a desperate and
sudden movement i swept my left
hand across my chest and seized the
wrist that moved above it andcried
in amazement father

  in a second the figure was helping
me to my feet and it was saying
jim you how deuced thin
youve grown whatever are you
doing here oh myrtle of course
and even at that astounding moment
i could not fail to notice a certain
bitterness in his tone

  but whatever is the trouble i
urged

  we could scarcely see each other
in the almost negligible light of the
stars but we moved as by a common
impulse to the heap of timbers and
my father replied in a peculiarly hol-
low voice the impossible has hap-
pened your uncle has returned and
is living somewhere on this mine
old sadler saw him at the office last
night

  but sadler may have had an illu-
sion or something

   so i thought and so i hoped but
i saw him myself and followed him
here not an hour ago   said my father
emphatically

  suddenly he caught me by the arm
again in a grip hardly less fierce than
the last and whispered in a sort of
awed and suppressed excitement
look

  i turned and there below us was
the light i had seen weeks before
my father then moved cautiously in
its direction

  its no good father it would
vanish before we could reach it
however nothing would satisfy
him but to crawl down the slope and
pry among the ruins as i had done
after that elusive light and it disap-
peared when we were within a few
feet of it but this time peal on peal
of blood-curdling and mocking laugh-
ter rang out all around us i felt my
cheek blanch my father tore wildly
about and stumbled now over this


weird tales

  

piece of debris now over that in a
frenzy of petulance and anger it
was long past midnight before he
calmed down a little and we walked
home together

  as we neared our gate he said
its war to the death between him
and me my boy and in this particu-
lar war game he has all the guns
whatever is it all about
youll know all too soon boy but
he is an unscrupulous scoundrel and
it is ruin for me if i do not let the
company in

  then he squared his shoulders and
threw his head back and snapped out
so you see its ruin

  i was somehow vaguely proud of
him at that moment the next we
turned in



in-rom that time my father never re-

	covered his wonted buoyancy
within the next few weeks he was
himself looking not unlike a ghost
he certainly was only the ghost of his
former self and his eyes wore a wild
haunted expression

  my mother did not at first appear
to notice it but one morning at break-
fast she exclaimed why harry
what have you been doing to your-
self you look positively ill

  my father merely laughed but
alas it was but a ghost of his robust
laugh

  what is the matter with you
my mother persisted

  oh i am just run down a bit
he answered wearily the new
clerk has not got into things yet

  my mother seemed reassured but
an evening or so later when we were
alone she said what can be the mat-
ter with your father is anything
wrong at the mine

  i am no actor and i fear that my
answer was not quite free from trace
of my own anxiety

  oh no everything is tip-top i
said he will be all right directly

deuced strain running a big concern
like that you know

  then as much as anything to pre-
vent her from pressing me further i
blurted out what i had been trying
to make up my mind to say for
months

  say mother why dont you call
on mrs clysdale it is absurd my
being engaged to myrtle and your
not receiving her properly the pa-
ter wont have her here and you
never call

  it is certainly absurd your being
engaged to myrtle said my mother
and a faint flush crept over her face
this was a kind of smartness i had
not formerly observed in her

now look here mother what is
this mystery surrounding myrtle 
why cant you call on her mother
again this peculiar smartness and
it was startling

  because she has been dead eight-
een years

  but the moment the words were
out my mother looked confused and
i believe almost literally bit her
tongue she had obviously been
tempted to say more than she in-
tended

  i considered a moment then ejacu-
lated eighteen years ago then
myrtle was only two

  my mother nodded assent

  who is mrs clysdale

    an old widow nurse who adopted
her

  my head swam but i shot out one
more question

     who is her father   

 her father why- then

desperately oh hes dead too

  i paced the room for a few minutes
and i saw that my mother was look-
ing pale and scared at last i said
as quietly as i could does myrtle
know about this amiable arrange-
ment   

  my mother hardly more than whis-
pered no
the derelict mine



  what is myrtles real name any-
way   

  but my mother just repeated
real name and then came a half
hysterical cry oh and she left
the room weeping and i was not able
again to get her to speak of myrtle

  i went about that day in a sort of
bad dream i could only infer one
thing from my mothers attitude that
myrtle was a nameless waif the
revelation obsessed and haunted me
i had inherited rigid ideas but that
evening as i dressed i muttered to
myself what of it myrtle is myr-
tle anyway

  from that time my affection for
her was more ardent than ever

my father was breaking up he
aged visibly in a few weeks
and now spent most of his evenings
alone in his office his nerves seemed
shattered and i began to entertain
grave fears concerning the issue

  i had just finished tea one evening
it had been a depressing meal my
mother and i had exchanged but
few words in a detached way i have
often wondered since whether we may
each have had a sense of impending
disaster i drew up a big chair for
my mother before a belated october
fire it was not only a cold night but
it was inclined to rain my mother
sat with some fancy work in her lap
and i was standing for a moment on
the hearth finishing a cigarette when
the telephone bell rang at the instru-
ment in my fathers study my
mother started as from a revery and
i strode across to the receiver it
was a direct line to the office

  it was a brief conversation and ran
thus

  that you jim

  hello father yes

  meet me down at the cross roads
at once better not say anything
about it

  before i could reply i heard the
replacing of the receiver at the other
end of the wire

  as i moved away from the instru-
ment my mother met me at the door
with a nervous anxious expression on
her face

  anything the matter

  oh no i am wanted at the
mine  

  it was father ringing up was
he all right

     of course hes all right mother  
i donned my greatcoat and went
out i was puzzled nevertheless for
the cross roads were some distance
from the town it nlay have been the
dismal night that affected me but i
had not reached the gate before i re-
turned for my heavy stick it oc-
curred to me that my father would
propose another visit to the old mine-
field which lay not far beyond our
appointed rendezvous i walked
briskly and was soon in the vicinity
of our own mine which i had to pass
then happening to glance up i saw
that the light in my fathers office
had not been switched off and i con-
cluded that he had not yet started to
meet me i determined therefore to
make the slight detour that would
probably save me from a long wait
in the damp and cold

  when i reached the office i found
the door locked and was about to
hurry off supposing that my father
had left and that i might overtake
him but the thought flashed into my
mind that it was a strange thing he
had not switched off the light this
made me go round to the window at
the side and peer in my father was
sitting at his table but in a posture
that held me horror-stricken his
left arm hung down at the side of the
chair the other with a clenched
fist was stretched over the table and
his head was drooping on his breast
mechanically or perhaps in forlorn
hope i tapped on the pane but the
figure in the chair did not stir then


weird

tales

my eye was arrested by something on
the table just beyond his clenched
right hand it was in appearance
but a glass beaker about a quarter
full of water yet it sent a sort of
clairvoyant chill through my already
frozen blood and i determined to get
into the loom without raising the
alarm with but little difficulty i
opened the window and passing
quickly through closed it again on the
inside and pulled down the blind

  my father was dead but merely
placing my hand for a moment over
his heart i turned again my own
pounding within me with desperate
resolve a finger which i plunged
into the beaker i placed immediately
upon my tongue and my instinctive
fear of a few moments before was
confirmed but for a later and more
certain proof i took a test-tube from
a pigeonhole and obtained some of the
liquid from the beaker then cau-
tiously i opened the door and tossed
the remaining contents of the vessel
away and having rinsed it half filled
it from a tap outside the office and
replaced it upon the table i rang
up dr harris whom i knew my
father had visited occasionally both
in a professional and private capac-
ity i told the doctor briefly what
had occurred and he undertook to
bring the sergeant of police with him
this saved me the necessity of com-
municating with the station myself
i then went to the door of the office
and hailed a man who happened to be
passing on some errand

  is mr dalton about i in-
quired

  saw him just now in the engine
room something is up with the big
dynamo

  is foreman lane on shift

  yes

  well if you come across lane tell
him he is wanted at the office and
just slip back and tell mr dalton that
mr geraldton would like to see him
will you

  the man disappeared in the dark-
ness and within ten minutes lane
arrived at the office i merely mo-
tioned toward my fathers body for
a second or so i could not speak but
as lane seemed about to approach the
silent form i managed to say bet-
ter not touch anything lane

  the man stood looking down at my
father consternation written large on
every feature then in a choking
voice he blurted out anything to
do with the old mine sir

  i am afraid so lane i replied
solemnly then with a feeling of de-
fiance i could not myself quite under-
stand i added  it is the beginning of
the end of it

  did the ghost come again sir
and his teeth chattered

  i do not know lane i do not
think so but we must wait and see
what dr harris says

  dalton who had left the engine
room before my messenger returned
there to seek him came in now almost
immediately and i told him how i
had discovered my father lifeless in
his chair dalton was our electrical
engineer he bent over the lifeless
form then came toward me all sym-
pathy

  this is a terrible blow for you
mr geraldton and will be for the
whole mine and indeed the town
your father was popular all round
but he has been ill for some time
several of us have noticed it what-
ever could it have been and again
he moved toward the body in its
chair and i noticed that he glanced
at the beaker i noticed further that
he paled and cast a furtive glance at
me and remained silent

the headlamps of a motor flashed
down the road approaching the
mine and presently the car pulled up
below us and in a few minutes two
figures moved across the field of one
of our outer lights as they neared
the derelict mine



the office i advanced a pace or two to
meet them

  good evening doctor good eve-
ning sergeant i said in a voice as
steady as i could command

  the sergeant a tall keen but
genial man who had been associated
with my father in the local bowling
club nodded gravely to dalton and
lane and almost simultaneously ad-
dressed me in terms of quite unoffi-
cial sympathy

  dr harris tells me that mr ger-
aldton has been under him for some
time but this is fearfully sudden and
most distressing for you

  for several minutes he and the doc-
tor examined the body and i watched
them anxiously

  	 he must have been dead for some
hours exclaimed the officer sud-
denly

  three at least assented the doc-
tor solemnly

  hours i cried three hours

why- and i reeled almost

fainting against the table

  then in the blind instinct of pres-
ervation i did what i had never been
actor enough to have done in cool rea-
son and i am convinced that i there-
by prevented a post-mortem on my
fathers body and the untimely rev-
elation of a blot on the family
escutcheon i seized the beaker and
drank a couple of mouthfuls of the
contents and as it revived me i saw
instantly that my action had a pecu-
liar effect upon my companions the
sergeant sprang forward but too late
to xrevent my swallowing the water
the doctor paled for a moment but
i felt somehow that he was making
determined effort to keep his manner
under control he darted many fur-
tive and anxious glances in my direc-
tion however and it was not till some
minutes later and i had recovered
completely from my fainting turn
that i noticed an expression of relief
pass over his face with the excep-
tion of the curious glance that dalton

cast for a perceptible second upon the
beaker as he entered the room nei-
ther he nor lane had given the
slightest token of suspicion but dal-
tons face was a shade more serious
and his manner never so courteous as
he touched the sergeant on the arm
and turning his head slightly toward
my poor father said quietly shall
we get him home before shift
changes  lane can fetch a stretcher  

  the sergeant had been a trifle un-
nerved and assented mechanically
and lane was off like a shot

  the water in the beaker was re-
tained by the officer for analysis and
its innocent natureproved but i am
convinced that but for the diversion
caused by my momentary weakness a
post-mortem had been demanded as
it was dr harris report of death
due to heart failure was accepted i
have wondered if the doctor contin-
ued to suspect anything despite the
analysis of the contents of the beaker
i do not know but i myself analyzed
the solution that i had kept back in
the test-tube and i know that my
father was found dead in the first in-
stance with a beaker that contained
potassium cyanide at his hand i had
purposely left the water on my fath-
ers table hoping that it would di-
vert attention from the body and
claim an immediate examination it
occurred to me that the discovery of
the innocuous nature of the most ob-
viously suspicious fluid would lead
the official mind away from the idea
of suicide and thus an autopsy
which would have been almost certain
had the body been the single object
of interest might not be demanded

in regard to the days immediately
succeeding i have little to record
they were days naturally dark un-
der the pall of death but for me they
were days too intense with forebod-
ing and indeed as the sequel will
show they were soon to be eclipsed
by horror upon horror


weird tales

  the shock of my fathers death de-
spite all i could do had an alarm-
ing effect upon my mother and for
awhile i feared for her reason after
the funeral however i managed to
persuade her to leave the district for
an indefinite period of rest i ar-
ranged by wire for apartments at a
seaside resort near sydney it en-
tailed a long railway journey and it
was necessary that she should have a
companion to my astonishment she
asked for myrtle and it was settled
that myrtle should accompany her

  my fathers affairs were in a pecu-
liar condition his private account
at the bank was something less than
a hundred pounds and barely more
than sufficient to meet current liabili-
ties he held war bonds however to
the extent of five hundred pounds
his will was simple it made every-
thing over to my mother and appoint-
ed me her executor the furniture
was already in her name the house
belonged to the company and when
my mother left i had a week in which
to vacate the one thing that re-
lieved the financial position for my
mother was the fact that he had a
fully paid-up life insurance policy
for five thousand pounds it had been
an odd position for a reputedly
wealthy man i learned too from his
financial agent and intimate friend
mr finlayson that he had within
the last few months realized on es-
tates and shares valued at more than
seventy-five thousand pounds fin-
layson stated that my father had
seemed fearfully worried but had let
drop no hint concerning the use to
which he was putting so vast a sum



it was the second evening after the
departure of my mother and myr-
tle that i sat alone on the front
veranda of my old home on a small
table at my side and kept by the
weight of my tobacco pouch from
blowing away in the occasional puffs

of an early summer breeze was a tele-
gram from myrtle she and my moth-
er had arrived safely at their destina-
tion and my mother had stood the
journey well

  i sank back in my chair and gave
myself up to reflection i had that
afternoon arranged to lease a cottage
where i considered that with martha
as housekeeper i should be comfort-
able enough till my marriage which
i hoped would take place within the
year my course was all but com-
pleted my mother would i knew
never return permanently to the dis-
trict

  presently old toby a favorite black
cat of my fathers brushed several
times against my leg then sprang
upon my knees i stroked the sleek
body and the animal settled down
against my waistcoat and its deep
purr gradually grew fainter till the
low roar of the mines in the nearer
distance was the only sound percepti-
ble i became deeply engrossed in my
gloomy meditation i began to link
into a chain the peculiar incidents of
the last few months till the sense of
mystery became oppressive and a
nameless dread of some intangible evil
grew upon me at last my mind re-
verted to the evening of the tragedy i
remembered it was exactly a fortnight
back my mind had been absorbed
by matters of pressing moment but
now i was free to think or rather it
seemed compelled to think then
came back to me the scene in the
office and the sergeants voice came
again clear in my memory he must
have been dead several hours and
the doctor three at least

  something of the uncanny sensa-
tion that came over me then recurred
now dead hours when but minutes
before he had spoken to me over the
telephone demanding that i should
meet him at the cross roads what
could he have intended to do  what
made them think that he had been
dead so long of course they must
the derelict mine



have been mistaken my nerves had
certainly undergone a great strain
but a thought was beginning to haunt
me could he have spoken after
death and however irrelevant it
may appear i kept reminding myself
that the study telephone was connect-
ed directly with the office perhaps
vaguely i felt that it would be incom-
patible with the nature of a spirit to
call up exchange firmly i refused
to consider the spirit hypothesis

  but persisted an idea in my
brain harris and sergeant wil-
liams with their technical experience
could not make such an error concern-
ing the time that had elapsed since
death he must have been dead when
the ring came then i avowed
within myself it was someone else
who spoke but with the thought
i gripped the arms of my chair for
a new significance flashed upon me
with paralyzing effect if that mes-
sage came from anyone else it must
have been transmitted at my fathers
telephone with the corpse at the very
elbow of the speaker

  i was stunned with the full force
of this inference and it may have
been the next moment or it may have
been half an hour later but i was
suddenly aroused by the strange be-
havior of the cat which till that mo-
ment had been sleeping peacefully
he sprang on all fours upon my knee
his back arched and his hair bristling
to the tip of his tail and his eyes
wide and staring glowed in the elec-
tric light i thought for a moment that
a strange dog might have wandered
into the garden but i noted that his
head was not turned to the garden
he rather peered over my shoulder
as if trying to discern something
through the window at my back it
was the window of the room that had
been my fathers study

  whats up toby old chap i
said a little nervously i fear but
he only snarled then he went fly-
ing across the veranda as i sprang to

my feet the telephone bell had
rung it was only a momentary vi-
bration but unmistakable and my
fathers office had been locked up
since the day following the tragedy

  i could feel my heart beating vio-
lently as i clutchcd my chair then
the bell rang long and loud i dashed
into the house and into the room and
seized the receiver almost at the mo-
ment that the bell ceased ringing

  hello i hardly recognized my
own voice and my lips were parched

  that you jim meet me at the
cross iioads at once it was my
fathers voice to the last tone

 who the- i began with a

desperate effort at self-mastery but
even at the moment i could hear the
receiver being replaced at the other
end of the wire

  i stood for a few seconds in a state
of feverish excitement and irresolute
then i came to a sudden resolve to
follow up what promised to be a clue
merely waiting in my own room to
load a revolver which i slipped into
my pocket i hurried off straight for
the office on arrival i found it dark
and secured as i had last seen it
snatching a bunch of keys from my
pocket i flung the door open and
switched on the light but could find
not the slightest trace of a recent en-
trant i did not waste much time
however and having switched off the
light i withdrew and locked the door
again

  t was slipping my keys away when
a burly figure sprang out of the dark-
ness and growled what are you
after then as i looked up the man
recognized mo in the dim light and
the voice became apologetic oh i
beg your pardon sir but there was a
fellow fumbling at that door not
three minutes ago and when i went
up to him he made off i tried to
overtake him and just as i came back
i saw you and thought he must have
doubled round somehow


weird

tales

  the man had a coil of wire and one
or two small tools in his hand and
had evidently been working in the
vicinity i assured him that it was
all right and hurried along to the
main road again so someone had
been in the office i reflected-some-
one with a duplicate yale key

as i neared the cross roads i saw
a somewhat tall figure ahead of
me the head turned slightly at my
footsteps and a voice the facsimile
of my late fathers called out here
you are come and the figure
moved forward with a quick swinging
stride

  i would have run to catch up with
it but a couple of men were coming
up the road toward the township and
i did not want to arrest their atten-
tion by the time they had passed
the figure was out of sight but i could
hear the steps ahead and i walked
rapidly on presently the voice came
through the darkness apparently
some hundred yards or so on my left
and at almost right angles to the
road this way

  i did not hesitate but made the
best of my way over the uneven
ground blundering now and then
into a stunted shrub of salt bush i
had gone only some three hundred
yards when i saw the dim outline of
a ridge which i knew to be in the vi-
cinity and almost immediately a
faint light shone through a doorway
of a sort of dugout or humpy not
two chains in front of me i soon dis-
covered that the light was from a hur-
ricane lantern held by my strange
guide who on my approach merely
said here and disappeared with-
in the room

  i knew the place well enough-a
humpy occupied by an old-age pen-
sioner whom i had seen often though
casually and who lived inoffensively
here on the outskirt of the township
the ruins of the old mine were half
a mile farther on and across the main

road i entered the shack and found
the old man leaning against a rough
table upon which he had already
placed the lantern he was muffled
up about the throat as i had always
seen him and he had on a broad-
brimmed slouch hat he wore too
large tinted glasses- as was also his
custom in addition he had a thick
beard so little of his face was dis-
cernible he was obviously out of
breath and signed for me to wait a
moment before he could speak i took
the opportunity of looking round the
dugout it was just such a compart-
ment as one would expect the con-
tents were simple but sufficient be-
sides the table were several cooking
utensils a stretcher bed and a cool
safe knocked up from a packing case
and some bagging in the fireplace
avas a portable oven

  i had entertained no delusion from
my setting out the similarity of the
voice to my fathers could be ex-
plained only on the supposition that
it was my uncle who had spoken yet
though i had no means of knowing
anything of my uncles appearance
i could not somehow reconcile what
i was able to see of the apparently
weak and utterly undistinctive face
before me with the extraordinary per-
sonality and evil genius of the man
who had been my fathers lifelong
persecutor several who had seen the
ghost on the mine had stated that
the face itself was terrifying in the
extreme but of course they might
have imagined anything then i
realized how little of the features be-
fore me were actually perceptible
and i became convinced that the muf-
fler and hat to say nothing of the
glasses were worn with the purpose
of concealment it was just dawning
upon me that the head was unusually
large when the figure spoke ah the
voice again

  now are you prepared to come
with me down the old mine  that is
the question
the derelict mine



  the old mine i gasped why
how what for

  the feud between your father
and me is at an end and as the casus
belli took place before you were born
i bear you no malice so we can begin
square anyway i want the services
of a member of the family and a
man of nerve

  what do you know of my nerve
i put the question mechanically

  he laughed it was a low gur-
gling unpleasant laugh but he an-
swered there are other reasons
why it should be you but you will
need your nerve

  he went to the back wall of the
room and removed two of the vertical
timbeis with the greatest ease if
there were one portion of the com-
partment which would appear freer
from secret openings than another it
would surely have been this for the
center of the wall where these tim-
bers had been placed curved slightly
inward as if under pressure from the
earth behind it yet the removal re-
vealed a dark passage of some kind
down which for a foot or so the feeble
light of the lantern found its way
seizing the lantern my uncle the
voice precluded all doubt of his iden-
tity stepped through the aperture
and said better come it will pay

  i followed and he adroitly re-
placed the timbers they were hard-
ly more than bark for thickness and
weight he then went ahead of me
and almost immediately we were de-
scending a series of rough wooden
steps of gradual slope

  to some it might appear strange
that i would venture in this manner
into the bowels of the earth so lest
i -should appear abnormally fool-
hardy or abnormally courageous i
should point out that i had been born
and bred among mines and as a boy
had often climbed down some old and
disused and oblique shaft such as this
i was really as much at home undei-
ground as upon the surface

  the descent was not formidable
and i calculated that we had gone
down about fifty feet when we came
to a big drive we passed along this
at a rapid pace only here and there
did we have to pick our way around
fallen rock the light shone too
upon a narrow beaten track along
the hard floor of this subterranean
tunnel

  we had been going hardly twenty
minutes before we entered a rough-
hewn chamber i took a swift glance
around it was evidently a natural
cavern but the walls had been
trimmed considerably i almost forgot
my avuncular guide who had paused
and was now slightly behind me i
was just summing up the contents
of the vault-a couple of stretcher
beds a large counter or laboratory
table an ancient pendulum clock near
the wall at my right-when our
merged shadows which fell gro-
tesquely on the left wall a little in
front of me suddenly leaped to the
wall and portion of the ceiling at the
far end of the cavern and as sud-
denly ceased to exist for in an instant
the light of the lantern had been put
out and the whole place surrendered
to the dense black of underground
then before i had time to collect my
senses a metallic crash behind me re-
verberated through the chamber and
i turned helplessly in the darkness
in the few seconds erf ominous silence
that ensued i began to entertain the
terrible suspicion that my eccentric
relative had trapped and deserted me
but presently i heard stealthy move-
ments within the room itself strain-
ing every nerve to catch the slightest
sound i stood as probably only few
could stand in such all but absolute
dark then without the slightest
warning and in a blinding flash the
whole cavern was flooded with light

  for a perceptible fraction of a min-
ute my uncle stood on the farther side
of the counter-table with his fingers
upon a switch and his back toward


weird tales

me the switch was one of a num-
ber on a board attached to the wall at
my right as we entered rather
nearer to me though still at my right
was the clock i had already noted
in a vague way i had heard the tick-
ing of this old timepiece but now that
i was no longer intent upon other
sounds that i conceived might mean
life or death in the darkness i ob-
served for the first time how unusual-
ly pronounced was this sound that so
unerringly registered the swinging of
the pendulum at the moment aston-
ishment seemed to eclipse for me
every other emotion and still the old
man with his back toward me had his
finger raised upon the switch he had
just operated i am convinced that
he maintained this tableauesque pos-
ture merely to enable me to accustom
my eyes to the glare so that he might
have the full advantage of the dra-
matic effect of the next moment for
suddenly he turned round and faced
me

until that moment i had been
prono to smile at horatios ap-
prehension in hamlet that a form
could be so horrible it might deprive
of reason and draw into madness
but i doubt if i-could go through such
a moment again and recover my men-
tal balance i say recover for cer-
tainly during a period of intermi-
nable seconds i was deprived of rea-
son by the very horror of the face
that confronted me about this face
was something inexpressibly sinister
i venture to affirm that it would have
been sufficient to strike loathing if
not terror into anybody but by the
association of ideas it plunged me
into a kind of mental paralysis i
had seen it somewhere before i be-
lieve i swooned i am not sure but
after awhile memory began to oper-
ate with my eyes riveted upon the
unspeakable horror that stood motion-
less at the other side of the table i
remembered

  as a boy of ten i once went with
my mother to visit a house in a town
some miles away while my mother
and a prim woman were talking in a
reception room my eyes wandered
around from picture to cabinet from
vase to window as was natural
enough but presently they kept re-
turning to a photograph that rested
on the mantelshelf there seemed to
be something peculiar about it even
across the room something in the
pose arrested my attention at last
i deliberately walked over to the fire-
place and gazed into the eyes of the
photograph and was instantly precip-
itated into a sort of paralysis similar
to that which i had just experienced
as a matter of fact i all but collapsed
upon that former occasion and reeled
across the room and was in such ob-
vious terror that my mother led me
out of the house and for months and
even years i had a dread of meeting
the original of the photograph know-
ing all i do now i regard this terror
in a large measure as hereditary nev-
ertheless the face of the photograph
was subtly hideous especially the
eyes the whites showed clean round
the irises which through the extreme
dilation of the pupils were reduced
to ghastly rings of film my mother
on the way home told me to forget all
about it as it was the likeness of a
bad man

  and now after a decade i found
myself confronted with this same dia-
bolical personality a little more devil-
ish in the original than in the photo-
graph that had so strangely affected
me after a period indefinite and
eternal as a nightmare and forget-
ting that i had already been assured
within myself concerning his identity
i muttered feebly and mechanically
my uncle

  the gaunt enigma grinned sardon-
ically and intoned your prophetic
soul your uncle

  it occurred to me that i was in the
hands of a possibly dangerous mad-
the derelict mine



man and i was trying to wonder how
i might propitiate him when he con-
tinued in a calm deliberate tone
you must consider yourself my
prisoner or shall we say involuntary
guest

  how long i managed to de-
mand

 for the term of my natural
life   he replied in the same facetious
vein in which he had acknowledged
our relationship

  he then came round and sat upon
one of the stretchers and with an ex-
pressive sweep of the hand indicated
the other for my similar use his
attire was rather more neat than i
might have been led to expect he
wore a well-fitting sack suit of some
dark material and in lieu of a collar
wore a surprizingly well-adjusted
black silk scarf his overcoat and
several disguises lay on the big coun-
ter-table where he had evidently
thrown them while the place was in
darkness 

  we sat on our respective stretchers
facing each other the ghastly eyes
fastened upon my own seemed to be
gaining a sort of mesmeric influence
over me the face itself was horrible
in the extreme but i have not been
able to analyze its features indeed
there was an unnatural elusiveness
about them which was in itself terri-
fying i recall them now but in at
least a dozen variant yet equally dev-
ilish aspects but the eyes with their
infernal power remained invariable
i appeared deprived of movement as
i sat gazing dully into them from the
stretcher the first shock of horror
over i sank into a lethargy though
fully conscious of my surroundings
presently the grim figure sitting op-
posite me in an intent attitude with
an attenuated hand on each thigh
spoke had i the mere sound of his
voice to guide me i might easily have
imagined it to be my father

  now to business i am supposed
to be dead was duly  unduly re-

ported to have gone down in the ti-
tanic the rumor suited me excel-
lently so naturally i did not trouble
to deny it now i am nearly through
and you are to bury me as i direct
if you follow my instructions-well
very well indeed   here he raised a
long lean finger and spoke with the
utmost impressiveness if you do
not follow my instructions implicitly
you will not leave this place alive or
dead either for the matter of that

  he then leaned forward suddenly
and peered at me intently and ex-
claimed your virtuous father never
mentioned me i suppose no yes
we quarreled a woman of course
gad youre like your mother
though about the face that is
you have our physique

  for the first time he glanced aside
and remained in a muse

  it may have been that his sinister
power was for the moment averted
or it may have been his reference to
my unfortunate parents but certain-
ly a new and fierce emotion swept
over me and i sprang to my feet and
my fingers were grasping my re-
volver

  you murdered my father i
cried hoarsely almost towering over
the still sitting figure of my tmcle

  the indescribable eyes were once
moie upon me and at close quarters
were just about as much as i could
stand and retain my reason but the
hideous face was absolutely expres-
sive of no known emotion- as the lips
parted to observe pray my dear
young hamlet consider who de-
stroyed the evidence accessory after
the fact eh  by the way if that toy
goes off at that angle there will be
no good kind uncle to tell you where
to find the key of that door you
know  

  i was staggered and in a daze i
managed to get back to the other
stretcher i had spoken metaphor-
ically as it were and here was a prac-
tical admission of a specific crime


weird

tales

  you actually murdered my fath-
er i faltered imbecilely

  the monstrosity seemed puzzled for
a moment and said with quite an in-
jured air well you need not rub
it in quite a natural sequence to
our little quarrel and he had diabetes
anyway thats why he always kept
a beaker of water at his elbow but

if you saw-

  then he gave a low gurgling laugh
and ejaculated   murdered - you
mean worried he-he worry never
killed a geraldton else my hamlet
you will certainly succumb before
you get through this job

  i was more convinced than ever
that i was dealing with a maniac and
gripped myself as well as i could for
whatever might follow

  the incongruously familiar voice
went on we had better get the in-
structions over the next heart turn
is going to get me

  he went over to the counter and
opened a large trap-door and hauled
oxat a long queer-looking box its
nature was obvious but it would be
difficult to conceive a more extraor-
dinary coffin the ends were square
but there was a considerable differ-
ence in the size ef these squares in-
deed he stood the whole thing on end
and it was perfectly stable it was a
sort of elongated pyramid it had a
lid the narrow end of which was of

glass then in the center of the small
square end was a ring-the only han-
dle he removed the lid and there
within this outer case was screwed a
coffin of regular shape the head of
the coffin from the shoulders fitted
exactly in the outer case but from
the shoulders to the foot there was
considerable space all round it was 
clear that the whole thing was to be
lowered vertically but where

  as if in answer to the query that
was beginning to shape itself in my
brain my uncle strode to a door in
the wall opposite that at which we
entered this he swung open and he
beckoned me to follow him down a
short stope at the door he touched
a switch and a light shone in what
appeared to be a small chamber some
yards away but which upon our en-
tering proved to be an old shaft at
first i thought we were at the bottom
but soon discovered that the floor was
composed of remarkably heavy timber
and several plates of sheet iron near
the outer rim of the false floor was a
hole rather more than a yard square
and just above it was a windlass at
the end of the rope coiled round the
latter was a strong release hook

  my uncle gave a sweep of the hand
toward what i had already conceived
to be an unshapely grave and said
briefly the obvious and moving
toward the stope he added now we
can turn in

this serial rises to a ghastly and thrilling climax in the
description of the horrifying events that took place in
the underground tomb in the derelict mine the
story will be concluded next month
the dance of death

   by jean lahors

       translated by edward baxter perry

               on a sounding stone

               with a blanched thigh-bone

                the bone of a saint i fear

                death strikes the hour
                of his wizard power

      and the specters haste to appear

                from their tombs they rise
                in sepulchral guise

              obeying the summons dread

               and gathering round

               with obeisance profound

     they salute the king of the dead

               then he stands in the middle
               and tunes his fiddle

               and plays them a gruesome strain
               and each gibbering wight
               in the moons pale light
               must dance to that wild refrain

                 now the fiddle tells

                as the music swells

      of the charnels ghastly pleasures

                and they clatter their bones

               as with hideous groans

      they reel to those maddening measures

              the churchyard quakes

               and the old abbey shakes

      to the tread of the midnight host

               and the sod turns black
               on each circling track

      where a skeleton whirls with a ghost

              the night wind moans

               in shuddering tones

      through the gloom of the cypress tree

               while the mad rout raves

               over yawning graves

      and the fiddle bow leaps with glee

                so the swift hours fly
                till the reddening sky
                gives warning of daylight near

                then the first cock-crow
                sends them huddling below
                to sleep for another year
the coupons at the end of the eyrie are functioning well they are
giving us a good working knowledge of the type of stories that you
the readers dont like as well as the type you do like and they
will thus work to the mutual benefit of both weird tales and its readers

    the tale in the march issue that has been most praised and blamed
cussed and discussed is lochinvar lodge by clyde burt clason the cover
design story for that issue a furious battle has raged among the readers
regarding this story it received a great many votes but there were also
a great many complaints and as each complaint removes one vote there is
little left for lochinvar lodge in the final scoring that determines the favorite
story of the readers in that issue

    lochinvar lodge has a bad ending and needs a sequel writes one
reader it is a wonderful story but a rotten ending writes h g camp-
bell of portsmouth virginia lochinvar lodge should never have been
published unless the sequel was already written and in the office safe   writes
c m eddy jr of providence rhode island seabury quinn threatens to
send de grandin down into that dark hole in lochinvar lodge to find out what
has become of the girl and the bearded dwarf unless mr clason writes a se-
quel and solves the mystery himself the story has no satisfactory ending or
explanation writes dr f a fagone of portland maine a wonderful
story if it is true writes miss edith smith of houston texas the ending
leaves too much to the imagination writes raymond lester of new york
city of all your good stories this one started out to be the best but turned
out to be the worst writes lee byrd of lima ohio

    the story does not lack for defenders in fact the letters of enthusiastic
praise outnumber the complaints but so many are the coupons and letters
that protest against leaving the ending of the story hanging up in the air
that we have sent back to their authors two other stories against which the
same complaint might be made to have the endings clarified the use of
the coupons at the end of the eyrie has made your demand very emphatic
that the story endings shall not be vague or indefinite every bit of advice
or criticism is always carefully studied if only one or two readers object
to a story the objection may be merely a personal dislike but if five or ten
persons write in to voice a complaint against a story we feel sure that the
story has failed to make the mark with many hundreds who did not write in
and when forty or fifty persons vote against a story and all for the same
reason then the readers have uncovered a fault in the story that will help

tiie eyrie



the magazine to avoid the same defect in other stories in the future every
vote against lochinmr lodge was cast for the same reason because the end-
ing left too much to the readers imagination

    the readers also picked out for condemnation elwin j owens story
bead in three hours this is the kind of tale a three-year-old would call
kinda scary v writes mildred r kaufmann of philadelphia the hero
is cowardly writes grace l mcloughlin of savona new york there
is no real motive for all the atrocities writes harold s famese of los
angeles the story would be acceptable if one did not get the impression
that it is weird merely for the sake of weirdness

    we hope you will continue to make full use of the coupons at the end
of the eyrie not only to tell us what stories you like best but also to let us
know what stories you dont like if any that will give a great deal of
help both to you the readers and to us the publishers in making weird
tales more and more responsive to your liking we think we know fairly
well what kind of stories you like the constant increase in the sales of the
magazine shows that but by your kindly help and criticism we want to
make the magazine better and better without a single iveak story in any issue
that is our goal

     mabel l pomeroy of corona new york asks for more of the marvelous
stories of henry s whitehead i can sit down now and visualize every one of
his stories in weird tales she adds each one of them is altogether
different from all the others and each is a wonderful story which completely
satisfies the reader several excellent tales by this author are in our hands
for early publication in weird tales and one of his stories appears in this
issue

    powers the jungle monsters is a ripsnortin humdinger writes eli
colter from portland oregon clever well written with the fine tang of
humor and the salt of tears if i were compelled to choose the best story in
the march issue id have to draw straws between powers story and wells
a bream of armageddon but there isnt a poor story among the lists lately
everything stands up well worth reading

    robert e howard author of wolfshktad suggests the old norse sagas as
a rich field for our series of reprints the saga of grettir the ouilmv he
writes while told in plain almost homely language reaches the peak of
horror you will recall the terrific night-long battle between the outlaw and
the vampire who had himself been slain by the powers of darkness

    some of the authors whose stories appear in weird tales write
john pooley wright of st joseph missouri are worthy successors to edgar
allan poe their stories surpassing poes at least in my humble opinion
i was given a copy of weird tales tot read during a recent illness i had
never realized the worth of the magazine before but now i have contracted
a new habit reading weird tales

    writes e h obermiller of chicago you are giving the young
hitherto obscure mystery writers a chance at poes laurels and the typical
weird tales story is like american syncopation-fresh virile original and
not bound by conventions i just finished reading the march issue and it is
the best in months

    writes harry r wallace of longview washington your tales are
so fine that when i get your magazine i can not stop reading until i have
scoured it from cover to cover each month it seems better than the month


weird tales

before i think the novel by eli colter on the dead mans chest is one of
the best that i have ever read it keeps the reader continually in suspense
i can hardly wait until the nest issue of weird tales arrives give us more
stories of other planets such as those by j schlossel and by the author of
when the green star waned

    i would like to see weird tales come out twice a month if you could
keep up your same high standard of good stories writes will obrien of
berkeley california in a letter to the eyrie i read a half dozen or
more weekly semi-monthly and monthly magazines but enjoy weird tales
most of all i enjoy planet stories like the waning of a world ghost stories
horror stories pseudo-scientific stories such as red ether and werewolf
stories-in fact all the stories you publish

   c mason of winnipeg canada writes to the eyrie i found your
march edition of weird tales wholly fascinating i enjoyed every tale from
cover to cover lochinvar lodge had a very disheartening ending but i
enjoyed every line of it on the dead mans chest is extremely appealing
and i look forward with pleasure to reading the last installment and hearing
more from felix underwood

    hazel roby of belen new mexico writes to the eyrie i am a con-
stant reader of weird tales and think it is the most thrilling hair-raising
book i have ever read why cant it be put out twice a month all my
friends read it and we are in a continuous uproar over deciding on the best
stories

    your votes for favorite story in the march issue have given first place to

the weirdest story in the entire issue the music of madness by william e
barrett your second and third choices have gone to a message from space
by j schlossel and simmp horror by will smith and r j robbins what
is your favorite story in this issue 

  my favorite stories in the may weird tales are

the devil-ray

     continued from page 

ray of purple the ship volplaning
now roared on over their heads

  it was all over in a moment that
sinister patch of purple had passed
over the water between them it had
touched no part of ferriss body but
it had gone directly over the head and
shoulders of the spider there was
not a cry not even a murmur the
spider was gone

  in frantic haste ferris swam about
calling the spiders name as loudly
as he dared the plane had reached
the castle and the last fitful roar of
its engines shut out any chance of dis-
covery but the spider ferris swam
around once more calling his name
he dived nothing he dived again
this time deeper down down down
until his lungs seemed to split within
him he could stay down no longer
so he shot to the surface his chest
bursting

  there floating still and white be-
side him in the sable waters of the
blennersee he found the spider but
the thing that made the spider what
he was the thing which had made
him different from the mud on the
lake bottom the thing whieh made

him eat and drink and laugh and talk
-that thing was gone forever just
a touch of the purple and it had van-
ished 

  ferris finally managed to tow the
body to the shore there with the
help of the waiting lefty he pulled
the little man out to the narrow
beach together they worked on the
body for two hours two hours of
fruitless effort inch by inch they
went over his body but not a mark
could they find there was no water
in his lungs he was dead but how
the purple light it must be

  they were men used to acting in
strange emergencies so they scraped
a shallow grave on the side of the
blennersee and buried there the thing
that had been the spider when they
had finished lefty told ferris that
he was through ferris could come
with him if he would or he could stay
behind and play a lone hand for the
jewels as for lefty fritz hed had
enough he was through

  and so that night lefty tramped
down out of the mountain and went
his way but ferris having made
his choice stayed behind

in next months weird tales is told how ferris
invaded castle blennerhof and came to
grips with the mystery therein

continued from page 

   so i see said the man addressed
 as al

then the sheriff bent over me

  ready to talk young man he
 demanded

  it must have mystified this one
 greatly when i leaped suddenly to
 my feet and ran my hands over him
 swiftly how could they guess what
 it meant to me to learn that these two
 were flesh and blood

     thank god  i cried then i be-
 gan to tremble so violently that the
 man called al perforce supported me
 with a burly arm about my shoulders
 as he did so his eyes met those of the
 sheriff and a meaning glance passed
 between them

   the sheriff passed around the cabin
 returning almost at once with three
 horses saddled and bridled for the
 trail the third horse was for me
 weakly aided by al i mounted

  then we clambered down into the
 dry stream and started toward steam-
 boat rock

   i found my voice

for what am i wanted sheriff

 i asked

   for burglarious entry son he
 replied not unkindly you went
 into a house in palisades while the
 owner and his wife were working in
 the fields and stole every bit of food
 you could lay your hands on theres
 no use denying it for we found the
 sack you brought it away in right
 in that three cabin

   but hndreth the wife of plone
 gave me that food i cried i
 didnt steal it

  hildreth plone the sheriff
 fairly shouted the two names

   then he turned and stared at his
 deputy - again that meaning ex-
 change of glances the sheriff re-
 gained control of himself
weird

tales



  this hildreth and plone he be-
gan hesitating strangely did they
have a son a half-grown boy

   yes yes i cried eagerly the
boys name was reuben he led me
into steamboat coulee

  then i told them my story from
beginning to end sparing none of the
unbelievable details when i had fin-
ished the two of them turned in their
saddles and looked back into the cou-
lee toward the now invisible log cabin
we had left behind the deputy shook
his head muttering while the sheriff
removed his hat and scratched his
own poll he spat judiciously into
the sand of the dry stream before he
spoke

  son he said finally if i didnt
know you was a stranger here i would
swear that you was crazy as a loon
there aint a darn thing real that you
saw or heard except the rattlesnakes
and the bobcats

  i interrupted him eagerly

  but what about plone hildreth
and reuben

  plone and reuben he replied
were hanged fifteen years ago
right beside that cabin where we
found you hildreth went crazy and
ran away into the coulee she was
never seen again

  i	waited breathless for the sheriff
to continue

  plone and reuben he went on
were the real bogy men of this cou-
lee in the early days they lived in
that log cabin reuben used to lure
strangers in there where the two of
them murdered the wanderers and
robbed their dead bodies burying
them afterward in a gruesome grave-
yard farther inside steamboat- cou-
lee hildreth so the story goes tried
to prevent these murders but was
unable to do so finally she reported
to the pioneer authorities-and plone
cut her tongue out as punishment for
the betrayal god knows how many
unsuspecting travelers the two made

away with before they were found
out and strung up without trial  

  but how about plones farm in
moses coulee outside steamboat and
the farmhouse where i met the fam-
ily

  its mine replied the sheriff
theres never been a house on it to
my knowledge i foreclosed on it for
the taxes and the blasted land is so
poor that even the rattlesnakes starve
while they are crawling across it 

  but i saw it as plainly as i see
you

  but youre a sick man aint you
you never went near the place where
you say the house was we followed
your footprints and they left the
main road at the foot of the three
devils from which they went
straight as a die to the mouth of
steamboat coulee they was easy to
follow and if i hadnt had another
case on id have picked you up before
you ever could have reached the
cabin  

 would to god that he had it
would have saved me many a weird
and terrifying nightmare in the
nights which have followed

thebe the matter ended-seeming-
ly the sheriff not a bad fellow
at all put me in the way of work
which keeping me much in the open
beneath gods purifying sunshine is
slowly but surely mending my rav-
ished lungs after a while there will
come a day when i shall no longer be
a sick man

  but ever so often i raise my eyes
from my work allowing them to wan-
der against my will in the direction
of that shadow against the walls of
moses coulee - that shadow out of
which seems slowly to float the stony
likeness of a steamboat under re-
duced power

my will i shake my head slowly won-
