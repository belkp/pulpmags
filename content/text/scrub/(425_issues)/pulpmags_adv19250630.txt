stamp out typhoid

if only we had known 
over and over again these
words of helpless self-re-
proach echo in the hearts of
those whose loved ones were
taken from them by diseases
now known to be preventable

 perhaps in your own circle some
 one was stricken with typhoid
 fever-that sinister disease
 which comes without warning
 and strikes with deadly force
 which spares neither rich nor
 poor high nor low young nor
 old which so often leaves its
 victims physically bankrupt and
 subject to other ailments

danger

 typhoid fever is a disease of
 filth caused by a germ that is
 taken into the body through the
 mouth the germ is conveyed
 into the intestines where it rap
 idly multiplies sets up inflam
 mation and creates a poison that
 floods the body sewage-con-
 taminated water unclean milk
 shell-fish from polluted water
 uncooked vegetables house flies
 --all of these may carry typhoid

 that is why it is so important
 that rigid supervision of water

 milk and food supplies be main-
 tained in every section of our country there
 need never be another epidemic of typhoid fever
 science has bestowed a wonderful blessing in of-
 fering protection from typhoid this merciless
 disease can be made as rare as yellow fever in-

 this is the sort of thing that may
 mean typhoid fever for the whole
 family-a satisfying drink of cold
 sparkling water that came from no
 one-knows-where 

 it is never safe to drink from any
 wayside streams or strange wells
 typhoid inoculation offers immunity
 to most people for two or three years
 but to be absolutely safe unknown
 water must be boiled

 inoculation also tends to protect you
 from the danger of contracting typhoid
 right in your own home in many
 cities the health department gives
 such inoculations free

 household helpers who are typhoid
 carriers have been known to infect
 entire families

 inoculation against typhoid has no
 relation to vaccinations for smallpox
 and diphtheria it is an added health
 protection

 oculation by means of a simple
 injection of vaccine under the
 skin will in most cases prevent
 typhoid the injection is re-
 peated at intervals of a week
 until three treatments have been
 given no scar is left in the rare
 cases where typhoid is con-
 tracted even after inoculation
 this protection makes the siege
 much less severe

 campers hikers vacationists and
 all persons who are traveling as
 well as those who regularly eat
 in public places should be the
 first to be inoculated against
 typhoid

 it is true that at times people
 who are exposed to typhoid do
 not contract it they are tem-
 porarily immune but it is never
 safe to take immunity
 for granted be inocu- -
 lated and advise others
 to protect them-

                selves could you
 ever excuse your-
 self had you ad-
 vised a friend
 against inocula-
 tion who subse-
 quently contracted
 the disease make an appointment
 with your doctor for yourself and
 all your family avoid danger so
 far as possible regarding what you
 eat and drink

 typhoid fever kills one out of every ten persons
 who have it those who recover are left in such
 a weakened condition that for three years follow-
 ing the death rate among such persons is twice
 the normal rate

 wherever cities protect their drinking supply
 from sewage or purify the water by chlorination
 the death-rate from typhoid drops a marked
 reduction also takes place in communities where
 milk and food supplies are carefully protected and
 food handlers thoroughly inspected

 the value of typhoid inoculation was proved

 during the world war inoculation of our four
 million men was compulsory in france and in
 our training camps at home there was practically
 no typhoid in our ranks

 contrast this with the records of the spanish-
 american war there one out of every five con-
 tracted the disease

 the metropolitan life insurance company will
 be glad to mail its booklet the conquest of
 typhoid fever to all who are interested in
 stamping out this disease

letters typical of thousands
telling of the amazing power
of one simple fresh food

not a cure-all not a medicine in any
sense-fleischmanns yeast is simply
a remarkable fresh food

   the millions of tiny active yeast plants
in every cake invigorate the whole system
they aid digestion-clear the skin-banish
the poisons of constipation where cathar-
tics give only temporary relief yeast
strengthens the intestinal muscles and
makes them healthy and active and day
by day it releases new stores of energy

   eat two or three cakes a day before meals
on crackers-in fruit juices or milk-or just
plain for constipation especially dissolve one
cake in hot water not scalding night and morning
buy several cakes at a time-they will keep
fresh in a cool dry place for two or three days
all grocers have fleischmamfs yeast start eat-
ing it today

booklet on yeast for health health research

in march  i had what i supposed was a nervous
breakdown i was restless and irritable i had headaches
and dizzy spells i began to use fleischmanns yeast grad-
ually my ills disappeared-i became regular and discon-
tinued the use of cathartics my energy returned-and n
four or five months i was my former self not only have i
regained my health but my color and my general appear-
ance have been improved

mrs margaret ade sweeney roxbury mass

there are many delicious ways of eating yeast
-dissolved in water fruit juices or milk spread
on crackers or eaten plain

i am a hostess at a hotel and not a day passes that someone
doesnt ask me how i manage to be up late at night and out in
the sun every day and still keep my skin so clear and fair and
my eyes so bright my answer is fleischmanns yeast years
of intestinal indigestion had brought me to the point where i
determined id stick at it until i got relief three cakes of yeast
dissolved in water became a daily rite in three months i had
the results i wanted-relief from indigestion gas and chronic

upon the town the straw-roofed huts
huddled within the white walls of clay and
masonry walls punctuated every hundred
yards by squat massive watch towers
looming over the whole the glistening tiles
of the central building of the french fort
held the light on either side the rugged
flanks of rust-colored mountains loomed to
the purplish sky crisscrossed by a magnifi-
cent patchwork of blue-black shadows
raoul farel was again swept by the stark
raw beauty of kita

  the swarming blacks in gaudy garments
moved mke ants on a disturbed hill the lithe
women wrapped in gaily striped boubous
bulky burdens on their heads and fat babies
astride their hips unexpected highlights in
their rounded shoulders shoulders almost
as muscular as those of the men the stately
strut of a wealthy trader occasionally the
broad blue-clad shoulders of a tirailleur of
the garrison pushing his way through the
throng grinning face under the red chechia
-all these formed many minute pictures
when the eye tired of immensity sought
detail

  colors smells sounds an orgy of sensa-
tions assailing at one time all the senses
the feel of the elastic turf underfoot the
voices of the crowd swelling into a cataract
of noise pierced by the shriller wails of the
peddlers as the roar of the torrent is punc-
tured by the splash of drops

  the mighty fascination of africa was still
strong upon farel as strong as on the day he
had landed in dakar three years before
the old lure the longing for the hot and
brilliant sun persisted unabated men said
that the air was miasmatic the climate
debilitating air and climate were tonic to
him the knowledge that tomorrow he
would plunge deeper into the heart of the
sudan thrilled him anew

  he glanced at his hands tanned hairy
they appeared too powerful too capable
to be his arriving in the sudan in his
twenty-third year he had grown an inch in
height and had gained pounds in weight
between kayes and kita he had found him-
self his nebulous ideas had become fixed
into a fanatical love for the country farel
loved the sudan as men love women

  dimly he imagined that he had lived in
africa before in some bygone age how
else explain his feeling that he had never
really lived until he had stepped on the soil
the scenes the customs the languages

never struck him with surprize why did
the sonorous syllables of the dialects ring in
his ears with the tantalizing elusive sound
of tongues once well known and merely for-
gotten

  his tirailleurs their minds unclouded
perhaps by the sceptical teachings of civili-
zation expressed aloud what he had vaguely
believed-

  thou art one of us lieutenant though
allah granted thee a white skin

  he did not resent this assimilation by an
inferior race aware of his white blood he
was nevertheless proud of his grip on his
negro followers he was glad of their loy-
alty and approval

  he now found his tirailleurs in line for
inspection eighty-five picked men arms
and equipment were in perfect condition

  good men and reliable recruited from the
same group of villages all were more or less
related by those complicated ramifications
of relationship fully understood only by the
blacks farel had learned that men bom
in the same village could supply more effort
than a heterogeneous aggregation composed
of different races to distinguish them at
roll call he had been compelled to number
them makam tiaba the sergeant an-
swered to tiaba number one the
seven other tiabas in the unit bore other
numbers for practical use this scant
company was worth more than three outfits
of the same size

  everything is well declared farel in
conclusion tomorrow we start for
boure

  boure the land of gold the richest
province in the sudan where even with the
primitive methods of the natives samory
had formerly collected a yearly tribute of
one hundred thousand francs in gold dust
on the yield of the placers boure the
fertile land on the banks of the niger-
dialiba the great river of the malinkes

  france was at peace with samory em-
peror of the ouasoulou who called himself
almany chief of the malinkes com-
mander of the faithful farel no more
than any one else was deceived by this
temporary truce the issue must be
settled either samory must be removed
from his throne or the french must aban-
don their conquest there was no room
for two masters and samory intended to
remain master in fact as well as in name
farel knew that the negro leader was but

biding his time to obtain modern rifles from
sierra leone there the rolland com-
pany and the west african coal com-
pany waxed rich selling him weapons

  but there was little likelihood that
samory would be ready for an attack on the
french before farels return to kita at the
start of the rainy season arms and am-
munition must be transported on foot from
the seacoast to bissandougou capitol of the
ouasoulou

   officially farels mission was topograph-
ical he was to check the map drawn by
major delaneau a few years previously the
chart of the network of trails that pass by
kita toward the niger the lieutenant had
a solid reputation in that line of work

  like many officers in the service farel
had a hobby a passion his special hug
was ethnography the study of races a
dozen articles had been published under his
name in the reme coloniale and had met
with appreciation from the few specialists
in the boure farel expected to learn much
he was taking several malinke interpreters
well-educated men as education is esteemed
in the region they knew the traditions
the legends of the tribes farel would come in
contact with through them the lieuten-
ant hoped to be able to reconstruct the
shadowy history of the blacks

when he reentered his room to
conclude his packing his boy
handed him two letters

  orderly bring em says they
came today from kayes

   official envelops from headquarters farel
regarded them dubiously orders before
departure might mean that his trip was can-
celed and the prospect of a monotonous stay
in garrison before him this would not be
the first time an officer was halted at the last
moment his careful plans necessitated by
the movement of nearly two hundred men
through a savage land would go for nothing

  he opened the first envelop

  i knew it he exclaimed adding unflat-
tering remarks about the meddlesome fools
responsible for the delay the paper was
an order to postpone his departure until
further notice

  farel passed to the second message hop-
ing to find a permit to go ahead a contra-
diction of the first it was a letter from
combeau the colonel commanding the
french forces in the sudan



my dear farel

  you have received an order to remain in kita
at the last minute i decided to give you a com-
panion-two months on the trail alone is not good
for any man you may go ahead as soon as be
reaches kita

  probably wishing some ass on me
fare grumbled and then read on

   you are probably aware thatyour official mission
in the boure is but one reason for your trip i
think that the legislators in paris will soon come to
the conclusion that we must either retire from the
field or go ahead i do not doubt but that the sec-
ond course will be decided upon then our columns
must advance through the very territory you will
cover i want a careful report of conditions south
of niagassola i want to know in advance the atti-
tude of the village chiefs toward us it will be
valuable to know where our friends are and where
samorys friends remain loyal to him

  your knowledge of natives your ability to speak
the common dialects the prestige of your military
record in the last campaigns all assure me that i
could not have made a better choice a few judi-
cious promises tactful handling of the leaders will
pave the way for us and save lives

  your companion has been highly recommended
to me he seems alert intelligent although your
equal in rank i have made it perfectly clear to him
that he will be under your orders permit me to
tell you that i am prompted by the thought that he
could not have a better mentor than yourself in this
land the petty bickerings that occasionally arise
between commanders are impossible between you
as he was a classmate of yours at saint-cyr you
remember him no doubt gustave champdor

best of luck cordially

g combeau

  champdor he recalled a large noisy
blond fellow flunked regularly in mathe-
matics at saint-cyr the military academy
popular with a certain set rather dull-
witted on serious matters champdor prided
himself on being intellectual old military
family maternal uncle a general his father
some sort of secretary in the war ministry
rumor said that champdor had passed
through school mainly on outside pull a
nice chap to take along

  there goes my enjoyment concluded
farel tossing the letters on the table

  he wondered whether combeau had not
given in under pressure from champdors
high-placed protectors and assigned the
new man to the boure mission to give him a
chance to distinguish himself at farels ex-
pense

  farel had a momentary impulse to spring
out order tirailleurs and bearers on the
trail and disappear before champdors
arrival he might have carried out this


adventure

scheme had he been dealing with any one
but combeau past performance good
character would weigh nothing in the bal-
ance it farel went against orders

  he sat before his table in blank dismay
until he was summoned to the mess-room
for the evening meal the three officers

composing the staff of the kita garrison
chaffed him about his downcast appearance
and he found it difficult to refrain from giv-
ing vent to legitimate indignation

  im getting a new man he announced
recent arrival

  the others regarded him in pity

  well thats life we must take the
bad with the good was offered as con-
solation

  he spent a bad night

shortly before noon champ-
dor arrived

  the newcomers genuine joy at
being with a former classmate
his ready smile for the moment dispelled
farels premonitions champdor apolo-
gized for the delay he had occasioned and
wished to start out immediately farel
protested that a days rest was necessary so
that he might recover from the long trip
from kayes

 i presume you think im a -

nuisance champdor declared i dont
fit in green you know

  forget it we all have to start farel
cut him short im glad its you instead of
some one else but what brought you out
here i thought you had entered the line
infantry

  i did good little hole too regular
comic-opera garrison-major with a funny
wife-but my father demanded my transfer

to the naval infantry you knowr he
thinks that its the place for quick pro-
motion

  many are under that delusion farel
admitted drily you find it pretty dull
out here eh

  well champdor pondered i cant
exactly say that its interesting-the
blacks you know but a chap soon be-
comes tired of it dont you think

  at times farel agreed

  they walked from the fort to inspect the
tirailleurs farel was curious to see what
impression champdor would make upon
them

  what sort of a hole are we going to

  boure territory natives call it the
land of gold  he smiled the right
place for you-suits your name

  champdor in french means gold field
champdors sense of humor reacted favor-
ably he laughed loudly

  thats a good one farel a good one
say i hear youre getting educated down
here i saw one of your articles

  bits of information i pick up here and
there

  champdor rubbed his chin thoughtfully

  thats right he said

  before the tiraitteurs champdor came to
a halt

  that your sergeant he indicated
makam tiaba dominating the line looks
strong those queer marks on his face
make him seem savage

  makam tiaba good bambara bore the
tribal marks the broad scars three on each
cheek from corner of eye to corner of mouth
the truth was these scars created a mask
far from reassuring even in repose farel
chuckled when he imagined champdors
comment should he ever see makam in ac-
tion also he wondered what the new
white mans reaction would be when know-
ing the black better he would discover the
tenderness of feeling hidden beneath the
fierce front

  they all look good commented
champdor

  theyll do farel admitted

  champdor timidly as child handing an
orange to an elephant circled the big
bambara makam tiaba abashed by the
scrutiny remained as if hewed from black
marble finally champdor addressed him
in his precise french tiaba deeply em-
barrassed by his failure to understand
the figurehead



looked helplessly at farel who taking pity
on both translated

  use few words simplify your language
he advised champdor he gave a few
commonplace expressions in illustration
try them now

  champdor with a sheepish grin obeyed
makam relieved answered champdor
passed on to others

  farel who knew every reaction of his
men was bewildered one and all from
makam tiaba sergeant to samadin the
little elephant diminutive private the
soldiers appeared to like champdor mak-
am removed the last doubt

  he good white man

  the stamp of approval was placed on
champdor by the most exacting member of
the company a thing for which white
men sometimes worked for years without at-
taining it farel could not understand
stories that had floated about in the class-
rooms at saint-cyr came to his mind
champdor was the possessor of a weird
charm not being subject to it himself
he had disbelieved and now came the
proof

  catch nice hair went on makam sen-
timentally referring to champdor

  the-if i thought tiaba inclined to

the appreciation of manly beauty thought
farel

  interested in spite of himself he regarded
champdor with attention tall slim of
waist broad of shoulder his behavior was
that of a man in good physical condition
his body was that of an athlete naturally
to men who associated courage with
strength and size champdor with his great
stature his tremendous vitality seemed
heroic

  catch good eyes too makam mistak-
ing silence for approval was adding to his
reasons for liking champdor

  nice hair nice eyes-farel began to
understand champdor was an unusual
type to negroes his extreme blondness
his fresh rosy skin and lilac-blue eyes fas-
cinated the men if farel had not shied at
the word applied to a man champdor
might be called beautiful the lieutenant
realized that his own dusky tanned face
could not cause the admiration that the
resplendant pigmentation of his friend
occasioned

  champdor was returning from the end of
the line smiling

  queer fellows i like them though
primitive of course he paused abruptly
say farel what could i do to-to-in a
way-celebrate my arrival i want them
to like me you understand

  if you have any spare cash buy them
some extra food two or three lambs kola
nuts its not necessary or even cus-
tomary but if you care to-

  sure i care to champdor fumbled in
his pockets drew out a handful of silver
gave it to makam tiaba here sergeant
plenty sheep-eat

  without knowing why farel found his
ill humor growing what a strange devel-
opment champdor the pleasure loving
young man was quite capable of winning
the affection of the tirailleurs also the
newcomers exuberance irked him he
did not realize that this very exuberance
the boyish enthusiasm was the chief cause
of champdors instant leap to popularity
childish themselves given to open mani-
festation of feelings the bambaras liked the
lieutenants ways

  in the messroom that night farels won-
der increased

  champdor with his stock of anecdotes
fresh from paris his fluent talk of horse
racing politics and women his easy wit
was naturally the center of attention this
was to be expected anything that broke
the monotony was welcome at the post
but champdor held more than attention
he was liked the sober-faced captain
who had chronic dysentery and rarely
smiled now unbent wrinkled his leathery
cheeks into a grin and ordered the boys to
bring vintage wine from his private stock
yarn followed yarn laugh followed laugh

  you know what farel tells me champ-
dor announced that my name is literally
the name given by the natives to boure
peculiar eh a good omen for me

  farel began to wonder why the others
did not resent champdors boisterous
manner

  then champdor reached out his hand
laid it on farels shoulder and smiled his
smile wiped out all trace of resentment in
farel he smiled back frankly

  im glad that old farel is the fellow to
help me cut my teeth out here champdor
stated he is serious and im an ass
one counterbalances the other

  not such a bad fellow champdor
thought farel


adventure

six weeks later the two lieuten-
ants arrived in a small village on
the niger bank

  here as everywhere they were
received cordially by the dignitaries and the
population apparently the presence of
white men in the boure had lost the shock of
novelty chickens lambs baskets of fruit
were brought in plenty to the door of the
spacious hut given them as residence by the
elderly loutiguy village chief the usual
swarm of children congregated and stared
admiringly from a safe distance

  champdor learned to accept this some-
time annoying curiosity as a matter of course
the big fellow even enjoyed making a spec-
tacle of himself for a juvenile audience such
as shaving or brushing his teeth

  on this day arriving early in the after-
noon farel had said that he would employ
the hours of daylight left him to clear up
his notes jotted down during the last few
days he was in high spirits the mis-
sion was a success his map would correct
the slight errors made by the preceding
expedition and he had gathered definite
information on conditions in the boure

  although the last treaty had taken boure
away from samory the chiefs bands still
made trips to the left bank of the niger to
collect tribute and recruit men for war
service an occurrence of recent date
properly handled by the french would
swing feeling away from the black leader
samory had taken several women from a
village for his already crowded harem in
bissandougou no doubt feeling secure in
his might he had neglected to pay for them
the ethical value of the deed angered no
one but the financial loss had caused re-
sentment

  farel had promised the chief in each of the
villages he had visited that the french
would soon come into the boure with
tirailleurs and cannon and build a fort at
siguiri where the best ford across the
niger was located

  having established his work table in the
shade of a convenient tamarind tree he
watched champdor disappear camera in
hand

  champdor had shown an artistic taste
that farel candidly admitted was lacking in
himself the new lieutenants sketches of
native types were not only amusing but
well executed for an amateur farel there-
fore trusted his second with the camera

hoping thereby to obtain not only valuable
photographic documents but well composed
pictures a quality not to be scorned boy-
ish in this as in other things champdor had
gone whole heartedly into his task on the
journey from kita to niagassola across the
red plateau and from the latter town to the
niger champdor had often taken long ex-
cursions for the sake of a good plate

  and in this particular village-farel knew
that champdor could obtain interesting
views the picturesque cluster of round
malinke huts with the slightly flattened
cones of the roofs the graceful trees fig
tamarind and baobab the broad expanse
of the niger visible across the partially
flooded rice plantations were worth re-
cording

  for a time farel worked intently his
pen traced curves and twists busily shaded
the hachures indicating altitudes

  then imperceptibly a sound penetrated
his consciousness a droning steady noise
floating to his ears from far off

  tomtoms he decided nothing strange
in tomtoms they regulated much of
african life taking the place of church bells
and public criers drums probably youths
were being initiated into the man-clan in the
forest or even the news of his arrival was
being transmitted to another town one-
two one-two he found himself absentmind-
edly counting the beats

  the rhythm assumed a familiar ring
evoked dim memories one-two one-two
the beat was too monotonous to be a mes-
sage it was a rallying call he had
heard the call before-a sharp stroke space
two sharp strokes in quick succession

  from a certain mellow ring in the instru-
ment the fact that it resounded clearly al-
though evidently at a great distance farel
concluded that a very large instrument was
in use bigger than the average village
tomtom

  one-two a quick beat space and two
more-

  he should know the call when the
hordes of samory had marched on bamako
the days and nights were punctuated by
the pulse of the tomtom

  fabou he told himself

  fabous tomtom with its constant un-
changing one-two rythm a war tomtom
-fabous signal he could not mistake it
fabou was on the right bank of the river
less than five miles away
the figurehead



  not a pleasant neighbor fabou but safe
enough now when samory was at peace
with the french he fabou was prob-
ably gathering his men for an expedition
against some unruly village farel breathed
more easily when he reached this con-
clusion

  an hour went by

  then makam tiaba who had been squat-
ting on his heels some yards away resting
after the morning march stood up
stretched and came forward he settled
himself again nearer and looked at his
chief expectantly tiaba evidently wished
to talk and had thus announced his inten-
tion he usually avoided disturbing farel
when he worked

  what dost thou want tiaba the
officer questioned without looking up

  thou dost hear nothing demanded
the sergeant cautiously

  the tomtom

  yes i dont like tomtoms

  farel looked up tiaba was not easily
perturbed and if he did not like the tom-
toms he had a valid reason

  why

  three tomtoms there each tomtom
is tomtom of one batiguy-chief of one
thousand men

  i hear only one farel said

fabous-

  we blacks have ears for tomtoms
there is one near two more far the one
thou dost hear is truly fabous the next
is tekoubas the last one ngolo
fabou tekouba ngolo three names
known wherever samory was known the
first was his brother the second the leader
of his riders and the third ngolo was a
former sergeant of tirailleurs who had
taken service with samory after his dis-
charge in vain farel tried to catch the
sound of the two tomtoms he had not iden-
tified but blacks have ears for tomtoms
that no white man can equal

  makam tiaba dost thou think that the
tomtoms threaten us

  yes why should there be so many
warriors across the river

  samory is our friend farel objected
samory is no mans friend he made
peace but what can be done can be undone
didst thou not hear that he had punished
his own father for disobeying him if
fabou malinkamory ibrahima or any
other of his sons and brothers disobeyed

him would he hesitate to kill him see
thou hast come within short reach of him
and he will attack

  well see tiaba

i do not speak because i fear tiaba
added but i believe you should know that
the somonos have been summoned with
their canoes to fabous side of the stream
true

  tiaba wordlessly spat in the dust he
had spoken the truth and scorned to an-
swer an implied doubt

  this last information meant much to
farel the somonos were the masters of
the niger they never paid tribute to any
one and were left at peace by all to pursue
their trade of fishing on the sole condition
that they ferry travelers across the river
when required they would take fabou
and his men to the left bank as cheerfully
as they would have transported farel
they accomplished their work for the
sake of retaining their immunity in time
of war regardless of the purpose of their
employers

  farel invited tiabas opinion-

  will they come tonight

  no there will not be enough canoes
to take everybody across tonight all day
tomorrow they will cross fabou has
learned perhaps that thou and the other
lieutenant will stay here until tomorrow
noon

  for a time farel was silent then he
ordered

  double the sentries tonight tiaba
give out extra cartridges one hundred to a
man as an afterthought he added
send a man to tell lieutenant champdor
i must talk with him

  tiaba left

  champdor arrived almost immediately
and was soon informed of what had oc-
curred

  youd better get some sleep this after-
noon farel suggested youll be leav-
ing on the trail at eleven

  whats the idea champdor asked in
surprize i understand theres danger
but whats the purpose of my leaving alone
it would be best for both of us to go we
could get a good lead by morning

  theres a little matter of tact in ques-
tion weve announced to the chief that
we would stay until tomorrow noon

  yes but i dont see-

  i have promised him protection if he


adventure

comes out openly for us and i have or-
ders from combeau to leave a good impres-
sion if i leave in a hurry at the mere
sound of fabous tomtom- do you
see

  i admit it would look bad

  fabou will not be here until tomorrow
well into the day by that time i will have
left at my own stated time a little thing
of course but it means a lot to these people
who are watching me closely

  he worked with his pencil for a few sec-
onds then went on

  youll take the bearers all the impedi-
menta and march fivemiles away there
youll wait for me in case i should be
caught here i dont want a lot of useless
men with me you take one section i keep
the other he handed champdor the
paper he had just noted heres a sketch
of the vicinity its crude but it gives
the necessary indication youre to wait
here- he marked the spot heavily-until
i join you

  champdor glanced at the map doubt-
fully

  say farel did it ever occur to you that
if he lands here before noon he may come
straight up the trail and attack me leaving
you to finish off later

  forty tirailleurs are not to be despised
ill join you if i hear firing in any case it
is scarcely likely fabou will butt the
nearest thing-me he doesnt like me
weve met before in fact given his choice
between my head and yours hed take mine
ive decided champdor i stick here un-
til noon

  champdor thrusting his thumbs in his
belt paced up and down rapidly then
halted bruskly before the table

  say i think its crazy this petty matter
of pride is it compatible with your re-
sponsibility as mission commander to
jeopardize everything like this my advice
would be to go tonight together and gain
niagassola wed be better there behind
walls with the garrison than out here-and
of more service

  farel surprized looked intently at
champdor the smile was gone and the
rosy complexion with it the lieutenant
was quite pale farel could not refrain
from asking

  are you sure champdor that your
question of utility to the nation is your
chief concern or our-your-fate

  i i dont know champdor replied
weakly am i to understand that you

think-that you accuse me of-

  i accuse you of nothing old man farel
declared steadily you leap at con-
clusions i can see youre nervous thats
all dont fret faboull attack me first
and if you hold the place ive assigned ill
be all right

  champdor obviously wishing to retrieve
his unfortunate remark grew bolder

  look here he said warmly ill obey
your orders i know my place-but i dont
see why i shouldnt share the full risks
right here with you

  the chief cause of confusion in a hasty
retreat is never the soldiers but the bear-
ers youll help me most by keeping them
out of the way

  i wont be sorry to see a little excite-
ment champdor declared airily the
trip was interesting from your view-point
but thats not what we soldiers were intend-
ed for

  therell be plenty of excitement as-
sured farel

  champdor wheeled on one heel with an
attempt at his former exuberance and
went into the hut presumably to prepare his
belongings farel stared after him quiz-
zically then shrugged

  champdor my friend he concluded
you have shrunken a little lets hope
you dont burst like a bubble

on the other side of the niger
samorys men were gathering

  the huge tomtom emblematic
of high command stood at the
side of the trail on a rise of ground domi-
nating the surrounding fields squat
obese formidable in spite of the primitive
ornaments of brass and leather the gaudily
decorated sides vibrated with the blows of
the black in charge summoning the faithful
to haste

  the cohorts of fabou overflowed the nar-
row road spilled into the plantations
yellow boubous crossed by the scarlet scarf
supporting the short saber baggy trousers
of blue fastened around the ankles red
black or yellow caps drawn tightly on the
woolly skulls the warriors streamed by in an
endless flow toward the river bank

  the murmur of voices the shuffling of
naked feet in the red dust were dominated
by sharp words of command by the peculiar
the figurehead



squeal of the war-horns many of the rifles
were new recently arrived from the coast
the pouches slung from each mans shoulder
were crammed with cartridges never in
the history of the sudan had such an in-
spired well-equipped army taken the field
perhaps el hadj omar the tukuleur at
the height of his power when the negroes
still believed in him and his voice fired men
to self sacrifice had brought together more
men butthey had not been armed with
breach-loading rifles and these men of
fabou of tekouba of ngolo were merely
an advance guard samory was coming
up from bissandougou with twice as many

  behind the pulsing tomtom well out of
reach of the choking dust a picturesque
group of riders had halted in the shade of
the trees

  astride a black horse several feet away
from the others a man looked on the war-
riors impassively he wore a snowy-white
boubou gold embroidered which draped
over voluminous trousers of dark cloth and
high leather boots against the white
cloth hanging from the turban the face
stood out clear as an engraving a fine-
featured face light-brown in color high
forehead well-shaped nose firm ups a scant
beard lengthening the chin more than any
of his followers he revealed the strain of
berber blood

  remaining motionless a majestic figure
palm on the hilt of his saber he seemed a
materialization from the mystical tales of
sudanese tradition another diawara wield-
ing the magic sword of mekka

  he was fabou brother of samory

  before the coming of the french fabous
name had been synonymous with victory
the tirailleurs led by their french officers
had changed this had thrown him from the
pedestal of glory he had been defeated
by forces not one-tenth as strong as his
own once at oueyako he had thought
himself victorious only to be smashed by
one of the deceptive moves familiar to the
newcomers

  fabou felt that his defeat had been due
to inferior armament what could he hope
to do against rifles and field guns with noth-
ing save percussion rifles and trade muskets
but little less dangerous to the men who
handled them than to the enemy some
said even within his hearing that the fault
was his that he could not cope with the
french because they were better warriors

much depended on his showing in the at-
tack on the morrow if he failed samory
would probably remove him from high
command

  but fabou was confident that he would
not fail that he would initiate the next cam-
paign with a success throw as a defiance
the heads of two frenchmen into com-
beaus teeth

  he had a vision of a triumphant march to
kita then to kayes negores who had ac-
cepted french rule through force of circum-
stance would arise and follow him he
smiled perhaps within him lurked the
ambition to take samorys place if he
won over the dreaded invaders no dream
was too great

  he turned in the saddle called ngolo
the former tirailleur a great black whose
boubou was decorated with amulets

  who leads the tirailleurs camped across
the dialiba

  a chief with two braids whom thou dost
know-far-eli

  spies inform me there is another white
man with him who is he

  no one knows he was not with the
french when i fought with them he must
be newly come from the islands

   it was the general belief in the sudan that
the french inhabited a group of islands off
the north coast of africa they were also
thought to be few in number and their
reason for african invasion to obtain blacks
to work for them

  i know far-eli fabou admitted mus-
ingly i have seen him i am glad it is
he whose head will fall

  ngolos teeth flashed in the crimson
mouth

  he has not fallen yet fabou my mas-
ter far-eli is a good warrior so is
makam tiaba whom i also know and
being white the other chief with two braids
must be brave

  fabous lips twitched evidently ngolo
did not please him with his too ready grin
tekouba he called

  tekouba detached himself from the
group and drawing near waited respectfully
a sort of giant with ebony skin and coarse
face

   i have chosen thee to attack first in the
morning fabou informed him pick
good followers

  it will be done master

  fabou waved both men back and re-


adventure

sumed his contemplation the dust rose
higher from the south more warriors
were coming they filled the road as far
as the eye could see in every direction and
their quick pattering was cadenced by the
tomtoms

that night the chief of the vil-
lage invited the white men to at-
tend a dance given by the youth-
ful element in the central place
champdor who was to leave quietly at
eleven was requested by farel to attend
and not to give signs of impatience or reveal
in any manner his intended departure
it was an absolute certainty that among
the inhabitants several spies watched their
every move and farel intended champ-
dors maneuver to remain secret

  farel and his second sat on the veranda
of the chiefs hut a rudimentary veranda
formed by the projection of the roof as in
the average malinke village an enormous
cotton tree grew in the center of the open
place huge fires had been lighted al-
though never quite a fire worshipper the
african loves light due to the quality of
the wood used the flames assumed a green-
ish hue at the root swelled redly and ended
in a marvelous flowering of golden tongues
twisting against the darkness with beauti-
ful unforeseen designs

  what might be termed the orchestra was
installed on the edge of the illuminated
circle and to farel whose ears from long
acquaintance were attuned to primitive
music the medley did not sound unpleasant
champdor after listening admitted his
surprize

  it has a weird charm he declared
sounds like nothing i have ever heard
should grate on my nerves and yet doesnt
i dont even find it ridiculous

  there were of course tomtoms there
were two balas zilophones from which the
musicians coaxed deep mellow notes that
rippled and cascaded with haunting melody
the native guitar the cora was represented
the malinke flute the foula clarinet piped
shrill notes it was not a confused medley
but a well-ordered performance with every
instrument filling in its appointed part

  at times the tomtoms would dwindle to
a faint drone and the clear note of the flute
lifted and voiced the soul of the village-
loving black farel half closing his eyes
could recall the pastures in the hills where

the stolid pheul leads his herds to graze
and betrays his loneliness with the sound of
the flute as have pastoral tribes in other
lands

  the theme shifted and the bambara
horn made of an elephant tusk would glint
in the ruddy light and warlike squeals
would ring echo while the young men
greeted the call with loud shouts sole
means of expression of a poetic race this
barbarous music held all the characteristics
that make up the black the depression
the sudden hilarity the drowsy moments
the fierce rise of fighting lust

  the married women in a circle clapped
their hands and the girls danced according
to their interpretation grotesquely or grace-
fully

  champdor preoccupied laid his hand on
farels shoulder

  do they know what will happen to-
morrow

  yes

  their village may suffer

  all the more reason why they should
enjoy themselves tonight farel paused
then from his store of recollection dug up
a tale for champdors distraction he felt
that the lieutenant was not happy was
more than a little lonely and more than
half frightened i have seen men cap-
tured the night before and women too
dancing and singing in the fire light they
did not know where they were being taken
what their fate would be all day long
they had carried tremendous burdens had
seen their friends and relatives knifed for
lagging yet the tomtom brought them on
their feet

  where was that

  not far from kita during the last cam-
paign i led a reconnoitering party at
night and watched the scene from the
bushes and i wondered if these people
would ever understand us whether we were
really their superiors-

  it is not a proof of intelligence to laugh
when in trouble grumbled champdor
or at the prospect of death

  im not claiming that it is intelligent
mildly corrected farel but if the re-
ligions that we white men believe in are not
created to bring us to a cheerful acceptance
of trouble and death then i am mad
these negroes have succeeded we have not
queer thing champdor how extremes meet
the most learned philosophers are those

who can take their own demise as calmly as
that of any other man all teachings re-
solve ultimately in preparation for death
after scorning the worries of life philoso-
phers and malinke negroes react alike

  champdor nervously lighted a cigaret
farel watched his face in the brief instant
the glow lasted still good looking was
champdor but singularly drawn of feature

  champdor picked up the conversation

  i for one can not see the idea of throwing
away my skin light heartedly a man is
made to live

  youve chosen the wrong profession
farel remarked

  possibly

  farel broke the conversation by turning
to the chief and talking to him in dialect a
calabash shell filled with a frothy liquid
was passed from hand to hand in the group
of elders a special container had been
handed to the two white men farel drank
and passed it on to champdor

  not bad in fact quite strong the big
man commented

  dolo millet beer farel classified
another cause why the natives will be
glad to see samory go then as champ-
dor regarded him questioningly originally
samory was a fetishist when he rose to
power he accepted islam for the same
reason that henry iv became converted in
our own county-policy and being con-
verted he declared all his subjects mos-
lems as well as himself according to the
koran dolo is forbidden in his dominions
the fetishist being used to dolo did not
accept the edict with good grace so dolo
was made in secret and absorbed in secret
even during samorys reign here now
that he is gone and we do not object they
are making up for lost time dolo is harm-
less but creates the taste i tremble to
think what will occur when the sulfuric
trade gin comes into this land in quantities

  champdor lifted the container to his lips
and took a long draught

  thou wilt see good dancing soon the
chief promised farel

  the central place had been cleared and
was revealed bare in the firelight from
the opposite end of the village a procession
appeared composed of very young girls
from seven years to ten their supple
bodies dark brown glinted like so many
bronze statues they filed gravely with
short shuffling steps formed graceful figures

the line dividing crossing and recrossing in
an intricate pattern

  farel had heard of the dancing girls of
boure and was delighted enthusiastic

forgetful of the fact that the next day
would be filled with trouble he applauded
clapped his hands to the delight of the
old leader who was immensely happy that
something in his humble village had touched
the white visitor

  even champdor was interested strange-
ly the fact that he could not speak the
native tongue seemed to make him a fa-
vorite with the chief who attempted often
to draw him into conversation in broken
french and laughed at the lieutenants
attempt to pronounce malinke words

  joli jolil he declared slapping himself
on naked thighs pretty pretty

  the dance ended the chief called one
of the girls to him there was a great deal
of excited comment among the elders and
finally the loutiguy addressed the child
for a moment it was uncertain whether the
dancer would cry or laugh optimism con-
quered and she grinned joyously then
knelt before the bewildered champdor
what the-

  the chief gives her to you as a present
explained farel with a smile dont re-
fuse hed be offended

  champdor scratched his head in deep
embarrassment

  what will i do with her

  the authorities will take her off your
hands there is an orphanage at saint
louis on the coast where the sisters are al-
ways happy to take in interesting or unin-
teresting pupils

champdor rubbed his chin thoughtfully
i have money enough to take care of her
ill trust her to some negro family in kayes
instead she wouldnt be happy uprooted
shell soon be off your hands in any case
at thirteen or fourteen shell marry
whats her name champdor inquired
kalogue said the chief

  white moon or moonlight if you pre-
fer translated farel

  presently he glanced at his watch

  ten oclock he announced in quick
french we better make a pretense at
sleep

  and so the frenchmen arose and took
leave of their hosts

  what am i to do with the kid won-
dered champdor


adventure

  take her with you if you want farel
turned to the child and conversed at some
length she says she must visit her
family until morning ill bring her to-
morrow

  good

  they gained the hut and sat in darkness
waiting for the appointed time

  in the meantime farel went on to ex-
plain 

  the place where youll stop is a sort
of gorge through which the trail runs you
could hold out there any length of time
with the number of men at your disposal
thats one of the reasons i am sending you
there whoever holds that spot holds the
trail to niagassola naturally youre a
trifle worried-a man always is before his
first engagement but i trust there will be
no trouble

  how will i find the spot at night

  makam tiaba knows the way he was
down here before with the mission that
signed the treaty with samory

  makam tiaba will be with me champ-
dor asked in a relieved tone

  its time farel announced soberly

  they went out found the bearers and
tirailleurs asleep save the sentries kept
alert by the alert sergeant they had been
kept in ignorance of farels intent but
those who were to follow champdor got up
without grumbling in a low voice farel
made the last recommendations to makam
tiaba he wished that it were compatible
with his position as a white man to give the
bambara precise knowledge of what was to
be done but that would have been an un-
necessary slight of champdor

  so farel kept to matters of detail such as
were within makam tiabas duties as a non-
com and trusted to fate that champdor
would execute the more important items of
the plan

  down the gentle declivity leading to the
village place the fires still burned high the
orchestra played and shadowy forms leaped
and twisted a tirailleur brought champ-
dors horse and the lieu tenant mounted
quietly tiaba took the lead and the de-
tachment slowly moved off tirailleurs and
bearers silent according to instructions

  for more than a mile farel accom-
panied his second he longed for a more
experienced man to trust and inwardly
cursed the devious ways of fathers in search
of promotion for their sons

  at last he halted offered his hand

 tomorrow at two-

  tomorrow at two champdor repeated
  good luck farel added

  same to you and bon couragel replied
champdor

  farel stood still and stared after him in
the darkness the darker bulk of the small
troop faded gradually disappeared it
was as if they had vanished toward the
dim stars

  good courage champdor had advised
yes agreed farel good courage was needed
he himself had always found sufficient
reserve to meet situations good courage
if champdor had it tomorrow might mean
a successful day

the sun was turning the morn-
ing mist over the niger to light
shreds of pink vapor when farel
arose

  absolute peace reigned over the village
the tomtoms that had throbbed at intervals
the day before were silent now yet a
sense of impending events hung over the
countryside with satisfaction farel no-
ticed that the village was emptied of women
and children also that the majority of the
men had left the others were even now
filing out in procession unhurried as men
who know the amount of time left them to
accomplish what they wish

  the chief pipe between his teeth ap-
proached farel

  we are going away the rifles will soon
be speaking around here

  yes-after i leave it is best that fabous
men find the village emptied otherwise
they would say that thou didst fight on my
side and pillage and kill in reprisal dost
know if fabou has crossed the stream
the old man glanced to right and left as
if he feared a possible listener who might
report to samory that he had given infor-
mation seeing no one save the white
man and the tirailleurs he replied frankly
enough

  he has crossed he stretched out his
long hand with the knotted fingers and
wrinkled gray-black skin he is there
where the river curves

  how many men with him

  as many as leaves in the trees men say
who have seen them they speak as is
their way rashly but a good number
anyway
the figurehead



  thank thee chief i may perhaps
harm some of the huts facing the enemy
it will be necessary for defense i will try
to spare thy village as much as possible
and will go at noon

  why should i protest for huts when
thou art risking thy body reassured the
chief i hope all goes well with thee-
farewell

  farewell

  in fifteen minutes the last inhabitant
had departed farel immediately set to
work loopholing the huts that faced in the
direction of fabous warriors with three
of the most intelligent soldiers corporals
he paced the plain which the attackers
would be compelled to cross estimated the
distance from tree to tree and gave in-
structions as to the manipulation of back
sights

  aim always at the knees he advised
at long range men usually shoot too
high

  then he mounted his horse and alone
left the village for the main trail which led
north to champdors position he wished
to see for himself every incident of the
ground every twist in the path

  pride was not his only motive for await-
ing fabou he was not being rash he
had sufficient experience to know exactly
what he was doing his detachment of
picked men could be depended upon to
excel fabous warriors in marching and
fighting burdened as was the native lead-
ers column with inevitable weaklings it
is a well-known military axiom that the
pace of a unit is that of its slowest man
there were no slothful marchers among the
tirailleurs

  his apparently overbold inaction of the
night and morning had a purpose mili-
tary reports are based on facts not on pre-
sumption morally farel was certain that
fabou was hostile and would attack ac-
tually he was supposed to believe that
samory was carrying out the treaty he had
signed the first shot would have to be
fired before he could inform combeau in
kayes that hostilities had broken out

  in turn combeau could inform the gov-
ernment of late the chamber of deputies
in paris had been loath to vote credits for
the sudan the more spectacular expedi-
tions in indo-china held public attention
the african conquest was reported to be a
waste of life and money a mad dream

national pride would force the hand of the
law-makers if a french unit was attacked
the credits would be voted moreover
farel wished to estimate the strength of
fabous forces and the ability of the war-
riors so that he would be able to state with
authority whether the new rifles made a dif-
ference in the efficiency of samorys men
these details ascertained now would save
many lives the greatest loss in colonial
warfare is felt during that uncertain period
when a european army is testing the worth
of its opponents learning the more familiar
tactics the reaction under given circum-
stance once a white commander has
learned these details he should be able to re-
duce his losses to a minimum

  when the french campaigned in indo-
china the white officers with the advance
guard were invariably shot down from
ambush their men in trying to save
the bodies from mutilation suffered great
losses it was several months before the
order was given that the advance guards
should be exclusively native troopers the
result was immediate the loss of white
officers fell to a fourth of what it had for-
merly been in the sudan the problems were
different but equally possible of solution
and today farel would know what new
methods samory had learned

   at thirty minutes past ten the lieutenant
saw the first yellow boubous strung out be-
tween the trees through field glasses he
rapidly noticed an improvement in march-
ing order probably the effect of ngolos
teaching more boubous issued from the
shelter of the trees until they formed a liv-
ing barrier their left flank resting on the
river bank their right on the road

   farel lifted a whistle to his lips and blew
a signal the tirailleurs entered the huts
and took their posts at the loopholes

   in front of them the warriors had halted
it was now nearly eleven oclock

  riders in white rode up and down their
front gesturing then a group detached
itself and came forward several yards
knelt grayish puffs of smoke edged the
muzzles of their rifles disappeared the
bullets went too high to be heard farel
scribbled in his notebook after a last glance
at his watch

eleven-two fabou opens fire

  eh thou he addressed the nearest
corporal


adventure

  lieutenant

  when the men over there pass that
tree- he indicated he spot-the men
will fix rifles-so

  he picked up the corporals piece and
adjusted the sights the corporal went
from man to man then he returned and
saluted

  all ready

  farel lighted a cigaret and cheek resting
on palm contemplated the enemy they
were obviously astonished by the complete
silence from the village but they grad-
ually neared the danger zone at last the
first warrior passed the imaginary line
the corporal grunted an order the sharp
detonations of the gras rifles crackled from
hut to hut no visible damage was done

  more care urged farel is there any
hurry thick-heads

  he took the rifle from the nearest man
rested it on the wall aimed with exaggerated
deliberation

  see that tantiguy-chief of ten equiva-
lent to a corporal-over there

  yes lieutenant

  tell the men to stop firing until i have
shot him farel ordered

  the tantiguy was mounted and some
yards in the lead of his squad farel lined
his sights with the riders knee pressed the
trigger for a second he doubted his suc-
cess then the fellow brought both his hands
to his midrift bent over the neck of his
horse and fell into the outstretched arms of
his men farel returned the rifle to the
owner

  see its easy when care is used

in spite of this assurance the
aim of the tirailleurs did not
improve until a more reasonable
range was attained then the
hail of lead took effect and huddled war-
riors dotted the path of the advance ngolo
had attained one result protection of an
attacking party by supporting fire but
against the thick walls of clay field artil-
lery would have been needed by mere
accident a few bullets entered the loop-holes
whined through the huts and struck dully
against the farther wall

  stepping to the safe side of the hut farel
looked out at the shadows-it lacked but a
few minutes of twelve now the patient
move forward of fabous men had taken
the best part of an hour they were now

under cover of strangling bushes and ob-
viously waiting word for the final rush
across the field from their starting point
a single horseman galloped superbly care-
less of the bullets

  tekouba some one announced

  a little thrill half expectation half fear
could be felt among the tirailleurs tekou-
ba although involved in fabous defeat
still inspired respect his courage was un-
doubted the fury of his attack a byword
probably fabou had held him back until
the crucial moment so that he would not
fall before he could be of use

  farel again placed the whistle against his
teeth blew four blasts and with the lieu-
tenant in the lead the tirailleurs filed out
into the back street passed into the trail
farel not wishing his departure to be
known and not wishing to offer himself as
a target above the bushes walked while his
orderly led his horse behind him

  the firing ceased tekouba he reasoned
thought the tirailleurs were reserving their
fire to blast the first wave of attackers he
hurried and he could hear the panting of the
soldiers behind him they understood his
move and grunted approval by the time
they were discovered only a few of samorys
men would be in a position to attack them
and they could outstrip the others

  a storm of cheers before the village an-
nounced that tekoubas onslaught was un-
der way the pounding of rifle butts on
walls and doors the screams of encourage-
ment from the leaders the discharge of fire-
arms breaking out afresh made him smile
it would be several minutes before the brave
samorians realized that the huts were
empty in spite of their number they
would proceed with caution awed by the
thought of half a hundred soldiers waiting
for them bayonets ready

  the frenchman and his followers had
reached the main trail before the sound of
the shouts changed from fighting lust to
disappointed rage his trick being dis-
covered there existed no further need of
concealment he gained the saddle and
urged his mount forward at a canter the
tirailleurs trotted after him

  so far all had gone well and there was-
little cause to worry he would be able to
join champdor before the pursuers caught
up and finding his strength doubled fabou
would hesitate giving him time to take the
niagassola trail the cavalry of the native
the figurehead



leader could not use any path save the
beaten road for the soil was bushy and
rocky at niagassola his responsibility
ended he automatically fell under the or-
ders of the fort commander a captain
moreover he had not lost a man

  and the information he desired was ob-
tained samory meant war

  aware that some one trotted swiftly along
close to his right stirrup he glanced down
the scantily clad girl dancer kalogue was
keeping pace with him a bundle on her
head in truth it must be said that she was
not over-pleased with the method of travel-
ing adopted by her masters comrade and
was on the verge of tears and exhaustion

  in the excitement of the morning he had
forgotten her after his first natural con-
clusion that she would ignore her change in
masters and flee to the woods with her
mother

  where hast thou been kalogue he
asked

  when the poum-poum started i hid
i saw thee leave-and came where is the
big white man she panted

  we are going to him now

  it is good

  farel was annoyed by this added respon-
sibility reasoning calmly she was worth
less than a tirailleur he was about to lift
her to the saddle when-

  lieutenant the corporal bringing up
the rear called out

  what

  samory men

  farel heard the ringing hoofs of a
mounted troop not far behind approaching
swiftly he had seen no horsemen on the
field as a unit and was bewildered by
fabous prompt pursuit he gave the
necessary order and the tirailleurs about-
faced around a bend in the road a hun-
dred and fifty yards away appeared more
than a score of riders they did not belong
to the cavalry but were the various chiefs
of units engaged against him in the storming
of the village

  tekouba sabr in fist was conspicuous

  at the first shots half the assailants
tumbled the breach locks slid rasped shut
again and more saddles were emptied

  outnumbered fearful of the bayonets
the horsemen slackened their rush the
tirailleurs ran swiftly down the road bay-
oneting the wounded where they lay with
a quick side dart of the long blades alone

tekouba again miraculously unscathed
kept on having eyes only for the white man
whose head he had promised to fabou

  farel who had reined his horse across the
path drew his revolver and broke the
negros arm with the first shot the tir-
ailleurs recovering from their first excite-
ment clusterd about tekouba dragging at
his legs and brought him to the ground
with an impact that shook the giant frame
and almost caused him to lose conscious-
ness several bayonets entered his chest
at the same time and between his teeth
blood gushed

  the blades came out red and were poised
for other blows tekouba eyes wide open
kept his gaze on the red steel needles

  farha nal farel called dont kill

  a half dozen startled faces lifted toward
his farel himself could not understand
why he had cried out probably a remnant
of his early code which reproved the killing
in cold blood of a brave helpless foe then
farel realized that with six or seven wounds
letting his blood out tekouba would soon
die but the lieutenant did not wish to
change his orders once spoken

  tekouba looked up his lips twisted
with pain but his eyes were clear

  good he accepted and seeing the
tirailleurs about to leave asked a last
favor tell thy men to place me to die in
the shade and allah grant thee a like
finish

  upon farels gesture acquiescence two
privates lifted him and placed him in the
shadow of two bushes by the trail he was
soon lost to sight

  on either side of the trail rock masses
rose higher farel was getting near the ap-
pointed meeting place another few min-
utes and with all his men he would be on
the cleared road to niagassola

  sound colors farel ordered to the
bugler

  the stirring call strung out its notes
then from ahead came the answer the same
call

  hes there farel told himself then as
an afterthought what a foolish thing a
hunch is

  he resumed the march

  when he could see the clump of trees
marking the exact emplacement assigned to
champdor he urged his horse went ahead
of his men eager to tell his second of his
successful coup
i

adventure

  a rifle coughed a long vibration warned
him that the missile had come very near
champdor what the- tell your

  a volley answered him behind he
heard grunts stifled cries several of the
tirailleurs were hit two of them killed out-
right what was the matter with champ-
dor to add to his agitation a bugle the
same that had picked up his first signal
sounded open fire it must be champ-
dor samory did not have bugles

  cease fire he cried cease fire he
whirled in the saddle bugler-cease
fire

  but the bugler was dead sprawled in the
trail the hail of bullets continued more
than half his men were down the rest
having no orders were undecided and
frightened

  back-back out of it farel shouted

  what was left of his section retraced their
steps down the trail out of range behind
bushes

  farels mouth felt dry his hands shook
this was ghastly and that infernal bugle
was ringing again halting the fusillade
what could have happened in champdors
mind to make him act without ascertaining
upon whom he was firing had he gone
mad with responsibility and fear

  he fastened a handkerchief to the scab-
bard of his sword and was about to go for-
ward again when one of the tirailleurs
touched his knee

  dont go lieutenants not there
ngolo

  farel recalled rumors that had been
current in kayes ngolo had organised
his troops like french infantry gave his
commands in french why not the iden-
tical bugle calls but if ngolo was hold-
ing the trail where was champdor it was
unlikely that he had surrendered and had
he been attacked the sound of firing would
have warned farel

  where was champdor

 the tirailleur addressed him

          fabou will come up from be-
          hind-

  yes something had to be done quickly
in a short time the head of fabous column
would come up the trail and he would be
caught between two fires he looked about
for a lane of escape saw only the steep walls

of the rocks asudden desperate hope
sent him in search of the native child whom
he had last seen keeping pace with the tir-
ailleurs she had abandoned her bundle
and was hiding by the side of the trail

  dost thou know a trail up the hills not
far off

  yes i came to cut wood with the women
often the child replied breathlessly

  show us the way

  abandoning his horse and the badly
wounded members of his troop he followed
the girl what a strange twist every-
thing seemed prearranged to make this
child be of service if he had allowed
champdor to refuse the chiefs gift or if
champdor had taken her with him-

  kalogue knew the vicinity of her native
village following her farel gained the
top of the nearest cliffs cut across thick
shrubs over small plateau in ravines fol-
lowed brooks and almost obliterated trails
she was an able guide the key to their vast
prison of bush and streams the tiraill-
eurs took turns in carrying her

  fabous men had picked up their tracks
the bootsoles of the white officer were un-
mistakable to the practiced eyes of the
many professional trail-followers in sam-
orys legions soon the yellow boubous
materialized in spite of their efforts the
followers of fabou had failed to surround
farel they would form a circle close in
and find their prey gone it was much like
trying to catch fish by hand in a pool of
murky water and kalogue knew the
trails every nook and corner of the plateau

  seventeen from forty-one leave twenty-
four farel muttered seventeen from
forty-one leave twenty-four-

  at twelve minutes before two oclock that
afternoon he had had forty-one tirailleurs
now at a quarter of six less than four
hours later he could only count seventeen
of these several showed bandaged arms or
legs or untended cuts about the face on
the trail when ngolos men had fired he
had left fifteen or sixteen men therefore
eight had fallen since ifthe wild nature
of the land prevented the weight of numbers
to tell it also annulled the superior organiza-
tion and skill of the troop led by the white
man in the short range fusillades a tir
ailleur was no better than a warrior yes
he might lose more men before nightfall

  the tirailleurs had their reserve ration
of food so that hunger was not felt bu
the figurehead



the water soon gave out negroes are great
water drinkers it is not unusual for a
thirsty bearer to drain a bucket containing
the allotment for a horse this need of
fluid may be the result of excessive loss of
moisture through perspiration once the
canteens were dry the brooks were resorted
to in taking care of the wounded how-
ever farel had unadvisedly used too much
water and the streams were being watched
now

  the lieutenant was tempted to order
his men to don the boubous found on the
dead and to mingle with the pursuers leav-
ing him to take his chance alone but he
knew what the answer would be they
might join samory after their time of
service with the french expired but they
would never leave a white man for whom
they felt responsible

  although he had exposed himself as
much as his men he was unwounded his
greater nervous reserve was telling the
spirit of a white man will often tire out the
sheer muscular vigor of the blacks

  where do we go now kalogue he
asked

  the child counted on her fingers

  one trail is closed two trails- after
a moment she decided follow master

  we must hurry kalogue night is com-
ing

  i hasten

  she led the way through the bushes
stopping occasionally to ponder after
half an hour she halted and pointed at a
clump of shrubs bearing great red flowers

  we go under that

  farel did not understand her reason but
his life was in the tiny black hands of the
dancer and he nodded the girl crawled
under the branches farel followed her
for twenty-five feet he followed the pink
soles in the semidarkness insects dis-
turbed skimmed across his fingers once
he heard the unmistakable rustling of a
lirge snake then abruptly kalogues
legs vanished from beneath her body slow-
ly she lowered herself into some sort of a
cavity it was not a hole properly speak-
ing but a deep cut in the soil altogether
sheltered by bushes meeting overhead

  when the rains are heavy water flows
here kalogue informed him it is like
this for a long way then sinks under-
ground

  she waited until the last tirailleur had

joined them then proceeded swiftly toward
the north farel believed

  surely thou didst not come here to cut
wood he declared

  no my father when he lived was
hunter for the village he found this
place following a leopard

  thy father did not take thee hunting
did he

  no but many moons ago when the
village failed to pay tribute samorys riders
came and my father took me here i my
brothers my sisters and our mothers

  it was not strange then that kalogue
took the adventure calmly this was not
her first hurried flight

  abruptly the big ditch ended against a
wall of rock a hole opening beneath the
cliff yawned a black funnel pitting the
ground for many feet a hidden water source

  what do we do now he asked

  she lifted a stumpy little finger black
satin on one side cream on the other

  up

  can it be done he asked in amaze-
ment

  there was still sufficient daylight to dis-
cern the flank of the cliff hard of ascension
but not impossible there are few things
impossible to a man whose life is in danger

  here however another problem con-
fronted him he must abandon two of the
tirailleurs wounded too badly to negotiate
the feat he recommended that they re-
trace their steps search for bodies take a
yellow blouse and black bonnet and pre-
tend to be members of the searching par-
ties the lax inner organization of fabous
bands promised almost certain success
they could join him in niagassola when op-
portunity offered meanwhile he would
make it known to french authorities that
they were not deserters

  farel started up first agile as a monkey
kalogue came immediately behind the
lieutenant recalled his vacations in the
mountains of eastern france what he
had learned there was useful now bad
moments followed when he was forced to
test one hold after another before daring to
trust his weight many times he was com-
pelled to halt clinging to the sharp edges
of the rock to advise his men the tirail-
leurs were heavier than he and the support
which had served him might give way un-
der repeated strain cascades of dirt and
dirt showered toward the hole below
i

adventure

  three feet to climb two-one the top of
the cliff overhung and farel searched for
a solid place to execute the move that would
hoist him the final distance

  immediately above his head a black face
appeared two yellow-clad shoulders be-
neath

  farel could neither reach the revolver in
the holster of his belt move up down or to
either side he was trapped with one
move the warrior could precipitate him into
space but farel was not a pessimist he
realized that the first normal impulse in
man is to help another in distress he must
not allow the warrior to recover from his
surprize in any event it was his only
chance

  tal he urged holding up his right hand
grasp

  the negro obeyed powerful fingers
closed upon the white mans farel con-
fidently trusted himself to the immense
strength of his helper in another instant
he stood beside the sentry

  once safe his enforced faith in human-
ity deserted him as faith sometimes does
when the need for it is past without
releasing the hand that had so fortunately
descended to save him he drew his re-
volver pressed it against the blacks side
a quick glance had assured him that the
warrior was alone

  then he relaxed his grip on the sentrys
hand and stepped back

  help the others he ordered

  kalogue was hoisted to firm ground and
one after another the fifteen tirailleurs

  who is thy chief farel asked

  the native did not have faith in human
nature did not believe in gratitude be-
fore the threatening muzzle he docilely told
all he knew

  ngolo

  many warriors close by

 no one but me i was sent up by
ngolo who said i could see thee down
below and point thee out to the others

  where is ngolo now

  the man did not know

  did he kill the other white man

  the warrior again shook his head badly
frightened as he was farel felt that he spoke
the truth for a moment farel was in-
clined to tie him securely thinking that his
comrades would find him but a bound
man in the open at night is in danger of
never seeing the sun

  marabout farel asked touching the
warriors amulets

  yes agreed the sentry he was a

moslem

  farel gathered several amulets from his
men which he added to those of the war-
rior forming a little heap on the ground

  i will allow thee to live he promised
but swear to keep secret our way of
escape

  it would be unwise for me to speak re-
plied the negro for it was my hand that
allowed you to go

  he swore all that was asked of him by
multiple awesome formulas farel his
natural optimism returning found time to
notice the similitude between this oath and
the oath sworn by knights in the middle
ages

  i am called far-eli the white man
concluded seek me when peace comes
again i will reward thee then these
men will say that i speak the truth that my
tongue and my heart talk alike

  it is so several voices assured him

  the warrior touched farels sleeve then
his own forehead looking back farel
could dimly perceive him standing be-
wildered still shaken by the extraordinary
events

  where is the trail kalogue

  i dont know i have never been so far
from the village

  farel glanced at the stars and set out

  for many hours he kept to his course
instinctively against the sky he could see
the reflection of ngolos fires knew when
he passed the farthest outposts for negroes
never fail to signal their presence by flames

  at last he knew he was clear he did
not reason men like farel often know with-
out reason they walk through danger as
a blind man walks through night

i beg your pardon lieuten-
ant champdor for disturbing
you farel remarked a few hours
later

  champdor who had just concluded a cold
meal who had evidently eaten heartily was
holding a lighted cigaret in one hand and a
metal cup filled with wine in the other

  having passed quietly through the out-
posts facing fabous bands farel had sig-
naled the sentries to remain quiet and had
reached the chief of the detachment with-
out being noticed for a moment he stood
the figurehead



still watching the irritatingly innocent
face the chiseled profile the lilac-blue eyes
no man with a tortured conscience would
have honored the tinned meat product of
the american contractor with such a
splendid appetite

  champdor looked up stared incredu-
lously then smiling arose hand extended
old farel do you know im glad to
see you

   farel accepted the hand-shake

  you seem comfortable champdor he
said evidently had an easier time than
i did

  probably agreed champdor with
superb calm

  he offered no explanation yet farel
felt that explanation was due him the
extraordinary unconcern of the officer
swept him from his well-planned inter-
rogation which would have coaxed the
truth gently

  why the-werent you at the pass

he demanded straining to keep his voice
down for the troopers were casually sprawl-
ing about

   i left at two-fifteen naturally when
 you didnt show up i thought youd been
 caught in the village the firing ceased
 you know

   you lie i was there before two and
you had already gone i found a bunch of
blacks who shot down half my men

   champdor without appearing to be of-
fended by the epithet sympathized
thunder thats too bad

   farel wondered who was mad himself or
champdor certainly in his opinion the
discussion called for more interest than
the officer was showing

   he grasped his arm shook him and al-
most shouted in his face

  too bad too bad do you under-
stand what you did

   perfectly honestly farel i believed
 jt to be after two- he made a gesture
 toward his fob pocket-lets compare

watches--

   idiot

   champdor drew himself up with ridicu-
lous dignity

   lieutenant farel you are insulting me
   i am farel admitted i am-

   the pent-up resentment swelled to his
lips in searing words all barriers of polite-
ness all so-called gentlemanly behavior was

wiped away by the immense anger that
flamed in him

  champdor listened patiently he was
still dignified and did not seem angry

  youre overtired farel he suggested
you better rest then talk i will not
brawl with you i admit i may have been
too hasty in my withdrawl but my respon-
sibility as detachment commander made it
imperative

  i have a letter from combeau placing
you under my orders i gave you the
order to stay at the pass until i came i
named two oclock as an approximate
time you had no order to leave even
though i failed to come on time remem-
ber that

  possibly farel i should have taken

your suggestions-

  in the army one does not take sugges-
tions one obeys orders there are twenty-
six lives laid against you champdor you
may sing a different time before a court
martial

  a court martial- champdor paled
abandoned your post didnt you
and from the firing you knew you were
before the enemy

  champdor sank back into the folding
chair he had occupied when farel arrived

  farel his first anger passing lowered his
voice-

  whatever made you do it champdor
i didnt know i didnt want to stay
there and risk-what i thought had hap-
pened  you

  didnt you find it hard to leave a com-
panion i might even say a friend up
against it

  champdor shrugged wearily

  tell me exactly what time you left

  i might as well twelve oclock i-
i thought- he floundered helplessly

  you had made up your mind that i was
crazy and would be killed is that it
well-

  farel dug his hands in his pockets strode
up and down in agitation he stopped
looking dumbly at champdor the big
fellows total collapse appalled him he
had never before seen a man go to pieces so
completely cowardice that must be it

  i dont know what to make of you
champdor he said you dont behave
like a reasonable being giving way to the
first impulse blissfully unconscious of the
harm youve done


adventure

  champdor seemed near tears farel
laid a hand on his shoulder

  im not even angry with you youre
a kid he declared try to tell me what
happened i have to account for the men
ive lost and id like to make it as easy for
you as i can you can go home-after
everythings over

 home muttered champdor then
loudly i want to go home i never want-
ed to come here he arose excitedly
grasped farel by the arm and walked swift-
ly out of the camp youve got to listen
to me farel youll understand i know
you will

  try to keep calm old man farel
urged try to keep calm

  he feared an irreparable outburst of
hysteria in full view of soldiers and bearers

 keep calm how can i keep calm
you tell me ill be court martialed ill be
kicked out of the army wont i what
will my father say what will my family
do

  what every one does when anything
happens-grumble weep protest then
accept if youll tell me in detail what
you did and the reason for your actions
i may find a way to avoid the court
martial

  you would farel champdor quieted
i dont know any reason for my action
at twelve oclock suddenly something told
me to go and i went

  were you afraid

  yes

 why of what

  you know-death mutilation

  do you want a bit of advice champdor
  yes

  dont say anything like that to any one
else i should be the one to accuse you but
i cant frankly i pity you in a soldier
cowardice is a fatal disease better say you
misunderstood youll be blamed and sent
back to your little garrison and all will be
said

  champdor broke out laughing

  all will be said eh if i receive a pub-
lic reprimand my lifes done my

father-

  -has nothing to do with it said farel
you stand on your own feet tell him its
his fault for having had you transferred
here

 then-no money i couldnt live
pinching every penny on a lieutenants pay

figure out what i need every two weeks-
two francs fifty centimes for laundry cuffs
and collars even turning them around
dirty side in-i have seen others try it
some manage remarked farel

  not i

  marry money then

  money marries money i have no title-
nothing

  farel became impatient

  then chuck the army for good go into
business you wield a neat pencil and write
fairly well i can easily picture you making
a success in an artistic profession youre
miscast old boy youre not a soldier

  i know it but im afraid to-

  you remind me of a four-year-old boy
refusing one thing after another and not
knowing what he wants patently i can
not help you out if you insist on staying in
the service my duty is--

  champdors face flushed his pupils
dilated

  this is a lot of fuss over a handful of
negroes he said a hundred can be re-
cruited for each one lost ill accept no
favors from you and ill guarantee that ill
not be court martialed he drew breath
i have influence we will see if com-
beau heckles me- he swept the air with an
open palm significant of destruction-
you smile you dont believe me my
uncle will be cabinet minister again
theres a limit to what pull can do
theres no limit-for me

  all right all right farel humored him
lets start the men off ngolo is only
ten miles away its thirty good miles to
niagassola

  at mention of ngolo champdors
bravado left him he allowed farel to
give his orders

  he made no protest when farel com-
mandeered his horse explaining that as he
had walked all night he was entitled to the
mount champdor took no notice of
kalogue who trotted at his heels looking
up at him with adoration soon he made
his way to the center of the column im-
mediately behind the bearers and trailed his
feet in the dust wearily

  i told lieutenant i wanted to go back
and help thee makam tiaba remarked
drawing up to farels stirrup he said
no-that thou wert dead

  he did rightly farel cut him off
shortly
the figurehead



  tiaba startled subsided and allowed the
horse to outdistance him what was farel
to do he could not allow discussion of a
white mans orders by a native sergeant
truly champdor was placing him in an
awkward position in more ways than one

  farel cursed at the indiscriminate placing
of shoulder-straps on a man and believing
him thanks to these symbols able to com-
mand

  but was champdor to blame he could
not help what he was and farel could
not very well have placed makam tiaba in
charge of the second detachment the in-
ference would have been obvious com-
beau was perhaps to blame again no
he had acted under orders or at least under
suggestions from persons he could not af-
ford to displease

  if traced to its source yesterdays dis-
aster was the result of a bad system the
nation which tolerated it was to blame of
course it was said ifavoritism is banished
from the army champdor was a living
example of the contrary left to himself
the heedless officer would have vegetated
in his garrison town being promoted when
his years of service warranted promotion
had a war come he probably would have
done his duty well surrounded by white
men and familiar scenes champdor was
not to blame not to blame-that was
quickly stated

  if one follows the theory of attentuated
responsibility no one is to blame for any-
thing of recent date it was quite usual to
blame heredity environment and what
not for a mans failings all very well in
theory but out of place in a soldier farel
decided fighting is a world-old business
and its code is as ancient a captain does
not leave his ship until the last an officer
does not abandon his post

that night champdor at-
tempted suicide

  the day it must be admitted
had been particularly hard on a
nervous imaginative fellow like champdor

  twice when the trails permitted the
riders of fabou had flanked the little party
firing from the saddle bullets had whined
through the ranks men had been hit
champdor his white uniform conspicuous
among the bearers had several narrow
escapes each time before he could show
fear farel had been at his side with

encouraging words the warriors hung on
doggedly still hoping that an unforeseen
twist of fate would reduce the lead taken by
the boure mission the distance to nia-
gassola dwindled gradually farel counted
the miles with no little anxiety

  he reasoned that news of the engagement
must have reached niagassola the tom-
tom telegraph had rumbled all day the
natives knew about the fight by the river
bank and certainly some of them would
inform the captain commanding the fort
farel knew him well knew the lieutenants
with him they were not of the champdor
type personal safety never entered their
heads when a white man was in danger
they would come out to meet him

  he admired the endurance of his men
tirailleurs as well as bearers there was
no need of threats or promises to hasten the
latter the fear of capture gave them
wings several times during the day he
had allowed champdor to ride the horse
and himself gone to the rear guard until
the accumulated fatigue made him totter on
his feet

  when he visualized what this march
would have been had champdor held his
place he cursed bitterly after the severe
shaking up before the village fabous
forces would have been discouraged by an-
other check at the pass instead the war-
riors had come upon the dead bodies of the
tirailleurs fabou had probably ordered
the heads cut and planted on sticks along
the road the men in the yellow boubous
were doubtless gloating over these heads
far more than they regretted the two or
three hundred men they had lost while rush-
ing the village walls the moral effect he
had counted upon was lost in the light of
developments his persistence in staying in
the village until the time stated for de-
parture showed merely stubborn courage
and no skill a success never has to be ex-
plained a failure always farel had much
to think of on that journey to niagassola

  at seven with darkness deepening he
ordered a halt of an hour then the march
would be resumed and carried on until the
post was attained toward dawn

  tired he lay down to snatch a few
minutes nap and lost sight of champdor

  a revolver report brought him to his feet
wearily then realizing that no one but
himself and champdor possessed a revolver
he ran toward the spot from which the sound


adventure

had come makam tiaba preceded him

  twenty yards away in the bushes bor-
dering the trail they found the lieutenant
sprawled out he held the weapon in his
right hand farel rapidly felt his heart
then his head his fingers came away
moist sticky

  hes hurt carry him back tiaba

  tiaba slipped one arm beneath the knees
the other under the shoulders and lifted
the limp body he brought champdor
back within the safety zone formed by the
cordon of sentries

  light a lantern tiaba

  the sergeant obeyed as soon as the
yellow glow bloomed in the obscurity the
riflemen fired from the bush the bullets
whined landed all about with the peculiar
ff-jlack as they thudded into the ground
farel found the wound on the side of
champdors head a graze from temple to
top of skull the hair was singed there
was no doubt but that champdor had tried
to end his life

  decidedly the big officer was not meant
to handle firearms he had not even been
able to shoot himself the impact of the
lead had stunned him and that was all
the bleeding was already slacking

  nothing much tiaba farel informed
the sergeant probably one of the blacks
hit him by luck put out the light

  tiaba leaning toward the lantern his
face illuminated brightly stared at him lips
apart farels necessary lie did not de-
ceive him but he made no comment and
blew out the flame the fusillade stopped

  farel strove to bring champdor back to
consciousness he dashed water in his face
shook him called out beat his palms this
attempt at self-annihilation was not cour-
age farel did not believe that it was the
same sort of thing that champdor had
evidenced since danger became manifest
nevertheless farel was touched he re-
alized the mental torment that champdor
must have undergone to make him choose
such a ruthless course when all his being
cried out for self-preservation it was a
kind of negative courage

  champdor grumbled coughed

 mother-

  the lieutenant did not smile that word
was often heard on the lips of men when
dying or in extreme danger

   youre all right old man take it easy
he admonished

  you-farel-i-i missed myself didnt
i

  absolutely bad style yours the
barrel should never be held parallel with the
head muzzle against the roof of the
mouth is the best i have been told but
its over now im glad you failed
what shall i do what shall i do
forget it fate did not want your end
now have a drink

  champdor gulped at the bottle offered
him filled with cold coffee strengthened
with brandy

  i wanted to get it over with he ex-
plained its this way farel theres
never been a coward in the family my
family champdor resumed plaintively
my father is a pen-pusher now but he was
in the cuirassiers in  you know what
that means his father colonel champ-
dor was in algeria a friend of de mon-
tagnac the hero of sidi-brahim my

great-grandfather in eighteen-twelve-

  farel had no interest in the family history
but he strove for patience listened long to
the ramblings of champdor who insisted
on unearthing ancestral deeds of valor for
his admiration

  at the first pause he interjected

  i can see your point you may have
acted rightly but i want you to promise
me now that you wont try again if not
for your own sake for mine andthe men
with us suppose you had succeeded and
then i had been killed tonight all goes

well as long as theres a white man but-

  im not much good as a white man
you made several mistakes but they
have faith in you faith my friend is the
bulwark of old husbands and young sol-
diers farel arose and stretched his
muscles well you succeeded in keeping
me awake during our rest hour were
going on now

  he found tiaba

  stay with the lieutenant-he is not
well understand

  i hear

  dont let him stray too far from the
trail he hesitated see every move
he makes

  i have seen i know fear nothing
if i am hurt thou-well help the other
officer

  i hear replied tiaba

  farel when he turned could see the
southern sky suffused with lights the fire
the figurehead



of fabous army but the enemy did not
lose contact never had farel seen such
tenacity displayed by natives usually
they were more than willing to live and let
live during the sunless hours

  the bushes were swarming with riflemen
and spearmen farel felt no worry con-
cerning the tirailleurs who with bayoneted
rifles were a match for both but the re-
peated attacks on the bearers burdened
with their head loads was another story
several had been wounded farel decided
to organize a defense against this harassing
business knowing that his white flannel
uniform was dangerous marking him as a
target he swiftly changed into a black
tunic discarding his helmet for a chechia
in this manner he disguised his silhouete all
that could be seen in the night rifle in
hand he led the counter attack running on
the side of the bearers when he joined
the pillage-mad warriors butts and blades
came into swift play but for every man
dropped two appeared

  whether through fatigue or nervousness
due to the prolonged strain he forgot a self-
imposed rule of long standing-never to
speak french when engaged in night patrol
work a number of fabous men wore
headgear similar in shape to the tirailleurs
chechia several times he had momentarily
mistaken one of his men for the enemy a
rapid exchange of words had straightened
out the situation farel had become care-
less scrambling up the embankments of the
road into the bushes aware of the folly and
believing himself closely followed by his
men he turned to see near at hand a round
head skull cap-a blade

  we go back to the road he said in
french

  he turned to go

   a prickling sensation changing to a burn-
ing intense pain shot through him sud-
denly weak he fell on his hands and knees
the pain was repeated he thought of
tekouba left by the roadside pierced with
bayonet thrusts this was the end

  help tirailleurs-help

  he seemed to roll over and over in empti-
ness his brain reeled the harsh ground
was against his cheek his fingers clawed
weakly at the grass then a myriad tiny
lights crackled and fused before his eyes an
intense cold wrapped him sweeping through
his body like an ice-tide

   he lost consciousness

jbjfcfph the light was soft subdued a
 strange smell which he finally
identified as powerful disinfec-
tants caught his nostrils the
feel of a cool sheet over his back gradu-
ally made itself clear in his newly
aroused consciousness he tried to move
cautiously he was aware of stiffness in
his back

  sacred thunder he muttered if i

dont shake out of this ill be late-

  late for what imprecise ideas rolled
vaguely in his head slowly pictures
formed as if he were witnessing the gradual
lighting of a stage the village on the
niger bank yellow boubous tekouba lying
by the roadside his massive black head in
the meager shadow of the bushes champ-
dor- where in the name of heaven was
champdor

  and what was he doing between sheets

  i must have been wounded he thought
and this is certainly not the trail to nia-
gassola neither is it heaven-i dont
imagine they disinfect the holy precincts
nor hell therefore i was brought back
hospital niagassola yes im in nia-
gassola

  he grunted with satisfaction

  some one spoke near at hand

  do you hear lieutenant

  farel groaned an affirmative he strove
to speak but could not he realized for
the first time his extreme weakness

  the doctor  be glad to hear that
went on the voice its about time not
a word from you since you came to kayes
kayes-he was in kayes

  he must ask how long he had been ill
what his hurt was what had happened to
champdor but his brain reeled

  immeasurable space-then he felt hands
he was roughly turned upon his back
a sharp burning pain shot through him
again he opened his eyes saw first the
whitewashed ceiling then in a misty cloud
several faces bent close

  does it hurt were turning you over
to allow the wounds to supurate you
never noticed before the orderly told me
you spoke this morning

  uh-uh farel agreed

  its all right now well send you home
by the next steamer dont try to talk too
much now

  the voice dwindled hands grasped him
again turned him on his stomach the


adventure

light drifted away night came occasion-
ally some one spoke daylight night and
the torture when he was rolled over

  once heavy steps staggered by his bed
though he could not speak his hearing was
keen he heard the soles thumping down
the length of the room downstairs and
then the rasping of wood against iron fol-
lowed by the clang of iron wheel on a metal
track true some men died in the hos-
pitals that poor fellow they had him
on the little truck of the decauville narrow
gage taking him to the cemetery to be
buried

  he must talk he must ask- what had
happened

  much much later a familiar voice made
him start feebly combeau-no one else
but combeau

 you say he spoke what did he say
the colonel asked

  groan- im certain he understood
that was two weeks ago

  two weeks the shifting of light and
night so closely following-days

  doesnt seem to get better at all
does he

  hes been a long way colonel he comes
back from far well bring him through
im now certain but it will be a long
process

  ill try to talk to him anyway

  came the scraping of a chair the sound of
a heavy man sitting down farel smelled a
strong odor of tobacco combeau-he
was certain this was combeau the other
probably the doctor had called him
colonel

  farel do you hear

  uh-uh

  cant you speak

  farel tried made tremendous efforts
but he could not his other senses seemed
acute he was aware even of the slightest
noise from his bed he could see the
knees of combeaus trousers and the top
of the boots why couldnt he speak
intelligently

  i believe he understands the doctor
suggested peculiar case i dont know
whether the spears were poisoned it
seems that way affected him with a sort
of general paralysis it wont last but
we must give him time do you hear
farel youll be all right well send you
to france soon

  uh-uh

  you see colonel he hears perfectly
if you have anything to say you can be sure
he understands

  i wish to speak to him about-

  quite so-quite so--

  farel heard the doctors steps thumping
along the floor

  they say you hear and understand
farel combeau said i dont want to
worry you unnecessarily-something hap-
pened after you were wounded which you
will learn in time when you are stronger
dont worry about it my boy im leaving
the sudan for a while but wherever i
am when you need me write me ill
help you out all i can and i can do much
when i wish to just know that i who
know you better than any one else believe
in you

  what did combeau refer to what had
happened but combeau was asking him
not to worry he must not worry

  farel felt combeaus hand on his head

  i wont tire you youll understand all
this clearly when you recover

  and combeau was gone

  endless hours followed he was sud-
denly lifted to a stretcher carried down into
the courtyard placed in the rear of a
lefebvre wagon drawn by a mule

  in the wagon it was hot smelly and dark
and farel was overjoyed when the stretcher
was taken out by several blacks he heard
the tread on the gang plank caught a
glimpse of a white-and-red funnel river
steamer-he was going home he noticed
behind him many other stretchers they
filed endlessly into the deck house he
knew the boat the salamandre on her he
had come up the river on his first trip to the
sudan he already felt nearer home

  whistles the heaving of the boat he
looked at the mosquito screen two feet above

his head -shame that he could think-

it made him impatient of inaction but he
had hope that the doctor was right he
could move his feet slightly and occasion-
ally a tremor shook his fingers

  no one spoke to him during the long
trip save the orderlies and the doctor in
charge they had been informed that he
was a special case and made much of him
often the doctor would bare his torso feel
the flesh his muscles

  farel youre puzzling us do you hear
that youre fooling the faculty

  one morning the whistles shrilled again
the figurehead



and the voices of negro laborers resounded
throughout the ship saint louis du sene-
gal farel could smell salt on the wind

  now for the bad part of the voyage
he thought the trip to dakar by rail
cinders stinks and shakes

  he was pleasantly surprized the bar
of the senegal river was fordable and a
surf boat took him straight to a waiting
steamer bound for bordeaux he had a
disagreeable moment when transferred from
the bobbing boat to the ships ladder but
the muscular fisherboys with drops of water
dinging to their oily skin as to a waterproof
rubber coat swung him deftly to safety
the indefinable smells of the ship the
smells of all ships smote him with sweet
familiarity

  a cabin with other wounded men on the
bunk above and on the settee across the
way was his home for more than ten days
he was becoming used to this peculiar man-
ner of living and was even finding a certain
comfort he would have liked to smoke a
cigaret but the orderly could not or would
not understand he heard some one say
well get into bordeaux day after to-
morrow

  that was in the afternoon on the six-
teenth day out government crafts did not
make astonishing time between senegal and
france in those days it was that afternoon
that a fly landing upon farels cheek
caused him to bring up his hand

  thats an improvement he told him-
self and trembled at the sound of his own
voice

  when the orderly came in he found him
sitting up counting his fingers

  a cigaret begged farel

  the orderly fled returning with the
doctor

  what happened why are you sitting
up

  i dont know as for sitting up i think
im entitled to that after lying on my face
for how many months

  five

  have you a cigaret

  the doctor had a cigaret many cigarets
all neatly lined in a case he seemed to feel
that farel had offered a personal insult by
rising so bruskely but the next day he
did not oppose the lieutenants wish to go
out on deck the wounds in his back no
longer pained him they had closed and
healed since leaving kayes

        farel was not overstrong in
        spite of his elation after his

first walk he took others he
soon found himself strong enough
to go to the dining room for his meal there
he saw an officer lieutenant fleurac whom
he had once campaigned with near bamako

  he rushed to him with open hand-and
was brutally conscious that his enthusiasm
was not shared

  when did you get up farel fleurac
asked coolly

  a few days ago

  ah feeling well

  as well as ever the-inertia left

me without reason one minute i was stiff
the next all right

  the silence lengthened the steward
approached with various dishes several
times farel caught fleuracs eyes upon him
in an embarrassed stare while farel was
sipping his coffee fleurac gulped down his
own and made as if to rise

  farel laid a hand on his arm

  will you do me a favor old man

  yes yes of course

  tell me whats wrong with me-or with
you you look twice as serious as a thirsty
monk and roll your eyes like locomotive
headlights

  of course i dont believe a word
mumbled fleurac a word- his voice
trailed off weakly

  you and i were once pretty good friends
i assure you that i dont know any reason
for your embarrassment i have heard no
one but doctors and orderlies for heaven
knows how long im just coming to my
senses just beginning to realize who i am
and where im going i gather theres
something wrong somewhere he recalled
combeaus cautious words at the hospital
come up on deck where we can be alone
very well fleurac agreed

  farel bundled in overcoat and blankets
for the vessel was in the bay of biscay and
the weather cold joined the lieutenant on
the promenade deck

  how much do you know farel
nothing ive been practically dead
listen old man-dont get angry at any-
thing i say

  certainly not

  still fleurac hesitated

  whatever it is i ought to know farel
begged


adventure

  when the garrison at niagassola heard
that the boure mission had been attacked
the captain in command went out to offer
help and found what remained of the de-
tachment on the trail only eight hours from
town

  i knew we must have got in because
i-i found myself alive

  champdor a bloody rag about his head
unshaven riding in the lead of the resolute
group of tirailleurs was obviously in com-
mand while you farel on a stretcher
were as obviously dying there was no
time to waste in niagassola the mission
was sent on to kita while the garrison
engaged fabous men in kita champdor
made the first report of the mission

  fleurac went on to explain what ftin
that report

  the document was a masterpiece of reti-
cent blame it detailed in full the con-
troversy that had arisen between the two
lieutenants of the boure mission in the
village by the niger champdor recorded
himself as having warned farel of the ex-
treme danger arising out of fabous prox-
imity farel engrossed in his speciality
busy compiling notes for his articles had
laughed his premonitions away

  at last champdor though placed under
the orders of farel made it clear that his
responsibility did not permit him to remain
longer in the village at the mercy of an at-
tack farel had threatened him with a re-
volver risking his life for the sake of his
men champdor had quieted farel after
a long argument farel had decided that
he would assume the responsibility of his
own life while champdor retreated toward
niagassola with half the tirailleurs and the
bearers the lieutenant gave as a probable
explanation the fact that farel for several
days had been feverish from an overlong
exposure to the sun

  champdor therefore had made his de-
parture on the eve of attack progressed
northward swiftly during the next day
he had heard firing in the general direction
of the village come to the conclusion that
what he had feared had happened after
much hesitation impelled by his friendship
for farel he had decided to turn back and
help him a glance at his men convinced
him that he should give them opportunity
to rest he had been in camp when farel
materialized out of the bush with but a
handful of his section

  farel had been incoherent worried to the
point of insanity at the thought of how
his action would be considered in kayes
champdor had been forced to take the brunt
of the work even allowing farel to ride his
horse as farels own mount had been lost
in the retreat during a short halt champ-
dor had gone out to inspect the sentries
and had been struck by a stray bullet fired
into the camp by the enemy during his
short unconscious moment the bearers had
been cut up severely all night long there
had been fighting toward dawn farel dis-
appeared anxious for his safety champ-
dor sought for him and found him appar-
ently dying in the thicket farel was clad
in a tirailleurs uniform and the natural
conclusion to be drawn was that he had
been trying to escape alone fearing that
the mission was doomed

  five hours later the detachment had met
the niagassola garrison

  in the closing paragraphs of the report
champdor asked leniency for farel who
he said had been overworked and was ner-
vous given to elation and quick depression
the business of mapping keeping the troops
and bearers in order combined with the
mental labor of his special work were re-
sponsible in champdors opinion for the
surprizing breakdown of the formerly effi-
cient officer

  makam tiaba who had shown great
bravery in combat and a persistent cheer-
fulness in the face of the gravest danger
champdor recommended for the legion of
honor the black sergeant already possessing
the other decorations within the gift of the
french republic

  fleurac informed farel that in the begin-
ning the opinion in kayes was against
champdor then it developed that the
natives of the mission told the same tale of
the movement before fabous forces in
any case the questioning of negro soldiers
and bearers had to be carried on carefully
for fear of the scandal a white mans de-
fection in moment of danger would create
throughout the sudan

  it was a question of believing that farel
had broken under a terriffic strain or that
champdor was the most colossal liar of the
age the latters evident concern over the
fate of his friend his numerous sincere in-
quiries as to his health at the hospital
precluded the latter thought

  farel recalled the night champdor had
the figurehead



attempted suicide he himself had realized
that because of the disaster his decision to
stay in the village would be regarded as
foolhardy a success never has to be ex-
plained a failure always-- and champdor
had been the one to give the explanation

   then fleurac i presume ill face a court
martial when i reach france

  no its this way combeau never be-
lieved you guilty he even called champ-
dor into private conference what went on
no one knows combeau shouted angrily
his voice could be heard champdor came
out shaky but smiling and the court
martial talk ended then and there fear
of scandal-lack of absolute proof perhaps
and perhaps consideration for you because
of your splendid record previous to the
mission

  whats your opinion fleurac

  when i remember you as you were i
dont believe a -- word of the whole busi-
ness but you were under a mental strain-
its been proved by your paralysis the
doctors say you had a shock previous to
your wounds

  there was poison on the spears the
doctor in kayes believes that a poison
strong enough to keep me in a state of semi-
catalepsy for months a poison that slowly
worked out of my system i know nothing
of medicine but a good deal about native
poisons ive heard of cases similar to mine
among the blacks

  possibly but ive met champdor be-
fore he went back to france and he seems
above that sort of thing-lying what-
what could be his reason anyway

  perhaps to discredit me-

  your carnet de route campaign note
book halted with the statement that fabou
had opened fire it said nothing of in-
structions given to champdor it is a fact
that had you been calm you would have
made some note of the argument

  i had no way of knowing it would be
needed and i had other things to do

  i am only telling you what appears from
surface evidence you must realize that
this-this is very embarrassing to me
farel

  yes i realize that and i appreciate
your frankness

  i dont understand fleurac went on
and not understanding i have deferred
judgment fleurac did not seem anxious
to carry the discussion farther i have an

engagement to play cards see you again

soon-

  with that he left

farel dazed by what he had heard
leaned over the rail and stared at the foamy

crests of the waves

  champdor seemed to have covered every
angle of his story he had thought of
everything except that farel might live
an overwhelming rage rose up within him
as he recalled champdor smiling pink-
cheeked suave

  it is a police axiom that no man ever
covers his trail completely there existed
a flaw in this tissue of falsehoods but
where and how could he uncover the
proof makam tiaba knew something of
the truth he knew that permission had
been refused him to go back and help farel
but makam was a negro a non-com and
farels conduct would be generally blamed
if he caused a stink that makam tiaba
would testify for him he was certain but
how would his action be taken by the white
officers in kayes the case had never pre-
sented itself before the man who creates
a precedent is leaping in the dark

the medical board in bordeaux
kept farel in hospital for a
month his case had been pecu-
liar much discussed and he was
kept under observation

  then he was sent to the home garrison
of his regiment in toulon but before being
assigned to duty he received an unsolicited
special leave of a year being anxious to
return to africa he protested that he was
willing to cut his period of rest to six months
then the truth was gently advanced by a
kindly major he was being given this op-
portunity to gently withdraw from the regi-
ment to save himself the humiliation of
public reprimand a man as nervous as
he had proved could not be trusted im-
mediately with another command-any-
where perhaps much later when things
had settled down he could apply for service
in the meanwhile all wished him the best
of luck

  farel understood bowed and donned
civilian clothes

  he wrote to combeau who he learned
was in indo-china in charge of a division
operating against the black flags

faced with a long period of idleness with
no family save a few distant relatives

adventure

scattered throughout france farel sought
employment his excursion into the field
of ethnology had brought him into contact
with various periodicals he soon found a
position at a fair salary on the staff of a
political weekly well known for its caustic
humor

  in paris no one cared about his record in
the sudan africa was but a name to the
majority of people he met gradually he
sank into the routine of urban existence be-
came accustomed to a certain restaurant for
lunch another for dinner became a member
of a club two to four hours a day he sat
at a desk distilled sarcastic comment on
colonial subjects his assigned task smoked
numerous cigarets and exchanged impres-
sions on art women and current events
with the affable ironical fellow workers of
the office

  in a surprizingly short time his recol-
lection of africa grew dim one night on
the boulevards he met a small party of
sudanese negroes under the escort of a
colonial officer they were talking in a
dialect he should have known but he could
not understand

  combeaus reply received seven months
after his own letter had been written was
encouraging the colonel advised him that
he intended to return to france soon and
would probably be assigned to the sudan
he assured farel of his complete belief in
him farel searching his emotions for the
elation the letter should have brought was
amazed at himself the new life seemed to
have gripped him securely he doubted the
wisdom of a return to africa it were better
to let well enough alone

  months later while reading his morning
paper on the terrace of his favorite cafe he
came across combeaus name looking
closer he started

  combeau was dead

  somewhere in the bush between lang-
son and bac-le a winchester bullet from
a yellow pirates carbine- a brief sketch
of combeaus career adventurous filled
with exotic names followed with an edi-
torial comment regretting the passing of the
picturesque figure a soldier of legend

  farel recalled the massive face the strong
chin and iron-gray hair the clear piercing
eyes gone finished combeau with
combeau something of himself seemed to
have died he had been strangely linked to
the stern old fellow linked by an affection

passing the commonplace respect and ad-
miration of a subaltern for a superior officer
what was the use of hoping further

  when his leave expired he asked for a
three year extension which was granted
without demur no one cared whether he
came back or not

  not even himself

  three years not a long time when every
minute of the day is filled farel grew in
weight his face had long since lost the sun-
burn there were times when he looked in
the mirror while shaving that he wondered
if this heavy-jowled civilian with the smug
expression were himself

  he ate heartily and his knees creaked
often when he walked the suppleness of
body had long since left him he found that
he worried over the choice of a hat or the
color of a tie his greatest thrill was
reached at the races when he laid cautious
bets on favorites occasionally a twinge
of pain between the shoulders reminded him
of the past and remembering he marveled
that he had ever risked his life for anything
as intangible as an ideal

  he congratulated himself on his lucky
escape had not champdor played his little
trick he might be lying under a hastily
heaped mound rotting into nothingness

  as his extended leave drew to a close he
decided to resign definitely from the army
what was the use of remaining officially a
member what did he care in any event
for the opinion of a class of men whose
brains were as pliable as their sword scab-
bards

he awoke late on a balmy
summer day his head aching from
wine and assorted liquors ab-
sorbed in the course of the previ-
ous nights entertainment

  his evening attire crumpled in a heap on
a chair demanded attention neat a sol-
dierly habit never forgotten farel folded
the coat and opened a drawer the wrong
drawer probably because he caught sight
of his uniform coat brass buttons tarnished
with the gold-striped sleeves folded across
the breast like a dead mans hands ten-
tatively farel took out the coat then
impelled by some urge he drew it on
and tried to button it it fitted fairly
well across the shoulders but the last
two buttons refused to slip into the ap-
pointed slits
the figurehead



  he threw the garment into the drawer
and closed it with a meaning slam

  he dressed and went out the morning
was warm the sun shone on the window
panes instead of calling a cab he decided
to walk at the end of a quarter mile he
puffed but he kept on doing a bit of
serious thinking he was far from being
an old man in age but in body-in point
of view

  other men in civilian life kept fit why
not he he became aware that the man
who has once tasted action softens quickly
in the ease of city life disintegrates in
strength more than the chap who has never
lived in the open a lion tamer for farel
had friends in many walks of life now had
told him that the animals born in captivity
were stronger and healthier than those who
had been captured after tasting wild
existence

  ill do a little fencing and riding and
melt this off he thought

  he found a bundle of notes and clippings
on his desk pinned to them a piece of
paper bearing the scrawled note

cook up something salty about this we

need it to fill in slam the ruthless method of

the colonial army lay on the horror stuff thick

former nigger-killer yourself you know how

  farel smiled the colonial policy of the
government was always something to fall
back upon when news of current interest
dwindled

  leisurely he scanned the notes and clip-
pings in the fall the chambers would be
asked for a new credit for the sudan a
railway was to be built from kayes to
bamako at that time farels periodical
was backing a certain mongol-faced poli-
tician who systematically opposed colonial
growth and expenditure for that purpose
too much money was being spent on the
sudan he thought

  farel drew out paper and pen

  against his will memory assailed him-
and with it remorse he recalled officers
who had gone out not properly equipped
for a tremendous task who had died be-
cause the government seemed to believe that
extra tirailleurs cost too much money

  the sun through plate glass windows
swamped him in reminiscent warmth a
ray leaped across the polished surface of the
desk into his eyes as the light had spilled
into them long ago on the trails when the
noonday heat shimmered over smooth

rocks he glanced at the hand holding the
pen fat pink pudgy

his left hand crumpled the sheets into a
ball which he swept into the basket he
flung the pen on the inkstand and got up
from the hook behind him he took his hat
the big boss looked up surprized

  im leaving farel announced

  i can see you dont feel well the other
admitted ten tomorrow if you can id
like to have that he pointed to the papers

  you dont understand im leaving for
good

  the boss motioned to a chair

  sit down and talk it over if its a mat-
ter of salary ive been thinking for a long
time-well state any reasonable amount
youre more or less alone in your field and
you can hold me up safely whats the
trouble 

  im tired of it here and i dont want
to write stuff i dont believe

  that little one doesnt matter the
one who reads is the one to believe

  no im through farel insisted

  as you will i have no chains on you
he scribbled a few words on a piece of paper
which he handed to farel the cashier
will give you whats due you and two
months over if you decide to come back
it will support you on a much needed vaca-
tion if not its a sort of bonus a rest is
all you need i say to get such crazy notions
out of your hot head do your newly
acquired principles forbid your shaking
hands with me

  no laughed farel thank you

  he closed the door wiped his feet on the
mat and emerged into the street a free man
free he asked of himself

  his next visit was to the minister of the
navy obviously his name had been for-
gotten he was assured that he would be
permitted to reenter the naval infantry soon

  he was with true governmental psy-
chology the authorities placed farel eager
for action fired with enthusiasm in a
french garrison it took him a year to
obtain his transfer to the sudan

a fool-i was a fool to come
back

  a splendid conclusion farel
told himself for a man faced with
a two years sojourn

  but thirty-two is not twenty-seven
when five years have gone by it is difficult


adventure

to grasp the broken threads and start anew
when farel had made his decision to return
he had thought that it would be sufficient
to say i am what i was

  but he found that he had forgotten a
hundred details of army life the negro
soldiers who had been pliable in his hands
appeared to have grown dull stubborn
during his absence the sun was no longer
caressing but hit his body with a material
impact that dazed him t he who had sel-
dom been indisposed in three years of cam-
paigning went down for several days with
malarial fever soon after reaching kayes

  his habits had been shattered he knew
hours when he would gladly have ex-
changed his present lot for the old desk
when he would have abandoned the mess-
room for the dining hall of a big hotel with
music lights and all the trimmings he had
scorned his supply of cigarets gave out
quickly he could not find the same brand
in the canteen he suffered out of all pro-
portion to this slight privation he who had
lived on canned beef and boiled rice for
weeks on a stretch

  and kayes also had changed

  civilization or rather the outward ma-
terial evidence of civilization had crept up
the senegal river buildings huge when
compared to the flimsy structures that had
sheltered the french advance in farels
time loomed high above the stream the
artillery department had erected long sheds
for supplies the white traders had come
there existed several cafes on the rail-
road embankment that cut the town in
halves locomotives whistled and panted
car-wheels rattled over fish-joints

  a subtle change had taken place among
the natives the wealthier black traders
were arrogant with an absurd self-esteem
they had never possessed under the iron
grip of their own chiefs farel often en-
countered little boys books in hand minus
trousers but already well grounded in the
rights of man and citizen though less well
grounded in his duties the problem that
always arises when two races different in
color and texture of soul come together was
beginning to assume importance

  as for the warlike native chiefs there had
been several campaigns since farel left
fabou after his failure to capture the two
isolated white men had been replaced by
malinkamory another brother of samory
malinkamory in spite of his willingness to

fight met with no great success the
columns sent against him cut through his
his forces samory tired of constant de-
feat demanded peace for several months
now he had left the french alone his
armies were engaged against a native rival
fama tieba of sikosso

one afternoon his work over for
the day farel left the gallieni
pavilion where he was quartered
for a stroll along the tree-lined
avenues

  the heat was still intense but the coming
night brought with it a suggestion of a
breeze farel gained the long boulevard
parallel to the river which led to the powder
house the hospital and the cemetery the
beginning the middle and the end as he
had often remarked

  a native passing by glanced up into his
face recognized him after five years and
hailed him joyously farel shrugged to
think that he had ever considered negroes
likable that he had trusted to their in-
stinct this black no doubt would have
admired champdor

  he reached the cemetery passed between
rows of crosses and looked at names yes
so and so had got his at last by the
dates he computed which of the graves
might have been his had his military life
gone on uninterrupted the name on this
cross was that of a captain he had once
served under a genial chap with a wife
and two children farel touched his hel-
met perfunctorily

  he had an hour to kill before dinner and
so he kept on walking he passed through
a group of native huts before him chil-
dren trooped begging for a coin he sent
them away gruffly

  few white men came here probably at
this hour they were gathered about their
absinthe that was one solution of a
problem-drink one absinthe would
deepen the gloom two would lift the
spirit and by the fourth or fifth troubles
vanish

  no white men here-he was mistaken

  a second lieutenant walked ahead of him
the single gold stripe scintillating on each
sleeve evidently he was not easily af-
fected by the heat for he wore a dark
broadcloth uniform and high boots farel
was surprized at the mans bulk and the
stately step he glanced at the great
the figurehead



hands in white cotton gloves dress gloves
decidedly the fellow went in for show

  impelled by a longing for companionship
farel hastened his step reached the white-
helmeted figure

  its a warm day he suggested for
want of a better remark

  quite warm remarked the other turn-
ing toward him

  farel started the second lieu tenant
was black one of the few commissioned
officers of his race

  im glad to see you again lieutenant
farel he said gravely

  makam tiaba

  i did not hope to see you again lieu-
tenant  hey told me you had gone for
good

  farel was surprized at tiabas ease of
expression in french at his use of the formal
you instead of thou

  i compliment you on your promotion
makam and on your french

  tiaba lifted his heavy shoulders wearily
another french mannerism

  i did not desire to become more than a
sergeant lieutenant he declared but
they said i should i was sent to dakar
where i learned french-and something of
reading and writing

  what are you doing now farel asked
say thou lieutenant tiaba begged
it will seem more like old times

  makam tiaba did not seem his good-
natured self he was evidently annoyed
art thou happy then

  not as formerly things have changed
  how

  im an officer more than other blacks
and less than a white man

  foolish reasoning tiaba chid farel
  why dost thou say that

  i cannot explain while acquiring this
rank and the knowledge of french i have
lost much my men trusted me as a ser-
geant now when there is a white man
near-by even if only a corporal of infantry
they look to him when in need my section
seems to feel that it is being discriminated
against not being commanded by a white
man

  farel knew the truth of this but he felt
genuinely sorry for tiaba who was under-
going his transformation

  theyll get used to it he consoled
as time goes more and more will blacks
become officers and the tirailleurs will

end by liking warriors of their own color to
lead them

  i doubt that tiaba protested he
pulled a metal-cased watch from his pocket
glanced at the dial then noticing farels
amused glance thou seest lieutenant
the sun is not good enough for me any more
i use a watch instead of the shadows on the
ground i have installed my home close to
here and was getting back from the bar-
racks for the evening meal i am not as
others who live in town when they become
officers farel did not comment so
makam went on wilt thou come and see
my place

  together they entered a court-yard
where thin chickens were cackling several
huts large clean occupied an angle

  thou art wealthy makam tiaba

  my pay means more to me than a white
man

  he called out and several women in gor-
geous boubous issued from the huts

  my wives then makam indicated
children of varying ages my pickins
almost enough to form a section
they wont be soldiers tiaba in-
formed him the taste for fighting is not
in them as it was in the boys of my time
they go to school	

  farel thought he discerned a note of re-
gret in his former non-coms voice

  makam tiaba suddenly left him disap-
peared into a hut that was his first de-
parture from white mans courtesy farel
was glad that the big black had preserved at
least one of his customs a departure is ex-
plained by its purpose and needs no apology

  the native officer returned soon followed
by a short woman younger than the
others and better looking

  dost thou know her lieutenant

  farel shook his head

  the woman was like other malinke wo-
men save for rather regular fine features
it was possible that he had seen her around
makams quarters years ago

  the woman giggled shrilly

  i be kalogue she announced

  allah be praised thou art grown

  in five years kalogue had become a ma-
tron another five years and she would be
aging life sped quickly for women in the
tropics

  thou wert almost a warrior once ka-
logue farel said dost thou still know
how to climb cliffs


adventure

   i catch pickin now she said proudly
 and indicated the hut

   tiaba dismissed her with a gesture

   you were gone he explained her
 village was in the region of the fighting
 i kept her with my women and married
 her

   the-the other lieutenant-did he not
 say what should be done with her

   lieutenant champdor left for france
 and gave no orders then- tiaba
 paused hesitated-i know all but i
 could not speak

   farel remembered that he had not al-
 lowed tiaba to speak to discuss champdor
 and he still felt that he had done right at
 the time

   whats past is past he declared he
 called kalogue who was volubly speaking
 to the other women probably retelling her
 exploits in the boure i promised thee a
 womans necklace once it shall be thine
 soon

   there is no need kalogue assured him
 in a dialect makam tiaba my huzband
 has already given it to me-when i spoke of
 thy promise see she held up a string
 of gold pieces for his admiration

   tiaba had redeemed his chiefs promise
 as his own-naturally it was best for
 farel to accept this added mark of loyalty-
 naturally and so nothing more was said

   again makams watch flashed from his
 pocket

   thou wilt be late for dinner lieutenant
 unless thou dost ride my horse is here

   as farel rode away he realized that the
 veil hanging between himself and the past
 was lifting makam tiaba with his frank
 manly talk had been refreshing he had
 brought up a wave of remembrance not
  memories of injustice and bitterness with
 tiabas testimony he could puncture
 champdors statements to a great extent
 but was it worth while to rake up the past
 and again the old question faced him
 unavoidable as ever true tiaba was an
 officer now his word counted but he
 was black and farel was puzzled over the
 peculiar ethics of the case

   before going up to his room he halted in
 front of the bulletin board an old habit
 telegraphic news from france was often
 posted there beside the notices and orders
 more immediately concerned with the
 military activities in the sudan

   he recalled that the list of officers to be

 assigned to the next column had been an-
 nounced for tonight

  his name was there heading the lieu-
tenants followed by sparbes and besans
besans was an artilleryman farel did not
know him well sparbes he had met re-
cently a young man not over twenty-five
farels four years out of the army and his
blurred record had kept him from being
promoted so that of the men he had known
not one was still of his rank he was
starting again at the bottom the others
had gone up and he found himself with new
arrivals perhaps the captain in com-
mand-

  he looked closer at the paper

  he had half expected what he saw

gustave champdor

  he neither started nor cursed he could
see the name as it had looked in combeaus
clear writing on the letter he had received
in kita then it had struck him with a
premonition of evil

  why was champdor returning why
had he himself come back had he been a
fool

  perhaps not

it had been his custom since
his arrival to ascend to the mason-
ry terrace for his after-dinner
smoke

  the gun platform in the dim glow of the
new moon seemed an islet detached from
the rest of the universe and suspended in
the limpid sky midway between the gleam-
ing river and the stars the silhouette of a
sentry vague could be glimpsed at the far
end the metal of the hotchkiss quick-
firers glowed like dull silver in the pools of
shadow cast by the mountings

  a tall form in white tunic and trousers
with the glowing tip of a cigaret growing
and dwindling at each puff approached
farel recognized sparbes the lieutenant he
was to aid in the handling of the tirailleurs
when the column set out sparbes was
gaunt elongated with an exaggerated
length of arms and legs a long mustache
split his face in two causing him to resemble
a hungry cat

  am i disturbing you he asked
want to be alone

  no farel held up his cigaret just
finishing this
the figurehead



  youre queer these days offered spar-
bes thoughtfully

 how-queer

 in turn gloomy and elated in -

half the time seeing angels the rest judg-
ing by your expression

  an observing turn of mind yours
farel said light

  not as a rule retorted sparbes but
when i see a fellow like you fretting i
wonder if theres anything i can do to help
him out

  farel was not surprized for two weeks
he had been almost constantly with sparbes
busy clearing up the immense detail work
that accompanied the sending out of a
column farel liked sparbes half amused
half interested he had perceived sparbes
growing friendship after a first period of
doubt he had heard perhaps all this
without a word spoken of the past sparbes
was too young to conceal his inner thoughts
farel now put him at ease

 youve heard things against me
sparbes you were told that i was an un-
trustworthy sort of fool

  brutally put thats it but ill tell you

right now i dont give a - for what

any one says

  experience will teach you that you are
absolutely wrong there there is never
smoke without fire i merely inform you of
that general fact with all due regard for
your youthful impulsiveness and loyalty
i have been in the habit of forming my
own opinions since i was permitted to don
trousers i have seen more then a little of
you in the last few days and-well you
know what i mean

  i think i do

  what monstrous juggling of facts went
on i can not tell sparbes said hinting for
farels side of the story

  im in a difficult position id rather
not talk without proof

  even to me

  even to you

  thats what lost you farel first you
couldnt talk then you didnt

  it was a matter between white men
sparbes seemed about to speak then
deferring to farels expressed wish he re-
mained silent

  champdor is in town i believe farel
said

  yes in the building had dinner with
the commander-in-chief tonight i came

up to tell you the others are talking won-
dering what will happen when you meet

  im going down now then-

  when they entered the room farel be-
came aware of a sudden stop in the conver-
sation behind him he could hear an ex-
pectant rustle from the men who had fol-
lowed unwilling to miss the meeting be-
tween the two officers of the boure mission

  champdor was in the midst of a group of
officers and perfectly at ease his figure
still held the suggestion of tremendous
vitality his new uniform gold braid at
shoulders and sleeves the embroidered
regimental number at the coat collar stood
out as conspicuously among the baggy whites
as did his smooth pink skin among the
faces tanned by the too strong sun or yel-
lowed by fever

  aware of the sudden silence champdor
glanced about him saw farel near the
doorway

  without a trace of embarrassment or
emotion he strode across the floor hand
outstretched

  glad to see you again farel

  good evening captain champdor
farel replied lieutenant sparbes mon
capitaine our comrade

  i have asked for another officer
champdor announced after acknowledging
sparbes salute and shaking his hand i
have been granted two companies and
thought it advisable to have a third in-
fantry officer a native sub-lieutenant
fresh from dakar i hear

  while he spoke heels pounded carelessly
on the threshold the hum of voices had
lifted again the long-looked-for meeting
between champdor and farel was over

  i think you already know him farel
went on makam tiaba who was ser-
geant in our days

  tiaba champdor continued to be
unruffled an excellent fellow if i recall
rightly

  farel for the first time noticed that
champdors hair at the temples was gray
almost white that was the sole change

  we will not delay long in kayes the
captain informed his lieutenants know-
ing you i am certain that everything has
been attended to

  farel bowed his acknowledgement of the
compliment

  that was all a few commonplace re-
marks and champdor took leave returned


adventure

to the group he had been talking with when
farel entered the room

  not at all what i expected sparbes
said after they had passed through the
outer veranda

  what did you expect

  i believed he would be nervous he-
he seems quite a decent sort

  farel nodded

  he seems- sparbes rectified

  so sparbes had at first been impressed
by champdors genial manner farel
was grateful for the subtle correction
here at least was a man who went
behind the first effect of champdors mag-
netic charm admitted that which was
apparent-and reserved judgment on the
character

  and hes to be in command sparbes
resumed i think many things will be
clear before this column gets back

 the column under champdor was to
move against ahmadou cheikou king of
the tukuleurs

  while the french were engaged against
samory ahmadou had interfered with
the commerce of the newly acquired ter-
ritories he had permitted his men to
halt both the land caravans and the
canoes that sought to travel down the
niger to segou repeated demands for
consideration had been laughed at one
of ahmadous leaders had declared that
the protests of the french concerned him
less than a mosquito buzzing near his
ears so that to uphold the nations
dignity ahmadou cheikou must be chas-
tised there was also the incidental fact
to be considered ahmadou held land that
france wanted

  the first part of the route of the column
was identical with that followed by the
boure mission passing from kayes to
bafoulade then through kita and niagas-
sola on to niafadie ending at siguiri but a
short distance from the village where farel
had fought fabou

  at siguiri two eighty-millimeter moun-
tain cannon under besans the sub-lieu-
tenant of artillery would arrive from ba-
mako to join the outfit there too
champdor would find his supplies and
bearers to transport them with a full
supply train and the two guns champdor
then would follow the left bank of the
niger toward the territory of segou where
ahmadou had massed his men

they passed the spot where fa-
rel had been wounded then where
champdor had tried to end his life
the captain had not said a word
the expression of his face had not changed

  when the column marched into siguiri
champdor was informed that the expected
bearers had not been gathered there were
reasons for the failure of the officials to ob-
tain the numerous bearers needed by a
column of champdors importance

  for nearly ten years the country had
been devastated by swarms of armed men
bearers had been requisitioned in great
numbers during that time many had died
at the task the survivors asked for noth-
ing except to be allowed to till their land in
quiet neither promises of reward nor
appeals to their loyalty to the french
stirred them to action they had learned
that the bearers life was not a bed of roses
a heavy burden which wore the scalp raw
lash-blows from the overseers when there
were no white men about the risk of being
slain by the swarming riders of the native
chiefs combatting the french-that was
the bearers lot the money compensa-
tion although considerable was not suffi-
ciently tempting

  champdor was informed however that
between niagassola and niafadie he could
find all the bearers he desired the captain
could well ask why he had not been in-
formed of the fact while passing those
towns he was forced to accept the situa-
tion as it was not as it might have been

  the last expedition against samory had
freed a horde of captives toughened to the
head-loads and not yet attached to homes
by the possession of land these men
would be glad to resume for pay the work
they had formerly done for nothing

  thereupon farel and sparbes were sent
back to recruit them

  the work was absurdly easy not only
were the men willing to go but they would
take their families with them as they had
done under samory for every bearer
engaged farel thus obtained several unpaid
substitutes the mens wives who would re-
lieve the lord and master of his head-load
part of the time thereby keeping the trans-
portation gang fresh also the presence
of women and children would prevent de-
sertion should trouble develop family
loyalty is a strong instinct in the suda-
nese negro
the figurehead



  the trip to nagassola would have been
eventless had not sparbes while examining a
new sporting gun lacerated his thumb in
the lever farel knowing how an appar-
ently insignificant hurt could develop if not
attended to coaxed him to consult the doc-
tor of the outpost

   the toubib doctor a good-natured fellow
thirty-five years old at the most was the
possessor of a black beard of extraordinary
length admired by negroes who measure
distinction by inches of chin ornament
he had been at the post two years and
was much interested in sudanese plant life
confessing to having published several
papers in a medical magazine farel told
him of many popular beliefs concerning the
herbs used by the fetish-men to cure illness
and to poison their enemies

   during the conversation the doctor took
the time to open a large book and write
casually

  are you writing about my thumb
sparbes asked curiously

  yes and the nature of your wound
it is herein recorded that sparbes achille
lieutenant in the first sudanese tirailleurs
and presumed to know a rifle from a pitch-
fork injured his hand on a carbine you
can never live that down

   farel looked up

  do you always do that i mean is it
just a habit with you or do all toubibs keep
a record

   all military doctors yes with us out
here it serves a double purpose we can
say at a glance who among the tirailleurs
were allowed off duty while sick and when
we can compare the result of various treat-
ments on similar cases

   how long have the records at this post
been kept

  i dont know probably ever since the
beginning theyre left here to help the
next chap

   is the register for - here in niagas-
sola

   should be

   could i have a look at it

   why the doctor asked curiously
during that year i was brought into this
post on a stretcher id be curious to see
what the immediate verdict was

  the doctor rubbed his palm over his
high forehead

   i dont know whether its quite regular
   -how much of a private document it is

he objected at first but i dont see the
harm i guess none of the others are over-
modest concerning their ailments

   he got up and went to a closet in a corner
of the white-washed room fumbled with
several large books glancing at the dates

   he handed farel the requested record

  while farel turned the pages sparbes
engaged the loquacious doctor in conversa-
tion asking details on the further treatment
of his wound

farel raoul lieutenant boure mission

  the entry mentioned that farel had lost
much blood that the spear thrusts in-
terested in all probability vital organs and
that he had no chance of recovery in fact
the notation finished with the remark that
the lieutenant could not survive twenty-
four hours

champdor gustave lieutenant boure mission

   farel had found what he was looking for

  he knew that champdor with a bloody
bandage around his head could not have
avoided medical attention according to
record champdor had suffered from a lacer-
ation of the scalp near the right temple
the skin was burned the hair singed the
missile had evidently been fired de bas en
haut from below upward

   farel closed the book and returned it to
the doctor

  the twenty-four hours granted me
threaten to become twenty-four years

   we have a record that beats yours the
doctor offered about the time of the
boure mission a black was brought in-a
chief his men had picked him up on the
trail and knowing there was a doctor here
surrendered him to save his life he was
like a sieve bayonet wounds all over his
chest they tell me you could cover five
of them with one hand and he lived
hes around somewhere settled down be-
cause he said he couldnt fight us after
what wed done for him

   tekouba

    thats the fellow say is there any one
you dont know around here

   i was at one time tolerably well ac-
quainted farel then told of his encounter
with the native leader i granted te-
kouba his life as if to reward me who-
ever pulls the strings that makes us dance
like puppets through this existence allowed
me to live after suffering similar wounds


adventure

a sort of offering to fate the way the fe-
tishists make sacrifices to their wooden
gods the longer one lives in this land
the less one scorns the customs

  when at last they left the doctor sparbes
was the first to speak

  you found out something-i saw your
face change thats why i kept him in-
terested

  then farel told sparbes-everything

  it was a relief to break the long silence he
had imposed upon himself he could speak
now he had a proof a white mans proof

  if a single lie can be proved the whole
report falls down doesnt it

  obviously sparbes agreed you can
bring things out anytime now what are
you going to do put your case in the
hands of the major at siguiri

  with champdor under suspicion he
would not be allowed to retain command
as his accuser i would be sent back the
rainy season would be on before new men
could besent down the blacks would notice
the withdrawal of officers and wonder-then
matters would take an unhealthy turn
and yet champdor is not fit to com-
mand

  we will be three white men on his staff
including besans makam tiaba will be
there also champdor i believe thinks
much of his ability he knows it was
makam and not he who conducted the
mission after i was truffled the four
of us can guide him make him do the right
thing you know we are going to employ
auxiliaries nativeallies he makes a splen-
did figurehead better we must admit
than either of us after his usefulness is
over then- he broke off glanced at
sparbes cold-blooded you think his
treatment of me held nothing of friendly
warmth i dislike him speaking mildly
an eye for an eye eh

  something of the kind

  you seem to hold the belief that revenge
is a dish to be eaten cold

  ive waited five years farel reminded
him

hurry sacred sons of
camels besans the artillery
officer encouraged his men

the native gunners grinned as
they unhitched the mules from the limbers
a little friendly cursing set them at ease
the stumpy mountain-guns were hauled

by hand behind a convenient rise of earth

  farel who had halted his horse nearby
turned in the saddle and saw the somber
lines of tirailleurs dotted with red chechias
swinging into position the colorful dis-
orderly mass of the native allies bambaras
and bondukes scrambled forward in turn
split into brooklets of men which seeped
into depressions for shelter

  before farel the mules of the artillery
passed trotted out of rifle range the
indistinct rumor of voices swelled then he
saw besans leaning over the guns fumbling
with the controls a breach swung open
the gleaming cylinder of a shell caught the
sun vanished into the gaping tube with
a metallic clang the breech snapped shut
besans straightened up gestured to champ-
dor who was ten yards away on his horse

  the captain nodded

  what time is it besans asked of
farel

   eight-fifteen

  at nine the panorama over there will
be considerably altered

  six hundred yards away the massive
red and white walls of besedougou straggled
on the flank of a hill of different heights
built on various levels they added to the
picturesquesness of the scene the diom-
foutou a bit of sudanese fortification that
corresponds well with the castle-keep of feu-
dal days reared its angular distorted sides
at the eastern end of the town a gigantic
cotton-wood tree a mass of foliage etched
against the blue sky dominated the town

  besedougou was the first of ahmadous
strongholds in the path of the column
garrisoned not only by the paid troops of
the tukuleur king but serving as a shelter
for numerous raiding bands fled to cover at
the approach of the french the position
was a powerful one moreover it controlled
the trails between segou and nioro ac-
cording to champdors instructions bese-
dougou was the most important objective
if he destroyed the stronghold he would
have done his share a larger column the
following dry season would move toward
segou to effect the actual conquest

  farel knew that ahmadou was not in
besedougou but that he had charged dia-
kate a warrior of reputation with the de-
fense in spite of this if besedougou fell
a great blow would be struck at ahmadous
prestige already somewhat damaged by his
previous defeats
the figurehead



  how long will it take you to make a
hole for us farel asked of besans

  by four in the afternoon ill have a
breach

  champdor field-glasses high was scan-
ning the soil between his position and the
walls on a white horse in a white flannel
uniform as well cut as a full-dress tunic
epaulettes fringing the shoulders the gold
anchor of the naval infantry shimmering on
the tall helmet like a star he was as farel
had said a splendid figurehead

  open fire besans he called

  watch the tree besans said to farel
im using it as a landmark

  besans did not know that the cotton-
tree was regarded by the superstitious
natives as the guardian of their dwellings

  first piece-fire chanted besans

  the nearest gun crashed the servers
promptly dragged it back into place after
the recoil a dozen yards to the side of
the tree and as many too short the shell
landed on the roof of a hut a yellow puff
of smoke materialized out of nowhere
flashes winked like concentrated lightning
the smoke vanished and dust rose from the
pulverized walls

  second piece-fire

  a better shot branches rained down
a clamor of astonishment rose from the
town rifles were fired from the walls
the bombardment continued besans af-
ter each discharge grumbled when his men
were compelled to drag the guns back into
firing position

  five hundred years of artillery he said
and nothing done to save the recoil
we call ourselves civilized

  once the range was found the shells
dropped with mathematical precision on
the point of the wall designated by champ-
dor as the likeliest spot for access besans
varied the performance with an occasional
shrapnel deposited in the reserves of war-
riors in the open places it was hardly
fair thought farel this artillery prepara-
tion he would have felt better perhaps
if the natives had possessed cannon a
good siege-mortar squatting on the ram-
parts would have made the engagement
more interesting

  farel champdor called out beckoning

  captain farel asked when he had
drawn nearer

  i want your opinion farel i received
instructions before leaving kayes and i

dont believe they apply here but they
have to be tried out

  farel shrugged imperceptibly same
champdor wanting responsibility shared
when the burden was on him

  i have orders to use our allies exclusively
in storming parties the authorities wish
to save the tirailleurs i have been speak-
ing with the chiefs of the auxiliaries and
they claim their men will not go forward
against the tukuleurs without a white man
to lead

  that was to be expected

  makam tiaba tells me that without the
tirailleurs the assault will fail that the
white man will be abandoned if wounded
what do you think

  the difference between the bambaras
under their own chiefs and our tirailleurs
is a sense of duty the bambaras are
brave-but tiaba is right unless the
soldiers show them the way they will not
push the assault to a conclusion and the
white man in charge has a good chance of
being killed or deserted in midfield the
natives are still awed by the reputation of
el hadj omar amadous father and hold
the tukuleurs in superstitious dread
nevertheless i must try to carry out
my orders i will send sparbes

  why sparbes such a choice is usually
made by alphabetical order f is before
s it seems to me

  champdor met farels eyes

  there are reasons why i can not decently
place you in a dangerous post

  i will relieve you of all remorse captain
i demand to lead the auxiliaries its my
job by rights and sparbes should not be
made to suffer for our private-disagree-
ment

  regardless of any authority i may hold
i couldnt send sparbes forward without
telling you my reason you realize the-
the position i am in champdor said un-
expectedly i wanted you to make the
choice

  it is agreed then

  agreed

  farel left him and sought the chiefs of
the auxiliaries as he talked to them he
realized that they were afraid to storm the
walls without the aid of the tirailleurs
the bambaras were not as reluctant as the
bondukes these last in spite of the
bravery they had shown against mah-
madou lamine at macadiacounda were


adventure

extremely nervous they had been brought
into segou far from their homes and even
ousman gassi their commander was per-
turbed

  we came in the belief that we would
but help the tirailleurs he declared
as for me i shall take no part in the fight
i have risked my life for the french enough
if thou canst make my men fight do so
this was frank categorical

  mourdia the bambara leader did not
refuse to go forward in person the tuku-
leurs of ahmadou were his enemies and his
men although disturbed by the failure of
the soldiers to support them would do their
best

  at three-thirty in the afternoon farel
marshaled the native allies opposite the
steadily widening breach he would charge
on foot refusing to make a target of him-
self looking at the men behind him he
knew that they would fail but champdor
in this case was right instructions must
be obeyed before another course could be
tried out

  makam tiaba blue tunic sparkling with
decorations high boots shining with a mir-
ror-like polish a pipe-clayed helmet on his
head breast criss-crossed with leather
straps supporting revolver and field glasses
lacking not a single item of his ranks desig-
nation and privilege hovered near scowling
thoult be slain he repeated is

the captain-

  farel cut him short with a gesture
captain champdor is following orders
i will watch thee lieutenant surely
he will not have time to prevent my helping
thee should i be needed

  until then theres nothing to be said
  champdor had come forward

  i want to speak to you farel he
dismissed tiaba this is possibly my
last chance to speak i have delayed until
now-why i can not say i want to tell
you that i-im sorry

  a trifle late

  but not too late one of us may be

killed today-

 you and i have a-good idea who

that will be farel pointed out dryly

  you never can tell dont make it hard
for me to speak when we reached niagas-
sola the doctors said you would die you
had no family-nothing credit is of no
use to a dead man it meant everything to
me i was tempted-

  i realize you didnt take much of a
chance farel admitted ironically

  dont think i didnt feel remorse this
thing has been on my mind for five years
on mine also

  i was half crazy-wholly crazy

  thats the most charitable conclusion
  i-ill settle it some day

all right farel said impatiently
the time to come out and settle things was
when you found out i was alive dont
annoy me now with your belated sorrow
let me go on

  i wont waste time listening to your
hypocritical regrets farel almost shouted

  i wish i could take your place this after-
noon

  so do i probably more than you do
he turned to go

  i have something more to say-

  -you farel concluded

  champdors whining had stirred a deeper
resentment he hated the captain with
an intense fiery hatred this last scene
was in keeping with the rest he had
lacked the courage to give the order for
farel to lead the assault but he had had
the courage to ask forgiveness when he
farel was going-to almost certain death
sparbes had come out to bid him luck
you know that matter i spoke about
in niagassola sparbes if i croak out
there take it up for me

  dont worry i will

  champdor hovering near for a few mo-
ments went back to his post of observation

  good luck eh and dont be obstinate
sparbes advised if you see you cant
make it come back for the tirailleurs

  all right-so long i
  sparbes left

  behind farel the cannon still resounded
but the shells were no longer beating the
walls the diomjoutou was at the receiving
end

  the lieutenant threw his cigaret away
drew his sword and placed it under his left
arm

  na na he cried come on come on
a half-hearted shout answered his cry
but he started forward gradually increas-
ing his stride he half-turned saw that
he was followed by the swarm of multi-
colored boubous both mourdia the bam-
bara chief and the leader of the bondukes
assigned by ousman gassi rode magnifi-
cent horses
the figurehead



  yet farel knew that the real issue rested
on him

  from the walls the fusillade opened
furiously tremendous cries went up
the tukuleurs were rejoicing to have an
opportunity to fight after the enforced
passivity under the bombardment the
afternoon sun was behind farel sent his
shadow sprawling ahead at each long leap
the walls of besedougou were suffused with
a red glow rifle barrels shone through
the thin cloth the lieutenant felt the glow
on his back the glow he had craved he
was strangely content that this should be
his last sensation

  at almost the same moment both mour-
dia and the bonduke chief rolled to the
ground with their horses mourdia arose
but the other remained where he had fallen
a gorgeous blotch of red and white over
which twinkled the naked legs of the at-
tackers the bambara gained his white
chiefs side the heavy dull tinted blade of
his curved saber jutting from his huge
clenched fist

  the gaping hole torn by the guns in the
barrier of walls was not far now warriors
knelt in the passage firing

  farel was on the verge of accomplishing
the supposedly impossible he was bringing
a charge of irregulars to its objective under
plunging rifle fire a test of discipline for
trained troops

  where a white man led blacks would ever
follow

an impact whirled farel
about threw him headlong

  attempting to get to his feet
he fell back heavily his left
leg was a dead weight now and a stabbing
pain shot through his bowels he rolled
on his side called out to the auxiliaries to
go on-a useless order the negroes had
turned their backs to the wall the moment
they realized he had fallen

  the entire party was in headlong flight
boubous snapping in the wind the entire
party he had been unjust he felt him-
self being lifted it was mourdia the bam-
bara chief living up to his title

  mourdia had no time for speech he
hoisted farel to his shoulder holding him
about the legs and trotted after his faithless
followers farel who faced the rear saw
the tukuleurs firing in his direction af-
ter a brief hesitation a number of them

crossed the debris clogging the breach
and raced into the open the white
man was a prize worth straining for
he reached for his revolver in spite of
his awkward position but the weapon
had slid from the holster

  his spirit was well tempered and did not
fail him if it was his turn to pass on it
was his turn somehow he regretted his
last words to sparbes facing death his
own personal problem faded into unim-
portance compared to the magnitude of the
work to be done

  burdened with the white officer mourdia
was tiring fast his step faltered his
breath came and went in lung-tearing
gasps in the excitement the tukuleur
marksmen failed to find their mark as
always they fired too high

  abruptly he found himself among the
tirailleurs the well known crackling of
the gras rifles sounded close by mourdia
lowered him to the ground and dropped
down himself his body shaking with fatigue
and breathlessness

  makam tiaba the scowl of battle on his
face knelt beside the lieutenant

  much sick he asked forgetting his
better french for the bush-talk of the
non-com

  belly- whispered farel

  he had looked down and seen his trous-
ers and the lower part of his tunic red with
blood makam unbuckled the broad belt
bared farels stomach and thighs then
seeing that the white man had no helmet
removed his own the hottest sun could
not injure makams wool-protected cra-
nium

  he resumed his inspectioitwith cautious
fingers

  no be belly he announced in a relieved
tone

  farel learned that he had been hit in the
groin a nasty wound but not necessarily
fatal makam tiaba tore the lieutenants
linen shirt formed a wad which he pressed
over the bleeding hole and pulled up the
trousers

  no bleed no more he said and he in-
formed farel that he had not waited for
orders but had started out to help as soon
as the white man fell

  that the captain approved his native
subalterns move was soon apparent an-
other section of tirailleurs came out to
support makam four tirailleurs lifted


adventure

farel and slowly carried him back to the
rear

  and the three white men came out to
meet him

in the tent shared by sparbes
and farel besans who lay
claim to some knowledge of sur-
gery extracted the bullet his
unskilled hands probing with the forceps
caused the wounded man intense torture
but at last the artillery man stood up
wiped a bullet on a towel

  what do you think of that he suddenly
exclaimed

  the missile identical in shape to the
breach loading ammunition the side
grooved by rifling was a bright silver

  i should be quite honored farel said
silver bullets are used against fetish-
priests chiefs reputed to be invulnerable
and marabouts the tukuleurs must hold
us in dread

  besans grinned

  on the off chance that more than one
was fired at you ill comb the grounds
after besedougou is taken one way of
making a fortune this one will make a
nice watch charm

  no ill give it to mourdia for an
amulet-silver bullet dipped in the blood
of a chief watch

  mourdia summoned from the outside
where he had been seated with makam
tiaba entered and was informed of the
gift he accepted the bullet with trem-
bling fingers at that price he would risk
his life every day a marvelous grisgris and
tobacco-white mans tobacco

  whals the verdict besans farel
asked after the bambara had left

  bad hole nasty place you cant
walk or ride youre due for a stretcher
ride to kayes and two months on your
back

u

  if you move your left leg at all the
wound will open think yourself lucky
that youll get over it an inch or so higher
and your bowels would have been per-
forated

  you certainly play in bad luck sparbes
remarked

  besans looked askance at this reference
to farels last wounds sparbes realizing
that he had trampled on a dangerous sub-
ject became embarrassed

  as for champdor he smiled

  hes not as badly off this time he
declared when he was picked up on the
niagassola trail he was as good as dead
the leisurely tone the genial smile
seemed natural enough farel contrasted
this self-control in the presence of witnesses
and the agitated pleading manner before
the charge

  besans left soon to attend to the guns
and sparbes went out to inspect the new
line formed when makam tiaba had moved
forward

  im glad you returned alive farel
without going into any other reason let
this suffice had you been killed some
would have been found to say i had sent
you to your death

  and why should you wish to do that
farel asked

  champdor did not answer the question
i have tried to carry out my instructions
and failed he said thoughtfully you
said once i was not cut out for a soldier-
what should i do now send the tirail-
leurs ahead

  not this afternoon

  why not

  they have just seen a charge shattered
and a white man hurt the auxiliaries
would not support them so soon after
that disastrous first rush

  i counted ninety-five corpses between
here and the breach champdor said
i realize that the sight of them rattled
our men we could drop shrapnel into

the town-

  our ammunition wouldnt hold out
moreover shrapnel fired against enemies
under cover accomplishes little the few
casualties that would result would not
lessen the odds against us to any extent
wed better save the shrapnel to use during
the attack when the warriors will come out
into the open to await us pointed out
farel the tukuleurs in besedougou
are encouraged now and our men are de-
pressed let the night pass with morn-
ing a new day will come negroes forget
quickly the defeat of today has nothing
to do with tomorrows fight strange
reasoning but how else did samory keep
his warriors in the field

  knowing me knowing conditions would
you advise me to risk sparbes

  no frankly sparbes is intelligent
brave with a world of confidence in his
the figurehead

i

own ability he must not be risked
dont tell him i said so hes hot-headed
enough to claim going forward as a right
besans

  is a splendid artilleryman but prob-
ably not capable of handling the column

  i am in command therefore not at
liberty to-to do as i desire with myself
there is left-makam tiaba do you

think-

  i do try him in the morning

  thank you farel

  he was leaving but farel spoke up
tomorrow have me carried out to see
the action will you

  if it wont be harmful-

  it will do me less harm than fretting
in here

  all right

  without another word champdor left
farel spent a bad night his wound
pained him he could not move without
waking when he did sleep his mind was
filled with dreams fantastic imaginings
made up of all the events that had occured
since he left kita for boure

  he led the natives in nightmare charges
against unseen enemies suddenly discov-
ered himself following a scantily clad ka-
logue through the paris streets and into
the office where he had worked a news-
paper kiosk sprung up in a deserted su-
danese plain with huge placards he
could discern the headlines champdor
column massacred in segou

  he was transported into the chambers
where fantom deputies held rambling
speeches the leader of the opposition to
colonial expansion bristling mustache and
low brow was suddenly discovered to be
wearing the gorgeous boubou of the dead
bonduke leader the figure moved and
as it moved was changed into combeau
laughing juggling with a silver bullet and
pointing to a hole in his forehead what
farel had thought to be a silver bullet
turned out to be a bugle which combeau
lifted to his lips and blew

  the wounded man awoke with a start
the bugles were sounding the morning call

  the camp was alive with noises the
cooks were chopping firewood the uproar
of native voices swelled on the cot beside
him sparbes awoke in his turn stretched
and yawned he rubbed his eyes sleepily
and dressed from some distance away
came the excited cackling of a chicken the

piercing laughter of tirailleurs a fowl
destined to the white officers table was
doubtless running for life

  one would think oneself in a farm yard
grumbled farel

  sparbes turned

  awake how do you feel

  rotten

  all in a life time i presume it will be
my turn today

  i hope not but if you get hit pick out
a better place than i did i wouldnt
recommend the groin to my worst enemy
dont worry sparbes went on lacing
his boots champdorll not put himself
in the way of anything unpleasant

  the mountain-guns had opened fire
champdor fully equipped thrust his
head within the tent inquired how farel
felt if he had overheard sparbes remark
he was remarkably calm

  ill send some men for you farel he
announced makam tiaba will go for-
ward

  when he had withdrawn sparbes gave
vent to his feelings

  i dont give a-if he heard me he

declared a man has no business snoop-
ing about what is this new thing tiaba
being given command of the attack
probably wishes to feel the ground be-
fore risking you hes in a bad fix if he has
no one to depend on

  if he has thought that out by himself
he has more brains than i gave him credit
for

  the men promised by champdor arrived
with a stretcher farel was taken into the
open on the platform used by champdor
as an observation post the top of the
stretcher was braced against a tree trunk

  beside the breach made the day before
another hole was soon pounded by the
mountain-guns a few hundred yards away
the sections of tirailleurs formed up
makam tiaba was conspicuous gesturing
scolding

  to farel the soldiers seemed slothful
lacking their customary dash sparbes
noticed this as well

  what ails them he wondered
  nervous

they wont make it predicted sparbes
theyve accomplished harder feats
the companies here were engaged against
samory a score of times the tukuleurs
dont frighten them


adventure

  then theyre giving a good imitation of
fear

  makam tiaba had at last succeeded in
pushing every man into place by gestures
he ordered them to spread out to fix bay-
onets the gleaming blades sprouted swift-
ly at the end of the rifles

  champdor lifted a whistle to his lips and
shrilled three calls

  makam tiaba repeated the signal lifted
his hand and the lines made the first move
forward in a half dozen bounds the first
cover was reached a line of bushes running
parallel with the walls

  not bad no one hit sparbes ap-
proved

  the native officer stood up again and
lifted his hand to his face the tirailleurs
advanced swiftly from cover to cover the
first man was struck brought both hands
to his stomach struggled on a few feet and
fell the others kept on

  the next leap is a bad one farel said

  the ground there was level with the walls
and the discharges spread horizontally as
he had expected several tirailleurs dropped
immediately some lay where they fell
others crawled back toward the rear
makam tiaba who now scorned to crouch
and stood in full view was untouched

  the quick piercing whistle again this
time the tirailleurs did not move

  tiaba walked back to the nearest man
lifted his sword and struck with the flat
the fellow got up and advanced reluc-
tantly but when tiaba turned away he
sank back to the earth

  theyre funking sparbes shouted

  tiaba was manifestly haranguing the
tirailleurs to no avail not one would
make the move the native sub-lieuten-
ant drew his revolver

  what can we expect of the auxiliaries if
the regulars quit yelled sparbes

  the captain brought the whistle to his
lips but this time he signaled makam
tiaba to withdraw an order that was
obeyed with alacrity

  from besedougou came mocking shouts
the warriors dancing with joy could be
plainly discerned

  im going to see whats wrong sparbes
sputtered of all the rotten shows-i
cant understand it those fellows are
veterans

  he galloped down the hillside across the
flat stretch toward makam tiaba farel

saw him halt beside the negro sub-lieutenant
what he said was evidently not compli-
mentary for makam gestured helplessly
champdor approached breathlessly
they wont go forward he said

  do you know why

  afraid

  they want a white man thats all
they dont trust an officer of their own
color strange thing-the troopers will
perform under a non-com of their race but
put stripes on the same fellow and they go
to bits

l i never heard of it

  the evidence is there

  would they follow sparbes

  they would farel looked champdor
squarely in the eyes they would also
follow you

  you think i should-

  what we said yesterday still holds true
in case anything happens to sparbes
neither you nor besans are capable of
handling the tirailleurs i may seem
rough but this is a rough situation
sparbes gone we would find ourselves be-
fore besedougou in the heart of an hostile
country with auxiliaries and regulars de-
pressed by repeated checks

  which would mean

  disaster

  but as you say i dont know enough to
lead troops what good will i be-this
time

  there is no need for maneuvering
what they need is a leader a figurehead to
look up to without unduly flattering you
i can say you are that they admire you
and would follow you more readily than
they would sparbes-or me

  champdor bit his lips and looked down
at the ground again the pallor that
farel had noticed before at the mention of
danger crept over his face but when he
turned to the lieutenant again he was calm
enough even smiling

  its pretty clear that im the one to go
he said

  certainly we can not withdraw at this
time and make ourselves a laughing stock
in the sudan

  champdor sat down beside farel

  thats what i came out here for to
prove myself something else than what my

behavior previously has shown me-

  your reputation is sound champdor
live up to it now
the figurehead



i mean i wished to prove myself to my-
self-and to you i have brooded over the
matter so long that the world seems com-
posed of but two individuals-you and i
unfortunately it isnt

  i think i can bluff my way through
farel-but im-afraid

  any man would be frightened before
what you will undertake all you need is a
little more strength of will to conceal the
fact

  ill go farel and ill be there try-
ing-

  farel extended his hand

  you have it in you to do anything the
imagination that caused you to break be-
fore danger can help you to disregard it
possibly

  champdor arose slowly and walked to-
ward his horse farel called him back

  i want to tell you something champdor
-i admire you now ill tell you more i
intended to bring up the whole mess our
mess again i have witnesses kalogue
makam tiaba tekouba moreover i
found in niagassola the written proof that
you lied about your wound if it will make
you more at ease now you can tell yourself
that when you come back from besedougou
ill forget all that

  its inhuman to forget-a thing like
that champdor replied ill go ahead
thats no more than youve done uncon-
ditionally

  it isnt what youre about to do now
champdor i decided to drop the matter
yesterday-out there

 why

  i dont exactly know i felt how small
i was how small you were how tiny all
men are beside the great things that count-
a country a flag-and harming either even
to gratify my little ego would be a crime
country flag resounding words
champdor commented i think i under-
stand he broke out laughing not a

nervous laugh by - it works that

imagination business i feel in me the soul
of a warrior

  sitting straight in the saddle for he had
mounted with a smile of self-derision on
his face he drew his sword and lifted it to
the salute

  farewell noble farel apostle and sol-
dier par excdlence

  he galloped away

  hes crazy decided the lieutenant but

  if it will make him act like a man why
worry he added as an afterthought

i suppose i deserved that grandiloquent
leave taking country flag-what an ass
im getting to be 

  he picked up the field glasses abandoned
by champdor and watched the group com-
posed of makam tiaba sparbes and
champdor joined soon by mourdia and a
bonduke who was evidently the successor
of the rider slain the previous afternoon

  sparbes was protesting violently makam
tiaba wiped his face with the back of his
hand mourdia and the bonduke left going
to their respective contingents soon four
bulky objects were brought forward each
carried by more than one man when
these were deposited on the ground farel
recognized tomtoms war-tomtoms

  that big boy is teaching me something in
the handling of auxiliaries farel muttered

  champdor then harangued the men his
speech was translated by interpreters
farel looked for the tirailleurs a strange
sight met his eyes makam tiaba was un-
dressing he had discarded helmet and
coat stood with a chechia on his head his
torso bare tiaba removing his insignia
of rank was striving to regain his former
hold over his men

  the tomtoms rumbled sparbes was
coming back

  the defenders of besedougou suspecting
that the genuine effort was to come now
were silent

  what did you feed champdor sparbes
asked when he reached farels side hes
changed into a roaring lion

  whats he doing

  hes only talked-so far but if he does
one tenth of what he says hell do ahma-
dous pet town is thrice doomed the
auxiliaries are so excited hell have to hold
them back instead of urging them this is
what he said

   we brought you here because we be-
lieved you warriors you men of bondu
have you forgotten macadiacounda did
you fail the white men then you bamba-
ras the tukuleurs are your enemies they
stole your women burned your villages i
was told that if i made a hole with the can-
non you would go through there are the
holes and you are here if i had known
that you resembled women and captives
more than you did warriors i would have
brought fifty more tirailleurs to take the


adventure

place of your three thousand i myself
will take you forward now to see what you
are worth 

  not badly put farel was jubilant
with a chap like champdor its all or noth-
ing hes a play-actor a born tragedian
its just dawned on me he wouldnt muff
a scene like this

  if allah wills sparbes said piously
while the interpreters were translating
his speech he winked at me and sang
what

         du salut de notre patrie
         depend celui de iunivers

          si jamais elle est asservie

          tous les peuples sont dans les fers

         on the salvation of our country
         hangs that of the universe

          if ever it is made a slave

         all peoples will be shackled

  thats irony for you commented
farel in keeping with our often re-
peated statement that altruism guides our
conquering armies

  preserving a sense of humor at this
time is a stunt in will power i couldnt do
it and here ive been despising that poor
champdor

  three blasts from the captains whistle
interrupted them

  curtain call farel decided

  the tomtoms were pounding away sav-
agely for some minutes now the auxilia
ries had been swaying as if drunk on the
sound the tirailleurs had formed in line
makam tiaba was at his post

  champdor superb in attitude rode his
horse to the front held his sword high

  satan take me breathed sparbes
what a man

  champdor went forward at a moderate
trot behind him raced the tirailleurs
bayonets low and not ten yards away the
horde of auxiliaries

  the walls of basedougou were dotted
with puffs of smoke the first cover was
attained disregarded men were falling
but the ranks merely split and reformed
more than once champdor turned in the
saddle called to the men behind him
pointed at the opening with his sword

  in an unbelievably short time the dis-
tance between the original line and the walls
was covered in another ten seconds the
attackers would reach the breach

  a terrific discharge held in reserve by

diakates men tore through tirailleurs and
auxiliaries the line floated seemed to be
torn to rags champdors helmet was
blown from his head his blond hair
emerged from the confusion

  the captain detached himself from the
swirling mass and crossed the open space at
a mad gallop instead of approaching the
breach where he would have surely fallen
under the bullets he made for the wall at a
point not more than twelve feet high farel
and sparbes saw him stand on the saddle
reach both hands for the crest of the mud
barrier the right still holding the sword

  in another second champdor stood in
full view outlined against the green of the
trees and the buff of the huts bareheaded
and beckoning his followers forward

  the blue coats of the tirailleurs mingled
with the colorful swarm of the tukuleurs
then the mass of the auxiliaries closed the
breach poured into the town

  for a few seconds the captain remained
on the wall then he was seen to walk
toward the breach and disappear

  hes done it farel breathed

  the act was a success sparbes added
say farel i hope he comes back i-

i-

  so do i farel finished

when diakate had been given
charge of besedougou to hold
against the french he had said
if besedougou is taken never
more will men see me

  and besedougou would soon be taken
diakate at the breach had seen the ap-
proach of the tirailleurs had witnessed his
men helpless to check the advance

  yesterday far-eli once well known in
the region and long disappeared had sud-
denly loomed before the walls at the head of
the bambaras and bondukes the silver
bullet had dropped him and with his fall
the onslaught had lost its strength with
far-eli gone diakate had feared nothing of
other white men for if far-eli had failed
who could hope to succeed

  and then a strange face had materialized
a tall warrior with hair the color of gold
riding as no negro could ride bearing down
sword in hand untouched by the bullets
aimed at his chest the white man had
climbed the wall pointing the road to his
followers this warrior--he was even bet-
ter than far-eli had been
the figurehead



  the tukuleur chief shook his head to
clear his eyes obscured by the blood flowing
from a cut across his brow the white
wool on skull and chin alone revealed his
advanced age the muscles played with
undiminished vigor beneath the wrinkled
skin of his naked forearms emerging from
the folds of the embroidered boubou there
was still a chance to win out if the white
man were killed diakate had seen him
fall had seen blood on his clothing that
had been soon after the storming of the
gap in the wall when the frenchman had
leaped down into the thick of the fighting
diakate hoped that he was dead

  he retreated step by step before the
threatening bayonets through the narrow
gorge-like streets toward the diomfoutou
his men were fighting well even the
women took part in the struggle many
of them had come to the front crouching
and hacked at the legs of the tirailleurs
with knives one by one they were killed
diakate saw a big half-naked soldier with
a blade sunk in his thigh seize a woman by
the neck draw her erect and plunge his
bayonet between the breasts

  the bambaras and bondukes were every-
where diakate had fought them many
years before when serving el hadj omar
they had not been so brave then and
yesterday even their courage had not stood
the test what inspired them now if not
this new white man

  the open place before the diomfoutou was
reached the doors opened the tukuleurs
poured through while the attackers massed
down below hesitating as several of the
men sprang forward to drop the cross-bars
of the portals a minor chief addressed
diakate

  i saw the white man fall they will lose
heart

  diakate did not answer but led the way
through narrow corridors up dim stair-
ways to the chambers above where his
harem was gathered he glanced gloomily
at the frightened women kneeling hiding
their faces in terror truly too much ease
spoiled women the poor mens wives had
shown better behavior he spat upon the
floor and left to gain a loophole and in-
spect the situation

  the doors shook under the hammering
butts on several long poles tirailleurs
were attempting to gain the top of the first
wall diakate smiled widely-they had

believed their task over at the rampart and
found the most formidable barrier yet to

be passed

  he passed a long pistol through the loop-
hole pressed the trigger he knew that
he had ended another young life while he
still lived he who had been already a
strong man when el hadj omar had come
back from mekka he recalled the grand
salaam in dienne where he had first heard
the flaming words of the prophet he re-
called other days of battle he saw the
heaps of dead around medine the great
clamor of allah allah as twenty-five
thousand warriors pressed to the attack
certain that nothing could issue from the
white mens cannon save water flame
and steel had spurted that had been
war

  it would have been worthier perhaps had
he fallen with so many others in the full
faith in his cause now with the years
wisdom he felt that the days of black
mastery were gone forever frenchmen
could be killed but for each slain two more
appeared from the misty coast-line they
cast a spell over the negroes they came in
contact with a man who once took their
pay and learned to love their ways was gone
as a free warrior

  he lives some one cried out

  true the white man had arrived into the
central place he was upon his horse
yet he seemed strangely indifferent to the
fight chin on his chest he swayed with
the nervous shuffling of his mount his
coming was the signal for renewed efforts
to burst open the doors the panels shat-
tered diakate heard the trampling of
struggling men below

he straightened up discovered that his
pipe was empty and threw it to the floor

  he entered the room where the women
cooked a fire still burned in the center of
the floor the smoke escaping from a hole in
the roof he picked up a blazing stick and
walked on after passing many rooms he
came to a heavy door before which a young
man was on guard squatting rifle across
his knees

  go down to the floor below he ordered
thou art no longer needed here

  the warrior saw the torch in the firm
hand and his eyes grew wide he fled so
swiftly that he forgot his gun diakate
kicked it aside with a contemptuous grin
and pushed the door open


adventure

  he stepped into a spacious room half
filled with boxes and barrels on the floor
were small mounds of dark dust

  he waited until the triumphant shouts of
the white mens soldiers rang through the
halls until the wooden stairs creaked under
the feet of hurrying men

  i am very old he murmured and men
must die

  his master the great omar had perished
by a powder explosion he diakate by
the will of allah was to imitate the worthy
example

  men must die he repeated

  he threw the torch to the floor

mwith a terrific detonation a
column of flame shot up from the
diomfoutou

the troops left behind to
cover the french camp and the im-
provised gunpit milled in confusion
shouting half in delight at the tremen-
dous spectacle

  besans his face scarlet ran up to the two
other officers

  did you hear did you hear
couldnt very well help it farel com-
mented the diomfoutou has blown up
its over sparbes said and ran to his
horse im going to see

  besans divided between duty and curi-
osity at last returned to his guns

  farel summoned the four men assigned to
handle his stretcher and ordered them to
carry him into the town

  the dead and wounded from the three
attacks lay everywhere two-thirds of the
distance to the breach farel uttered an ex-
clamation of dismay mourdia face to the
sun sprawled arms and legs grotesquely
twisted his lips were wide apart and a
thin stream of blood coursed down the
black cheeks to the neck the silver
bullet had proved but a weak fetish
a tirailleur squatted behind a bush
fondled a broken hand a brown dog
roamed from one body to another sniff-
ing the fresh blood men struck in full
stride still appeared to be straining for-
ward green flies were already buzzing in
shimmering swarms

  human manure farel thought our
work to justify this the harvest must be
immense

  every instant he feared to see makam
tiabas corpse the cold rage of the

former non-com would have led him to risk
his life recklessly when makam tiaba
threw away his rank he revealed his real
worth the all powerful sense of duty the
stretcher bearers named some of the vic-
tims as they passed they evidenced no
sorrow rather a speculative philosophical
wonder that these others and not they had
gone

  see seydou mousa there-his head is
wide open

  kirena was hit in the belly he curves
bis back and has both hands across his
stomach

  he looks as if he had eaten too much
rice this morning

  one of the men turned to farel

  many die lieutenant by and by all
tirailleurs die

  not so farel replied soon there
will be no more fighting

  no more fighting what men do then

  work

  the black did not insist but it was plain
that he and his comrades did not relish
the prediction a world without war
and existence without the supreme mo-
ments of danger was beyond their under-
standing

  at the breach farel overtook sparbes
who dismounted walked through the
debris

  you can see where our men and the
tukuleurs came together he declared
the line of dead is as definite as the fringe
of a wave on sand if our humanitarians
saw this wed never get through listening to
their yells i notice they never shed tears
over those of us who go under

  fortunately theyre not in the habit
of frequenting battlefields theyll come
later talk of equality-and install them-
selves as administrators we kill they
rob

  heres champdor sparbes said with a
ring in his voice

  farel looked up

  down the narrow street makam tiaba
appeared leading a white horse by the
bridle on the horse was champdor he
did not look up at every stride of the
horse his torso swayed as the strange
procession drew nearer farel perceived that
the front of his uniform was soaked red
his hands hung limply a bright object
protruded behind his head

  he is badly hurt sparbes said
the figurehead



  beside the stretcher tiaba halted he
was bloody from head to foot his cheek
was torn open farel looked into champ-
dors face the features were calm the
eyes closed a thin stream of blood
streaked his chin dripping from the corner
of his lips as blood had seeped from mour-
dias lips

  dead farel said dazed

  dead agreed tiaba he was hit by
several bullets in the body when he leaped
into the breach from the wall i knew he
was dying i wanted to send him back
he said he would not go he called for his
horse i and some others pushed him into
the saddle and tied him as he said to do
knowing that he would soon die knowing
what he wished i ran his sword inside his
tunic to hold him up then he said lead
the horse tiaba i was afraid you would
blame me but he said again lead
the horse tiaba they want a white
man i am a white man i then under-
stood why he wished to go on and i
led him forward before the diomfou-
tou the auxiliaries had become afraid
when they saw him they thought he was

alive and fought-

 take him back makam tiaba

  the sub-lieutenant tugged at the bridle
he was a good white man he con-
cluded

  native instinct unerring touch-stone-
makam tiaba had long ago sensed the gold
in the base metal

again farel was in the kayes
hospital again the comman-
der in chief was at his bedside
w another like combeau the

same ruthlessness in action the same kind-
ness to a defeated enemy the french did
not shape the sudan the sudan shaped
frenchmen

  there was something between champ-
dor and yourself farel- then as farel
did not speak i will not ask you to say
anything against him but i may inform
you that captain champdor on his way
through kayes left the usual papers to be
sent to his relatives should he die one of
the envelopes was addressed to me you
probably know what it contained

  i think i do 

  you are young can easily make up for
lost time- the commander smiled-
with the assistance of a repentant staff i
have discreetly informed your comrades of
the truth as is but right your promotion
will be hastened thats about all

  farel did not immediately speak

  it seems a pity colonel he volunteered
at last that death should be needed to
place the seal of sincerity on remorse and
atonement its a hard code

  for us death should mean nothing
the manner of meeting death is the test
champdor stood it well his death served
france more than his life it is sad to pass
out of the picture but sooner or later men
must die

padder williams wander-
ing bronc peeler had hung his
rope on a close-coupled cayuse in

he had snubbed the horses head short to a
post and put on the saddle blanket the
horse had stamped on his foot fodder
whose temper was short had responded
with an oath that smoked and grabbed the

quirt that dangled from his wrist when-

  whack a hard old fist caught fodder
williams back of the ear it was a stinging
blow probably accompanied in fodders
head by a great flash of light and the sound
of distant thunder the cowboy took
three gigantic hasty steps such as any
man takes when caught off his balance and
sprawled in the spring mud he was up
instantly and whirled with ready fists

  now listen said whiskers beck
backing away with his hands above his
head wait a minute i didnt go fer to

  to be walloped behind the ear without
notice is a surprize to most but to whirl
with battle in your eye to find a white-
bearded attacker backing away with his
hands up and declaring that he didnt
mean nothin by it-that is astonishing
fodder paused with fist drawn back for
a shattering haymaker and his mouth
dropped open

  leave me explain urged whiskers
hold on now

  fodder recovered himself and started
forward

 why you-old-

  whiskers lowered his hands and ruefully
braced himself to meet the attack it
didnt come a restraining noose dropped
over fodders shoulders and jerked his el-
bows against his sides

  now here interposed whack-ear
bates approaching hand over hand along
the rope mebbe you think youre havin
a scrap with whiskers but sech aint the
case anyways not till im topped off
smatter with you

  fodder williams was a man extremely
willing with his fists but he was only a
medium-sized man and whack-ears lean
two hundred pounds towered over him like
a coyote over a prairie dog fodder con-
sidered afmoment as he shook loose the
relaxed rope and his wrath cooled some-
what

  this bush-faced pelican went to work
an pasted me with a rock he declared

  i done no sech thing protested whisk-
ers i jest kinda patted him with the flat
o my hand to tract his attention

 why you - began fodder again

showing signs of action

  at this point old ben rutherford the
old man stepped into the conference

  whup pull up he put in mostly
my boys takes care o thmselves but
whiskers is only about a hundred years old
an a likely lad and i dont want him all
busted in pieces you leave him be

adventure

 fodder slammed his five-pound hat
 against the ground

 you standin there an tellin me i got

 to let every -in the outfit knock me

 down all he wants to

 leave me explain said whiskers
 didnt mean to cause no bother but
 that bronc theres jest exactly the hoss i
 been lookin fer fer a sartin particlar use
 it took moren three years tuh make that
 hoss an i dont perpose to have him
 spoiled by bein hit with no quirt so
 when fodder hauls off at him i had to take
 action sudden

 lemme get this straight said the old
 man shoving his broad hat to the back of
 his head you wallops this feller

 yep

 to stop him hittin the hoss

 yep

 three mouths dropped open as the men
 stared at whiskers a blank expression
 erased all signs of intelligence from the old
 mans craggy face he and whack-ear
 looked at each other dumbfounded

 well said old man rutherford finally
 its a plumb mystery to me but wil-
 liams youll have to leave whiskers be
 thats flat either you calls off this deal or
 you kin move on

 fodder computed hastily he knew that
 if he quit the outfit the story would go out
 that he had been whipped and driven off
 by a man old enough to be his great-grand-
 father such a story would never do for
 his future reputation on the range he
 stalled for time

 look at them chaps he demanded

 he pointed to the dirt that smeared the
 silky unclipped goat hair adorning his bowed
 legs

 jest look

 leave me have that cayuse an ill clean
 them chaps up fine offered whiskers

 how bout the hat pursued fodder
 picking the article up from where he had
 thrown it himself

 all right-hat too conceded whiskers

 take it or leave it lie said old man
 rutherford

 ill call quits fodder decided

 whiskers heaved a sigh of relief

 come on hoss les you an me go
 somewheres where its quiet

 the three stared after him without com-
 prehension as he led the dancing cayuse
 away

how yuh cornin with the spe-
cially eddicated bronc whisk-

 ers

  four days had gone by since
whiskers had knocked fodder sprawling
and whack-ear thought the subject should
now be cool enough for mess-shack handling

  fair whiskers reported kettled
somethin terrble yestidday didnt know
but what id bit off moren i should me
bein stiffer than once that parts finished
though wont do no more than crow-hop
to get warm from now on i figger

   i wouldnt give two cents for a horse that
bucked only jest the once said dixie
kane not one cent even gimme a
horse with sperrit that fights back plenty
thisns different said whiskers
through a mouthful of hot potatoes

   get a real sperrited horse said dixie
kane then get on an ride-thats my
way

  whiskers gestured with his fork gulped
and unlimbered into speech

  so i notice he replied an you never
made a top hoss neither some o you
rannies think if you can climb on an stay
on the top side that you know the whole
works nossir trouble with you yer
ridin hasnt been backed up by no readin
readin repeated doughfoot wil-
son startled into unaccustomed speech

what the-

  squirty wallace snickered and choked
  whiskers went on unperturbed

  betcha yuh never even heard about
terlegaphy he declared

  sure i did dixie kane contended
hotly you sends somethin through a
wire an it comes out the other end in the
shape o rattles an clicks

  this here i got hold of is a new kind
said whiskers i got it out of a news-
paper you sends a message from one
brain to another without wires nor nothin
jest by concentratin the human eye
hosses catches on special easy bein they
use it theirself all the time

   now this here little hoss ten spot hes
jest the hoss for that im goin to fix him
so i kin operate him by terlegaphy not hol-
lerin at him nor nothin trouble with
most cayuses is theyre hard in the head
peetrified yuh might say ten spots dif-
ferent what i think goes from my eye to
his temperment like a magnet an there
takes effect ten spot hes the right kind-
terlegaphy and the bronc

i

hard in the muscle but not in the head
kind o soft in the bean huh said
whack-ear well theres others
mebbe said whiskers wiping his
brush-like beard with his sleeve wait a
while an well see

   he got up and strolled out fumbling for
 his makings just around the corner of the
 mess shack he brought them to light and
 paused to roll a cigaret he could hear the
 voices within

   hes goin to work an spoilin a good
 fast horse said dixie kane when a
 horse dont fight back right why some-
 thins wrong either in horse or handlin
 he makes me sick said fodders voice
 if now jest fr instance somebody would
 take an sling their hat down in front o that
 bronc jest as he was ridin him out-i
  wonder now if what follered wouldnt set
 em both into righter ways o thinkin
 yep said whack-ear ony any-
 body wont or hadnt better

well theres a whole - of a lot of

 wonts around this outfit answered fod-
 der thats all i got to say

   whiskers walked to the bunk house and
got his old six-shooter out of his bed roll
and when fodder came up whiskers was
sitting on a bench outside cleaning the gun
with care

  whats all that for fodder asked
casually

   whiskers looked at him with a slow bale-
 ful gaze

   well he said if everythin goes jest to
 suit me im goin to shoot a yalla praira
 dog someday

   he got up stuck the iron in its open
holster hooked the slit thong over the ham-
mer and strolled off toward the corrals
fodder stared after him

   crazy loco he told himself an lible
 to go hurtin somebody like as not some-
 thin oughter be done bout that he
 scratched his head mebbe too im the
 one that oughter do it come a chance

whiskers began ten spots
education when the first green
grass was showing at the edge of
the melting snow for four weeks
fodder williams dixie kane and charley
decatur worked in the breaking corral
peeling the raw broncs that had been hazed
in with the range stock the winter riders
together with half-a-dozen punchers who

 had wintered in town and several new hands
 amused themselves topping off the strings of
 saddle stock that were cut to them and
 whiskers worked chiefly on ten spot

  by the time that the wagons pulled out
for the spring round-up whiskers was more
confident than ever that ten spot was the
makins of probably the best-and certainly
the most terlegaphic-cow horse in three
remudas

  from time to time whiskers would dem-
onstrate to skeptics how terlegaphy worked
in practise he would walk out to the edge
of the remuda and pick a point possibly
fifty yards from ten spot then without
saying a word he would fold his arms and
subject ten spot to a piercing glare the
ragging of the other punchers was some-
what diminished by the fact that ten spot
actually came doughfoot wilson at least
was sufficiently impressed to try it himself
but as nothing happened he gave it up and
returned to talkin down a rope

  most however thought they perceived a
connection between whiskers terlegaphy
and ten spots taste for fresh bread and
said so nevertheless the most unim-
pressed were willing to admit that whiskers
tutelage was developing ten spot into a
willing and brainy little cow horse 

  spring breezed past and the early
round-up was over riders rode out singly
or in little groups of twos and threes to
hunt out the scattered wild cattle that the
round-up had missed with a view to deco-
rating calf hides with brands these were
often gone many weeks at a time living off
the country when their scant rations were ex-
hausted and so the summerran its course

  then as the first frosts began to turn the
prairie wool the color of dusty leather the
cook once more yelled at his six-horse team
and the chuck wagon rolled charley de-
catur the pilot rode in the lead vand the
bed wagon and the wood wagon swung in
behind following these came the remuda-
the herd of saddle stock and sixteen or
seventeen punchers rode where they pleased
the fall works were on

  ten spot was now rounding into a mighty
neat little cow horse one that showed an
intelligent interest in his work whiskers
was working harder than ever to make ten
spot strictly telegraphic and seemed to be
having some success

  the test of whiskers terlegaphy theory
came in the fall round-ups third week


adventure

whiskers had in mind several
fine points in the education of ten
spot which he conceived could
be best taught out of sight and
sound of the herd he wanted to teach him
for instance the uncommon knack of driving
two or three steers in a constant direction
without frequent correction by his rider
he wanted him to know the vagaries of a
lone steer on the open plain as differing
from those of a steer near a herd and other
points leading to the consummation of his
ideal

  whack-ear said whiskers to the straw
boss reckon if id ride back northard a
ways i might pick up quite a little bunch o
stray critters

  take a look said whack-ear

  whiskers beck therefore tied three days
very scant rations and a couple of blankets
to his saddle and without further ado rode
north

  he swung in a wide circle so planning
that when his chuck gave out he would be
not more than nine hours easy ride from the
main herd hunting was for some reason
not so good as he had expected on the
morning of the fourth day he was not more
than four hours jog from the herd driving
only two hobbled steers a little after mid-
day he jumped a third steer

  the animal evidently a wise old-timer
had been lying low in a bunch of brush and
ten spot was almost upon the steer before
it broke the horse leaped in pursuit over-
taking the steer in easy bounds whiskers
tossed his rope over the long horns and
jerked it taut ten spot was fast catching
on to this part of the job the buckskin
pony swung round the hind quarters of the
steer to the far side and raced ahead the
steer his hind legs jerked from under
him crashed to the ground in a cloud of
dust

  ten spot stopped and leaned on the rope
whiskers was already off running to the
steer quickly the old puncher hog-tied
one foreleg to the two hind feet then he
calmly sat on the steers carcass and rolled a
cigaret

  real good ten spot make a hoss yet
ifn you keep tryin

  leisurely he smoked the cigaret and
rested watching with pleasure the patience
with which ten spot stood to the rope
presently he tossed away the fag loosed the
lariat coiled it and hung it on the saddle

next he tied the steers off hind foot to its
near fore with a short piece of rope

  whiskers remembered afterward that he
had looked at that bit of rope with sus-
picion it was pretty old cut from a worn-
out lariat but

  ifn it busts we got more said whiskers

  now he passed the steers tail between its
hind legs took a firm grip with one hand
and with the other loosed the piggin
string

  twelve hundred pounds of beef struggled
to rise whiskers hung on to the tail pull-
ing upward and the steer stayed down in
few moments the big black beast gave it up

  now cmere said whiskers to ten
spot still dimly trying to please ten spot
came three steps closer

  little more demanded whiskers ten
spot advanced one step

  more yet

  ten spot lowered his head and whuffed
at the steer with an air of distrust then ad-
vanced a very scant foot

  oh all right said whiskers guess
the old man can make it from here

  whiskers suddenly released the steers
tail and bolted for his saddle he saw ten
spot shuffle nervously and knew the big
black critter was surging to its feet in
that instant a dog hole caved under whis-
kers foot and he plunged headlong almost
against his horses cannon-bone ten
spot shied in a sidelong leap that took him
yards beyond whiskers reach the old
man heard the snap of -the breaking hobble
and a furious thud of hoofs

  instantly whiskers snatched his iron from
its open holster cocked the pistol with the
same motion that flicked the slit thong off
the hammer rolled over on his elbow threw
up the barrel-all in less than a second-
pulled the trigger

  a dull click responded then a second as
he pulled again flying hoofs red eyes
a tremendous sweep of horns were almost
upon him whiskers rolled like a flash
toward the charging beast horns and
hoofs passed over

  the man twisted head and shoulders and
with elbow resting on the ground pulled the
trigger four times as the steer whirled and
returned to the charge not one shot an-
swered a terrible sickening sensation
gripped the old mans vitals the sensation
of a weaponless man facing imminent death

 as the hammer clicked harmlessly upon
terlegaphy and the bronc



the last chamber whiskers threw out the
cylinder and snapped the ejector six
empty shells fell into the dust his left
hand shot to a chap pocket once more
that great horned head flashed above him
he rolled toward the trampling hoofs the
fore hoofs passed over one sharp iron-
hard hind hoof spurned his left knee with a
vicious grind

  in a deep corner of the pocket whiskers
fingers found a cartridge with hand
shaking a little with haste he popped the
cartridge into the chamber snapped the
cylinder into place the steer was charg-
ing again this time the gun spoke
with a heavy crash and the steer went
down

  well gosliamighty said whiskers

peevishly its pretty-near time

  he sat up and examined his numbed knee
ill-humoredly the pain was just begin-
ing to course into it with the throbbing
return of the blood a warm trickle along
his thigh told him that the knee was be-
ginning to bleed he decided to take off
his weather-stiffened chap and see if a band-
age would help with his hands he ginger-
ly bent the leg

 wowie hold on cowboy he ad-
dressed himself we jest better let well
enough be me im goin home

  he tried to get to his feet it was no
use it simply couldnt be done now if
ever was the time to send a few urgent
mental messages to his horse he rested
painfully on his elbow and concentrated
mind and eye on ten spot

  ten spot had discreetly retired from the
scene of action and was now grazing a
hundred yards away whiskers fixed him
with a sincere glare and sent him a mental
telegram that fairly shot sparks nothing
happened perhaps after all terlegaphy
was unable to carry over so great distances
when several minutes of this brought no
more favorable results whiskers tried
other resources	

  he whistled sharply to attract the ponys
attention ten spot looked up and favored
whiskers with a long deliberate stare
then he returned to his grass

  hey there shouted whiskers you
know what i mean come over here
mind now

no sign of intelligence from ten spot
the old man began to swear a thin
stream of scorching invective trailed across

the prairie to ten spot the horse grazed
steadily unimpressed

  whiskers changed his tactics

  beans ten spot he called persuasive-
ly openin up a nice juicy can o beans
come an get em dont you want beans

  ten spot gave no sign that he had heard
possibly he preferred tangible grass to
imaginary canned goods in any case he
stayed where he was

  terlegaphy and the human voice alike
failed to dent ten spots brazen indiffer-
ence he had evidently discovered that he
didnt have to obey

  when a horse wont come to you it is
necessary to go to the horse whiskers in-
jured knee was now paining him badly
his left foot was beginning to swell and
with great difficulty he worked off the loose
boot with the toe of the other then
dragging the boot in one hand he began to
crawl toward the horse

 slowly painfully he pulled
iilwbs himself across the level ground

          the sock dragged off of the boot-
less foot a little trickle of blood
appeared on the ankle and began to dot his
trail with little dark spots every inch of
the way was torture but inch by inch foot
by foot he somehow covered the ground
from time to time ten spot moved for-
ward in his grazing undoing in a moment
five minutes of agonizing toil

  whiskers knew that the nearer he ap-
proached ten spot without attracting the
animals attention the surer was his chance
of success he paused and rested ten
yards from the mount then forced himself
to go on five yards ten spot was headed
the other way just a little farther he told
himself two yards more

  cmere ten spot

  his voice sounded strange a hoarse
raucous croak

  ten spot started spun about and gazed
at the grotesque sprawling figure of the
man perhaps a faint scent of blood came
to his nostrils he whuffed shook his
head and started away at a lope one
forefoot stepped on the trailing reins jerk-
ing down his head and the horse somer-
saulted badly scared the pony scrambled
to his feet and went into a mad fit of buck-
ing as he plunged away then he straight-
ened out and ran

  ten spot was half a mile away when he


adventure

began to graze again whiskers face be-
came gray and set as he stared at the distant
horse without even an oath the old man
gritted his teeth and started the long drag
in pursuit

  the pain in his leg was now almost un-
bearable running in hot surges well up into
his back the blood still trickled slowly
draining his strength it left little blacken-
ing dots in the dust of the plain once he
collapsed face down his laboring breath
drawing little particles of sand between his
dry lips and when he tried to spit it out he
could not

  yet he went on and on ever so slowly
covering the ground while the hours passed
and the sun went down and finally some-
how three-quarters of a mile from the car-
cass of the steer he found himself once more
one hundred yards from his horse whisk-
ers regarded with dull eyes the animal that
meant life hope the only chance he had to
avoid a slow death on the plain

  the bleeding had stopped at last but he
was weak he had not eaten since sun-up
and this with the loss of blood left him
faint his head pounded and swam and
gradually the prairie floor assumed a slow
hardly perceptible revolving motion that
told him he had not much farther to go

  the sun was setting now behind the far
wind river mountains spreading over the
softening sky a glory of wine purple and
aztec gold that whiskers did not see
and with the sunset there came a far-off
sound that brought the cold sweat to the
old mans brow

  it began in a low moaning thunder the
deep-lunged bass of a restless bull it in-
creased in volume till the great voice broke
into bleating soprano bellows no per-
sonality in the herd is so subject to malevo-
lent whim as the bull he can be as docile
and timorous as any calf or sometimes he
can work himself up to prowl and stamp
half the night with enraged roars over half
a tin-cupful of spilled blood

  not a fearsome sound this bellowing to
a man in the saddle or by a fire but an
ominous thing to a crippled man alone on
the plain lying at the end of a dotted trail
of blood slowly whiskers twisted his
head and looked back the way he had come
he could see the cattle perhaps a dozen of
them a low black blur three-quarters of a
mile away the bull he could not make
out but whiskers knew that he was prob-

ably sniffing the blood of the fallen steer and
throwing dirt over his own back with
pawing hoof

  whiskers thrust a shaking hand into the
pocket that had yielded the stray car-
tridge in the desperate hope that another
might be there the pocket contained to-
bacco crumbs lint-nothing more hastily
the old man began searching the other
pockets in his clothes

  good - he whispered fervently

leave me have jest one for-s sake be

there be there

  one was shakily whiskers put the lone
remaining cartridge into his gun then
with clamped teeth and features contorted
with pain he began the traversing of that
last hundred yards to ten spot slowly
very slowly he made his way pausing fre-
quently to husband strength it was like
the nightmare torture of a fever dream
nearer now sounded the deep moaning
voice of the bull mwaaaw-mmm-
waaaaw a malevolent evil thing

  twenty minutes passed the clear light
of evening was dimming into dusk whisk-
ers looked back he could make out the bull
now a great dark beast in advance of his
little band of staring cattle he could see
him sniff and paw unquestionably he was
following up that crooked tortured trail
the man turned his eyes to ten spot
thirty yards away

  the horse had ceased to graze and was
half turned staring back perhaps he was
suspiciously regarding the huddled figure
on the ground perhaps looking at the ap-
proaching cattle beyond on what the
animal would do next depended whiskers
chance for fife

  the old man gaged the distance little
use the single cartridge to kill the bull if
the other cattle followed in a trampling
rush or if ten spot once more cantered be-
yond his reach into the dusk whiskers
made a brave decision drawing his re-
volver he staked his life on a single flip of
the cards

  he braced his elbows and aimed with
both hands at the top of ten spots neck
a graze shot could drop the horse momen-
tarily stunned a fraction of an inch too
high would miss an equal margin too low
would kill either error would mean the
end

  his hands shook and he dared not shoot
three times he closed his eyes and lowered
terlegaphy and the bronc



the gun to steady his trembling hands on
the fourth attempt he fired and ten spot
fell

  scrambling regardless now of pain
whiskers clawed himself over the ground
any old way desperately striving to reach
the pny before he should rise if indeed
he were ever to rise again he reached the
fallen horse dragged himself over ten spots
barrel and clutched the horn a long mo-
ment passed the horse motionless beneath
him not seeming to breathe

  mwaaaaw-mmmwaaawl said the voice
of the bull very close now so close that
when he stood and pawed whiskers could
hear his hoof tear at the earth the old
man rested he was through his last card
played it was already decided whether he
had lost-or won

  ten spot stirred then rolled over on to
his knees and shook his head with a
mighty effort whiskers got his sound leg
over the saddle the pony heaved to his
feet

  its me ten spot whiskers croaked
its me whoa an easy in the name o

-

  somehow whiskers recovered the trailing
reins and held the pony to a jogging walk
until he could fumblingly strap himself to
the saddle by buckling front and rear coat-
straps through his belt his released bed
roll slid off but he didnt care he let the
reins fall over the pommel and held on with
both hands with the battle over his game
old nerve gave out and the tears ran into
his beard

  ten spot skirted the little herd of cattle
and headed south for the remuda far away

  seems like-were goin-the wrong
way said whiskers through the mists of
pain

  he vainly tried to turn ten spot with his
sound leg ten spot went on

dawn and a creeping grayness
then two long streaks of burnt
orange came into the buckwheat
sky just above the eastern hori-
zon like long trailers of bright smoke

  at the main herd camp of the triangle-r
one of the motionless rolls of blanket
emitted a preliminary whimper growled
and disgorged a tousled and bleary-eyed
cook fully dressed this abused-looking
husky stumbled over to the next roll of
blanket and nudged it with his boot

  huh he said to it in a tone of com-
mand snother day

  a puff-eyed puncher struggled to a sit-
ting position and shook the next man

  with sleepy but effective movements the
cook was starting his fire the two wakened
punchers pulled on their boots picked
up rope and rig and stumbled off toward
the remuda preparing to relieve the two
motionless statues riding night herd a quar-
ter of a mile away an encouraging smell
of bitter black coffee began to drift over the
camp a great mass of potatoes began to
sizzle the fire cracked and smoked blanket
rolls stirred and subsided the men inside
groping for a last brief cat-nap before the
ordeal of getting into action

  whack-ear deep within his blankets
woke slowly and painfully considered the
necessity of rolling out some feeble fum-
bling cleared his head of the blankets he
yawned-and then listened the soft
plunk of walking hoofs sounded close very
close in another moment a hoof moved
into his range of vision and stopped
whack-ear twisted his neck and with
sleepy stupidity made his eye trace up a
foreleg to the horse at the end of it sud-
denly whack-ear burst out of his blankets
with a great yell

  for-s sake look here

  all around him heads thrust sleepily out
of blanket rolls they stared for a fraction
of a moment then their owners like whack-
ear turned out with sudden alacrity a
cluster of serious-faced punchers quickly
formed about the invading horse

  in the saddle sat whiskers slumped over
the pommel gripping the horn with white
stiff hands one leg crooked and un-
natural stuck out stiffly away from the
stirrup he looked at them uncompre-
hendingly with haggard staring eyes that
seemed set in black pits

  whack-ear and squirty wallace were
fumbling at the straps that tied the old
puncher to the saddle whiskers opened
his mouth and tried to speak but only a
rasping noise came forth then with a
great effort he wrenched out a question

  which o you boys he croaked took
the cartridges-out o-my iron

  no one answered whiskers slowly
moved his haggard blank eyes over the
group of punchers

  i know he rasped fixing his gaze upon
fodder williams thats the one


adventure

 he let go the horn and stretched a stiff
 shaking claw in fodders direction

 you - yalla - coyote - ill fix - your

whiskers gripped the pommel and gamely
tried to swing himself out of the saddle
then suddenly he collapsed into whack-
ears arms

if i was you fodder said whack-ear
presently i blieve id take my horse an

ter from all angles took his horse and

a mystery man

 by eugene cunningham

ioneer californians like to rem-
inisce about the cosmopolitan
citizenry of san francisco in gold
rush times there were so many
men of various nations and walks of life
that queer characters were myriad one
must have been markedly different to
attract attention in that heterogeneous
gathering

  in  a man named william f hamilton
was daily pointed out on the streets for his
singular refinement of appearance and man-
ner even in that day of long beards red
shirts and muddy boots hamilton managed
to be amazingly dapper little was known
of him save that he was born in jamaica
and came to california from new york

  he remained in the city no man knowing
exactly what his occupation was as san
francisco assumed the airs of older places
and uncouthness waned hamilton put on
a suit of the finest broadcloth of unim-
peachable style and cut snowy linen and a
high silk hat shinier than any other seen
on montgomery street

  it was his custom to promenade with
dignity along montgomery every pleasant
afternoon bowing formally to acquain-
tances always attracting much attention
because he seemed to type the perfect
chesterfield he was a member of the
society of california pioneers many had
seen him daily since  still his manner of
living was a mystery

  the passing years seemed to touch all
but hamilton men knew that he must be
growing very old but he was an institu-

tion seeming little more changeable than
stone but upon a sunny afternoon in
 he did not appear at his usual hour
the next day he was missing still and the
next then the papers printed brief no-
tices of his death some one more than
ordinarily curious had traced the usual
course of the old elegant and finally reached
the building from which he set out daily

  he lived in a warehouse loft near the
juncture of california and davis streets
here he had lodged and worked for years
stuffing mattresses pew and carriage cush-
ions and the like each afternoon he had
sallied out to comport himself as he felt a
gentleman should

  those who entered the bleak loft lit-
tered with the material and tools of his
trade fancied almost that they looked upon
a stranger so hollow-cheeked so aged the
meager figure on the pallet its newly dyed
black beard seeming artificial as stage
make-up an ingenious contrivance held
the old mans coat and trousers in shape
his shining hat was in its box a black wig
carefully combed was on its block his
boots were treed and set with heels together
in their corner

  all his life centered in those promenades
among the fashionables he was willing
it seemed to labor in this gloomy loft if it
gave him means to play the gentleman-
and a thorough gentleman he was by all
reports-for a little while each day he
was dead and with him died his secret if
there were really any secret beyond a
strong set independent character

ground till he reached a clump of service-
berry bushes pushing his way into the
protective shadows he stood erect and
canting his head toward the quarter from
which the attack had come listened long
and attentively but he heard nothing
save the sounds common to the night in the
mountains a hundred miles removed from
every vestige of civilization

  presently he sat down back against the
bole of a tree still alert and watchful two
hours dragged by and at the end of that
time concluding that his assailants had
withdrawn he unrolled his blankets and
was soon asleep

  the big indian was a fit product of his
time he had been chief of the tillayuma
indian police for ten years and in that time
had won a unique position for himself both
in the estimation of the law abiding and the
lawless uncorruptible and just reputed

the strongest and quickest man on the
reservation a peerless shot with either rifle
or pistol combining dauntless courage with
the cunning and wariness of a fox yet his
big chest housed the simple heart of an un-
spoiled child and he had besides an un-
failing sense of humor that had stood him
in good stead in many a crisis in his exciting
career

  three days before he had left the flat
dog agency to investigate a reported kill-
ing of elk by a band of indians on their
summer hunt and this night found him far
back in the blue mountains and as he had
supposed many miles from any human be-
ing yet out of the solitude had come the
sudden attack which but for a lucky move
on his part would have been fatal

  with the first gray tinge of dawn eunam-
tuck awoke determining to investigate
the mysterious assault of the night before
he slipped out of his blankets and picking
up his rifle set out

  choosing a circuitous route he warily ap-
proached the point from which the shots had
been fired in time he came upon it a
big pine lay across the trail and behind it he
found the prints left in the soft mold where
the two assailants had knelt down to sight
their rifles over the log barricade his
camp was a good two hundred yards away
and the accuracy with which the shots had
been fired in the uncertain light easily dem-
onstrated that he was not dealing with nov-
ices in the use of firearms close behind
the logs he picked up two empty shells


adventure

which he proceeded to examine with care
the first was one used in a high-power
modern hunting rifle of well-known make
while the second was an old-fashioned win-
chester shell

  the log lay squarely across the trail
which sloped away quite sharply in the
direction opposite from his camp the two
men had come and gone down this trail
their tracks being easily discernible in the
thin layer of dust as eunamtuck cau-
tiously followed their back trail he studied
the parallel tracks with care from the
exaggerated pigeon-toed style of one of the
men eunamtuck concluded that he was an
indian the tracks of the other however
puzzled eunamtuck for a time unless
the man was faking he was crippled in the
left foot so much so that only the heel
touched the ground as eunamtuck fol-
lowed these irregular tracks his brows knit-
ted in thought he told himself that some-
where he had seen them before and then in a
flash it came to him he paused abruptly

   hip huddle he grunted doubt-
less he continued in the nez perces tongue
the other is takamsin

  hip huddle had been so named from his
peculiar jerky style of walking or as old
bat jennison quaintly phrased it-

  he just naturally shoulders his hip every
step he takes

  he was one of those disreputable whites
often found around an indian reservation
who make a precarious living through devi-
ous and unlawful ways from the milder
forms of iniquity such as smuggling bad
whisky on to the reservation and defraud-
ing the unsophisticated indian wards in a
half-dozen different ways he had by de-
grees graduated into a career of deeper
crime darkened by deeds of violence and
bloodshed

  with him had been associated a tillayu-
ma indian takamsin a fit companion in
his lawless deeds

  six years before the two men had sud-
denly disappeared from the reservation
but from time to time news had trickled
back from the flat head reservation in
montana which indicated that they had
merely shifted their field of operations but
if eunamtucks inference was correct the
two had returned and that return had
been signalized by his attempted murder

  fully aware of the desperate character of
the two men eunamtuck redoubled his

caution for he had no mind to run head-on
into an ambuscade as it proved in the
end his caution at this time was so much
wasted effort for presently he came upon
their nights camp

  the dead ashes of their fire were ample
proof that it had been out for hours and
eunamtuck concluded that they had in all
probability abandoned it soon after their
unsuccessful attempt to kill him every-
thing indicated that the camp had been
deserted in a panic for he found two or
three small articles which had escaped them
in their haste only one thing interested
him however a badly crumpled twenty-
dollar bill

  painstakingly eunamtuck smoothed it
out he could read after a fashion and he
finally made out that it was a note on the
first national bank of tekoa a town lying
just beyond the limits of the tillayuma
reservation some four miles distant from
the agency at flat dog now eunam-
tucks sense of smell was as keen as a
hounds and applying the bank note to his
big hooked nose he sniffed at it a moment
then threw up his head with a chuckle

  injun he declared

for him the identity of the pair
was now settled beyond a shadow
of doubt he was dealing again
with hip huddle and takamsin
pausing only long enough to make sure of
the direction of their flight he returned to
his own camp ate breakfast and saddling
his horse set out in pursuit of the two out-
laws he knew that they had a lead of
several hours for he reasoned that they had
in all likelihood slipped away as soon as the
moon had come up probably about twelve
oclock

  the trail paralleled in rough fashion the
south bank of the tillayuma river and now
giving the pinto his head the indian divided
his attention equally between watching the
tracks left by the two horses and keeping a
sharp lookout ahead for the outlaws when
the signs indicated that the two had pushed
their horses into a gallop he did the same
but never for a moment did he relax his
vigilance	i

  he was thoroughly versed in the art of
reading signs and could tell with approxi-
mate certainty the age of a trail conning
these things over as he rode hunched
over his saddle eyes glued to the trail he
the pursuit



concluded that they were three or four
hours in the lead at the least

  they seemed to hold the lead all through
the afternoon and well toward evening
and then something happened that gave
him cause to reflect

  the trail at this particular point ran up
quite sharply over a tongue of rubble that
had washed down through a little gully to
the very bank of the river the obstruc-
tion was not high twenty feet possibly but
the ascent was so sharp that it would be
impossible to see a dozen feet of the trail
ahead once he was on the ascent

  eunamtuck brought his pony to a halt
and considered the situation the one
thing that threatened the greatest danger to
him was to run head-on into an ambuscade
and this spot certainly afforded a perfect
setting for such an enterprise on the part of
the outlaws

  mentally exchanging places with the two
eunamtuck reasoned that they were per-
fectly certain that he would pursue them
with this established it was only a step to
the conclusion that they would try to elude
him or failing in that would undertake to
kill him what more natural for them than
to lead him to think they were miles away
when in fact they were lying by the trail
watching patiently for him to ride into a
trap

  eunamtuck the wiliest of men decided
to investigate first riding back a few
yards he turned his pony aside behind a
clump of alder and dismounting returned
rifle in hand toward the point that had at-
tracted his attention as he approached
the foot of the slide his sharp eyes glimpsed
something that certainly justified his cau-
tion

  a big rattler was leisurely drawing his
stubby body across the highest point in the
trail when suddenly he stopped and throw-
ing himself into a great coil began to send
out his blood-chilling warning and the
malevolent lidless eyes of the snake were
fixed on some object on the other reach of
the trail and invisible to the indian

  without for a moment shifting his gaze
from the animated danger signal perched
on the arch of the trail eunamtuck backed
stealthily behind a great fir tree rifle out-
thrust and ready for instant use how long
the big rattler continued to send out his
challenge eunamtuck did not know but
presently the whirring gradually ceased

slowly the huge coils relaxed and the snake
crawled on across the trail and disappeared
in the underbrush

  cautiously eunamtuck negotiated the
sharp ascent crossed the divide and within
a dozen yards was in full possession of the
secret of the rattlers warning behind a
rock at the side of the trail the thick grass
had been crushed flat and so recently
too that even while he examined the spot
the blades were straightening up in jerky
fashion showing that the place had been
deserted within the last few minutes at the
longest

  for a moment he wondered that he had
heard not a sound as the two men had
slipped away from the shelter of the rock
but the briefest of inspections of the grass
ankle high which bordered the trail ex-
plained the mystery

  then as he listened the rapid drumming
of horses hoofs drifted to him from some-
where up the trail and he knew that the
outlaws were again in flight returning to
his pony he resumed the pursuit

ffipdjsl night came quickly and as the
darkness settled down like a
heavy blanket over the deep
canon he drew aside from the
trail and made camp he felt certain that
huddle and his companion were near and
he did not propose to furnish them with a
target for rifle practise that night

  he staked out his horse ate his supper of
crackers and dried beef and unrolling his
blankets lay down close to the trail well
toward morning he awoke a moon in the
last quarter was just showing itself above
the canon rim and its feeble light illumi-
nated vaguely a considerable stretch of the
trail ahead of him

  a blurred shapeless object showed at the
farther end of the trail an object that
moved but without sound a moments
observation and he had solved it the two
outlaws on foot and leading their horses
were trying to escape by the back trail
another second and raising his rifle he
fired twice just over the heads of their
horses the sudden flashes of his gun ad-
ded to the whine of the bullets threw a
panic into the two horses

  snorting with fear they whirled about
dragging the lead-ropes through the out-
laws fingers and went crashing up the back
trail with sudden agility the two outlaws
o

adventure

dropped to the ground and laced the elu-
sive darkness with a stream of bullets

  eunamtuck lying prone in the grass a
dozen yards from the spot that had wit-
nessed his attack chuckled to himself as he
watched their futile efforts to locate him
he did not fire again presently the two
outlaws gave it up and drawing back in
the shadows set off in the wake of their
runaway horses

  as far as eunamtuck was concerned he
had no intention of shooting one of the
men unless absolute necessity forced him
surely and steadily he was driving them
into a cul-de-sac from which they could not
escape they were nearing the headwaters
of the tillayuma and in its pinched-in canon
they would be effectually trapped for at its
upper end the tillayuma made a wild plunge
from a sheer wall of basalt down into a nar-
row gorge flanked on both sides by un-
scalable cliffs the only way out was along
a narrow shelf-like trail perched high above
the river and eunamtuck was on the
open end of that trail

  the next morning eunamtuck resumed
his tireless pursuit the first few hours
were but replicas of those of the preceding
day but along toward noon another diver-
sion occurred

  the trail here opened out into a meadow
just as if two huge bows had been placed
together string to string only the bows
were constructed of close-set trees backed
by cliffs the meadow was possibly three
hundred yards across at its widest point
and the trail of the two horses led straight
into it eunamtuck drew up his pony and
studied the situation with care

  the trees and bushes made it impossible
of approach undetected except on foot not
a sound was to be heard as he sat his horse
save the gentle soughing of the wind in the
pine trees it was too peaceful too idealis-
tic and the big indian shook his head at the
thought of riding across the open prairie

  he turned his pony around and rode back
along the trail for a short distance then
he dismounted and taking his rifle pushed
into the thicket and began to work his way
through the tangle of trees and bushes
toward the upper end of the tiny meadow
moving with the stealth of a cat in time he
approached the point where he suspected
that the outlaws might be concealed the
trees grew more sparsely here and at the
very edge where the meadow began was a

fringe of buck-brush eunamtuck dropped
to his knees and crawled warily out to this
hedgelike screen

  hardly had he reached its shelter when a
crow meditating high above in a dead
cottonwood tree spied him canting his
head sidewise the bird studied the intruder
with a beady eye voted him lacking in
confidence and rising leisurely from his
perch gave vent to his disapproval in his
raucous fashion inwardly cursing the
feathered detective eunamtuck crouched
lower and waited for developments they
came with amazing celerity and amply
demonstrated that other eyes were alert
that day other than the crows

  a mass of wild rosebushes growing scarce-
ly fifty yards away began erupting bullets
at that precise moment their destination
being the buck-brush which concealed but
did not shelter the chief of the tillayuma
police ripping through the tiny branches
the lead hail showered eunamtuck with
leaves and bits of twigs but save clipping
a half-circle neatly in the outer rim of his
big stetson he escaped unscathed

  the attack closed as abruptly as it began
and in a dozen pulse-beats eunamtuck
heard the sound of galloping horses and
knew that the outlaws were beating a
frenzied retreat he sat up and removing
his hat looked at the rent just contributed
to his already abused headpiece a slow
grin overspread his jovial face as he laid
the tip of a big brown finger inthe crescent-
like depression

  betta bitum yo dan me ol hat he
mused aloud in his quaint way no hur-
tun yo hiyu hurtum me yo bet yo
my life

  he went back to his horse and continued
the pursuit the outlaws had gained a
considerable lead but it did not worry their
pursuer the time was rapidly approach-
ing when they would be forced into a corner
and eunamtuck patiently waited for that
time to come

  and other events were shaping them-
selves in his favor for about two hours be-
fore sunset as he rounded an obtruding
shoulder of rock he saw some distance ahead
a horse standing beside the trail his first
thought was that it was a trick of some
sort but a second glance told him a very
different story

  grown tender-footed from the unac-
customed traveling on mountain trails the
the pursuit



horse had stumbled and broken a foreleg
about half-way between the knee and foot
he was a magnificent black and as he stood
there on three legs with the broken limb
dangling uselessly the heart of the big
indian went out to him in his helplessness

  dismounting he approached the aban-
doned saddle horse calling to him softly in
his way the injured animal did not move
even when eunamtuck reached out and
stroked his forehead now a crippled horse
is helpless enough under any circumstances
but his end in this wild region where bears
and panthers abounded would be only a
matter of hours yet eunamtuck did re-
luctantly the thing that the outlaws should
have done if they had had a grain of mercy
for their faithful ally drawing his heavy
revolver he put the horse out of his misery
as he stood looking down at the battered
feet of the dead horse he turned to his own
wise little pony and after his fashion ad-
dressed him

  chawenam he declared thy hoofs
of iron were made for trails like these

  again his eyes wandered back to the
other horse and suddenly a novel idea oc-
curred to him acting upon it he drew his
sheath knife and kneeling down quickly cut
away the wavy black mane rolled it into a
bundle and stowed it away in his pack
this done he swung lithely into his saddle
and set out once more in the wake of the
outlaws

the outlaws were in a desperate
plight for with but one horse be-
tween them and hip huddle a
cripple any chance they had had
to escape was now diminished by a good
deal more than half besides another day
would bring them to the end of the trail
where progress ahead was absolutely barred

  the tracks proved that huddle was
riding now with takamsin trailing behind
and it was equally evident to eunamtuck
that he was rapidly closing the gap between
them when night settled down in the black
gorge he felt that the pair were very near

  as on the previous night eunamtuck
camped near the trail before him was a
dense growth of trees and bushes possibly
a couple of acres in extent which he had
no doubt sheltered the outlaws like him
they would build no fire and to attempt to
stalk them in the velvety darkness would
be the work of a madman

  it was growing quite light when eunam-
tuck awoke sitting up in his blankets he
stretched his mighty arms above his head
while every rippling muscle in his great back
laughed with the joy of superb health to-
day the chase would end he told himself

  then to his acute ears there came the
sound of a muffled shot gaging its direc-
tion he concluded that it came from the
matted tangle of timber immediately before
him he got to his feet and picking up his
rifle set out to investigate

  progress through the heavy brush and
timber was a slow matter and the lingering
shadows added to his difficulties besides
he proceeded with great caution for the
shot might well be a trick to lure him into
their clutches he had penetrated well to-
ward the heart of the j umble of fallen logs and
great standing trees when he came upon a
small open space walled in completely on
every side by a hedge of bushes quite on
the farther side he made out the body of a
man lying on his face his head surrounded
by an irregular blotch that glinted dark
red in the feeble rays of light that straggled
through the obstructing foliage

  skirting the open space eunamtuck in
another minute had solved the mystery of
the lone shot he turned over the dead
outlaw to find himself looking into the dis-
torted face of hip huddle the bullet that
had killed him had been fired from behind
and at so close a range that his hair had
been badly burned by the exploding powder

  allowing the dead outlaw to settle back
gently on the grass eunamtuck stood erect
and at that moment to his alert ears there
came the sound of a galloping horse
takamsin was making a desperate effort to
escape and along the upper river the big
indian smiled grimly to himself as he
thought of the emotions of the fleeing man
when he found in the end that that avenue
was blocked by solid rock walls

  before he went back to his own camp
eunamtuck covered the murdered man with
logs and brush sufficient to keep prowling
animals away for the time at least he did
not stop to eat but saddling his pony once
more took up the pursuit so far there had
been a semblance of a trail but from this
point on it vanished completely all that
day was a succession of wild scrambles over
numberless tongues of rock slides that had
crept down from the heights above to the
very lip of the tumbling river


adventure

  not long before sunset eunamtuck came
upon the outlaws remaining horse standing
with drooping head at the foot of a fan-
shaped rockslide which the tender-footed
horse had been unable to scale so much
the tracks left in the treacherous shale in-
formed eunamtuck without a moments
hesitation eunamtuck leaped from his pony
and leaving him to keep company with the
abandoned thoroughbred scrambled up the
rockslide to solid footing above before
him stretched away a level rock causeway
hemmed in between the cliffs on his left
hand and the bank of the river on his right

  less than half a mile away the causeway
terminated abruptly at the falls of the tilla-
yuma where that turbulent stream leaped
down a full hundred feet over a barrier of
basalt into a seething whirlpool below the
thunder of the falling water drummed in
eunamtucks ears as his eye swept the
smooth unbroken course before him

  two hundred yards away takamsin was
running desperately toward the falls as if
he still hoped to find some avenue of escape
but escape was impossible and eunamtuck
chuckled to himself as he watched takamsin
sprinting madly for safety that did not
exist now with a tireless distance-de-
vouring stride the big indian leaped in
pursuit he gained with surprizing rapidity
and when takamsin reached the edge of
the frothing whirlpool at the foot of the
falls eunamtuck was less than a hundred
yards behind him

  and now for the first time takamsin
seemed to realize that he was effectually
trapped he swept the smooth rock walls
with a rapid glance and then without hesi-
tation leaped over the rim of the boiling
caldron and disappeared eunamtuck halt-
ed abruptly and edging over to the brink of
the sheer rock wall watched the river for
any signs of the outlaw presently takam-
sins big white hat came bobbing along on
the frothing water canted over drunkenly
and sank beneath the surface

  at sight of this eunamtuck shook his
head and then as if dismissing the whole
thing from his mind turned about and
slowly retraced his steps to the horses
which perhaps after all was a fortunate
thing for him to do for takamsin had not
taken the wild plunge into the whirlpool
but instead had leaped down on to a narrow
ledge which a few feet below hung like a nar-
row shelf mortised to the blank rock wall

  doubling around its upper edge he
scrambled up quickly behind a shattered
block of basalt which was perched on the
very edge above the frothing bowl of the
whirlpool he now had a complete view of
eunamtuck as he stood watching the antics
of takamsins hat as it drifted on the tur-
bulent waters

   he lay there eye glued to his rifle barrel
finger crooked round the trigger yet so
great was his fear of the redoubtable chief
of police that takamsin dared not fire at
that distance to miss from a rest at less
than a hundred yards seemed impossible
yet while he debated the chances with him-
self eunamtuck ended the mental argu-
ment by turning away

  with some difficulty eunamtuck man-
aged finally to get the two horses up around
the rock slide and in a few minutes had es-
tablished his camp in a small grove of
stunted black pine in full view of the falls
and the indian watching there

  behind the little grove was a tiny
meadow where he staked out the tired
horses to riot in the lush grass and now
for the first time in three days he built a
fire and cooked a meal a competent eater
at all times the big indian this time had
fairly eclipsed his former gastronomic ef-
forts when with a sigh of complete satis-
faction he stowed away the last scrap of
his gargantuan repast loosed his belt and
settled back to rest

  in the meantime takamsin from his hid-
ing place watched with greedy eyes the
smoke curling up from eunamtucks fire
and the evening breeze seemed almost to
carry the odor of the cooking food to his
twitching nostrils but takamsin knew
well the philosophy of patience and did not
propose now to imperil his precariously won
safety by a premature move

  his plan was simple with eunamtuck
completely off his guard he proposed to stalk
him under the cover of darkness kill him
with less compunction than he would have
a wolf repossess himself of his horse and
make a leisurely and unhampered escape

  to do this last was sufficient reason in
itself for the exercise now of great caution
but bulking huge above it even was the
certainty that he could glut his desire for
revenge in no other adequate way so
while darkness settled down tardily over
the river gorge takamsin watched the
twinkling light of the camp-fire and waited
the pursuit



the camp-fire had dwindled to
a mass of glowing embers when
takamsin paused on the outskirts
of the little grove and from the
shelter of a tree warily inspected the camp
and its surroundings the fire had been
built in a tiny open spot and its mild glow
was yet sufficient to light up everything
within a radius of a dozen feet with con-
siderable distinctness

  beyond the fire was a stunted pine tree
and hanging on the end of a broken limb
was eunamtucks big black stetson at
the foot of the tree between it and the
fire takamsin made out a form wrapped
in eunamtucks blankets and takamsin
grinned evilly as he caught sight of the
mass of black hair just peeping out from
under the gaudy blankets it offered a
mark impossible for him to miss at that
distance

  but he would make assurance doubly
sure so swinging a pack not unlike those
carried by boy scouts on hiking trips
noiselessly from his shoulders he crept still
nearer

  at a distance of not greater than ten
yards he halted again and raising his rifle
drew a bead on that thatch of hair sticking
out from under the blankets with deliber-
ation he held it under his rifle in the manner
of a gormand lingering over a dainty morsel
to kill the wily eunamtuck under any cir-
cumstances would be sheer joy but to do it
with such ease was adding a hilarious climax
to his elation

  immediately at the shot the lower end
of the blankets was thrown into violent
commotion observing which takamsin
dropped his gun and knife in hand leaped
eagerly across the intervening space ade-
quately to finish the pleasant task

  but as he stooped over with amazing
suddenness something thudded across the
back of his skull dropping him senseless in
his tracks

  consciousness returned slowly to takam-
sin and the first sight that met his be-
fuddled gaze was eunamtuck very much
alive smiling at him genially across the re-
juvenated camp-fire scowling in a crooked
ugly way at this unpalatable discovery
takamsin turned his attention to things at
hand

  he was seated on the ground his back
against the tree at the edge of the camp-
fire and around his body and the tree were

wound coil after coil of a rawhide lariat
had he been confined in a strait-jacket
he could not have been more helpless and
now to him was revealed the cunning man-
ner in which eunamtuck had ensnared him

  lying just beyond the reach of takam-
sins tattooing heels was a section of log
half as big around as his body and about
as long across its middle was still draped
eunamtucks gaudy blankets but both
ends were exposed and as he looked at it
takamsin ground his teeth in rage to
one end of the log was attached a rope now
slack and lying on the ground its free end
leading behind the tree to which he was
now so securely anchored

   the sight of the other end of the log drove
him simply mad with impotent rage for
around it was bound artfully the black mane
which eunamtuck had clipped from the
outlaws dead saddle horse

  eunamtuck observed the silent tribute to
his genius with pardonable elation pick-
ing up the rope he jiggled the log so that he
gave a poor imitation of a man kicking
lustily

  hiyu kickum he grinned at the dis-
comfited takamsin hiyu dead now he
added as the log ceased its mad gyrations
and came to rest dat first tam yo killum
log he inquired whimsically

  takamsin made no reply to this question
and after a minute eunamtuck continued

  dis afternoon me seeum yo all a tam at
falls me know yo no jumpum in rivah
yo heap fraid do dat but me no want to
killum yo me tink dis better way gettum
yo now yo hang sure yo bet yo my
life

  that is as it may be takamsin said
gutturally in nez perces but i am not in
tekoa and doubtless i will escape

  thou wilt not escape eunamtuck re-
plied positively in the same tongue think
of one who has escaped from me and name
him there is no one

   i will escape takamsin replied bravely
though in his evil heart he felt misgivings
for he knew that eunamtucks calm state-
ment was the exact truth

  no prisoner had ever come to his free-
dom once the wily chief of police had had
his powerful hands upon him and yet
might not he takamsin prove to be the
one exception

  leaving the morose outlaw to brood over
his plight eunamtuck walked over to the


adventure

spot where he had seen takamsin drop his
pack in a moment he returned with it
and laying it upon the ground in the full
light of the crackling camp-fire he un-
buckled the heavy straps and threw back
the canvas flap even he stolid indian
that he was emitted an ejaculation of
astonishment for the knapsack was liter-
ally jammed full with packages of bank-
notes

  eunamtuck with some little awe lifted
out one of the neat flat packages and
studied it with respect the notes were
new and the denomination fifty dollars
also he noted that they were bills of the first
national bank of tekoa with that dis-
covery a new light was suddenly thrown
upon the whole perplexing problem of the
last three days

  he turned upon takamsin

  yo robbum bank tekoa he said accus-
ingly yo tink me knowum yo robbum
yo try to killum me for dat hunh yo
killum huddle so yo gettum all dat monish
hunh takamsin yo hias cultus mans

  to the flat accusation that he was a very
bad man the outlaw entered no denial but
instead his manner underwent a sudden
change

  thirty thousand dollars is there he
said artfully half of it will make you
rich take it and let me go

  eunamtuck raised his big hand threat-
eningly and the trussed-up man shrank from
the expected blow but eunamtuck did
not strike him

  i have said he remarked dispassion-
ately in the nez perces language almost as
if speaking to himself that you will hang
therefore i eunamtuck must not kill
you nevertheless i can stop your wag-
ging tongue with this and he pointed sig-
nificantly to his silk neck-handkerchief

  thou art a fool takamsin spat out

  nevertheless he retired into a discreet
silence for to be gagged indefinitely offered
no very alluring prospect

  whether eunamtuck slept or not takam-
sin did not know of a certainty but at any
rate he found the other awake whenever he
stole a furtive glance in his direction

  at daybreak they ate breakfast and were
soon on their way always the watchful
eye of the chief of police was on his prisoner
and though takamsin revolved ceaselessly
numberless plans of escape not the slightest
opportunity presented itself near evening

they halted at the spot where takamsin had
murdered hip huddle and now under
eunamtucks urging the reluctant indian
heaped above his victim stones and brush
till the dead outlaw was effectually shielded
from marauding animals

  on the fifth day just past the noon hour
they rode into tekoa and eunamtuck
promptly delivered his prisoner to the
sheriff shaking off that voluble officer
eunamtuck took his leisurely way to the
bank and entered it unobtrusively and
passed on to where the president of the
bank john kellough sat hunched up
gloomily over some correspondence the
robbery added to the death of two of his
employees had been a heavy blow to the
banker and now as the big indians shadow
fell across his desk he looked up with some
show of annoyance

  want to see me eunamtuck he asked
a little tartly

  without replying eunamtuck stepped in-
side and sat down with the canvas knap-
sack held on his knees

  me tink me got someting for yo he
stated calmly

  then while the banker waited in
some wonder eunamtuck methodically
unstrapped the bag and unceremoniously
tumbled its contents out upon the desk

  my --- j kellough sputtered mean-
while pawing at the money with twitching
fingers where did you get it

  back in mountains eunamtuck an-
swered placidly

  forgetful of decorum kellough fairly
whooped out his joy which quickly brought
a scurrying crowd of employees to rejoice
with him

  eventually their delirium passed suffi-
ciently to enable them to make a tabulated
check of the recovered bills

  its all there but twenty dollars kel-
lough announced with a sigh of relief at the
close of the check

  at that with a chuckle of remembrance
eunamuck drew out of his pocket a badly
crumpled twenty-dollar bill and tossed it
over to the banker

  me findum dat bill at dere camp de
first morning he exclaimed cheerfully
me smellum takamsin carry um all
right pullum out him pocket dat night

kellough said happily here- he held
out a package of bills to the indian-take
this the bank offered a reward of a thou-
sand dollars for the recovery of the money
and youve won it

but the big indian only shook his head
me chief of police he stated without
emotion me findum monish me bring-
um back yo dats all right me no

the big indian sat unmoved for

face

 one in his senses would have
taken deacon munden for a
j fighter he was too delicately
	molded he was a little above

medium height and well-framed but slim
undeveloped tender looking nor had he
the face of a fighter it was a thin face
with hollow cheeks small though finely
made features and a broad smooth fore-
head he had big blue eyes serious eyes
that seldom smiled and never frowned and
thick brown hair

  light the deacon abhorred the word
he loved peace the son of a minister he
had been born and reared to revere that
word so far as any one on that ship could
see his only reason for enlisting in the navy
was to carry the love-thy-neighbor doctrine
out upon the high and briny blue where the
best of men will sometimes forget them-
selves hark to the call of the brute within
and fight

  a pacifist to the roots of him deac
he never failed to show up just in time to
stop a fight always the moment an argu-
ment attained that white-hot point where
the two shipmates began smearing mud on
each others ancestors in came the deacon
softly gently but ever so impressively
and he never failed to turn an exchange of
blows into a handshake

  no he was no sissy at least none of the
rolling lous five hundred bluejackets had
ever so dubbed him there was nothing
effeminate about deac he was a lad of
fine sensibilities and as fine a shipmate as



ever donned a flat hat he didnt smoke
chew drink swear-but who could hate
him for that he never changed three
and a half years he had been on the big
scout cruiser ever since leaving the training
station and he had always been the same-
quiet retiring though never haughtily
aloof conscientious in his duties which
were those of a yeoman in the pay-office
always intensely in earnest and ever glad to
hand over his last nickle to a worthy cause
a sissy isnt the tiniest part of that

  then one balmy sunny morning when the
lou was bound south to join the fleet at
guantanamo bay cuba the winter rendez-
vous quite by accident a shipmate discov-
ered that the deacon had a flaw the
shipmate was jimmy forbes a brawny
machinists mate he chanced to lay hold
of deac by the ribs from behind in one of
those affectionate hows-the-old-boy ways
just below the armpits as deac leaned over
the rail watching the flying fish rise out of
the dark blue water and go soaring

  never had those gobs on the lous top-
side witnessed such antics the deacon
leaped four feet straight up he came
down spinning his fists whirling about him
like the propeller blades of an aeroplane
and in that moment he performed a jekyll-
hyde shift of personalities when he
stopped whirling there was blazing red in
his eyes and he was snarling like a wolf

  big forbes stood there grinning the
deacon charged him he swung his right
fist as he charged such a wallop just
the corruption of deacon munden

 

alongside of the point of forbes chin on the
button the big man dropped like a log

  that was all when forbes came to
several minutes later deac wanted to give
him his bag hammock and ditty-box all
humbleness self-abasement deac would
have given forbes all the money he had on
the books two years pay deac rarely
drew money on a pay day didnt need any
forbes however was a good sport he
grinned and they shook hands

  thus began deacs troubles from that
moment on his was a rocky road his
bosom secret was out like wildfire the
word flashed about the big scouts decks-
the deacon had sensitive ribs forthwith
every gob on the ship wanted to prod him in
those ribs which they did from that day
on whenever and wherever they caught
him napping leaning over the rail seated
on a chest or ditty-box asleep in his ham-
mock

  not that the rolling lous gobs were
mean small-natured they were normal
bluejackets always ready to go the limit
take a black eye a broken nose a few
broken ribs anything within reason to stir
up a kick of excitement

  deac neither blackened any eyes nor
broke any noses but more than one man
did he put to sleep with that right swing
he always planted his fist on the button
most times he clipped the wrong man for
in the few red moments following one of
those proddings all faces looked alike to
deac he got the nearest shipmate and
nine times out of ten some innocent

  once he came near caving in a shipmates
ribs mule-fashion deac did that threw
up both heels when the man crept up be-
hind him at the rail and jabbed him in the
ribs his would-be tormentor just grunted
unk and down he went but the worst
of that was deac went overboard in the
bargain

  still they gave him no peace day in
day out they kept it up the lou arrived
at guantanamo bay and anchored in the
maze of battleships cruisers destroyers
tugs and auxiliaries weeks passed the
deacon became the talk of the fleet gobs
and gobs from other ships came visiting
aboard the lou solely for the purpose of
witnessing one of those much talked of
ticklings of deacon munden he came to
be known as the most ticklish man in the
navy

  deac was a much-worried lad dark
semicircles appeared below his eyes and the
hollows in his cheeks grew deeper he re-
tired into himself became sullen and glum
in moody silence he remained close to his
desk in the pay-office there with his
back to the bulkhead he was free from their
ruthless goadings also he slept there in

the pay-office he was seen about decks
only when on his way to meals and then he
moved swiftly as the crow flies and kept
an eye peeled over each shoulder

  he probably would have thus finished the
remaining two months of his enlistment
mewed up in the pay-office but fate had
decreed otherwise one afternoon through
the open portholes in the pay-office deac
heard voices that caused him to stiffen in his
chair they were angry snarling voices
deac arose stepped over to a porthole and
stood listening

  yes it was an argument up on the fore-
castle the voices he recognized as those of
slug mathews and bull wilson they
were wrangling over the big fight scheduled
for that evening over at fishermans point
between mickey dover the best welter-
weight in the fleet and alonzo cruz a fast
cuban

  this bout was the biggest event of the
winter the gobs of the fleet were backing
mickey dover down to their socks and
their money had been finding eager takers
fifty thousand dollars of fleet money had


adventure

been pooled and given into the hands of an
american promoter in havana every dol-
lar of it was covered then in the last
moment this very morning from the battle-
ship on which mickey dover was serving
the minnie had come the word that the
fight might have to be called off that dover
had injured his right shoulder in working
out it was this that led up to the argu-
ment between slug and bull up on the
forecastle to which deac was listening
through the porthole in the pay-office

i said it an ill say it again
growled the voice of slug bum
shoulder me eye dovers got a
case o yeller hes afraid o the
greaser

  now bull wilson deac knew was one of
mickey dovers most fanatical admirers
therefore he wasnt surprized at bulls
snappy return

  an ill tell you just this once more
slug mathews an yuh better git me
do that kind o thinkin under your lid
dont gas off about mickey dover where
i can hear yuh

  slug retorted that he would gas off when
where and to whom he pleased and if any
cared not to listen they could stuff their
ears bull retaliated with a statement to
the effect that slugs great-grandfather
had had a yellow streak

  it had gone far enough thought deac
it must be repeated that by nature educa-
tion and habit he was a pacifist he bolted
out of the pay-office ran aft up a ladder
then galloped forward to the forecastle

  arms crooked fists bunched heads thrust
forward slug and bull stood glaring at each
other like two mad gorillas both were
bull-necked heavy-jowled leather-skinned
and could fight the outcome was a toss-up

  stepping between them deac placed a
hand against each of their lusty chests and
gently thrust them apart

  fellows be shipmates he said in
low earnest tones whatsoever ye would
that thy shipmate should do to you do you
even so to him

  id have im blacken me eye if hes
able snarled slug

  ony one way to find out bull retorted
each tried to clear deacs outstretched arm
and get to the other but with a death
grip at the v of each of their jumpers deac
held them apart and while so doing he

talked in that low convincing way of his
quoting fragments of the sermon on the
mount and interspersing these with frag-
ments of his own simple but sound philoso-
phy they stopped growling the red left
their eyes they relaxed and listened one
had to listen to deac he had the gift of
compelling attention it was partly per-
sonality the serious unpretentious attitude
of him and partly the happy knack he had
of expressing himself

  finally he took the right hand of slug and
placed it within the right hand of bull

  be shipmates he said and backed out
from between them a faint smile on his
fine sensitive face

  as deac backed away forward rubbing
his hands together as if washing them of
pollution slug and bull turned and stood
shoulder to shoulder watching him grins
on their hard faces those grins however
were not occasioned by anything funny they
saw in deac they were looking beyond
deac at another shipmate one slippery
sanders who with the stealthy silence of a
shadow was creeping up behind the dea-
con the deacon was about to be jabbed

  watch your step slug grunted in an
aside to bull

  watch yours bull returned

  the same warning was being flashed
from nearly every pair of eyes on the fore-
castle for when deac was poked in the
ribs no man on that ship cared to be in the
way of his wallop besides the deacon
himself the only man on the forecastle who
was not on tiptoe in that moment was en-
sign woodward the rolling lous athletic
officer he had just stepped out of the
break of the superstructure deck and was
walking forward his eyes on the deck to-
tally unaware of what was coming off

  almost in the snap of a finger it happened
no one laughed this time there was
nothing to laugh at instead of a comedy
the lous gobs witnessed a tragedy just
as ensign woodward came up behind slug
and bull-these standing shoulder to shoul-
der facing deacon a dozen feet forward-
slippery sanders reached out a long arm and
jabbed deac in the ribs

  deac let out an undignified squawk
urkand shot straight up he landed
sitting down but bounced right up again
for a few seconds he spun when he
stopped his wild eyes were blazing like an
infuriated tigers at slug and bull still
the corruption of deacon munden



shoulder to shoulder a dozen feet away a
moment he glared then he rushed them
they separated bull dodging inboard slug
outboard deac plunging between them
straight into ensign woodward

  ensign woodward was an all-around
athlete a bulldog on the gridiron a whirl-
wind on the diamond and an artist in the
ring-as clever a boxer as annapolis ever
had he saw deac coming just in time to
meet him with a stiff-arm jab deac went
under it driving his right and left to the
officers ribs and he followed that up
with a shower of rights and lefts ensign
woodward backed away covering up as
best he could

  with a dozen shipmates crowding up be-
hind him deac followed up his man eager
hands reached out and tried to grab him
but as well might they have tried to lay hold
of a squirming wildcat and no less vain
wre their lusty efforts to shout reason into
his ears in those few moments of red the
deacon was impervious to reason he was
stark mad he had his eye on just one
thing-that chin before him to plant his
fist on that chin was the one maniacal de-
sire that dominated him he didnt know
it was an officers chin he didnt know it
was anybodys in particular

  one pair of hands did succeed in clutching
deacs arm between shoulder and elbow
deac jerked it free then with a backhand
swipe rapped the well-meaning shipmate
across the mouth with his knuckles his
mouth full of blood the well-meaning ship-
mate staggered away backward deac
then made another lunge for his man bull
wilson leaped in front of him deacs
right fist flashed in an overheard arc
spat on the button bull never knew
what struck him

  stand clear everybody ensign wood-
ward shouted let im come

  it was too one-sided to be called a fight
indeed ensign woodward was an artist
with his fists he had that happy combina-
tion of speed and judgment that makes
champions he outweighed the deacon
by twenty pounds he had reach and height
on him but he was outclassed with all
his skill he could not touch this whirlwind of
fury he got no opportunity even to try to
touch deac deac came right in-zip
spat thud-and the best the officer could do
was back away and cover up and keep on
covering up

  it lasted only a minute again deacs
right fist flashed in a sweeping overhead arc
it would have been a sturdy jaw that could
have withstood the shock of that terrific
smash and it was on the button

the red was now dimming
away quivering like a jelly-fish
deac stood over the fallen officer
he saw everything in a blur as
through befogged glasses and the voices
about him seemed to come from afar he
felt only half awake as one coming out of
a hideous nightmare his shipmates were
jostling him aside he heard

  come on lets get em down to the sick
bay easy now easy come on shake a
leg lets go

  and before his swimming vision passed
the two groups bearing ensign woodward
and bull wilson away toward the forward
hatch which led down to the sick bay

  deac knew nausea as he staggered out-
board to the rail he was trembling to his
hair-ends and finger-tips in the swirling
haze about him were scores of faces all
looking at him not one of them wore a
grin only dark gray sympathy on all
sides and on his ears fell the somber
words

  great god man oh man wallopin
an officer ten years

  a powerful hand clutched at his elbow
deac turned to face catfoot snell the
chief master-at-arms or ships chief of
police then snells gruff voice-

  awright you fightin sky pilot just
steam along with your uncle

  aft down two ladders to the berth deck
then forward to the brig or ships prison
snell marched him a choking lump rose
to deacs throat as catfoot pushed him
over the threshold into the five by seven
cell a bang of the door a click of the key
and there he was like a trapped rat in
a dark and stuffy dungeon with only a ten-
inch porthole heavily barred to admit air
and daylight

  deac paced athwartships three short
steps each way it was the darkest hour
of his twenty-three years worse there
were darker hours to come he was
headed for prison an unprovoked assault
on an officer why in the navy men were
sentenced to longer prison terms for that
offense than for stealing

  prison


adventure

  a chill shook him as he uttered the word
and it echoed back to him again and again
till his stuffy dungeon seemed to ring with
it prison he groaned as he imaged
the white faces of his mother and father
when this cruel intelligence reached them

  that choking lump was again in his
throat as he visioned his faded but still
beautiful little mother doubt in her big
blue eyes as she spoke the words

  prison our boy richard in prison

  and how would his sober serious-man-
nered father the pale little small-town
preacher in new england face his sunday
morning flock after this

  young dick munden is in a naval
prison would be in every mouth

  it would be the talk of the town how
he had disgraced his mother and father
and there were those who would sneer

  i thought so he should have gone to
prison long ago when he all but murdered
jack summers yes hes where he be-
longs

  those were bad moments for deac bit-
ter and rebellious were his feelings as the
unjustness of his plight burrowed in on him
abruptly the faith education of his entire
life fell from him he began questioning
where was this gods justice his father ex-
horted about in the dealing of the cards
for instance one being was birthed to a
throne another in the gutter one got a
royal flush on the deal another a hoboken
straight one was born a master mind an-
other an imbecile why why

  he knew how his father would answer
to this

  gods ways my son are not for man to
question

  perhaps but it didnt look fair to deac
down there in his dark little dungeon he
felt that he hadnt received a fair deal
that the cards had been stacked against him
he had been born thus with proud ribs
how could a fellow help what was wrought
in the very textures and fibers of him he
had striven hard to overcome this weakness

  prison he hadnt wilfully committed a
crime what he had done he had done
because he was so made had they left
him alone he wouldnt have done it the
shipmate whose thumb had rendered him
red-eyed should be thrown into prison
not he

  a black hour passed then the key
rattled in the lock and the door opened

deac didnt look around for he knew it was
catfoot he continued leaning against the
outboard bulkhead gazing through the port-
hole bars at the westering sun

  say you catfoot growled got a knife
on yuh

  without turning his head deac fished out
his jackknife and held it out behind him
catfoot then reached out and took deacs
neckerchief from him

  whats the idea queried the deacon

  catfoot only grunted and grinned and
went out slamming the door

  deac too was grinning now what
could have given the chief jimmy such a
wild notion that he deac might cut his
throat or hang himself with his necker-
chief what did catfoot think he was a
lunatic no doubt then-and with the
thought the grin froze on deacs face-then
perhaps after all they wouldnt send him
to prison indeed his chances looked far
better for the red house

  came another thought and it smote
him like a blow from a sledge hammer
he had struck an officer the officers
head had crashed on the hard deck had
he-

  sweat broke through deacs skin from
head to toes cold sweat a moment
longer he clung with his fingers to the rim
of the porthole then his fingers relaxed their
hold his knees gave way and he sagged
down to the deck

  sunset-then twilight still deac sat
huddled against the outboard bulkhead
numb in body and brain and cold he
wanted to get up and pound on that steel
door bring some one any one and find out
but fear over-rode the impulse he wanted
to know but shrank from the terror of
knowing

  murder the word flooded his conscious-
ness in his disordered mind he heard it
being shouted at him he saw it printed in
big red letters across the bulkheads

  the door opened again deac saw two
pairs of shoes the overhead light was
switched on then catfoots voice-

   ill skate aft sir an bring the mess cook
with his chow

  that sir deac looked up into the
pale but smiling face of ensign woodward
had some one tickled him deac wouldnt
have straightened up to his feet more
quickly he shot up for a moment he
stood there reeling drunkenly one hand to
the corruption of deacon munden



his forehead unbelief in his glassy eyes
then in a high thin voice

  youre not dead sir

  catfoot went out ensign woodward
closed the door then turned and grinned at
the deacon with one hand he was strok-
ing a jaw that was apparently sore only
his upper lip moved when he spoke

  munden he began slowly and with
great distinctness  what - in - the - e -
blazes ever made you come at me

  a tough one for poor deac he squirmed
and fidgeted a few moments then 
i was tickled sir

  yes i know ive heard but-

  things went red sir deac broke in
its alwaysthat way when some one pokes
me in the ribs from behind i go wild
dont know what im doing and sail right
into the first one i see ive always been
that way sir from a baby up you hap-
pened to be in the way i didnt know it
was you sir

the young officer studied deacs
wrought-up features there was
no doubting the sincerity in those
deep-blue eyes he had always
liked this youngster for his clean earnest
ways and despite that terrific wallop on
his formidable jaw he liked him none the
less now if anything he liked him more
for that very wallop

  why should i do anything like that
sir deac added even if i had reason
to bear you a grudge its a general court-
martial offense to strike an officer

  ensign woodward nodded soberly
thats why i came to see you he said
im going aft to the captain in a few min-
utes hes sent for me no doubt its
concerning this affair he wants to see me
and i wanted to talk to you first-because
-well i didnt think you knew exactly
what you were doing up there anyhow
im not going to prefer any charge against
you

  deac thanked him not profusely but
earnestly

  however the officer resumed i cant
promise i dont know- he hesitated
frowning-its hard telling how the cap-
tain will look at things youre acquainted
with his ways ive an idea hell hand me

the-balling out an officer ever got for

declining to press the charge chances
are the old hookerll push things against you

himself anyhow but well do the best we
can

  deac thanked him again there was a
queer flicker in ensign woodwards dark
eyes now

  by the way he broke off you seem to
know a lot about throwing those fists of
yours and you swing a pretty heavy wal-
lop feeling of his sore jaw for a lad of
your weight who taught you all that
stuff

  deac smiled sadly

  i never was taught sir he answered
i used to do a lot of boxing i was always
keen for the sport-that is boxing not
fighting i wouldnt fight a man in the ring
for a million dollars nor would i go a hop-
skip-and-jump to see a championship fight
i dont call that sport sir-two men trying
to batter each other into insensibility
bestiality i call it along with the spanish
bull-fight it belongs in-- sir

  ensign woodward shook his head and
grinned

  youre just a wee bit bigoted there
lad he said indulgently comparing the
american prize fight to the spanish bull-
fight nay nay my son thats about ninety-
nine per cent fallacy i think i could
convince you if i had the time anyhow
well just scud over that you say you
used to put the mitts on a lot you liked the
sport

  for the science of it yes sir

  uh-huh but how is it that in the three
and a half years youve been on this ship
weve never seen you put on the gloves
with any one

  for a few moments deac swallowed and
looked down at the deck

  thats only half of the story sir he
said finally the rest of it is you never
will see me put on the gloves with any one
the last time i had them on was and will be
the last time that was five years ago
sir

  of course thats your affair ensign
woodward said no doubt youve a good
reason

  i have sir and i dont mind telling
it to you the last time i had the gloves
on i came within an ace of causing the
death of the best friend ive ever had

  lose your head

  in a clinch yes sir deac replied
we were sparring a fellow named jack
summers and i in a clinch he got his


adventure

arms around me and dug his thumb into
my ribs i dont know what happened in
the few moments after that all i remem-
ber is red i went mad sir just as i did
this afternoon they told me afterward
that all i did was push jack clear and swing
i struck him on the jaw and he fell his
head struck on a stone

  oh he came around finally but there
were days and days hopeless days when he
lingered between life and death and me-
well i dont like to talk about it

  it was a bad turn in the road for me sir
i couldnt describe what my feelings were
everything seemed changed i felt like
some one different none of my former am-
bitions or desires any longer appealed id
always been a hungry reader i now de-
tested books baseball and football dis-
gusted me and the mere thought of boxing
would drive me into a fit of madness com-
panionship the sound of a human voice
made me hold my ears

  what made things worse- was-well
there was a girl about that time sir also
there were a few long noses in that town
and they commenced to sniff pretty soon
a lot of scandal suckers commenced to lick
their lips over their teacups and behind
their fans they proceeded to grind me into
sausage id done the deed on purpose
they said because i was jealous of jack
summers if not then i belonged in a
madhouse

  i was only eighteen had just finished
high school my people wanted to send
me to college they had me headed for
the pulpit you can imagine sir deac
grinned how the long noses must have
sniffed over that anyhow i didnt go to
college i couldnt i wasnt in mental
shape for anything all i could do was
brood about in moody silence and thats
all i did sir for over a year

  thats how i come to be in the navy
sir this life appealed seemed to offer what
i needed-excitement adventure anyhow
it was a change chances are if i hadnt
enlisted id now be in some lunatic asylum

  deac paused a moment and then added
with a grin

  as things look now sir ive still got a
royal chance for that the red house
anyhow thats why you never see me put
on the gloves with anyone

  catfoot now returned accompanied by
the mess cook who brought deacs supper

on a large tray sauerkraut ana bow-wows
prunes bread butter and tea

  well- ensign woodward roused him-
self - that was unfortunate however
were getting away from the issue i must
get aft ill see you later munden and
well talk things over

  the officer backed out the mess cook
put the tray on deck and then followed
suit catfoot slammed shut the door and
deac was alone with his sauerkraut and
bow-wows and prunes

  deac ate nothing he passed another
long and somber hour booking out through
the bars of his porthole night was now on
and thousands of lights shone the great
fleet looked like a city on the water soft
music floated on the cool night breeze
boats plied to and fro tooting their whistles
some of them close enough to send waves
pelting with a splash against the lous side
a few feet below deacs barred porthole

  now she swung with the tide so that deac
could see the majestic flagship anchored out
near the harbor entrance at the head of and
midway between the two columns of dread-
naughts and battleships she was sending
a message to the fleet by blinker

  deac knew the code which is the same
as used in radio but he was not quite up to
the speed with which that signalman on the
flagship was ripping it off he could read
only a word or two here and there he
made it out to be something about to-
nights big fight he got the words sub-
stitute mickey dover nine oclock
fishermans point and a few other frag-
ments pertaining to landing facilities

  then catfoot brought the mess cook back
for the dishes

  whos taking mickeys place tonight
chief deac said to catfoot

  how the-do i know snarled the

hard-boiled chief and what the-do

you care figurin on goin are yuh

  no but i thought you were

  yah me hey fat chance i got o
seein the fight with a general court-martial
prisoner on me hands

  whats a matter deac aint yuh
scoffin put in the mess cook standing
akimbo looking down at the tray of un-
touched food

  hes on a hunger strike growled cat-
foot

  just what do you mean a general court-
martial prisoner deac demanded i
the corruption of deacon munden



havent even been up before the captain

  yaint hey catfoot grinned well
yuh will be in about fifteen minutes the
old mans gonna hold special mast for yuh
what this evening

  you heard me theyre gonna barbe-
cue you so quick itll make yuh dizzy be
standin by

  bang went the door

  mast this time of the day deac won-
dered hed never heard of the captain of
a man-o-war holding mast in the evening
mast you should know means court

bear blackstone captain
of the rolling lou was notorious
for his hard-boiled qualities he
wept tears of joy every time
he awarded a general court-martial his
executive officer carbolic wiltz was of
the same clay in the matter of being hard
and mean in fact these two were as nearly
alike as two men could be slightly harder
than either of them though in a coarser
way was catfoot snell

  little mercy could a poor gob in trouble
expect from that combination stepping
up before that high portable desk-the
bears bar of judgment-was like marching
to the gallows they had the poor culprit
sentenced before the charge against him was
read usually if he did have anything to
say in his defense he didnt say it they
scared it out of him with the owl-eyed
florid and gray-whiskered face of the bear
in front of him carbolics hawk eyes and
eagle beak to the left and catfoots bulldog
mug to the right whatever the unfortunate
gob might have in mind by way of palliation
or vindication froze there

  and yet once in a while old bear black-
stone showed a twist of humanness for
one thing he had a colossal sense of humor
that was the way to the heart of the bear
through his risibles a man who could
make him laugh could have anything  he
was hard to tickle but once tickled the
thunder gusts of laughter he belched forth
would dim the trumpings of an elephant to
faint whisperings

  he had two other weaknesses one was
raw meat well pass over that the
other was prize fighters a good pug was
sure of many favors and rapid promotion on
the bears ship

  ensign woodward took advantage of

those weak spots in the bears make-up that
evening five minutes after saluting him
back on the quarter-deck ensign wood-
ward had him chuckling a few minutes
more and he had him roaring and as they
paced fore and aft back on the bears
private section of the quarter-deck in the
outer verge of the glow from the gangway
lights looking for all the world like santa
claus and beau brummel the bears con-
vulsive gusts grew louder and louder

  forward about the gangways in the
glare of the lights crowded gobs and gobs
eager expectancy shone on every face
they were waiting for the word on the big
fight who was to take mickey dovers
place against alonzo cruz was still unknown
they had their good dollars on that fight
those rolling lou tars nearly all of them up
to the skipper inclusive forsooth the old
bear himself had a thousand dollars on the
american but this was a dark secret

  seven oclock still nothing definite on
the fight the waiting gobs began to chafe
the bear and ensign woodward still had
their heads together back in the dim light
of the bears sanctum sanctorum

  then abruptly that confab broke up
ensign woodward saluted the bear and
then sauntered away forward the bear
bellowed for his orderly the orderly came
on the gallop

  signal blank signal blank shouted
the bear

  and as the marine went galloping away
after the pad of blanks his hirsuteness
roared to the officer of the deck

  inform the executive officer im going
to hold mast in twenty minutes have the
chief master-at-arms bring the prisoner aft
bear a hand

  when the orderly came racing aft with
the pad of blanks the bear snatched it from
him he then stepped briskly forward to
the gangway light and there wrote a mes-
sage to the fleet athletic officer

  to the bridge to the bridge he
barked at the orderly who took the mes-
sage at arms length have them send
that to the flagship rush

it was twenty minutes passed
seven when catfoot marched
deac aft to the guillotine deac
knocked his heels before the high
desk which stood on the quarter-deck a
little abaft of the starboard gangway


adventure

saluted took off his hat and stood at atten-
tion facing the bear who stood behind the
desk his short squat figure firmly planted
his strawberry-like nose shining like a
beacon in the glare of the gangway light his
gray whiskers glistening his round goggling
eyes blazing like a cats

  out of the corner of his left eye deac saw
a sharp point or hook rather-carbolics
nose-and a little above it two glittering
beady eyes on his right was the scowling
mug of catfoot they had him going and
coming like a man awaiting the noose
or the ax he was beyond all succor human
or providential his sheet anchor was gone
so to speak he was totally at the mercy
of the notorious trio the father son and
holy terror

  a hum of confused mutterings and whis-
perings rose from the lous upper deck as
the ships writer a thin little chief yeoman
read the charge-

  assaulting an officer

  there was some slight stir then a hush
fraught with ominousness as the bear
cleared his throat it sounded like the
rumble of distant thunder ensign wood-
ward slipped up from the sidelines and
stood looking over deacs shoulder at the
bear for a moment the bear glared back
at him over deacs shoulder then shift-
ing his glare to deac he sniffed as sniffs a
real bear when he scents meat his whiskers
bristled and then from up out of the fat of
him came a swinish grunt

  yesh-yesh-yesh-yes he prefaced with
his woftted bruskness ah-ah-ah-ah-
have you anything to say

  sir i- deac began
yesh-yesh-yesh-yes the bear cut him
off thatll do thatll do that will do
with which the bear turned and said to
carbolic-

  the cat-o-nine-tails would be the rem-
edy eh

  carbolics hook went up and down in em-
phatic concurrence and his beady eyes glit-
tered with satanic glee at mention of that
obsolete instrument of persuasion

  in the old navy the bear went
on to deac we used to settle cases of
this description-ah-just like that-
snapping his fingers three four five

hundred lashes of the cat- his voice

broke

  i seen em git worse n that sir catfoot
oared in

  you shut up the bear snapped-side-
wise at him and then went on

  in the american navy there are just
two things worse than a man who will strike

an officer

  he hesitated a moment then all in a
breath he shouted

  a murderer and a pervert

  he paused

  have you anything to say

  deac swallowed and stammered but
could form no words ensign woodward
spoke up

  captain may i speak a few words
certainly you may not with which
the bear burst forth in oration he
plunged into a ponderous discourse on the
virtues of discipline and the evils of laxity
in dealing with breaches of discipline as
he warmed up to his subject his voice rose
in pitch and volume he brought arms and
hands into play waved grandly drove fist
into palm banged on the desk time and
again with tears gushing from his big
glassy eyes and his whole frame shaking
with emotion he harked back to the
bygone days when the navy had the
cat-o-nine-tails for fifteen minutes he
bellowed his face was scarlet one min-
ute and white the next at times he lost
the thread of his argument and all he em-
itted was an incoherent jumble of snarls
and growls

  cat-o-nine-tails thousand lashes
cut off his ears hang him to the yard-
arm by the tongue he reserved just
breath enough to ask deac if he had any-
thing to say

  sir i- deac began again

    y esh-yesh-yesh-y es that-will-do  
but deac was not of the stuff that can be
scared to death with mere noise

  sir he persisted firmly when i en-
listed in the united states navy i didnt
cease to be an american i claim the con-
stitutional right-

  silence thundered the bear with a
bang of his fist on the desk what deac
had said however had him stumped for
the moment he was disconcerted he
turned to carbolic

  any suggestion mr wiltz

  why - ah -  carbolic fidgeted ner-
vously ah-ah-well its a case sir that
calls for all possible promptness of action
brevity i should suggest that justice be
administered without delay sir
the corruption of deacon munden



  yesh-yesh-yes without delay to be
sure

  whereupon the bear heaved a great sigh
then leaning over the desk so that his be-
whiskered face was a foot from deacs he
queried

  did you say something about con-
stitutional right

  yes sir and deacs chin was high
and his shoulders well back as he went on
my ancestry on both sides traces back to
the puritans sir i claim the constitutional
right of an american the right to state my
case the right to fight sir

  the bear stiffened for a few seconds
his goggling eyes met deacs then they
shifted to the left and came to rest on en-
sign woodwards conscious looks passed
between these two silent communication

  yesh-yes the bear said the right
to fight-to fight oh i say mr wood-
ward he claims the right to fight

  and then with a flash of his eyes a grin
and a bang of his fist on the desk-
swallowed the hook by thunder

  but if those gobs looking on from the side-
lines expected to hear the bear say general
court-martial they got fooled for the
next thing old bruno did was turn and roar
at the officer of the deck

  my bahge my bahge my bahge
the bugler intercepted the command and
promptly sounded the call for the captains
barge to come alongside the gangway

  all hands were now on tiptoe every
one wondered what the bear could be pull-
ing off

  this mast will adjourn boomed old
santa claus and reconvene at nine oclock
tomorrow morning if necessary

  then after a moments pause he turned
and addressed ensign woodward

  you have your instructions mr wood-
ward take charge of the prisoner and pro-
ceed on duty assigned

  aye aye sir ensign woodward re-
sponded and then took deac by the arm
and led him over to the gangway

  there they waited while the captains
barge swung out from the forward boom
swerved round astern and came up along-
side ensign woodward saluted the officer
of the deck and requested permission to
leave the ship on duty

very well said the officer of the deck
then arm in arm ensign woodward and
deac went down the gangway and stepped

into the waiting barge a clang of the
gong a rush of water and away they raced
across the crowded harbor toward fisher-
mans point

   it was now beginning to filter through the
heads of the lous tars the word came
down from the signal bridge that the bear
had sent a rush message to the flagship a
half hour before stating that the rolling
lou had a man who was desirous of taking
mickey dovers place against alonzo cruz
and urgently recommending approval the
fleet athletic officer had replied
approved

  on top of that the flagship had signaled
the fleet that the fight would be held as
scheduled with a man from the rolling lou
substituting for dover the message of
which deac had read fragments through his
barred porthole in none of this com-
munication was the name of the man sub-
stituting given but it looked to the lous
tars as if deacon munden was the boy

  they were not kept long speculating
five minutes after ensign woodward and
deac had shoved off in the barge the boat-
swains mates were shouting

  now dyuh hear there all you men-
who are going-to the-e-fight-at fisher-
mans point tonight-between deacon
munden and alonzo cruz-muster at the
port gangway at seven forty-five uni-
form undress whites

  at this there went up from the rolling
lous decks such a roar as never before had
echoed among the mountains of guantana-
mo bay

theae that ensign wood-
ward said to deac as they dis-
embarked over on fishermans
point the cats out lad
but i cant fight sir deac reiterated
its against my principles

  now lad listen to common sense
those are fine principles but the point is
youre in a bad hole you heard what the
old man said-this mast reconvenes at
nine tomorrow morning if necessary by
if necessary he meant if you fail to trim
that cuban 

  they walked slowly up from the landing
toward a cluster of bungalows these the
dwellings of officers of the marine detach-
ment on the point

  principles ensign woodward went
on theres a bigger principle involved


adventure

youve a mother and father havent you
  the best in the world yes sir

  well you dont want to bring a lot of
worry on them do you it wont be an
easy matter for you to beat a general court-
martial on the charge of assaulting an officer
you might win out in the end again you
might not at best itll be a long-drawn-out
and weary process and take it from me
boy old bear blackstone will hand you a
general court tomorrow morning if you
dont get in there and fight tonight he
wanted to hand you one in the worst way
all that kept him from it was my springing
this gag on him

  but what made you i dont under-
stand yet sir

  well you know bear blackstone he
always has been a nut on fighters for
years hes been trying to land a fleet cham-
pion on his ship hed rather see one of
his men win a fight than be made a rear-
admiral and thats the spot in his nature
i played on

  but what chance have i got against a
fighter like cruz hes trained down to
the ounce i havent had the gloves on in
five years i wouldnt mind getting in
there and boxing trying to outpoint him if
i thought i had a chance

  say lad ive seen this cruz in action
down in santiago a month ago hes not
fast tough thats all hes got a hay-
maker but he sends you a postal telling you
when to expect it hang it lad- he
slapped deac on the back-i could lick
him myself and i couldnt stand up to you
for two minutes

  but im not trained mr woodward
this bout i hear is to go ten rounds thats
a long and heavy pull even on a man pre-
pared for it

  i know but it wont go ten rounds
  and ensign woodward chuckled

  what do you mean sir

  what could i mean youll flatten him
out long before the tenth round

  ill do nothing of the kind sir deac
shot back with heat and finality i said
id go in there and box try to outpoint
him

  but that means staying on your pins
for ten long rounds lad and youre not
trained

  i wont fight

  all right then box get in and do your
best conserve all you can take things

easy in the beginning dont let him get
to you watch your chances and bear
in mind if you win why the chances are
old bear blackstone will advance you to the
rating of chief yeoman tomorrow morning
and if i lose hell do all he can to send
me to prison deac finished for him a
fine pig to be wearing the uniform of a
naval officer he is he laughed and
they shot such men as abraham lincoln
he paused then sobering went on

  all right mr woodward i guess the
only thing for me to do is go in and try
ill do that ill do my best just to save my
own neck however not to please bear
blackstone as you say i dont want to
bring a lot of worry on my mother and
father furthermore ive got two years
pay on the books and you know what a
general court would do to that

  gobble it all up replied the officer
and send me to prison for say two
years making four years ill have worked
and fought for uncle sam for nothing

  and deac laughed again

  come to think of it mr woodward
he went on ironically this is some demo-
cratic navy weve got less than two years
ago sir we were out there on the wild
waves trying to make the world safe for
democracy as they put it fine sounding
word that democracy trouble is it doesnt
mean anything in the navy its all sound
and no sense why the laws and traditions
governing this navy sir belong back in
medieval times democracy

  deac probably would have kept on going
indefinitely for he was now pretty well
warmed up but just now ensign wood-
ward had halted before a well-lighted bun-
galow and was opening the gate laughing
carefree voices issued out

  come on munden said the ensign
this is lieutenant johnsons house ma-
rine officer im going to leave you here
while i run out to the flagship and make ar-
rangements with the fleet athletic officer
i want to get all the dope also scare up a
few seconds and some fighting togs for you
they stamped up onto the front porch
and entered the large living room unan-
nounced a game of cards was here in
progress between four officers two naval
and two marine

  hello woody they greeted in chorus
you fellows going to the fighc was the
way woody opened the conversation
the corruption of deacon munden



  fight why its off one replied

  was you mean its on again said
woody you fellows are asleep over
here by the way see if you can make this
lad happy for an hour or so will you while i
run out to the flagship ill be back

  sure but wait woody whos tak-
ing dovers place

  woody about-faced in the doorway and
pointed to deac

  the fastest boy in the fleet he said
deacon munden take care of him
ill be back and dont forget hes my
find

  with that woody went

  deacon said one of the marine officers
captain johnson you sit yourself down in
that easy chair if theres anything you
want sing out

from eight oclock on fisher-
mans point looked like a bril-
liantly lighted ant-hill came an
endless procession of boats and
strings of boats disembarking load after
load of white-clad gobs also there were
civilian boats conveying cuban sportsmen
mostly from guantanamo city and san-
tiago

  at eight forty-five oclock there were
twenty-five thousand fight fanatics on the
point and more still coming all made
for the baseball field where thousands of
lights the moon like a big white bulls-eye
helping spread daylight over the ring which
had been erected at second base

  there being only a few hundred seats
about the ring for officers the gobs and
civilians squatted on the grass

  it was a happy mob the cubans were
happy in the assurance of having doubled
their dollars their terrible cruz would
make quick work of this american sailor
this unknown substitute would have no
chance even thegreat dover would have
been no match for the terrible cruz the
gobs too were happy they were disap-
pointed of course that their idol mickey
dover was unable to fight but they were
happy just the same theyd see a fight
that was the big idea of course their
money was lost the bets couldnt be official-
ly declared off for the reason that officially
there wasnt supposed to be any betting
but what mattered the loss of a few dollars
money was good for spending and spending
only

  the flagships band was doing the honors
they opened with a time-honored number
good-by mr greenback a short fat
tar with a silver-tone tenor voice climbed
into the ring and took up the chorus that
is he began but he had sung not more
than three words when a shower of white
hats buried him

  the referee an officer from one of the
destroyers stepped in the ring and signaled
for silence the cornet players helped him
by sounding attention he merely an-
nounced what all hands already knew that
mickey dover had injured his shoulder and
so forth

  as he was finishing alonzo cruz fol-
lowed by his retinue climbed through the
ropes and sat down in his corner deacon
munden came a moment later accompanied
by ensign woodward another officer and
two gobs both fighters well known in the
fleet

  the mob gave cruz a tremendous ovation
when the referee introduced him and
with the whites of his rolling black eyes and
his grinning white teeth the dusky-skinned
cuban showed that he liked it slipping
off his purple bathrobe cruz bowed and
bowed he was a short powerfully-made
youngster with a broad sweep of shoulders
long muscular arms a slim supple body
and stocky legs nature had made him for
a fighter every inch of him suggested the
sinewy strength and lithe agility of a tiger
and if appearances counted for anything
he had that other requisite-confidence a
world of it

  the referee then introduced deac

  the fighting deacon of the rolling lout
he shouted

  another thunderous roaring and hand-
clapping but it broke sharply the instant
deac took off his bathrobe there was
dead silence as the gaping gobs took in
his slim white-skinned make-up he ap-
peared to have about as much chance
against the cuban fighter as a clean-limbed
thoroughbred horse would against a hungry
jaguar the mob sighed-

  oo-oo-oo

  stage fright took hold of deacs knees
the mass of faces rocked and swirled around
him faces faces everywhere-white yel-
low brown black smooth mustached
goateed bearded ripplings of laughter
floated up in a vague blurred way deac
could make out


adventure

  thats the fellow with the weak ribs
whats the joke anyway puttin that
bird in

  why dont they give us a run for our
money

  lots o brains puttin a child like that
against that gorilla

  its murder

  then suddenly there rose above the con-
fusion of mutterings and babblings and
yammerings a stentorian guffaw that caused
deac to look quickly to his left and down-
ward sure enough there he was down at
the ringside-the bear convulsively shak-
ing over some joke or other the while gog-
gling owl-eyed up at him beside him sat
carbolic his thin fox-like face twisted into
a forced grin and in the next instant dac
saw catfoots ugly visage back in the mob
a ways	

  deac set his teeth and tensed his knees
and walked to his corner

  they were waiting for the gong the
mob was silent necks were stretching eyes
straining the referee stood near the center
of the ring the seconds of both fighters
were leaving through the ropes all but en-
sign woodward who tarried at deacs side
to speak a few final words of advice

  just keep your head now lad he cau-
tioned take it easy dont let him get
to you remember youve got a whole lot
to win forget bear blackstone youre
not fighting this fight to please him the
old admiral has his eye on you boy i had
a little chat with him after leaving you a
while ago win this fight boy and youve
a royal chance of making paymaster
straight more than that think of what
the boys of the fleet  dig up for you if you
win them this fight mickey-dover told
me this evening that hed figured this fight
to net him three thousand dollars

  the mob began to bark

  lets go

  still woody tarried at deacs side

  get your eye on your man now mun-
den he continued look him straight
in the eye keep looking right at him as
you wade in that jaw lad lamp it study
it hold it its yours that jaw keep
your eye on it

  it flashed to deac in that moment
woodys game but he awoke to it too

late simultaneous with the clang of the
gong woody grabbed hold of deac at the
ribs and at the same time pushed him
across the ring toward the advancing
cuban

  deac shot out of his corner and came
down spinning in the center of the ring
when he stopped whirling he was facing
the referee that officer knew red when he
saw it he backed away deac followed
him at such speed that mr referee took to
his heels and ran and how he did run
around that ring like a man fleeing from

the- and deac hot after him round

and round they galloped faster and faster

  and what a wild and unearthly screech
the mob now turned loose the mountains
towering against the star-dotted sky must
have trembled the fishes in the bay must
have all scudded seaward it was ear-
splitting thanks be however it lasted
only a few moments it broke as abruptly
as it had burst forth silence again

  deac had knocked off chasing the referee
and was now facing cruz facing him
he was rushing him the mob gasped
such a shower of gloves as deac threw into
that cubans face and body

  zip zap zip zap zip zap

  oo-oo-oo-oo-oo moaned the mob

  and alonzo cruz ah the terrible
one knew not what to make of it all he
could see was gloves flying gloves it was
raining gloves

  zip zap zip zap he got it right and left on
the snout in the eyes ribs breadbasket
he retreated and tried to cover up but
deac had too many arms there was no
escaping his whirlwind of hooks jabs and
uppercuts seemed to cruz he was fighting
a dozen deacs

  woof grunted the mob as cruz stag-
gered backward across the ring from the im-
pact of one the deacon had planted almost
on the button then

  get im deacon get im get im
get im they clamored hilariously

  but the deacon needed no coaching now
he followed his man right up just before
the staggering cruz backed into the ropes
for the third time in that day deacs right
fist cut the air in an overhead arc

  and for the third time in that day he
planted it-on the button

  silence outside the ghostly rustling

leaves the thrilling of innumerable insects
shrilling of tree-frogs the mournful whis-
tling of night-jars traditionally sadly calling
upon some one to whip-poor-will and
from a building across the railroad track a

nasal whining

  dan leslie recoiled from the glaring eyes

with low-hanging hands flaming eyes and
slavering lips drawn back from huge teeth
and grappled with it

  ah is gottchu petuh yo time hab

him in a bone-cracking hug leslie twisted
and squirmed and burying his head in the
bush of hair pushed outward with all his
strength

  dan leslie relaxed his futile straining
suddenly and butted

  gerr-rump

  thump-and he was rolling on the floor
of the porch straining every muscle to get
on top of the thing that held him and hold
it down an acrid animal stench filled
his nostrils and sweat blinded his eyes

  bang his head hit the wall with a
force that jarred him to his heels a flash of
glaring light shot through his brain and he
went limp

  ee-ee-yhowh dan im in hell an
burning up come get me out

  yo is mah meat an ise guinna eat yo
alive slobbered the thing holding leslie
helpless against the wall and clamping down
on his thumb ground it between his teeth

  oo-oo-wee howled dan revived by
the pain and finding a thick ear against
his ups he bit on it and chewed

  ger-r-rowh growled the thing and
released the thumb

oo-oo oo-oo-ahblew the engine very

the wall and heaved over and over the
bodies roued and off of the edge of the porch

  whang whang-whang-whang rang a re-

ning up the steps when the strugghng
bodies bumped down one leaped back-
ward into the yard shooting as he sprang
two were knocked sprawung and rolled
out on the grass

  hey quit that an hul-lup me str-

with the gun one rolled over on to his
hands and feet and catapulted himself
head foremost into the mass the other
sprang up into the air from a squat and
landed with his feet on top

  sep-parelosi screeched the man hop-
ping around on the edge of the tumbling
mix-up looking for an opening to bring
down his gun on a head

  oooo-ooo-oo-oo bellowed the engine
rounding the curve

  a shaft of white light lighting up the
house and yard in a blinding glare hung
for a second on the struggle on the ground
and swung off bringing out the heavy mats
of bananas in bold relief as if painted on a
black background the staccato puffing
of the exhaust shut off short and with hiss-
ing steam and grinding brakes the engine
slid past and bumped to a clanking stop
a white man and a black man dropped off
and came running into the yard the white
man carried a revolver and a flashlight the
black man swung a heavy wrench

  what tha blue blazes-

  cruneh-whangl the jig-dancers gun ex-
ploded once and flew from his outflung
hand as he sank into himself under the force
of the blow on his skull and slumped to the
ground

 lawd me god-suh-

  crack the wrench fell and one body
rolled loose from the mess and subsided

 who tha-

  two heavy boots drove into the body of
another bringing forth a deep gasping
grunt and that one rolled out on the grass
and lay twitching and groaning

  the white man flashed on his light and
stooped over the remaining pair poised to
strike and the black man drew back his
wrench for another blow dan leslie
showed up on top of a heaving grunting
black body with madly glaring eyes and
foaming lips his legs wrapped around its
middle squeezing it between his knees his
elbows driven into its ribs under the arm-
pits and squeezing with all his power his
hand gripping a pair of lobeless ears and
thumping its head against the hard ground
with all his might

 the thing underneath kicked and
strained with its feet arching and twisting
its body and thumping its knees harmlessly
into leslies back its hands clawing at
leslies hands neck and face which were
buried in the thick mass of the things
wiry whiskers the white man and the
black man stepped around together from
opposite sides of the struggling bodies and

 crunch crack the revolver and wrench came
 down together the black body under-
 neath arched up on head and heels and
 leslie rolled off

 it twitched and quivered a time or two
 and then lay still breathing in great whis-
 tling gasps leslie rolled over once and
 lay on his back flopping and panting open-
 ing and shutting his mouth swallowing air
 in gulps like a fish out of water

 looked dazedly around the two natified

the borgias

by f r

i	f all the names in the vast

  n rogues gallery of history none
shines with such sinister efful-
 gence as that of borgia the
characteristic of the borgias-alexander vi
caesare and lucrezia-which has made the
greatest appeal to the popular imagination
is their ability as plotters and poisoners
they are credited with the most complex
stratagems and with innumerable murders
committed with a most artistic subtlety and
variety of method the usual impression
is that an endless procession of cardinals
dukes and princes dined with drank the
health of or accepted rings from the fatal
family and died weeks later without visible
symptoms of foul play the legend is so
terrible that it seems almost a pity it is
not true

  however the facts are that lucrezia
supposedly the blackest figure of the three
was really nothing more than a rather im-
moral and certainly very stupid woman
with no provable criminal record at all
csesare her brother was simply a mediocre
freelance soldier raised to dukedoms by the
power of his patron the pope his out-
standing murders-those of his brother his
brother-in-law and astore manfredi-were
rough vulgar affairs of cold steel in the
hands of servants

  alexander vi seems to have been the
only poisoner in the family and the poison
he chiefly affected when diagnosed in the

buckley

light of contemporary accounts of the deaths
of his victims is a disappointment merely
an arsenious solution comparable to modern
rat-poison

  there is no authentic support for the
fable about his presentation of rings with
small sharp fangs on the inside which
scratched the victim and caused lingering
death there is in any case no poison suit-
able for administration in just this way ex-
cept curare which is even today exceedingly
difficult to obtain and which was then
unknown

  the only really picturesque mode of as-
sassination in vogue anywhere near the
period in fact is one mentioned by ben-
venuto cellini poisoning by the administra-
tion of powdered diamond crushed glass
as is now well known does not deserve the
reputation it once enjoyed nor according
to cellini do other crushed jewels produce
the genuine diamond effect their fractures
being comparatively blunt and their ma-
terial soft the diamond however powders
into innumerable needles with points of ex-
treme fineness which do not blunt and
which gradually penetrate the walls of the
stomach

  so	it seems that the long-derided story
about lingering deaths from one dose of
borgia poison may have a foundation in
fact alexander had plenty of foes to whom
he wished all the agony possible-and plenty
of diamonds

        hugtfhtndifiter

    author of the homesteader thebush lopersetc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

trank ellis woke up one bright morning in

   california gulch to find himself a total failure
through the winter of  he had trailed from one
holding to another until the gold mining season was
at a close he was penniless and he had a sister
back east who believed him a great success there
was nothing left for him to do but take a job over
the lunch counter of the great western hotel
under the hand of george skillings boss

  as he was serving his first meal to a group of
miners -traders and mine employees he uncon-
sciously burst into a plaintive song

  stop that-racket the boss roared

  from that time on he was the singing pil-
grim

  the pilgrim became a drawing card nate goss
the gambler rabbit the indian doomed to dfeatfy
by his tribe on a charge of killing a brother tribes-
man ancient days an old-time placer miner
bones a man with a delusion of great prehistoric
beasts in the gulches-all fell into the lure of the
pilgrims voice

  whip king reputed to be the best wagon-train
boss between the river and the coast arrived in the
gulch with a startling crack of his monstrous whip
he had no special destination no special enemies
and he cared little for firearms but he proved to
be the friend of many restless men who fought
constantly many was the time that his long lash
sent men armed with six-shooters cowering in the
comer

  with the season almost ended and too many men
finding almost no gold things in california gulch
became a bit thick goss had a fight with charlie
dodge the monte gambler as a result of unfair
play and finally the pilgrim fought with his boss
the fight itself was inconsequential but a threat
loomed in the background when the pilgrim swore
vengeance

  that night skillings the boss was found with a
knife in his heart and the singing pilgrim was
missing from california gulch

   pardscopyright  by hugh pendexter

  examination of skillings effects brought to
  light counterfeit mqney amounting to twenty
  thousand dollars the mob almost in a frenzy
  shouted-

    hang the pilgrim hang the singing pilgrim

    and added to this they accused goss of being
  implicated in the counterfeiting gang giving him a
  chance of leaving town immediately or risking the
  circumstances if he stayed he left

    with the aid of rabbit the pilgrim stole away
  in the night an innocent outcast for many days
  they wandered until the pilgrim lost the rabbit
  when pursued by the utes the tribe of indians to
  which the rabbit belonged certain death threat-
  ened the pilgrim he was saved miraculously by
  the reappearance of rabbit whom the tribe worship
  as a god calling him the walking dead man

    an outcast by the name of lomson who has
  affiliated himself with the tribe also came into the
  camp trouble began anew by mistake the pil-
  grim and lomson went into the sacred medicine
  tent to smoke a pipe of tobacco out of the rain
  the indians found them there and in his excitement
  the pilgrim put a small idol in his pocket which he
  had in his hand at the time of the indians en-
  trance

     the discovery of the loss of the idol put thecamp
  in a turmoil the pilgrim was again accused and
  threatened with death court was held and rabbit
  promised that the idol would be restored with the
  release of the pilgrim he was unsuccessful and
  only through great stealth and cunning did the
  pilgrim finally escape from the camp of his enemies

  jdut his escape only threw him into more violent
  hands exhausted from travel and want of
  food the pilgrim came to the cabin of jonathan
  leaper an outlaw who offered to keep him over
  night bill waggle also spending the night there
  recognized the pilgrim and was turned out

     the reason for this came to light the next morning
  when leaper robbed the pilgrim bound him to a




adventure

mule and turned them both loose on the wild rocky
passes

  after a long period of intense suffering the pil-
grim was rescued by united states marshal farn-
ham and together they went back to the cabin and
captured leaper

  during this time goss arrived in denver where
he met whip king waggle

  before the pilgrim reached the city his sister
annie arrived from the east unexpectedly when
the pilgrim arrived he was sought out by goss who
made all arrangements for sister and brother to get
out of town before the pilgrim should be discovered

chapter viii

down the river road

own a hog-back where the up-
turned sandstone had resisted
erosion goss rode to canon city
the town appeared to be practical
ly deserted as the gambler entered and dis-
mounted in front of halls place the
proprietor was cleaning out the saloon he
dropped the broom and warmly greeted
glad to see you alive mister do you
know i was afraid last night you was gun-
ning for those wild men up grape creek
yes sir and youve got so much stuff in-
side here youll need a mule to pack it along
ancient said last night youd bought the
ranch thats where youre going

  goss was displeased to learn ancient days
had told about selling the ranch he mut-
tered something about an old fool and ad-
mitted he was riding to the ranch hall
misunderstood him and insisted

  nothing foolish about buying it any
property along the river between here and
pueblo will double a mans money in a few
years that is if this war ever stops you
cant get your stuff down there without a
mule ill lend you one and have one of the
mexican boys pack it

  thats kind of you ill make it right
just fetch or send the mule back some-
time thatll make it right ill have the
stuff packed in no time

 hasty and ancient quit town or
sleeping off their drunk

  hall smiled reminiscently

  they did have a high old time and made
enough racket for a hundred returned
miners seemed like old times joe hasty
is still as a mouse till he gets waked up
ancient always makes the eagle scream
they put all the boys to bed and half an
hour ago they was wandering about the
streets trying to find somebody to drink

by the deputies whip king offered his ranch sev-
eral miles from the city and the pilgrim and his
sister were guided there

   goss following them strayed from the main trail
and came to de longes cabin where four men were
playing cards he was permitted to join in the
game and soon had most of the winnings en-
raged by defeat burt damon cheated and was ac-
cused by his pal snap damon stabbed snap
and started for goss who shot him through the
head goss collected the money he had won and
keeping himself covered from de longe and the
other men went out into the night

with one of the boys said a scar-faced
feller started to enter the north end of the
town where they was dancing around a
bonfire and shooting off guns but turned
back after taking one look

  goss felt relieved he had no wish to
meet delouge again two lives were suf-
ficient as a price for his nights winnings
hall was running on

  instead of sleeping off their liquor those
two old hellions are trying to wake up the
new assayer got a hen on i spose

  goss inquired the location of the assay-
ers office and learned it was in the second
story of the post office building where billy
gamble set up the first billiard table in
canon city he left his horse hitched in
front of the saloon on reaching the build-
ing he found gabriel bowen laboriously cut-
ting a pile of firewood while ancient days
and joe hasty sat at one side and watched
him

  you fellers ought to help with this job
seeing how youre interested in my ore
said bowen as he paused to wipe the sweat
from his face

  sell us a share in your worthless mine
and well share in the hard work replied
ancient days

  its your ore the fellers assaying
added hasty lazily aint our fault if he
refused to test it unless you cut the wood

  then if its my ore what are you two
hanging round for warmly demanded
bowen

  if its any good were going to dog you
and snuggle in as close to your discovery
claim as we can frankly informed hasty

  ancient days observing goss let out a
whoop and jumped to his feet and ran for-
ward eager to shake hands with the gambler

  you oughter stayed with us last night
he earnestly declared never was money
put to such good account every son was
biling but joen me held the fort
pards



  any of the six hundred left

  well some thought youd lit out
got some stuff to be sayed

  goss shook his head and explained-
wanted to see you and tell you not to
mention a word about my buying the
ranch

  ancient scratched his head and con-
fessed

  seems to be pretty well known in town
you oughter warned me at the go-in

  if you meet young ellis or his sister
youre not to mention it dont forget
with this belated warning goss would
have turned back to the saloon if not for the
sudden appearance of a disheveled head at
a second story window with the owner call-
ing down-

  how much of that woods left

  goss blinked in surprize on beholding
euclid euclid failed to recognize the
gambler bowen picked up the ax and
answered

  five minutes will finish it well nigh
hogged-out now

  very good in six minutes ill be ready
to report on your ore

  and the eccentric young man banged
down the window and disappeared from
view

  goss entered the building and mounted
to the second floor and entered the billiard
hall euclid with back to the door was
seated and had his heels resting on the table
he was smoking a big pipe and without
turning his head he called out

  no use snooping wont do at all the
wood must be finished to the last stick
the sound of the ax in the street told him
the chopping was being continued and he
dropped his feet to the floor and impatiently
swung about to face the intruder with a
cry of delight he jumped from the chair and
stretched out both hands

    - but im glad to see you goss
when did you arrive how long you going
to stay

  and he advanced and shook the gamblers
two hands warmly

  pulling out very soon probably shall
go to pueblo

  goss first thought was to mention ellis
and his sister but he changed his mind
euclid was a wanderer and might spread in-
formation widely if he heard men inquiring
about the singing pilgrim

  how long are you staying here

   just long enough to get a bread-and-
 butter stake waiting for the men to come
 in from the winter and hoping theyll have
 lots of work for me by the middle of this
 month well have our first snow in the hills
 that ought to drive them in im getting
 tired of assaying trouble is theres not
 enough surface mines not enough rain-
 fall little water means only a little wash
 a slight wash means few surface diggings
 we have only an inch of rain here while
 theyre having a foot in california ive
 been trying to perfect a rain-making device
 thatll drench down these mountains more
 thoroughly just one little nubbin of an
 obstacle stands between me and success

   i musnt keep you from your work just
 wanted to say howdy

   and the gambler glanced at the black
 specimens on the table

   oh thats finished long ago im to get
 three dollars and the wood worked up

   poor-- pays and works just to learn

 he hasnt found anything murmured goss

   euclid grinned broadly and picked up a
 piece of the ore and informed

   hes found a mine of argentiferous
 galena he cant melt it down and make
 it into bullets because its chuck full of
 silver i havent overcharged him

   thats good see you again soon if you
 stay on here i shant be down the valley
 long

   and with another shake of the hand goss
 turned to depart then he remembered
and offered-

   ill lend you a hundred if youre in cap
 as his hand reached for his pocket euclid
 smiled wryly and refused

   no more im working in a bit of a
 pinch but ill get clear soon theres the
 horse you bought for me im still owing
 for that sit down we havent talked
 any yet wait a minute

   he ran to the window and called down-
 dont come here till i give the word
 just at the critical point of my process
 closing the window he confided to goss
 this business is too slow another sea-
 son i shall quit assaying and try prospect-
 ing if i could get in touch with lomsom
 when hes away from his utes i might make
 a dicker with him to work some of his secret
 placers

  keep away from lomsom hes bad
 medicine warned goss

   euclid grinned cheerfully and reminded


adventure

 remember how those red-took on

because i smoked the wrong pipe makes
me laugh to think about it then you two

fellows had to ride their sacred ponies-

but ive waked up in the night to laugh
about it then came the storm listen it
would take several days to talk ourselves
out

some other time i must be going
he hastened down to the street as euclid
called from the window for bowen to come
and receive the report he halted joe

hasty and ancient days in the doorway and
held them while bowen hurried up the stairs

  this is stretching friendship goss
bawled ancient

  listen to me sternly commanded the
gambler not a word to the assayer or
anyone else about ellis being on the ranch
as to that ore the assayer told me its heavy
with silver

  -amighty exploded ancient

  and wresting himself free he ran nimbly
up the stairs after the weary bowen

  at the store goss found the mexican
finishing his job of packing the mule the
load all but concealed the animal from
sight mounting his horse he started down
the valley to rejoin his friends at the ranch

        annie ellis critically surveyed
the two rooms she had swept and
and scrubbed and then joined her
brother out of doors the wonder
of the day and the grandeur of the western
skyline caused her to forget worries her
first impression of the ranch had been its
restful quiet compared with denver and the
hurried flight south

  this miracle of a morning had confirmed
her belief that she was out of the world of
troubles but as her gaze wandered to her
brother busy at a pile of logs her method-
ical mind made a more careful inventory of

the situation and loneliness and hopeless-
ness assailed her as she was compelled to
admit that their roof was borrowed and that
the few furnishings brought from canon
city had been provided by a professional
gambler

  her brother ceased work and called to
her-

  nate ought to be here soon

  she slowly advanced to the logs and re-
plied-

  im thinking he ought not to be here at
au

  good land after all hes done for us
he cried staring at her reprovingly

  thats just it frank were indebted
to him too much already of course well
pay it back sometime

  but thats nothing to do with him not
being here at all

  we must pay back what we owe but as
to his living here one of us- she did
not wish to hurt her brothers feelings

  ellis impatiently reminded

  you dont like gambling annie  but
you dont want him here the one place
where he cant gamble

  oh i know hes been kind to us she
agreed yet it isnt for us to make him
over you know what folks back home
would say we werent brought up to think
highly of gamblers

  i think highly of this gambler stoutly
insisted ellis if he played cards and lost
his money wed call him a dupe but be-
cause he plays cards-well hes a gambler
at least hes a success and thats moren i
can say of myself

  theres no comparison frank she
began

  but he quickly cut in and almost
roughly

  see here annie that man saved my life
hes a better man than i am he stood by
me in california gulch when i was plumb
discouraged he helped to save me from
the utes if hes good enough to do that
he ought to be good enough to eat some of
the food his money has bought

  her face went white then crimson
thats true frank i wont say an-
other word but i cant help my feelings
no one can but try not to show them
too plainly annie

  he turned and stared up the road and
added-

  hell be coming any minute now
pards



   ill be very nice she promised smiling
with her lips

  but after she had listlessly entered the
house her young face was tragic with de-
spair

  goss arrived shortly before the noon
hour ellis welcoming shout told his sister
of the gamblers return several minutes
before he rode up to the ranch with the
heavily laden mule the girl hurried to the
door and greeted goss cordially and was
pained to discover she was resenting him
more in his role of benefactor than in his vo-
cation as a gambler shewas unsparingly
honest with herself and strongly condemned
this phase of pride even while unable to oust
it goss was quite transformed ellis had
never seen him wear such a merry counte-
nance

  ive fetched some seeds and a few odds
and ends maam goss explained his bear-
ing becoming a bit diffident youll have
planting weather by march you can get
some hens and a cow from one of your
neighbors

  march she repeated but the old
man who owns this place jve been worry-
ing about his coming and not liking to find
us here i feel very uneasy surely hell
want to come here before next march
goss buoyant confidence returned as he
heartily assured

  he wont come i saw him at canon
city and talked with him about your stay-
ing here hes tickled to death house
will go to rack and ruin if not occupied
hes planning a new prospecting trip and
you wont see him for many months if at
all then again hes under obligations to
frank your brother helped him up in the
mountains he never had any use for this
place wouldnt plant a turnip to keep
himself from starving hes a placer man
give me a hand with the pack frank
the two quickly relieved the mule of the
heavy load and goss filled his arms and ap-
proached the door explaining

  you can get more seeds when you find
just what you want to put in butters dol-
lar a pound eggs dollarn half a dozen
corns fetching ten cents a pound and
everything else in proportion if the
plains indians follow minnesotas example
and go on the rampage everything you can
raise will bring a big price

  a dollar and a half for eggs she ex-
claimed her thoughts darting back to

martinsville prices why a farm is the
real gold mine out here

  her brother quickly amended

a gold mine for the three of us if we
can get some stock and put in some crops
well have five-ounce diggings in no time
and its high time you settled down to
something steady nate

  goss flashed a glance at the girl and knew
she was not sharing her brothers enthu-
siasm he lightly told ellis

  it isnt my game frank ive planned
to go down to pueblo for a while dont
know how long i shall stay as long as i like
it

  ellis face became wobegone his sister
urged

  youd better turn farmer mr goss
you have as much right here as we have
you have every right here maam
along of what your brother did for the
owner ancient days im just one of those
fellows who drift by and says howdy
ancient never will plow land unless sure he
can turn up ounce nuggets id be out of
place on a ranch its a ranch after you
strike nebraska coming from the east ive
been told id disgrace you all by forget-
ting to call a collection of horses a band
and all cattle owned by you as a herd and
part of a herd as a bunch and id never
remember that sheep are always in flocks
probably take me several years to adjust
those names right

  youre trying to be funny grumbled
ellis i dont see why you should pull
out it would be so much more cheerful if
you stayed wed form a partnership we
have the use of the ranch because ancient
doesnt want it and because he feels in-
debted to me thats my share youve
brought in a big stake of grub thatll be
your share annie does the housework
thats her share

  well keep accounts and raise lots of
vegetables that leaves the money i owe
you to come out of my share well make
more than you can make at the tables
besides card playing for a living wont al-
ways be flush money in colorado youve
got to turn to something else sometime
why not now

  your brother talks like a preacher and a
bang-up lawyer maam goss laughingly
told the ellis girl im thinking his talk
will assay top-high at that

  i havent any doubt that some other


adventure

occupation would be better for you she
slowly replied

  and none better than farming urged
ellis

  of course none better than farming
she agreed

  its good of you to want to snatch me
from the burning even if i keep in the fire
goss gravely told them but my plans
are made and ill trot along to pueblo and
look the ground over send the mule back
to george hall in canon city by some of
your neighbors 

  i feel badly to have you pay for our
supplies the girl helplessly insisted

  its nothing that concerns you just a
matter between frank and me when
youre selling cabbages for several dollars
apiece and weighing out corn on gold scales
ill be rapping at the door with my hat in
my hand to ask for some cold victuals
now i must see to my horse

  laughing over his prophecy he deposited
his armful of packages inside the door and
hurried to picket his horse

  the noon meal was eaten with genuine
enjoyment by ellis and with false gaiety by
goss the girl found the gamblers pres-
ence a constant reminder of her dependence
on him even for food and the ellis family
were strangers to donations all her east-
ern prejudices were aroused yet person-
ally there was much about goss to admire
he was scarcely her senior and was very
boyish and genuine as he permitted free
play to his sense of humor he was gener-
ous he had been kind to her brother kind
to her

  she feared he suspected he was not
wanted and she endeavored her best to make
him feel welcome but she was the prod-
uct of generations of prim set ideas of
respectability and her mind was ever un-
willingly returning the verdict he was out-
side the pale the more she essayed to be
nice to him the more readily did his keen
mind perceive the truth behind her manner
in the terminology of his craft he quickly
concluded-

  shes over-playing her hand

  only his ability to dissemble covered up
his sense of loss

  ellis persisted in urging his friend to stay
goss laughingly ignored the invitation
ellis warmly repeated his warning that
gambling as a trade could lead to nothing
permanent when he appealed to his sister

on this point her acquiescence was prompt
and positive but used to reading inscru-
table men goss found her to be transparent
the inexorable fact remained she did not
relish his presence his pride was as great
as hers as was his capacity for being hurt
for like her he was young

immediately after dinner he
announced he must ride on the
girl demurred and her brother ex-
postulated goss laughingly con-
tinued his preparations ellis followed him
to his horse still insisting the gambler
sharply broke in on him with the inquiry-
still keep your hand-gun handy
hanging inside by the door but i shant
need it

  probably not but queer characters
drift up and down this road you keep
it loaded and handy this country is per-
fectly safe for a woman if she has a man to
protect her

  ill protect her grimly assured ellis
oh the chances are you two wont be
troubled at the most youll only have to
make a show of force if some bullv should
decide he could scare you off and jump this
place hed likely try it ill be riding up
later to see how youre getting along get
acquainted with your neighbors so long
maam i know you and your brother will
make this place blossom like the rose
fruit trees will do well here im told
annie left the doorway and joined them
her face serious and troubled she stood by
his stirrup and shook hands and said
everything is so mixed up mr goss
you ought not to be going away to gamble
you ought to earn some money in another
way and buy a place and settle down
frank and i ought to be making our own
way somewhere instead of living on bor-
rowed property im afraid my worries
have made me appear unmindful for what
youve done for frank and me but i do
mind it really i want you to know
that

  listen young lady goss told her
everything will be perfectly all right
you can remain here as long as you like
the owner wouldnt stay here if the place
was covered with hens all laying eggs of
purest gold youve had all your hard
luck its all behind you in the spring you
can arrange to buy this place for a small
price if you care to
pards



  i dont think i could live here we be-
long back east

  goss stared down at her thoughtfully
then offered

  if youre mortal keen to go back it can
be fixed you dont have to wait but
youll have to go by the platte route and
start mighty soon

  i wont go back to denver to catch a
wagon train bluntly spoke up ellis
theyll still be looking for me there

 we must keep away from denver
agreed the girl well get along here till
next spring anyway

  you mustnt give up too much on ac-
count of frank said goss it isnt your
fault if hes drawn a poor hand hes a
man he can shift for himself the most
important thing in the valley of the arkan-
sas is to see that youre outfitted right
well leave it this way if you have a sud-
den hankering to go he can get word to me
at pueblo and ill fix it maybe youll feel
easier in your mind maam by remember-
ing you can pull out any time for the river
its like being in a room with the door open
trouble comes when the door is closed and
locked on the outside

  well stay through the winter she said
youve done too much for us as it is
what i intended to say was to thank you
not to complain

  forget about it was his terse advice
your brother and i have had some rare
times together we owe lots to each you
just happened along you dont get any
cards youre just looking on i wont
quit pueblo without letting you know
send word if anything goes wrong

  with a nod and a smile he turned his
horse down the river road and as they
watched him gallop out of sight both felt
they were very much alone

  nates a good fellow ellis aggressively
declared even if he is a gambler hes a
good fellow one of the best

  of course dear and all the greater
pity he should be a gambler well never
forget hes been a good friend to both of us
now while im doing the dishes why not
burn the untidy pile of brush near the road
she hurried in doors to hide her home-
sickness ellis proceeded to light the brush
that represented ancient days only effort
to improve the ranch after he had built an-
other room on to the house as ellis was
moodily watching the crackling flames a

man rode up and slid from the saddle and

greeted

how are you young man im jesse
frazer one of your neighbors squatting

on ancients place i take it

  frazers manner was genial and his face
kindly and although only thirty years old
he impressed ellis as being much older and
one who could be confided in ellis ex-
plained much of his troubles omitting only
his fear of the law frazer listened and
nodded sympathetically but rather an-
noyed the young man by kicking the burn-
ing brush apart and stamping out the fire

  thats fine said frazer as the young
man finished his recital of hopes and prob-
lems i can outfit you with some hens and
tell you lots ive learned by experience yes
i can let you have a cow and by spring you
probably can arrange to pay for the critter
maybe i can let you have two so you can
make butter to sell im glad to find a
young man who knows growing gold in the
shape of crops is better than digging it

  caught a glimpse of the little woman
through the window she moves round
like she was a real worker colorado needs
workers besides those who dig holes in the
ground and paw over rocks after the
placer golds all been found and gambling
gets to be out of fashion this river country
will be a fruit country coal all the way to
pueblo gabriel bowen has found some
oil wells

  stock raising is beginning to grow
after the wars ended and the injuns sim-
mer down this will be a likely country
young men will be coming back from the war
keen to work fine lands for all between
the platte and the cache - a - la - poudre
above and below denver and all along the
arkansas think ill step in and speak to
the little woman

  ellis began heaping up the scattered
brush but frazer halted him saying

  dont think id burn that now some
arapahos and cheyennes a few miles down
stream stopped the settlers from burning
brush a few days ago they believed the
settlers were signaling to the utes let it
be till spring or till the injuns have cleared
out

  they entered the ranch-house and after
a few minutes the girl felt as if she had al-
ways known frazer he talked enthu-
siastically of his one place and insisted she
and her brother come over and visit for a


adventure

few days and bring back some hens and a
cow or two

  youll like my wife shes the first
white woman in this part of colorado
robert middletons wife was the first in
canon city and anson rudds child was
the first male child born in canon city
but i mustnt run on

  yet he did for more than an hour and
filled his eager listeners with courage and
ambition his rambling talk supplied what
they had lacked vision he appeared to
notice everything and on leaving asked
about the mule if it did not belong to hall
at canon city ellis explained and frazer
promptly offered to return the animal on
his next trip to town

  after he had departed annie burst into
tears and told her brother

  thank heaven hes human ive been
wanting to cry for a long time dont mind
me dear sign im feeling better think
of him and his wife coming down here and
making a home when denver was the near-
est place where he could get supplies and
his walking to canon city when he heard a
wagon train was there and paying eighteen
dollars for a sack of flour and bringing it
home on his shoulder he says hell soon
have a big orchard of two thousand trees
apples pears plums and all kinds of ber-
ries why frank hes even planning to
keep bees and two years ago he started in
with a crooked stick for a plow

  if he can do all that we at least can stick
it out till spring declared her brother we
felt all alone in the world and he popped in
and if here aint more neighbors

  he opened the door to greet the horseman
he had glimpsed through the window and
instead of one man beheld three his first
glance at the foremost rider told him they
were not farmers like goss he read reck-
lessness in the scarred face of delouge
the long black hair and heavy gun in the
belt proclaimed him anything except a tiller
of the soil

  delouge rode up to the door and shaking
his hair back removed his ragged slouch hat
and bowed low to the startled girl and in a
soft musical voice explained

  just riding around and looking for a
man who came down this way calls him-
self nathan goss square gambler were
keen to meet him

  seth and snap licked their lips and edged
their mounts forward to hear ellis reply

  ellis inwardly perturbed by the contrast
between the mans suave voice and savagery
of his black eyes was given no opportunity
to answer his sister standing at his
shoulder stepped forward delouge bare-
headed bowed again and began -

  i was asking your husband madame

  my brother i heard you ask for a man
called goss she broke in weve seen
nothing of the friend youre seeking

  a new acquaintance scarcely a friend
as yet miss murmured delouge if
mr goss should happen along this way id
take it kindly if youd mention to him that
delouge had inquired for him

  but look here capn called out
seth

  delouge turned and stared at his com-
panion who suddenly lost his voice and
backed his horse toward the road snap
followed his example delouge swept his
glance about the premises smiled slightly
as he looked down into the girls flushed face
then with another bow wheeled and rode
after his friends

  the three galloped down the river road
annie ellis clutched her brothers arm and
looked after them with a great dread in her
eyes

  frank she whispered theyre hunt-
ing him

  how do you know that he muttered
you told them he hadnt been here

  i lied because i knew they were hunting
him that horrible man with the pretty
voice such a deadly man how polite he
was to me but how quickly he would kill
and smile as he killed

  good- annie youre guessing at

this goss knows many men of many
types if i believed what youre saying id
be riding to get word to nate

  you would never catch up with them
if you did they wouldnt let you pass goss
is far on his way they cant find him till
they reach pueblo theres nothing we can
do oh if only folks out here were all
kindly and neighborly like mr frazer

  she abruptly darted into the house and
her brother knew she was shedding tears of
bitterness this time he believed she wished
to be alone he waited and at last she
came to the door her small face composed

  im all right now frank ive made
myself believe hell come to no harm

  but he had been thinking he insisted-
pards

i

  they couldnt know that goss had been
here

  the mule told them that much she
replied i saw the mans eyes light up
when he saw the mule they learned at
canon city he had started down this way
with a mule loaded with provisions theyre
hunting him

  her brother believed she had the right
of it he had forgotten about the mule
contentedly grazing near the house he
groaned-

  its awful not to be able to make a move
to help him

  im making myself believe hell come to
no harm from them

  of course he wont nate goss isnt the
man to be caught asleep he can shoot it
out with the best of them with the
three of them if he has any sort of a
show

  theres only one of them to be feared-
the one with scar the down his face hes
deadly she murmured he hates mr
goss they must have met and had trouble
he tracked your friend to canon city
learned about the mule and the supplies
they didnt meet him going back to town
they found the mule here they know he
went down the river god give him a
chance

  why see annie ellis eagerly broke in
you have the right of it and youve
proved scar-face isnt so deadly as you
think sure they have met and had
trouble but nate got clear and he aint
one to run from a fight if he bested them
once he can again you ought to have seen
him shoot it out with charley dodge in
california gulch

  shooting always violence what a
country she whispered

         the day passed slowly for the
two they retired early but not
to sleep each was listening for
the sound of galloping hoofs com-
ing up the river road and the murderous
crash of gun-fire at last ellis slipped from
his bed and crouched by the window re-
volver in hand delouge knew annie had
lied he might not be so courteous when he
came up the road

  a hand rested on his shoulder and with a
start he jerked his head about and beheld
the slim white-clad figure

  go back to bed frank she urged

they havent had time to make pueblo and
return

  if they find him there and get the worst
of it those who come out alive may call
again

  what i said cant help nor hurt them
she reminded when they saw the mule
they knew the truth i dont think de-
louge will think any the worse of us for
trying to help a friend im not worrying
about that he isnt that kind of a dead-
ly man im only concerned about mr
goss

  in the morning they kept watch of the
river road while pretending not to do so
and yet a horseman approached the house
and dismounted while they were eating
breakfast and they did not suspect his
presence until the door flew open greatly
startled by the unexpected and rather vio-
lent entrance of the newcomer they stared
dumbfounded for a moment then gradually
recovered some of their composure on dis-
covering he was not one of yesterdays trio

  the scrub-growth of beard could not con-
ceal the viciousness of the mans counte-
nance his clothes were of the mexican
mode and were liberally decorated with
buttons of silver he stared at them for a
bit then grunted

  counted on catching that rat of an an-
cient when i see the smoke from your
chimbly what you squatting in his house
for huh speak up sharp im in a
hurry

  ellis and his sister rose from the table
and the former asked-

  who are you

  the stranger scowled and significantly
replied-

  im vince moore probly youve heard
tell of me

neither had although moore was noto-
rious up and down the upper valley ellis
simply saw an intruder in him and said-
i dont admire your manners in knocking
a door open like that

  moores eyes widened showing much of
the whites then half closed as he shifted
his gaze to the pink cheeks of the girl
without glancing at ellis he directed

  you go outside ill talk to you after
ive talked to your woman mebbe your
ears are stuffed up and you didnt hear me
say that im vince moore

  ellis face went pale and he was swept
with the anger that had prompted him to


adventure

 promise death to skillings moore with a
 side glance believed it was fear he was
 seeing in the young mans strained features
 and he remarked

  mind seems to be waking up guess
 youve heard of vince moore after all
 annie hurriedly said

   the man you came to see isnt here
 hasnt been here will you please go

   i will not please go he answered trying
 to mimic her gentle voice

   ellis made an inarticulate sound and came
 around the table moore dropped a hand
 to his hip and half drew a gun and re-
 minded-

   im vince moore git

   go frank hoarsely begged the girl
 ellis stumbled toward the door moore
 threw back his head and laughed and with
 his wide-opened eyes stared at the fright-
 ened girl he saw her hand steal to take up
 a table-knife and his amusement was
 doubled then ellis was upon him leaping
 half across the room and throwing his arms
 about the belted waist with a furious
 oath moore struck his fist against the bowed
  head and attempted to reach his gun other
 blows showered on ellis head and face but
 he did not feel them he straightened up
 lifting his man clear of the floor kicking
 and clawing and striking moore found him-
 self being carried to the door then he
 centered all his efforts on attempting to get
 at ellis eyes

   with a scream of rage ellis swung him
 violently about and smashed his head
 against the logs they reeled over the
 threshold and fell to the ground moore
 was partly stunned and groped awkwardly
 fqr his gun with another scream ellis
 leaped upon him feet first and kicked and
 beat him insensible without hearing his
 sisters frantic cries for him to secure the
 revolver and it was she who darted in and
 emptied the gaily embroidered holster

   ellis still mouthing terrible threats
 picked up the inert figure as if it had been a
 bag of meal and carried it to the road and
 threw it down a bloody dirt-covered
 bundle of spoiled finery and bruised flesh
 then he stood erect and gasped-

  there-you how does that suit

 but moore remained motionless annie
 ran up with the captured revolver in both
 hands sobbing loudly she kept repeating
 so brave of you frank oh that was so
 good

  ellis the mock of ill fortune had dis-
covered himself his shoulders went back
and there was exultation in his soul as he
realized that never again would he be de-
pendent on another for protection against
violence there was blood on his face and
blood on his hands where moores fingers
had dug into the flesh

  one eye was commencing to swell and he
could feel a lump on his jaw and his lips
were puffed but he gloried in his
hurts

  after panting for breath a bit he patted
his sisters shoulder and told her-

  annie weve done taking back-talk from
any rotten scum out here

  he reached out a foot and ungently
stirred the prostrate man moore groaned
and worked himself to a sitting posture and
stared stupidly at his conquerer

you well nigh killed me he whispered
get up you dog commanded ellis
he seized him by the shoulder and ripped
the gay mexican jacket beyond repair as he
jerked him to his feet

  theres your nag mount and ride for
it im keeping your gun as you dont seem
to know how to use it if any one thinks
you look queer tell them you tackled the
wrong man

  and forthwith he booted the man to his
horse each kick eliciting a howl

  once in the saddle moore used his spurs
and galloped down the road and never once
looked back

  with a gesture of disgust annie passed
over the revolver but there was no home-
sickness nor sorrow in her face as she tear-
fully praised

  oh im so proud of you frank im be-
ginning to think that sometimes the only
way to meet violence is to use violence

  i can lick the whole-rotten scum

he boasted between his swollen lips

  hush dear youre wonderful but you
mustnt swear now come in and let me
wash your poor face

  and iu hand over the same kind of
medicine to that scar-faced feller if he comes
nosing round here again he added as he
stalked proudly by her side to the house
this speech brought fear back to her
no no she softly restrained the
man who calls himself delouge is deadly
more so than a dozen of the beasts you
whipped but he wont bring you any
trouble he isnt bad in the way that
pards



beast is a woman or a child would never
need feel afraid of him

  hes bad enough to kill nate goss if he
can mumbled ellis

  yes hell do that and i pray they
wont meet but he wont kill from be-
hind he wont ever look at a woman the
way that beast did

  i wish id twisted his head off re-
gretted ellis

  she bathed his face and mothered him
with caresses he accepted it all as being
the due of a warrior then he confessed
annie before that row i was afraid of
lots of things i was afraid of charley
dodge the man goss drove from the gulch
now ive learned something i dont
have to stand for any abuse unless i want
to mr frazer never stood for any abuse
ill bet on that and annie this country
looks lots better to me than it did just be-
fore breakfast - i handled that feller

like he was a rag doll   he laughed boister-
ously take their guns and knives from
them and i can lick a dozen of them at
least i got that much out of swinging a
pick and lifting boulders

  she glanced at moores gun and shud-
dered that was the trouble with rats
they had no liking for a mans fight

pueblo wakes up

tueblo at the mouth of fontaine qui
bouille where the old santa fe trail to
the laramie plains crossed the arkansas
was laid out by buell and boyd of denver in
the winter of  and i the sur-
veyors plotted the streets wide and straight
and not being skimped for territory made
the town a likely one on paper there
was ample room on the plot sheet even for
a large municipal park near the mouth of
dry creek and the map represented it to
be filled with tropical flowers and rare
shrubs with many fountains graciously
sprinkling the earth and tending to cause
the greenhorn to forget the alkali dust on
his ankles

  but despite its over-night growth on
paper pueblo was a substantial little settle-
ment and had a historical background years
before gold was discovered in colorado
there were the ruins of an adobe fort and
its fence of cottonwood pickets a reminder

  of the  massacre when on christmas
day the utes killed seventeen of the gar-
rison some of these victims were pursued
far out on the plains where their bones were
found by immigrants during the first gold
rush to the pikes peak region

  prior to this the first american families
in colorado wintered at pueblo from sep-
tember  to the summer of  these
men and women with their children were a
part of the mormon battalion expelled
from illinois with bayonets they had ac-
cepted service with the government so they
might have their families safeguarded to
utah

  those wintering at pueblo were sent from
the crossing of the arkansas and from santa
fe they built houses children were born
and died and the survivors rejoined the
mormon migration to the great salt lake
in  there was a world of misery and
tragedy in that winter and yet it was only
an incident in the towns history

  james beckwourth mulatto chief of the
crows claimed to have made the first settle-
ment at the mouth of the fontaine in 
in that year several mountain men mostly
americans were living there married to
mexican women and carrying on a trade
with the indians fremont saw this little
isolated community in 

  major long was there in  lieu-
tenant pike camped there in november
 and designated the spot as the forks
it was near the site of pueblo that the bent
brothers built a stockade before building
bents fort farther down the arkansas to
be in closer touch with the united states
and taos trade on the mountain branch of
the sante fe trail many cheyennes
moved down to the river after william bent
married one of their women

  nathan goss was paying his first visit to
the town and he was disappointed there
were no buildings close to the river and with
the exception of pat maywoods blacksmith
shop on the bank the houses were back from
the bottom the gambler engaged lodgings
at uncle tommy suttles hotel a one-story
building of logs and situated on santa fe
avenue having put up his horse and left
his scanty luggage he walked about the town
to estimate its possibilities in games of
chance

  a sign announcing that-roaring bill

 from bitter creek held forth in one cabin
 aroused his interest but on entering he


adventure

 discovered it was a small eating room and
 that the proprietor was a man of mild
 manners and much inclined to sleep in
 his waking moments he must have been
 something of a wag as over the short
 counter was a crudely printed sign that
 read-

    cold cuts  pickld eels feet  bits

    jack allens drinking and gaming saloon
 was more promising several mexicans
 were lounging at the bar descendants of the
 original holders of all the country south of
 the arkansas they were consuming taos
 lightning and listening to a shocked-headed
 and drunken american boast that he would
 kill an indian before he was a day older

    allen scrutinized goss sharply as the lat-
 ter took his place by the boaster and ordered
 a glass of beer

    gambler laconically queried the pro-
 prietor	

   i play cards sometimes if thats what
 you mean goss replied

    well outfitted

   both guns and cash

   you dont need any guns this is a
 decent town

   now you just wait a minute jack
 gravely broke in the drunken man

   shut up bowker snapped allen
 youre drunk

 then to goss he explained

 games start about eight oclock they
 keep running as long as the money lasts
 town seems to be empty remarked
 goss

 dont you believe it mister warmly
 cried allen see it at night and youll
 swear its denver on its hind legs and
 hooting

 sounds hopeful if theres a poker game
 worth while i might be interested

 i know just the kind of an outfit youre
 hunting for black bill a mexican

 i prefer americans understand them
 better informed goss hastily

 oh youll understand bill a child can
 understand him fair to middling player
 and always well heeled with cash

 miner trader freighter rapidly
 asked goss

 why sort of a general business allen
 began

 but the drunken man laughed loudly and
 jeered

 general business the kind that takes

 lots of hoss-flesh to carry it on eh jack
 and a stage coach or two and a cache of
 gold dust

  will you shut up you poor-fool

hissed allen youre talking yourself to
death

  the man cast a frightened glance at the
swarthy profiles along the bar and held his
tongue allen amiably resumed for the
gamblers benefit

  we have some of the nicest bank games
you can find anywhere mister theyre
simon-pure on the square

   they always are heartily agreed goss
maybe ill look in later he was making
for the door when the drunken man bawled
after him

  i can show you the best game of all
stranger just you trail after me and see
me pot an injun

   bowker you git to bed or youll never
git another drink in this place roared
allen

   for the first time in his wanderings goss
felt lonesome the sensation was irritating
because it was new he felt out of sorts and
out of place as he wandered down the street
and he wished himself nearer the mountains
he dropped into john thatchers small log
cabin store on second street between santa
fe and main to replace a gun he had given
to young ellis he selected a thirty-one
caliber colt its six-inch barrel making for
precision well balanced as well as ac-
curate

   doesnt seem to be much going on here
he remarked to the merchant

   thatcher on the road to honors and riches
from small beginnings quickly inventoried
his customer and replied

   all depends on what one is looking for
were a trade center for a considerable
stretch of the valley trade comes down
the fontaine and up from the st charles
but folks dont make a lot of noise in grow-
ing crops and selling supplies theres more
bustle and excitement over one stage rob-
bery than youll find in planting a big
orchard such as frazer plans to put in up
near canon city from one point of view
theres lots going on in missouri but its
guerrilla warfare and doesnt lead to any-
thing permanent

  im not hankering for gun play or id
bought a colts navy model but this town
seems empty many come down this far
from the mines to spend the winter
pards



  some canon city and denver get the
bulk of them

   thatcher was called away to wait on an-
 other customer a swarthy-faced man with
 the cheek bones of an indian he wore
 much mexican finery but had a red cloth
 tied around his black hair in place of a hat
 he walked by thatcher without heeding his
 greeting and came to where goss was stand-
 ing and pointed to a remington forty-four
 handgun solid frame and tersely asked-
 how much

   being told the price he paid from a hand-
 ful of gold and departed thatcher looked
 after him and remarked i would have
 preferred not to have sold him that revolver
 but he knows guns and he smells excite-
 ment as it makes two he will be carrying
 breed

  his father was john smith government
interpreter mother a cheyenne his white
name is jack smith white men wont
accept him as one of them and he trails with
the indians hes more bitter against the
whites than if he was a full-blood

        goss wandered back to uncle
tommys log house and played
 solitaire in a corner and tried to
 work out of his depression he
had rejoiced in escaping from the mountains
now the snow-covered peaks were kindly
reminiscent undoubtedly he would have
been more contented in denver that was
the place for a man of mettle there were
many gaming places in denver and many
men who felt lucky he would have sad-
dled his horse forthwith and started up the
valley if the road had not led by the ranch
once owned by ancient days he smiled
grimly at a new thought and told himself
thatcher would have a better opinion
of me if id told him i owned land down this
way but canon city is feverish alongside
of this place

  that night he remained in his lodgings
and experienced the novelty of retiring
early that he must have slept soundly
was proven when uncle tommy in the
morning garrulously greeted

  did you hear popping last night -

but such doings parcel of the boys rode
down the river to bust up a meeting of the
knights of the golden circle lost their
courage or something or else there wasnt

	any meeting got filled with taos and
come back here looking for trouble got to

 letting off guns in allens place i thought
 at first that men from texas had come to
 capture the territory

  dear me sighed goss as he sat down
to his breakfast some one nearly struck
some one else in anger

  oh it didnt git to real trouble sheriff
hank way come along and told them to
quit or theyd have a fuss with him they
quit

  this bit of gossip helped goss to form a
entirely false estimate of the town it not
only lacked life but it lacked guts the
would-be reckless were satisfied with making
believe to be bad men he held it in
contempt

  as a fact many desperate characters
drifted into pueblo from sante fe and taos
from missouri and texas-silent deadly
men who made no more noise than a man
planting corn some passed up the valley
to canon city some to colorado city at the
base of pikes peak some to denver in
the summer season they unobtrusively pene-
trated to the gold camps and all ultimate-
ly returned if not killed in their venturing
back to pueblo and south or across the
plains to the river

  there was no harm in the blustering
group that rode down the valley in search
of southern sympathizers but those quiet
tight-lipped men who linked up denver
and the boom camps to new mexico with
a chain of crime had great capacity for
evil

  the mexican man who drew aside to give
goss the door when the gambler took to the
street would kill as readily as he would
swallow a glass of taos lightning did murder
promise him the slightest gain or con-
venience the undersized american born
in illinois slight of figure and inoffensive
of face who bowed courteously on recog-
nizing the gamblers calling carried two
guns under his black frockcoat and had
earned the notches on each

  near noon that day there was a ripple of
excitement when word was passed that ruel
bowker had made good his boast of the
evening before by murdering an arapaho
indian two miles down the river goss
arrived in front of aaron simms house
shortly after bowker came in to receive the
praise of his saloon friends he was proudly
exhibiting a bow and a quiver of arrows
taken from the dead man a crowd quickly
collected bowker feeling the elation of a


adventure

hero waved an allen  thurber pepper-
box thirty-one caliber and loudly pro-
claimed 

  heres the medicine i done it with i
can kill a whole tribe

  jack smith the mixed-blood rode up
from the east and leaped from his horse and
would have shot bowker out of the saddle
had not a citizen seized his arm several
other men joined in restraining smith
murderous looks and loud threats were cast
at him

  bowker renewed his blustering when he
beheld smith helpless allen a bradford
soon to be appointed to the supreme court
bench of the territory released his grip on
smiths arm and demanded what do you
know about this did you see it happen
restrained from taking summary ven-
geance smith sullenly explained

  i found the arapaho man dying a
speck far up the road was his killer the
arapaho man told me the white man was
drunk and began shooting without saying
a word

  a trader shook his fist at bowker and
denounced

  its fools like you that fetch us trouble
the arapahos are friendly you killed
without any reason

  the taos in him did the killing added
another

  bowker did right all injuns oughter

be shot to- yelled one of the assassins

drinking companions hooray for old
ruel

  that kind of talk doesnt do this town
any good sternly rebuked bradford by
this mans own tell hes committed murder
from pure wantonness we cant pass it
over

  hold court right here cried the trader
you hear the evidence bradford

  this suggestion was warmly endorsed by
the law-and-order element bradford urged
lets go to the back room of boones
store and find out just what happened
lets not be hasty in our procedure well
hold an inquest as to just how the indian
came to his death

  you folks act peeved began bowker
taken back by the suggestion his act was
not worthy of unrestrained praise

  bowker you keep shet broke in one of
his friends if a fuss is going to be made
about this matter well let tother side
furnish the proof and we aint taking any

half-breeds word as to what any dying
injun told him

  the gathering promptly adjourned to
colonel boones store on lower santa fe
street and borrowed the use of the back
room from dr catterson the manager
hank way was sent for to take charge of
the prisoner and to see that smith remained
peaceful the sympathy of many was with
the accused and bowker believing himself
safe refused to heed all admonitions and
with drunken gravity boasted he had fired
the fatal shot at a distance of seventy-five
to a hundred yards this statement aroused
considerable laughter as there was no
other witness to the homicide smith was
called on to testify and eager to convict
bowker repeated the victims ante-mortem
statement and swore the arapaho told him
the white man began shooting the moment
he came in sight

  that pepper box wont carry that far
turn ruel loose some one insisted

  we aint got any jail that pepper box
wont kill at thirty yards except by acci-
dent cried another ruel was drunk and
just shooting promiscus if he hit the injun
it was a miracle

  a third man insisted all present serve as a
jury and called for a vote by a show of
hands even those who deplored the crime
knew bowker could not have shot with
precision even at twenty-five yards the
gathering grew tumultuous and the trader
who wanted bowker punished in great dis-
gust agreed

  all right let it be a show of hands
it was a brutal murder but the drunken
fool hit by pure luck

  hands hands all who say ruel
bowker is innocent hold up their hands
this was repeated in a chorus and brad-
ford said

  i resign youve taken the matter into
your own hands unfortunately the evi-
dence is one-sided as to the distance i
believe the man should be held for a formal
trial

  but this suggestion was cried down
hands were again called for and bowker
was overwhelmingly acquitted on leaving
the room goss fell in beside the trader who
had wanted justice done and remarked-
well the man goes free

  yes smith spoiled any chance to punish
him by saying the rapaho said bowker
began shooting the second he came in sight
pards



of course we know he was close to the in-
dian when he shot him within a few feet
but well have a jail soon and well get a
tight grip on this town im afraid well
hear from smith later

  they were to hear from him two years
later at sand creek where he was killed in
the fight with chivingtons men

  goss walked about the town to kill time
and then returned to his lodgings in front
of suttles place he encountered bradford
and spoke of the trial and remarked

  the whole business seems to be a mighty
raw deal plainsmen friends of mine say
the cheyennes and sioux are getting un-
easy and want to go the minnesota sioux
several better and will bring us a big fight
another season

  i fear so after this murder the arap-
ahos are bound to be more favorable for
a general war in trade

  no gambler

  im sorry not questioning the morality
of card playing but i cant see that it leads
to anything permanent simply a matter
of getting on and making the most of op-
portunities a man at forty should have
an assured income from business or one of
the professions

  goss felt no resentment at this frank
speech but insisted

  i can always look out for myself when
i cant i wont be a burden to a com-
munity

  i was thinking beyond that said brad-
ford its a mans bounden duty to look
after more than himself its his civic duty
to marry and support his wife and bring up
several youngsters to be good citizens

  goss inwardly winced but carelessly
replied

  ive always drifted and find it hard to
settle down

he carried bradfords words
with him into the little hotel he
had heard much the same in den-
ver frank ellis and his sister
condemned his occupation now he was re-
buked in a town where a cold-blooded mur-
derer was released and treated as a hero
yet he was too honest not to realize that
bradford was a fine type of citizen and
meant him well and what made him un-
easy was the fear he might come to accept
the same view of gambling as a means of
earning a living he endeavored to mock

the distinction between gambling occasion-
ally and steadily but got nowhere he
played solitaire after the noon meal and
slept for a few hours

  after supper he went to allens place and
this time found it well filled men were
still celebrating bowkers acquittal cheers
were frequently given the killer whereat
the latter leaning against the end of the
bar near the open window felt called upon
to announce his intention to exterminate all
the red man in colorado when goss
entered bowker was growing reminiscent in
his boastful talk

  pausing with a glass half raised he
grinned cunningly at his admirers and lifted
an unsteady hand for silence then began
if any of you fellers go down to the
purgatory far enough youll find seven
graves in one tree all men ask ruel
bowker how they come to be stuck up there
to dry mebbe hell tell you mebbe he
wont

  much praise greeted this intimation that
the speaker had been a wholesale killer
bowker continued

  only way to civlize this country got
to wipe em all out all of em few miles
from that tree youll find if it aint been
knocked down platform built of star
cracker boxes where some sort of a rapaho
chiefs laid out ask ruel how that feller
come to die sort of sudden mebbe hell
tell mebbe he wont

  you keep on ruel and there wont be
an injun left tween heren the mountains
applauded a bullwhacker and there cant
be too few of em to suit my game

  well there wont be enough left to make
trouble by another season modestly ad-
mitted bowker and before the end of
next summer youll begin to hear of dead
utes found scattered round up in the
hills

  the door opened and jack smith entered
and stood with his back to the wall bowker
ceased talking his gaze grew wild and he
fumbled for the pepper box in his belt
allen leaned over the bar and yanked his
hand away and warned

  none of that bowker no killings in
here

  that breed means mischief cried
bowker

  smith folded his arms and told the crowd
  that man has the heart of a rabbit
  rabbit or lion youll be a dead man if


adventure

you start any fuss warned the bull-
whacker what you mean coming here
amongst white folks for

  i have money slowly replied smith
my father was a white man the white
part of me can drink

  and he walked to the lower end of the
bar and tossed a gold piece on the board

  business was business to jack allen and
if the interpreters son could pay his way
his money was as precious and desirable as
anothers he pushed forward a bottle and
glass smiths red blood showed when he
refused the glass and drank from the bottle
several feet separated him from the other
patrons at the bar and none showed any
inclination to join him bowker craned his
neck and gazed uneasily down the line to
make sure the man was in his place and not
about to attack smith gave no heed to his
half brothers and continued drinking slowly
from the bottle bowker decided the fellow
was intimidated and he renewed his
boasting

  it made me laff he began when the
trader wanted me tried right in the street
as if there was a town or camp in colorado

that would be agin me for killing-

  a shrill whistle sounded outside in the
darkness some did not appear to notice it
among these was smith the halfbreed who
had both arms resting on the bar his hands
clutching the bottle bowker was among
those who heard being nearest the window
the whistle sounded a second time bowker
straightened and staggered from the bar
toward the window and extended a hand
as if to close it then he gave a sharp cry
and reeled back against the bar and slid
down to a sitting posture

  good- look screamed the bull-

whacker pointing

  smith with bottle half raised was the
only one not to surge around the inert
figure from under bowkers left arm pro-
truded a long feathered shaft

  indian work exclaimed goss shot
through the window

  jack smith came forward and after one
glance informed-

  arapaho arrow

  allen leaped over the bar and led the rush
to the door goss remained and saw the
breeds dark visage crack with a smile as
he more leisurely made for the exit carrying
what was left of his bottle of liquor out-
side the door came exclamations and oaths

then a rough voice rose above the others
in angrily demanding-

  what you mean running-bent into

a peaceful man

  and a powerfully built fellow entered
followed by jack allen who was endeavoring
to explain the precipitate flight from the
room

  quit that yapping and give me a drink
impatiently interrupted the newcomer
hunting injuns in pueblo is fools talk if
you want to find injuns- he halted and
stared at the dead man who done that
he hoarsely asked

ive been trying to tell you mister
allen replied some injun sneaked up to the
open winder and shot him with that arrer
i see muttered the stranger sure
hes dead

  deadern last years flowers

  the patrons of the place began returning
they had no relish for trailing a killer in the
night as they straggled into the bar room
the stranger announced

  im mose peters just down from tarry-
all maybe i bumped into some of you
boys when you was hustling through the
door or you bumped into me thought
the place must be or fire close the winder
and licker

  before returning to his post behind the
bar allen had bowkers body removed to a
shed room and sent a man to bring the
sheriff then he faced his line of customers
goss came from his corner and did what was
unusual for him when he stood beside peters
and followed the others example by taking
whisky

  peters puzzled and fascinated him the
mans clothing was new long black coat
trousers and hat all were recently pur-
chased the boots were new and shiny and
peters seemed glad to rest his weight on one
foot to ease the other like the gambler
and unlike the rest of the company he was
clean shaven his face was a walnut brown
as if tanned by the elements

  he was not a gambler but an outdoors
man much in the sun and winds the voice
had first attracted goss interest being
hoarse and reminiscent of one the gambler
had heard had peters not announced
tarryau as his starting place the gambler
would have put him down as a fresh arrival
from the river with his face hands and
wrists baked by the plains sun the hair
cut short also suggested the immigrant
pards



  but few greenhorns ever carried them-
selves with as much assurance as he was
revealing with sidelong glances the gam-
bler observed how he shifted his position
easing first one foot then the other which
was reminiscent of whip king in new foot
gear and how he twitched his broad shoul-
ders as if finding the coat to be annoying

  a chorus of voices wished peters good luck
and health allen at leisure for a minute
took over the situation and told of the
arapahos death and described the killing
of bowker the man at the end of the bar
where bowker had stood hastily finished
his drink and shifted his position down the
line another more bold attempted in pan-
tomime to show just how bowker walked
to the window cried out and fell

  the bullwhacker thumped his fist on the
bar for attention and loudly demanded-
wheres that halfbreed bet he done

it -him

  goss spoke up saying

  smith was drinking at the bar when the
man was shot he didnt leave this room
until after bowker fell to the floor

  whon-be you mister truculent-
ly asked the bullwhacker

  im the man who saw smith quit this
room after bowker was killed goss quietly
replied he couldnt be outside the win-
dow shooting in and on the inside about to
go out at the same time

  youre too - smart sneered the

bullwhacker swinging from the bar and
edging nearer goss you aint answered
my question who be you

  oh that im something of a trouble
doctor sometimes folks like you looking
for trouble come to me to be cured never
had the same patient call on me twice

  this piece of braggadocio centered all eyes
upon him as he moved a few steps from the
bar to meet the bullwhacker the bull-
whacker took careful note of his dandified
appearance and advanced no farther even
when some one laughed derisively allen
shrewdly read danger in the dark expres-
sionless face and shook his head to the bull-
whacker the latter met the steady gaze
for a few moments then decided he pre-
ferred drink to trouble and stepped back
to the bar mildly agreeing

  of course the breed couldnt be in two
places at once

  having disconcerted the bullwhacker
goss swiftly shifted his gaze and stared

squarely into the amazed face of the new-
comer his own eyes flickered in surprize
for a second then he was shouldering his
way to a position beside the man and as he
lifted his glass as though drinking the
strangers health he murmured-
lomsom

  outside grunted the white chief of
the utes then he lifted his raucous voice
in an invitation for all to drink hearty

  hank way bustled in and the drinking
was suspended while he investigated the
death of bowker allen briefly described
the tragedy and added jack smith says
the arrow was an arapaho arrow being
half injun he ought to know

  it isnt surprizing commented the
sheriff a white man cant always kill a
friendly indian and not make some of the
tribe mad wheres the body

  he was conducted to the adjoining shed
the men crowding in behind him goss and
lomsom remained at the bar the former
emptied his glass on the floor and hurriedly
asked-

  youve quit your red friends lomsom
come outside more room muttered
lomsom

  once through the door and out of the
light streaming through the windows lom-
som halted long enough to pull off his boots
and with a sigh of relief walked in his bare-
feet to the river bank they sat down near
maywoods blacksmith shop lomsom was
the first to speak saying

  beats-we should meet like this

sswx as he spoke he tossed something
over the bank and into the river
goss ducked instinctively at the
 gesture lomsom reassured
just heaving something away some-
thing i dont dast carry but one of my
utes would risk his life before hed heave it
away tail feather of a chaparral cock
hitched to a whistle good to carry in your
mouth in a medicine dance

  a whistle it was a whistle- began
goss

  i blew it met jack smith first thing on
coming to town after dark he knows me
told me about the rapahos death had to
square myself with him or kill him to stop
his giving me away he give me the
rapahos bow and arrers i blew the
whistle hoping to git the skunk to step
from the bar so i could git a shot at him
ioo

adventure

skunk oughter been killed even if my utes
dont love the rapahos

  smiths part white hen me have done
some dickering and hoss swapping on the
side but the rapahos would give a heap
for my hair so i had to trade with him
if i didnt and slipped up on killing him
on the spot the rapahos would see that i
never got back to the mountains alive
them not white folks i was skeery about
you killed bowker muttered goss
ive said so and youll keep shut
from what smith said theres white men in
this town that wanted to hang the cuss
dont go to making trouble for me and i
wont send any war pipe to you

  its so - cold-blooded bowker

needed killing all right but to kill him
offhand at some one elses say

  see here goss are you agin me i
want to know right now

  and lomsom shifted his position

  i have a very murderous derringer
covering you warned goss however
im no talker bowker was no good its
true some of the citizens favored hanging
him its all come out in the wash thats
all in the discard let go of that knife or
gun and tell me why you quit the indians
lomsom relaxed and began

  just had to take a little trip alone

- but ive been so hungry for white

mens lights and houses and a white mans
bar and victuals i just couldnt stand it
used to git me hard at times but it was
worsen ever after you three fellers skun out
told my young men i was off to the top of
a mountain to make big medicine and would
be gone some time if the medicine was slow
to work got rid of my injun rig cleaned
off the paint and put on some odds and ends
of clothes my boys stole from the whites
then i made tabors store at buckskin and

bought this outfit but- them boots

theyll be the death of me

  goss still nonplussed by the mans un-
concern over bowkers death endeavored
to hide his aversion and next inquired-
going back to the utes soon

  have to winter with em but if i find
what im looking for on this trip ill quit
em for good next season

looking for something prompted goss
for that young skunk with the funny
name euclid cuss him he knows more
about gold than gregory does he busted
all my plans when he skinned out on me

  the utes would have killed him if he
hadnt escaped reminded goss

  mebbe some one had to be killed after
smoking that medicine-pipe but if you
had stuck my mans hide would have been
safe tother young feller was the one they
was keen to burn theyll burn him yet if
they ever git hold of him whered he
go to

  denver on his way to the river by
this time you came down the valley

  by traveling at night and keeping to the
south side of the river some of my utes
are down near canon city looking for
hosses didnt want to run foul of them
explained lomsom yesterday i made a
big smoke thatll scare them bac to the
mountains theyll think its made by
cheyennes and rapahos know where that
euclid is

  havent an idea probably in denver
central city up that way somewheres
lomsom swore under his breath then
complained

  it beat all bad luck that i had to lose
him i know half a dozen likely gold
placers any one of them would make my
everlasting fortune if i knew what he knows
about gold with a big pile of dust id
light out for the river and keep on going till
i struck some big city in the east then
id settle down and live like a genleman
of course thats the trick to turn the
gambler encouraged but just what are
you down here for

  to search the valley for the young feller
had to begin at this end as my utes were
hanging round canon city now the
smokes scared them back ill look for him
up stream on my way back then again
goss im lonely god knows how lonely
i was born and raised white i am white
i knifed a man in pete dotsons wagon
train out of salt lake city he had it
coming to him but i had to run for it i
fell in with a small band of utes painted
up and become their leader younger men
who wouldnt mind the older leaders ive
been with them ever since they look on
me as one of them ive tried to be one of
them almost fooled myself at times but
i cant ever forgit im white and im
hungry for white mens company im sick
of paint and lodges and eating injun grub
out of a kettle ive seen the time when id
almost trade one of my secret placers for
some white cooking specially cake
pards



  goss waited for him to talk himself out
and then inquired-

  about the rabbit what happened to
him after we escaped

  nothing he had the stone god to
trade made the bargain on the pipe hes
slick utes want to keep him nothing
could happen to him even if he hadnt given
the stone god back as the walking dead
man hes mighty big medicine theyd as
quick think of trying to hurt a ghost as him
he left a couple of days after you did but
what a fool to go back to the nation to be
stuck up against a cartwheel or tree and
shot

  odd but hes a real man nothing
can stop him from doing what he believes
is his duty dont go back to the utes
lomsom plenty of room for you nevada
or the rich diggings up north or on a ranch
down here

  my medicine tells me to find pay dirt
enough to send me back east before i can
be shut of the utes well lets be gitting
back you keep shut and ill keep shut
and with a groan he pulled on his boots
just a minute only an idea of mine
i know two men who know as much if not
more about placers than euclid does im
sort of thinking to do a little prospecting
early next season we might make a trade
you lead a party of us to one of your hidden
placers if theres gold in it therell be
enough for five of us

  lomsom remained silent for a couple of
minutes then slowly said

  thats a talk ill have to smoke on i
dont mind others making a killing if i can
make mine but i aint going to risk un-
covering a rich lode and be robbed of my
share

   it ivas only an idea carelessly replied
goss youd be foolish to go into it if you
couldnt trust me by spring ill probably
be out of the notion well go back

  ill think it over and smoke on it
mumbled lomsom crawling to his feet
just remember im mose peters down here
first time you ever see me you keep shut
and ill keep shut

  im no talker repeated the gambler
but theres nothing you can say thatll
hurt me going under my own name talk
your head off if you want to

  they walked slowly back from the river
and toward the lights of the saloon lomsom
limping and cursing his new boots lomsom

was in the lead as they reached the saloon
goss felt a hand on his arm and wheeled
quickly and recognized jack smith the
half-breed

  you be careful inside muttered the
breed black bill is in there hes been
told you have money youll be asked to
play cards

  whyd you bother to tell me this
murmured goss

you told them i was in the room when
one man tried to pin bowkers death on me
he vanished abruptly around the corner
of the building lomsom held the door part
way open and querulously asked

  whats the matter lost something
  found a friend

  the sheriff had concluded his inquiry and
had had the unfortunate bowker removed
some dozen men were in the room allen
came forward and informed goss

  some of the boys are keen for a little
poker theyd love to have you sit in
and your friend

  the last to lomsom

  goss shook his head and said-

   i never care for a little poker

  lomsom was in a different mood and
eagerly urged

  lets draw a few cards im hungry
to play

  goss glanced about the room to discover
black bill and found him sitting with two
men at a side table he told allen

  i never care for small stakes ill wait
till some one comes in who feels rich

  he had spoken so that all in the room
might hear and the big man swarthy of
face and with the small eyes of an indian
came to his feet and bowed and in excellent
english called out

  the senor need not hesitate because of
the stakes i will cut the deck with him for
what he has in his clothes

  the loungers worked forward to enjoy
the situation for a few moments goss was
marveling how so small a voice could come
from so big a man he had expected to hear
a bull-like roar and had he not seen the
speaker he would have said a child had
strayed into the place and was prattling
black bill grinned wickedly as he detected
what he believed to be confusion in the
young man goss briskly advanced to the
table and replied

  all right thats man-sized talk bring
a sealed deck of cards ill cut you for two


adventure

thousand on the high card ace is top-
high

lomsom at his shoulder hoarsely urged
cut him for four thousand ill put up
that much medicine tells me youre lucky
black bill flashed an ugly glance at the
two but his voice was a liquid treble as he
shrugged his shoulders and confessed

  that is beyond me the senor is very
rich i withdraw

  but youve got some money aint you
growled lomsom then to goss oh
lets play and he impatiently rattled gold
pieces in the capacious pocket of his long
coat if these fellers are shy of money ive
got enough to make it interesting even for
you goss

  all right surrendered goss slipping
into a chair so his back would be to the wall
anew deck table stakes so every man
has a chance for his money

  he produced two thousand dollars in gold
and paper and arranged it before him

  would fifty dollars limit be enough for
the grand senor politely piped black bills
diminutive voice

  excellent

  we like nothing but jackpots down
here continued black bill the ante
shall we say two or five dollars

  five barked lomsom as he stacked
twenty-dollar pieces from the denver mint

black bill sat on goss left
a nondescript on his right the
fifth man was between black bill
and lomsom the latter facing
the wall black bill produced nine hundred
dollars his two companions each tabled
less goss did not play in the first two
hands and was quick to realize the three
men were playing for a common purse
that they had some system of signaling was
obvious after the two hands after the
first bet which was raised back by the last
of the trio two would drop out leaving the
strongest hand to battle against lomsom

  the latter lost both times but played with
much enthusiasm and evidenced his inten-
tion to participate in every pot goss sat
in the next two hands until the whip-sawing
commenced when he dropped out lomsom
lost four hundred dollars very quickly but
continued to smile

  it came goss deal and he played the
limit was bet to draw cards and he pushed
in his money it was raised back by the

man on his right and he patiently saw it
the man on black bills left raised again
lomsom who had stayed smiling with much
content for the first time gave it a boost
the man on goss right hesitated as if con-
fused and dropped out goss saw and
raised black bills broad face seemed to
grow even darker he hesitated for two
seconds then pushed in a hundred and fifty
dollars the man on his left was glad to
retire lomsom laughed loudly and shoved
his cards into the dead wood and informed-
just having fun trying to bluff

  between you and me senor shrilly re-
marked black bill

  goss raised him back black bill saw it
and spent a minute weighing his hand he
took one card goss drew three black
bill cursed softly and dropped when the
limit was bet goss stuck his cards in the
deck and stacked his winnings

  lomsom gloated

  thats the time he got under your hide
mister and at that im thinking you had
the best hand

  you talk too much lisped black bill

  lomsom rested one foot on the round of
his chair incidentally bringing the top of
the boot leg closer to his hand and picked
up his cards despite his indian training
he betrayed exultation and raised for cards
after black bill had opened the betting
before the draw was fast and furious goss
kept out and began pocketing his money
black bill exhausted his pile and borrowed
what remained before his friends the two
dropping after the second raise

  lomsom grunted and chuckled as if much
delighted and taunted-

  youre in for another licking pretty
voice

   the spectators gathered close to the table
among them was a well built man who
walked with a vigorous step goss was the
only person in the room who had seen him
enter he halted behind lomsoms chair
and appeared to be deeply interested in the
outcome of the battle as lomsom boasted
and threatened the newcomer tilted his head
as if to hear the better goss watched him
idly at first then more closely as he moved
to one side as if to get a better view of
lomsoms cards or his profile then the
game demanded the gamblers attention as
from the corner of his eye he caught a move-
ment of black bills left hand dropping for
a second below the edge of the table
pards



  black bill sorrowfully announced

  i must call i have no more money
lomsom was disappointed and regret-
fully agreed-

  then we can only draw and show our
hands

  each drew two cards goss thrust the
fingers of his right hand into his left sleeve
and told lomsom the mans cheating
he has two cards on his knee if his friend
hasnt taken them

  you dare hissed the accused darting
his left hand to sash

  goss suggestively permitted the handle
of a derringer to show below his cuff and
replied-

  yes i dare

  hold up commanded lomsom dont
anybody break up this pot i know he
cheated mighty clumsy done man be-
tween us sneaked the cards from his knee
and has them in his left sleeve this minute
as he finished speaking he darted out his
right hand and ripped the mans sleeve to
the elbow and allowed two cards to fall on
the floor

  beat those pretty voice and he
threw down four kings then he raked in
the pot and with his left hand proceeded to
stuff his pockets as he was picking up the
last of the money he casually said-

  i cheated a little when i saw you was
going below the table with cards

  black bill stared at him in baleful silence
then threw down his hand and slowly rose
and stepped behind his chair goss fol-
lowed every move and did not see the man
behind lomsoms chair suddenly bow his
head and glance into the renegades face
the first he learned that anything aside from
the game was happening was when he heard
the explosive cry

  lomsom i thought i knew you
lomsom came to his feet with the quick-
ness of a cat and swung his chair violently
against the legs of the speaker and seized
him by the collar and pulled him forward
to sprawl over it with one jump he was
at the door

  allen was screaming-

  hes killed pete dotson

  but dotson the former freighter from
salt lake city got his footing as lomsom
passed into the night and started after him
only to have his path blocked by three men

  goss switched his gaze back to black bill
and covered him with the derringer just as

the long knife was leaving the sash black
bill yelped and ducked and dodged and
gained the window at the upper end of the
bar opened it and vaulted through it

  goss turned his head in time to see dot-
son clear the doorway in pursuit of lomsom
one of the strangers who his back to the
table was staring after dotson now turned
about revealing a scarred face goss gave
one glance and holding the derringer in his
open hand greeted

  glad you have shown up delouge the
game has been slow and whats worse
crooked man man keep your hands
from that belt this gun is small but mur-
derous send your friends to the bar while
we have a bit of a talk

chapter x

the duel

tvelouge slipped into the chair vacat-
ed by lomsom and stared thought-
fully at the gambler the two men ab-
sorbed in each other were unconscious of
the excitement aroused by the white chiefs
flight from pete dotson rancher on the
south fork of st charles without moving
his head or shifting his gaze from the gam-
blers marble face delouge said to snap
and seth behind him

  clear out boys get a drink keep
away from me ill look you up later

  we come along to lend a hand re-
minded snap

  you came along so you wouldnt get
hurt while riding to texas clear out re-
peated delouge without raising his voice

  those who had trailed after dotson were
now straggling back talking loudly but
ignorant as to the reason of lomsoms flight
they had ventured only a short distance
before realizing it was foolish to trade lights
and drinks for the chance of a bullet in the
darkness these and those who had re-
mained in the room sensed nothing of the
drama developing at the side table

  delouge was the first to speak he said-
id hoped to catch up with you in
quieter surroundings

  you come bringing trouble of course
replied goss his hands clasped before him
the derringer back in its sleeve holster

  ive delayed my trip south risked being

murdered by-yanks just to pay you

for what you did to my friend


adventure

  a cheat and murderer before i killed
him in self-defense said goss

  delouge winced and replied

  im not his judge the south lost a
good man when you killed him

 your point of view ill kill the best
man the south has if he tries to murder me
and im able to kill him

   im not interested in the ethics of it
softly remarked delouge i was simply
answering your question

  thats ended but im interested to
know how you found me so quickly said
goss

  you are undone by kindness returned
delouge the corner of his mouth twisting
up in a crooked smile you bought a lot
of grub and packed it down the valley on a
mule i found the mule

  goss face slipped from control for an
instant delouge observed it and smiled
the more

   a little ranch house a young lady who
lied nobly said you hadnt been there
her brother is rather stupid i think but
she seemed to know i was carrying a fight
she vowed you had not been there the mo-
ment i put the question

   delouge id forgive anything before id
forgive trouble to the young people at the
ranch murmured goss im not ducking
a fight any longer had i known youd been
to that ranch you would have met me on the
road coming to find you

   delouges eyes glowed with feral light

why-you he softly began youre

taking it for granted i dont know how to
treat quality folks the young man is slow
to comprehend things but he is a gentle-
man the young woman might have been
my sister so far as any word of mine could
ruffle her feelings

  goss believed him the man could be as
deadly as a cobra but no woman would ever
have cause to complain of him the gam-
bler had met the type before and frankly
apologized

  i was too quick to suspect the wrong
thing youre not that sort perhaps i
wont fight as well now i know you were
courteous to my friends but i shall feel
much better

  to - with your feelings youve

charged me with being the worst thing
possible

   and im going to give you satisfaction
coldly assured goss i dont like the no-

tion of having folks looking for me and
following at my back is it to be a nip and
tuck affair right here or something arranged
and carried out by rule i see you have
brought two friends with you

   the second insult since ive been in this
chair youve seen my friends before you
know theyd be snagged by some of your
yankee friends if left alone if i cant beat
you on the draw as we sit here i surely can
kill you while youre killing me but my
idea is to walk off alone together one man
coming back

  goss nodded and unclasped his hands
and approved

  that would be much better than shoot-
ing each other up at this table wed both
die theres a chance for one to live the
other way and im beginning to feel lucky
good softly exclaimed delouge im
carrying one gun of course youre out-
fitted

  a thirty-one colt and a derringer ill
discard the derringer

  keep it itll balance my gun a forty-
four i want no advantage in this business
and theres no time like tonight i should
be leading my friends toward texas before
sun-up the starlight is very bright and i
suppose theres plenty of room around here
where we wont be interrupted

  down by the ruins of the flour mill will
do nicely promptly informed goss

  then lets be moving im mortal keen
to be riding south

  goss admiringly told him

  i like your optimism i like to see a man
play his hand just as though he believed its
a winner im ready

  and he pushed back his chair and cast a
swift glance at delouges two followers
who were busy at the bar delouge
quickly assured him

  snap and seth will wait for me here if
you come back theyll strike out down the
valley alone have you any arrangements
to make

  what money is in my clothes and a
paper showing i own a ranch are to be
given to ellis and his sister where you
found the mule if left with john thatcher
or allen bradford with those instructions
either will carry out my wishes

   ill see that its done if i have to break
my trip and carry them in person promised
delouge

  goss smiled grimly and observed
pards



  youre very confident but youd better
tell your friends to have their horses ready
and to ride hard and fast once i return for
i might not be able to save them pueblo
men rode down the river last night hunting
for southern men their rum gave out
they didnt ride far next time theyll try
hard to make a killing

  an accident might happen quietly
agreed delouge coming to his feet ill
advise them accordingly

  he walked to the bar and talked to seth
and snap and while thus engaged a shout
of laughter caused him to wheel the
gathering was mirthful over the sadly bat-
tered appearance of a man standing in the
doorway

  darned if it aint vince moore
shouted the bullwhacker you look like
a thousand steers had trompled on you
vince

  in another minute his clothes will drop
off cried another

  moores face was bruised and swollen al-
most beyond recognition his clothes were
ripped and torn his belt held no weapons
he slowly advanced to the bar and poured
out a stiff drink then he slowly fastened
his gaze on the laughing men and there
was something in the half-closed discolored
eyes that quickly caused the merriment to
subside bolting his drink he hoarsely
promised

  those who treated me like this will pay
a mighty high price and i dont feel
like gentling any one that takes it as a
joke

  shucks vince were your friends
cried the bullwhacker we thought youd
been tossed by your hoss if any ones
played you dirt you know who to call
on

 moore cast a glance at his torn clothes
and grimly informed the bullwhacker

  all right im calling on you now come
outside

  with that he limped to the door
slowly followed by the wondering bull-
whacker

  delouge returned to the table and goss
remarked-

  other folks seem to be having their
troubles

  that moores a bad customer never
saw him before but ive heard of him his
game is stealing horses hope he gets what
he deserves must have run into a bad

storm no gun clothes nearly ripped off
him walks as if he was broken into pieces
hes been manhandled severely but no gun
fighter did it ive spoken to the boys and

we can get down to business

  goss led the way outdoors and glanced
about for moore and the bullwhacker the
two worthies were not to be seen without
a word the duelists walked toward what was
left of the first flour mill built in pueblo
erected and equipped for work in seven
days by b a rockafellow it had burned to
the ground before it could turn out a bag
of flour

  when a short distance from the ruins
goss halted and impatiently remarked-
seems some one is ahead of us weu
go down on the river bank

  delouge suggested

  we can wait a bit theyll be moving
on soon

  he sat down and gross dropped to the
ground beside him

  several figures by the ruins moved toward
the waiting men they were talking and
one raised his voice and declared

  but we dont need any army vince
black bills a plenty if you round up any
more ill be thinking youre planning to
tackle a fort

  bills the only one ed will fetch told
him to bring me a gun

  eds the bullwhacker goss whispered
to delouge

  thatll make six of us grumbled the
man who objected to a crowd spose we
leave culp and ben out of it fours
enough

  not by a jugful objected a new voice
any fun going on were in it aint that
your mind ben

  all the time replied a nasal voice
waggles always keen to play a lone hand
if theres a pretty woman in it

  pretty - snarled moore look

here dont you fellers size this game up
wrong her brother left me looking like
this got my gun in the bargain of course
he jumped me by surprize when i lowed he
was wilting but he got me me vince
moore none of you folks think im any
chicken

  youre no scrub vince agreed waggle
feller must bp a natural-born killer to do
what he done with his naked hands

  worsen any bad man i ever ran
against growled vince
io

adventure

a low whistle sounded below
the ruins the talking ceased
the signal was answered and two
figures came around the east end
of the ruins then moore exclaimed-
black bill and ed

  the four of them turned about and
hastened to join black bill and the bull-
whacker

  goss clasped his hand around delouges
wrist and tightened his grip until delouge
reminded

  youre forgetting theres a bone there
whats all that talk mean making trouble
for some woman i take it

  planning trouble for the young woman
who lied to you gritted goss her
brothers my friend but i never knew he
could manhandle any one the way moores
been used

  that youngster incredulously whis-
pered delouge he appeared to me to be
a sheep the girl did all the talking

  he wasnt a sheep when moore called on
him was the grim reply the man they
call waggle is a bad one ought to have
killed him in california gulch when i ran
his boss charley dodge out of the camp
look here delouge this trouble of ours
must wait some fifteen miles down the
river is a ranch where you and your friends
will be welcome its a rendezvous for
southern men making back home to get
into the big fight im riding up the river
road mighty soon ill send word to you
or come to find you after ive finished my
business and get back to pueblo

  i always hanker to keep close to the man
im planning to shoot ill go with you
murmured delouge

  thats mighty decent of you i may
be glad of your gun whispered goss but
youre making it harder for me when we
walk out alone next time now we must
get our horses and keep watch to know
when they start up the valley

  ill have to get a fresh horse said de-
louge got any friends in town wholl
keep an eye on them and bring us the word
when they start

  goss rapidly recalled the men he had met
in pueblo and finally decided

  theres a fellow a mixed-blood jack
smith by name he thinks hes in my debt
the sheriff wont do hed stop them and
simply postpone their visit and we want
the-business settled and not hanging

fire if i cant locate smith well have to do
our own watching arrange for a horse and
meet me at suttles hotel on santa fe
avenue

  they hurried back to the town and sepa-
rated goss glanced through the windows
of allens saloon but the half-breed was not
there he went on and entered thatchers
store and announced-

  found ill need one of those remington
forty-fours

  i sell guns said thatcher but id
rather sell hoes and shovels dont get
round-shoulders from carrying too many
weapons my young friend

  ill be careful promised goss throwing
down the price and gathering up the re-
volver and some ammunition

  returning to the street he made straight
for suttles and in front of the place came
upon the man he was looking for jack
smith the half-breed snarled like a moun-
tain cat as he saw a man rapidly bearing
down on him then the gambler entered
the light of a window lamp and the breed
stood erect and sullenly advised-

  dont run at a man even if hes part
indian

  ive been hunting for you smith im
wanting to give you this twenty-dollar gold
piece and to ask a favor

  he thrust the coin into the breeds hand
and rapidly told him the service he required

  you dont have to give me gold slowly
said smith but ill keep it i know the

men all of them-them a few miles

down the valley and some of my mothers
folks would be glad to wipe them out for
me ill be glad to bring you word but
as it promises to be a big fight let me go
with you

  as a fighting man youd be welcome
said goss but if youre mixed up in it
it would mean the slaughter of more in-
dians you keep out of it i have a rare
man riding with me hes to meet me here
be off and find them they were down by
the flour mill probably back at allens
by this time

  smith darted away and goss entered the
hotel and proceeded to load his new gun
uncle tommy watched him anxiously and
inquired thinking of going to war

  had in mind to shoot some skunks
explained goss

  with his weapons ready goss took a posi-
tion a short distance above the hotel
pards



twenty minutes passed then delouge
came up goss signaled to him and the
southerner reported

  i arranged with aaron simms for the
loan of a horse learned anything

  the gambler told about smith and in-
vited his enemy into the hotel delouge
feared the men might steal from town with-
out the mixed-blood discovering their de-
parture this was sufficient to alarm goss
and he suggested

  then one of us must remain here for
smith while the other looks for moore and
his friends ill stay as smith wouldnt
report to you better keep close to allens
theyll go there for a drink

  delouge vanished down the street goss
shifted his position to one across the street
in the deep shadows across and opposite
the hotel he waited so long that he began
to fear both smith and delouge had de-
serted him or had lost the trail his fears
for the elliss safety became acute to
leave his post would be to risk missing the
half-breed he crossed the street having
decided to enlist uncle tommy and to send
him to reconnoiter allens place and report
back on those present he was at the door
when a furtive figure darted from the
shadows across the street and in a low
voice hailed him goss gave a sigh of relief
on beholding smith

  the half-breed informed

  theyve been drinking all this time
now they go for their horses

  did you see a man with a scar on his
face

  he was outside he said he was scout-
ing for you he ran away when the men
left the bar to get their horses

  my horse is in the little corral behind the
hotel go and saddle him and bring him
here im waiting for the man with the
scar

  smith hurried away he was soon back
with the gamblers horse there followed
a brief period of waiting then sounded the
welcome clump-clump of hoofs as goss
swung into the saddle delouge rode into
the light mounted on a rawbone roan
your mans reported i see he greeted

this beast is an ugly- but simms says

he can travel with the best shall we make
for the valley road

  goss nodded and led the way on the
west side of the town they halted having
discovered no signs of the raiders from

behind them in the village the singing and
shouting of men believing these to be their
quarry they drew back from the highway
and waited the clamor died down and yet
no horsemen appeared goss impatiently
decided

  well ride on if were ahead of them
well be there to meet them if behind we
must arrive on their heels

  i dont believe theyve started said
delouge then he cautioned some one
rides from the west question him

  a rider was approaching at a hand gallop
the gambler took the middle of the road
and called out-

  friend did you pass five or six men rid-
ing up the valley

  i see two of you but youre the one i
have covered replied the rider

  he reined in and dismounted

  my name is goss my friend and i are
strangers here we seek six men riding
west

  im pete dotson and ive been chasing
a cowardly murderer your six friends are
tearing up the road half drunk poor com-
pany to be hunting both of you pass on
and give me the road

  much obliged but they wont thank
us for overtaking them said goss

  and followed by delouge he circled
around dotson who had his belt gun resting
across the saddle to guard against treachery

  the two proceeded at a smashing gallop
for the first mile then delouge spurred up
beside his companion and reminded

  not too fast we have some thirty miles
to cover

  im not keen for them to reach the ranch
ahead of us answered goss

  yet he pulled down to a more sensible
pace

  they covered ten miles at a moderate gait

and goss was again growing fearful they
would be too late when the faint sound of
voices struck them he was for pressing
forward smartly but delouge drew abreast
and advised

dont be a fool theyre taking it easy
and having a bit of a sing no road fighting
in the dark we can close in any time i
want more light when i begin shooting
goss recognized the wisdom of this and
dropped to a walk delouge continued-
the boys understand that if you come
back alone youre not to be troubled
thanks i never go hunting for trouble
io

adventure

gruffly replied goss well hope both of us
are lucky on this trip

  and split up our hopes on the next trip
exactly agreed the musical voice

  of course said goss

  and he knew that only one of them at the
best could survive when they turned against
each other yet he admired the southerner
he admired his courage in riding down
grape creek and into canon city when
there were many men in the valley who
would be glad to use guns in stopping his
journey south he admired his courage in
abandoning his swift and stealthy flight to
texas in order to court more trouble by
stretching the hunt to pueblo with such
an indomitable man on ones track there was
but one escape-by killing him

  the men ahead jogged along smartly but
with no pretense of haste it was obvious
they felt secure and believed they could
afford to wait until the first morning light
before commencing their evil work the
hours lagged but at last the star paled and
a vague light came from the east now
there was the danger of the six discovering
the two when the country afforded it the
pursuers swung away from the road

  the light increased until they could per-
ceive the horsemen riding in a compact
body soon they could make out the in-
dividuals the riders were taking their
time but they no longer sang and ghouted
their mood would be doubly vicious now
the effects of allens taos lightning was
wearing off at last the horizon reddened
before the approach of the sun and the six
men quickened their pace to a hard gallop

  lets close in and begin urged goss

  just a bit more light restrained de-
louge id be ashamed to be knocked
over by a chance shot from such trash i
want light enough to see just where im
sending my lead

  another two miles and goss frantically
exclaimed 

  were there theyre quitting the
road

  off to the right they soon made out the
small ranch house and delouge swore gent-
ly as he beheld the thin blue smoke lazily
rising from the chimney he had hoped the
men would arrive before the young people
had unbarred the door he lifted the big
roan alongside of goss spirited mount and
the two thundered along stirrup to stirrup

  goss was the first to make out a figure

standing in the doorway of the ranch but
could not tell if it were ellis or his sister
as a warning he pulled a gun and fired it in
the air

  the horseman nearest the cabin glanced
back the ranch door closed the raiders
faced about and on discovering there were
but two horsemen leaving the road to attack
them they separated into two bands and
riding far apart galloped to meet the in-
truders

  delouge cried

  draw off to the left we must keep
apart

  he turned his horse to meet the three men
approaching on his right

the first rays of the new sun
swept the valley and brilliantly
illuminated the scene diverging
to the left with the forty-four in
his hand goss saw his three foes consisted
of vince moore black bill and a man he
had never seen before to his knowledge he
spared a glance for the trio riding to assail
delouge and beheld bill waggle in the lead
next to him came ed the bullwhacker and
an unknown these two unidentified men
he knew must be ben and culp

  the three coming to meet the gambler had
been riding in single file now they sepa-
rated widely moore taking a wide circle as
if to attack on the flank or in the rear
black bill coming almost head on fired the
first shot he recognized the gambler and
shouted terrible threats goss bore steadly
on reserving his fire black bill fired a
second shot and swung off to his right tak-
ing the same course pursued by moore
moore was so far off-side that goss needed
to turn his hjead to watch him a bullet
sang dangerously close to his head fired by
the originator of the raid

  goss suddenly decided he was being out-
maneuvered to guard against moore he
must remove his gaze from black bill and
the third man to reduce the odds he vio-
lently checked his mount and threw him-
self to the ground and crouched low dirt
flew up in his face bullets flew over his
head from three directions and had the
men been afoot he doubtless would have
been mortally wounded or killed outright
before he could fire his first shot

  he centered his attention on moore long
enough to shoot once moore had wheeled
about and was racing toward him from the
pards



left the horse gave a scream of pain and
reared goss could not afford another in-
stant of attention in that direction as swift
hoofs were thundering down on him on his
right

  at first he thought the horse was rider-
less and then discovered black bill was
hanging from the saddle like an indian
he brought down the remington forty-four
and fired

  the horse came to a plunging halt and
reared and stood so erect it seemed he must
topple over backward then pivoted and
swung his rider into view instantly the
big gun boomed the second time and black
bills hands relaxed loosing the grip on the
saddle and dropping the gun goss saw the
man slide headlong to the ground a foot
twisted in the stirrup and shifted his atten-
tion to moore as that worthy was emptying
his revolver and dusting the ground with
his lead moore was still mounted but was
not rushing to close quarters

  goss fired at the dancing horse and saw it
give a convulsive jump then he jerked his
head about as shots sounded in the direction
of the cabin the third rider bending low
in the saddle and riding for life was pound-
ing for the road to the west the gambler
had a glimpse of a figure in the doorway of
the ranch firing a revolver and wheeled to
give further attention to moore behind
him boomed the detonations of several shots
but he could spare no time to learn how de-
louge was faring

  he began shooting at moore who was
wildly snapping an empty gun moore
lurched sideways and almost lost his seat
then he dropped his weapon and slumped
forward and his frantic mount carried him
to the road and in the direction of pueblo
at a mad gallop

  now the gambler was free to assist de-
louge he shifted his position his big
gun empty and drew the colt  he was in
time to witness the end of the fight young
ellis was running from the house shooting
after moore the girl stood in the doorway
waggle was down the bullwhacker was
down the third man barely able to keep
in the saddle was making back to the
road

  delouge had fought from the saddle
he slipped to the ground as goss ran for-
ward ellis ceased firing and ran toward
the victors his sister left the doorway and
slowly walked as far as the end of the house

although the danger was past the gambler

shouted to her-

  go back

  she had halted before he spoke now she
came on her face white her lips tightly
pressed together when she came up to the
three silent men she whispered-

  what have you saved us from
robbery maam replied goss these
men are rascals

  were rascals you mean nate ex-
citedly corrected ellis

  delouge with the glitter of battle still
lighting his dark eyes swept off his hat and
bowed low and politely added

  by good luck madame i found in
pueblo the young man who had not been
here while we were chatting about various
things we chanced to overhear these bandits
planning this visit we rode after them
you behold

  youve killed them faintly cried the
girl staring fearfully at the three prostrate
figures

  delouge glanced over the battle field
approvingly and replied

  i trust so no theres one who still
lives

  he walked toward ed the bullwhacker
in gods mercy dont kill any more
screamed the girl

  delouge half turned and held up empty
hands then kneeled to examine the groaning
man suddenly he seized the wretch by the
arm and yanked him to his feet and in great
disgust called out

  this rat is barely hurt creased along
the top of his shoulder then to the ter-
rified bullwhacker you unspeakable-

catch one of those horses and never let me
see you again

  groaning and yelping the bullwhacker
managed to secure waggles mount and
climbed into the saddle the last they saw
of him he was drumming his heels and
galloping down the pueblo road

  please go into the house maam goss
begged of the girl

  she wanted to speak but her lips trembled
and without a word she ran to the house

  now nate what in sin does all this
shooting and killing mean demanded
ellis not yet recovered from his amaze-
ment i saw men riding up to the house
and opened the door then came a shot
and i closed the door and jumped for a gun
from the window i recognized you then


adventure

every one began shooting i thought sure
you was hit when you quit your horse i
fired at the man nearest the house the one
who rode toward canon city but why did
they come here and what did they want
goss explained the situation fully ellis
exclaimed

  i cant expose armie to danger like that
im no coward but i cant run even a
shadow of a chance of harm coming to her
and moores one of those who got away
hell never come back assured de-
louge i know the breed he didnt dare
come this time without five to back him
the really dangerous ones are dead they
wont try it again now lets have a look
he lead the way to waggle who had been
shot between the eyes they passed on to
black bill dragged some distance before
his foot slipped free of the stirrup he was
shot through the heart

  only two out of six what will seth and
snap think of that they could have done
as well muttered delouge

  but neither of us is hurt and you creased
the bullwhacker and wounded your third
man he could barely stick to the saddle
when he rode off moore is badly hurt
ill vouch for that my third man ran for
it without coming to close quarters i think
weve done well goss summed up

  good land mr delouge is hurt his
trousers leg is bloody cried ellis glaring
at the southerners left leg

  that was waggles first shot and he was
shooting at random explained delouge
didnt do any damage i can walk
into the house while we have a look at
it ordered goss

  delouge demurred not wishing to alarm
the girl but the two insisted and soon had
him inside with his boot off and the trousers
leg cut away at the knee  the bullet had
cut a furrow across the side of his leg above
the knee

  he was ashamed at the fuss made over
it and was very apologetic to the girl and
would have pulled on his boot and gone out-
side had she not brought a basin of hot
water and clean cloths then she motioned
the men away and washed the wound

  you mustnt bother young lady re-
monstrated delouge diffidently its only
a scratch amounts to nothing

  she said nothing until the wound was
cleansed and dressed then she told him

  i lied to you i cant imagine what ever

made me believe you were an enemy to mr
goss but i did believe it and i lied and
you had seen the mule and knew all the time
i had lied i told my brother you could be

very deadly but that a woman neednt ever
fear you you didnt even let me know you
had learned the truth by seeing that mule
im so glad to find i was mistaken to
know that you and mr goss are friends
they talk about a womans instinct its
all foolishness or just a catty disposition to
suspect strangers im ashamed of myself
she turned away and came to a halt on
beholding the silent figures outside one
moment they had been man-killing ma-
chines and the next they were indifferent
to all of earth for all time her nerves quite
gave way with a grimace of soul-sickness
she ran into the other room and closed the
door behind her but she could not keep
them from hearing the sound of her
sobbing

  too-bad we didnt kill the skunks

out of sight of this house muttered de-
louge - but i cant stand this i

must get out we must load them on
horses fetch a shovel young man then
try to quiet your sister its horrible
they loaded the dead men on horses
delouge riding and goss walking as they
moved down the road for a mile they
packed their victims toward pueblo and even
then were not satisfied until they had moved
half a mile back from the road for as
delouge said it would not do to have re-
minders of the tragedy for the girl to behold
when she went away from the ranch

    p it was midday when they re-
y turned to the ranch house din-
cfsjijk ner was ready but the girl did not
i	sit down she had recovered from

her spell of weeping and appeared to be com-
posed as she hovered about them anxious
to anticipate their wants nor did young
ellis have much of an appetite when they
had finished and the table was cleared goss
informed

  no one will claim that horse out there
theres another thats running loose some-
where youre welcome to both of them
frank

no ellis sharply replied its ended
we want nothing to remind us of it
well take them back to pueblo and
turn them over to the sheriff by rights it
ought to be reported to the sheriff up at
pards

hi

canon said delouge and im glad to
see youre yourself again young lady

  she shook her head and told him

  it is very horrible i thought id be
contented to stay here quite a while now
i feel different

  you an go back to the river just as
soon as you can catch a wagon-train out
from denver spoke up goss his dark face
bleak and hopeless youre not shut in
here the door is open theres the wagon
and nags that fetched you down here

  but delouge insisted

  go when and where you will miss ellis
but dont misjudge the country because of
what happened here this morning there
are just as many brutes east of the missis-
sippi it was mighty unfortunate you had
to go through this but it wont happen
again the territory is better off without
those men they had no redeeming quali-
ties whatever but you wont be bothered
again if you live here many many years
thats true maam eagerly agreed
goss why dont you pay a visit to some
of your neighbors till you work into a better
frame of mind any of them will be mighty
pleased to have you feel perfectly free to
stay as long as you like and no matter how
long you stay theyll hate to have you leave
them

  theres jesse frazer cried ellis he
called on us offered every kindness
wants to let us have hens and a cow or two
we can ride over there annie if you dont
think better of it after talking with him and
his wife well go back east

  delouge went out to look after his horse
the girl timidly suggested-

  why dont you stop here for awhile
mr goss

  id like to better than anything else
but you wont need any protector frank
is enough to scare all bad men away be-
sides no more of that breed will call here
pueblo is still laughing over the way frank
handled vince moore moore will ride out
of the country as fast as horseflesh can carry
him hell never come up this road again
he didnt dare come this time until he had
five to ride with him dont get the notion
that every man out here is a ruffian a
bigger per cent are honest decent men than
youll find in the east

  i dont think im afraid of anyone com-
ing here again bringing trouble i feel up-
set over this mornings work but im not

afraid i didnt mean that you should

settle down at least take a vacation from
your business

  gambling he corrected im already
planning something different i may take
a whack at mining next season

  good ill go with you cried ellis
only next seasons a long ways off stay
here and grow fat on annies cooking

  goss glanced through the window at de-
louge who was waiting for him

  by and by ill come and visit for a few
days just now i have an important matter
to settle one that delouge is interested in
you two visit the frazers if i come and
youre not at home ill ride over there and
hunt you up 

  the girl said nothing but her brother was
both curious and a bit envious

  is it mining nate if so i might leave
annie with the frazers and try it once
more

  lead mine replied goss and still star-
ing at delouge it wont pay youd
be wasting your time youll see me or hear
from me inside of two weeks and id
rather stay here right now than to hold four
aces

  he abruptly shook hands with ellis and
the girl and hurried out and swung into the
saddle

  ellis and his sister followed the gambler
and shook hands with delouge he stared
over their heads to the ridgepole of the house
as the girl told him

  you too are always welcome come
and see us we want you

  you make me feel very proud he told
her dropping his gaze i should prize
your hospitality greatly you are very
brave and i wish you all sorts of good things
but the chances are you wont see me again
as i shall ride south immediately to fight for
the confederacy if my plans are not vio-
lently interrupted good-by

  he touched his horse and smartly gal-
loped away goss waved his hand and rode
to overtake him in the road the gambler
looked back and waved his hand again at
the young couple but delouge did not
turn his head they covered several miles
in silence goss was the first to speak
saying

  if i cash in they must never know the
how of it one of todays gang got me
ive spoken of my money and the ranch i
own thats the ranch i bought they


adventure

think the former owner is lending it to
them

delouge threw up his head and his lips
twisted to one side in an ugly smile that dis-
closed some of his white teeth and asked-
why shouldnt they know its your
ranch

  miss ellis is sensitive she wouldnt
want to be beholden to me silly of course
but shes lived all her life in an eastern
village among the same type of people
shes a bit humiliated as it is so as long
as i jive and she stays on the ranch she will
never know

  delouges head sank and for a few min-
utes he seemed lost injiis meditations
finally he asked-

  you think you have a good chance to
get out of that fuss alive

  excellent assured goss

 - your gall exploded delouge

you seem to be honing mighty keen for
that fight

  you brought it to me and im ready
i dont hunt for trouble but i cant afford
to run away and always have it at my heels
well show down and one of us will take a
new hand tother will drop out of the game
keep your mouth shut or well settle
it right here in the road warned delouge
without raising his voice and he spurred his
horse into a furious gallop

  goss maintained his steady pace and saw
his opponent dwindle to a speck down the
road then disappear around a bend he
was jogging along regretting what was be-
fore him when he suddenly found the road
barred by delouge before he could speak
the southerner reined to one side so that
they were riding abreast and quietly ad-
vised 

  if youve bought a ranch for those two
children and if you hqve some money you
want to give them tote it to them yourself

im no-errand boy the young lady

said i was deadly to men i dont happen

to like i am deadly as- keep that

in the front of your mind and be careful
what you talk

  goss stared at him in perplexity and
finally requested-

  be so good as to hint just what subjects
i can safely mention

  the twisted face smoothed out and de-
spite the vicious scar became almost hand-
some as delouge replied

  such as-how long itll take me to make

texas and just where im likely to pick up
seth and snap

  i dont get your meaning i certainly
dont want to start a row till your legs all

right but-

  its as plain as your boots interrupted
delouge theres no fight between us
we had our duel when we took on three
apiece i bagged one and wounded two
one of your men got away unscratched i
won youre licked

  and for the first time goss heard de-
louge laugh in genuine amusement

chapter xi

goss tries a new game

having once turned his thoughts to
prospecting goss discovered he fa-
vored the idea for two years he had
lived in the gold camps and had felt rather
a pitying contempt for the miners rugged
efforts but now that he was believing his
profession was passing from fashion self-
respect demanded a shifting of his point of
view so he came to decide that placer
hunting and developing constituted the
greatest gamble on the continent

  many coloradans were beginning to think
the same eastern bankers having seen the
gold pouring in from western mines were
willing to take over mining properties they
prided themselves that by a mechanical
system of exactness and by working on a
larger scale they could show profits such as
the original owners never dreamed of the
result of this trend was to make the original
mine owners the most reckless and persistent
of all speculators

  all the towns were talking shop in-
numerable stories of fortunes cleaned up
over night by those who ceased to produce
and lived only to trade pueblo gossiped
as well as denver goss ears were filled
with financial coups that made gambling
gains appear as trifles

  he continued at the tables however al-
though the old zest was gone he had a
feeling that he was closing out an unim-
portant business preliniinary to sitting in
the one big game on the continent he
played as shrewdly as ever but with the
underlying thought of the golden adventure
awaiting him in the spring he made
pueblo his headquarters but now that
cards had ceased to be his obsession he
pards



picked his company more carefully in
pueblo he won a reputation for being erratic

  he would drop into allens or some simi-
lar resort and after looking about suddenly
announced he was not in the mood on
the other hand he made a trip to taos after
being told a man down there was a mighty
gambler the trip ate into his reserve fund
to the extent of a thousand dollars on the
whole his luck held good and his poker sense
grew even more astute after the taos trip
he ceased plunging plays and steadily in-
creased his winnings to something over five
thousand dollars all the while he lived
with his old-time generosity

  it was shortly after the taos trip that
jesse frazer visited pueblo having been
told much about goss by frank ellis he
looked him up goss called it home news
and was hungry to listen as long as frazer
would talk they used up a long evening
at tommy suttles in discussing brother and
sister and the prospects for making the
ranch pay

  theyre young and theyre smart enough
especially the girl declared frazer but
i take it they have no binding arrangement
as to occupying the ranch ancient days
is shiftless means well but he may show
up any time busted then theyd have him
on their hands if it wasnt for that id say
they could make a mighty fine profit out
of the place once they got crops in and were
outfitted with stock and the like

  ancient days will never bother them
they can have the ranch as long as they like
but thats just between you and me until
i say different said goss

  frazer gazed at him sharply and slowly
nodded his head and remarked

  good then they have a fine piece of
property to develope if they had some
money they could shorten up the time of
waiting i had to start without even a
house and plow with a stick

  im a great believer in short cuts said
goss

  he excused himself for a moment and
soon returned with a thousand dollars in
gold and gave the bag to frazer saying
you tell them that as a silent partner
im contributing a thousand for seed imple-
ments hens and hen house two or three
cows with a suitable shelter or whatever
your judgment finds they need most

  why thatll fix them up handsome
you must be mighty fond of them

  i scarcely know miss ellis im very
fond of frank i also consider it a good in-
vestment just so much the tables cant
ever take away from me said goss

  in january goss tired of pueblo or the
narrow routine of his vacation he rode
up to canon city and timed his journey
so as to pass the ranchhouse long before sun-
rise no smoke was rising from the chimney
and the occupants slept on little dreaming
he was so near he wanted to stop at least
long enough to speak to them a bit but he
put the temptation away and roughly in-
formed his horse

  none of that we were to keep clear of
them they must have their chance to
make their own play without us looking
over their shoulders but well drop in and
say howdy when we ride back

  on reaching canon city he put up his
horse and went to bed to make up his sleep
late in the afternoon he went forth to hunt
a big game and found it and played with
smashing success for half the night then
with the worst of luck until after sunrise
when he quit heavy-eyed and weary he
was but a few dollars ahead for all his tebor
and shrewdness at midnight he had been
nearly two thousand ahead

  in grim derision he told himself-

  could have made more by digging post-
holes

he spent much of the second
day sleeping and he was surprized
on awakening to find he was not
 impatient to get back to the table
this indifference annoyed him he be-
lieved it augured bad luck in a moody
frame of mind he went to halls place and
the moment he entered the saloon he was
repaid for making the trip whip king
with whip in hand was at the bar enter-
taining several men with more or less truth-
ful narratives

  on beholding goss he startled the group
by emitting a loud whoop then he rushed
on the gambler greeting him boisterously
and dragging him to the privacy of a corner

  hall told me you was down pueblo way
i was planning to go down and hunt you
up he began once they had the table and
drinks between them if this aint luck
then a circle of a horsehair lariat wont stop
a snake but you look a bit thinner or
older-darned if i know which hows
luck
ii

adventure

  so so no kick but perhaps i need
to lay off the game awhile dont hanker
for cards as i used to saw euclid here
three months ago know where he is
denver or back east place for crazy
folks is where he belongs growled whip
king he was in denver two weeks ago
that femer dispointed me saved him from
a mob after hed assayed a piece of grind-
stone to run a fortune in gold per ton and
picked him out for my work as a humdinger
he seemed to have such a way with him
make folks think he was simple and just
the kind to find out things i wanted to
know then all he did was to get caught
by injuns promised to meet me in cali-
fornia gulch and wandered off to be picked
up by injuns he told me all about your
doings among the utes as a detective he
aint worth a broken-legged steer

  detective gasped goss for once
shaken out of his composure

  whip king grinned and explained
ordnance department of the army of
the frontier hired me to round up some of
the cusses who was running off lots of stock
also them whore passing counterfeit money
running guns into texas and such tricks
you never knew how close young ellis came
to being snagged

  you a detective repeated goss
eights and aces wonder you didnt
arrest me and why didnt you arrest ellis
in denver

  maybe i should have but i wasnt
interested in who killed skillings he
oughter been killed long before and i
didnt believe the youngster did it but
if id believed he was working with skillings
in passing counterfeit money id a nabbed
him quick enough

  and euclid was working for you

  i thought he was grumbled whip
king he had spells when id swear he
was a jim-dandy for my work that fool
way of his would let him in anywhere but
he couldnt keep his eyes on the wagon rut
too much dreaming so he quit and ive
shifted over to work for the quartermaster of
the denver post i shouldnt be breathing a
word of this to you but sometimes i feel
ill bust if i dont tell some one something
and i know youre close-mouthed just now
im keen to find vince moore bill waggle
and black bill theyre wanted for lifting
stock and passing bogus money running
guns south and a few other things

  its plain you havent been asking many
questions here in canon mused goss

  just been old whip king about to take
a wagon train back to the river chuckled
whip king

  the affair has been kept mighty quiet
continued goss their friends havent
made a yip and my friends havent moore
is probably in old mexico he headed for
there if you trail the two bills till you find
them youll have to ride about eight miles
down the valley and turn in from the road
with their boots on

  then he satisfied whip kings consum-
ing curiosity by recounting the fight at the
ranch

  life andgrief exclaimed whip king
softly pounding his big fist on the table
why nathan you oughter be hired by the
quartermaster to just go round and kill off
bad characters look here nathan you
come with me well be a team with an
ugly dog under the wagon

  no its good work and must be done
but i wouldnt like it refused goss just
now im thinking of taking a whack at
placer mining

  placer-mining bah its seen its best
days if you hanker to git into that you
should a started two years ago when you
was playing the different camps besides
it aint your game youll just cut open a
dog if you try it and end up by waiting on
some ones grub table like young ellis
did

  i think i shall try it if i have bad luck
i can at least say im a miner and gambler
when folks ask whats my business

  whip king slowly swallowed his drink
and conceded

  if it takes you out of the gambling busi-
ness itll be worth while even if you never
find anything except slate and cactus any-
way your news saves me a trip to pueblo
which i dont hanker to visit the last
time i was there the postmaster had set a
barrel of mail out in the road to show he had
quit only difference between quitting and
holding the job was about ten feet when
postmaster he dumped the mail on the floor
of his shebang and left it for folks to paw
over and take what they wanted when he
quit he moved it into the road

  now what about frank ellis are they
still looking for him asked goss

  land no some rumpus when he didnt
show up to testify against that leaper had
pards

us

to let leaper go he went up north now
hes forgotten

  he can go back to denver anytime and
no one will bother him

  goss did not show much elation at this
pipxf news ill tell him when i ride
dcron the valley he simply said he and
his sister will be glad to pull out i believe
as to prospecting its largely a notion i
maynt think well of it when the season
opens getting so im about sick of every-
thing

  you come along with me urged whip
king i can dish up more excitement for
you in a day than youll find in a year at the
card table or in hunting for the gold that
aint there fighting corral all the time
heads to the center since i saw you last
ive been in places thats worsen the bite
of a platte mosquito and one of them can
kill a mule game on tonight i might
sit in and how long are you stopping
here

  im riding early in the morning whip
king if i change my mind and want to
join you ill look you up as to a game im
feeling out of luck just now

   whip king laughed loudly and jeered

  out of luck dont feel like playing
why time it gits dark youll refuse a hand
just like the wind will stop whistling over
pikes peak but for profit and from a busi-
ness point of view itll pay you better to rob
stages im inclined to think id rather take
my chance at holding up a stage than to
know that sometime id be a broken-down
gambler

   he rose and goss got to his feet and with a
nod made for the door

   see you tonight whip king called after
him

  they did not meet that night however
as goss retired early and was in the saddle
at sunrise he did much sober thinking as
he covered the six miles to the ranch for he
found he had something of a fight to wage
the elliss were remaining on the ranch
from fear for franks safety goss tried to
persuade himself the young man was better
off where he was than to be returning
penniless to the east once the girl knew
her brother stood in no danger she would be
quick to quit the territory

   montana hanged for robbing an indian agent rocka-
 fellows history of fremont co col

  the two were at breakfast when he rode
up to the door and cheerily called out he
barely had time to notice a long hen house
and a cow hovel beyond the horse corral
before brother and sister were out the door
to greet him

  hullo partner joyously saluted ellis
come in come in thanks to you weve
made a fine start

  the girl gave him her hand and boasted
all the fresh eggs you can eat not
common eggs but ranch eggs

  she appeared to be genuinely pleased to
see him and after they had entered the
house she proudly pointed to a blank-book
neatly made from wrapping paper and
invited

  accounts of the firm open to inspec-
tion look it over when youve eaten
mr frazer says this is a good business
proposition and that youll get your money
back with good interest so we accepted it
we had to accept it as he said he didnt
know where you were or how the money
could be returned he did the buying
for us

  thats fine its the one good invest-
ment i ever made heartily declared goss

  only trouble is the chance that ancient
may want the place back any time if we
could lease it for a term of years with the
privilege of buying wed feel safer spoke
up ellis

  ill guarantee ancient wont bother you
he hasnt any use for crops assured the
gambler well fix it to buy when the
times ripe

  youre to put no more money into the
ranch hastily interrupted the girl and
no more business talk till youve eaten
draw up a chair coffee is hot bacon
and eggs hot i do the cooking so you must
praise it

  goss ate with much gusto but had a poor
appetite for a man riding six miles to his
breakfast after he had finished he sud-
denly informed them

  frank isnt wanted for anything met
his and my friend called whip king at
canon city yesterday hes working for
the government at weeding out rascals from
the territory he says frank can go back
to denver go anywhere and that no one
will trouble him im mighty pleased to be
able to bring such good news

steam piracy

by r w knight

erhaps the most curious pictur-
esque and only attempt at steam
piracy was made by a mexican
boat the marquis de la habana
commanded by a mexican general in the
annals of history it is the only case of steam
piracy known

  a mexican general by the name of mira-
mon acting as the principal representative
of the mexican conservative party char-
tered at havanna the former slave ship
marquis de la habana

  the original plan of this mexican and his
friends was to land at vera cruz and bring
about a revolution a semi-annual affair in
that country

  unfortunately for miramon when his
steamer appeared off vera cruz and de-
clined to show the flag of any recognized
country the united states fleet then cruis-
ing in mexican waters forbade him to land
this unforeseen interference placed mira-
mon in a distressing situation he had but
little capital and his crew were already
clamoring for the generous wages promised
them

  however he or some other ingenious per-
son aboard brought forward a plan that
would easily make them wealthy with no
great risk to themselves

  their steamship the marquis de la ha-
bana was a boat of about six hundred tons
and armed with a modern brass rifled
twenty-four-pound pivot and one or two
old fashioned thirty-two-pounders a ship
so armed could easily carry out their plans
and make a speedy and successful exit

  their plan was to stop and plunder one of
the california treasure steamers carrying

large quantities of gold from california to
new york this was all before the building
of trans-continental railroads the gold
was shipped to panama from san francisco
by boart across the isthmus by rail to aspin-
wall from there to new york by one of
col vanderbilts side-wheel steamers
there were few ocean cables in those days
of i so that to broadcast the news and
trace the pirates would be a difficult task

  the crew of the habana eagerly accepted
the new standard offered them they
were at best the motley riffraff of the
southern ports

  but the fates were against them in
some way probably by treachery com-
mander jawis of the u s sloop-of-war
saratoga was informed of the plot he
immediately set forth in search of them

  on march th the saratoga sighted the
marquis de la habana anchored off point
anton lizordo miramon attempted to
escape was overtaken and ordered to sur-
render he answered by firing twice from
his pivot gun at this declaration of
hostilities the saratoga gave them a broad-
side the contest ended in a short while
miramon surrendering some twenty mex-
icans were killed and wounded many
escaped ashore in small boats

  the saratoga placed a prize crew aboard
the marquis de la habana and sent her to
new orleans as being a pirate on the high
seas

  it is doubtful if miramon and his con-
federates were jailed for general miramon
was later a staunch supporter of emperor
maximilian during his short reign in
mexico

         rkness lay on the face of the
waters still although far away
down in the east it was quite
bright at some considerable
distance an unseen ship was still showing
her lights which twinkled and glimmered
steadily from time to time a black form
like some great uncouth bat a cormorant
in point of fact flapped heavily seaward
over the mighty steady breathing heaves
that represented calm to the ocean in that
place from half a mile away or so where
the cliffs reared sheer a stupendous black
rampart to the seas and the mountains
tumbled down to the shore came deep cav-
ernous sullen gurglings moanings loud
thunders and awful long-drawn sighs as the
breakers broke in spume and lost them-
selves among the giant caves those were
the only sounds upon the face of the waters
and away from them a mighty silence the
all-pervading mysterious brooding silence
of the sea lay over all

  then suddenly so suddenly that a cormo-
rant passing in carelessly low flight at that
moment coughed out a quick hollow grunt
of terror the black glassy surface of the sea
broke in a glimmer of spray as there rose
and uprose as it were a column of marble
a great tapering torpedo-shaped living
shining body of ghostly white perhaps
twenty or it may have been twenty-two or
four or mpre feet long-but i dp not know
because no one was ever found who dare
measure it

  for a moment it hung there balanced

poised with the snarl and seethe of the
water falling from it all around ere with
an awful soulless yearning hungry sigh it
curved and in one superb rolling plunge
vanished from sight it was a grampus or
killer or officially the terrible and dread
orca gladiator-wolf of the seas

  there followed a pause of perhaps five
minutes and then going at extraordinary
speed a form glistening and wet like that
of some big fish but it was a porpoise really
shot literally from the surface into the air
curved hit the water again and vanished

  close behind it seething with the terrific
speed at which it cut the waves a high
straight simitar-like jet-black vertical fin
shot along the surface and vanished also
but instantly almost again the porpoise
broke into sight darted along the surface
with one last flurry and leaped for its life as
a huge blunt round smooth jet-black and
shining head with wicked perfectly cruel
little eyes no visible ears and only a long-
ish oval patch of spotless flashing white
behind its eyes to relieve its ebon hues shot
up beneath it with enormous mouth agape

  there was one single appalling clash as
the great jaws shut a spurt of blood the
mighty odd-shaped blunt head turned over
the high cutting back fin cut a little white
frill of foam upon the dark waves for a sec-
ond or two and-nothing

both creatures both beasts-for they
were animals or more strictly mammals
with hot blood in their veins and breathing
through their noses same as us for all their


svolves of the sea

fishy appearance-had vanished entirely

  one of them the porpoise had vanished
forever from this world for at a single snap
the black monster of the deep had eaten
him alive

  but he was not gone that monster for in
a minute he was up again and undulating
with a wonderful long swift switch-back
motion along the surface all twenty-odd
feet of him and then it was seen that he
was not all black but only black above
water-line and below water-line was white
with that wonderful whiteness which only
creatures of the sea know and with a curious
white fluke mark curving forward and up
behind the large rounded flippers

  he was in fact the grampus as indeed
his speed attested for few there are that
can match the wolf of the sea in speed on
the face of the deep

  he was heading inshore toward the tow-
ering cliffs and in a very few minutes as he
swerved and began to work his way along
the foot of them--only his high knife-like
back fin and the horizontally set not ver-
tically as in fishes flukes of his tail showing
above water-one began to guess why his
purpose was a bad one as the purpose of
the dread kilier always is

  the light was increasing slightly and one
or two gulls specters floating overhead had
begun to appear and here and there a little
black guillemot his wings whirring and
the white half-moon on them winking with
alternate exposure and eclipse was flying
low out to sea to dive and fish once a
snowy white fulmar petrel-that big cousin
of the little stormy petrel-poised ghost-
like and in dead silence above the tell-tale
high sharp back-fin cutting the water as its
owner hunted swiftly along

  even a back-fin can give expression it can
speak it seemed that menacing shark-
like upright pointed appendage spoke
it was evidently looking for something
hunting up and down like a wolf on a trail
for something it knew was there at any
rate that was the impression it gave and i
fancy the impression was right

  then suddenly it stopped and the great
rounded blunt head of its owner came up
with its gleaming white throat its white
patches behind the eyes then as the swell
lifted him the little wicked eyes of the
killer got a clear view of what was ahead

he beheld a big amphitheater-like inlet
among the cliffs several wet slabs of rock

lifted above the swell shining in the new
light and upon them lying lazily dozing
on their sides on their backs anyhow any

way except the orthodox one of the picture
books were perhaps a dozen common seals
another seal was in the water apparently
sound asleep coming up from and going
down to the bottom like a lemon pip in a
glass of lemon squash and another seal was
in the water playing with a bunch of sea-
weed like a kitten

  in the center of the picture was a great
bloated whiskered beast-great only if the
killer was not by-straight on end with
his enormous puffed muzzle pointing to
heaven bobbing like a bottle beside the
common seals he was a giant beside the
killer he was-not a giant

  the books say great gray seals off british
coasts run to six feet long but this blown
out creature would never see six feet again
although he must have been a great gray
seal

  in one swift glance the killer took in the
scene marked his prey the great gray seal
gave his peculiar sidelong roll and dived-

sounded

through the foggy green
depths still as if petrified lighted
only by a circle of dazzling gold
above the terrible killer hurled
his mighty bulk along in the form of a gi-
gantic luminous bubble a wonderful shad-
owy shooting hurtling shapeless some-
thing silent as all things under the sea are
silent-as death itself

  he reached the location under his prey
and curved up like some enormous flash
undulating always with body and horizon-
tally fluked tail in that method of swim-
ming peculiar to all the whale and dolphin
people his great rounded muzzle showed
for a moment above the surface and then
as he rolled over and darted down his big
flipper flashed-finning they call this-
in the sun he had missed the great
gray seal was not there

  ahead leading straight down to the
black mouth of a mighty cavern in the
cliffs a train of silver bubbles ran and they
were the track of his prey warned ap-
parently in some inexplicable way of his
presence he could follow him there if he
liked and he did not like no pounding
about by breakers in spiky sea grottos for
him he was too big for that
wolves of the sea

   without a fraction of a seconds pause he
swerved and with amazing speed that he
had never checked in fact dashed to the
mouth of the inlet shooting straight across
it a cod like a blob of light streaked with
a silver flash as it turned from his path a
cormorant diving for breakfast darted off
at a tangent like a magnified black pearl
and then a luminous green bottle-at least
it looked like that but it was a seal-went
down as a shooting star falls below him

   then it was seen what is the full meaning
of the speed of the killer in the water the
huge expressionless animal merely quick-
ened the undulations of his tail and of his
whole body simply switch-backed the more
violently through the mysterious still cold
green underworld and he literally flew
along so that the speed of the seal-and
that same seal had hunted down a salmon
mark you in fair chase not an hour before-
seemed pitifully inadequate before him

  but how can i describe to you how that
poor hunted seal dodged how flashed how
turned how darted only in the end to be
remorselessly overtaken for the tenth time
and engulfed in one awful chop of the great
jaws then there was-well only the half
of a seal sinking to the bottom a second
chop and there was no seal at all

  after that the wolf of the seas headed
steadily out to the offing till when about a
quarter of a mile out he was joined first by
one then another then other killers rising
mysteriously simply from nowhere and
falling in his wake spouting and blowing
like jets of vapor in the cold air as their
great leader for leader he appeared to be
taking no more notice of them-horribly
expressionless creatures they are-than if
they had been bits of floating seaweed
headed steadily northwest

  there were eight killers in that herd
they call it herd but that is an absurd
term and pack would be better some were
about thirteen some fifteen one twenty
-and the great old leader over twenty feet
long apparently they had sent their lead-
er in to beat prey away from the rocks for
them apparently but what was the real
truth i do not pretend to know

   the pack now traveled swiftly and fairly
straight either undulating through and
over the waves more or less on view or else
just below the surface when only their
high sharp shark-like back-fins showed
occasionally the whole pack would sound

and go down still undulating always undu-
lating in fact so far as i could see so that
it seemed practically their only motion and
gave them a strange appearance of having
arms imprisoned and of taking part as it
were in a perpetual sack race

  this appearance of being enclosed in a
sack and of ceaselessly struggling to get out
of it is characteristic of these wonderful fish
who are not fish who with their limbs for-
ever imprisoned in their own skin yet out-
swim the very fish themselves

  as for the seals they are quite different
of course

  when the pack went down in this way it
scattered and there invariably followed a
great commotion and silvery flashing and
darting of fish each killer then chased
what it could on its own for a minute or two
snapping up great cod flounder and halibut
many pounds in weight as if they were but
a mouthful which they were but invariably
returning to the surface again to fall each
into his allotted place in the line of the pack
to continue the steady swift northward
journey

  once they came into a mighty sound
booming and thundering over the pathless
deep as if warships were carrying out big
gun practise there or as if a gigantic land-
slide were taking place somewhere unseen
so tremendous were the colossal roaring
sounds that the human ear even which is
comparatively dull would have heard them
plainly several miles away and the killers
apparently heard them farther or quite as
far

  naturally one expected them to give the
vicinity of that stupendous booming their
entire room but strangely enough they did
not on the contrary in fact the old lead-
er swung his great round nose round till it
was pointing direct west-northwest which
is to say straight toward the din and he
headed in that direction followed by the
rest at speed-if not at full speed for i
do not know whatever full speed a killer is
capable of putting up

  swiftly therefore they came up to the
uproar which at close quarters was deafen-
ing and no wonder for there before
them alone with nature and stupendous
was a school of whales leaping high and
straight clear out of the water into the air
and falling back with a thunder and up-
heaval that shook the very air and well
those whales did not measure more than


adventure

between sixty and seventy feet long most
likely

  it was nothing to them this hurling of
sixty-five feet of blubber skin and bone
weighing heaven alone knows how many
tons high into the air with the agility and
abandon of a salmon

  it was nothing to the killers they saw
that the whales were common rorquals or
fin-whales and that there were plenty of
them so they sheered off and left them
alone rorquals being mighty active beasts
not so inclined to surrender to fate and their
enemies as most but to us the phenom-
enon seems wonderful enough

once too about two hours la-
ter they came upon four seals-
fall-outs from a big traveling
herd-swimming together the
seals went straight away often getting along
over the surface like a thrown pebble play-
ing ducks and drakes and at really amaz-
ing speed and twice they dived to an
enormous depth but they had not such
thick oily blubber to withstand the great
cold and greater pressure as the relentlessly
pursuing killers had and were forced to
come up in the end therefore they
scattered as their last chance and two of
them leaping high again and again like
pursued fish in desperation were swum
down and tom to pieces by the ravenous
wolves of the sea

  once also but that was way along
toward the afternoon-for time did not
seem to count with these emotionless beasts
that traveled and traveled like so many
engines a peculiarity of their tribes and a
habit they were doomed to from birth to
death-once also i say the air began
gradually to get colder it had not been
anything within reach of warm anyway
but now it began to get cruel and nobody
seemed to feel surprized when there opened
up towering and glistening white blue
tremendous and indescribably mysterious
an iceberg

  the old leader of the killers directly the
cold in air and water warned him had
altered course toward it and now he was
taking a hungry view of the wonder from
the top of every swell he crested it was
some iceberg too

  a nearer inspection and a careful scout
round two sides of the dazzling walls-oh
that bitter water and that knife-like blast-

revealed to him the fact that the berg was
inhabited by three polar bears and a dozen
or two gulls it had evidently but lately
broken away from pack-ice off a land prom-
ontory and would soon strand off another
no doubt and some of the pack ice lay float-
ing close by and upon that pack ice were
twenty and one seals

  at least there were twenty-and-one seals
when the old killer and his gang-repre-
sented solely by warning high pointed
back-fins-first appeared out of the depths
one of the bears however essayed a beau-
tiful stalk upon the seals of the pack ice
and swimming across mostly under water
captured one neatly he was returning to
the berg with his prize when things went
wrong and events began to happen some-
how

  the knowing seals suddenly trailed past
him in mad panic going like the wind all
but four who wisely pulled out on to the ice
at once and he after one look below the
the surface swam for that iceberg as he had
seldom swum before

  he reached the iceberg all right moving
at a great rate with the peculiar round nose
of the old killer a dozen yards behind his
apology for a tail also he began to
scramble up was scrambling up in fact
and had to all intents and purposes got
beyond possible argument when the great
black and gleaming nose of the killer shot
up and heaving his great body on end with
one ponderous convulsive spring grabbed
the bear by one hind leg

  now polar bears do not admit suzerainty
where they live and this bear was a big one
also the polar bear is about the biggest
proposition in the claw and tooth fine of all
the bears

  there followed an awful roaring growling
wrenching tearing splashing inferno as
the bear fighting as only a polar bear can
every inch of the way came down slowly
sliding in a small avalanche of ice and snow
and a fog of spray what he might have
done single handed or pawed perhaps i
should say against the grampus is nothing
but guesswork-a big chunk out of the lat-
ters blubber and two red-hot claw scrapes
seemed to suggest that he would not have
died easily-but it did not matter anyway

  there was a gleaming flash of white a
snap an awful growling howl another of
equally gleaming black another snap an-
other and more awful growling howl that
wolves of the sea



represented two more killers rising on end
to help their leader then all vanished
together in one fearful churned-up froth-
ing red boil which lapped at the ice and
dissolved to a smother of pink foam which
calmed to bottle-green crimson - flecked
then one after the other the killers began
to come to the surface gripping chunks of
polar bear and diving again-lob tailing
they call it-for more

  an hour later the ominous pirate back-
fin of the big killer rose to and cut along
the surface far from the iceberg and alone
he was traveling very fast and with sug-
gestive purposefulness behind him a pink
streak dyed the jade green waves occasion-
ally the gap in his great cheeks which
the dying bears fangs had torn although
nothing to worry about to such a beast as
he was bleeding still somewhat and there
had been a tendency on the part of the next
largest grampus of the herd a twenty-foot
male to lead the others to turn upon him

  they would not have chanced it them-
selves at least not with one so strong and so
slightly injured only excited with blood
lust as they were at the moment this rival
for leadership of the herd-and incidental-
ly the possession of the pick of the killer
flappers-might have induced the rest to
back his attack

  wherefore the old grampus descending
suddenly like a stone to an enormous depth
had given them the slip in the pit-like black-
ness tremendous pressure and appalling
still cold down below and was heading now
northwestward alone hoping probably that
they were not following the blood trail and
keeping up a speed o knots till that same
blood trail should cease

  naturally he was not in the best of tem-
pers and of course he was hungry never
indeed have i known him when he was not
hungry and rarely in a sweet mood

        for one or both of these rea-
sons perhaps he turned from his
course half a point to investigate
a small sailing ship that lay all
sails set careening gaily away off between
him and the setting sun but she looked like
a cluster of rosy pearls a school of about
a dozen common long-beaked dolphins
were careering jovially round the shroud-
purpled bows of the ship-for your com-
mon dolphin is ever a companionable and
light-hearted creature-the largest of them

boasting perhaps seven and a half feet from
beak-tip to fluke tail-tip

  and it seemed to the killer that one of
these would be an altogether desirable
meal-or course rather-for though armed
with many teeth what is a six or seven foot
playful dolphin to the awful hunger fury of
a twenty-and-the-rest-foot killer

  the killer ceased to exist for a space till
he reappeared in the shape of that hated
dreaded perpendicular fin point-loathed
nearly wherever seas flow-hissing through
the bottle-green waves straight as a ruled
line toward an outlying or out-sporting
dolphin

  the dolphin breaching-leaping out of
the water-at that moment saw his doom
coming and promptly let out for the stern
of the ship sounding-just as a bird pursued
by a falcon towers to a height-to a good
depth as he went

  the killer followed and was too quick for
him though the terrific speed of the
killers hurtling rush beat even the torpedo-
like velocity of the dolphin and headed him
back to the surface where he breached again
only just in time to save himself from his
foes merciless chopping jaws

  the grampus was just about to breach
too when something happened which made
him round-roll to go down-with a
suddenness that set the water hissing be-
hind

  the whining song of a bullet passing close
above his head and the butting smacking
clap of a rifle report from the sailing vessel
came almost together

  now once long ago-goodness and him-
self alone know however long ago it must
have been-the old killer had been wound-
ed by a rifle bullet and he had never forgot-
ten the bang and the excruciating pain that
accompanied that episode he spun like
a top therefore and hurtled away head-
long only to charge all but full tilt into-
great flukes and mighty flippers what
in the name of father neptune himself was
this

  it seemed as if an island or half the sea-
bed or some little trifle of that kind had
chosen that moment to rise very suddenly
and very swiftly right smack under his
round nose it was not so much a mass it
was a mountain dark bluish gray shining
and alive	-

  the killer going astern and porting his
helm hard so to speak watched it come up


adventure

foot after foot yard after yard ten feet after
ten feet one twelve-foot monster that was
only a flipper of the miracle came up and
over sending him-him the big one mind
you-scuttling out of its way as it struck
the water with a crash that might have
scattered his brains

  the mighty greenland whale giant of
the frozen arctic the killer had seen and the
monster sperm or cachelot hugest thing
that grows out of the huge pacific he had
set eyes on but neither of these though
they dwarfed all else known showed tre-
mendous after the fashion of this stupendous
leviathan

  it was not a whale at all it was a super-
whale as a matter of fact though-what
a poky every-day little beggar fact is-it
rejoiced in the style and title full and
official of sibbalds whale-balcenoptera
sibbaldi-the sulfur-bottom of the whalers

  this conveys nothing of what the old
grampus saw rising monstrously above the
lapping swell there before him except that
whoever mr sibbald may have been his
discovery must have given him a won-
drous fright and made him wonder if his
brain was going in point of truth that old
grampus beheld lying there along the
green lapping water casting a far-reaching
and terrible shadow in the light of the set-
ting sun eighty-six and a half feet of whale
living and alive-eighty-six and one-half
english feet got it some animal aye

  the miracle had been following that ship
for twenty-one days goodness knows
what for perhaps to capsize her which
would have been bad and has been done
by smaller though great whales before
perhaps to make love to her-which would
have been a good deal worse i know not
nor did the captain and crew of the ship
they did not get nervous you understand
oh dear me no they only longed ardent-
ly for the absence of that living volcano
they even fired at it with a rifle-as the
old killer knew nearly to his cost-had
fired at it repeatedly but to no purpose
no of course not as well shoot a hippo-

potamus with an air gun and very much
more safely

  and it was at that awkward and precise
moment that the herd or school or pack or
whatever you please to call it of the killers
led by the rival twenty footer hot on the trail
of our wicked old friend chose to turn up

  the runaway old leader had no delusions
he turned rounded and went straight at the
white and gleaming belly-but it looked
green and neutral under water-of his foe
and that foe that rival taken a little by
surprize at the fury of his headlong rush
was forced to breach

  it was a pretty shot and killers are not
beloved even by sailormen the moun-
tain named after mr sibbald had made the
owner of the rifle a laughing stock and he
was only too glad to do some good with a
bullet or two the little projectile going
at something over a thousand feet per sec-
cond-that is to say just ahead of the
sound of the report that went with it-hit
the long gleaming column of the leaping
grampus fair on the side with a nasty thick
perfectly audible thtt

  then that killer heeled over and went
down in a cloud of spray just as the biggest
of all the whales began to round and spout
a vapory column as high it seemed as the
masts and the old killer went down with
his rival-down down down past green fog
and cod past twilight and cuttle-fish past
pale night and nameless shadows to black
black night nameless cold and gray-white
slime

and when the old killer even-
tually appeared once more upon
the seas surface he was alone
gory he was and fearful to look
upon but he was alone and fearless

  the mighty whale had sunk the herd of
killers were scattered chasing still more
scattered dolphins and there was nothing
on the seas or under the seas to prevent
the old reprobate of a killer from eloping
shoreward with the brightest hued and most
shapely of all the flapper killers which he did

unrise came into existence du-
ring those hectic days of mining
madness when the mere report of
one rich assay sufficed to mush-
room a town on to the map over night but
no town boom or otherwise can subsist
indefinitely upon a wildcat diet the rich
assay was never duplicated people left like
rats forsaking a leaky ship and sunrise was
doomed to a place among the ghost towns
of the west

  a few remained to take pot luck with the
bats rattlers and other denizens of the
desert in possession of crumbling shacks and
wind-swept streets some remained for
reasons purely sentimental-most certainly
not based upon good judgment others
lacked the funds to move with and others
too lazy to stir out in search of new diggings
followed the lines of least resistance in the
chairs on reagans saloon porch from morn-
ing till night all formed a little band of
hope and looked to colonel blevins for
council and leadership

  the colonel was sole owner editor and
general factotum of the desert lyre a sheet
which had been moved to and from and had
lied in half the boom camps of nevada
until now its few fonts of type and its clanky
old press fairly shuddered at the sight of a
desert freighter

  colonel blevins right to the title was
never fully explained unless by the gentle-
mans weakness for blending old bourbon
with the juice of crushed mint his southern
accent and in the absence of old bourbon

a somewhat truculent nature the in-
habitants let it go at that and asked no
question any man with those characteris-
tics has a perfect right to be addressed as
colonel 

  the slump caught him long on printing
supplies and short on cash too short to
consider moving he accepted the big
frog in the little puddle philosophy as his
excuse for remaining and tried to convince
himself and every one he came in contact
with that sunrise would be brought into the
fold of production but through the agency of
the desert lyre only

  he kicked sleepy wilsons dog out of the
line of march and paraded his two hundred
and odd pounds of pomposity up and down
the length of reagans saloon porch as
usual the colonel was in an oratorical mood

  gentle-men he said to the hopeful
and ever present assembly advertising-
the judicious application of printers ink
only will allay this civic decay the proud-
est day of my life will be when i can stand
here and point out countless tall hoisting-
frames dotting the skyline hear on every
hand stamp mills thundering out their
story of prosperity and be able to say
gentle-men see what the desert lyre
has done for sunrise 

  he spouted on for half an hour couching
the same sentiment in many phrases deep
down in his own mind he did not believe
one-tenth of what he said but he enjoyed
listening to himself and noting the expres-
sions of awe on the faces of his audience

adventure

  perspiration oozed from his forehead
ran down in a stream and dripped from the
end of a bulbous nose feeling the need
of additional moisture he strode inside fol-
lowed by the crowd where he disposed of a
brimming glassful of reagans best with
gulping effort and a shudder and inwardly
cursed the temporary dearth of mint in
sunrise

  bill trotter owner of the only remaining
assay office in town plucked at the colonels
sleeve and noddingly indicated a table and
empty chairs in the corner

  that advertising talk made a hit with
me colonel said bill after they were seated
with the table between them it gave me
a pippin of an idea

  the colonel smiled condescendingly

  it is the only method mistah trottah
by which pur vast unexplored area of min-
eral wealth can be brought to the notice of
moneyed men sah now with the desert

lyre-

  bill checked him

  never mind about the desert lyre
colonel ive heard that old spiel of yours
before i believe youd sing it if you had it
set to music im thinking seriously of
placing some advertising with you

  if bills rebuff had raised the colonels
ire the last words certainly allayed it the
colonel reared back against the wall
slapped his knee and beamed on the shifty-
eyed bill

  your ardor mistah trottah is highly
commendable would that we had more
of your kind in our indolent midst sah
more public-spirited citizens like yourself
sah welded into a unit and-er-backed by
the prestige of the desert lyre sah and

sunrise would-

  again bill checked him this time im-
patiently

  get me right colonel get me right

im not one-bit interested in the future

ofs sunrise what interests me is getting
out of here pronto im going to advertise
my place for sale

  the colonel brought his chair down from
a leaning position against the wall with a
bang he stiffened

  it pains me mistah trottah came
tinged with indignation to discover in you
an apostate a back-slider a traitor to our
civic cause sah

  he leaned forward shaking one pudgy
finger at bill and continued

  do you not realize that in the rehabili-
tation of sunrise an assay establishment is
a necessity i will say a necessity second
only to-er-the desert lyre

  bill grinned and tapped the old mans
arm

  keep your shirt on colonel dont get
all fussed up now im not like the rest
of these human buzzards in this town ive
got money to pay for my ad and i dont
want no ordinary little notice sandwiched
in between patent-medicine ads i want a
big display thatll make some sucker sit up
and take notice i want to sell and i want
to sell bad is what i mean

  he leaned closer to the colonel re-
duced his voice to a whisper and con-
tinued

  ill not only pay you regular rates but
you help me to put through any deal the ad
stirs and ill give you a good cut well
go in partners

  the colonels injured mien softened he
had a flexible mind one which circum-
stances could bend in any direction on short
notice he was mercenary and the sound
of a cash payment was as balm to an in-
jured ear

  well after all mistah trottah he
began with measured effort it might be for
the best your successah might be more
in accord with the progressive spirit of sun-
rise the change would certainly make
matters no worse sah

  after half an hour of low conversation in
which the colonels pencil and pad figured
largely they got up and headed for the bar
bill slapped the colonels back and whis-
pered-

  you break the news to them

  bill trotter was crafty with conscientious
scruples a minus quantity in his equation
he did not care so much about the ad in
the desert lyre but he did care about
having the colonel and the human buz-
zards he controlled as help in cinching a
sale when the sucker did arrive he had
a method in his apparent madness

  the colonel downed another drink and
faced the loungers

  gentle-men he began his announce-
ment it is with the deepest regret mis-
tah trottah informs me that owing to his
fast failing health he is forced to offer his
business for sale

  the colonel paused some one snick-
ered no one in the assembly had ever
the setting of sunrise



known bill trotter to be afflicted with any-
thing more than an abnormal appetite for
liquid refreshments

  now gentle-men mistah trottah has
long been a public benefactor in our midst
and it behooves us to give him our united
support in the disposal of his place the
exact manner in which you can aid will be
explained to you more thoroughly later
when-er-a possible purchaser arrives

  an hour later colonel blevins was busy
down in the desert lyre shack setting up
the largest display ad the paper had fea-
tured in many moons many of his old
subscription list had left forwarding ad-
dresses and the colonel still had hopes

          in a san francisco cellar in an
alley just off montgomery street
v jl dust-covered incandescents made
a feeble attempt at illumination
the combined fumes of nitric and hydro-
chloric acids and ammonia filled the air
chemical apparatus cluttered the shelves
and a hydrocarbon furnace roared in one
corner just out of heat range but close
enough to watch the volatile lead oxide curl-
ing up from cupels in the muffle sat lem
godfrey his attention was divided be-
tween the furnace and a newspaper spread
out on his knee

  lem hailed from somewhere back in the
green new england hills where he had been
raised in a puritanic atmosphere the prin-
ciples of which became with him no less of
a deep-seated religion than they had with
his straight-laced ancestors

  he had heard some wag say that gold was
so plentiful in the west it was necessary to
build high board fences around the islands
in san francisco bay to prevent the nuggets
from rolling into the water and obstructing
navigation

  lem never could see a joke it grew upon
him and eventually led him west where he
landed short on dollars but long on gullibility
unsophistication and puritanic principles

  one trip across the bay on a ferry running
close to angel island sufficed to throw his
dream into the discard bring him smack
up against cold cruel fact and the dire
necessity of rustling a job he went to
work in the acme laboratory where he
drudged studied and saved his money and
at the end of three years was a capable
assayer with a yearning to get away from
the city and its fogs

  the full page ad in the desert lyre
which some one had brought in wrapped
around an ore sample intrigued him an
assay office in a bustling mining district was
just what he wanted and that night he
wrote to wm trotter e m for more
particulars

  it pays to advertise mistah trottah
it pays to advertise sah in the desert
lyre remarked the colonel after reading
the second letter in two weeks from lemuel
godfrey to wm trotter he would have
gone on indefinitely in the same vein of en-
thusiasm had not bill stopped him

  never mind that old line of bunk colo-
nel our sucker will be in on the stage in
the morning and weve got to get busy at
something else beside singing the praises of
that old scandal sheet of yours

  but mistah trottah the colonel
blustered it is due the credit of getting
this man here

 sure it is but get on to yourself
aint we partners in this deal all right
then round up that flock of human scenery
you control and give them their instruc-
tions and as an incentive tell them if the
deal goes through ill give them a big blow-
out at lim sings pie foundry tomorrow
night

  bill put in the balance of the day at
cleaning up obsolete laboratory equipment
while the colonel perspired on reagans
porch haranguing and instilling into his
followers salesmanship kinks peculiarly
adapted to the disposal of assay offices in
defunct mining camps

  when the stage arrived next morning all
of sunrise was lined up to welcome its one
passenger andbefore an hour passed lem
began to think the cow that gave the milk of
human kindness was stabled in that town
but bill had no idea of leaving his prospect
to the tender mercies of his fellow towns-
men no not for one minute they all
had axes of their own to grind bill knew
it and took no chances as soon as lunch
was over he led lem away to the laboratory

  you see mr godfrey bill explained
im head over heels with work that ive
got to finish before you take hold-if you
decide to

  that afternoon business picked up amaz-
ingly in the trotter establishment its
volume exceeding that of any boom day
sleepy wilson baldy brooks dutch
fred and a dozen others who hadnt fingered


adventure

a cent of their own in months were flush with
cash to pay for assaying

  trotter impressed them several times in
a loud voice with the fact that he had always
done a cash business and refused to break
the rule on his last day in business lem
was also duly impressed as he sat at the
balances weighing and recording results
while bill labored over the furnace

  to lem the great number of rich ore
samples coming in from adjacent prospects
was amazing and he worked on through the
afternoon blinded by an impervious veil of
unsophistication

  near evening the colonel came puffing to
the back door and beckoned bill outside

  mistah trottah he began when they
had walked a short distance from the door
do you realize sah that i have sacrificed
my priceless collection of rich ore specimens
to insure the desired culmination of this
transaction sah

  well what of it bill asked puzzled
were partners aint we im putting
this outfit into the deal

  but i wish to impress upon you sah the
extreme necessity of closing the deal to-
night this-er-phenomenal business can
not be repeated tomorrow the rich ore is
exhausted sah

  bill was impatient to get back inside
well is that all old timer he asked
and turned as if to leave

  no sah it is not i find that the money
i advanced to our-er-agents-to lend
the desired atmosphere is not all being used
for that purpose messers wilson brooks
and others are becoming disgustingly in-
toxicated and dangerously talkative
dont worry colonel that suckers
hooked right now and youre sure of your
diwy i know thats whats eating you
by sundown hell have my name on the
dotted fine and ill have his money you
chase back and keep that bunch in rea-
gans get them so pickled they cant hit
the floor with their hats let alone talk

  the colonel left muttering and bill re-
turned to the assay office

hh long shadows were falling
across the ramshackle buildings
when bill closed the door pulled
the blinds and sat down to a table
with pen and ink before him a little later
lem folded the signed bill of sale and gave
a long appraising look at his new property

bill gave a sigh of relief counted the roll of
bills over and tucked them away in an in-
side pocket

  now young fellow he said icily let
me put you on to something in the assay
game that you didnt learn in the frisco
joint

  lems eyes widened the tone of voice
seemed to unveil a different wm trotter
than he had known before

  glad to have any advice you can give
was the simple answer

  when the birds in this town bring you
samples to assay give them big rich returns
no matter if the ore doesnt carry a trace of
value youve got to kid them to hold
their trade and to keep them from getting
mussy

  but i-i-i couldnt do that lem stam-
mered that would be dishonest-un-
ethical to say the least

  bill gave vent to a dry cackling laugh

  it might be one or the other of them at

that ive been here too- long to tell

the difference but take it from one who
knows its - good business in sun-
rise

  bill didnt hear lems further protesta-
tions a knock came at the rear door and
he hurried back to answer it it was the
colonel and in an anxious mood again
they walked out of hearing from within

  you can quit worrying now colonel
and make out the order for that mint julep
farm back in kentucky you been figuring
on ive got that sucker sold just as sure
as death and taxes

  has he paid you yet sah

  nope not yet was just getting out his
roll when you interrupted us you hurry
back and herd your cattle into lim sings
for the banquet and ill be trailing in with
the fatted calf in a little while

  bill watched the colonel until out of
sight then returned to lem

  lem started to renew his protest bill
headed him off

  that was the colonel he said
theyre giving a big feed up at lim sings
in your honor and the old man was naturally
anxious when you didnt show up we been
so busy today i forgot to tell you about it
and i told the colonel so

  big feed queried lem

  nothing else suppose you put on your
coat and hurry up there now sos not to
keep them waiting suggested bill itll
the setting of sunrise



take me a little while to muck the high-
grade off my hands and face and get into a
soup and nuts uniform-oh yes a few of the
best of us here wear them-and ill be
along in a little while

  lem did as suggested and walked slowly
toward town wondering what it was all
about never before had courtesy been
showered upon him as in the manner of
sunrise

  for several reasons the banquet was not
a success at the beginning lem offered
the colonel an affront by flatly refusing to
partake of punch which the old man had
concocted with pains from hard-rustled in-
gredients fully an hour later the colonel
merged from the peeved to the perspiringly
anxious condition when trotter failed to ap-
pear then as a fitting climax over half of
the guests did not get as far as nuts before
they were heads down on the table snoring
drunkenly the colonel stamped angrily
out of the door and lem followed anxious
to find trotter

  reagans was empty as they passed all
the trace they could find in the assay office
was some of bills old clothes on the floor
outside the colonel found fresh horse
tracks and wheel marks in the dust in front
of the door he back-tracked the vehicle to
mormon joes corral on the upper edge of
town and lem followed not knowing what
else to do

  joes boy informed them after being
hauled out of bed that his father had started
for the station nearly twenty miles away
about an hour before with trotter as a
passenger

  told dad he just had a message his wife
was dying in frisco an he wanted to catch
the limited the boy told them

  poor man said lem in all sincerity

  poor - lying scoundrel said the

colonel but to himself

  he now knew that trotter had pulled out
with the money and left him to hold the
sack

  the colonel faced a dilemma he could
not give that vent to the anger which nearly
every fiber in him demanded to do so
would be to reveal his own hand in the af-
fair pull down ridicule upon him and kill
his prestige in sunrise

  above all things his influence over his
followers must be preserved some day he
might need their weight to back him up in
some vital issue all those matters were

duly considered as he stood there in the
moonlight with lem close by wondering
just what ailed the eccentric colonel

       in the next few days no word
came of bill trotter and sunrise
dreamed on in its same old tenor
with the colonels oratory its chief
diversion his dissertations merged from
the old advertising theme to excerpts from a
treatise he said he was preparing on the ef-
fect of incompetent assayers upon strug-
gling mining communities the mere sight
of lem on the street was sufficient to launch
the colonel on one of his tirades lem was
an obnoxious reminder he was like a red rag
to a bull and the colonel resolved upon re-
moving him from sunrise

  the colonels undisguised attitude didnt
worry lem a great deal he had other mat-
ters to ponder over business had fallen
off to next to nothing what few samples
came in were charged on the book and
when the results were handed out never
failed to bring from the recipients such
compliments as thats rich ore an you
cant get anything out of it who told
you you could assay anyhow bill
trotter was the only man who could treat
our ores and many others in like vein

  trotters unethical advice often recurred
but lems puritanic principles overruled all
to the contrary

 gentle-men the colonel began
weightily i regret to note that sunrise
has made no forward strides in the last
month and it is wholly due to the incompe-
tence of mistah lemuel godfrey the as-
sayer self-preservation is the first law of
nature gentle-men and it pains me to sug-
gest that we impress upon him the advis-
ability of him leaving our community at
once

  ride the -faker out of town on a

rail one man suggested and similar cries
of violence went up from the crowd

  suppose before we do that proposed
jim hyde cautious and still unfired by the
mob attitude we run a dummy sample in
on him something were plumb sure aint
no good then if that proves him a four-
flusher give him the run but lets be sure
first

  it sounded good nearly all were in
favor of the plan

  but where gentle-men in this district
can we possibly find valueless rock queried


adventure

the colonel still hoping his original plan
would carry

  jim pulled a piece of rock from his pocket
and handed it around for inspection

  why its a whetstone exclaimed baldy
brooks

  it aint nothin else returned jim
when mormon joe moved away last week
he left an old grindstone i broke the darn
thing sharpenin my ax an put this piece in
my pocket for a whet rock what about
tryin mister assayer out with it there
aint a trace of mineral in a million tons
like it

  the suggestion was agreed upon sleepy
wilson reduced the rock to an unrecog-
nizable powder in a mortar wrapped the
sample in paper and started for lem god-
freys	x

  there mister see what you can melt out
of that said sleepy with a sneer as he
handed lem the sample i want the
straight goods this time or therell be some-
thin doing none of them wild guesses
like i been gettin on my ore

  id as soon youd take your work else-
where said lem i give you honest re-
sults and seem unable to satisfy

  mebbe you would as soon id take it
elsewhere but i aint a goin to ill be in
here tomorrow an youd better have it done
-an done rights what i mean the
miners of this town has had about enough of
your crooked work savvy

 sleepys attitude snapped lem out of his
half-hearted lethargical mood he grabbed
the sample up from the counter dumped it
into a pan and tagged it

  it will be ready at two tomorrow mr
wilson he said with a hitherto unused
frigidity

  ill give you a tip said sleepy before
leaving its from a darn rich ledge an i
know pretty near what itll run

  with that sleepy slammed the door

  that night lem went to bed weighted
with several problems his money was
about gone he had no business worthy of
the name and the people seemed all against
him he laid the colonels animosity to
having refused to drink the punch at the
banquet trotters advice came to him
he tried to crowd it out of mind but it
would pop back in

  he may have been right he admitted
reluctantly to himself the square ways
broke me now ill give them-oh heck

and he turned over to lose trouble in sleep

  next afternoon sleepy came for his re-
turns on the sample lem handed him the
certificate in an envelope

  i hope youll be satisfied with that
said lem with an ironical grin

  sleepy did not satisfy his curiosity until
on the way over to reagans

  he handed the paper to the colonel and
winked at the crowd the colonel read
and gave a long drawn whistle of surprize

 gentle-men my surmise has been
well founded this proves mistah godfrey
to be a base deceiver a faker of the dirtiest
water he waved the certificate this
certifies that momon joes old grindstone
runs one hundred and ten ounces and a frac-
tion in silver to the ton quite extro-
dinary gentle-men

  a laugh went up from the crowd then
came cries of lynch him later modified
to run him out and the citizens of sun-
rise went to the assay office in a body
headed by colonel blevins they crowded
through the door behind the colonel and
filled the space in front of the counter
lem met them smiling

  what can i do for you gentlemen he
asked

  mistah godfrey we have reached the
limits of patience and human endurance
sah

  the colonel shook the certificate in lems
face and thundered out

  do you mean to insult our intelligence
by telling us that old piece of a grindstone you
claim to have analyzed runs over one hun-
dred ounces in silver to the ton

  in spite of the gravity of the occasion
lem felt mildly amused he resolved to
stand pat

  old grindstone he asked

  yes sah sandstone probably quar-
ried back in the east sah and barren as a
hounds tooth sah

  i gave you the true result of my work
what else would you have me do

  get to-out of this town an do it

quick while youre able came from one in
the crowd

  they poured over the counter and lem
backed away menacing them with a pair of
tongs they jerked the tongs away from
him and rough hands pulled him through
the door jim hyde filled a canteen from
the water bucket and hung it over lems
shoulder
the setting of sunrise



   chances are youll need this before you
 get across the desert he said grimly to lem

   barely over a month before these same
men had welcomed him and dined him
now they escorted him to the edge of town
and warned him never to enter sunrise
again he smiled back at them

   did it occur to you gentlemen that you
 might some day regret this he asked and
 started out on to the desert

   that night lem stumbled blindly on in
the dark through sand and cactus

zrvjq after several months passed
and lem godfrey was forgotten
wejufff colonel blevins first truly felt his
throne tottering the desert lyre
had failed in producing results and was now
i openly scoffed at

   the best thing about that papers its
name remarked sleepy wilson that is
if you just listen thout lookin at the
spellin

   the offended colonel would have taken
issue then and there but for the arrival of a
stranger on horseback from the south he
dismounted in front of reagans

   whats the matter with this town he
asked are you all dead asleep or
crippled

   this town is far from being dead sah
 the colonel bristled

   well if you all aint dead asleep or

something how in - come you let a

bunch of chinamen locate the biggest bo-
nanza thats been struck since the com-
stock yes sir an right here in your
 yards almost

  rich strike close to sunrise the
whole country located by a gang of chinks
were among the queries shot at the stranger

   he pointed to a low chain of mountains
jutting like a long black finger into the des-
ert not over twenty miles to the south

   just came from there and take it from
 me its got old man midas pile lookin like

 a dirty deuce in a clean deck but the-is

a gang of chinks has got the whole -

 geography plastered with location notices
 soons the news gets out therell be some run
 in there im on my way out to rustle a
 saloon outfit to take in

   he entered reagans threw a gold piece
 on to the bar and called the crowd to join
 him but he had to drink alone for even
 then every man in sunrise was feverishly
 busy preparing for a trip

   

  four burros that had browsed for months
on juicy tomato-can labels back of lim
sings were hooked to an old rickety spring-
wagon loaded high with grub bed rolls
picks and shovels and the exodus was on

  the colonel was taken along for his le-
gal knowledge impressive eloquence and
shrewd sophistry too fat to make the
long walk he sat perched high on bed rolls
the only occupant of the wagon wielding a
long goad and vituperous tongue-the lat-
ter in masterly manner

  lim sing was given the choice of accom-
panying as an interpreter with promises of
a restaurant site in the new town if he went
or a violent death if he remained he
went

  youll be the only chink allowed in that
town lim they said this band of
free-born american citizens intends runnin

them - heathen countrymen of yours

plumb out of the country and takin that
which rightly belongs to us through virtue
of havin watched over this desert when the
rest of the whites deserted it

  every time the burros stopped to rest
which was often the colonel stood up high
on bed rolls and harangued the crowd along
lines of violence until every man there was
fully determined to jump those claims even
though it took killing to accomplish the end

  night came as they rounded the point and
started up a long gulch blasting from
above told them they were nearing their
destination farther up the gulch they
stopped sleepy wilson indicated the ridge
above them and several lights which seemed
to be shining through tent fabric a long
walk had dampened the ardor they had
started out with

  you and the chink go up and recon-
noiter colonel sleepy proposed the
rest of us is dead tired after the long hike
well rest till you come back if you need
help though just yell and well be there in a
bunch

  with reluctance the colonel made his
way through the dark up a rough hillside
forcing lim sing ahead of him he
stopped in front of the first tent and halooed
loudly he nudged lim sing in the ribs

  call to them in chinese lim he said
in shaky voice it may prevent them
from firing on us from ambush

  lim yelled something that sounded like
high low- and followed with other unin-
telligible jargon


adventure

  the flap of the nearest tent opened and
instead of a chinaman a bearded white man
stood in the entrance for a moment the
colonel was taken aback it made useless
the speech he had been rehearsing in mind
for lims interpretation

  good evening sah he said instead

  good evening colonel was the cheery
rejoinder

  the colonel rubbed his eyes brushed
memory and tried in every way to connect
a vague familiarity with some definite per-
son all efforts were in vain

  you have the best of me sah

  the man laughed

  three months beard is somewhat of a
disguise he said stroking it i left sun-
rise rather hurriedly and neglected bringing
my razor

  colonel blevins felt a sinking sensation
his knees shook and he turned to see if his
comrades were within easy call lim sing
took advantage of the colonels moment of
discomfiture to slip away

  mistah lemuel godfrey gasped the
colonel

  no one else lem replied smiling
after leaving sunrise i wandered around
lost on the desert two days later i was
picked up unconscious by several china-
men who were chopping sage brush on con-
tract for the desert queen mill they
nursed me back to health and i made one
more hand in their chopping gang

  lem paused to toss an empty box to the
colonel who was swaying rather uncer-
tainly

  sit down colonel take it easy he
said then went on one day when com-
plaining about my dull ax a teamster told
me that mormon joe had a grindstone
quarry in the near-by hills and naturally
i investigated i found a streak in the de-
posit that ran far higher than that which i
assayed for you you remember the sam-
ple dont you colonel

  the colonel nodded feebly but said not
a word

  i brought my chinese friends over here
to work for me and share liberally in my
find as they are not eligible to locate it
was all done in my name i located thirty
claims adjacent to the discovery and now
hold that which i am sure is every foot of
the mineralized area there is nothing
left for outsiders

  the last statement rubbed the colonel

the wrong way it raised a slight sem-
blance of his old bravado and he remem-
bered how he and his crowd had handled
this unsophisticated youth as they liked

  and now i presume you think your
hour of triumph has arrived said the
colonel bolstered by the sight of his friends
moving around a hastily built brush fire in
the gulch below

  i do lem replied with a smile and not
a trace of malice

  and do you think sah that my little
band of pioneers- the colonel laid particu-
lar emphasis on the word my-who have
starved labored and suffered trying to
bring this part of the desert to the notice of
capital sah are going to sit idly by and see it
usurped by a bunch of heathen chinese
sah you certainly have not forgotten our
concerted determination in one mattah we
at least thought we were right in sah

a rolling stone attracted the
colonels attention he looked
up to see six grinning chinese
in the rocks-above each was
armed with a pistol rifle or shotgun
lim sing made a seventh tightly cling-
ing to an ax

  lem waved them back to their tent

  everythings all right boys he told
them i can handle this perfectly myself

  the chinese slipped away and the colo-
nel wondered how this man godfrey thought
he could handle twenty-one determined
men lem smiled aggravatingly

  no colonel i have not forgotten the
mere thought of having wandered two days
beneath a relentless sun my lips parched
and bleeding my tongue protruding swollen
from my mouth and all the tortures of a hell
on earth thrust upon me are sufficient to
keep the instance you refer to forever in
mind

  the colonel winced patting the ground
nervously with one foot lem got it and
smiled all the more he seemed to like
holding the colonel in the torture chamber
of his own conscience

  and the more ive revolved the cir-
cumstances in mind lately the more ive
determined to pay every one for their part
in them lem said with a scathing coolness

  the colonel rose to his feet

  you-er-seem to forget sah that i am
the leader of a band of men nearly three
times your strength sah
the setting of sunrise



  lem pushed the old man back to his seat
on the box

  i know your strength to a man ive
watched you with a pair of powerful glasses
almost from the moment you left sunrise
and hoping to meet you all on my own
ground i planned and brought about the
trip you made today

 the-you did sah

  i did a gracey the man who brought
the news to you this morning is a teamster
hauling ore for me i told him to spread
the glad tidings in sunrise on his way out
after bill trotter

  mistah trottah is in san francisco
sah	

  the colonel didnt know what else to
say and he just had to say something

  wrong again colonel after bilking
me and incidentally your shrewd self he
landed in sodaville and lost all in a poker
game i hear he is now there acting as
dishwasher in a restaurant and of course it
pains me to learn of his reduced circum-
stances no doubt youll be overjoyed to
greet him tomorrow

  and why all this effort on your part
sah

  to bring about a reunion of old friends
and to pay them at least in part for their
participation in my affairs of the thirty
claims in my name six go to the chinese who
befriended me five to mormon joe thir-
teen to a company of sunrise citizens in
which it will be specifically understood
neither you nor trotter participate five to
myself and one to your good self and mr
trotter with a proviso that you work it
yourselves otherwise it reverts to me

  the night was cool but- the colonel per-
spired he started to expostulate lem
stopped him

  nothing will give me greater pleasure
colonel than to be instrumental in re-
establishing that association and friendship
which mr trotters fast-failing health in-
terrupted to be able to sit here and see both
of you working harmoniously together
now its getting late and youd better run
down and break the news to the others
good night

  without a word the colonel got up and
worked his way slowly down the hill half-
way down he stopped to rest and think
things over it was a knotty problem
he decided upon the only plan he thought
left open and continued on to the fire in the
gulch not knowing that lem followed curi-
ously a short distance behind 

  gentle-men he began in his old man-
ner welcome to the new camp of grind-
stone

  why grindstone from the crowd

  he went on to tell them of its discovery

  and gentle-men you have the desert
lyre to thank for bringing mistah godfrey
into the country and making this discovery
and you have its editor gentle-men to
thank for standing up for your rights and
demanding that mistah godfrey deed you a
fair share of the new find i had to sacrifice
both mine and mistah trottahs interests in
your behalf gentle-men but i did so un-
flinchingly with the same unselfish spirit
that has characterized all my dealings with
you

  lem listened smiling from behind a
near-by bush

  the leopard cant change his spots he
muttered and made his way up to the tent

  next morning sleepy rubbed his eyes and
gazed north over the desert

  well i guess sunrise has set but were
keepin on with our nose to grindstone

the sword comes

igmund the strong leaned
far over the table his blue eyes
glowing with strange fires the

 silver band that circled his mead-

horn snapped in the clutch of his thick
fingers but though the rough edge gashed
his thumb deep he felt it not nor did he
stir till his brother sigvard had nudged him
thrice with impatient force

  you do scant grace to the feast sigvard
reproached him are you drunk so soon

  sigmund laid one arm about his brothers
broad shoulders and drew his head close to
his own lips

   tis an ill feast he whispered that
smells more of blood than of beer this is
an evil day for the house of volsung

  sigvard laughed short and sharp as a
dog yelps

  now though you are my elder brother
he jeered i hold you no better than a fool
this an ill day-this which united our land
and our strength with the great power of
the gothic king our sister may think her-
self lucky to get such a husband as siggeir

  any prince in the north would boast of
such an honor as has been paid us in that so
mighty a folk should consent to make alli-
ance with us do the goths not number
three swords to every two that follow our
banner

sigmund scowled into his mead as if he

found it bitter then raising his eyes he
glared about him at his fathers boisterous
guests of the two hundred hard-fighting
hard-drinking warriors that made merry
with volsungs mead sigmund alone sat
silent and cheerless who would not have
called him as sigvard did an ill-natured
fool yet he knew himself for no fool and
the more he gazed at the bearded revellers
the grimmer grew his mood

  men will see you and think scorn of you
for an ungracious host sigvard urged
drink and be blithe see how our father
pledges his guests

  he pointed to the dais where volsung of
the high house sat enthroned with the great
king of the goths on his right hand sig-
mund following the pointing finger smiled
a bitter smile

  see what cheer our sister makes he
retorted little joy has she in this mar-
riage

  it was a fair sight for any man the little
group about the dais volsung king of the
eastmen of frakkland was worthy of his
fame as the greatest champion of the north
and father of the finest sons and the fairest
daughter within many days sail

  in his fiftieth year he was yet as lean his
great arms were as smoothly muscled as in
his youth his broad firm features bespoke
a matchless strength of will and pride of
heart to all his children he had given his
might of body his blond beauty and his
fierce soul

is


vengeance



  beside him the goth siggeir seemed
dwarfed though he was in truth no little
man in his early forties siggeir was tall
and well-shaped lithely erect of a becom-
ing dignity an empires ransom in gold
and rough gems-looted by his sire from
crumbling rome-gleamed on his sinewy
arms

  his brow was circled by a golden band
confining thick black locks as yet but
lightly touched with gray his face though
somewhat too shrewd was resolute the scar
that ran from one cheekbone into the
tangles of his swarthy beard added to the
manliness of his presence his eyes in-
spired confidence-till one looked long into
them

  king siggeir smiled at his fair bride as
she stood before him helping him to food
and drink no man could ask a lovelier
wife taller than most women she bore
herself with the stately grace of a valkyr
her golden hair gathered under a fillet
about her broad white brows fell in two
thick braids below her waist

  her mouth the firm wide mouth of her
father was set in a tight fine her fine nos-
trils dilated as she met her husbands smile
her blue eyes though steady were not the
eyes of a happy woman she gave one
glance to the bench where her brother sig-
mund sat he frowned again they were as
like these two as man and woman can be

  volsung rose with slow majesty his
massy golden horn upraised the noise of
drunken revelry was hushed the guests
sank back on their benches clasping their
brawny gold-decked arms a servant
brought fresh fuel for the fire-pits-though
it was midsummer an untimely frost made
the night keen-and the warriors cast back
their furred mantles showing their woolen
shirts

  let the horns be filled with ten-year
mead cried volsung and the women
waiting at the door thronged in passing
along the benches with their flagons till
every cup was full

  as became her signy herself daughter of
volsung and new-made wife of siggeir
served the two kings and the chief guests
these sat on a long bench that ran from the
dais athwart the nearest fire-pit on one side
of it sat the princes of frakkland volsungs
ten strong sons opposite them ten goths
chiefs of high repute

  as signy bent over her eldest brothers

shoulder sigmund whispered so low that
only she could hear-

  trust me my sister

  signy was a brave woman yet she trem-
bled a little and the mead gushed over
sigmunds hand and spilled upon the table
sigvard noticed and his eyes met his
brothers

        when all horns were brimming
        volsung spoke again

mj men of frakkland chiefs of
my people and ye noble goths
my guests drink a pledge with me by
the gift of my daughters hand to siggeir of
gothland foremost of kings i have bound
together the fates of the two noblest of
peoples drink with me to the weal and
glory of our nations and to the wedded joy
of king siggeir and his queen signy of the
house of volsung

  the warriors leaped to their feet the most
drunken sprawling over the benches in their
haste the firelight flashed on their golden
armlets the blackened rafters rang with
their shouts-

  siggeir siggeir and the house of
volsung

  their mead-horns tipped till the curved
ends pointed roofward poised and clashed
empty to the deal tables still they stood
roaring their applause till volsung seated
himself and siggeir rose

  he laughed as he came to his feet with
swift gestures he stripped the golden
spirals from his arms leaving them bare
broke the precious coils in his strong hands
and hurled them broadcast into the hall

  volsungs men sat quiet waiting for their
guests to have first chance at the largess
but the less disciplined goths-chiefs and
house-carls alike-sprang for the scattered
strips of gold their rush swept the
bronze dishes from the table knocked the
loose planks spinning from the trestles and
drenched the floor with spilled mead that
gushed hissing into the fire-pits

  they tumbled about the floor struggling
together to seize siggeirs bounty then as
the last glittering fragment was snatched up
they separated laughing the winners
pouched their spoil the losers ran back for
more drink there was nothing left for
volsungs men who sat ill-pleased

  house-carls set up the tables again long-
kirtled maids mopped up the floor and
bore fresh meat and drink to the sweating


adventure

warriors in high good humor the guests
settled down to their provender again

  pigs muttered sigvard

  hush-our brother speaks sigmund
admonished him there was savage irony
in his voice	rij

  the gothic king still stood gazing about
the wide hall whose splendor had given
volsung his surname higher and greater
than any other dwelling from the saxon
coast to the polar ice it was hung with
painted high-bossed shields and gleaming
weapons bands of gold adorned its pillars
the hides of slain bears and wolves hung
from its smoky rafters

  and in the midst of it towered the mighty
trunk where its master worshipped-the
branstock a huge oak with the majesty of
centuries upon it the hall had been built
around the tree the trimmed branches pro-
jected through the roof and a fringe of
shoots sprouting from its flanks obscured the
opening

  in summer these shoots were green with
leaves for the roots were kept watered
well back from it on each side the fire-pits
ran to within five paces of the bench-rows
that extended along the narrower sides of
the building and all along its rear save
where a door gave on the bower and
kitchens

  from the stately branstock siggeirs eyes
roved to the bench where the sons of vol-
sung sat and met sigmunds hostile glare
almost too swiftly to be seen the goths
eyes narrowed and widened again yet sig-
mund saw and smiled his thin-lipped smile

  siggeir lifted his horn his rich mel-
low voice was lower than volsungs and
pleasanter

  kind have the gods been to me he
spoke solemnly in giving me to wife a
princess of the house of volsung the
strength of both our peoples is doubled by
this marriage more house-carls follow me
to battle and my shieldwall is greater than
volsungs but no men among my folk can
match with your champions nor are there
anywhere such warriors as the ten princes
the glorious sons of volsung whose valor is
so like their sires that men call them the
ten volsungs happy am i on this day
i drink to the eternal friendship of our
peoples

  he emptied his horn at a single draft the
feat of a mighty drinker the feasters
roared their applause none louder than the

sons of volsung only sigmund sat silent
nursing his anger

  why do you not show him respect
sigvard whispered

  it was ill done sigmund muttered to
give our sister to a man she does not love
didst thou see how she spilled the ale when
she poured for us

  the confusion of a new-wed maid
sigvard scoffed i set no store by your
croakings no man has a stronger arm
than you but the gods gave you small wit
for soothsaying because signy was born
at one birth with you you were ever fool-
ishly anxious for her

  our sister is not the woman to be fright-
ened by a husband sigmund growled
there is something under all this which i
like not signy is a wise woman who sees
deeper than most

  none heeded him all mens faces were
buried in their mead-homs while they
drank volsung his vast frame comfortably
relaxed in the high seat spoke the happi-
ness he felt in his new alliance

  the gods have been good to me also
he said to his son-in-law ever have i
been devoted to them-chiefly to odin
whom i have worshipped at yonder oak
all the days of my reign never have i
left its trunk thirsty it has been bathed
in the blood of sacrifice and hung with
the shields of conquered princes for this
odin has given me prosperity-never more
richly than in this our compact of kinship
siggeir

  he had scarce spoken when he stiffened in
his seat staring in amazement siggeir fol-
lowed his glance and he too gaped and
rubbed his eyes as one who sees a vision
their followers felt the tension heads
turned over shoulders till every man in the
hall was gazing spell-bound at the great
door sigmund staring like the rest
turned once to catch his sisters eye and re-
coiled at the sight of her she stood with
one hand clutching her breast her strong
fine features pale and rigid ups parted
showing set white teeth

  a man stood in the doorway-a man none
had seen before the two house-carls on
guard strapping veterans in full armor
sought neither to hold nor to challenge
him they cringed with slack jaws and
trembling hands outthrust as if to ward
away some nameless terror filling the en-
trance from post to post shutting out the
vengeance



night with his monstrous bulk the stranger
waited speechless

  volsung recovered first never had he
shown fear of any man nor would he now

  hail and welcome whosoever thou art
he cried his voice ringing through the awed
silence clearer than a trumpet through the
shock of battle enter and taste our
cheer

   the stranger crossed the threshold stoop-
ing to pass that door through which a tall
man might stride with a hands breadth
clearance between its frame and the crest
of his helmet as he turned edgewise to
avoid striking the posts with his mighty
shoulders the light from the glowing fire-
pits and the fat pine torches fell full on him
and in the utter silence all started at the in-
drawn hiss of signys gasping breath

  the man was enormous of such a make
as the giants of old wives tales a white
beard tumbled over his vaulted chest and
hid his face to the eyes across his deep-
seamed brow fell a lock of white hair half-
hiding the dead socket of one eye the eye
that remained was full piercing flaming
with a blue fire that seemed to burn where
it rested

  none could see whether he wore mail or
no for a long blue mantle spread its folds
from chin to ankles he wore no sword-
belt nor carried any weapon in his mighty
hand wordless he stood his one eye
sweeping the hall one instant it rested on
siggeir and the goth hid his face

  then ignoring the two kings on the dais
the strange guest advanced in three mighty
strides to the holy oak the branstock
sacred to odin he stared upon it long and
earnestly nodding his head thrice then he
flung back his cloak and all saw that a
gleaming sword unscabbarded was passed
through his belt suddenly with a motion
the beholders could scarce follow he thrust
the blade deep into the branstocks bole
he turned then and facing the warriors
spoke for the first time

  whoso can pluck this sword from its
place he said-and his voice though low
and hollow filled the hall-shall have it as
a gift from me and he shall find that he
never lifted a better

  he strode toward the door but on the
very threshold he faced about his glowing
eye fixed on sigmund

  he who wins the sword shall have need
of it he spoke and was gone

it was long before the spell-
bound warriors could lift their
eyes from the door through which
he had vanished when they
did it was but to stare at the sword that
still quivered in the oak half its length
was buried in the tough wood the gems
that crusted its guards gleamed like angry
eyes

  a strange man and a strong cried
volsung and siggeir his lips white made
answer

  stranger and stronger than any man
should be my heart misgives me that this
is some trouble-breeder sent by enemies to
daunt us

  then signy spoke though a woman and
in the presence of men nor did any chide
her for she was reputed wiser than other
folk

  no man was that but a god it was
odins self and he comes for no good

  the warriors shuddered over their drink
only sigmund undaunted gazed with long-
ing eyes at the sword thus did each re-
spond to what befell in accordance with the
heart the gods had given him

  volsungs face shone uplifted by his
daughters words

  if my house has indeed been visited by
the father of gods he cried then is this
night a night of blessing and the sword will
prove a treasure to him who wins it thou
siggeir shalt try first both as my guest and
as the husband of my daughter such a
hero as thou must surely succeed

  siggeir sat motionless save for the trem-
bling of his hands his heart was cold with
superstitious fear he had not meant his
words concerning the stranger indeed he
believed signy right and that it was odin
himself who had appeared to them but
siggeir always said the reverse of what he
thought the better to fool men and in this
he usually succeeded yet though his
hands trembled his eyes glittered with
greed the firelight played on the im-
prisoned blade dyeing its blue sheen with
ominous red siggeir could scarce keep his
gaze off the jewels and the hilt chased with
gold the more he looked the more he
coveted the splendid weapon

  i will have it he cried and leaping
from the dais he ran to the branstock

  his right hand grasped the hilt he set one
foot against the bole the muscles of arm
and shoulder knotted under his close tunic


adventure

with all the power of back and body and legs
he strained till the sweat poured into his
eyes then he set his left hand below the
hilt and tried again but though he toiled
till his sinews cracked the sword did not
stir from its bed in the tough wood de-
feated his cheeks red with shame siggeir
walked back to the dais

  volsung signaled to the chief of siggeirs
bodyguard and the men of frakkland too
well trained to speak their anger aloud
glowered at the goths sigvard spoke for
them all when he said under his breath to
sigmund

  they must always have first chance
would my father but show less courtesy and
more justice

  this is but the beginning sigmund
answered bitterly

  the gothic captain swaggered up a
huge heavy-set man with limbs like the
very boughs of the branstock a little
gasp went up from every throat as he laid
hold of the hilt but though he strove
with savage strength his luck was as ill as
his lords

  one by one the gothic chieftains took
their turn and one by one they slunk back
to the benches sullen glaring about to see
if any laughed such was their mood that
trouble might easily spring up should vol-
sungs eastmen mock them but their
lords keen eye and the fear of his hand
kept these in check

  when all the guests had failed volsung
signed to sigmund his heir but sigmund
his eyes gleaming strangely shook his head
sigvard next of age rose and set his strong
young hands on the hilt but though the
least of the sons of volsung was mightier
than the mightiest among the goths neither
sigvard nor any other of the princes could
so much as stir the blade siggeirs eyes
glittered with a joy he could not hide if he
could not have the sword at least no other
should

  but the joy fled from his face when vol-
sung flung aside his cloak and advanced to
try his own vast strength in a land of
champions the king of frakkland still bore
the name of the most matchless among
heroes a confident smile lit his broad
fierce face as he closed his fingers about the
chased hilt and set himself for the pull
the smile vanished when his first powerful
heave failed again he tried and again
and at the third trial the blade stirred

  ha he cried and set himself for one

last triumphant wrench

  with all his might he threw himself back
his right foot thrusting against the tree
both hands locked tight and his arms
swelling till the muscles seemed to rebel
against the skin that prisoned them in
vain exhausted he drew back in disgust
and signed once more to sigmund

  the latter wavered but signy met his
glance with a compelling message in her
troubled eyes he looked about the hall
all eyes were on him his countrymens with
eager appeal the goths with ill-disguised
hostility he walked slowly seeming in-
different to the oak but signy read the
hope and pride and bitterness in his heart

  he struck his open palm against the hilt
as if in scorn and closed the fingers he
scorned to tug and wrestle as the others had
done he would not use both hands nor
brace his feet against the trunk one pull
he gave and the sword quitting its oaken
sheath with a rending noise came free in
his grasp

  the warriors stared dumfounded then a
great glad cry burst from the throats of the
eastmen the goths sat silent with hands
that itched for their weapons

  volsung looked upon his eldest son with a
flush of pride in the eyes of signy there
was a light both glad and stormy as for
siggeir it was a full minute before he could
master his emotion and for that minute his
soul stood unmasked but he had not dis-
sembled all his life for nothing

  astounded at his own success sigmund
gazed at the sword in his fingers then with
a burst of exultation that he could neither
understand nor control he swung the blade
in flashing circles about his head

  siggeir slunk down from the dais like a
wolf creeping on a dangerous prey blanch-
ing a little before the brandished sword he
laid a hand on sigmunds shoulder

  i am thy brother now he spoke softly
with the best smile he could command
wilt thou sell me the sword-for thrice its
weight in gold

  all sigmunds distrust and hate of the
man rose in his gorge

  thou didst try he answered bluntly
had it been thy lot to have the sword thou
wouldst have taken it from the oak but
since it was my hand that drew it out thou
shalt never have it-not though thou
wouldst offer me all the gold thou hast
vengeance



  siggeir nodded and smiled easily but
his teeth were clenched

  when the great folk had gone to bed the
house-carls talked it over among themselves
volsungs men stretched out on their fur-
covered benches in the hall and siggeirs in
the guest-rooms the goths blamed sig-
mund for what they deemed a shameful in-
sult to his guest and kinsman by marriage
and bragged of the way in which they would
avenge it if they were in siggeirs place
the eastmen were as certain that siggeir
had done foully in seeking to buy with gold
what a better man had won with his hands
but goth and eastman alike foresaw
trouble over the sword no matter what
sacred oaths the kinsmen might swear to
each other

chapter ii

the sword goes

	i he morning after the wedding-feast all
- men slept late their heads being heavy
with drink the sun was high when vol-
sung rose from his bed in the loft and as he
came down the stair into the court siggeir
and his wife were just leaving the bower

  a fair morning to you my son cried
volsung

  and to you my father the goth re-
turned heartily i pray you give com-
mand that my ship be made ready for the
weather is fair for our voyage home
volsung stared at him

  is this kindness he asked reproach-
fully what have i done to offend you
that you would leave me so soon i had
reckoned on a months visit at least
siggeir shook his head

  naught have you done amiss i am well
content with your hospitality but you
know the sea between this coast and goth-
land if we sail not while it is fair a sud-
den storm may overwhelm us my bride
is not used to foul weather

  volsung glanced at his daughter her
cheeks were flushed her eyes stony he
would have spoken to her but catching
sight of sigmund descending from the loft
she went to meet him

  if you could but stay a week- vol-
sung began but siggeir smiling refused

  thou shalt visit us instead at the end
of three months he said and i will make
amends for my lack of ceremony now

  as he spoke he glanced at his wife who

stood some ten paces distant talking with
her brother the distance was too great for
him to hear their words had he done so
he would have been ill pleased he turned
back to the bower leaving volsung to join
his children

  the old king marked his sons angry
face

  ill-omened are your looks my son he
reproved him for the last hour you may
see your sister

  sigmund started and laid a hand on his
fathers arm but it was signy who spoke

  an ill-omened husband have you given
me my father she cried i pray you
take me from him and send him home with
shame well i know that he plots mischief
against you

  volsung frowned

  you have said what no woman should
say of her husband what mean you

  signy glanced over her shoulder but the
bower door was shut and siggeir not to be
seen

  i could not sleep last night she an-
swered though i feigned to slumber sound
he tossed and twisted ever and anon i
heard him whisper give me vengeance
give me vengeance ye gods for this in-
sult 

  volsung looked hard at her and turned to
sigmund

  this is because you denied him the
sword his spirit will not endure being
bested by one so young but he will forget
when he is once busy with the cares of his
kingdom

  nay he will not forget signy cried
he is a snake that watches its time to
strike take me away from him my
father

  volsung considered deeply and at last
laid his hand gently on her shoulder

  if i do as you ask he made answer
siggeir will have a real grievance against
us and all men will say that i acted dis-
honorably toward him nay he is your
husband when he sails today you must go
with him

  sigmund scowled

  it is against all custom for a man to
leave his brides folks so soon after the wed-
ding-feast signy is right-there is evil in
this

  go to ye are but children volsung
chided them but his heart misgave him
lest they prove right


adventure

so siggeir sailed with his
wife and following from vol-
sungs port of ravenswick
great was the crowd that flocked
to see them off the gothic long-ship lay
under a long headland beneath which the
river had scooped a channel that gave deep
anchorage close to the bank the shores
were thronged with folk gaping farmers
with their women in gowns of scarlet green
and yellow gold-adorned ladies and house-
carls in gleaming mail volsung and his
sons stood on the pier with the pick of their
troops about them

  siggeirs oarsmen thrust out their long
blades to shove off the helmsman thrust his
weight against the steering-oar as the
ship swayed to the dip of the blades siggeir
standing on the poop waved a hand

  remember he called gaily ye must
visit us in three months time bring your
ten tall sons father volsung and such fol-
lowing of spears as may do you honor

 we will come volsung promised

  but his smile died for behind siggeir
stood signy her face dark with foreboding
as his eyes met hers signy shook her head
as if to urge her father not to make the
promised visit he made her a gesture of
farewell and turned away amid the
shouts of the sailors and the cheers of the
crowd the ship moved past the headland
caught the breeze and stood out with belly-
ing sail the oars were laid in the water
creamed beneath her forefoot

  the last volsung saw was the still figure
of his daughter looking back to her old home
and her kin heavily he returned to the hall

  but sigmund sat on the headland till the
light dimmed and the summer day merged
into the green pallor of the northern night
his face was stern and his fingers caressed
the edges of his strange-won sword from
the swelling coast-hills bulking dark in the
half-light a smell of trampled juniper
wafted to him across the estuary the
sun which would not drop below the hori-
zon till nigh midnight painted a few low
clouds an angry red they seemed to
pulse like the mouth of a throbbing wound

  sigmund looked from them to his sword

  ay there will be blood over this he
muttered now if it was indeed odin who
gave me this sword and not some malicious
troll or such a man as never before was
seen then may odin grant it may yet split
siggeirs heart

in the last gray before the
llvlr september dusk three white
specks took shape upon the sea
  and the wind falling there came
to the ears of the listening coastguard the
beat of many oars

  the three soldiers glanced at each other
we had best make sure first said one
it will go hard with us if we bear siggeir a
false tale

  and yet harder if we warn him not in
time another urged it can be none
other than volsung and his folk for it is
now three months since we left frakkland
and he gave his word to come what think
you radgeir

  the third a sinewy officer with a crafty
face spoke thoughtfully

  volsung was never known to break word
or appointment nor would he come with
but three ships unless he came in friend-
ship it is surely he let us speed with
the news that the king may have time to
gather his spears

  the three melted into the deepening
dusk riding south sparing not whip nor
spur

  the ships came on their sails now furled
oars chocking against the thwarts as the
dark drew in their looming sides grew
dim but as they dimmed they swelled
in bulk the stroke lessened plummets
splashed and the cries of the leadsmen rang
upon the night the water being deep off
the shelving rocks the three great craft
were cautiously stroked in sailors leaped
from the gunwales to the stony shore ropes
were tossed and the galleys made fast to
outcropping knobs of granite

  by twos and threes the crews sprang
ashore-three hundred men full-armed
their mail mantled in short cloaks when
a scant dozen remained aboard each dragon-
ship the lashings were cast off and the boats
stroked out into safer water

  the warriors gathered together waiting
for orders volsung and his ten sons drew
apart consulting in low tones

  it is passing strange said the king
that there is neither coastguard to chal-
lenge nor escort to receive us they knew
we would come 

  perchance siggeir has called in all his
men to prepare a mighty feast for us
sigvard suggested

  more like growled sigmund that he
has called them in for a worse purpose it
vengeance



were better to go aboard once more and
wait till day at least

  sigvard laughed scornfully

  had any other said that i should call it
a cowards counsel he jeered

  nay lads volsung chided them no
need for harsh words nor have we any-
thing to fear small gain would siggeir get
from treachery nor have we cause to expect
aught but friendship from him march

  at his command the house-carls fell into
column and struck inland with the long
strides of men who though they use the sea
dislike the confinement of ships scab-
bards clanked at their sides their shields
rang hollow on their mail

  we have not made the best landing
volsung observed here is no road but
the bare rock let us get this march over
as soon as we may

  the pace quickened and though here and
there a man stumbled over the rocky
ground they made good progress at last
they came to stubble fields where reaped
grain lay gathered in shocks as they
moved on a white figure edged like a ghost
from behind one of the larger shocks and
came out into the open in the very line of
advance

  volsung halted and the front-rank men
started back in fear

  a wraith one cried and a troll
echoed another

  but volsung who feared neither man nor
ghost strode to meet the apparition loosing
his sword as he went sigmund kept pace
with him but sigmund laid no hand on his
weapon

  when they were close to the dim figure
it ran to meet them arms outflung

  signy cried sigmund and his sister
fell into his embrace sobbing

  sigmund stroked her hair with rough
tenderness

  tears are not thy wont my sister he
said what ill news dost thou bear us

  the girl freed herself from him and seized
her fathers hand

  go back she cried her voice low but
vibrant with fear embark and sail hence
with all speed siggeir gathers his hosts
against you

  what mean you volsung questioned
how can my son-in-law plot harm against
me

  signy controlled her excitement forcing
herself to explain

  two hours ago a detail of the coastguard
came breathless to my husbands hall with
word that your ships were seen straight-
way siggeir sent for hi captains ordering
them to call up their men and fall upon you
on the plain north of the court slay all
was his command save the ten sons of
volsung them shall ye bring to me with
all their weapons

  you heard this yet he let you escape to
warn us

  i heard nothing signy answered i
was in the bower with my women one of
my maids is sister to siggeirs standard-
bearer he told her and she-who loves me
-bore the news at once to me i ran from
the bower through the court to the stables
there i well-nigh ran into a company of
spears but hidden by the dark i won a way
to the steading of a farmer who sold me a
horse for a gold bracelet he waits me
yonder now flee ere it be too late for my
husband has sworn to take your lives

  by the blood of odin sigmund swore
this is treachery of the blackest let us
return my father to our own land gather
every sword in frakkland and fall upon this
dog with fire and steel

  that is my counsel too signy urged
and take me with you i can not bear to
live with this murderer this betrayer of
kinsfolk this wolf of the wood

  volsung pondered while sigmund twisted
his hands with impatience and signy
plucked at her gown the younger sons of
volsung growled under their breath feeling
their weapons the while

  when volsung spoke at last his tones
were those of a man whose purpose is set and
can not be changed

  i am old he said and have never
learned to flee an hundred battles have i
fought most of them against hard odds and
always has the victory been mine now
that my life draws to its end i would fain
have it close as gloriously as it began nor
would i have the women say that my sons
showed their backs to a foe having come
hither we shall go hence with honor or not
at all and you my daughter shall go
home to your husband and be henceforth a
good wife to him

  signy met his eyes and read in them the
fate of her house her breath caught in a
sob quickly she seized her brother sig-
munds hands pressed them to her lips and
ran stumbling into the darkness then


adventure

came the sound of her horses jjoofs close at
first then dying slowly away

  forward cried volsung shields up
swords out

  the ranks closed the sound of many
blades slithering from their scabbards sent
an ominous whisper through the night

          siggeirs scouts too confident
announced volsungs approach
with loud shouts swiftly the old
hero brought his men to a halt
ordered them into wedge-formation and
strode along the ranks to make sure that
shield lapped shield in an unbroken phalanx
he had still time to take his place at the
point of the wedge his ten strong sons about
him ere the first shafts flew from the dark

  but the time thus given them was for no
kindly purpose nor from any heedlessness
of their foes even as they formed the
clink of metal all about them revealed that
gothic lines were encircling them and the
first arrow-flight burst upon the frakkland
wedge from all directions despite the
dark the archers could not miss so great a
target men dropped here and there the
ranks closing to fill their places

  volsungs reply was what it had ever been
-to meet numbers with strength and cun-
ning with valor

  break through he roared and his
compact ranks sprang to the charge

  gaining momentum as they rushed they
smashed through the gothic circle as light-
ning tears through rotten wood swords
flailing in front long spears thrusting from
the inner ranks they took such toll that the
extended gothic fine dared not stand be-
fore them once through-

  turn cried volsung back and
rend them

  the apex of the wedge became its rear-
ward angle each man pivoting where he
stood then swinging half-about to bring
one of the base-angles to the fore they
charged again this time it was not vol-
sung and his ten fierce sons but the erst-
while rearguard that formed the new point
of his assault stout men were these yet
not so stout as the eleven royal champions
and the work went more slowly nonethe-
less with savage fury they tore at siggeirs
line which had closed in solid before them
it stood between them and their ships and
they meant to win through at any cost
their long spears ripped through shield and

mail till the press grew too great then
pikes cast down they forced the fighting at
close grips with sword and ax back bent
siggeirs first line now thin and faint of
heart volsungs trumpet rang from the
rear and with renewed fury his house-carls
surged forward the goths broke-the red
wedge stumbled through

  to the shore cried volsung and on
the house-carls pressed teeth bared and
blades dripping

  but a second line now barred their way
flanking them with a never-ending stream
of swordsmen and lapping once more about
their rear

  they are weakest there sigmund
shouted to his father pointing over his
shoulder let us turn again cut through
their rear make for siggeirs walls and take
him as hostage against pursuit

  thou art rightl volsung answered and
gave the command

  twice he had broken through but he had
lost one man in ten this time the pivoting
of the wedge again brought the king and his
sons in the forefront their terrible blades
bore all before them irresistible they
flung the goths back tore their ranks
asunder opened a gap through which the
whole wedge thundered but even as they
won clear a countless mass of men rose up
from the ground before them-siggeirs re-
serves hidden by the blacker darkness in a
little fold of the ground

  the two forces clashed with an impetus
that sent both reeling but the more disci-
plined frakkland men recovered first
once more they drove the thin point of the
wedge through their foes and widened it
with the dense ranks behind a sudden
shock in their rear drove the wedge free
again but that shock-the massed attack
of the gothic main host-crumbled one
angle of the wedge and forced them to re-
form as they did so the foe they had
just broken closed their way again ere
volsung could utter a command their flanks
were crushed together by a well-timed
counter-attack from both sides

  four times more the dwindling eastmen
rallied struggled back to formation and
with their bloody wedge melting moment
by moment hacked their way through the
midst of their foes but the circle of steel
closed about them each time and vol-
sungs men wearied to exhaustion close-
pressed by new and fresh masses were
vengeance



driven to bay as a stag is ringed by the
wolf-pack the mounting moon showed
them hemmed in by at least two thousand
men

  the point of the wedge had borne the
brunt of battle though each man in the
little company had measured steel with
many foes four of volsungs sons could
scarce lift their shields all were red with
their own and others blood by strange
good fortune and through their own sur-
passing strength and the fineness of their
mail the princes still lived yet only
volsung himself and sigmund seemed un-
daunted sigmund fought with a ferocity
that even volsung could not match he
could scarce be restrained from leaving his
place in the wedge to leap headlong among
the enemy his wondrous sword bit
through mail and bone sending terror
through all that faced him and exulting in
its edge and his own hot young strength he
cut a red road for his kin to follow but
even his strong arm wearied with ceaseless
striking and his lungs fought for breath

  desperately volsung rallied his men so
bruised and weary that they could scarce
stand now that the moon rode high the
gothic arrows flew faster and found a surer
target the wedge melted where it stood
its ranks so torn that the shields no longer
lapped at all

  too late to win volsung shouted above
the tumult now die and die so that
gothland may remember you

  heaving up his red sword he sprang into
the thick of his foes sigmund at his side
wordless reeling the broken wedge stag-
gered forward for its final charge

  a well-aimed arrow sped through vol-
sungs throat he fell crashing before his
men screaming with rage sigmund leaped
to avenge him the wondrous sword
swung in his hand like the hammer of thor
with the red gods might behind it blade
could not parry it shield could not turn it
reckoning not whether one or a hundred of
his fathers house-carls followed sigmund
ravened along the gothic line till the hardiest
recoiled before him none dared face the
madman and his invincible blade till ringed
about with gothic dead sigmund stumbled
over the heaped corpses of his slain and
sprawled on his face the great sword flew
from his hand and the goths hurled them-
selves upon him

  it was the end through his more than

berserk might and the matchless temper of
his blade he had wrought such terror in the
goths that they had pulled down all that
was left of the wedge before they mastered
him of all who had sailed from frakkland
with volsung not one remained alive save
only volsungs sons these pulled down
by sheer weight were bound with new
ropes and dumped bleeding on the farthest
edge of the red field it was here that
siggeir came to judge them

  the gothic king had not exposed himself
in battle when all was done he rode up
on a fresh mount and smiled down upon the
beaten princes of all volsungs sons
only sigmund saw him the rest lay fainting
with exhaustion and loss of blood

  siggeir cocked one knee over his horses
neck and jeered sigmund trussed like a
fowl glared up at him and seeing his own
splendid sword in siggeirs hand his eyes
glowed with hate the goth spat in his
face

  i thank the gods siggeir spoke in
triumph that all my brothers-in-law live
there will still be enough feeling in them to
make it sport to hang them

  sigmund helpless spoke no word hang-
ing was the most shameful of all deaths but
he would not disgrace his blood by begging
for a better fate he bit his lip resolved
to have no speech with such a dog as
siggeir

  he could not see the stricken field with
its heaps of slain and the gallant pile of
dead that had been his fathers battered
shield-wall but he smiled grimly to think of
the lives he and his had taken ere they fell
it was shame that all the sons of volsung
had been captured when they might have
died but that was fate they had given a
good account of themselves and exacted a
fearful price from the foe he knew not
that siggeir had commanded them to be
taken alive wanting them to grace his gal-
lows perceiving that he did not know
this siggeir told him with bitter mockery
but sigmund paid him no heed

  the torn gothic ranks stirred and a
thousand faces lifted the sound of hoofs
behind him struck on sigmunds ears
then ere he guessed what it meant a hand
caressed his bleeding forehead and signys
voice rang clear above him

  a cowards- deed hast thou done my
husband yet because i am a woman and
thy wife it may be that thou wilt grant me


adventure

a gift thou owest it having treacher-
ously slain my father i do not ask my
brothers lives for i know thou fearest to
spare them i ask only that thou let them
live a fortnight that i may take them in
my arms yet a little while and so dull the
bitter edge of my grief this i ask for the
sake of the child i shall bear thee

  for a moment siggeir answered not then
he smiled cruelly

  thy prayer is granted he said the
more readily since it will grieve them the
more ho fellows bind the wounds of
these dogs give them food and drink and
set them in the stocks

  signy shrank back in horror hanging
was a foul death but to sit alive in stocks
was yet greater shame her eyes turned
imploringly to her husband but he laughed
and turned away

chapter iii

death from the forest

sigmund watched the moon climb over
the edge of the wood beyond the gothic
court as its yellow disk full and pulsing
thrust above the beech-tops he smiled
grimly the keen autumn frost bit his
bound arms and stiffened his wounds the
pain of them and of his throbbing wrists
and ankles was a little dulled by the cold
his legs after twenty hours in the stocks
felt like wood yet he smiled for he was
still alive still strong and so still dangerous
to his enemy

  the moonlight beat down on the slumped
bodies of his brothers whose gashed and
bloody legs protruded from the stocks in a
long row three of them were barely con-
scious though siggeir had had their hurts
washed and bound that they might live to
feel the shame of the halter the others
hung their heads and their breath came
hard and whistling as they strove to stir on
the rough log where they sat together

  sigvard looked up as the moon flashed in
his face

  you were right he muttered would
that we had heeded your warning now we
shall all die and wretchedly

  sigmund laughed

  mayhap but it is in my mind that our
sister did not ask a fortnights respite for us
merely that we might make sport for her
weasel of a husband

  what mean you we are helpless

  i think said sigmund signy will be
here ere the night is done you may be
sure she means to set us free once quit
of these bonds we may yet hope for ven-
geance

  sigvards eyes flashed

  if i thought that- but nay we are
too weak to flee far and all this land is
siggeirs how may we escape him at all
let alone for long enough to devise some
plan against him

  where is your courage sigmund re-
torted fiercely i ask but to be free and
i will make both the time and the means
for vengeance henceforth i live but to
wrest from siggeir full payment for our
fathers murder and our shame i know
my sister well enough to trust her-she is
volsungs daughter and will wage the
blood-feud against his slayer till siggeirs
ghost goes red to meet the ghost of volsung
i have watched this moon since its first rays
pierced between yonder trunks certain am
i that our sister will come before it sets
sigvard bent his aching head in a gesture
toward the farther end of the stocks

  there be three that can not flee though
we be released he objected sigling is
spent with loss of blood sigtrygg and sin-
tregi are cut to ribbons they are over-
weak to survive the perils of flight and
mayhap hunger while their wounds are yet
unhealed

  we will carry them sigmund retorted
his lips set in a grim line his eyes sparkled
frostily by odin i swear it come what
may come the children of volsung shall
yet wreak their hate on volsungs murderer

take heart then-

  - sigvards startled cry broke off his speech
following his brothers strained glance
sigmund saw on the edge of the forest a
dark shape flitting to and fro

  that is not signy he muttered
would it but come out into the moon-
light-

  he frowned anxiously striving to discern
what manner of thing it was which lurked
among the beech-trunks all his heart was
set on the rescue he expected and the ven-
geance to follow yet this flitting shadow was
not a human form nor would signy come
from that direction that she would come
he was sure

  the shape was hidden now in the forest
gloom long the brothers stared toward
vengeance



the spot where it had melted into the dark
then suddenly sigvard screamed

  from the sheer blackness it had sprung-
a long low streak that leaped toward them
with the swiftness of light as it shot from
the trees the quick touch of moonlight
turned it into a gray horror with flashing
teeth and slavering lips-a great gaunt
wolf

  sigmund tugged at his bonds with all
his mighty strength the writhing muscles
stood out on his straining shoulders and
thighs the wood of the stocks groaned with
his savage efforts to break free beside him
sigvard also wrenched and struggled but
he was weaker far than his brother as
sigmund threw himself back and forth in
mad unavailing efforts sigling his young-
est brother shrieked once terribly

  the youth bound at that end of the
log nearest the forest had waked to con-
sciousness with the wolfs hot breath on
his face the next instant his throat was
torn out

  the wolf with dripping jaws stood on
braced feet and looked once at the franti-
cally struggling sigmund then as if con-
temptuously sure of his helplessness it bent
to its ghastly feast sigmund his strength
spent sat with heaving flanks and face
dropping sweat while the sound of crunch-
ing jaws and cracking bones filled his soul
with horror

  sigvard turned sick but in sigmunds
face bitter and gaunt his eyes were living
coals

  for this also there shall be vengeance
he whispered

  morning came in a glory of red sun and
tingling air and with it came siggeir riding
up between two house-carls he ambled
past the row of his foes mocking them with
gibes and sneering laughter then he set
eyes on the bloody thing that had been
sigling and he burst into shouts of evil joy

  all the brothers were conscious now they
scowled at him sullenly - sigmund met his
eyes fairly and at sight of the hot fire in
sigmunds gaze the goth shivered but
the firm bonds on his enemys torn wrists
gave him confidence

  this is better than hanging them he
roared we will let them bide here till
one by one they fall to the wolf but lest
they lose strength and die easily they shall
be well fed ho ulf speed back for
meat and wine

  the house-carl rode off his lips twisting
in a wry grin

  siggeir dismounted in front of sigmund
the goths face had lost its assumed frank-
ness and was openly vile his loose mouth
writhed with mirth his cunning eyes
danced

  a brave death he jeered and a fine
burial in the maw of a foul beast verily
signy will rejoice to hear of this and the
beast will return lads till all of you are
done ha volsung had ten brave sons
now he has nine mayhap his ghost looked
on last night and saw his youngest child
torn into raw shreds so shall it be with
you all-all ho and it was thou sig-
mund that didst deny me a sword i have
that sword now- he clapped his palm
against his scabbard- nor shalt thou live
to win it back would it not have been
better hadst thou given it me

  sigmund answered not his eyes spoke for
him siggeir renewed his taunts

  signy would have come to you last
night but i caught her and dragged her
back she had a knife to cut your bonds
balm for your wounds and food-but ye
will not need it now look not for her to-
night for she will be under guard but if ye
look well ye shall see-the wolf

  he laughed again and leaped to the
saddle

  soon came ulf with food he placed the
meat and drink on the upper beam of the
stocks and going behind the brothers freed
their wrists one at a time sigvard would
have refused food but sigmund disregard-
ing the house-carl admonished him-
take all they will give that you may
gain strength against the hour of our re-
venge

  so they all ate and drank one at a time
till all had fed and been bound again then
ulf freed the legs of each for long enough to
let the blood flow well each stretched his
limbs and chafed one on the other though
their ankles throbbed and stung furiously
when they were made fast once more ulf
stood off and surveyed them sourly

strength to avenge he mocked nay
strength to feel the sharp fangs of the wolf
the day passed fresh and fair with the
flash of sunlight on the turning leaves and
night fell again

  that night the wolf came ere the moon
rose and sintregis soul went out between
its jaws


adventure

on the tenth night after the
full moon sigmund sat alone in
the stocks the beams were
bloodstained blood was splashed
on his legs and chest his young face was
seamed with lines of hate and anguish his
eyes burned with a fury nigh to madness
the flesh of his wrists and ankles was
mangled with his struggles yet each day
when food was brought he ate with savage
resolution

  the night before sigvard had been
taken his struggle had been terrible for
the meat he had eaten every day had
brought back his strength but strength
availed him nothing he was gone and
with him had gone the last of sigmunds
hope with utter desperation he had
fought to break his bonds and save his last
surviving brother he had failed tonight
it was his turn

  but though hope had fled determination
remained well he knew he must die that
night yet through clenched teeth he spat
his hate of siggeir

  though i die he snarled though the
wolf wet its teeth in the last of my blood
yet will i avenge

  that day siggeir had mocked him past
endurance and he had cried aloud his pas-
sion for vengeance his centered resolution
that come what might he would somehow
slay his enemy before he died himself
siggeir with a harsh laugh had pointed to
the bones of sigvard

  ten tall sons had volsung he mocked
now he has one and tonight they shall all
be with him among the ghosts

  now it was dark he was alone and
soon the wolf would come

  somewhere a twig cracked and sig-
munds heart gave an anguished leap but
the sound came not from the forest where
the wolf lurked it came from the plain be-
tween him and the court he turned his
head and stared was the beast creeping
up on him from an unwonted direction

  he heard the scrape of stealthy feet-
human feet-on gravel and a little pulse of
hope began to hammer in his brain a mo-
ment more and a white figure crept toward
him from the night

  signy he cried and with running feet
his sister came to him her arms white
against the darkness clasping his neck

  she kissed him twice her tears wet his
cheeks then she bent to his bound hands

  and strove to loose them her fingers were
strong for a womans but the knots would
not yield when she had plucked at them
in vain a while sigmund bade her cease

  i can feel he said that the cord is too
tight leave me else the wolf will kill you
be mindful of our vengeance sister in a
little while thou wilt be left alone of all the
children of volsung it is thou who must
avenge us all

  avenge you i will she answered with
such a fierce passion that even sigmund
who knew his sister marveled but i
will not go till i have done that for which i
came i drugged my guards and escaped
but i could not drug all those who sleep in
the hall or the servants in the kitchen
therefore i could not get knife or sword for
you even your bonds i can not loose
but i have brought that which may help you
when the wolf comes

  she drew something from her kirtle and
dipping her fingers in it began to smear his
face with sticky substance

  what is that he asked but as he spoke
a little of the stuff trickled into his mouth
it was honey

  i have heard she explained that
wild beasts love honey more than flesh
your hands are bound but your teeth are
free do you understand

  sigmund laughed savagely

  i do would that you might turn sig-
geir into a wolf

  if you live she said you will hear
from me again i must go now ere the
guards wake and miss me i would stay to
bide the issue with you but if you escape it
must not be known that i have helped you
i must be unsuspected if i am to serve you
later

  you speak wisely you and i were born
at one birth in soul as in feature we are
alike remember-each moment of your
life-that there is neither rest nor joy for us
till our father and our brothers are avenged
neither poison nor a knife in the back will
serve our purpose siggeir must see the
stroke that fells him must taste his death
in torture and shame

  signy laid her hands on his head
goods life honor she spoke solemnly
all that i have or am i will give for our
vengeance

  thou hast sworn now flee ere the
wolf comes

signy disappeared and sigmund waited
vengeance



for fate nor was his waiting pleasant so
highly was his spirit strung that the honey
smearing his face irked him more than fear
of the wolfs fangs it was with relief that
more than an hour after signys departure
he saw the flitting shadow that was the
beast gather for its spring

  in very mid-crouch it checked rose
stiff-legged and snuffed the air sigmund
waited tense and eager slowly nose up
and yellow eyes questing the wolf trotted
forward stopping every few steps to sniff
and glare suspiciously yet ever it came on
again as if fascinated at length it leaped
upon the upper beam of the stocks and
resting its hind feet there planted its fore-
paws on the doomed mans shoulders its
position was cramped for it was huge-a
great female with chest and shoulders big-
ger than any dog-wolf sigmund had ever
seen

  it bent its head toward him and as its
tongue touched his cheek the evil breath
of it stung his nostrils sigmunds muscles
quivered the beast began to lick the
honey from his face and he cursed the fate
that had deprived him of the use of his
hands

  the wolfs tongue touched his lips where
the honey was thickest and at the touch
sigmund opened his lips a little the hot
foul tongue of the monster rested one
moment on his then seeking the source of
the sweet stuff she thrust her tongue deep
within his mouth

  instantly sigmund closed his powerful
jaws his teeth clamping down on the warm
tongue with all his strength snorting with
pain the wolf heaved back her legs braced
hard against the beam of the stocks as
she reared sigmund threw back his mighty
shoulders lifting up as well as he could with
his imprisoned thighs his grip on the
beasts tongue tightened the wolf slavering
and whining struggled with savage fury
heaving even as she heaved sigmund
heard the braces of the stocks groan crack
and burst the last thrust of the wolfs
legs given even as he threw back once
more wrenched the upper beam aside and
flung it down

  with a strangled grunt of joy sigmund
slid to his feet but his legs cramped with
confinement crumpled under him yet his
teeth kept their hold though he rolled from
the log and fell heavily the wolf was
jerked down over him her tongue nearly torn

   

  from her mouth her claws tore at him
she strove in vain to free her jaws and bury
her fangs in his throat

  flat on the earth sigmund wrenched his
head to and fro the wolf hurling herself
backward in frantic attempts to tear free
at last her forepaws against his shoulders
she thrust mightly and broke loose but
she neither bit nor howled with drooped
head and tail between her legs she slunk
into the forest dripping blood from her
black lips and moaning sigmund un-
clenching his teeth cast her mangled tongue
aside and struggled to his tingling legs

  with swollen feet he felt about for a
sharp stone and stumbling over a jagged
bit of flint he lay down against it rubbing
his raw wrists on its edge it slipped and
moved so that he could not find it again
rising with an effort he stumbled about in
the dark till he struck against a great bould-
er and against this he chafed his bonds till
they fell apart

  paying no heed to his hurts he broke into
a lumbering run that bore him deep into the
forest he had no knowledge of the coun-
try again and again in the night he fell
heavily over stones or crashed into tree-
trunks yet ever he rose and ran on till the
night was far spent and he with it he lay
where he fell the last time and there morn-
ing found him

chapter iv

outcast

with the first light of day he was
up his wrists and ankles throbbing
with their untended hurts all about him
stretched a dense virgin forest of oak and
beech trees immeasurably old of mighty
girth that shut out the sun with their leaves
the ground was thick with fallen leaves and
mast

  at last he heard the sound of running
water and in a little while he splashed into
the bed of a clear stream he flung him-
self prone in it drinking till he was sated
and letting the cold water cleanse and
freshen his body then walking up-
stream he bathed his wounds this done
he pressed on again searching the forest all
about him with quick glances siggeirs
men would be on his track soon if they were
not already for siggeir dared not let him
live


adventure

  the forest seemed endless on and on he
hastened till his feet would scarce bear him
and his head grew hot with fever rest he
must have and that soon but first he must
find a safe place the forest seemed utterly
wild he saw no human soul nor the least
trace that the foot of man had ever passed
there about the stream had been beast-
tracks but no spoor of horses cattle or even
swine

  he came to rising ground thick-strewn
with boulders up he pressed thinking the
rough ground would give him the means
of dodging pursuit the trackless slope
was almost free from undergrowth so dense
was the foliage and so greedy the roots
of the great trees the hill grew ever
steeper till he was forced to climb on hands
and knees and to lift himself over huge
lumps of granite

  he brought up at last against a sheer
ledge down which a little from him water
poured with a sound of thunder he made
for the fall meaning to refresh himself with
the spray of its edges and when he came
near he saw with a thrill of joy that the
ledge under it was hollowed out so that a
man might pass between waterfall and
rock slipping between he found a little
below the level of his shoulders a cave

  with his last strength he hoisted himself
up and into its mouth to fall panting on
its floor it was long before he gained
energy enough to rise and search it

  the cave floor was almost level slanting
at first a little up then down its height
was somewhat more than a mans and its
breath a good ten feet without light
sigmund dared not go deeper in but he had
no need to for the present it was well
hidden and its floor was strewn with stones
that would serve for rough weapons

  he threw himself down to rest and to
wait the pursuit would not be long de-
layed siggeir would send men enough to
scour the wood from end to end sigmund
hoped they would come soon for he knew
what he had to do and wished it done

  one moment his nerves were tight
stretched listening for hoofbeats and the
the clang of mail the next he was asleep
how long he lay there he knew not but
when he woke still feverish but refreshed
a jumble of sounds rang in his ears the
shouts of men the clatter of weapons all
dimly confused and muffled by the fall of
the waters

  sigmund sprang up his hands fumbling
for a stone finding one both weighty and
sharp he slipped down from the cave-
mouth and peered from behind the screen
of falling water a shout rang close at
hand a mailed warrior leaped into view
pointing with his spear toward the ledge
the man had approached from the side and
had seen both the space between fall and
rock and the shadowy mouth of the cave

  sigmund hurled his stone full into the
house-carls face the goth fell his skull
shattered swiftly sigmund ran to him
stripped him of shield spear and sword and
glanced about for the next foe

  a cry of rage warned him barely in time
to spring aside from the swishing flight of a
spear two men-two only-were in sight
one an officer yelled an order at the other
who raised his elm-bow and fitted shaft to
string it was pointblank arrow range
and too far for a spear to carry yet sig-
mund hesitating not hurled his spear even
as the bowstring twanged the shaft flew
past his ear in answer to its hum came the
clangor of his weapon tearing through the
archers mail in his extremity sigmund
had made such a cast as men might tell of
for generations to come

  he hurled himself upon the officer who
stood manfully to meet him shouting for
help the while their blades met with a
grinding clash but sigmunds strength tore
the weapon from the others hand a
second stroke sheared the goths mail rent
the shoulder asunder and found his heart

   sweeping the forest for signs of fresh foes
sigmund found none but he found what
pleased him more through the long aisles
of trees a fresh trail was torn-a trail made
by many horses leading away from him
deep into the wood the pursuit had passed
these who had sighted him were stragglers
whose horses had foundered leaving them
to follow afoot

  swiftly he bore the bodies first the two
house-carls then the officer to his cave
and piling the captured weapons beside
them he went back to cover the traces of
the fight he smoothed out the deep scores
made by his and the officers feet in their
conflict covered the blood with earth and
leaves and went once more to his cave
here by its mouth where a little light
filtered in around the fall he examined his
spoil he had three suits of mail two
shields two undamaged helmets three
v engeance



swords a spear and a bow and quiver of
arrows

  the archer had been a big man his mail
though somewhat close in fit would serve
so would the cloak and breeches of good
stout stuff in the officers pouch he found
flint and steel and venturing out he
brought in dry moss and wood for a fire and
torches he was without food but when
his pursuers should have passed again he
would hunt he sighed at the thought of
food-he was ravenous as a beast the ex-
ertion of the fight had sent him into a deep
sweat with which his fever had vanished

  the days that followed with the sweet
woodland air with rest and food-the
forest abounded in game-brought back
abundant strength to sigmunds limbs
once sure of his endurance he struck out
with set matured purpose through the
depths of the wood to find the sea ven-
geance-the settled passion of his life-drove
him on it was in his heart to make the
coast whatever hazards lay between to
steal a boat and so reach his own land
once there he would proclaim to his people
the fate that had overcome his kinsmen
raise a host and return to lay gothland
waste from end to end

  the plan was ripe firm at all points his
ships would fall on siggeirs coast by night
and pour out their crews in a fierce stream
they would creep through the dark to sig-
geirs court set the garth on fire and drive
back into the flames all who fleeing from
the red death might run on their points
signy alone he would spare she should yet
find happiness with a better husband as
for siggeir-at thought of his name sig-
munds teeth ground and his brain went
hot-siggeir he would take alive and burn
him very slowly that his cowards soul
might fly shrieking to its doom

  on his broad back sigmund bore as much
food as he could carry he wore the mail
he had captured but to lighten his march
he took no weapon but a sword with
steady stride he marched all day and far
into the night he was up at dawn noon
brought him on a biting wind the salt tang
of the sea

  reaching a fishing village he laughed
aloud at sight of a score of tiny sails dancing
on the choppy water but as he strode
toward the landing-place a great ship of war
swept out from behind the grim headland
that bounded the tiny port red shields

gleamed on her bulwarks at her masthead
fluttered siggeirs pennon so close she
passed that to avoid discovery sigmund
was forced to dodge behind a salting-shed

  he almost fell over the knees of an old
fisherman who sat on a barnacled post
mending his net sigmund clutched the
gaping peasant by the arm

  what do the kings ships out at this
season he asked sharply it is over-
nigh winter for cruising

  the old man stared in bewilderment
you bear the kings mail he faltered
and do not know

  as thou seest sigmund retorted
speak when i bid thee

  they have come back good sir from
the conquest of frakkland

  frakkland sigmund echoed his heart
flooding with dismay frakkland-con-
quered-by siggeir

  the old man dropped his net and scram-
bled to his feet

  who art thou he gasped not to know
of this to what man in all gothland is it
unknown that our king set forth but
twelve days since to bring frakkland under
his rule and now his dragon-ships re-
turn victorious had he not destroyed
volsung and all his sons save one was it
not meet that he seize the occasion to finish
what he had begun

  sigmunds eyes burned on him so fiercely
that the fisherman broke off affrighted
the hate in the young mans face roused
him to comprehension he ducked under
sigmunds arm and ran to the shore scream-
ing in shrill terror

  help help ye goths sigmund is here-
the son of volsung

  cursing his clumsiness sigmund left the
fisherman still shrieking and waving his
lean arms at the long-ship she was almost
past the tiny bay but on her poop stood a
knot of spearmen pointing and shouting
sigmund without waiting for pursuit sped
inland to gain the shelter of the desolate
forest

  well for him that he did so for so close
was the kings ship to land that the old
mans cries had been clearly heard aboard
her as quickly as the helmsman could bring
her about she was brought in and made fast
to the rotting piles ere the fugitive had
reached the nearest trees a score of house-
carls were after him others waited only till
their horses could be brought ashore


adventure

  the bleak depths of the forest opened to
receive the hunted man and with the
strength of despair he laid the miles of
woodland behind at first he fled straight
and far to place as much sheer distance as
he might between himself and siggeirs
spears then when he deemed it safe he
turned aside dodging and twisting on a
weaving track till the early night fell he
felt no shame in flight for he had no fear
death meant nothing to him who had
defied fire and steel from childhood who
had seen his father fall at his side and his
brothers torn to shreds by the wolf-ay and
himself had been so close to its hot jaws
that the swift short agony of ax or spear
seemed but a grim jest he feared nothing
save that he might lose forever his precious
chance of revenge to avenge his dead he
must live to five he must keep out of sig-
geirs hands for this he was ready to flee
when he must though he longed for the joy
of meeting his foes face to face

  in the first hours of his flight he heard
over and over again the faint far cries of
his baffled enemies now as they caught
the print of his foot in the half-frozen mud
of a stream-bed they raised the viewhalloo
then having changed his course he left all
sound of them behind dusk fell he had
lost his bearings in his tortuous flight and
knew not how to reach his cave a hollow
tree gave him a hiding-place

 the tree an enormous oak was
 so rotted out with age that he
could stretch his long legs at ease
t within it his back against the
wood long he waited ears stretched for
the least sound of pursuit but only the
scurrying of little animals the prowling pads
of greater beasts or the scuffle and squeak
of hunted wild things disturbed him at
length he fell into a deep sleep

  just before dawn he awoke suddenly
hand on hilt a glint of trembling red shone
through the hollow oak rough voices rum-
bled in his ears

  they hunt a wolf but will stoop to a
weasel some one spoke from beyond the
crimson tongue of a camp-fire it is not
worth siggeirs trouble to hunt us so long
as we disturb him not but if his carls stum-
ble into us in their chase for volsungs son
then will they slay us to appease the thirst
of their spears

  why should we not hunt volsungs son

also the voice that asked was sharp and
shrill edged with evil if we can deliver
him up to siggeir our crimes will be for-
given mayhap we shall get gold to boot
a moments silence then the third spoke
wise words hund then there will be
an end of our hard life and we can five at
ease once more in the pleasant towns
siggeir will be glad to give us both gold and
pardon his house-carls are fools who can
not find their way in the forest but we
who know the wood as well as the very foxes
can easily track down a stranger like
sigmund

  sigmund sat mouse-still but the fingers
about his hilt were clenched hard

  look ye then said the first voice we
must lay our plans well and be secret
there may be many other lawless folk here-
abouts who like ourselves have sought
refuge in this wood from them we can
have help but that would mean dividing
the reward we must keep this secret be-
tween us and find sigmund ourselves

  he who was called hund laughed jeer-
ingly

  wisdom was born with thee thorir and
will die with thee he mocked has none
told thee that volsungs sons were all
big men wondrous strong and sigmund
the mightiest of them all it will be hard
for any three men to master him there-
fore i hold it best to get the help of our fel-
low outlaws

  the others broke in on him with curses
nay misbegotten one we will have
all the gold for ourselves if thou fearest
leave it to to us who are brave

  not so shrilled hund i will strike
as deep as any of ye and i will have my
share but if we must do it alone then
must we find where he hides and creep up
on him while he sleeps and bind him
his counsel was shrewd and the others
praised him

  are we agreed then asked the first
when light comes we will separate and
each hunt sigmund by himself each
night till we find his lair we shall meet here
to give account of the search when we
know where he is we shall stalk our quarry
in his slumber all three together

  sigmund heard them with a grim smile
he moved very softly so that he could peer
out through the hollow

  between the great trunks of the oaks
they sat those three outlawed men big of
vengeance



limb all and heavy-bearded their gar-
ments hung in grimy tatters over rusty mail
their swords were out at scabbard the
flickering firelight played over their vile fea-
tures betraying them for the rogues they
were-peaceless men who warred on the
defenseless and struck in the dark they
were the first human souls sigmund had
seen in the forest and their hands like all
mens were against him the baseness of
their plot and the thought that here in his
last desperate refuge such things as these
hunted him threatened his vengeance
filled him with fury he stood alone on
earth the homes and ways of men closed to
him the very scum of mankind baying at
his heels his lip lifted in a snarl in that
moment he who before had but defended
himself became a pitiless killer

  inch by inch he edged on hands and
knees from the hollow tree his sword
clenched in his fingers he was halfway
out when hund having thrown more wood
on the fire looked up and in the rising flame
saw a fierce face bristling with stubble
glaring at him with hot eyes with a cry
of fear the outlaw scrambled to his feet

  his comrades leaped up snatching at
their weapons but on the instant of their
rising sigmund was among them one
turning at bay with darting point was
hurled to earth his skull split at the first
stroke thorir fell as he turned to flee
hund shrieking heard the pad of ruthless
feet behind him for a hundred yards ere
death ended his terror

  sigmund scowled into the gray light of
dawn

  so there are more of them in the forest
he muttered ay so they said good i
will hunt them ere they hunt me by all
the gods of asgard i will make my name so
terrible to them that they will fling them-
selves into flood or fire rather than face me

  he kept his word

  but he heard nothing of signy though
days and years dragged by

chapter v

the first stroke

tittle need i fear thy brother now
 signy turned her calm gaze on her
husband standing with widespread legs be-
tween her and the hall fire but she said
nothing what should she say

  not one word had she had from sigmund
nor had such few timid messengers as she
could trust brought back any news of him
the forest was great trackless swarming
with wild beasts and reputed the abode of
demons not many dared brave its perils
she knew not even whether sigmund yet
lived this alone she knew if he lived he
would neither give up his cherished ven-
geance nor fail to take the first means that
offered to get word to her

  he has been eaten by wolves siggeir
taunted her or slain by outlaws i was
overprudent to take such precautions
against him his valor and strength were
less than men thought else he had lived and
sought me out with the sword

  signy went on with her sewing

  how should one man however brave
she asked get at a foe who never shows his
face outside his walls unless a hundred
house-carls attend him if thou hast any
wish to meet sigmund go alone into the
forest but as thou sayest he is doubtless
dead a kind husband thou hast been to
me to bring about the death of all my kin

  though her words were bitter her tone
was unmoved she bit off her thread and
laying her work aside arose

  since thou no longer hast cause to fear
my brother wilt thou give me leave to
build me a bower where my fathers sons
were slain by the wolf it is now ten years
since sigmund escaped and in all that time
nothing has been heard of him i would
fain have a place to mourn my brethren nor
is there anywhere a fitter place than where
they died

  siggeir regarded her a moment his eyes
filmed with suspicion she had been a
docile wife and had borne him two strong
sons but she was of the volsung blood un-
likely to forget an injury yet if sigmund
still lived he would surely have struck be-
fore this even though he cherished scant
hope of success for the volsungs were
proud and reckless prone to give their
passions full course though they died for it
all in all siggeir saw no reason why the
building of that bower by the stocks at the
forest edge could work him harm he was
more afraid of his wifes quiet unrevealed
resentment than of the flaming spirit of her
brother dead or no a woman who en-
dured all things so quietly neither breaking
nor retaliating was as strong and deep as
the sea it would be as well to yield to her


adventure

in small things it might help her to forget
how cruelly he had injured her

 thou shalt have thy bower he an-
swered his lips framing a twisted smile
give orders how thou wilt have it built
and i will see it done

  she thanked him quietly and passed out
into the kitchens

  siggeir stood staring after her a stately
woman this unbent by suffering there was
no thread of gray in her spun-gold hair nor
a wrinkle marring her face how could
she bear up thus under the load of grief he
had put upon her well he knew she had
not forgotten well he knew she did not love
him but he never perceived the full deep
tide of her hate that so filled her as to
leave no room for other emotions her
hate for siggeir-unlike sigmunds-was
not one that burned the soul and seared the
features not one that set the weary body
twisting and the nerves throbbing in the
very depth of sleep

  she was content to live on doing her
daily task waiting patiently for the time
ordained of the gods the revenge for
which she lived was to her mind as sure of
fulfilment as the coming of spring after
winter-she looked forward to it as a maid
bethrothed looks forward to marriage it
was the fixed and certain culmination of
her desires for this reason hatred though
coursing through her veins with her blood
did not age her nor did grief-lulled by the
constant thought of the revenge to come-
mark her loveliness with the lines of sorrow
woman though she was she was the strong-
est soul of all the house of volsung

  for once siggeir kept his word to her
that same day he sent laborers with adze
and saw and hammer to build the bower
where the stocks had been oxen hauled
seasoned timber from his yards to the spot
and the work went forward briskly in
three days the bower was finished the pun-
gent smell of balsam hung about the wood
rich webs of tapestry clothed the walls
vessels of gold and silver adorned table and
chests the floor was strewn with fresh
rushes and in the hearth glowed a hot fire

  the king himself brought his wife to see
the abode he had built for her with a
strange feeling half pity half desire to taunt
her he had seen himself to the adornment of
the walls and the service of precious metal
everything there from the simplest brooch
to the richly molded flagons was spoil his

crews had ravished from conquered frakk-
land-from the very hall of her father

  seeing these she understood and for the
first time since sigmunds flight her hate
touched the springs of passion yet with
cunning strength she dissembled after a
single stolen glance at her husbands girdle
where hung the sword that sigmund had
wrenched from the branstock when sig-
geir left her alone with her devoted maid-
servant she began to weep thinking of the
happy days of girlhood of her brothers and
all the many scenes which these precious
things about her called to memory

  her tears fell fast at first silently then
with sobs that racked her breast it was
long ere weary to exhaustion she fell asleep
when she woke the torches were out and
she knew it for the dead of night the fire
had died down to a heap of red coals the
windless night was bleakly chill shivering
signy roused her maid

  is it midnight yet valrun she asked

  the maid nodded then remembering the
dark she answered aloud

  ay for the kings guard has been
changed i heard their calls from the
garth

  make up the fire and light a torch

  the maid fetched fresh wood from the
outhouse and heaped it on the coals when
the flames filled the room with their gleam
valrun saw that the queen had drawn the
thick hangings across those windows which
gave on the clearing and the royal court
beyond

  what need of a torch asked valrun
is the firelight not enough

  not for my need nay do not close the
hangings there i would breathe the odors
of the forest what guards have been set
here

  few the maid answered this being so
near the garth ulfgeir and two house-
carls watch on the forest edge

  signy smiled strangely

  go out and bid ulfgeir come to me
she ordered

  the maid put on her cloak and departed

  ulfgeir signy smiled at the strange fatu-
ity that made her husband in most things
so shrewd a plotter so blind where she was
concerned he had set ulfgeir to watch
her as he had given her valrun for a maid
the two were brother and sister valrun
had loved one of the kings officers and
signy secretly gave the girl a dowry out of
vengeance



her own brideprice when valruns hus-
band fell in battle with the danes and the
young wife overwhelmed with grief gave
birth to a dead child signys tenderness to
her won ulfgeirs devotion

  not three months since he owed her a
greater debt six of siggeirs long-ships
had sunk in a sudden storm and the king
superstitious ever laid his misfortune to
spells cast by ulfgeirs ancient mother
gunnhild who bore the name of a witch
by signys connivance the old woman had
made her escape from court and now lay
hidden in a distant village thus the
brother and sister set by siggeir to spy on
his wife had become devoted to her ulf-
geir was a brave man and honorable he
would do nothing to betray his master but
it would not occur to him to question too
closely anything signy might ask

  ulfgeir entered behind valrun closing the
door at once to shut out the keen winter air
signy went to meet him and laid a hand on
his arm

  it is cold for you out there she said her
face kindly anxious

  we have a fire he answered touched
by her concern

  ye need more on such a night bring
your men within my bower to comfort
themselves with warmth and wine for an
hour ye can protect me here as well as a
spear-cast away and if the kings command
keep you on post ye can go back after ye
are well-warmed

  ulfgeir was a good soldier whose valor
had earned his rank but he was slow of wit

  it is well said he bowed for myself
i care little but my men are cold we will
bide with you a little while and go back
again

  he brought in his two house-carls rough
shag-bearded champions a little awed at
their queens graciousness but the wine
eased their minds and lightened their
tongues within the hour they were warm
filled with good drink and overflowing with
gratitude ulfgeir himself was very merry
he could not hold much drink his speech
thickened and he was almost maudlin with
the sense of signys kindness to poor
soldiers

  watching signy urged fresh drink on
him and when he had lost all caution she
heaped the measure of his devotion full by
the gift of a jeweled mantle-clasp he rose
to go bowing awkwardly over her hand

  we must to post he stammered
would i could repay your kindness lady
thou canst she told him in a voice low
with confidence the king has built me
this bower that i might mourn here for my
brothers slain by the wolf on this very spot
thou rememberest my grief for them gives
me no rest i would fain speak with their
ghosts if they will come to me it is the
only way to ease my bursting heart
ulfgeir nodded he would fain have said
something to comfort this gentle lady whom
he pitied with all his heart but his wine-
soaked tongue refused its service it was
some moments before his sodden mind
grasped the full import of what she had said
when it did his teeth began to chatter

  the ghosts of the volsungs he qua-
vered they will come here nay odin
forbid we are siggeirs men their foes-
they will tear us to pieces

  signy smiled

  it is well known that the ghosts of the
slain come back to destroy their enemies
she said and smiled again to see the valiant
knees of ulfgeir knock together but they
will not harm you who have ever been kind
to me yet since they will come from the
forest whither their flesh was borne in the
body of the wolf it were better that ye
leave your post between this bower and the
trees and bide on the other side of the bower
with it between you and the wood then
if the ghosts of my brothers visit me they
will not see you

  ulfgeir assented eagerly and with all the
speed his legs could compass he drove his
men to fetch brands from their camp-fire
to a safer post on the court side of the bower
when they were gone signy turned to her
maid

  kindle a new torch she bade and the
woman touched a length of fat pine to the
fire

  signy reached out a hand to take it but
valrun turned to her with anxious eyes

  what do you with my brother mis-
tress she questioned having made
him drunk you send him from his post
what if the king learn of this

  trust me signy answered i will
save him from all blame if thou and he but
hold your tongues

  signy advanced to the uncurtained win-
dow that gave on the wood and swung the
torch to and fro till her arm was weary

  it was her hope that sigmund if he still


adventure t

lived would see her signal as she had
tried everything open to her to get word to
him so she still hoped even against reason
that he might still watch for some message
from her only death could make him for-
get either his revenge or his love for her if
he lived he must surely still think of her and
wait for a sign from her it was with this
in her thoughts that she had asked siggeir
for the bower

  but though she stood by the window all
night lighting torch after torch resting
only to bid her maid take her place no
answer came from the forest with dawn
she gave over and flung herself exhausted
on her bed

  with dawn also ulfgeir and his men
went back to their first post very glad to
have seen no volsung ghosts here siggeir
found them when he entered the bower
signy slept so soundly that he would not
waken her she roused at last to find him
standing over her

   he smiled at her heavy eyes

   it is plain to see that you mourned last
night he said

  his voice was gentle but there was a
mocking glint in his eye he wished to
placate her and yet found it hard to cease
his habitual taunting

   and so i shall for many nights to come
she answered till the load of grief has left
-my heart

  may that time come soon he said i
like not dull faces about me-
the next night also and the next signy
spent like the first and her heart sank in
her breast surely sigmund must come-
unless he were dead that she would not
believe ulfgeir and his men came each
night as before for their drink and a seat by
the warm fire when they had done they
stood guard on that side of the bower fur-
thest from the forest though no ghosts
came they still feared

   on the fourth night ulfgeir grew bolder
as he sat drinking in the bower a thought
took shape in his mind though he said
nothing of it it grew to a firm resolve at
the wonted time he withdrew with his men
and after an hour at the fire he stirred

  bide ye here lads he commanded i
go to look for ghosts

  this was not the truth for there was
nothing he wished less to see than the ghost
of volsung or even the least of volsungs
sons but he was pot-valiant tonight hav-

ing drunk more than was his wont he had
never feared mortal man and having never
seen a ghost he thought it unlikely he
should see one now if the ghosts of signys
kin could walk why had they not shown
themselves ere this three whole nights
she had waited for them it would be a
brave thing to boast of to his followers if he
could tell them he had defied the spirits and
walked to the very edge of the forest sober
he would not have dared drunk he deemed
the risk slight and the glory great he
walked unsteadily around the house

  at the very moment of his rising signy
drew back from her window chalk-white
and opened the bower door with trembling
fingers ulfgeir turned the corner of the
building just in time to see her run toward
the wood he followed after wondering
stupidly and half-afraid then suddenly
he stopped still the hair rising on his neck
a cold wind seemed to ripple up his spine
with a howl of terror he turned and ran to
his comrades smitten with his fright they
fled for the garth

  what he had seen was a tall shape in
armour outlined against the trees by the
stream of light from the one uncurtained
window the figure was huge far great-
er than man-or so it seemed to his
wine-glazed panic-dazzled eyes-majestic
mighty-limbed bearded from eyes to waist
the shape stood motionless as a god might
stand-or a ghost and his mind being
filled with ghosts ulfgeir was certain that
the vision boded ill

  signy her heart beating high with joy
ran toward the shape with outstretched
arms it moved strode toward her and
clasped her to its mailed breast

  sigmund-my brother she whispered
and the son of volsung held her close strok-
ing her golden hair

  night after night have i watched for
you she panted her voice muffled against
his deep chest

  night after night have i come hither
he answered to this very spot waiting for
you all these ten years have i waited
missing only those first weeks when i feared
pursuit and times since when i could not
come think you i could forget

  but the last three nights-

  i have been in hiding from foes outlaws
whom i hunted till they banded together
and turned the hunt against me they cut
me off from this side of the forest last
vengeance



night thinking me far away they slept i
crept upon them and slew them how
fares it with you

   she wasted no words coming straight to
 what was in her heart

   i bide the time for our vengeance and
 you

   sigmund kissed her

  there spoke volsungs daughter i
too bide my time i am alone like a wolf
driven from the pack without help i
cannot strike against siggeir surrounded as
he is by many house-carls had i but one
stout comrade of volsungs blood i would
find a way but there is none-i am the
last man of our line and none but a child of
volsung would dare the perils of the ven-
geance i have planned

   you would dare-with but one to help
she questioned one of volsungs blood
ay there is a way listen he
bent to whisper in her ear

   she smiled up at him then i can help
you i have two sons by siggeir-and
volsung was grandsire to them both
thou wouldst give me a child of thine
to help me slay its own father

  my brother thou canst not know my
joy if a son of mine should deal the murderer
of our folk his death blow

  sigmund held her off from him and
looked long into her eyes

   thou art indeed a child of heroes he
 cried i will take thy gift-may it prove
 a good one thy sons have volsungs blood
 but they have siggeirs also if they are
 men like our father they will serve but if
 they be cowards like him who begat them we
 must find other means what is their age
 the elder is nine years the younger
 eight thou art content to wait for ven-
 geance till they are of age to help thee
 sigmund smiled bitterly

  look upon me sister thou hast
changed little with the years but i am an-
other man hardship and loneliness have
dealt harshly with me but so do i feel
toward thy husband that i could wait till
age bent me double and turned my strength
to weakness if waiting could make my
vengeance surer and the more cruel

  what are the passing years nothing
in all this earth is sweet to me save the
thought of siggeir under my spear and the
fear of me in his eyes send me thy eldest
son i will make him a man and when he is
ripe i will use him for our revenge

  signy nodded do thou come hither
tomorrow night she said i will have
him for thee teach him to hate as i
hate

  have no fear-if he be a man

  he kissed her and vanished among the
trees

ulfgeir saw him go for ulf-
geir was no coward and taking
his fear in his hands he had
crept back alone to the very
bower-door brother and sister spoke so
softly that he could hear no word but he
saw them kiss and felt the ice of terror in
his very marrow for the great mailed
form in signys embrace had the carriage
and face of volsung whom ulfgeir had
seen slain years before

  he never dreamed it was sigmund-
sigmund he had last known as a young
man beardless and handsome and this
vision was like a man of forty with cheeks
deep-furrowed scarred with wounds and
seamed with care

  signy found the goth leaning against her
door-post sick from fear

  what dost thou here she chided him

  the ghost-the ghost of volsung he
babbled

  it has not harmed thee nor will it
she smiled understanding his delusion and
bending it to her purpose

  he will come again tomorrow night but
if nothing is said of his visits he will spare
thee and thy men if any of ye speak of
it-

  ulfgeir raised his trembling hands and
swore eternal silence

  then go she ordered find the
house-carls and bid them hold their tongues
if they would live

  ulfgeir who alone knew what had
frightened him went straight to seek his
men he found them cowering in the hall
surrounded by the night guard prating of
they knew not what they had seen no
ghost it was their officers panic which had
sent them scurrying

  his pallor loosed a flood of questions
from his fellow-officers

  a troll appeared to me riding a wolf
with a serpent for bridle he lied

  then by the gods we go not back
swore his shivering house-carls

  nay fear not he reassured them-
himself still in woeful fear-she rides to


adventure

norway where there is war she promised
to give us no trouble henceforth

  but it took three measures of stinging ale
to give his men the courage to resume their
watch over the bower

a signy did not trouble to signal
her brother on the following
night he had promised to come
andknew the way so she lay
quiet in her bed in the darkened bower her
maid asleep at her feet and her elder boy
by her side no light no fire burned to be-
tray the midnight visitor ulfgeir and his
house-carls having drunk themselves full to
keep up courage dozed over their camp-fire

  signy lay with eyes closed-that she
might not see her brother wise with the
wisdom of adversity needed no active help
from her she heard nothing save the
heavy breathing of the maid saw nothing
but a little after midnight she felt the boy
drawn gently from her arms and a puff of
cold air from the door she stretchedout
her arms and felt the warm empty place
where her son had lain and she smiled

  odin grant him worthy of his grand-
sires blood she whispered and fell into a
sound sleep

  when she awoke the dawn light was gray
in the bower glancing at the sleeping
maid she sat upright flung her hair into
wild disorder and shrieked valrun leaped
from her couch staring wildly from sleep-
weighted eyes-one glance at the queen
wailing over the childs empty pillow and
the girl ran out crying for help

  ulfgeir and his guards heavy with ale
clanked over the threshold

  my son my son sobbed signy my
eldest born the heir of my lord he is
gone

  the soldiers cast furtive looks at each
other and at their officer how shall it
go with us one muttered when the king
hears of this

  this thought had been uppermost in
ulfgeirs mind but he was a good man and
felt shame that his own danger troubled
him more than the queens grief

  into the forest he cried this is the
work of some beast-wolf or bear search
for tracks

  he ran into the wood the house-carls at
his heels not one of the three but shiv-
ered to think that that which had stolen the
boy might be a ghost rather than a beast of

prey had not ulfgeir seen a troll had
they not feared siggeir so much they would
not have been so swift to venture the perils
of the haunted forest

  when they were gone signy turned to
her maid

  thou lovest me she asked

  hast thou not always shown me kind-
ness the girl replied as my life i love
thee

  thou wilt not betray me then neither
for gold nor from fear

  valrun looked long and steadily into
signys eyes if thou hadst not trusted
me she said thou wouldst have sent me
away before thou didst summon the ghost
from the forest and now i am sure it was
the ghost that took the boy i see it was
thy will the child should go i know not
what this means but i am content if thou
art neither bribes shall buy thy secret
from me nor torture force it from my lips-
provided no harm comes to my brother
trust me for that signy agreed now
go to the hall and say to the king that
wolves have taken his son

        ulfgeir and his men returned
late at night stumbling with fa-
sgrakjr tigue faint from hunger and slow
with their fear after them strag-
gled others whom siggeir had sent by scores
to search for his child no trace nor track
had they found either of man or of beast
for the ground was iron-hard with frost
they came trembling into siggeirs presence

  the king sat in his high seat his face
twisted with grief and fury when ulf-
geirs men approached he rose up and
stormed at them

  curs are ye that make yourselves fat on
my bounty and neither bark nor bite my
foes ye shall hang all three

  but signy cast herself at his feet her
eyes swollen with tears her arms clasping
his knees

  slay them not my lord she begged
faithfully have they watched but in the
dark the gray wolf may go so soft that
neither eyes can see nor ears hear him
they have served you well before and will
serve the better if you pardon them
have you no love for your child
siggeir raged at her she burst into a
fresh passion of grief and he could not
doubt her sorrow but doubts of one thing
he had-doubts that fed his wrath
vengeance



  can a wolf open a door he cried
this is the deed of men not of beasts
had it been men we should both have
seen and heard ulfgeir ventured

  ye lie the king shouted shaking his
clenched hands at them it was men and
ye slept or dared not face them

  ulfgeir-who had not slept and held it
impossible for any man to slip past his vigi-
lance-drew himself up in injured pride
the recollection that he had been heavy
with drink gnawed at his conscience but
this made him protest the more vehemently

  we were not asleep he retorted nor
had we been afraid would fear have kept us
from sending one man to rouse your guard
it was either a wolf or-a ghost

  siggeir started as if a blade had pierced
his heart old memories that had well nigh
faded fears he had deemed dead surged
over his guilty heart

  a ghost he echoed ay a ghost in-
deed it was volsungs ghost that hath done
this deed-or-perchance sigmund lives
he stood stiff and still his brain slow to
cope with this new terror but in a little
while the color flowed back into his cheeks
and breath came freer his eyes fastened
on his wife still lying at his feet

  there has been no proof of sigmunds
death he spoke slowly the throbbing of
his heart breaking his speech if he lives
-after all these years-if his hand be in
this then there are those who have helped
him

  stooping he caught his wifes arm in iron
fingers

  speak thou he ordered fiercely re-
member thou art more than sigmunds
sister-thou art my wife hast thou con-
spired with him to rob me of my son
signy met his gaze steadily no sign of
guilt in her grief-stricken face she seemed
suddenly old her eyes showed only truth
and sorrow

  would i give up my own child to one who
hates his father and if so thinkest thou
that if sigmund lived thou wouldst still
live too could a living man steal past the
guards or take my child from my arms
without waking me say thou rather if
it was not the ghost of my father or of one
of my brethren whom thou didst slay
treacherously

  siggeirs glare wavered his rage was
mastered by wo and fear surely a mother
would not willingly lose her child and signy

was a most tender mother he had seen
her with their sons and knew she loved
them more than she had ever loved him

  it was truly much more likely that a ghost
had stolen the boy than that ulfgeir most
faithful of officers should let a living foe
slip by him all men knew that ghosts stole
children all men knew that the ghosts of
the foully slain come back to avenge them-
selves on their murderer would there be
more vengeance yet the kings limbs
trembled he sank into his seat and covered
his face with his hands

  my son my son he mourned why
will the dead not let me be

chapter vi

the second stroke

f he bower by the forest stood empty

     siggeir had decreed that none should
go nigh the haunted spot signy bided at
home perforce her face masked in sadness
her heart on fire with hope

  she knew she was watched her husband
convinced though he was that the ghosts of
his foes and not their living arms had
stolen his son yet doubted his wife she
was volsungs daughter might not her dead
kin work their will through her

  he kept her ever by him and at night she
could not stir from his side he was de-
termined none should speak with her man
or ghost without his knowledge yet
signy was not discouraged there would be
some way to get word to her brother sig-
mund was shrewd and she herself no fool
she spoke not save when the king addressed
her but her eyes roved to valruns when-
ever the maid came to her and valrun
understood

  none thought to restrain valrun she was
a goth born sister to one of siggeirs bravest
officers thus it chanced that valrun-her
pulses hammering with fear of the unknown
-slipped out one night to the forest ten
days after the child had been taken for
most of that interval siggeirs house-carls
had quartered the forest searching for any
sign of sigmund living or dead for the
king who had never taken chances in his
life meant to take none now men they
found-outlaws wretched things in rags and
shreds of mail half-starved folk who knew
nothing and could but whine at their own
hardships
adventure

  these wherever caught told always the
same tale they were poor folk who had
fled to the wood to escape justice but had
done no great wrong nay they had seen
no man in the forest save other poor folk like
themselves but there was one that hunted
them and it they feared above all things
for it leaped upon them like the thunder-
bolt slaying and sparing none

  sigmund the kings men whispered to
one another but the outlaws shook fright-
ened heads

  it is no man but a fiend-one of the
offspring of loki the evil god they stam-
mered we know if it were a man we
could have slain him but though ten of us
go against it at once it slays and takes no
hurt no man could do this

  no man indeed the soldiers muttered
and they reported to siggeir that a devil
haunted the wood

  to siggeir that devil assumed the face
and shape of sigmund but he was certain
now that it was sigmunds ghost the
searching ceased it does no good to hunt
the dead nor would his house-carls any
longer enter the forest thus sigmund owed
his safety to those three rascals who long
since dead had plotted to betray him to
siggeir and who had succeeded only in
making him a terror to all their kind

  the search thus ended valrun found none
between her and the royal garth to bar her
way well she knew what her mistress
wanted in her own heart she thought the
vision of that first night in the bower a
ghost but recalling its seamed and worn
visage she held it for the ghost of the
queens father signy wanted her to find
the ghost and talk to it she would sooner
have faced pestilence or torture but loving
her mistress as a dog loves its master she
went

  once swallowed up by the forest she fell
a prey to her fears all the more when the
dense blackness laid its spell on her her
feet made eerie rustling noises in the dead
leaves the forest chill struck to her heart
ever and again she blundered into a tree or
caught her hair in its branches twigs snap-
ped back in her face bringing tears to her
eyes she was in a very panic of terror
when something fell hard on her shoulder
she shrieked and a heavy hand clapped
across her mouth

  but the touch of that hand the warm
reality of it brought her courage flooding

back this was not the wan chill touch of
a ghost it was alive like herself the hand
passed swiftly over her face her shoulders
her hair

  thou art too short for signy a voice
rumbled her servant then

  her maid valrun the girl answered
boldly she wished me to come being
close watched herself

  what is her will

  it was weird to hear that heavy voice so
close yet out of a darkness so black that
not a line tf face or figure could be seen

  that i know not having had no chance
to speak with her i know only what her
looks told me that i must come and speak
with thee how didst thou find me in this
dark

  thy feet made noise enough to betray
thee the unseen answered i have
watched at the forest edge since the house-
qirls gave up the hunt for me it was easy
to follow thee here where none could spy
upon us so i am to speak with thee not
knowing what my sister wishes

thy sister thou art sigmund then
after a moments silence the man replied
since thou art faithful to my sister i
may tell thee ay i am sigmund tell
the queen that her son is a coward of no
use to me or himself

  he fears the beasts of the forest fears
steel fears the look of my eyes i have tied
him up in my lair he whines at the pain of
the cords though they are loose ask
signy what i shall do with him come to-
morrow night with her answer now i will
lead thee back lest thou lose thyself

all the next day valrun waited
her time to speak with signy and
it came at last siggeir was in-
specting his ships of war seeing
to their condition ere they should be shedded
for the winter he had left his queen in the
hands of radgeir-once chief of the coast-
guard now first spear of his house-carls
this was a stern man devoted to his lord
distrustful of all others signy would have
no commerce with her kin ghosts or men
so long as radgeir lived

  but radgeir had no orders to keep val-
run from her mistress the two were sew-
ing together the girl at signys feet and
ever and anon valrun would show the queen
her work as if asking approval signy
would nod and bend again over her task
vengeance



for some hours radgeir watched them
closely for a little longer he watched list-
lessly then he ceased to heed them at all
save to see that none came nigh them with-
out his knowledge when he was turned
away from them signy-who had marked
the eager light in her servants eyes-bent
over valrun holding her sewing as if to
show the girl how the work should be done

  thou hast news she whispered and
valrun poured out sigmunds message as
fast as her mistress could grasp the soft-
uttered words

  when she understood her face darkened
with pain but her eyes were hard

  my son a coward she murmured ah
the gods have spared me nothing

  a little while she sat so her hand clutch-
ing her heart her eyes wet and burning
then she bent down again and whispered-
say to my brother that i will send my
other son as soon as may be mayhap he
will prove his mothers child as for the
first-bid my brother look to it that the
blood of volsung shall not be reproached
with flowing in a cowards veins

  the girl shuddered but that night she
crept out again and did as she was told
sigmund slew the child in its sleep

having given up his elder
son for lost siggeir kept strictest
watch over the one that was left
him he would scarce let the
boy out of his sight day or night he took
him with him on the hunt on his royal
progress from town to town out to the
farms where the king surveyed the winter
care of his herds and his horses at night
the child slept in a little bed beside the
royal couch a guard was set without the
chamber and a strong force posted at each
door even signy was scarce allowed to
see her son alone

  but signy was patient ten years had
she waited for her revenge shewould wait
ten more or twenty if need were the
death of her first child had caused her little
pain he was siggeirs son she thought
more than hers she had borne him but
there was none of her spirit in him since
he was a coward like his father it was
right that he should die

  but she hoped better things of the other
it would be sweet to know that he had his
grandsire volsungs fierce brave heart
that one day he would avenge his kin

she never saw him without searching his
innocent eyes for some sign of the high vol-
sung pride she scanned his tender limbs for
traces of the mighty volsung frame that
one day might be his those little fingers
would some day swing a sword those baby
eyes kindle with the hot lust of fight

  sigmund was weary of watching and
waiting learning from valrun how close
a watch was kept over his sisters second
son he spent his days contriving a way to
get at him signy could not help valrun
had not the cunning to be more than a tool
and he could think of no way to use her
but that much signy did for him

  thy mother is a witch she said one
day to valrun none overhearing them

  so men say the girl answered

  she is a good one

  she can foretell the future and brew
potions men say she makes spells that
can turn men into beasts but that is
false

  the king would kill her if he could find
her signy went on why does she not
turn her witchcraft against him

  for my brothers sake and mine
valrun explained ulfgeir has forbidden
her to harm the king otherwise she would
do so for she hates him

  thou knowest her hiding-place

  valrun nodded

  go to her then tonight and tell her
what i bid thee signy whispered in the
girls ear and valrun at first frightened
smiled after a little

  sigmund waited long for valrun that
night and when at last she came gunnhild
the witch was with her he could not see
them for the dark but his forest-trained ear
warned him that two approached the meet-
ing-place waiting till they were close he
drew his sword and bade them stand
valruns voice reassured him

  i bring thee another who hates siggeir
she said and told him that signy had bidden
her bring him the hunted witch

  it was two nights before the yule feast
when as men believe witches and all evil
powers have greater might than at other
times having passed ten years in a forest
reputed the haunt of wicked spirits sig-
mund was less afraid of the old woman than
another would have been but he was not
comfortable in her presence

  why dost thou hate siggeir he ques-
tioned her


adventure

  seek not to know what does not concern
thee sigmund she made answer

  he was astonished at her voice it was
clear like the sound of a flute with no trace
of age marring it and she spoke with the
force of one who expects to be listened
to he took her up sharply for he was no
man to be cowed by an old woman witch
or no

  how does my name concern thee he
asked

  mayhap i seek an ally against my
enemy mayhap thou canst use my help
what better ally can i have than one who
seeks blood-vengeance on him who has
harmed me what better help canst thou
have than mine when none other is offered
thee

  sigmund did not ask what pledge of good
faith she could offer her presence there with
valrun and the message from signy were
surety enough

  how canst thou help me he demanded
wilt thou cast a spell on siggeir that he
may go mad and rush into the forest where
i may seize him

  the witch laughed and the sound of it
was music its youthfulness in one old
enough to be ulfgeirs mother was grislier
than any display of fallen chops beaked
nose or hooked chin

  nay for i have sworn to work no
magic on him but i can give thee a sleep-
ing potion and leave the rest to thee

  valrun stood silent her arm in her weird
mothers and to her it was a grim and awful
thing to hear those two voices from the
dark each edged with hate each seeming
more than human in the power and daring
of the speaker they spoke and answered
unseen like disembodied spirits when the
girl spoke it was to calm her own terrors
more than to offer help

  why should not i administer the po-
tion she asked being of the court i
can go about in it unquestioned whereas
sigmund risks death

  because thou art my daughter bound
by my oath the old woman retorted if
thou wert caught it would go hard with
ulfgeir this is sigmunds affair let him
manage it

  while the old woman spoke sigmunds
plan had been forming his heart glowed
with renewed hope

  where do they keep their drink he
questioned

  the ale-casks lie in a shed beyond the
kitchens valrun answered far enough
from the fire to freeze

sigmund understood for he
knew the custom the yule
feast was the great winter festi-
val to the gods since it was not
fit that men should drink ordinary liquor on
such a high occasion the strongest ale was
chosen and set where all would freeze save
an inner core which would take on triple
strength through the absorption of the
water in the frozen rim of this thrice-
strengthened core the warriors would drink
their yule toasts and few would go to bed
on their own feet

  he laughed scornfully thinking how he
would play with siggeirs yule drink

  on which side of the garth is the ale-
house he asked and how near the pali-
sade

  within ten paces on the south

then bid my sister drink sparingly
the witch gunnhild echoed his laugh and
touched his shoulder with her cold fingers

  it is given me to see somewhat into
hidden things she said i tell thee now
sigmund that in this which thou art about
to undertake thou shalt succeed and yet
thou shalt fail nor will thy vengeance be
fulfilled till thou hast the help of one in
whom volsungs blood is untainted by
siggeirs

  what mean these riddles he asked
angrily and what is thy concern in my
vengeance

  the witch answered slowly with a touch
of bitterness

  my hate of siggeir is like thine-it
must be slaked whatever the cause thou
strikest for us both and it is revealed to me
that in thy success there shall be black
misery for us both yet thou must go on to
thy destiny and i must help thee thou
hadst a sword once which siggeir now has
with it thou shalt win vengeance

  no spirit revealed that to thee
sigmund retorted all the north knows
of that sword

  more shall be known of it ere the tale be
done she answered

  he snatched at her arm resolved to
know more but she darted from him and
valrun with her though he followed
swiftly keeping on their track by the sound
of the leaves that crackled under their feet
                           vengeance

they reached the open before him he
dared not approach closer to the court

  the witchs voice drifted back to him as
he halted

  tell the queen my daughter what i
have said to her brother

kol the butlers knave slept
lightly being troubled with thirst
at night it was his task not
only to watch the casks to broach
them when fresh ale was wanted and to
help serve but also to sample the drink
every day so that only the strongest and
best might be set aside for the yule feast

  the constant taste of the liquor made
him crave more he was the driest thrall in
all gothland thrice each night he rose
from his warm couch by the coals of the
kitchen fire and ventured into the freezing
night without a hght to pay unwarranted
visits to the casks

  the night before yule being so afflicted
at the accustomed hour he rose and thrust
his nose into a driving snow storm-the first
of the winter which had been unwontedly
dry and cold with his accustomed stealth
he crossed the garth and crept toward the
shed as he pushed the door open-ever so
softly lest the hinges creak-he was aware
of a light in the windowless building and
peering in he saw a huge man muffled in a
bearskin bending over the casks the
mans face was half hidden by the bears
head which had been made so cunningly
into a cowl that the teeth leered above the
wearers brow and the hair of the neck
swathed his cheeks and throat the visitor
held a flaming pine-splinter in his hand and
had broached a cask kol had made marks
on those set aside for the feast and saw that
the man had chosen one of the marked kegs

  only kols face projected into the shed
and this he withdrew quickly filling his
lungs for a cry of alarm but ere he could
scream the bear-man shot out one great
arm his iron fingers wrapped themselves
about kols throat kol had no time to
struggle the hand closed and kols throat
became straightway useless for ale-tasting

  lowering the corpse to the rough board
floor the visitor closed the door again and
went on with his task each marked cask
he broached into each he dropped some
unseen thing and plugged the cask again
at last extinguishing the torch he dragged
the lifeless kol outside and scanned the

palisade it was unguarded on such cold
nights the guards slept indoors with sen-
tries posted only at the doors of hall and

bower and in the loft

  the intruder propped kol against the
palisade reached up and drew himself to
the top then hooking his ankles about the
posts he hung head down and dragged kol
over

  the next day at dawn kol was sent for
but none found him

at the second cock-crow on
the night of the feast sigmund
scaled the stockade again this
time he strode straight to the
main door of the hall his sword was loose
in its sheath but he looked for no resistance
he knew valrun would have told his sister
of his plan and signy would see to it that
all in the court drank deep that yule the
sleeping potion would clear a way for him

  he thrust the door but it held and he
knew the bar was down setting his great
shoulders against the planks he heaved
and heaved thrice before the bar burst from
its socket over the threshold he strode
and over the drunken bodies of the guard

  the dying coals glowed red in the fire-
pits casting a ruddy light over tables lit-
tered with empty dishes fouled platters
overturned ale cups gleaming like blood on
the drink-puddled floor the snoring of
besotted men disturbed the reeking air at
every step sigmund passed the sprawl-
ing body of some house-carl drunk and
drugged half under the tables officer lay
cheek by jowl with spearman counsellor
with serving-groom sneering sigmund
made for the bower

  his hand sought his sword only to drop
by his side this was the night of his ven-
geance the crown of his bleak bitter life
the yule feast had done its work his enemy
slept drunk unguarded by his snoring
house-carls the son of volsung meant to
slake this night the hate that had burned
his heart so many years he would not
bury his sword in siggeirs drugged body
that way the goth would never know who
slew him

  he would bear away the sleeping siggeir
as he had done the slain kol carry him off
to the depths of the forest and cherish him
till he woke then-sigmund thought of
his murdered father of his brothers torn
by the wolf of signy bound in wretched
io

adventure

wedlock to a coward all this he would
avenge this night-and he would win back
his precious sword whichsiggeir had shame-
fully stolen

   the bower lay behind the hall with direct
access to it in case of attack its door also
sigmund burst in and found the-room
dimly lighted by a single torch

  even as he followed the door inward
sigmund was aware of many forms that
leaped up from couches benches and skins
laid on the floor steel flashed mens
voices cried a confused alarm headlong
bewildered by sleep and surprize eight
house-carls rushed to meet the intruder

  sigmunds sword flashed he stood with
braced feet waiting the onset and as the
first blade met his he cried in a mighty
voico	

  volsung-

   at his shout the house-carls fell sudden-
ly back their faces blanched with terror
hands went to faces weapons clattered to
the floor sigmund understood to them
his face aged and seared by grief and hate
and by long solitude was not the face of
sigmund but ofsigmunds father and his
cry had sgemed to them the name of the
dead on a dead mans lips to them he
was volsungs ghost come from the grave
forvengeance he smiled dreadfully and
stalked across the bower to the royal couch
none moved to bar his way those nearest
him drew back as he passed by

   in the bed lay siggeir his wife by his side
close by in a little rough-carved bed slept
their second child siggeir slumbered heav-
ily with grunts and stertorous snores
mastered by the drugged ale signy lay
with eyes wide open smiling up at her
brother

  our night sigmund she whispered
and he bent to seize his sleeping foe the
sight of the hated face the thought of the
vengeance now in his hands set his heart
throbbing he thought no more of his god-
given sword he heeded nothing save his foe
his hands trembled with the excitement of
his triumph-trembled so that when he
would have sheathed his blade to free both
hands he scratched his left wrist with its
point at the touch of the sharp-ground
steel blood welled from the cut red against
his fair skin

  unheeding he dragged siggeir from the
bed but as he lifted the goth a shout rang
out in the bower-

  he bleeds he is no ghost only the
living bleed slay him

  it was the officer of the watch-radgeir
first spear of the house-carls

  sigmund must needs drop siggeir to draw
sword again and as he did so a gothic
spearman snatched siggeirs feet and drew
him swiftly away it was neatly done and
the king was out of immediate danger no
sooner was the way cleared than the house-
carls charged again furious that they had
been so nearly befooled

  sigmund met them fiercely mad to think
that he had not foreseen siggeir would for-
bid a few at least of his guards to drink
when he knew the rest might be too drunk
to defend him siggeir was a fox that al-
ways kept an earth open

  blade clashed with blade sigmund in the
corner between the royal couch and the
childs bed he must cut his way through
or perish for the house-carls blocked his way
to the door there was a window in the
wall above the couch but it was barred
out of the corner of his eye he saw signy
fling the warm furs from her and strain at
the window-bar it flew up and she threw
the window open

  leaping in sigmund thrust his point
through a house-carls throat his left hand
seized the corpse and hurled it full in the
faces of the nearest foes with the spring
of a mountain-cat he pounced upon the bed
snatched up the wakened and whimpering
boy and flung himself through the window
he had barely dragged the child through
after him when a cast spear flashed above
his head

  the baffled guards made some for the
door some to follow him by the window
but signy slammed the shutter to in their
faces in the moment needed to drag her
away and unbar it sigmund had reached
the stockade gate with his prey run back
the bars and made his escape

  the pursuers came back after a little
radgeir scowled at signy and pointed to
the drugged king

  when he awakes the officer said dark-
ly it will go ill with thee for this

  signy nodded thinking fast she feared
not death but she had no wish to die before
her vengeancewas fulfilled yet she could
contrive no plan to save herself when
siggeir knew that her brother-a living
man-had broken into the hall stolen theii
second child and all but carried off siggeir

vengeance



himself when radgeir reported that she
had helped sigmund escape-then the last
of her days would be numbered

  fate or her gods saved her
ijjji  hot with the chase radgeir went
to hunt drink and found it in
a half-empty cask in the hall
knowing not that his comrades there were
drugged-thinking their stupor but that of
drunken sleep-he drank deep calling to
his men to share the brew now that the
danger was past they drank and when
signy understood what had happened her
eyes glowed waiting only till the drug
had time to take effect she ran to the hall
leaving her husband asprawl on the bower
floor

  the eight house-carls lay in a heap where
they had fallen save for radgeir whose
eyes were just filming with the potion be-
fore he lost consciousness he saw her bend-
ing over him a grim smile on her lips and
he strove to focus his eyes to glare at her
she smiled as he slipped to the floor smiled
and shuddered for the task before her
pleased her little

  plucking radgeirs sword from its scab-
bard she thrust it through his throat
then having slain the other seven one by
one she cast the sword on the floor

  there are none to betray me now she
muttered i shall live-till siggeir dies

  she forced a drinking horn from the hand
of one of the slain carls filled it and bore it
back to the bower then lying down again
on the couch and drawing the furs over her
she drained the drugged liquor

  now even he can not suspect me she
smiled and flung the horn through the open
window

sigmund crouched in his cave
behind the brawling waterfall
his spirit was black within him
the dream of his life having
flaunted its red promise suddenly before
him had as suddenly ended in illusion it
was as gunnhild the witch had foretold
he had succeeded-in stealing the boy in
his one great venture to achieve his revenge
he had failed

  siggeir all but in his hands drugged
helpless had yet been too shrewd for him
not only that having captured the boy
and borne him all the way through the

forest sigmund had found this last hope

   

also vain in the lad had lain his one last
chance-the chance that signys son might
inherit the flaming spirit of volsung and
under sigmunds nurture prove the instru-
ment of vengeance but the boy was a
coward like his brother

  sigmund had endured his whimperings as
he strode with the child in his arms through
the bleak forest dawn he knew that even
strong men feared that haunted wood

  but when he set him down at last in the
cave the boy shrieked at the dim loom of
sigmunds figure and the gray light filter-
ing through upon his grim face and when
the son of volsung drew his sword to test
the lads power to endure steel the last of
signys sons buried his face in his arms and
whined for mercy

  thy mother has borne another coward
sigmund spoke in the dull tones of one who
sees his life turn to ashes it is an ill trick
of fate that her honest volsung blood is
weaker in her sons than the base blood of
siggeir now will i remove from the earth
the reproach that thy life casts upon her

siggeir is mad with grief
said valrun and in the forest
darkness sigmund smiled bitterly

  little comfort is that to my
sister who gives birth only to weaklings
thou hast slain him too

  sigmund felt the horror in the girls voice
would signy have had it otherwise
nay valrun answered better be
childless than have such sons she will say
thou hast done well but what is to be
done now she has no more sons to give
thee and if she had they would surely be
no better

  i know not sigmund answered slowly
last night was the end siggeir too cun-
ning to leave himself wholly unguarded
then will not be less shrewd another time
it is too great a task for one man and now
i have no more hope of another to help me
thou hast not signys high heart the
maid reproached him she still hopes i
am to tell thee that she will send thee one of
her women whom thou canst take to wife
and by whom thou mayest have a son equal
to thyself in valor

  sigmund started outcast that he was
of necessity alone friendless companion-
less he had never thought of a wife but
he nodded to himself in the darkness it
would be best-if it were possible-to beget


adventure

his own son a man in whom the blood of
volsung should run strong

  perchance this was what the witch had
meant with her riddle nor will thy
vengeance be fulfilled till thou hast the
help of one in whom volsungs blood is un-
tainted by siggeirs could it be so then
when his son grew to manhood he would be
a worthy comrade between them they
would find a way to revenge he thought
a moment frowning then-

  bid my sister see to it that she sends me
a woman without fear

  valrun smiled to herself the queen
bids me say that it will be the daughter of
noble folk whose sires have never fled nor
feared if she give thee a son thou shalt
have cause to rejoice in him

  my sister has a great heart

  well mayest thou say so son of vol-
sung never has the earth known such a
woman

  when will my bride come

  tomorrow night it will be easy in
the throes of grief for his son and his new
fears for himself siggeir heeds naught else
he is surrounded by his guards who are
allowed no drink farewell-be here to-
morrow an hour after dusk

chapter vii

one without fear

  hou hast a well-hid house

   the womans voice was low and
somewhat thick hard to understand she
spoke in the broad gothland tongue much
like sigmunds own but fuller-throated and
liarsh

  sigmund laid fagots in the cold fire-pit
and drew out flint and steel but the woman
groping for him in the darkness of the cave
seized his arm

  though i am come to be thy wife thou
knowest naught of me she said how
should there be love between us the
queen has ordered me and i obey but thou
shalt not see my face till i have learned to
love thee

  sigmund smiled

  when morning comes i can not fail to
see thee

  wait till then

  but it is cold without fire-too cold for
a woman

  she laughed harshly

  what care i for cold

  sigmunds heart swelled at her words
the winter air was bitter in the cave numb-
ing the limbs if this woman feared not the
chill of winter there would be little that she
would fear she should give him brave
sons

  ay why not not one son merely to
help him slay siggeir but many-as many
as the sons of volsung why should not
the house of volsung rise again from its
ruins in their children he would be great
in their strength as his father had been and
establish himself an empire here in goth-
land ay he would win back frakkland
and set his foot on the necks of kings

  his eyes sought to pierce the darkness of
the cave this woman who was to be his
wife was strong he knew that she had kept
pace with him through the forest needing
no help save the touch of his hand to guide
her and putting an arm about her shoul-
ders he found her strongly made yet he
longed to see her eyes that he might read
in them the nature of her heart

  thou art well-born he asked remem-
bering valruns words

  as well-born as thyself and of as brave
folk

  that is saying much dost thou fear
steel

  her answer was prompt and certain with
the quiet confidence of one who does not
boast-

  neither steel nor fire nor venom-and
least of all the strength of men

  then thou art a mate for me and
groping in the dark- he put his arm about
her and kissed her

  wed me by the holy sign of thor she
commanded and he obeyed making the
mark of the hammer above her head and
on his own breast

sigmund was awake with the f
first light that filtered late be-
hind the waterfall he rubbed
mmljb his eyes turned toward the wo-
mans place to see her face she was
gone

  long he called and sought her through the
forest but never again was he to hear that
low harsh voice nor to clasp her in his
arms

  a strange wife my sister gives me he
muttered as he made his weary way home-
ward at dusk he was very sorrowful for
vengeance

he loved her high spirit her utter fearless-
ness that had neither shrunk from him nor
endured his taming

  he was very lonely that night and lone-
lier in the long long years that passed be-
fore he again saw signy or heard the footfall
of valrun who came no more to the forest
to bring him tidings of his foe

  as his loneliness oppressed him so his
hate-which he had thought as great as a
man might feel and live-rose higher and
hotter against siggeir his heart deceived
in its hope of love grew bitterer in his
breast often he would wake from sound
sleep to find his hand clenched on his sword-
hilt with the swelling of his hatred came
not only new dreams of vengeance but also
a strange cold patience to wait for it till the
time was ripe

  many a night he stood on the verge of
the forest straining eyes and ears for sight
and sound of signy or the maid her mes-
senger-always with the faint hope that he
might find his wife who had come to him
unseen and left him unseen and always
with the hate for siggeir so strong within
him that it tasted salty on his tongue none
came to him no word was sent all he saw
was the far-off lights of the hall all he heard
the faint shrill echoes of the guard challeng-
ing some late-comer from the gate

  so passed eleven years and sigmunds
hair and golden beard were touched with
gray yet nothing broke his loneliness nor
fed his vengeance-hungry heart more
mercilessly than ever he hunted the out-
laws in the wood who would have fled and
left it utterly to him had they had any
other refuge

  only in the hot flurry of fight could he
find relief or joy in life and then it was but
the fierce swift-passing joy of the beast in
its kill and beneath all under his lonely
brooding and under the flashing redness of
fight burned that steady patient yet con-
suming flame of hate

  the life in the forest kept his limbs supple
and his sinews hard though his youth was
gone his face was printed deep with the
scores of his bitter thoughts so that it
seemed old and savage and the desperate
men that skulked in the thickets fled from
him in terror

  in the spring of the twelfth year when
the forest was spongy with the thaw and
the streams released from the fetters of the
ice rushed frothing between flooded banks

sigmund one soft night found valrun
waiting him as she had done so often years
ago with her was another there was a
moon that night and it was only by the
greatest stealth long after all save the
door-wards slept that the two had made
their way to him

  by the pale light sigmund saw the maids
face for the first time she was a girl no
longer her face was lined and the silver in
her hair was not all from the moon-beams

  but his eyes dwelt less on her than on the
boy by her side he was not yet eleven
but he looked fifteen so big and sturdy was
he his arms were full and firm his legs
thick and planted like twin towers the
eyes of him glittered in the moonlight rest-
ing full and steady on sigmunds fair of
hair he was with a large shapely head and
strong jaws

  what is this asked sigmund won-
dering

  thy son valrun answered take
him-he is worthy of thee

  sigmund stared at first uncomprehend-
ing then-

  my son he echoed and-my wife
she is well but she will not return to
thee

  she fears me then

  valrun laughed scornfully look upon
her son and thine and say if his mother
knew fear nay but she loves thee
then why does she hide from me-why
steal from my life the one joy it has known
valrun eyed him strangely mayhap
she knew that love would make thee forget
thy vengeance and she ran from him
before he could question her further

  the boy remained his bright eyes fixed
questioningly on his fathers

  wilt thou take me he asked his
voice was high as became his age but there
was no fear nor doubt in it

  but sigmund having been disappointed
twice was wary

  if i take thee he answered thou
shalt learn to know hunger cold and-
fear

  the boy put out his arms his face aglow
with eagerness

  take me then my father much have
i heard of fear but never have i found it
fain would i know what it is like

  this is fear said sigmund and draw-
ing his sword he laid its sharp edge on the
boys throat the lad moved not but


adventure

waited fascinated softly sigmund drew
the blade a little to one side so that drops
of blood beaded the white young skin

  the child laughed is that fear he
asked his voice scornful nay that is
pain which i know well it is not pleasant
but i have felt worse

  sigmund sheathed his sword

  how he questioned

  my mother she told me often that i
was destined for brave deeds and saying
that i must be hardened to pain if i would
become great she showed me pain daily
she burned me with fire made me sleep
without covering on winter nights scratched
me with steel

  and in all this thou hast not found fear

  the boy gave him back look for look
what is fear he retorted

  sigmund held out his hand

  come he said

  together they hastened through the for-
est the boy half-running to keep up with
his fathers long strides yet never did he
falter or ask for rest when they reached
the cave sigmund lifted his son to its
mouth and bade him lie down on his own
bearskin

  what is thy name he asked

   sinfiotli

  tomorrow sinfiotli i will show thee
fear

  when morning came sigmund took him
by the hand and led him to the brook
there among the stones the father searched
long and at last he said

  run back to the cave and fetch me
flour from the bag that hangs on the wall
make haste

  while sinfiotli was gone sigmund bent
down among the stones of the stream-bed
and with a motion swift as thought seized
a viper that was sunning there his great
fingers held the creature just behind the
head so that it could not twist to strike
forcing its mouth open with his knife he
tore out its fangs

  when sinfiotli came running back sig-
mund took the flour from him wrapped in
birch-bark pinning the bark together with
a thorn so that it made a dish he stirred
the flour till it was all mixed-acorn meal
with the ground inner bark of the birch-
cupped water into the dish forced the
writhing viper into the dough and kneaded
it into a spongy mass the boy looked on
with eager eyes

 knead thou commanded sigmund
taking his own hands from the dough

  sinfiotli laughed

  one does not knead poisonous serpents
with good bread

  dost thou fear then

  pain clutched sigmunds heart for he
loved the boy already his own son who
feared not steel fire nor cold was a crawl-
ing viper to prove him a coward though
it cost him dear sigmund half drew his
sword if his son was afraid he must die
as siggeirs sons had died

  but sinfiotli thrust his hands into the
dough and kneaded vigorously despite the
vipers struggles once its head broke
through the smothering dough and with
desperation it struck at the boys hand
laughing sinfiotli pushed it back

  enough cried sigmund beyond him-
self with relief and joy he tore the dish
from his sons hands and caught him in his
arms

  thou art mine indeed blood of my
blood and heart of my heart no fear is in
thee thou art of the true volsung stuff
and volsung spirit

  as he kissed the boy he was overwhelmed
by the swift memories that the eager young
face brought to his mind the strong firm
features the broad heavy-boned face the
sparkling eyes-all recalled to him his own
father and all were sigmunds own as he
had been long ago sigmund trembled with
pure joy as the two went home together

  that day began the boys training al-
ready so inured to pain that he laughed
at it sinfiotli quickly learned to live as
his fathers son must live daily the two
hunted together swam together in the cold
woodland streams together scaled the
rough tree-clad crags armed with bow
and spear they faced the bear surly with
its spring hunger they turned on the wolf-
pack and beat it back sinfiotli striking out
with his light spear with ready hand and
lip curled in defiance in danger the lad
laughed aloud and bore his own part for
all his tender years

  for hours each day sigmund taught him
the use of weapons now and again giving
him slight cuts that his son might learn to
face steel without wincing nor did he flinch
once what he learned he had many an
opportunity to put to use for sigmund took
him out often against the outlaws who now
were driven out of all but the least accessible
vengeance



crags of the wild forest where they stood
desperately at bay with the passing
months and years sinfiotli grew ever more
skilful and the growing swiftness and
strength of him caused the father to marvel
and rejoice

  truly it is a young champion that i
have begotten he cried to his heart and
he longed with a mighty longing to find and
cherish the wife that had given him such a
child

        when the youth reached man-
        hood sigmund told him of his
        destiny but sinfiotli flexing his
        mighty arms made answer

  all this my mother told me now have
i spent nine years with thee my father and
ever have i waited for thee to tell me when
we shall go out to slay our enemy i had
come to think thou hadst forgotten
sigmund stared at him thou knowest
-all thou wilt help me kill siggeir
sinfiotli ground his teeth together his
young face twisted with rage do i not
know he cried all the treason of siggeir
have i not thy sufferings and my grand-
sires death to avenge so soon as i could
talk my mother told me daily of the wrongs
of my kindred wilt thou never take me
to slay that dog of a goth

  the father marvelled how the woman he
had known but for a night should have so
felt his wrongs that she had trained her
child from its cradle to hate his enemies
how could she who had not time to love
her husband and had abandoned him so
burn with fury against siggeir yet in his
heart he remembered valruns words of her
she loves thee

  what is thy mothers name he asked
nor was this the first time he had put the
question

  sinfiotli answered as he had done before-
she bade me keep it from thee nor does
one of volsungs blood break his word
sigmund bit his lip he was a hard man
and liked not to be crossed but he knew it
was right that his son should keep faith
when he spoke it was to answer sinfiotlis
earlier question-

  in courage and in skill thou art ready
now to be my comrade but there is yet
one fault in thee thou hast no prudence
i was once even as thou art-rash headlong
in fight heeding not what wounds i took if
i might but destroy my foe misfortune

and years taught me caution some men
gain it through fear but thou hast no fear
and art too young to learn from anothers
lips how to join shrewdness with courage
until thou art warier thou wilt be as
dangerous to friend as to foe siggeir is so
cunning that valor alone is not enough to
overcome him i fear the outcome if i let
thee face him now

  sinfiotli leaped to his feet his eyes eager
if caution is all i lack then teach me cau-
tion now

  his father smiled that thou must
learn through suffering my son come
we will go out and see if thou canst learn

  they put on their mail and girded on
their weapons

  this birnie is tight for me sinfiotli
grumbled and sigmund looking saw that
his son had grown bigger of girth and limb
than himself

  eastward four hours march through the
forest lay a jumbled welter of cliff and
ravine where streams swollen with spring
thaws had cut a tortuous way through sheer
granite

  masses of jagged rock overhung the deep
stream-beds and trees whose roots found
scant nourishments in the stony soil had
fallen in confusion among the boulders
there were no trails dense undergrowth
had sprung up to fill the gaps left by the
fallen forest giants here in caves in the
walls of a wild gorge dwelt that hardy rem-
nant of the outlaws whom sigmund had
driven from their lairs in the forest sound
wind and strong limbs must he have who
would reach them here courage and keen
eyes as well to evade ambush hither
sigmund led his son that he might learn
caution

  till now we have hunted together
sigmund said as they approached the out-
law fastness now we hunt apart each
of us will fight his own battles unless he
meets more than seven men i have faced
and slain ten but i am old in the craft of
war thou reckless as thou art canst not
stand against so many so let whichever
of us first meets more than his match give
the wolf-howl and the other will come to
his help more than seven i hold to be too
many

  sinfiotli was off like an arrow dodging
and twisting through the undergrowth
for a while sigmund watched the bushes
shake and close behind him but soon he
adventure

was lost to sight in the broken ground
turning sigmund set about his own hunt-
ing

  he had not far to seek half-climbing
half-crawling to the edge of the ravine he
gazed down into its depths and there far
down he saw a fine stag drinking from a
swirling pool as he gazed an arrow
feathered in the stags flank and two men
bounded out from a fringe of willows that
edged the stream

  casting his cumbrous shield aside sig-
mund set about the descent from ledge
to ledge he crawled finding precarious foot-
hold on the slippery rocks helping himself
with one hand whenever a sturdy root or
overhanging branch offered safe grip he
was safe from arrows for the gorge was too
high and narrow for a fair shot but as he
reached the last ledge and turned to jump
down one of the hunters launched a savage
spear-thrust

  sigmund saved himself by a quick side-
leap that threw him on his face instantly
the two flung themselves on him one he
struck in the face with his upflung foot as
the man reeled back sigmund turned on
one side and launched his own spear in
that moment the second man drove a knife
at his throat the blade glanced on sig-
munds mailed arm and slashed his wrist
then he was up his sword out

  his spear-thrust had missed but now he
was on his feet the two would not face him
they gave way leaping into the shallows
casting quick glances about them for a way
of escape sigmund pressed them close-so
close that they grew desperate one rushed
in sword flashing the other whistled
shrilly twice and fitted arrow to string
though the range was too short for safety

  the rocks rang with answering whistles
shouts rang from behind and above stones
pelted down about sigmunds ears from
both sides he paused one instant threw
back his head and howled like a wolf then
he rushed upon the first two his blade
split one mans skull even as the other
loosened his shaft which sped harmless
over sigmunds shoulder straightway sig-
mund was on him and beneath his guard
the death-stroke went home but before
he could wrench out his sword sigmund
crashed down in a rocky pool flung head-
long by a stone between the shoulders

  he expected death for though he could
not see them he knew the outlaws were all

about him up he staggered his back
against the wall of the gorge his legs in
water to the thighs head sheltered by an
out-jutting ledge and here sinfiotli hasten-
ing to answer his fathers summons found
him the young mans sword was red

  four i slew on the rim of the ravine he
boasted proudly art thou hurt
sigmund shook his head

  thou hast done well he praised the
lad they have fled from thee now go
about thy hunting and call me if thou
needest such help as thou hast given me
when sinfiotli had disappeared once
more sigmund angry and ashamed at his
failure to take care of himself beat through
the ravine all day long seeking any who
would face him but the outlaws had had
enough no man showed his head toward
sunset he clambered to the ridge again
the exertion of his climb drove the anger
from his brain he began to wonder why he
had heard nothing more from his son

  striking south along the crest he came
upon the lads track it was easy to follow
for sinfiotli had blundered through the
thickets like an angry bull and sigmund
was wise in the ways of the forest for an
hour he tracked his son till the sky was red
and the dusk settling at last descending
into a little clearing he found him

sinfiotli lay under a great
oak that stood alone in the clear-
ing he was sound asleep his
arms flung wide and his mail un-
braced and both hands were red with blood
three burly outlaws sprawled dead about
his feet and others dotted the clearing
sigmund counted twelve slain in all they
had died hard for sinfiotlis shield was
hacked to pieces his mail rent the ground
about him stuck with arrows and broken
spear-shafts

  sigmund shook him awake

  fool he cried as the exhausted cham-
pion opened heavy eyes fool when a
man goes forth to learn caution does he
engage twelve men without calling for help
and having slain them would any but a
madman lie down to sleep in their country
within sight of their friends verily it
would be better for us both if thou couldst
feel a little fear

  sinfiotli was angry i am as thou didst
make me he retorted do thou be cau-
tious for both of us and i will fight for both
vengeance



  for a moment father and son glared at
each other then sigmund laughed though
without much mirth

  if i wait for thee to get wisdom we shall
never slay siggeir i will take thee as thou
art and may odin help us both we go
forth to seek our vengeance as soon as thou
art healed of thy wounds

chapter viii

fear comes

i ate of a hot moonless night the two
drew near the garth of siggeir and
sinfiotli reckless with lust for battle would
have stalked boldly forward to the gate
his father caught him by the arm

  hast thou not yet learned that one man
cannot slay fifty he rebuked him we
must do this thing with cunning

  sinfiotli grumbled but obeyed softly
with infinite stealth the two crept toward
the stockade close they drew and closer
till with a sudden run they reached the
gate-posts and crouched behind the wall
one on either side of the gate

  from where they lurked they heard the
boasting and laughter of the guards
picked house-carls were these as was plain
from their bragging

  on such a night said one we bear the
fate of this kingdom in our hands when
the moon shines not foes bestir themselves
and good guards are needed were an
enemy to come i would slay six with my
own hand as i did once in denmark
another laughed somewhat scornfully
thou art a brave man thorleif he said
but a hireling and a foreigner here in
gothland we have no foes the whole is-
land is siggeirs such enemies as he has
must come from afar in ships and deal with
the coast-guard before they can threaten us
were not our king a coward he would post
no sentries here at his gate for none of
gothland dare attack him

  thorleif a champion new-hired from den-
mark grunted at this news

  then why must we bide here he asked
there is good ale and meat in the kitchen
let us go thither the king will not ask for
us

  a low murmur rose at his words but one
of the house-carls thirsty with the summer
heat backed him eagerly

  we will leave one man he proposed

to stand watch while the others go in
the order determined by the dice we will
return one by one relieving the watcher
and so we will do till all are satisfied

  the two lurking in the dark smiled to
themselves and still more when the guards
fell to dicing by the light cast from the hall
to settle which should first remain behind
quarrels there were and low curses ere
the lot fell first to the dane with good-
natured mockery the others left him

  no sooner had they disappeared when
sinfiotli sprang up and tapped softly at the
gate

  who comes the dane challenged and
the young man answered

  news for the king open swiftly and
make no noise it is not for the ears of all
gothland

  having just been assured that siggeir had
no enemy in all the kingdom the dane did
not hesitate the bars grated and the gate
opened sinfiotli was inside in a single
bound his hands locked about the danes
throat so that he could not give the alarm
the watchfire being between them and the
hall none saw the braggart did not slay
his six men that night he was dead in
an instant

  softly now sigmund whispered as his
son eased the corpse down thrust him
outside the garth where they will not see
him now creep up to the porch if any
come drop to the ground

  the hall door was open for the heat with-
in where a dozen torches blazed was too
great for comfort a path of light lay along
the steps and over the floor of the four-
square porch with its carven pillars but
to the left of the door was a space where no
light fell for here were two great ale-tuns
empty and thrust out to air behind these
the two of volsungs kindred hid watching
their chance raising their heads from shel-
ter now and again to peer into the hall

siggeir sat not on his high
seat but at one of the benches
below the dais his head cupped
in one hand across the table
on which was bread and ale signy was busy
with her needle two children-her last-
born-played about the rough pine floor
with a toy that glittered yellow in the torch-
light it was a pretty golden thing that
rolled at a touch and made a merry tinkling
as it moved
adventure

  sigmund touched his sons shoulder
be wary he whispered move not till
i give the word i have tinder and dry
bark in my pouch but if they see or hear us

first-

  sinfiotli impatient ever and chafing at
the implied rebuke raised his head again to
watch his enemy siggeir sat like one over-
burdened with sadness he was an old
man now broken with age and sorrow but
he had lost none of his cowards love of life
now and again he raised his head and
glanced with a smile at his boys but when
his eyes fell on signy they gleamed frostily
the last years of their life together had been
still less happy than the first

  five fine sons might i have had he
spoke in sudden bitterness hadst thou 
watched thy children with a mothers love
five sigmund whispered two slain
two here but the fifth

  ten brave brothers might i have had
signy retorted quietly hadst thou been an
honest man

  as she spoke the elder child gave his toy a
sharp push which set it rolling swiftly
sigmund smothered a curse for the thing
rolled straight toward the porch where they
lay hid and after it raced the two lads
shouting gaily in their shrill young voices

  sigmund poised on hands and toes would
have slipped out of sight but sinfiotli in-
cautiously raised his head higher to see how
close the toy would come even as his
helmet rose above the cask the bauble went
tinkling past him and down the steps and
the older boy following caught sight of the
steel crest gleaming in the torchlight he
stepped forward a little to see the better
and was suddenly aware of two huge men
grim of face full-armed with a scream
the child ran to his father the younger fol-
lowing after in uncomprehending fear

  there are men outside with weapons
the child cried and siggeir leaped to his
feet swiftly he snatched a horn from the
wall behind him and blew a frantic blast

  straightway sigmund and sinfiotli sprang
through the door shields up and swords out
but sigmund tripped and fell sprawling over
the threshold and his son paused to raise
him up ere they could reach the king a
flood of house-carls raced down from the
loft and burst into the hall with a tremen-
dous clanking of steel

  back to back sigmund shouted and
the two confronted their foes hopeless of

vengeance now but set on selling their lives
dearly as the house-carls rushed them a
dozen others-the guard summoned from
the kitchens by the shouting and clangor-
poured in from the porch

  the two volsungs struck out manfully
fighting more to make a good end than to
win and wheresoever their blades fell a
man went down but they were outnum-
bered thirty to one with ever fresh forces
pouring in to aid their foes signy sat in
an agony of fear for her kinsmen while the
struggling house-carls knocked against her
in their efforts to close

  sinfiotli joying in the give and take of
fight made his blade play like the hammer
of thor his young face was aflame his
mighty arms seemed never to tire his
father as strong but older spared his
strength with cunning dealing more thrusts
than cuts and slashing from the wrist
twelve good men they slew before the sheer
weight of their foes swept them from their
feet and they were overwhelmed by the
surge of many men piling upon them when
the heap once more separated itself and rose
from off them they were disarmed and
bound

  signy still sat at her bench-the only seat
in the hall left unbroken by the savage
struggle and her eyes were bitter but
siggeir came forth from the bower where he
had hidden a grin of triumph on his still pale
face his legs still trembled under him as
he made his uncertain way to his enemies
and gazed upon them with mockery mixed
with amazement

  the one he said slowly striving to
control the fear in his voice the one has
the face of volsung only bleaker the other
is like sigmund in his youth but sigmund
must be old now-ha

  thou art sigmund he cried pointing
at his life-long foe age cannot hide thee
from me the gods have dealt unkindly
with thee as with me son of volsung little
joy hast thou had in life ay and less joy
shalt thou have in death

  turning to sinfiotli he stared at the
young man with wonder on his face thou
shouldst be his son for thou hast the look
of him as he once was and yet-there is
something about thee that i seem to know
who art thou

  sigmunds son and thy worst hater
sinfiotli snarled at him now are the
last of volsungs race in thy hands thou
vengeance



false coward but though thou doom us to
fire or rope we shall yet win free and slay
thee

  long siggeir laughed at him with the
wheezing laugh of age

  such a death have i in mind for you
twain he chuckled as even a volsung can-
not escape ho lofmund bid the carls
dig a pit deep and steep of side with such
covering as i shall show you how to make
all through the night tie condemned men
heard the clinking of mattocks and shovels
and at dawn they were led to their living
grave siggeir had caused to be dug a pit
ten feet deep with sides shelving out at the
bottom and into this they were thrust
their bands unbound that they might at-
tempt the hopeless task of escape and so
suffer the more

  then siggeirs house-carls covered them
over with a roof of beams thatched with
straw and upon this he had earth heaped
high they were buried alive in a grave-
mound of the sort fashioned for dead heroes
nor was this the worst of their torments
the roof was so contrived that a single nar-
row shaft faced with square stones bedded in
earth let in the air and light of day far above
them

  the captives sat in their gloomy prison
and after a while sigmund said to his son
i warned thee to be wary but thou didst
not heed and from thy rashness comes
death to us both death without that
vengeance for which i have lived through
lonely years and bitter griefs-in vain
the shaft above them darkened and a
thin laugh grated on their ears

  death the voice of siggeir echoed
ay such a death there is air enough to
keep you alive while hunger wastes those
mighty limbs and the fires of thirst eat
slowly slowly at your throats ye have
plotted and lurked and dared-in vain in
vain i live and the kin of volsung dies-
dies forever he withdrew leaving them
to their despair

  the scant light that thrust down to them
left the face of each but a white blur to the
others eyes their voices seemed muffled by
the damp earth walls long they sat
silent then suddenly sinfiotli spoke-

  a vile death for a warrior

  sigmunds ears were quick to catch the
tiny quaver in his sons voice-the first
he had ever heard there a grim smile
twitched on his lips

  now he answered thou hast learned
at last the need of caution a pity thou
hadst not known it a day sooner yet the
fault is mine i loved thee because thou
didst never know fear but now i know that
a little fear is a good thing in a man for it
makes him prudent be of good heart my
son if we may escape this pit our chance of
slaying our foe is better than-ever before
there is no escape muttered sinfiotli
who knows my sister yet lives and
loves me and now that siggeir is sure of our
helplessness he will relax his guard why
think you did he keep men at the gate and
so strong a company of house-carls ever
about him when there was neither war nor
chance of war against him

  why when to maintain so great a force
costs much gold-and siggeir holds his
gold well nigh as dear as his blood be-
cause he feared me ay though he thought
me dead he feared me-because he did not
know me dead but now he regards us both
as dead indeed or dying and he will watch
no more

  much good we get of that the young
man answered hopelessly we must lie
here weaker and weaker with each passing
hour the moisture dtying in our throats our
tongues swelling-till we die of feebleness
or go mad with thirst by all the gods
could i but lay my fingers about that evil
dotards neck

  keep that thought uppermost in thy
mind sigmund said and we shall yet
win thou canst count on signy once
before she saved my life when siggeir
deemed me as good as dead and it will be
easier for her now that he is reckless with
confidence

  sinfiotli was not cheered for hours he
sat sullen and silent nor could sigmund
rouse him the patch of blue sky above
them grew dull before he spoke again but
at last he leaped to his feet

  let us not bide our death like dogs he
cried let me stand on thy shoulders my
father so that i may work at yonder hole
in the roof

  so thou hast thought of that sigmund
laughed be sure siggeir thought of it
too and guarded against it nevertheless
i will help thee try

  supported on the older mans shoulders
sinfiotli groped with his fingers at the stone-
faced shaft he could scarce see at all for
daylight was dying fast he was very


adventure

thirsty impatiently he fumbled for the
chinks between the stones prying at them
with all his strength his nails broke his
fingers were gashed and bleeding yet no
single stone was the looser for all his toil
so tight did the squared stones press the
earth between them that his finger-tips
would not enter

  on and on he worked little heeding the
pain his thoughts all on freedom revenge
and-water most of all he craved water
to ease the burning in his throat his
breath came whistling through his mouth
forced open by the hard toil and all his
fruitless labor brought him only greater
thirst in despair he thrust his arm up the
shaft to learn its depth what he found
finished his courage and his hope

  let me down he gasped here we
must die

chapter ix

the sword returns

tt e was no sooner down than something
- fell after him striking his shoulder
he looked up but all was black overhead
night had come while he labored it was
sigmund whose searching hands found what
had fallen

  this is signys work he muttered
stand back-there may be more to fol-
low

  there was some weighty thing fell with
a thud between the desperate men and once
more sigmund seized it but it was the
fighter object that he examined first

  here is food and drink he cried
sinfiotli sprawled over him in his haste to
drink sigmund casting aside the cloths
that wrapped the bundle handed him a
small flask and a packet of cold meat sin-
fiotli drank with eager gulps spilling a little
in his lust for the cooling water but his
father neither ate nor drank till he had
opened the heavier packet at the touch
of it he gasped

  a sword he exulted ay-that same
matchless sword that i tore from the bran-
stock long ago i can tell it by the feel
of the hilt siggeir must indeed deem
us helpless if signy could beguile that
from him 

  calmness returning he ate and drank so
much of the water as his son had left hav-
ing finished-

  now he said to work give me thy
shoulder this time

  sinfiotli made no delay he was too eager
for deliverance from the ghastly death that
threatened them standing on his shoul-
ders sigmund supported himself with one
hand against the edge of the shaft while
with the sword in his other hand he dug
steadily and with utmost care

  the good steel bit deep into the earth
between the stones which no fingers could
penetrate and soon he felt the lowest stone
settle those above held fast gripped by
the pressure of the earth about them
wrenching at the loosened stone he pulled it
free dropped it clear of his son and worked
at the next now and again the sword
struck stone but the fine blade did not
break

the work went on slowly but
ceaselessly ever and again sig-
mund would descend to let his
son rest but he would never al-
low the impatient youth to take his place
nor let the precious sword leave his own
hands

  it was his again with it his youth seemed
to return to him hope and confidence
were his once more with the noble weapon
which he believed odin had given him
with it luck had passed from siggeirs hand
to his

  the night was far spent when the stone
facing removed block by block a rush of
dirt through the shaft spattered and blinded
both men winking the earth from his eyes
sigmund attacked the lighter part of his
task with a warning to his son

  head down iad when i speak let me
down and hug the side of the pit

  he slashed mightily at the earthen shaft
wider now and ever-increasing runlets of
dirt trickled over his shoulders suddenly
he leaped down with a cry of warning a
small landslide following him now hav-
ing worked out all the filling between two
of the roof-beams he once more climbed
to sinfiotlis shoulders feeling the heavy
wood with his finger-tips-for he could
barely reach it-he knew that freedom lay
close at hand

  up-on tiptoe he commanded with
a grunt of effort sinfiotli obeyed as he
heaved up sigmund left his shoulders with
a leap and caught at the roof-beams which
he could not see
vengeance



  well had his cunning fingers marked their
position he caught them fairly and drew
himself up by sheer strength an effort
that tried his shoulder-muscles a brace of
kicks at the sliding face of the shaft and he
was up-free in the clean air of night

  he glanced around no one was near
siggeir had indeed relaxed his vigilance of
thirty years swiftly sigmund bent to the
two exposed roof-beams and with all his
might wrestled to tear them free of the
heaped earth that covered all but that little
of their length above the shaft in vain
the weight upon them was too great how
was he to get his son out

  sinfiotli solved that riddle his words
barely carrying to his fathers ears the
young man bade him stand aside and tossed
up the sword through the hole with it
sigmund fell to work to clear the beams and
at last had one free up-ending it he
thrust it down into the pit bracing the
lower end against the earthen wall sinfiotli
climbed up sigmund helping him as he
struggled to the top

  free the father exulted and i
have my sword the gift of all-father
odin

  i am weaponless sinfitoli muttered

  bide here till i fetch thee a blade
and sigmund set off in the night

  he made straight for the palisade reck-
ing but little of such guards as might be
posted sure that he would find few or none
had not siggeir in his new confidence been
heedless enough to let the famous sword out
of his keeping would he not then be
heedless in other things also

  sigmund was right two men only held
the gate nor did they hold it long having
listened to their talk and learned how few
they were he ran along the stockade till he
was out of their hearing and scaled it
swiftly

  crawling upon them from behind he slew
them with two strokes so close together that
one had scarcely seen the others head leap
from his shoulders than he too was dead
snatching up the sword of one sigmund ran
back where his son waited

  once armed sinfiotli felt all his hope and
courage revive but there was no more
recklessness in him he plucked at his
fathers arm

  lead on he urged this time i will
not fail thee i have learned fear and with
it wisdom

they made swift progress to-
ward the gate entered without
resistance and encountered no
 man till they reached the hall
once more the door was open as on the
night before two more guards were there
but these slept at their posts not only
the king but all his folk had felt the fear of
a generation roll from them when as they
thought sigmund lay helpless waiting a
sure death beneath the earth

  slaying the guards they dragged the
bodies aside and hastened round the build-
ing to the rear of the bower where they
waited for dawn it was soon upon them
for their escape had taken most of the night

  as soon as he could see well sigmund
took from his pouch a bundle of birch bark
dry and ragged and striking flint on steel
he caught the precious sparks and blew
them in the heart of the papery wood
when the bark was blazing he laid it in a
chink of the pine wall where the moss had
fallen out then they stood watching till
the flame had caught well

  running to the outside stair that led
down from the loft they set its planks
alight so that there might be no escape for
any within save through the main hall door
thither they hurried again and took their
stand one on each side of the entrance

  when they come sigmund ordered
strike fast and hard

  in ten minutes the tinder-dry building
was aroar with flames on rear and side the
crackling and the smoke-blown by the
wind through every chink-woke those
within shouts of alarm rang out running
feet pounded in the loft and scant-clad
figures dashed into the hall to learn their
peril at sight of those grim figures at the
door the frightened house-carls howled in
fury

  the bower-door burst open giving vent
to a stream of wailing folk first of all ran
siggeir moaning and wringing his hands
when he beheld the face of sigmund grin-
ning at him through the smoke-wreaths he
shrieked aloud in terror foam flecked his
ups he fell on his knees entreating pity

  close on his heels rushed valrun with
the kings two sons she was pale but her
eyes gleamed the children screamed and
tearing away their hands from her clasp
fled for the door sinfiotu thrust them
roughly back

  last of au scorning to run the queen


adventure

came from the blazing bower with stately
dignity one glance she gave to her abject
husband and her lips curled as she turned
her back on him her children flung them-
selves upon her wailing and clutching at her
skirts

  get from me ye cowards she cried
and snatched her gown from them ye
betrayed my brother to his foes

  thus far the house-carls restrained by
discipline had waited for orders from their
king but seeing him broken and terrified
they were on the point of bolting to save
their own lives ulfgeir threw himself be-
fore them armed with an ax

  in column-two by two he cried ho
asbiorn and asleif raise the king and
help him hence we will cut a way through
for him

  valrun flung herself on her brothers
breast

  if thou save this worthless nidering
she screamed thou shalt never see my face
again

  he strove to put her aside but she clung
to him torn between his loyalty and his
love for her the unhappy officer stood for
one moment the restless house-carls fast
forgetting his orders in their fear for them-
selves they wavered broke and rushed
in a masfe for the door nor did they take
the wretched king with them

  blinded and choked by smoke scorched
by the tongues of fire that licked in at the
windows and curled round the logs of the
wall they were in no mood for steadiness
they poured in a torrent toward the one
way out where the two avengers waited
with drawn swords unarmored-their
mail left behind in their flight from the loft
-armed with such weapons as they could
snatch from the hot walls the carls charged
in blind panic

  in their frenzy they heeded not the nar-
rowness of the doorway by their very mass
as their flanks smashed against the door-
posts they piled up in a crushed and broken
heap into that heap licked the blades of
sigmund and sinfiotli making red work in
the glow of the onsurging flame

  that narrow door made to stand siege
would have enabled the two to beat off
many times their number even had both
sides been matched in weapons but now
their swords ripping through unarmored
sides the volsungs cut the milling mass to
pieces and drove it back shattered

  those who survived re-formed and came
on again fewer now but more deadly hav-
ing learned their lesson their weight
would have borne the avengers back had
not sigmund with a swift shout to his son
let them through and leapt to one side as
they poured past the two terrible assailants
closed in smiting them down from behind
some turned to resist and fell swiftly the
greater part overcome with fear fled as
fast as they could through the gate of the
stockade

  the whole back of the hall was now
aflame fire and smoke rolling forward to
engulf the building the two volsungs
farthest from its onrush still held their post
untroubled siggeir scarce able to stand
but driven on by fear of death tottered
toward the entrance in ulfgeirs arms while
valrun plucked fiercely at her brothers
hands

  come out called sigmund all shall
live save siggeir alone

  siggeir thrust out both his hands spare
me he moaned his bearded chin trem-
bling his smoke-red eyes dropping tears
spare me sigmund i will heap you with
gold half the kingdom will i give-

  sigmund laughed bitterly wilt thou
give back my father and my brothers he
mocked naught will i take at thy hands
save thy life i have grown old hating thee
thou murderer and coward now vengeance
is in my hands thou shalt die-not by
sword but by fire and the house of vol-
sung shall live

ulfgeir ever faithful heaved
up his ax to cleave a way for
his master valrun would have
stopped him but he flung her to
the floor sigmunds sword flashed and
the ax-head dropped cut away from its
helve with a cry of despair the brave
officer drew his knife and plunged it into
his own breast

  shrieking valrun flung herself upon him
his blood reddening her robe signy bent
above them striving to drag her maid away

  come out signy cried sigmund thy
sons with thee signy came but she
paused not for the two boys they fol-
lowed snatching at her and crying pit-
eously after them staggered siggeir weep-
ing the flames raced toward them as they
ran with a roar and a fearful insuck of hot
air and smoke the roof fell in behind them
vengeance



  overcome with fright the king screamed
aloud and rushed on the swords of his
foes sigmund met him with raised point
but such was the goths fear of the flames
that he gripped the steel till his hand was
cut to the bone when sigmund hurled
him back the old mans fingers were almost
severed

  signy brushed past him beating at her
scorched gown the children followed her
to the porch she turned and pointed a
scornful finger at them

  shall the little snakes outlive the old
viper she cried slay them lest i be
called mother of cowards

  and sinfiotli seizing one in each hand
flung the boys far into the seething fire

  out into the court the three retreated
from the fearful heat leaving siggeir
crouched by the threshold signy caught
her brothers hand in hers

  well hast thou avenged our father sig-
mund she cried and her eyes were bright
and fierce verily i love thee now more
than ever before and save for one other
none have i loved but thee these many
years

  she kissed him and the little flames ran
toward her along the planks of the porch
she glanced back over her shoulder and
saw valrun the maid still knelt above
her brother but her face was turned toward
sigmund and his son there was a glad
proud look in her eyes even while the tears
rolled down her cheeks

  the walls will topple soon said signy
this is the end

  bid valrun come forth sigmund urged
stay-i will go for her

  signy drew him back nay it is her
wish to die she has had all that life can
give

  he sprang past her valrun rose as if to
meet him her face transfigured but as he
crossed the threshold she drove her broth-
ers knife into her breast and fell lifeless
above ulfgeirs corpse groaning sigmund
went back

  as he reached his son and sister the walls
bulged and sinfiotli caught the woman
about the waist

  back mother he cried the porch
will fall this way

  sigmund turned on his son staring

  mother he echoed meanest
thou-

  signy flung her arms round the young

mans neck nay she denied he
knows not yonder lies thy mother child
she pointed to the bleeding form of val-
run almost surrounded by the the raging
flame

  it was valrun who came to thee in the
forest sigmund she loved thee and for
that reason would not stay with thee lest
love of her should make thee forget thy
vengeance ah cunningly we contrived it
knowing that i bore only cowards i sent
her to thee when her time came we
wrought so prudently that siggeir believed
us when we said the child was mine he
was brought up as my son that he might be
stirred to greater hatred of siggeir by my
wrongs and thine

  this we did that thou mightest have
a worthy comrade and our kindred be
avenged now let me go for i must die
with my husband i have hated him all my
life but i am his wife and it is fitting i
should perish with him

  sinfiotli held her close and sigmund
pleaded with her but at that moment sig-
geir rose from the burning threshold and-
his clothing ablaze-rushed out into the
garth

  the madness of fear lent him strength
ere any could stop him he was half-way to
the gate sigmund snatched at him  as he
flew by but too late whirling sinfiotli
loosed signys arms and caught the goth
by his flapping robes bearing him back to
the porch he heaved the old king up and
hurled him far into the blazing hall

  sigmund cried out suddenly a terrible
cry of rage and grief signy had sped past
them and run back into the doomed building

  farewell brother and nephew she
called

  father and son drew back from the heat
slowly their eyes wet with tears that were
not all of the smoke long they stood by
the gate the posts of which were already
smoldering

  at last sigmund raised ids bloody sword
on high

  i prayed to thee for vengence father
odin he cried with shaking voice be-
hold thou hast given it me taking wife and
sister for thy price a bitter god art thou

  sinfiotli looked on him and then at the
embers which were the grave of all that they
both held dear

  an evil thing he muttered an evil
thing is vengeance

yfrreaders writersandaavevturew

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land	

    perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

    if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

you will remember that at a
recent camp-fire talbot mundy
told us his conception of julius
caesar-his reasons for portray-
ing caesar as he does in his stories of tros
of samothrace i upbraided myself for
having meekly accepted the usual estimate
of caesar without ever having considered
how much of that usual estimate is based
on caaesars own estimate of himself in his
commentaries without ever having care-
fully studied the other authorities and
data on which that estimate is based and
without ever having tried to reason out a
conclusion of my own from whatever data
i did possess

  in a word i was disgusted with myself
for having been a sheep whether caesars
character was this or that is of no great
moment to me but this instance of my

having accepted anybodys opinion on any-
thing without at least attempting to do
some research and reasoning of my own
was of moment to me like most other
people i far too often do accept opinions
without thinking for myself but i am
ashamed of it and when in this particular
case mr mundy suddenly presented to me
a different estimate arrived at by inde-
pendent thinking it was not only a chal-
lenge but an accusation and i plead guilty
and expressed regret

  my plea was for an open mind and
independent thinking i endorsed very
strongly mr mundys open-mindedness
and independence but i stated definitely
and specifically that i did not swallow his
theory whole and that it might be wrong in
whole or part to me the important point
was not the correctness or incorrectness


the camp-fire



of his theory but the fact that right or
wrong he had refused to accept any-
thing not proven to the satisfaction of his
own reasoning power but had got hold of
available sources and formed his own opin-
ion whereas i-like most of the rest of you-
hadnt done any thinking myself but with-
out questioning just accepted the usual
estimate without being really able to back-
up that estimate i have much more re-
spect for mr mundy even if his theory is
all wrong than i have for myself who merely
swallowed what some one else handed me
even if it happened to be right-or for you
if you swallowed it with an equal lack of
independent thinking

  having swallowed the usual estimate
without thinking and being ashamed of
having done so i declined either to swal-
low or to reject mr mundys estimate
without thinking and i dragged out the old
estimate and said-

  here maybe youre right and maybe
youre wrong but from now on i neither
swallow or reject you until ive really ex-
amined the case and have gathered suffi-
cient evidence with which to form-and
support-an opinion of my own if people
who have really studied the case endorse
you that is evidence that must be seriously
considered but it does not in itself consti-
tute proof that you are true unless the evi-
dence can be shown conclusive in itself

  i and my mental processes are not very
important but the letters from some of
you make it necessary to state my case clear-
ly and in detail the question of caesars
character though interesting is not of
vital importance but the insight into
the american mind and character that this
case has afforded is very decidedly of vital
importance

  for see what happened letters began
coming in some of them were from men
who like mr mundy had dug into the
facts and records done independent think-
ing and arrived at conclusions of their own
most of them disagreed with him but
whether they did or not they and their
opinions are entitled to respect but
others came from men who had read much
swallowed much and thought little their
opinions are entitled to very little respect
for their opinions are not really their own
and others were from men who had read
only a little swallowed most of it and
thought none at all their opinions are

entitled to no respect whatever any more
than was my own swallowing of what little
i had read

  i had asked two or three i knew were
familiar with roman history to give camp-
fire their views knowing they were pretty
certain to take up the case against mr
mundy and thus ensure a full discussion
but it is the spontaneous letters that are
most significant as index to american
thought habits entirely aside from the
question of whether caesar was or wasnt
which they are depressing i havent
lived all these years without learning that
mankind is generally illogical or at least
unlogical and that it tends to cling blindly
to established opinion whether right or
wrong but these letters somehow brought
it home with a sickening jolt

  there was actual resentment bitter
hostile resentment that any one should
dare take a new view of julius caesar
youd think he were a national issue
these hostile ones didnt prove the new
view was wrong except by quoting other
peoples opinions it was new therefore
of course it was wrong one of them was
so shaken to his foundations that he wrote
me anonymously to say hed read and liked
the magazine for years but after this attack
on julius caesar he was through with it for-
ever yes and thats as far as he got to-
ward any proof or reasoning-the other
fellow differed from him and therefore was
not only mistaken but criminal

  these are the material from which are
builded our bigots and fanatics and our
ultra-conservatives who fight against all
progress because all progress is a going
from old things to new here we have the
intolerance that is one of our national
curses here-oh well lets look at the
letters but in parting id like to remark
that if those who completely failed to com-
prehend my attitude havent read their
historical references and authorities with
any more exactness and understanding
than they read my statements in the feb-
ruary  camp-fire their conclusions
and deductions from the former are likely
to be equally baseless and erroneous

  here is one from elmer davis formerly
of our staff for some years one of the edi-
tors of the new york times and author of
various books of fiction for a long time
the history of the romans and greeks has
held particular interest for him he has


adventure

read widely and is in the habit of digesting
what he reads i am compelled however
to question his digestion of the editors
amplifications in this case said am-
plifications were either queries only or as
stated above-an insistence on open-mind-
edness and a refusal to accept any theory
on caesar without satisfactory proof

new york city

  i think mundy is a grade a certified fiction writer
but as an historical philosopher i think he is punk
nor do i think what he said about rome and caesar
justified the editors amplifications in the february
th camp-fire mundy is in good company
of course in knocking the roman empire lots
of people disapprove of it h g wells disap-
proves of it because it wasnt socialist and i take it
mundy disapproves because it wasnt theosophist
anyhow here is the way it seems to me

tn general and for these times i am as

  hearty an anti-imperialist as anybody but the
roman empire was a long time ago and things were
different certainly the romans conquered and
looted and enslaved so did everybody in those
days the romans simply happened to be better at
it than anybody else but when they had con-
quered and enslaved when the first excitement
was over they began trying not only to govern
their subjects decently but to let them in on the
management of the roman empire and in time
they gave a better government than our half of the
world had ever seen before and to more people
in its way self-government from vespasian on
for the next four centuries till the western empire
ended the emperors and their generals and minis-
ters too came from spain from africa from the
balkans from syria from gaul and britain very
rarely from rome a career was open to talent
any man who was good could go to the top a
hundred years after caesar died probably a fourth
of the inhabitants of the empire were citizens with
full privileges or the families of citizens after cara-
calla around  ad they were all citizens

  rome tried and succeeded in the job of giving
good government as other great empires of antiq-
uity did not persia made a half-hearted attempt
with some slight success under darius and then
slumped the kingdoms that followed alexander
did better as a rule than the tribes and city states
they superseded but rome first did the job on a
big scale certainly rome was not perfect civil
wars arising chiefly from a constitutional defect
finally so weakened the empire that it went to
pieces and the high overhead cost of government
helped a good deal too that is a lesson congress
might profitably remember if it had brains enough
to remember anything but while it lasted rome
was better than anything the human race had had
before it

vkfhat does mundy prefer his gauls and
britons i think he idealizes them as eigh-
teenth-century philosophers used to idealize the
noble savage quite permissible for a fiction
writer but dont call it history certainly those
noble germanic ancestors of ours who upset rome
were nothing to be proud of they were a lot of

tough gorillas who knew how to fight and that is
all they knew they conquered and looted and
enslaved just as the romans had done five hundred
years before and that was all they did all they did
for centuries till they had intermarried with their
subjects and the blended population began to re-
cover a little of the old culture they wanted land
and slaves so that they could live high without work
on the loot of a palace they didnt have brains
enough to build or even to live in that was as
far as they got

  if mundy thinks so much of the gauls call in
the gauls as a witness against him a hundred and
twenty years after caesars time in  ad the
whole empire was upset by a series of civil wars
and the army of the rhine went to italy to support
one of th claimants to the throne thereupon
some of the commanders of native regiments
germans who had been left behind got up a rebel-
lion and a few gauls joined them they got all
worked up and proclaimed the empire of gaul
hurrah for liberty equality and fraternity free
beer and no taxes take off your coats boys or
togas rather and come out to dance in the light of
the moon thereupon there was held at rheims
a sort of national convention of all gaul a hun-
dred and twenty years after the conquest they had
had that much experience of rome many of
these men pure gauls in blood were by that time
roman senators and all of them must have been
citizens they talked it over and decided that
having tried both they preferred rome to gaul

rphese particular men of course hadnt tried
both liberty was back in the days of their
great-grandfathers but they knew their history
they knew that the roman army alone kept the
germans out of gaul and even those who wanted
to secede were entangled instantly in a whole string
of insoluble problems what should be the con-
stitution where the capital who would run
the country the romans had been doing that
and these delegates the big men of gaul had sat
in on it they decided quite sensibly that there
was nothing in secession to be sure they may
have been influenced somewhat by the fact that
the civil wars were over and a man named petilius
cerialis was coming up from rome with seven
legions to see about this empire of gaul but the
fact remains that after a fair trial the roman
conquest had beenratified if not by a plebiscite
certainly by a constituent assembly two or three
hundred years later gaul was the backbone of the
empire

  all this is in the histories of tacitus book iv
chapters - and in chapters  and  you will
find a speech of cerialis to some of the rebels which
pretty well sums up the argument for the roman
empire

jphis of course was the empire a much more
respectable affair than the republic at least
after it had turned imperialist mundy has some
color for his argument in that rome was at its worst
politically and morally and from the standpoint
of administrative efficiency in caesars day all
the big politicians were pretty tough just then they
had to be to get anywhere caesar was the best
of the lot the only one who could see ahead could
try to reform the terrible mess that the roman re-
public had become and make it work for the general
the camp-fire



good his private morals no doubt were not those
of a deacon in the church but suetonius whom
mundy seems to follow is a far less reliable authority
in such matters than the illustrated daily news

t dont know where mundy gets his stuff about
the romans relentlessly stamping out the
mysteries nor his belief that they were all inter-
connected and all theosophist i dont think youll
find much of that in the profane historians though
his esoteric writers may have played it up caesar
was rough on the druids of gaul for the same reason
that the english were rough on the irish priests in
the days of elizabeth and cromwell-because the
national religion was the cente rof national resis-
tance your opinion of that depends on whether
you are pro-irish and pro- gaul

  as to the mysteries in general a reform wave
in rome a hundred and twenty years before caesars
time tried to suppress one form of orgiastic mystery
religion but rome was young and simple then
later on there was nothing the romans ate up so
eagerly as all forms of oriental religion the more
mystery the better the mahatmas and gurus
if they had ever got so far west would have found
ancient rome as much of a gold mine as modern

new york city

   in your number of february th i find the note
in which you ask to hear from any historians in
confirmation or rebuttal of mr mundys theories
concerning roman government and practise

kj ow i happen to remember that mr louis
courajod of paris in his lessons at the louvre
emitted most distinct views concerning the action
of the romans in gaul he was for many years in
the ecole de chartes in paris that is the official
record office of france where they make it their
business to write reliable information by getting at
the original sources so much so that when courajod
was appointed lecturer at the louvre he created
a small revolution by ideas which set things topsy-
turvy in architectural criticism now in his pub-
lished lectures which can be seen at the new york
public library one finds he sternly condemns the
romans for their rascally treatment of gaul i do not
recall the details but he says in effect that by their
ruthless exactions through men who farmed the
taxes and got all they could out of the people
they ruined the gaulish noble families and when
villages were depleted of men the remaining in-
habitants had to pay the same amount as before

   as this went on for centuries the backbone of the
people was broken and when the roman power
fell to pieces they were no longer able to withstand
the northerners so the franks and burgundians
came in and took the lead this was disastrous
for everything under the franks went overside as

   

lavisse has shown in his great history so for about
nine hundred years there was a steady sagging down
till the depth of the dark ages was reached when
slowly an upward growth began this time indepen-
dent of roman militarism and due to local initiative

as the gauls and the britons were doubtless
much the same it is interesting to know
they were efficient craftsmen and artists they
had a metal working city near autun in central
france which when destroyed by the romans was
left in undisturbed ruins and was investigated in the
xlxth century this with the wonderful gaulish
camp in the cte dor not far from autun which
has been carefully searched by the government and
its many remains placed in the museum of st
germain enables us to get a pretty close idea of the
gaulish culture it certainly was far more refined
than usually supposed

  the gaulish coins of which some of each tribe
have been found show a distinct relationship with
the greek coins of macedonia there are other
points in their history which show relationship
with greece and in switzerland formerly part of
gaul known as helvetia objects of greek origin
have been found one expert traces back the origin
of the legend of the holy grail so prevalent in
medieval epoch in brittany to the cauldron or fer
the center of military life like the camp kettle
which was representative on some of these coins
and was also a greek usage

   there is nothing surprizing then in a relationship
between samothracian or pythogorean mysteries
and druid cults if greek art is derived from
egypt as professor breasted affirms there may be a
relationship also with the very ancient egyptian
ideas

  but the gauls lived in strongholds separated one
from another by stretches of forests which dangerous
wild bears and wolves infested there was little
or no political cohesion among them and it was the
work of the romans to join up the country by build-
ing a network of fine roads with military stations
skillfully planned so that armed legions could be
concentrated quickly in any part of the country
which was then permanently held in subjection to
be systematically exploited these roads were used
all through the medieval epoch and now become
automobile routes-clements heaton

one from frank r whitzel
as to my swallowing mr mun-
dys theory whole the comrade
is respectfully referred to what
ive said above on this point or to pp -
 of our february  camp-fire my
original statements

miami florida

  just a few remarks since you invite them

  theodore roosevelt is dead and an author may
now slander him without risk may call him a liar
lecherous cruel thieving murderous anything save
drunken that happens to have been disproved in
court but what would be your opinion of an au-
thor who accused roosevelt of debauching the wives
of all his closest political associates would you
swallow it whole yet that is apparently what
you have done in regard to mr talbot mundys
stories of caesar
i

adventure

tphe licentiousness of caesar is based upon stories
circulated by his political enemies that he had
violated the wives of pompey crassus gabinius
and others of his own party his closest friends
and supporters such calumnies were a common
practise in roman politics and no one paid them
much attention at the time why cicero was
accused of intimacy not only with his freedman
tiro but with his beloved daughter tullia the
men whom caesar was accused of dishonoring paid
no heed whatever to the stories pompey married
his daughter crassus guaranteed his debts and
gabinius followed him with unshaken fidelity until
his own death

  the same lies bythe same people for the same
reason were told of caesars relations with the wife
of king bogud yet that king remained to the end
caesars steadfast friend

  only one other name is mentioned in con-
nection with these stories cleopatra it is very
likely that caesar did form a liaison with cleo-
patra in alexandria but historians say she
was visiting him in rome at the time of his
murder and fled afterward there is no basis
for his yarn not the slightest on the con-
trary suetonius says plainly that cleopatra
visited rome during caesars ascendency and
that he sent her home laden with gifts the
story grew out of the fact that cicero in
his letters obscurely mentions a queen who
was in rome at the murder but he gives no
name and there is no reason save the petty
desire to slander a great man for assuming it
to have been cleopatra

sar was probably little better certainly
no worse than other romans of his epoch
but of his gross licentiousness there is no evi-
dence that a sensible man would consider for
a moment his history was written by his
political enemies members of the aristocracy
who hated caesar first because he was the
champion of the common people the demo-
crats and second because he and his family
were raised so far above themselves whom
they considered his equal or superior in birth

  is it fair for mr mundy to accept what he finds in
a classic writer that fits his own opinions and rejects
what does not that is called working your
evidence and you can prove anything if you cook
your evidence

  mr mundy is not the first to find out that
caesars commentaries were written with an eye
to their political effect yet they have stood the
test of time and searching criticism as to their
general accuracy and we have some pretty fair
evidence of their truth to mention but one point
ciceros brother quintus was one of caesars
lieutenants now both ciceros were bitter political
opponents of caesar and marcus dipped his pen in
vitriol to oppose the dictator yet never before
or after caesars death does he question the truth
of the commentaries on the contrary he speaks of
them with strong praise

  i could easily refute the other slanders that of
cruelty for instance-it would be childs play but
no doubt mr mundys mind is fixed beyond reach
of proof so i will say no more save that i for one
will skip the tros stories and i am sorry as mr
mundy has been my favorite of your writers-
frank r whitzel

a letter from james hatha-
way he may as he says be
a more or less half educated

roughneck but he thinks for
himself which is a lot more than most
wholly educated people do for themselves
some of his statements will cause some
people to moan with horror at his blunt
frankness and to froth with rage because
they dont agree with them how dare
he think contrariwise from themselves
and still more how dare he express his
opinions openly he writes from minne-
sota which is part of the land of the free
where free opinion and free speech are said
to be corner-stones of our political structure
but that wont help him much if his opinions
venture out of the usual ruts

  and may i in advance call to the at-
tention of the hastily minded the fact that
i am neither endorsing or attacking his
opinions but merely listening to them

excelsior minnesota

   am not a historian just a more or less half edu-
cated roughneck who has knocked around the world
for about forty years and who prefers to read history
etc to reading the latest snappy

jy y point is that i think mundy is full of pink
prunes while he writes a good strong readable
yam he is crazy he has dug up all the old stuff
used to frighten the people and mulled it over till
he has lost sight of bedrock facts

   the organic law of the roman republic is to my
mind the best piece of political law or rule of govern-
ment ever produced and as long as the roman people
continued to be a nation of small freeholders it was
a very effective rule of government but after rome
overcame carthage and the various greek city
states slave labor became so cheap and common
that free labor could not compete wealth came into
the hands of a few and the small freeholder was
forced out leaving the land in the hands of the rich
this has happened many time to many nations
through recorded history and will happen again

   this was the situation in julius caesars time
this forced the freemen into the army the roman
legion was no more hard boiled than any other
body of men would have been under the same con-
ditions i am an old soldier and i know

rthe oldest military command in the world is
breed before you die hence our  hours to
get married in the last war through all history the
women have been part of the spoils of war wit-
ness the records of some of the european armies in
the lastwar and the women havent minded so
much as long as they were treated half-way decent
to caesar and his men the women of gaul and ger-
many were just good looking savages to be treated
as such much as the early white men used indian
women in this country

   any body of men such as the roman legion has
to have action and plenty of it but their wants
the camp-fire



would be the same then as now in the last war a
soldier on leave from the front wanted first a drink
then a square meal then a good looking blonde and
another drink when he got back to the front he

got- so he had his fun while he could the

roman legioner took these things as his share of the
loot we bought and paid for them not much
dfoerence

  as for julius caesar i know men of his type to-
day brilliant successful business men of the small

wiry alert type dissipated as- woman-chasers

who yet give the world far more than they take

  as for rome not keeping faith what nation
does did we with all our pride in our word keep
faith with the indian we did not and to the old
roman the gaul and britain were much like our
indians to us

  caesars problem was to conquer and hold the
land from the rhine to the roman line against the
land hunger of the germanic tribes if he could
destroy a whole tribe at once his problem was just
so much easier modem people have done the
same

  to sum up rome gave the world far more than
she took-law good roads respect for authority and
the value of citizenship we got these from her
and these are worth a thousand of mundys stories
however brilliantly he may tell them

  to quote virgil

     others belike with happier grace
     from bronze or stone shall call the face
     plead doubtful causes map the skies
     and tell when planets set or rise

     but roman thou-do thou control
     the nations wide and far

     be this thy genius to impose
     the rule of peace on vanished foes

     show pity to the humble soul
     and crush the sons of pride

  the old romans were cruel and hard many
times faithless but their respect for law and authori-
ty gave them the world-james hathaway

at our next camp-fire well hear more
 opinions on c j caesar deceased

concerning his novelette in
the may th issue something
from william byron mowery at
this writing the fate of the texas
rangers is in doubt but it is to be hoped
that an organization with so splendid a
record will be carried on to further use-
fulness

austin texas

  re hard lines a couple words it is based
upon the incessant trouble experienced by both the
american troopers and the mounted with indians
jumping back and forth across the border the
character of inspector raymond may be a source of
objection inasmuch as readers do not usually asso-
ciate his like with the mounted if i had made him
a typical officer the objection would be condemn-
ing ive taken pains to imply he decidedly was
not the mounted it seems to me had and has
less wire-pulling etc than any similar organiza-

tion i know of unless it be the texas rangers
however it has had its inspector raymonds just as
the rangers have been imbroiled in political and
labor disputes not typical of their usual activity

  a minor point the treaty payments may not have
been madein american money at the time of this
story im simply unable to find out the fact of the
matter they were so made seven or eight years
later for certain the question is not very vital-

  greetings to the camp-fire circle bom in the
last decade of the nineteenth century in a small
town founded by my maternal grandfather and
named after my mother in the state of kansas

as a small boy took several long trips throughout
the middlewest with a cattle-buying uncle
and other relatives and acquired a taste for ram-
bling sent to central america on a visit at the
age of eleven and became incurably infected with
tropicalitis

  when twelve years old was sent from new york
to florida to go to a military school saw the inside
of the school once entering through a basement
window to get to the gym and swimming pool

  returned to the family home in tennessee when
the funds got low and went to school for a while but
was never happy the walls of a schoolroom al-
ways seemed to me to be entirely too constricted
had a disagreement with a teacher and was started
off to the tenn military institute went to st
louis and took in the fair with three others ho-
boed back three weeks on the trip which was
somewhat educational and then departed to central
america again

cet foot in the lands of romance and glamor
along the spanish main on xmas day 
started out on the career of a soldier of fortune
but failed wofully and became a t t t instead
got well informed about the canal by walking it
from culebra to colon toting a straw grip on the
end of a stick over my shoulder that was an-
other educational trip

  in time became a banana herder and have
followed that noble profession with morfe or less suc-
cess ever since rejected for service in the war
weighed ninety-nine lbs at physical examination
due to a combination of malaria dysentery neu-
ralgia and a few other kinds of algias and
itises but got a small excitement out of it by par-
ticipating in a private war on germans and pro-
germans down this way

  went home after seventeen years of rambling and
gathering experience sporting a mustache a coat of
tan a few lines in my face and a sour expression and
taking with me a small boy to present to my folks as
the fruits of my years returned south after six
weeks of snappy weather and thats about all

ljave hung around in the flickering shadows of
the camp-fire glow for a long time listening
to the talk and a-honin to edge up and sit in the
circle but never quite able to overcome my bash-
fulness until just now not overly afflicted with
modesty-just bashful

  well im sure pleased to meet you-all apologize
for making you listen to my braying for so long and
will now sit down and give some one a chance to say
something interesting hasla otra ocasidn-
erle d hosmer

many of you are familiar in one
form or another with the sagas
upon which arthur gilchrist
brodeur has built his complete
novelette in this issue the following
survey from him will be found interesting

berkeley california

  i drew my material from the volsunga saga of
which the story forms the first part this first part
is much older than the rest of the saga it probably
goes back to the th century it is one of the
earliest and most genuinely scandinavian of all
legends that have come down to us in working
out the story i discarded the supernatural element
which is strong in the original inserted a few minor
characters such as ulfgeir and valrun toned down
the more savage aspects of the legend and furnished
some of the machinery in which the sagas are as a
rule deficient but i have in no sense altered what
seems to me to be the essential spirit of the original
the story is truly representative of the point of view
and the manner of life of the northern peoples at
the time i have however made valrun instead of
signy the mother of sinfiotli

  precise dates and places are hard to establish for
any really old legend for the sagas and poems in
wliich the legends are incorporated are much later
than the historic events reflected in the legends
thus the date for the events of this story cant be
given with any greater precision than some time
between  and  a d probably in the third
century

at that time the northern peoples had not so
completely coalesced into settled kingdoms as
they did later denmark norway and sweden
were still divided into petty kingdoms acknowledg-
ing no common overlord as for frakkland there
are two theories as to its identity the older and
still more generally held is that it is the territory
occupied by the franks on the lower rhine that
theory doesnt fit in with the details of the legend of
sigmund at all though it does square perfectly with
the later parts of the volsungasaga which deal with
the exploits of sigurd the german sigfried reputed
to be the third son of sigmund the fact is that the
legend of sigmund is purely norse and its setting
must be norse too while the german legend of
sigfried which must be localized in frankish ger-
many was tacked on to the sigmund legend later
probably in the th century to give it greater
popularity the latest and soundest theory as to
frakkland is that proposed by the swedish scholar
ture hederstrom he places it in weden in the
province of ostergotland his proof rests on a host
of details the most important being his discovery
that there is still a district known as frakksta in

ostergotland and that frakksta district has sev-
eral farms or villages originally royal manors which
bear the name of volsung valsing valsinge fru-
valsinge etc this evidence has been accepted as
conclusive even by many of the adherents of the
older theory

tt is plain from the legend that sigmunds land
must be one that would naturally come into
rivalry and political contact with gotland got-
land is an island off the southeast coast of sweden
it was the original home of the goths ostergot-
land is one of the eastern coast provinces of sweden
within an easy sail east by south of gotland add
to this the discovery that a district of ostergotland
is called frakksta and that this district still pre-
serves the name of volsung and you have a good
case to clinch the matter a kings burial mound
containing richly adorned weapons has been found
in one of these places bearing the name of valsinge
thus the whole action of my story takes place in
what is now the southeastern part of sweden

   the belief that frakkland was franconia in ger-
many doubtless owes its existence to the fact that
norwegian and icelandic writers of the  th and
th centuries thought frakkland meant land of
the franks and to the erroneous attachment of
the legend of sigfried to that of sigmund-an at-
tachment made even in scandinavia

cigmunds home was thus one of the many
little kingdoms existing in scandinavia at the
time of the great teutonic migrations gotland
was the most important and richest of these petty
kingdoms owing to -its advantageous position
being an island it was protected by a stormy sea
and at the same time got the trade from germany
gaul denmark esthonia and russia through
russia by the overland trail to greece it got the
cream of the mediterranean trade with the north
the north swapping furs and amber with greece and
rome in exchange for jewels gold and finely worked
utensils frakldand would naturally have trade
and sometimes war with gotland it is inconceivable
that franks in germany should have worked so far
back to the northeast as to get into political rela-
tions with gotland frankish traders would cer-
tainly touch there but there is no record of hostile
contact or of political relations between frank and
goth except as franks fought with goths for spain
and southern france at a date very much later than
that of the story-arthur g brodeur

in connection with his story
in this issue alex mclaren writes
that the grindstone incident is
history silver reef nevada was
the camp i do not publish his letter be-
cause in stating the case to me it necessarily
told too much of the storys plot in advar e

here is a letter printed with-
out its writers name for very
good reasons he is an army
man and it isnt healthy for an
army man to express an honest opinion or
cite facts on army matters even if his mo-
tive is of the best for example general

mm
the camp-fire



mitchell and his frank statements about the
weakness of the air service that will be
asked to shoulder a vital part of the defense
if this country is attacked

  i do not know all the facts about the
air service but i do know of one test that
proved the efficiency of planes against bat-
tleships-and of how the army bureaucrats
hushed up the results looks on the face
of things as if general mitchell had sacri-
ficed himself for his country as really as if
hed given his fife on the firing-line and
as if thare might be some bureaucrats in
the army and war department who are not
serving this country but their own interests

  the following letter came in response to
a speculation of mine at camp-fire as to
just how many reds the bolshevics had
worked into the army the bolshevist
plan for getting a country is to seize it by
force and surprize the army of that coun-
try is perhaps the most important factor
to be dealt with when a coup is pulled off
the best way to keep that army from mess-
ing up the coup is to work their own men
into its ranks gradually until in the emer-
gency it will become an ally instead of an
enemy

  have they begun doing this to our army
how far along are they in their plan to
what extent is the army already bolshevist
in enlisted personnel these queries were
first raised in my mind by an army officer
closely in touch with the facts now here
is a letter from another army man read
it and consider whether this is a serious
matter

  i should advise any one who has any mistaken
ideas about the foreign element in the u s army to
visit any one of the garrisons around new york
forts wood jay hamilton wadsworth totten
slocum or any other post on the atlantic coast for
that matter let him make a note of the foreign
faces hell see and hell find them nine out of ten

  mind you i dont say all these are reds or would
not fight for the nation if occasion demanded but to
me there is something wrong when those same nine
men would rather talk among themselves in some
ungodly foreign chatter than the language of the
country they have supposedly adopted

  farther west the army becomes americanized
but even in the southwest it contains a liberal
sprinkling of-mexicans the united states is the
melting pot of the world they say so is its army

  several questions arise

  i	just who is responsible for the ad-
mission of such a hugely disproportionate
number of foreign-born who still seem more
foreign than american

  	do those responsible allow this from
mere lack of common sense or

  	are those responsible for it them-
selves in sympathy with or paid by the
bolshevics

  	is anything going to be done about

it

  it is worth knowing about who can add
any data as to u s army personnel vs
bolshevism 

its always with a shudder that
i pass a gun letter on to camp-
fire not that guns arent an
interesting subject quite the
contrary and thats what makes me shud-
der for from experience i know a gun letter
will bring in a deluge of more gun letters

fort worth texas

  i just read mr raymond bergins letter on colt
 automatic pistol and there is no doubt but what
he knows this gun he takes two paragraphs ex-
plaining the causes of jams and then winds up by
saying that nine out of ten jams are caused by care-
lessness which admits that said gun might fail ten
times but suppose we only count the one time not
caused by carelessness and that should happen to be
the time you needed the gun and where are you
then

  answer is you are dead-that is unless the other
fellow has an automatic that jams at the same time

  a gun is like a chain just as good as its weakest
link if a gun has any weakness at all it is not

worth a-except to bluff with and bluffing may

be all right at some games but gun bluffing is dan-
gerous in some parts of the country

  now take the colts single action  it never
jams or fails to function just so long as you feed it
good ammunition drive nails with it throw it
in the water or sand bust heads with the barrel
then start firing and she will shoot perfectly all
you have to do is to load cock and fire either one
shot or  its all the same to betsie she is
made for business and never balks

  i own and have handled both kinds but would
not have an automatic on me in a gun country
how are you going to keep an automatic clean in a
desert country-ira a thompson

haiti

     listen to a couple of old-timers
recalling the days when they chased
the wily caco

  request-having been an interested reader of
adventure for the last ten years and having spent
endured or what you will three years in haiti as a
member of the marine corps i thought it would be
pleasant to write to you to exchange our views on the
place

  i know nothing of the mineral resources of haiti
i was not in the exact position to learn about that
i did a little fishing-never catching anything-shot
a few stray chickens pigs and natives

  all the fruit i saw grew wild i learned to like
the spanish apples zabokas figs quinin oranges and
the w k mango as you probably know most of
that stuff grows wild the gooks only cultivating
a small garden wherein they raised a few beans
spuds and stalles of com

  during - the h p davis company of
new york cultivated quite a few acres of castor-
beans to get the oil for the lubrication of liberty
motors

  as to coffee it grows wild all over the hills i

have seen as you have heap after heap sacks after
sack of it on the water front in port au prince and
cape haitien i knew one merchant in the cape a
m de catalogne who had extensive holdings

  haiti fascinated me ive heard the throbbing of
the drums for five days and nights out in the bush
i have heard the weird call of the conch-homs from
the top of some moon-drenched hill i have seen
the dull-red glow of the watch-fires of the cocos i
have heard the gusty-voiced washwomen calling
to each other and singing as they beat the dirt out
of clothes resting on a rock in the artibonite

  while stationed in the cape i climbed the rough
road to the citadel of henri christophe saw its
caverns galleries and courtyards heard the drip
of water the whir of wings the crawling of hard-
bodied creatures over its flagstones

  i have stood on the spot where to impress a
visitor with the rigid discipline enforced king
christophe marched a company of soldiers to their
death two thousand feet below i have seen the
wondrous view from those mighty towers rivers
towns and dim in the distance the cape quartier
morin and historic petit anse

  i hiked from the cape to gonaives passing
through limhe gangcock where we enjoyed im-
mensely a swim in an icy river plaisance where we
ask adventure



found the largest grapefruit ive ever seen and
where we could see the frowning barrier of pills-
bury ennery very hot very stony entirely sur-
rounded by hills and so into gonaives a town of
wide well-lighted streets and an immaculate civil
prison-and a movie where i saw the burning of
rome for the fiftieth time more or less as the sub-
titles were in spanish an interpreter was used to
read them off in french which proceeding caused the
three piece orchestra  to rest at least forty times

t spent three days there and then left for port au

  prince via the u s s potomac i explored the
capitol thoroughly in the two months i was there
previous to leaving for mirehalais in the interior
from the city gate on thenorth to bizoton from the
docks to the mountain house i rode the fire-
spitting trolley i drank kola in the cafe st louis i
endured the odors of the market houses to see what
was there i spent several hours in the huge cathe-
dral a truly beautiful place when the last rays of the
sun enter through the stained windows

  and ive entered the one-horse power taxis at the
caserne dessalines gave no directions and was
promptly driven to the chinese restaurant enter-
ing at the restaurant giving no directions i have as
promptly been driven back to the caserne fare-
what have you

  about the patois i learned it rather well-i
had to i have tried to learn french at the same
time and failed i have always noticed that authors
or writers who write of haiti never use any creole
words in their narratives why is it creole can be
written

  i studied french under a very learned black man
c jean-jacques in his tiny home on the corner of
th and j in cape haitien the evenings i spent
there were enjoyable ones although not so profitable

  in the interior i could stand on the highest moun-
tain and see not a trail i had not hiked over from
hinche to saut deau from bout nfigre to las
cahohas

   ive sat all night in the inky blackness of a tropical
night staring down a trail chills on a rampage on my
back for fear some tafia-crazed caco would slip and
couper ma tile

  ive shivered through the gray dawn on a hill top
wrapped in a blanket soaked the night before whenl
fought my way through the artibonites flood out
on a hike after cocos i have yet to find the quarry
awaiting at the end of those long tiring tramps

  i did not drink the rum or wines nor did i have
any affaires damour with any of the dusky beauties

  now after all this junk i hope you will write and
tell me some of your experiences in the black re-
public i will await a reply with great anticipation
-leonard e thompson los angeles calif

  reply by mr emerson-glad to have your in-
teresting letter the mineral resources of haiti are
tremendous and as soon as the french colored
gentlemen are all safely buried just so soon will i
go after the said mineral interests but in the mean
time central america is very much more interesting
to me

  the american chamber of commerce of haiti is
trying its best to get a move on the country in min-
ing and timber etc but by sitting in an armchair at
port-au-prince i do not think it can be done very
soon

  the natives out in the country do not wish any

one to dip into their hills in search of anything and
as you know some of them are not bluffers

  enclosed is a monograph on haiti which i had
printed so as to answer the general questions that
come in this you will like to read and file away for
future reference

  am acquainted with the fruits you mention some
of them would sell in new york for large sums if
the fruit could be made safe and the customers fully
appreciate the time and trouble of getting such to
new york chicago etc

  thirty-two years ago some new york men wanted
me to take charge of putting a twenty-four-inch
gage railway from the north shore in a straight line
as possible to santo domingo city on the south
coast but after some investigation they found out
conditions and quit

  did you meet any of the haitian border police
with their six-foot macanas which they use as an
inducement on the heads of the natives when it is
necessary which same is quite often

  i have found a place in honduras where it isnt
necessary to use so many s which cost money
and time in the distribution which takes one away
from the surveying instrument

  you know what i mean for you mention having
heard the drums etc

  creole although it can be written isnt of enough
interest to the readers to pay for going into the
translation thus the publishers save on the linotype
expense and the dear public never know the differ-
ence

  you speak of not catching the native you went
after your officer ought to have known that the na-
tive telegraph is always just seven jumps ahead of
the soldier sent out to catch any one in that country

  you were wise to quit before you began on the
subject of the native women for many of them are
volcanoes as some of my men found to their
sorrow and death a white mans place is with
white people all the time it sometimes pays big
dividends to be good

  i may be in los angeles in a few days and may
drop in and see you

  central american forests

an industry which awaits de-
velopment

  request-will you kindly send me any informa-
tion you may have regarding tropical forestry par-
ticularly central america -c j dyer jackson
heights l i

  reply by mr barbour-it is rather difficult to
answer your letter on tropical forestry especially
central america because you do not ask specific
questions one could write a volume on the general
subject without adequately covering it

  if you are especially interested i would suggest
that you secure a copy of the timbers of tropical
america just printed by the yale university press
it is the first authoritative book on the subject

  in general there are three zones of forest growth
in central america one is in the cordillera the


adventure

tierra fria where the growth is pine fir etc merg-
ing at lower altitudes into oaks and other temperate
zone trees

  on each side of this central zone comes an inter-
mediate zone the tierra templada in which the oaks
etc are found and are gradually replaced by sub-
tropical trees-mahogany spanish cedar cocobolo
west side only balsam of peru west side only
logwood and fustic principally east side and many
others

  these intermediate zones blend into the true
tropical growth near the sea coasts the tierra cali-
enle where mahogany chicle logwood spanish
cedar mangrove and a host of other species are
found the jungles in this zone are tangled with
lianas dense underbrush etc in certain sections
many palms are found

  lumbering is confined principally to the regions
near the sea the centers of the mahogany in-
dustry are at belize british honduras puerto
cortez honduras and bluefields nicaragua a
great part of the mahogany and spanish cedar come
to the united states either in the log or squared
logwood and fustic dyewoods come in short logs

  no scientific forestry is practiced in any part of
the region so far and the forests are not in good
condition

big game in montana

if you hanker after elk deer or bear
heres your chance

  request-i have hunted at various times in
jackson hole and on the head of the yellowstone
in wyoming but have never hunted in montana
am considering a trip during the coming hunting
season in that state and would appreciate it if you
will give me your opinion on the advantages of a
hunt on the west gallatin river near the park as
against the yellowstone near garainer if the
former what is the best point at which to leave the
train

  what are the chances for elk deer and bear and
what special time if any should i plan to arrive
after the opening of the hunting season can you
give me the name of a reliable guide for that section
and a line or two regarding the kind of outfit which
he has are there any ranches near the park which
are prepared to take in people for the summer and
through the hunting season so-called dude
ranches

  any information which you can give me along the
above lines will be greatly appreciated

  if this is published please omit my name and
initials---

  reply by mr e shaw-the game situation in the
two localities you mention varies widely the west
gallatin is the more popular hunting country as elk
are more plentiful there than in the country lying
east from garainer the hunting areas in both
sections lie wholly within the national forests
the gallatin forest covers the west gallatin area
and the absareka forest of which i was formerly
the supervisor and includes the elk country east
from garainer i shall try and explain the situa-
tion so that you may understand it and act in ac-
cordance with your own judgement

  the best of the hunting is found either at the
opening of the season or at the close of it on slough
creek and hellroaring creek near the north boun-

dary of the yellowstone park and not farther from
it than two or three miles

  hellroaring creek is about twenty-one miles east
of garainer and slough creek is about twenty miles
east of hellroaring between these two is buffalo
fork where elk are sometimes found but it is fair
deer country black-tail of course

  the great trouble of this section for elk hunting is
that the country within the absareka forest all
slopes in a southerly direction toward the park
all water runs down into the park naturally in
the late fall including the hunting season the natu-
ral tendency is for the elk to drift lower down and
therefore into the park where as you know they are
permanently protected

  toward the close of the hunting season in decem-
ber th old bulls often work back into the higher
country within the forest along hellroaring and
coyote creeks at such time the snow is often
quite deep and more or less of a handicap particu-
larly in getting out with your outfit

  the best guide that i know of in that country is
clarence ryerson of garainer he has a good out-
fit of horses and an excellent camp outfit he is an
old-timer at the game and has handled parties
through all of the country surrounding the park and
down into the hole he would be equally available
for the west gallatin trip

  the topographic situation on the gallatin is en-
tirely different there the higher summer elk range
lies within the park and the natural drift in the fall
is down the country and out of the park however
all of the country between the yellowstone river
and the west gallatin river for a distance of ap-
proximately six miles north of and away from the
park is reserved from hunting and is the gallatin
game preserve

  naturally the elk are well acquainted with the
preserve boundaries and hang up in there after
coming from the park every year elk are killed
in the country outside but near the preserve early
in the season but it is usually late after the heavy
snows that the most elk are taken

  however the hunting season closes on the galla-
tin side on november  whereas it remains open
in the country east from garainer until mid decem-
ber there have been years when the elk drifted
out of the park in great numbers and were slaugh-
tered within sight of the town of garainer but i
judge that such hunting would not appeal to you

  there are several dude ranches in that country
karsts ranch on the west gallatin handles quite a
few people in individual tent-camps about fifteen
miles as i now recall it below the elk country and
the wilson ranch somewhat similar is located at
the boundary of the game preserve about five miles
from the park line

  on the garainer side of the mountains james w
parker has a ranch well back on the slope above
garainer and about five miles from it from which
the mamouth hot springs terraces can be plainly
seen he is just starting in at the game below
garainer about nine miles on cedar creek j n
dick randall has a most attractive and one might
say luxurious log ranch-house built expressly for
handling summer guests house is of twenty-two
rooms equipped with electric lights and bathrooms
and billiard tables his rates include saddle ponies
for use at all times without extra charge his post-
office is corwin montana the address of the
west gallatin ranches is salesville montana
ask adventure

  you mentioned bear hunting of course you
probably know that the fall is not the best time to
hunt bruin either randal or ryerson are quite
successful along all lines of big game hunting per-
haps randall knows the grizzly game better than
most at least in the hellroaring country but it
would be hard to discount ryerson at that it de-
pends somewhat on how the spring opens up as to
the best time to start after grizzly they den up
higher in the mountains and come out later than do
the blacks and browns unless conditions have
greatly changed within the last year you can reason-
ably expect to kill a grizzly in the hellroaring coun-
try and probably a black bear on a two weeks trip
in the spring suggest that you correspond with
clarence ryerson as to the best time for either a
spring or fall trip

  you will have no difficulty in finding my place
about twelve miles south of middleboro and i shall
be glad to see you at any time whenever you care to
rim down in a personal talk i can give you a more
detailed line on that country heres wishing you
the best of hunting

 the scourge of the pacific

influenza most dreaded of dis-
eases in tahiti

  request-what is the present total population
of tahiti and also how many whites and natives

  what was the date of the influenza epidemic in
tahiti and how many in tahiti died of it

  what are the requirements if any for gaining
admittance to tahiti

  would also like to have some general information
on the following topics clothing living conditions
commerce

  if these answers are printed would like to ask that
my name not be mentioned---

  reply by mr c brown jr-the present total
population of tahiti is about  about three
per cent of this population is white while from
seven to ten per cent are chinese the rest of the
population are natives of the polynesian race

  the influenza epidemic occurred in the latter part
of  carrying away fully  tahitians hec-
tor macquarrie who was in tahiti at this period
describes the whole thing in his tahiti days
and if you have access to numbers of adventure as
far back as  you will find in a september issue
one of my south sea tales the fourth boy
which has to do in part with the terrible plague
that swept tahiti and the adjacent islands since
that time the survivors have never really been the
same people when the epidemic is mentioned an
indescribable sadness comes over them

  an american passport viseed by a french consul
and a certificate of vaccination are required of all
tahiti visitors too there is a tax of fifty francs
which is paid immediately upon arrival

  the very best of room and board can be ob-
tained in papeete for  a month

houseboating on the mississippi

four thousand miles to go un-
less you get tangled up with the
ferry cables

  request-a friend and myself are going to spend
a few months on and about the mississippi in a

power houseboat and want some dope concerning
this method of travel

  we have about two thousand dollars but natu-
rally wish to get by as cheaply as possible consistent
with a reasonable amount of comfort we are
going to start from some point in minnesota or
iowa and have a rather vague idea of using tlie
ford motor as a power plant in the boat would this
be practical

  what would be a rough estimate of the cost of a
good safe boat x

  is the white river navigable for a light draft
boat as far as eureka springs ark if not how far

  is there any pearling at the present time along the
white river

  i have been told there were very few fish caught
in the mississippi is this true how is fishing in
the smaller streams such as the st francis white
and arkansas rivers

  what is the attitude of the inhabitants along the
river toward shantyboaters the general character
of the latter we are strictly out for an interesting
trip and want to miss as few such places as possible
so if you can suggest any side trips that are worth
while do so by all means we have lots of time and
may stop occasionaly and work if anything shows
up-e p moore los angeles calif

  reply by mr spears-i dont think you would
need a xl-foot boat id suggest x with
-inch hull instead the smaller boat handles
better costs a lot less and you dont need power
floating down stream an eighteen-foot skiff with
an outboard or small motor would handle the
shantyboat if you worked up eddies sweeps-
oars-are a lot cheaper and cut cost of boat a lot if
you build yourself or hire built especially

  if i were you id start on upper missouri at ft
benton or below in a twenty-foot by seven-foot or
even six-foot with oars and a fourteen-foot-long
cabin build hull of lh-inch clear lumber well
caulked and framed - inches deep and cabin
floor on the bottom stringers plenty big enough
an outboard motor would handle all way down
could run up tributaries starting in may-look
out for cables or ferries over the river-youd have a
great trip at little cost probably work on farms
along the bottoms in dakotas nebraska iowa etc
and earn cost of trip

  arrive in lower mississippi in october-november
get maps of missouri and mississippi from missouri
river commission kansas city mo and missis-
sippi river commission st louis mo missouri-
mississippi would give you  miles down it
would hold you a while

  cost of -foot shantyboat probably  to
 outfit-ropes oil stove and cots blankets
etc whatever you are mind to buy

  plenty of fishing for table all way down-youll
have to learn how

  cabin boat primer published by a r hard-
ing columbus o would give you all info you need

  dont bother with a power plant in shantyboat
get an outboard for it

  white river st francis river all fished out for
shells could work up them with outboard if you
could get up shallow shoals

  carry a - carbine a shotgun a  rifle for
rabbits etc but some hunting forbidden

  lower mississippi not very hospitable for shanty-
boaters but youd have a fine country-wild-


adventure

down the missouri a long way lower river trap-
ping forbidden through a lot of the country

  fishing commercial is matter of local control
might strike good down missouri ask along

  lots of fish in mississippi-have to know how to
get em

  if you dont want an answer enough to
enclose full return postage to carry
it you dont want it

     motoring across the continent

     heres some travel dope from one
of our new a a men mr fred w
egleston has taken the place of mr ches-
ter davis as expert for montana and the
northern rocky mountains we were darn
sorry to lose mr davis but he had to leave
the territory and he himself suggested his
successor

  request-a chum and i are going to make a trip
through the west this summer i have had some
experience touring and camping i built up an old
ford to make several trips in the east the terri-
tory we wish to invade is new to me so i am hoping
to hear from you in regard to the following questions

  	what work can be secured along the way

  	can you furnish me with an idea of auto laws
i will encounter

  	what equipment would you suggest

  	is a fishing license needed in the states you
cover

  the above questions refer only to section you
cover as i have writen to men covering other sec-
tions we will appreciate any additional informa-
tion you care to give us-clark b johnston
ingram pa

  reply by mr egelston-taking up your ques-
tions in numerical order

  	you should be able to pick up considerable
work along the way although there is nothing doing
right at this time would suggest that you could
pick up quite a little money adjusting cars for other
tourists if you are planning your trip during the
tourist season owing to present conditions it is
impossible to give you a more definite answer and
would advise that you write later in regard to this
matter

  	the auto laws need not worry you as long as
your car is equipped with proper lights and brakes
the legislature now in session is working on a new
set of laws so can not advise you as to definite
provisions

  	this depends upon whether you expect to
camp or not if so a light tent a couple of heavy
blankets each woolen underwear flannel shirts light
woolen socks and riding breeches and boots or
puttees are advisable as to cooking utensils there
is an infinite variety available personally my
equipment would be a tarp or sleeping-bag heavy
double blanket army mess kit cup and a cofiee pot
and water bucket it would be advisable however
to carry a tent unless you could lie up in a town
during rain storms you are not likely to encounter
the latter in this state in summer

  	you must have fishing license in this state

  you can get a tent which will cover your car and

leave room for sleeping as well this is a good plan
there are a lot of extras which may be had at the
tourist supply houses and your own ideas and
pocketbook should guide you in their selection
personally would not load myself up with a lot of
unnecessary junk

  an aluminum set of pails which nest and take up
very little room is a handy thing to have you can
get a portable gasoline stove which converts the
gasoline into gas before burning this would be
very nice in the eastern country where summer
storms are frequent but you need a camp-fire here
on summer nights a portable grill about two or
three feet long to place over camp-fire is as good a
stove as you need for cooking this resembles a
huge toaster with two legs at each end these fold
when not in use and are to be pushed a short way
into the ground for cooking

  it would be well to carry extra brake bands for
your car and dont forget your chains

  hoping that the above will meet your require-
ments

     salmon-fishing off vancouver

     right-royal sport

  request-i am expecting to do a considerable
amount of fishing during the coming year around the
port of vancouver that is in first narrows and
english bay i have a good strong rowboat and
would like to try for salmon and any other fish that
may be had in this district kindly advise what
class of tackle is best for salmon trolling weight of
sinker and general depth of line what other fish is
to be found in this district and what depth

  you would also greatly oblige me by giving the
name of a good reliable fishing tackle co so that
i may write for their catalog

   in the past i have fished in the prairie river and
do not know much of coast fishing-edw g
poole vancouver b c

  reply by mr j b thompson-the salmon of
the coast waters do not respond well to an ordinary
fly but they do to most spinners which are used with
stiff-action fly rods or they respond to the short-
bait casting rod with a stiff action when trolled as
at present practised

  not many years ago while i was there i used a
double-propeller-shaped spinner called the tandem
spinereno and one of the popular bass feather
minnows to this i added a -ounce sinker and
had some royal sport this without the sinker on
a fly rod brought good results in streams with
salmon and also with steelheads and all the large
trout of the coast

  also while i was there many had great success
with the ordinary wooden plug used in casting for
bass the groove-headed one with red head atd
white body seemed by far to do the most business
they trolled with them and many cast them with
very heavy salmon rods

  as i continually receive catalogs from american
firms i am sending one in which you will find listed
the articles i mention

  heres wishing you a successful fishing seaso

the santa maria

inside dope about columbus
flaghip

  request-what was the gross or net tonnage of
columbus flagship can you give me a rough
description of the interior plan the length and beam
the draft and a description of the steering gear

  what was an astrolabe

  i dont want to impose on your good nature too
much but would also like similar information re-
garding a viking galley i am interested in both
cases in the layout of cabin crew space and galleys

  if this letter is printed please do not use my
name-and many thanks to you for any data you
may send--

  reply by mr b brown-the santa maria the
largest of the three ships of columbus had a length
of keel of  feet between perpendiculars 
feet over all  feet breadth  feet she had
a displacement laden of  tons and the weight
of hull was  tons the extensive forecastle over-

hung the stem nearly  feet there was an enor-
mous structure aft with half and quarter deck above
the main deck there were three masts and a bow-
sprit each carrying square sails except the mizzen
which was lateen rigged

  an astrolabe was of many different forms the
essential feature being a graduated circle it was
the precursor of the quadrant and later the sextant
in the century encyclopedia dictionary there is a
picture of the astrolabe used by drake

  there was a viking ship unearthed in denmark
about seventy-five years ago probably a representa-
tive vessel of the class her sheer and her lines were
like those of a clipper ship beautifully designed
she was clinker built with the planking secured to
the beams by cords or withes from the roots of
trees she was calked with hair or moss beams
rested on top of the frames and carried the deck
planking she was steered by a long oar fixed in
place on the starboard side had two masts with
square sail hoisted on the yard from the deck she
was pierced for oars below the deck line there is
no information available to me about the layout
of cabin crew space and galleys
