the famous composite madonna

in this photograph there are blend-
ed the portraits of twelve of the
greatest living pianists as follows
paderewski de pachman joseffy
rosenthal hofman hamberg
gabrilowitsch lhevinne bauer
dalbert slivinski sauer

the study of this idealistic face is not only interesting to students of physiognomy in exhibiting
the predominance of the purely artistic and temperamental features and the subordination of
the grosser ones but it offers to lovers of piano music a field for speculation in an effort to imagine
a repertoire performance by a composite unity possessing all the varied and distinctive charac-
teristics associated with each of theartists merged in this composite portrait

important

no magazine illustration could convey all of the refined
subtleties of expression and the mystic qualities of the
composite negative so a limited number of proof impres-
sions were struck from a copper photogravure and printed
on imperial japanese parchment size x  suitable
for framing and a copy will be sent to early applicants on
receipt of four two-cent stamps to pay packing and forwarding charges the edition is lim-
ited each copy numbered and bears no advertising

the

kranich  bach is truly a composite of the highest artistic units it possesses
the essentials that contribute to tone quality artistic appearance durability and economy
and not only combines in its own unity the individual elements of all qualifications of piano excel-
lence but in addition it possesses important exclusive features not found in any other piano of the
world this piano has earned the title supreme in the class of highest grade

dober l park draped his long legs
 over the foot of the steamer-chair and
blew rings of cynical smoke at mount
lebanon his veins were full of quinine
and his trunk was full of cuneiform tab-
lets whose exportation was strictly for-
bidden by the padishah it had been a
great honor for a young professor of
twenty-eight to be appointed director of

 the universities exposition to mesopo-
 tamia but digging among the palaces of
 forgotten kings is not conducive to sound
 health any more than it is to the devel-
 opment of the social graces for a year
 and a half park fought off the malaria 
 then just as the arab diggers had uncov-
 ered a tempting bit of the city wall chol
 era broke out in the camp and it became
 necessary to postpone further excavations
 until the autumn the natives scattered




the red book magazine

 to their mud-walled villages excepting a
 lew who were buried by the river side
 and the american director with sore dis-
 appointment in his soul set sail lor lon
 don where he expected to put in the
 summer months reading in the british
 m useuni

   by the time the steamer reached bei-
rut however parks disappointment had
settled down into a comfortable pessim-
ism coupled with a physical lethargy
which no external discomfort could dis-
turb after all islam is largely a matter
of climate the squat funnel of the con-
go sent out a cloud of fine soot which
sifted slowly dow n through the awning
strange noises and various riental odors
wafted now and then from the mass of
luggage and pilgrims on the fourth-class
deck the air over the bay waved back
and forth with sizzling heat and twisted
the clock-tower of the american college
into fantastic curves a thin blue haze
dropped from the mountain and the sy
rian sun wrapped everything in the deli-
cious enervating warmth that makes you
dream of wonderful plans for future en-
ergy and ambitious achievement-while
your feet are perched on the steamer-rail
and you spend three smokeless hours
rather than go down to the stateroom for
another match park let his tauchnitz
novel drop on the deck and lazily pitied
all the world especially everybody who
was forced into physical exertion or hur-
ried decision

   down under the first-class gangway
there was the usual mob of syrian boat
men shouting cursing gesticulating
and fighting as each one tried to get into
the best position before the steamer re-
ceived pratique and the passengers
began to go on shore around the gang-
wav-ladder the crush was so great that
some of the smaller boats were almost
forced out of the water  but now and
then a newcomer of higher rank or su
perior strength would dash wildly
through the pack tripping up his less
agile brethren with their own oars amid
renewed profanity in the curseful arabic
old omar the rug dealer was there
with a load of gorgeous carpets which he
would give away-at bandit prices
two boats held a delegation of turkish

officers ingold lace and dirty linen who
had come out to welcome their new com-
mandant then there was the usual army
of guides dragomans shopkeepers
 ook s red-shirted porters and immacu-
late interpreters and agents from the
hotel ctorient and hotel dangleterre

  after the quarantine-flag had been
pulled down and the shrieking horde of
rowers had fought their way along the
narrow steps and swarmed up to the deck
by every hanging rope and open port-
hole park noticed that one boat which
had been on the outskirts of the pack
was making no apparent effort to get its
passengers on board the steamer in the
stern seated in the midst of a confusion
of rugs and portmanteaus was a very fat
very bewildered-looking but very de-
termined- ooking old lady who seemed
to be objecting to what was being said
by the two boatmen a younger lady was
seated in the bow w ith her back turned
toward the steamer so that all that park
could make out was a white haffiveh such
as is affected by english travelers which
fell from her straw hat over a pair of
square little shoulders that never were
grown outside the british isles

  park sauntered over to the rail and
viewed the boat-load with the keen but
unemotional interest that he would have
given to a contract tablet or a new speci-
men of quartz the quarrel seemed to
grow more intense it was evidently the
old question as to whether the boatmen
could extort three times the fare that had
been agreed upon the stout lady ended
a brief remark with an emphatic snap of
her aristocratic jaw one boatman swung
his arms with a threatening gesture then
raised them to heaven with tragic en-
treaty while the other syrian picked up
an oar and prepared to back away from
the steamer the girl in the white kaffiveh
alternately pleaded with the boatmen and
with her obdurate companion suddenly
she put her handkerchief to her eyes

  nobody was more surprised than rob-
ert park by what happened next not
even the two terrified natives who sud-
denly beheld a gigantic bearded frank
step quickly from boat to boat until he
vaulted upon their own pile of luggage
tt had taken the young american just
a postponed proposal



one sixtieth of a minute to throw away
lus cigaret and h is cynicism and discover
in himself a capacity for physical exer-
tion and a delight in the merely sensuous
such as had never before manifested it-
self in his philosophical temperament
from his vantage-ground  the lug-
gage park glowered down like an aveng-
ing jinni- and supplemented his short
sharp commands with a wealth of arabic
anathemas which comprehended all the
boatmens ancestors and descendents to
remote generations it was fortunate the
ladies could not understand all that was
said for parks recent experience as
overseer of three score lazy fellah in had
given him a more effective vocabulary
than that printed in the front of baed-
dekers red-covered guide to palestine
and syria

  after the luggage had all been safely
stowed away in the stateroom and the
now thoroughly cowed boatmen had been
dismissed without the customary bak-
slutsh the elder of the travelers thanked
their champion with a condescending
graciousness the girl with the white
kaffiveh said nothing at all  but just as
park turned to go up on deck again she
held out her hand to him and looked her
thanks from blue eyes that were still a
little moist from fright

osophical scholastic malarial park fell
in love unreasonably and incurably just
because a pair of blue eyes looked out at
him from under a white kaffiveh

  the worst of it was that he could nev-
er be made to see the foolishness of it
all but gloried in his fall especially in
the suddenness of it last summer when
i explained to him that it was a clear case
of propinquity he called me names in
heathen tongues i could not understand
then i tried to convince him that for a
man who had spent nearly two years
away from civilization it was the most
natural thing in the world to fall in love

with the first english-speaking girl he
met only to be told that  was an uu-
licked cub who did not know how men
felt which was a manifest calumny
against one who had been the varsity
stroke

  if one were to believe park this par-
ticular maiden would have dazzled the
houris of paradise her form was as
royal as the desert palm-tree and her step
like that of the lithe syrian gazelle her
eyes were a clear unfathomable blue like
the water of the aegean and her hair was
like the ruddy gold of the sunset-glow
on lebanon her skin was as white as
the snow of hermon and her blush like
the shadow of an evening-cloud her
whisper was like the soft rippling of the
nile her laugh was like the singing of
the bulbul and the magic of her hand-
clasp was like-like-the rubbing of
aladdins lamp

  and all this potpourri of mixed sim-
ilies was served up by the man who dis
covered the tell abyud inscription and
wrote the masterly excursus upon the use
of the infinitive construction in the ear-
lier semitic dialects

  by the application of a little literary
criticism to dr parks poetry i have
come to the conclusion that the divinity
was a typical english girl of about twen-
ty square-shouldered straight-backed
with light hair blue eyes and a good
complexion  height about five feet four
weight one hundred twelve pounds

  but if robert park ever sees this he
will never forgive me

  after several years acquaintance with
park i am quite sure that when the girl
appeared at dinner that evening without
her mother who had succumbed to the
heat of the afternoon and the excitement
of the recent conflict i feel quite sure i
say that her ris-a-ris did not turn a
hand-spring or give the vale yell prob-
ably he bowed with resigned politeness
as if he had just been interrupted in im-
portant reflections upon the theological
bearings of the hammurabi code and
looked over his glasses with dove-like


the red book magazine

meekness hut inwardly he was a raven-
ing lion watching fur his prey an ir-
repressible simian swinging gayly from
the tupmost branches of the palm-tree
a yelping exuberant ranine pup chasing
himself round and round in frantic glee

  mabel-for so park had heard her
called by her mother-acknowledged his
greeting with a brief word of thanks for
the successful outcome of the afternoons
adventure but refused to be drawn into
further conversation and answered all
questions with almost monosyllabic brev-
ity

  no her mother was not feeling well
-ves it might be a touch of abu rikab
- it was not at all serious-her mother
was always a bad sailor-yes they were
going all the way to marseilles-no she
would not have any more sugar

  but old park looked so very solemn
and safe that even maidenly shyness
could not refuse him the after-dinner
promenade up and down the short first-
class deck and that walk was the first
of many if a great atlantic liner in
spite of its thousand passengers and all
the comforts and distractions of a city
 an each week of its life give opportunity
for countless tctc-a-tetes and salt-water
engagements what can measure the am-
orous influences of a tiny mediterranean
steamer with no drawing-room except
the narrow dining-saloon and with cab-
ins so hot and stuffy that one must needs
spend all day and most of the night out
on the upper deck  when the month is
july and the moon is full and only three
passengers can speak english and es
pecially when one of these three- is prov-
identially confined to her stateroom-no
wonder that the soul of robert park
danced like the little hills as he looked
forward to the next ten days

  somewhere or other he had once read
that the way to make a person to like you
was to become a good listener and allow
the other to do all the talking and he
was anxious terribly anxious to be liked
by this particular young person so he
planned to draw her out he would gain
her confidence would get her to talk
about herself her school-girl life her
ideals her impressions of the east these
last he was sure would be all wrong but

somehow mabel refused to be drawn out
either the well was too deep or some-
thing was the matter w ith parks conver-
sational pump possibly she did nut relish
being treated like a school-girl by tins
lean bearded giant

  yet after the first awkwardness of
new acquaintanceship had worn off they
talked incessantly talked at dejeuner
second dejeuner dinner and evening tea 
talked up and down the deck after every
meal  talked from their steamer-chairs
as they idled away the long hot after-
noons talked as they leaned over the
rail to gaze down at the moonlit path
that led across the dark blue waters but
it was always park who bore the burden
of the conversation

  he was surprised to find himself so
loquacious he told her of things he had
not even thought about for many years
his early pranks at the university the hard
poverty of that first year after his fath-
ers death the days of study and nights
of tutoring that nearly broke down his
health before the coveted fellowship was
won he described for her the old home
in new england and the tent-life in the
east he related funny stories about the
native diggers and his fellow explorers
all of whom she came to call by their
nicknames she was so interested in ev-
erything and showed such an apprecia-
tion of what he told her that each night
park resolved never to talk about himself
or his work again and each morning he
waxed more enthusiastic and more confi-
dential

  but as to his plan to win her confi-
dence one night after dinner just as
they had completed their fourth turn
around the capstan he suddenly realized
that he did not even know her name
mammas timely illness had left them
the only two english-speaking people on
the congo and park seldom had occa-
sion to single out his companion in the
vocative case when he did address her
it was simply as youand when he
apostrophized her in his dreams it was in
language that ought never to be pre-
served except in full morocco editions of
the lays of the ancient troubadors

  why miss-miss- he stammered 
but she made no attempt to help him
                    park glowered down like an avenging jinnee
                    
the red book magazine



  why i dont even know your name
he exclaimed with wonder here we
have known each other all this time-it
had been three entire days-and i dont
know whether you are miss smith or
miss brown or the princess of wales 
heard your mother call you mabel  he
added but  suppose you would hardly
let me do that

  no she replied with disappointing
acquiescence but professor dont you
think its a bit uncomplimentary to have
shown so little interest in the person
whom you rescued from the barbarians
and she laughed teasingly at the discom-
fited park

  besides she continued it is hardly
safe for a gentleman of your wide fame
to spend so much time with a person of
whom he knows so little why i might
he an utterly impossible body-a ladys-
maid or an escaped convict or-

  park made an ineffectual effort to dis-
sent but she laughed on

  dr park you dont deserve to know
who i am and i believe  wont tell you
at all at least she continued relent-
ing not until we reach london

  we will pretend that i am a princess
in disguise-

  i believe you are ejaculated park

  silence in the court and you must
promise not to ask mamma about it or
you shant ever see us after we get to
england promise now

  and the subdued park gave his word

   after all it really made very little dif-
ference whether he knew her name or
not there never was any doubt as to
whom he was addressing  for she could
not talk to anybody else on the steamer
and he would not and there was one way
in which he could mildly counter her
every now and then he would seem to
forget himself and call her mabel
following it always with a prompt apol-
ogy and the explanation that as this was
the only name he knew her by it was
hard not to let it slip out once in a while

itt

  according to the schedule printed in
the appendix to cooks continental
railway guide the congo touched at

rhodes smyrna constantinople pirsfi-
us and naples and park must have been
a valuable cicerone at each of these
cities but he has no recollection what-
ever of having visited any part icular port
of the mediterranean during that mem-
orable voyage it is true however that
he has a faint memory it was on shore
that certain notable phases of her char-
acter first won his admiration  and he
retains a very vivid picture of a golden
head that he followed through mazes of
nameless streets by unrecognized ba-
zaars and into many mysterious mosaic
mosques

  all too soon the voyage was over the
congo lay off the quarantine station of
marseilles waiting for the final report
of the health-inspectors of the port
park held in his hand a yellow card stat-
ing that he was not suffering from chol-
era or pest but he was smitten with a
more incurable sickness though not one
that necessitates detention at quarantine
the girl beside him was exclaiming at
the stern gray walls of the chateau
dlf but poor park was held prisoner
by stronger chains than ever bound ed-
mond dantes and he knew of a treasure
richer than that of the abbe and perhaps
as inaccessible

  a sou for your thoughts professor
laughed the fresh young voice he had
come to love so well are you glad to
get back to civilization again if we are
to catch the paris express mamma and i
must be getting our luggage together

  as if to support her statement there
was a furious clanging of the anchor-
chain as the steamer began to move
slowly toward the inner harbor but
parks hour had come and he spoke out
with unskilled bluntness

  mabel will you marry me

  again the recalcitrant anchor was
noisily lifted a few inches

  will you mabel  dont know what
your other name is and i dont care i f
youre a cook im not worthy of you
and if youre a princess-you are my
princess my queen-i am worthy of you
because t love-

  with a final deafening crash the an-
chor-chains lifted their burden into
place  and before the clamor had ceased
a postponed proposal



mamma came sweeping down the
deck sailing before the wind with wide-
blown skirts and flying hair all the fever
had been driven from her smiling cheeks
by the first eight of the harbor and she
was so happy so cordial so all-inclusive
in the radiance born of her newly-found
appetite that robert park ought to have
been very much ashamed of the arabic
expression that slipped out of the corner
of his mouth

  yes the luggage was all ready the
steamer was swinging alongside the dock
the paris train would leave in three-
quarters of an hour and mabel must
come down at once for her wraps

  will you take a four-wheeler to the
station asked park quite unnecessar-
ily and then with peculiar insistence
will you will you tell me now

  but mabel only closed her fingers in
a syrian gesture which park had taught
her

  wait she signaled and hurried off
below with her mother

  then there was all the usual bustle
and hubbub of landing park rushed the
trunks through the custom-house with a
facility attained through much experi-
ence in mediterranean ports promised
the driver a double pourboire if he got
them to the station in time sent two
porters ahead with the ladies and the
portmanteaus while he stopped at the
news-stands to buy some english maga-
zines for mamma ran down the long
platform just as the guard called cen
voiture messieurs   swung lightly into
the last coach of the train and hardly
mopped his forehead before the express
was off for paris

  he rested for a moment to recover his
breath and then picked up the pile of
magazines and his one suit-case and
walked through the corridors of the long
train-to find no trace of mabel or
mamma or luggage tfcere were two
evening-expresses for paris and in bis
haste he had boarded the wrong train 

rv

  it was three years later that during
my senior vacation i ran across profes-
sor park in london meanwhile we at

 the university had all heard how his
 arab diggers had unearthed the wonder-
 ful palace of some pre-historic monarch
 which contained several thousand cunei-
 form tablets in a hitherto unknown dia-
 lect of assyrian during his last winter
 by the euphrates dr park discovered
 the famous tell abyud inscription and
 gathered the materials for his great work
 on the sumarian invasion of elam 
 which won so many flattering notices
 from continental scholars he also went
 through a long siege of typhoid which
 left him with a few gray hairs to lend a
 more scholarly appearance to his youth
 ful brown head

   he seemed to me to be even taller and
 leaner and more taciturn than when he
 m tutored us in ancient history back in my
 freshman year but his thinness was nut
 of the weakling kind and his face was
 burned to a deep rich brown that made
 him look as if possibly he might be a
 young subaltern home on furlough from
 india at times he was almost distin-
 guished looking the old fellow didnt
 sayr much when i met him but he was
 evidently very glad to see a familiar face
 again though i was only an undergradu-
 ate of the institution of which he was
 fast coming to be the most distinguished
 professor i had little difficulty in per-
 suading him to knock off study for a
 while and join me in my contemplated
 trip to scotland

   we tramped slowly through the lake
 district first however and t was nearly
 a month later that we left glasgow for
 the scott country and then the high-
 lands the weather was apparently try-
 ing to show us how nasty a caledonian
 drizzle can be when it really puts its
 mind to the business but it would never
 do to stay indoors every time it rains in
 scotland so we got into our oldest
 clothes and started off with the resolve to
 let the glamor of the wizard of the
 north dispel the influence of such trifles
 as fogs and sliowers and wet coats

   and we were well rewarded for long
 before we reached ballock the morning-
 sun was shining with as much noncha-
 lance as if that were his ordinary state
 while over scotland and on those days
 when the sun does shine bright on loch
 

the red book magazine

   lomond it is a sight for gods and men
-and lovers the little steamer zig-
zagged up the long blue lake bobbing

into unexpected coves and winding
among green islets that glowed in the
warm sunshine but uj ahead the storm
clouds still shadowed the summit of ben
iomond with a grim majesty that was
verj different from anything we had seen
among the pretty hills that rise over the
park-like lake country of england

   even my stoical traveling companion
warmed up to an appreciation of the ro-
mantic scenery and as for myself if
there had been any eligible female within
gunshot i would have lost my heart to
her on the spot but unfortunately there
was only one young lady among the
small company of tourists on the boat
and she was monopolized by an egregious
englishman who hung around her and
over her in a fashion that got on my
nerves though heaven knows it was
none of my business

   he was a good looking chap not very
big but with broad shoulders and red
cheeks and lie was remarkably well
groomed in fact the beauty of his per-
son and the art of his haberdasher al-
most overwhelmed him especially when
he glanced now and then at the two sun-
burned travelers in muddy tweeds who
leaned upon the rail beside him i heard
him called lord charles somebody-or-
other and forthwith  hated the whole
british aristocracy but lord charles
was quite undisturbed by my scorn he
beamed upon the loch and paid graceful
compliments to ben lomond if it had
been the matterhorn he would have
doubtless leaned down condescendingly
to pat it on the head i endured him
fairly patiently however until lie at-
tempted to patronize the girl-she was
such a nice girl too then i could have
slain him

   i began to feel really sentimental
about the girl and tried to interest park
in speculations concerning the apparent-
ly uncongenial couple but he growled
back that he had not come to scotland to
stare at young women and conceited
boys and that if i would look at the scen-
ery of loch lomond instead of losing
my head over every pretty face i met it

would be more beneficial to my morals
and more agreeable to my friends which
was a fairly long speech tor park to
make upon any subject not intimately
connected with his specialty

   after the steamer reached inversnaid
we lounged around the pier for a few
minutes waiting for the carriages to
start  then we suddenly decided not to
drive just yet but to walk up the first
steep slope and catch the coach at the top
of the pass this we knew could be done
quite easily for the horses always take
this hill at a slow walk with frequent
stops for rest

   as we climbed briskly up the winding
path with ever broadening views of
great britains largest and most beauti-
lul lake the romance of scotch scenery
and scotch poetry was too much for me
and i incontinently broke forth into
song

by yon bonnie hanks and by yon bonni
      braes

where the sun shines bright on loch
      i oniond-

    could not help thinking how sad ii
would be if somebody or other-say that
pretty girl from the steamer-should fall
in love with poor me and then die or le
forced to marry a gouty old duke while
 remained all my life long in broken-
hearted faithfulness

but me and my true love well never meet
      again

rv the bonnie bonnie banks of loch
      lomond

  the old jacobite love-song has a
sweet pathetic lilt which makes it come
back again and again to ones lips and
heart when we stopped for a last look
at the beautiful panorama i hummed the
refrain again

bui me and my true love well never meet
      again

by the bonnie bonnie-

   please oo thats not true we shall
meet again 

  could it be old park who spoke so
vehemently the poor fellows eyes
glistened a little as he looked over the
lake to the mountains beyond but his
jaw was as hard as thai of a bronze
statue
mabel will you marry me i dont know what your other name is




the red book magazine

  then suddenly his reserve broke-
down and he told me the whole story
of which i had never had a suspicion
even during these weeks of close compan-
ionship he told of his hard winters of
vflork in the hast of the two weeks par-
adise on the congo the sudden loss of
his sweetheart and the fruitless searches
every summer since it seemed that those
frequent journeys from mesopotamia to
england were not merely in order to
consult ancient manuscripts in the great
libraries but so that he might wander
about disconsolately visiting boulevards
and parks theaters and churches palaces
and museums and shops hoping against
hope that somewhere he would see his
princess again and yet all this timetie
had hugged his disappointment to him-
sel f

   if he had confided in some friend who
knew less about nineveh and more about
london the quest might not have been
so fruitless but who would have guessed
his secret what student of the univer-
sity would credit the statement that old
park was in love with anything except
his tobacco and his arabic what fellow
instructor would not be amazed to learn
that underneath the solemn exterior of
professor park there burned a fire like
the furnace of nebuchadnezzar and a
purpose that would carry its owner calm-
ly through high way-robbery or piracy

  since then i have been able to see a
good many humorous points in the story
and have had many a jest at parks ex-
pense  but as the reserved scholarly man
opened his heart to me amid the romance
that broods over loch lomond it was a
very solemn thing indeed i could not
think of anything appropriate to say
however so when he had finished i gave
him my hand in the embarrassed silence
that is apt to come after grown men have
been exchanging school-girl confidences
and  at least was heartily relieved to
hear our coach come rumbling up the
hillside

v

  as we swung up onto the back seat of
the open vehicle t noticed that my fng
lish girl and her escort were on the seat

in front of us and parks recent confi-
dence were forgot leri in my glee at the
discovery that lord charles was being
punished for something or other by his
fair companion he had lost all of his
complaisant loquaciousness and spoke
only at rare intervals and then in com-
plaining tones to which she paid no at-
tention whatever

  we were the only four passengers on
the coach lord charles sat in front of
me and the girl was directly before
park so that her broad straw hat must
have  ut off a good portion of his view-
over to the road ahead from where 
sat however there was a most enchant-
ing prospect and by leaning a little for-
ward-to see the mountains-i could get
her features in delicious profile against
the dark trees that line the highway
these features were smaller than ben
vorlich but they should have been
double-starred in baedeker the girl
must have been well into the twenties
but her face had all the charm of a very
pretty child albeit a very angry one the
long lashes dropped scornfully over the
flushed cheeks the straight little nose
was held the least bit higher than when
 had seen it on the boat and the little
mouth was pressed tightly shut with a
determination that almost made me over-
look the tiny quiver of the lower lip

  but when  did notice that trembling
lip scott and burns and bishop percys
r cliques and the battle of bunker hill
got all mixed up inside of my cranium
so that i had to put my hands in my
trousers-pockets to keep them away from
the unsuspecting collar of lord charles
well-fitting coat

  my dear professor park-the rattle
of the wheels made our conversation
quite private--my dear professor
park i repeated we have not come to
scotland to stare at young women  and
if you would look at the scenery of the
irosachs instead of losing your head
over every pretty face you meet it would
be more beneficial to your morals and
more agreeable to your friends

  it was a rather heartless remark fol-
lowing so soon upon what he had told
me on the walk up but the boastfully
incurious park was assiduously craning
a postponed proposal



his neck in a fruitless endeavor to see
around the big straw hat in front while
his face wore a more trance-like expres-
sion than mine could ever have shown
under like circumstances

  besides i continued this is my
own discovery hands off

  hut deaf to my remonstrances robert
 ark began slowly and stealthily to work
his long fingers into the pocket of the
girls rain-coat

  my first impulse was to catch hold of
his arm and pull the hand back my
second thought was to explain to lord
charles that my companion was a harm-
less lunatic traveling with his guardian
what  really did was to sink back in
the seat and watch the proceedings with
breathless interest for i realized that
when a man of parks age and previous
sobriety begins to make a fool of him-
self it is useless to try to stop him if
robert park had really made up his
mind to break into a scotch jail all the
kings horses and all the kings men
could not keep him out

  so heedless of my personal liberty or
reputation i sat in guilty silence while
professor robert park phd lhd

frgs etc etc insinuated his felon-
ous fingers into my english girls pocket
and softly and gently drew them out
again firmly clasped upon her little
purse

  i gasped then i said rumpelstiltz-
kin -possibly it was a shorter word-
and waited for developments

  dr park next tapped his fellow pas-
senger on the shoulder and politely in-
quired

  pardon me madam but is not this
your purse which seemed a rather su-
perfluous question under the circum-
stances

  she had to turn half around to answer
him and the new view of her face com-
pleted my subjugation

  yes- she started to say then
stopped in the middle of the word with
half-opened mouth and looked at my
friend with eyes that seemed very fright-
ened

  she might well have been frightened
for the irrepressible park suddenly
dropped the purse to the bottom of the

coach and seized both the strangers
hands with a grip that made her wince

  will you say that again he asked
quickly tell me now-at once-ive
waited too long-which is it

  it is-yes

  she spoke very low  but this time she
finished the word and i saw it was not
fear that made her eyes glisten

  the dialogue could hardly have con-
sumed ten seconds but before it was
finished lord charles as well as myself
had passed through at least ten different
emotions each one more violent than
that which immediately preceded it
when the stolen property was restored
he fumbled crossly in his pocket for a
sixpence we did look rather disreputable
after our long tramp up the muddy hill
when park took her hand lord charles
naturally felt called upon to interfere
in his place i should of course have
done the same but crazy or not park
was my friend and i leaned over the
front seat so as to interpose a fairly
bulky shoulder between him and the irate
briton the latter drew back for a blow
when for a moment both he and i were
petrified with amazement to see the girl
take parks long hand in both of hers
and look up at him with a gaze that
 would have given my ears to receive

  then her escort burst he began by
damning my innocent self-which fact
i recalled to his notice later in the day

  mabel he commanded let go of
that miserable rascal so that  can thrash
the life out of him 

  but mabel was smiling up at the mis-
erable rascal as if there had been nobody
else between john o groats and gretna
green

  you impertinent brute sputtered
lord charles as he tried to climb past
my shoulder let go of her hand this in-
stant  do you know that it is lady
mabel greymore whom you are insult-
ing

  park smiled benignly

  no my dear sir i did not have the
slightest idea what her name is mabel
informs me however that you have been
annoying her all the morning and that
as soon as you leave the coach she is
going to kiss me


the red book magazine

  and by the by he continued as the
apoplectic young man finally got past
my shoulder if you care to send her
your apologies please address them to
mrs robert park care of brown ship-
ley and co london

   did not push lord charles off the
coach i am willing u take my oath that
i did not  is true that when he struck
out blindly at old park all sputtering
and cursing and tripped over my foot i
did not make any effort to prevent a
catastrophe but  showed a considerable
amount of charity by immediately jump-
ing out after the fallen champion

  between the coach and the ground 

gave up all interest in my loch lomond
heroine and when  found that the ob-
durate englishman absolutely refused to
listen tft any explanations or apologies 
forgave all my enemies throughout the
world

  when peace again reigned over the
mountains of scotland i loosened my
hold upon lord charles well-fitting col-
lar removed a hundred and eighty-
pounds of varsity crew from his deli-
cately tinted waistcoat and gazed
thoughtfully along the road to where a
distant coach was merrily bowling down
toward loch katrine with one solitary
passenger silhouetted against the brown
hillside-or were there two

the exact psychological moment out came
sampson and poured in the secret pro-
cess and jimmy stirred and scraped
and turned his product over and over
and over again

be mighty careful with this batch
lads said sampson the superintendent
one morning the boss is bidding for
the big tobacco-contract do your best
the men laughed

  year in and year out the old man had
tried to sell his stuff to the universal
tobacco company the biggest tobacco-
company in the world abercrombie 




the red book magazine

son were selling licorice to everybody
save to the tobacco-combine abercrom-
bie  son was the biggest independent
licorice concern in the world hut the
licorice-trust which couldnt manufac-
ture licorice like the abercrombie output
if it tried a hundred years had clung
tightly to the big tobacco-people there
were private interests that few knew
alumt stockholders in the one trust were
stockholders in the other

  still the agent of the tobacco-peo-
ple had once w hispered to old abercrom-
lie keep it up good goods in time
have gut to count your timell come j
 

  and j g abercrombie did something
more than mix his little formula he
spent all his spare time trying how to fig-
ure the right way to swing the tobacco-
combines demand for licorice

  ill do it some day lie told himself

  but old abercrombie was not the only
man whose brain was busy with a prob-
lem too big for him jimmy turnbull
was trying to think out things too

  heres me out here jimmy would
say to himself stirring and scraping
and theres him the old man in there
doing nothing but knowin the secret
process its a great game-a winning
game for him a losing game for me its
a game ive got to beat somehow

  jimmy turnbull was living in an age
when the whole world took off its hat to
the men who made money the world did
not inquire too closely how the money
was made so long as the man made
good that was enough to jimmy turn-
bull in his moral adolescence prosperity
at any price seemed good

  that there secret process he kept
saying to himself if i could get some
chemist-

  and then for the first time an idea
struck him

  by george he told himself what
if i should be that there chemist gee
me here on the inside and him an samp-
son never knowin its a long game but
by george knowin a secret process is
the real thing its that for mine i
guess

  jimmy turnbulls ideas of right and
wrong may have been warped but he

  possessed a wondrous virtue he had
what few men have-patience he could
wait lie could work

  ill be a chemist he said to himself

  it took time to find out even how to
start in he read the morning-papers anti
the evening-papers finally he struck it

  them there evening-high-schools
he assured himself finally ought to do
the trick theres these techneck night
schools that teaches these here speciali-
ties thats all i want i want to be a
chemist i know most everything now-
reading writing arithmetic grammar
and all about the jogafy an history therv
ever was  but i dont know no chemistry
if  know that and if i can get a good
strangle-holt of a secret process-gee
ill be a abercrombie one of these days

  jirnmy didnt tell the night-school peo-
ple he wanted to lay a foundation where-
by he might accomplish a successful
theft of the property of his employer he
simply started in and studied as he went
on he sniffed with excitement this was
good this chemistry you got test-tubes
and acids and alkalies and mixed them
up and-did things he liked it there
was one reason why he liked it-but he
didnt know that reason jimmy turnbull
was a born-chemist the words the se-
cret process seething through his brain
awakened something in him that had
lain dormant-this was in his line

  he worked hard and as he worked
he began to realize he was learning some-
thing beyond his specialty jimmy i urn-
bull was broadening he found suddenly
that he had never known reading writ-
ing grammar until now knowledge was
beginning to make of him a full man
even his inoral nature-but no behind
it all lay the desire to discover that secret
process to take his ease as abercrombie
did

  ive got to know that process he
cried within himself its the one thing
that lies ready to my hand its my road to
wealth besides the old man has had it
long enough its about time the aber-
crombies loosened their grip ill loosen
it for them all right

  he worked indefatigably he liked the
work work like this he was doing night
to jimmy turnbull prosperity at any price seemed good

after night couldnt seem hard and the
night he took a stick of manufactured
licorice and started in to analyze it was
the happiest night of his life so far he
finished at three oclock a m and he
shook his head

  theyll never get the secret process
from the manufactured product he said
to himself never

  his time would come he hoped and
he was glad one day when he heard the
mutterings of the men at the factory a
wave of dissatisfaction had passed across
the country and had broken over the men
at the abercrombie factory

  maybe in the trouble therell be a
chance jimmy turnbull whispered t
himself


oo

the red book magazine

   hut he held aloof and watched fie
sided neither with the boss nor with the
men to jimmy turnbull a strike was a
foolish thing but he never said what he
thought he let other men do the talking
and the crisis came sooner than he had
expected three men stalked one day inti
the private office of the old man

   its the delegation whispered the
 men at the kettles and they held their
 breaths uutil the delegation came out

   they crowded about the delegates the
 delegates shook their heads

   hell put on new hands boys they
 said	

   there was a responsive growl

   he turns you down went on the
delegates

   it was only the beginning half an
hour later every man left his kettle and
walked out jimmy turnbull went with
them he didnt know why he did but it
seemed to be the fashionable thing to do
just then and he did it at closing time
the only employee who stayed was samp-
son the superintendent

   now maybe thought jimmy turn-
bull his moral sense still blunted may-
be ill get that secret process

   he didnt know how he would get it
 but trouble always spells opportunity for
 someone and he reasoned that he might
 lie that one

   abercrombie  son put on new men
three nights later jimmy turnbull
found himself in the midst of a knot of
the old hands in front of the factory
jimmy as usual said nothing he had
attended this meeting because he had
been requested to do so he started slight-
ly as one man at his right began to talk

    its the secret process were after
 boys said dunn a fellow striker thats
 all and nothing else

   the secret process echoed jimmy
 for it had never occurred to him that any-
 body but himself ever thought of it at all

   ah said dunn thatll bring him
to terms-such terms my boys hut not
a cent of cash mind now not one cent
you hear

   an hour later the thing that was to
 happen happened the crowd broke si-
 lently and with dispatch into a rear
 door in the factory broke somewhat

 noisily through two more doors in the
 interior and then stood with bated
 breath outside the laboratory-door

   inside is the office safe whispered
dunn and inside the safe-

   jimmy turnbull sniffed the secret
process he must be the first man to get
it if they broke open the safe that was
his chance hut he kept on the outskirts
of the crowd nevertheless he was pas-
sive

   now all together said dunn

   there was a mighty heave a crash
and the door gave way

   then there was a scream dunn had
been hit upon the head by a man who
stood inside the office-a man with an
iron bar in his hand

   the next one will get shot ex-
claimed this man inside

   it was sampson the superintendent

   take warning cried sampson again
 mean business this is a pretty game
highway robbers-thieves

  were not after money growled
dunn we want that secret process

   thats property returned sampson
youre robbers just the same

   jimmy turnbull started it had never
occurred to him in just that light he
wouldnt have lifted his hand to break
the safe but it hadnt occurred to him
that his coworkers were so far wrong

   come on boys yelled dunn

   there was a forward surge-a flash of
light-a sound like thunder then si-
lence

   anybody shot cried dunn in the
darkness that seemed deeper than ever
all right then come on ive got him
boys

  something in jimmy turnbull had
awakened he had been passive now he
became active he fought his way through
the crowd in the dense darkness they let
him through he reached the two men-
sampson and dunn-who struggled in a
corner  ith a blow of his clenched hand
he hurled dunn away

   gee theres two of em cried dunn
amazed ly

   but he returned to the charge and so
did the crowd then jimmy turnbull
managed to whisper in the ear of samp-
son
the secret process



  its jimmy sampson he said im
game ill help you through

  for fifteen minutes the battle raged
no man could see the others face jim-
my again and again hurled himself upon
the crowd sampson and he stood shoul-
der to shoulder

  come on finally exclaimed samp-
son

  they had reached the open door
sampson nearly done for darted
through it there was a lull the crowd
rested it didnt know what had hap-
pened it thought probably sampson had
been put out of business

  at any rate dunn had found the safe
-a small one in a corner dunn was a
man who knew safes he had made them
in his better days

  keep still you fools he cried and
keep that sampson quiet too

  he little knew that sampson wounded
bleeding was speeding into town for
help the crowd became quiet jimmy
turnbull still of the crowd was quiet
too and dunn in the darkness his ear
to the combination turned the knob this
way and that listening carefully for the
sound of falling tumblers

  suddenly he lit a match the crowd
surged forward the safe was open
dunn had succeeded the safe wras open
but-

  thunderation boys cried dunn
shes empty-empty and no mistake
empty-save for an old yellow piece
of paper the secret process w ell may-
be-maybe not dunn took it out and
read it

  it was short this is what it said

    some day someone will look here for
  a secret thats never been on paper-a
  secri-t lhats to he found only in one
  mans head

  that was all it was dated fifteen
years before it was signed by aber-
crombie

  stung cried dunn

  they were doubly stung-the second
time by the police inside of three min-
utes they had been surrounded-all of
them jimmy turnbull included-by the
blue coats in less than an hour they
were safely locked in cells including
jimmy turnbull

  this is a nice mess thought jimmy
to himself

  his only actual crime had been that
he had been found in company with the
strikers

  its breaking and entering for the
whole gang he heard an officer say
and maybe something worse

  it was two oclock in the morning
however when an officer came silently
and unlocked his cell

  step out whispered the officer and
dont make no noise the other chaps
mustnt get on to it at all

  j immy emerged into the glare of the
big back room there was abercrombie
and his daughter kitty a girl of nine-
teen he had brought her along because
he didnt want to leave her even with the
servants up in his big house  the hill
he slapped jimmy turnbull  the back

  jimmy he said youre the only
square man of the lot you did one thing
for sampson he wont forget you saved
his life as it is hes laid up-in the hos-
pital-down and out but ill tell you
why im here in person  want you to
take his place to-morrow-sampsons
at the factory i cant trust the green-
horns and beside theres the secret jim-
my i cant trust anybody but you

  jimmy flushed sheepishly lie rubbed
his hand across his face when he with-
drew it he found it covered with blood

  i must be a sight miss kitty he
said

  then he told his employer all about
his connection with the riot of that night
he told the truth-all save his lust and
longing for that secret process but old
abercrombie knew just one thing-that
in the event jimmy turnbull had saved
sampsons life that jimmy was true
blue that was enough

  jimmy temporarily became superin-
tendent he wore a belt with two re-
volvers in it but there was little to fear
the strikers were serving sentences in
jail-light ones for which they had to
thank sampson and their old man-ab-
ercrombie

  for one of these days abercrombie
had smiled theyll be back here again
sorry as can be theyll never do it
twice thats sure

ihe secret process



  so jimmy temporarily was superin-
tendent - j immy chemist-adventurer 
jimmy the man who was patiently work-
ing night after night to accomplish one
object

   ive got to be about it too lie told
himself for sampson be coming
back

  and one night in his little bedroom
with shades all drawn he stood and
watched and trembled

  its fresh he whispered to himself
its bound to work to-night

  it did work it was dawn when he
stretched his hands out toward the rising
sun and whispered gleefully to himself-
for by this time he had learned how to
talk-eureka eureka i have it

  the secret process was no longer a se-
cret it was his he bowed low

  to my friends the night-schools he
exclaimed my many thanks

   he was a thief

  he didnt know it didnt care j immy
turnbull had become a chemist he had
broadened he had educated himself but
his moral nature was as yet unawakened
he had instincts that were good it was
a proper instinct that had caused him to
help sampson out that strenuous night
and save his life but after all that was
merely a mans love of fairness  the ten-
dency to help the under-dog

  he knew the secret process that was
the point the rest was easy

  i can force the old man into a part-
nership he told himself i can-

  there was no limit to his future suc-
cess

  but-he didnt force the old man into
a partnership he took his time and
while he was taking his time something
unexpected happened

  abercrombie died

  and after abercrombie died sampson
drew jimmy turnbull to one side one
day

  i-i want to tell you something jim-
my he said hoarsely you know about
the secret process dont you every ab-
er rombie has handed it down from gen-
eration to generation theyve kept it in
the family

  jimmy smiled it wasnt kept in the
family now he told himself

  go on he said to sampson

  well went on sampson there isnt
any secret process any more the old
man tried to tell his daughter-you know
the girl-the night he died he never
told her he left  formula the aber-
crombie process is wiped out thats all
and i wanted you to know it

  jimmy iurnbull went back to his
room there was something that shouted
aloud with triumph within him he was
the owner of the secret  he was the sole
owner of the secret he was the aber-
crombie of the future

  he sat down after supper that evening
-it was weeks after the funeral-anti
thought about it he liked to think about
it he had striven hard to attain this
end now that he had attained it-now
that he had it at last-

  at eight oclock he rose and donned a
light overcoat and climbed the hill he
was obeying some impulse-some new
impulse some controlling instinct was
guiding his feet

  he pushed the button at the entrance
of the big house on the hill a moment
later he was in the presence of the girl-
the daughter of abercrombie late of the
licorice-business

  he pulled from his pocket a piece of
paper

  miss abercrombie he said to her
this is the abercrombie formula i stole
it from your father i give it back to you
its yours

  two months later sampson the su-
perintendent rushed up to miss kitty
abercrombie in the big house on the hill

  miss abercrombie he said between
gasps weve got that contract your
father tried so hard to get weve swung
the big tobacco-people

  no she gasped in return for she
had known her fathers efforts in his life
time no

  sure replied sampson but miss
kitty  - i hope you wont feel offended
when i say it we didnt catch em with
the abercrombie formula at all we got
em with an improvement of it you see
miss kitty this here abercrombie form-
ula had been in the family for years-
unchanged that was the trouble it
needed improvement weve fixed it up
the red book magazine

to beat the band and the tobacco-people

well miss they simply had to have

it dont you see and they had to get it
from us too for the new and improved
process is like the other its a secret

process still

sampson she answered holding out
her hand you always were a clever man

but he shook his head the new pro
cess he answered aim the sampson
process miss its the jimmy turnbull

process-and its goin to make you
rich he grinned but say he ven
lured its one that ought to be kept in
the family good and hard

  jimmy turnbull chemist and all
around man is the old man at aber-
crombie to-day lies the whole show
almost so sampson says and a her
crombies daughter-sites mrs jimmy
turnbull now they were married a week
ago to-day

marquise-a fra id-of-a-mouse

    by laurence clarke
    llustkated by frederick u forrest schook



vyarn beams from a hearth of white
 and gold transformed the chamber
in the rue mongeau into an apartment
of a palace of dreams evening was fall-
ing and squares of chill gray light indi-
cated the panes in the broad window
overlooking the street the candles were
not yet lit but the slender gilt legs of
the furniture gleamed in the firelight
and the magenta silken coverings took on
soft graduated colors from the misty
rose-pink of day-dawn to the purple
shadows of night the floreated crystal
chandelier a ghostly shape amid the
half-darkness overhead gave off tiny
shards of rainbow-hued light

  in a tapestry covered chair before the
hearth sat the marquise her feet on a lit-
tle gilt-clawed stool

  she was leaning forward reading a
brief note in the light of the fire her
gown of pale green and cream stripes
was the very height of the mode and at
her throat foamed a graceful cascade of
lace and ribbon her feet were cased in
golden slippers and scarlet stockings and
on her white fingers sparkled many jew-
eled rings she refolded her note with a
sigh and glanced for a moment at the
dreary mist beyond the unshuttered win-

dows the ruddy light of the fire glowed
on her cheeks and the cool whiteness of
her neck yielding to its spell grew oft
ly roseate the marquise was very beau-
tiful and slender and tall very proud
and high-minded very tender and wom-
anly within reach of her hand on the
corner of a green-topped card-table lay
a bouquet of six white and six red roses
tied with a broad ribbon a little drawer
beneath the table-top lay open dis-
playing a twinkling medley of gold and
silver trinkets-a snuff-box with a deli-
cate-hued portrait on the lid three quiz-
zing-glasses a strangely carved ivory
head for a walking-cane a paste shoe-
buckle smelling vials and a score of
further trivial bijouterie the marquise
looked dreamily at the trinkets then
folding the note dropped it among them
and closed the drawer

  a door-latch clicked and her husband
the marquis de la ferronay des cars en-
tered and paused in the shadows

  the marquise did not turn but took
up her flowers from the table and pressed
the cool petals to her cheeks la fer-
ronay listened for a moment to a far-off
sound as of wind in the sere leaves of a
forest then advanced into the firelight
his face pale and anxious

  the marquise put down her bouquet
marquise-afraid-of-a-mouse

  you arc early armand she said
there was aloofness coldness and a
note of reproach in her voice

  it is very dark in here said la per
ronay

  he pulled the bell then moved for-
ward and laid a hand on the marquises
shoulder

  the assembly he said does not
meet again until six
oclock come lou-
ise arent you glad
to see me

  the marquisestill
unbending again
toyed with her bou-
quet 

   see you so sel-
dom she said that
this is quite an
event

  la ferronay still
stood beside her but
withdrew his caress-
ing hand from her
shoulder

  what is it lou-
ise you are quite
changed to me of
late

  oh no m o n-
sieur that is your
imagination your
mind is so occupied
with the - assem-
bly

  he loved her well
enough to forgive
the cruelty of her
speech

  louise he said

do not let us mis-
understand one an-
other i have stayed
away from you a
great deal of late but
believe me it has been for your sake and
for the sake of france

  the marquise raised her head slowly
and half turned as if to look at him

  is-is she beautiful  she asked
beautiful dont misjudge me lou-
ise for once i want you to listen seri
ously to forget your frivolities your
scented notes your roses

  madame la marquise placed her bou-
quet on the green surface of the table at
her elbow

  my roses monsieur as a dutiful
wife i obey your every command

  la ferronay was stung louise he
retorted there are serious things in
life

  the marquise who had never once
looked at him made
scoffing answer 
indeed perhaps
monsieur will enu-
merate these serious
things

  it is serious
said le ferronay
to find ones wife
trivial and frivolous
when the whole rab-
ble of france is ris-
ing against us

   for the first time
the marquise turned
and looked him
coldly in the eyes

  ah then you
have no doubt quar-
reled i have heard
that her temper is
uncertain

   la f e r r o n a y
w hose m i n d was
again occupied with
that far-off sound
as of the rustling of
the wind in the sere
leaves of a forest
answered absently
madame la mar-
quise there is no
other woman

  he strode to the
window and stared
down into the street 
then raising the
catch he flung open the casement some-
where in the far distance a man was
beating a drum la ferronay turned and
looked at his wife

  vmadame la marquise he said can
you hear that someone is beating a
drum

  louise was nestling her face in the
bouquet of roses she lowered the flowers

aladatne la marquise
o

the red book magazine

now and arranged the disordered petals

 with caressing fingers

certainly i hear it if it is your

 wish she said

   he strode to her side and halted
something of the precision of a soldier
crept into his tones

   louise he said there are grave do-
 ings afoot and we-everyone of us-
 need our utmost courage and devotion
 ihat drum in the
 distance means the
 people are rising

  then you as
an officer should
see that the garde
du corps is called
to disperse them

   la kerr o n a y
 frowned and was
 about to speak but
 at that moment a
 tiny gray mouse
 appeared from un-
 der the spinet it
 paused beneath the
 gleaming chande-
 lier t h e n ran
 swiftly across the
 polished floor

  the marquise
saw it her indif-
ference and hau-
teur fled terror
leapt into her eyes

she drew her gown
about her ankles
and scurried to a
distant corner of
the room

   armand  she
cried to her hus-
band armand  a

mouse-a mouse quick quick drive it
away

 la ferronays lips were closed tightly
 and an angry light flashed into his eyes

   madame la marquise  he began then
 paused and hesitated for the marquise
 hifddied against the wall was indeed a
 beautiful picture her red lips were
 parted and her shining eyes fixed them-
 selves on a fluttering shadow beneath a
 chair she clutched silken skirts about
 her ankles and the light gleamed on her

 golden shoes and mellowed the scarlet
 of her purple-clocked hose she had the
 slenderest and most beautiful ankle in
 all paris so thought the marquis as he
 watched her listening to her little pant-
 ing gasps of fear but of a sudden there
 mingled with her breathing the throb
 hing of the far-off drum perhaps the
 mouse moved in the shadow for again
 the marquise screamed softly and flung
 out an appealing
 white hand la
 ferronays anger
 came to the sur-
 face and he drew
 in his breath

 mom dieu
marquise is that
your courage
afraid of a mouse
and that drum in
the distance is
beating v o u
scream at that
when the whole of
paris is seething
with revolt when
our very lives-
the marquise
gathering her silk-
en petticoats in one
hand and again
pointed out the
tiny shadow

  oh i think it
is under the chair
armand 

  the white hand
shook and little
points of light
leapt and danced
on her jeweled
rings

  la ferronay strode to the chair lifted
it impatiently and banged it down

  do-do you think it has gone cried
the marquise appealingly

  the drum was beating in the distance
yes it has gone and my respect for
you has gone-

  the marquise released her gown and
arranged it very prettily breathing
meantime an air of vast relief

  mon dieushe saidwhat a fright
  i had hoped continued la fer-
marquse-afraid-of-a-mouse	

ronay to find you a brave woman in
this hour of danger but i find you a
coward afraid ol a mouse a coward 
ihe marquise walked slowly to her
tapestried chair

  you are quite sure it has gone ar-
mand 

  ia ferronay who was pacing the
floor with his hands behind his back
stopped exasperated

   have no patience with you lie
said

  nor i with you retorted the mar-
quise with a sudden change of tone and
moreover monsieur la ferronay let me
tell you that when to infidelity you add
abuse you go too far

  that is a lie cried la ferronay i
am not unfaithful

   it is not a lie

   i tell you there is  other woman
if there was  other woman you
would not call me a coward

  the marquise rose from her chair
and continued with great dignity

  you would not forget yourself
monsieur and say that i lied

  la ferronay paused in his walk
and for a moment their eyes met

  i have never loved any woman
but you he said and in your
heart you know it as well as i
do

  perhaps monsieur you will not refer
to my heart which you have done your
best to break

  la ferronay made a step forward and
held out his hands

  come louise he said

but the marquise turned her back
and you will understand monsieur
that after what has occurred i shall find
my own company most agreeable

  then egad louise you shall have
it he cried in a rage

  he strode to the door for a moment
he hesitated then bowed quickly and
went out

ii

   it was not given to men to read a wom-
ans heart and the marquise was what
her husband had made her a delicate
fragile thing a brilliant butterfly to cher-

ish and protect and so when frances
time of travail had come he hid his ober
thoughts in his own heart and she as
he believed now had repaid his sacrifice
by ceasing to love him by flinging in his
face a false charge of neglect and infidel-
ity

  the marquise waited until her hus-
bands footsteps had died away then
with a glance at the spot where the mouse-
had disappeared seated herself in her

chair placed her golden slippers  the
footstool and stared into the glowing
depths of the fire

  her husbands contempt at her terror
had angered her more than a volume of
cruel words and as she sat there staring
into the blaze she regretted her dismis
sal of him  she would have liked him
back again-that she might wound him
again and again with the sting of her
tongue in truth he had escaped too
cheaply and if-

de bainville stood upon the threshold

   being a woman and a hundred fath-
 oms deep she was not aware that her an-
 ger was but a sham a moving surface
 feeling and that it served its purpose of
 obscuring the half-stifled promptings of
 her heart

   ihe door opened again and this time
 the chevalier de bainville stood upon the
 threshold his hat pressed upon his heart
 and his face wreathed in smiles

   he closed the door and advanced to
 the marquise with obtrusive elegance he
 bent over her hand and-kissed it

  the marquise permitted him to be
 seated

   your husband questioned de bain-
 ville

   is out he left me just now in a fit
 of temper

   you received my note

   the marquise drew out the drawer in
 the green-topped table and pointed

   among your treasures laughed de
 bainville let me see them

  he moved elegantly towards the
 drawer and took out a gold rimmed quiz-
 zing-glass

   that was my fathers said the mar-
quise

   de bainville put back the glass and
inspected a pair of paste shoe-buckles

   my wedding shoe-buckles

   and this cried de bainville hold-
ing up a necklace of chrvsoprase

   ihe marquise shrugged her shoulders

   a gift of la ferronays she said
hut look at this strangely carved ivory
head

   she held it towards de bainville who
seized her hand in both of his and cried
with sudden earnestness

   louise what is your answer

   the color deepened on the marquise s
cheeks

   oh conrad i cannot come

   but your husband no longer loves
you

   the marquise raised her head again
and looked at him

   ah if  only knew that she mur-
mured

   but i have given you proof urged
de bainville and you say he but now
left you in a fit of temper

   that is true answered the mar-
quise he called me a coward and said
i lied to him

   he dared to say that and yet you
hesitate louise say you will come now
and all my life i will be your slave oh
louise i love you you know i would
lay down mv life for you he had been
kneeling at her side looking into her
face his voice broke and yet-and yet
you hesitate

   i he marquises hand moved towards
him ever so slightly

  conrad she whispered do you
really-really love me

  de bainville was an accomplished
courtier and he seized his opportunity

   flattery that unfair bait was dangled
subtly and seductively before her the
marquis had treated her ill he had neg-
lected the most beautiful woman in the
world

   conrad broke in the woman we
are but a year married and he used to
vow he loved me just as you are doing
now

   i have given you proof that-that he
has other interests said de bainville
m arquise-a f rai d-of-a-mouse



  and you will love me always whis-
  pered the marquise

   de bainville seized her hands in his

  always he answered

  after a pause the marquise spoke
again then  will come to-night

  but de bainville was not satisfied

  my carriage he said is waiting in
the street you must come at once iou
ise say you will come now

  lhe marquise released her hands from
his grasp

  i will come she whispered

  de bainville moved forw-ard eagerly

   will get my cloak continued the
marquise holding him away from her

  she smiled at him and moved slowly
and doubtfully towards the door

  when she was gone de bainville ar-
ranged his neckcloth with minute care
at the mirror over the mantel

  easier than i expected he said
 ma eh ere louise has one of the prettiest
private fortunes in france  the quarrel
with m le marquis was opportune

  he began to walk up and down the
room humming an air he had fine cause
to be satisfied with himself for in his
whole adventurous life he had never be-
fore achieved a coup of this magnitude

  presently the door opened and instead
of the marquise a sergeant of the gane
du corps stood upon the threshold the
man brought his heels sharply together
and saluted

  monsieur le marquis de la ferro-
nay he asked

  h is out said de bainville recov-
ering from his astonishment what do
you want

  monsieur he is required at the palace
at once lhe people are rising

  de bainville had heard reports of this
kind before therefore he dismissed it
with the arrogance of his class he con-
tinued his walk

  you are of the garde it is your place
to put down the rising

  i am afraid monsieur the people will
be too much for us unless his majesty
can be persuaded to visit the assembly

hn called me a coward

the red book magazine

  hut why do you seek the marquis

asked de bainville impatiently

  he has great influence with the
king said the sergeant and lias
averted danger many times already

   he paused and listened for a moment

  monsieurt do you hear that they
arc beating the drums in the champs de
mars

   de bainville paused in his walk and
looked sharply at him

    there is danger he asked

  very great danger does monsieur
know tinn the mob have murdered the
due dauniale 

  murdered the due daumale cried
de bainville his eyes dilating of a sud
den his easy nonchalance of manner for-
sook him he paused and listened to the
beating of the far-off drum and that ris-
ing murmur as of wind in the sere leaves
of a forest the sergeant too was lis-
tening he half-turned to leave the
room

  they are coming this way mon-
sieur he said seriously there is not
much time to spare  must find m le
marquis

   he moved to the door closed it behind
him and de bainville heard his footsteps
receding down the corridor

  a few moments the chevalier paused
intent on the rising wave of sound still
dominated by the incessant rattle of a
drum 

  mon dieu this is getting beyond a
joke  what a time she is

  suddenly a shot was fired de bain-
ville started and looked about him then
hurried to the window opened it cau-
tiously and peered out the rabble was
at the street-end a roar of voices smote
his ears

   mon dieu he cried recoiling with
a colorless face they are firing at the
due de villeneuves windows

  a few stragglers from the mob ran
down the rue de moneau the rush of
their footsteps put new terror into him

    this is no time for a man to encum-
ber himself with a woman he muttered

  the mob had turned and was moving
down the rue de moneau  more shots
were fired like a flash de bainville re-

membered ins carriage and seizing his
hat went stealthily towards the door he
opened it cautiously and stepped out
without closing it behind him



  he had been gone five minutes when
tile marquise entered cloaked and ready
for her journey she crossed the thres-
hold drawing on her gloves

  i am ready conrad she said

  a startled look crossed her face at
finding the room empty a roar of voices
reached her ears from the street below

   suddenly there was a crackle of glass
and a stone crashed through the window
and rolled bounding over the floor al-
most at her feet all the color left the
marquises face

  conrad conrad she called

  but there was no answer save the roar
of voices in the street below

  suddenly for a moment the crowd
grew silent she ventured to the window
and peered out just as a rain of heavy
blows resounded through the house

  the marquise fell back swayed and
clutched at the window-curtains

  mon dieu the rabble she whis-
pered they have stopped here-they
are breaking in the door

  something fell with a crash and cries
of exultation reached her this time they
were within the house and running feet
were mounting the stairs for a few sec-
onds the marquise remained at the win-
dow her hands were clasped together
and her dilated eyes were fixed on the
door they were about to enter she
knew already that it was too late never-
theless she made her way to the bell-
rope and pulled it with all her strength
far away in the servants-quarters the
bell jangled impotently there was a
roaring in her ears hammers seemed to
beat on her head a thousand warring
sounds rent the air then after an etern-
ity of suspense the doors crashed open
and evil white faces stared at her from
the threshold

  she covered her eyes with her hands
and became conscious that the room was
full of people - a whistling shouting
cyo

 who is going to make her drink he cried


the red hook magazine

jeering mob the scum of paris-let loose
in that luxurious apartment big black-
ened hands seized the marquises wrists
and forced them away from her eyes she
saw a red liearded man thrust his face
forward and call her endearing names
a lean pallid youth with prominent eyes
was smashing the mirrors with a billet of
wood and screaming a gutter ballad a
tattered old woman peered close at the
marquises neck then with a scream
sprang up and tore away her locket on its
golden chain

  suddenly the leader of the rabble a
butcher with hair rubled glossy with suet
sprang forward and seizing the pallid
youth by the neck hurled him back-
wards he made a dash at the red
bearded man who retreated into the
crowd then he placed his own arm
about tile marquise she tried to release
herself but he broke into a coarse laugh

  phe pallid youth resumed his ballad
and the rabble took it up the marquise
ceased to struggle and her soul died
within her for the butcher was young
and powerful with evil features the
rabble began a wild dance circling round
and round the butcher and the marquise

  just then there came a disturbance at
the door those nearest it ceased their
singing and stared on the threshold

with a drawn sword in his hand stood
the marquis de la ferro nay de cars

 he candlelight gleamed and twinkled
on his blade his bold calin gliincc sought
the marquise something like a smiw-
came into the corners of his mouth

   i hen the red bearded man sprang to-
wards him with uplifted weapon the
dance had ceased there fell a minutes
silence and  a ferronays blade entered
the red learded mans side for a mo-
ment the rabble gazed some at the
wounded man now writhing on the floor
and some at la ferronay cool and up-
right but four paces nearer the marquise
again lie moved forward and another
man fell but now the crowd awoke to
action and a dozen men dashed at him
together  is sword flashed amid a dozen
weapons

   for an almost imperceptible space of
time la ferronay had the better of the
fight against them all the blood flowed
again in the marquis v veins but at that
moment pablo the butcher who had
been holding her in his arms seized his
cleaver and made toward la ferronay
with the strength of despair the mar
quise seized his wrist and held him then
it was that the hag who had stolen the
marquises locket crouched forward and
clutched la ferronays legs he tottered
a man sprang in on him from behind

la ferronay had moved
m a rquse-a f r aid-o f-a- mouse

u

and iablo who had released himself
from the marquises grasp struck him
with the broadside of his cleaver la fer-
ronays blade slipped from his grasp he
raised his hands then came down face
forward  the floor

  he knew how to handle a sword the
marquis said pablo pulling la ferro-
nay over on his back

  ihe marquise was clinging to the ta-
ble-edge swaying violently the pallid
youth with a glass in his hand staggered
to la ferronays prostate body

  your health monsieur he said

  pablo was again at the marquises
side  she struggled trying to beat him
off but he laughed in her face

  not yet ma mignonne he said
forcing her into the tapestried chair

  here he cried to the pallid youth
give me that glass

  he put it into the marquises hands
and closed her fingers upon it now

 madame la marquise you will drnik a
 health with me

  he took a glass himself and raised it

  monsieur le marquis de la ferronay
 iles cars he said making a mocking
 bow to the prostrate body  the tioor

   the marquise still held the wine in her
 hand she was motionless as a statue

  drink  commanded pablo

  drink shouted the crowd closing
 round her chair

  the marquise released her fingers and
 let her glass drop to the floor

  ihe hag sprang at her and received a
 blow from pablo that sent her back into
 the crowd

  pablo put his own glass in the mar-
 quises hand and again closed her fin-
 gers over it he thrust his evil face close
 to hers

  now drink  he ordered

  no said the marquise never
 she was very beautiful despite her

oh he murmured i can hod out no longer i 
the red book magazine

deathlike pallor and pablo put a light
hand on her arm then rose and looked at

the crowd

    ho is going to make her drink he
tried

a roar of voices filled the room 
will i will silence fell for a moment

we will cast lots for it said pablo

i le drew forth a dice-box and dropped

the dice on the tabic

  a drunken bootmaker shook lirst and
laughed when four came uppermost

   twelve to win cried pablo

   then the pallid youth shook and fell
short now followed first one and then
another but all failed to throw twelve
and for a time the marquise was forgot-
ten irresistibly her eyes turned to where
la ferronay lay she rose and made a
step or two towards him then stopped
and drew a deep breath

  la ferronay had moved

  the marquise slipped back into fter
chair he was alive and all her womans
courage and devotion mounted at the
thought he had fought for her she
too would fight for him

   pablo threw twelve and on the fringe
of the crowd someone murmured that
they were pablos dice but the butcher
did not heed them he turned to the mar-
quise

   you have fallen to me we will drink
his health together-just you and me
no one shall see us

   before the marquise could comprehend
his meaning he had cleared the room
locked the door and placed the key on
the table

iv

  they were alone together but the
crowd was still outside the door

   five minutes pablo five minutes
railed the rabble not a minute more

   do you hear that my beautifulsaid
pablo standing before the marquise de-
canter and glass in hand

   the marquise glanced furtively at la
ferronay then taking her courage in
both hands

   am glad you sent them away she
said

 pablo thought he had not heard aright

 what is that he asked

  will drink his health said the mar
 quise and she held out her hand for the
 glass

 pablo staied at her in amazement

  ou mean that 

  hated him replied the marquise

 pablos peasant-cunning made him
 hesitate

 you are not lying to me he ques-
 tioned suspiciously

 give me the glass

 pablo handed it to her she rose and
 held it aloft

 to the marquis de la ferronay des
 cars she said in a clear voice and
 drank

 saere dieu cried pablo  have
 seen you in the bois in your carriage you
 looked like a pretty sevres figure  never
 thought you were a woman with blood in
 your veins

 the marquise looked him steadily in
 the face

 you were wrong monsieur i am a
 woman

 there was a bold light in pablos eyes
 as he returned her gaze the marquise
 recoiled  then her sharp ears detected a
 sound behind him at any cost she must
 keep his attention from la ferronay

 ah monsieur pablo you hatter me 

 she motioned him to a chair but he
 came and seated himself on the edge of
 the table near her his manner was easy
 and familiar

 then you hated the marquis

 like poison only to-day  charged
 him with loving another woman

 pablo broke into a laugh

 we men are all of a piece dont
 trust us marquise

 in the background la ferronay
 sighedand opened his eyes pablo sprang
 to his feet

 whats that  thought i heard some-
 thing

 a mouse under that rhair answered
 the marquise quickly

 it was more than a mouse said
 pablo uneasily

 ah then your friends have found
 their way to the cellar and are broach-
 ing the wine
time is up pablo

  la ferronay drew himself up to a sit-
ting posture and passed his hand over
his brow he was dazed with his wound
but already the situation began to dawn
upon him he knew there would be no
hope for them when the mob returned
for a minute he leaned heavily on his
hands and then began to drag himself
towards the sword which lay beyond h
reach

  the marquise still held pablos atten-
tion his confidence had returned

  come marquise he said you are
prettily spoken but you sit too far
away

  he was seated on the edge of the green
topped table and as he leaned over to
grasp her hand he caught sight of the
open drawer

  let me show you my treasures said
the marquise quickly she took up the
paste shoe-buckles my wedding shoe-

buckles a carved ivory head from the
indies-my fathers quizzing-glass

  for a minute pablos cupidity was
aroused by the richness of the trinkets
then he caught sight of de bainvilies
letter and seized it

  a letter he said breaking into a
laugh so you women are not to be
trusted either

  ihe marquises gaze wandered to la
ferronay who had reached his sword
for a moment their eyes met the mar-
quises ebbing courage flowed again pah

lo	was turning the letter this way and
that

  come marquise read it to me he
said

  read it questioned the marquise
taking it from his hand

  pablo was looking over her shoulder

  yes read it to me

s
the red hook magazine

   you see he was a poet aid the

marquise

   i-a ferronay was crawling slowly to-
wards them at the leat sound pablo
would have turned and seen him

   what docs in say persisted pablo
lhe marquise scrutinized the letter
closely for a minute and then began to
speak

   first he begins said the mar quia
pretending to read the letter  my own
angel lrom heaven on tuesday when
the crescent moon hung low i saw thee
driving in the bois thine ivory hand
within the carriage-gloom was gloved in
silver light 

    the man is a fool interjected pabltf
the marquise continued   then thou
didst beckon me  she paused faltered
and then again continued  and  ike a
shining needle from the woods black
depths i shot as to a mighty magnet 
t faith cried pablo he is the
greatest fool in the world

   all poets are mad said the mar-
quise  shot as to a mighty magnet-
what does the fellow mean
lhe marquise went on radiant
against- 

   then of a sudden her courage left her
oh armand she murmured i can
hold out no longer -

  with a supreme effort la ferronay
had raised himself into a chair

  armand questioned pablo
thats a mans name

   i he marquise started yes oh this
poets mad

   these men are all mad said pablo
w e have had a great deal of talk come
a kiss

   he breathed heavily for a moment
and then drawing her close against him
tilted her chin with his grimy hand

   i hen it was that la ferronay called
out in a sharp voice

   pablo sprang to his feet and stared at
the wounded man who was seated in a
chair holding a sword in his hand

   the suddenness of the apparition and
something in la ferronays steady gaze
struck fear into his heart

  he glanced at the door and then
turned to the marquise

   where is the key he whispered

  but the marquise was too quick for
him she- seized u from the table and ran
to la ierronays side the key of the
door armand she said

   at last iablo realized the part sin had
played and he turned on her his evil
face distorted with rage

  you she-devil you shall pay for
this

  no my friend said la ferronay
it is you who shall pay

   he placed a hand on his wifes arm
and drew himself to his feet his face
was very pale and his sword appeared
to hang somewhat unsteadily in his hand

   pablo drew a breath of relief

  sou arc wounded he cried and
made a savage rush

   stand back called la ferronay

   for the space of less than a minute he
held pablo at bay then the butcher
raised his arm for a sweeping stroke and
la ferronays blade darted into his side

  a thrilling horror gleamed in the
mans eyes he staggered towards the
door calling as he went 

   comrades citizens 

   hen he had made four paces he
halted spun on his heels and crashed to
the floor

   lhe marquise did not heed him for
la ferronay had fainted and was lying
unconscious with one hand drawn up
over his closed eyes

  armand whispered the marquise
removing the hand and looking close into
his face

  he was breathing faintly and the
marquise smoothed back his hair there
was a bleeding wound on the forehead
but sne took his face in her slender white
hands and laid her lips lightly on his

  armand you shall live she mur-
mured you shall live

  for a tender moment all remembrance
of their danger had left her

v

  many more than five minutes had
elapsed and the rabble abandoned the
cellars and began to clatter up the stairs
towards the chamber outside the door a

party of them raised a good-humored

 shout

five minutes pablo-five minutes

   the marquise leapt to her feet then
 speeding to the door very softly bolted
 it top and bottom there was wine on
 the little green-topped table she took
 some now and poured it between her hus-
 bands lips

   a shiver passed over him  she saw the
 color creep back into his cheeks and her
 own breath caught in her throat as she
 murmured a little prayer of thankful-
 ness

   another sound on the other side of the
 door caused her to start springing up
 she ran across the room and stooped her
 cheek pressed against the panel listening
 the stillness without was ominous she
 knew they were waiting all patiently
 the passing of the allotted time then a
 sigh fell upon her straining ears quickly
 gathering up her flowing robe she glided
 over to ferronay and kneeling half-
 raised him an age it seemed to her she
 waited with bated breath for another
 sign of life of which the sigh had fur-
 nished evidence

  presently he opened his eyes and
found her caressing arms about him her
face was close to his and very visible
there was a yearning tender look that
surprised him he read the look a cry
escaped her lips

   armand i loved you all the time-
i loved you but i was jealous and it
made me bitter and cruel oh i was
cruel to you-to you who would have
laid down your life for me

	louise dont say that help me up
i-

   you dont hate me asked the mar
quise searching his face

  even in that moment la ferronay
found courage for a smile he tried to
raise a hand to draw her down to him

    wronged you terribly more than
you can ever know confessed the mar-
quise

   louise said la ferronay turning
 to where pablo lay in a heap you had
 the rourage to keep that great fellow at
 bay you have courage to stay here now

and yet i dared to call you a coward
all the time the crowd had been whis-
pering and laughing outside the door
now a voice cried 

  time is up pablo

  the handle was turned and a ram of
blows fell on the door

  open the door did she drink his
health pablo did she drink it

  a fellow put his mouth to the keyhole
if you dont open pablo we will
kick it down

  the marquise had helped her husband
to a sitting posture he was still too weak
to stand his eyes were fixed upon the
door wondering how long it would hold

the marquise left his side and took up
the pistol he had dropped when he en-
tered the room she put the weapon into
his hand then taking his sword in her
own right hand she stood up la ferro-
nay was reclining weakly against her
knee her left hand was in his she was
standing very straight but the sword
would have been but poor avail in those
unaccustomed fingers

  there was a diversion outside and
someone fired a shot

  they are firing into the lock said
la ferronay it wont last much longer
suddenly came a great rattle of shots
a rush of feet the blows on the door
stopped and a crowd seemed to be strug-
gling on the landing without

  la ferronay looked into his wifes
face and she smiled down at him

  we will die together you will not
let them take me alive armand she
said

  louise i think it is coming now
said la ferronay

  he laid his lips to his wifes hand
then waited listening to the splintering
blows that repeatedly thundered on the
door

  a panel fell and then another the
door crashed inwards and a sergeant and
twenty men of the national guard stood
grouped in the door-way

  the marquise did not understand but
la ferronay looked into her eyes

    marquise-af raid-of-a-mouse  he said
i think they have come-just in time

quickly answering the youthful speaker
with a smile

the while her needle the faster as if
fearful lest in her interest in the boy be-

stant her tedious task

worn fingers amongst the many folds of
her shabby skirt the child eyed the ap-
pearance of a sadly shrunken leather
purse wdth a wistful awe what a wrorld
ful of wealth that tiny pouch had con-

he could remember that little leather bag

the daily bread and dripping the weekly
roast of meat-and the annual plum-

pected the boy promptly

  it proved to be a silver sixpence at
sight of which the boys eyes bulged big-
ger than before sixpence six copper
pennies silvered and compressed togeth-
er  how many farthings were contained
in such a stupendous sum assuredly
sufficient to buy balloons of blue and
every other hue and enough over to se-
cure sugarsticks of every known fanciful

  i have nothing less than a penny

ingenuously

  theres nothing we want boy said

	he woman with unconscious humor her
gaze wandering reluctantly from her
work and roving the mean room to rest
upon a corner-cupboard that did duty
in the ingenuity of its arrangement for
pantry playbox clothes-closet and coal-

the disappointed hearer the whine verg-
ing upon a whimper blacking or-or
bread-or needles and thread-or but-

spiration you said we could have a
treat for supper mother he reminded

  and so i did jack so i did the

  and presently this small room situatf

the steep descent to the street so far be-
low scorning to tread the stone steps to
slide with a speed and dexterity born
only of long practice the slippery iron
banisters arrived at length at the gro-
cers on the corner across the noisy way

trance to watch with envy changed to
anticipation the merry flight of bill
jones balloon as it soared aloft in a
sudden gust of wind to dance above tall
lamp-posts and gamboling higher and
higher bounce about the cottage chim-
ney-pots in a vain attempt to break loose
from its hampering tail of string

  with a grin of great self-satisfaction
in the direction of his balloon-blessed
friend jack sauntered into the shop

  and what can i do for you to-day
my little man inquired the grocerfrom
behind an enormous mound of tinned
sardines and stilton cheese

  if yer please sir i want-i want-
the customer stayed his lips to purse
them in his predicament and frown  and
scratch his faithless head and turn his
eyes upon the comprehensive nature of
his strong-smelling surroundings in
hopeless search for the missing want

   twas someing-someing fer free
fardens he explained eagerly

  ah said the stout shopman and
raised his brows with the suspicion of a
smile ye was na thinkin o buvin me

  jack shook his head at the cheese m

toward a family of intoxicated flies and
a tin of treacle

  following on this lucky thought the
boy began a strenuous search the pantry
was ransacked from bottom to top and
from top to bottom the playbox peered
into from shelf to shelf the clothes-
closet probed to the uttermost cobwebby
corner and even the coal-cellar not
overlooked in the hunt for the absent
book but all to no purpose

  you aint a-settin on it i spose
mother to make you igher is you sue
gested jack at a venture

  well i never exclaimed the worn
an upon this remarkable discovery
how did the book get under there
and turning tenderly the rubbed-cloth
cover she read softly aloud a sprawled
inscription

  marjorie miggins born january
the first ninetffn-vmndred-and-five

died december the twenty-fifth nine-
teen-hundred-and-six 



  a little later the good-natured grocer
across the way emerged again from the
privacy of his back parlor to answer the
summoning ring of his shop-door bell

  so so mister free-fardens yes
back again is ye he jocularly ob-
served taking a piece of paper from an
outstretched grimy paw whats this
- a thought f jr to-day  he read
with a disparaging sniff   the road to
greatness through a desert winds
humph  the thirsting traveler press-
ing on the oasis of fame a mirage- 

  if yer please sir turn over to the
margarine sir advised the child

  the margarine yes yes to be sure
phis is more like it a quarter-a-pound
of d marjorien humph

  jack his purchase made meandered
again past three scattered biscuit-boxes
and two tempting apple-barrels from
tiie stout shopkeepers smiling view his
farthing clutched tightly with the yield-
ing packages he came into the street
there to meet a woe-begone bill jones
trailing in deep dejection a burst bal-
loon

  this sad if gratifying scene gave rise
to much thought in the nimble brain of
the beholder and the faint cries of ole
cloe-any ole doe-any bottles an
ole cloe from the now far-distant bar-
row-man floated less seductively to his
ears

  the space between the perturbed pos-
sessor of the farthing and thebarrerful
of balloons had been lessened by but one-
half when the boy paused to contem-
plate in a rush of cloying memories the
window display of an especially well-
favored sweet-stuff shop

  ole cloe-any ole cloe-any bot-
tles an ole cloe was wafted on the
wind to where he stood surveying endless
big-stoppered bottles of brandy-balls and
countless jars of sugar-sticks curly
ugar-sticks of brown clove straight
sugar-sticks of scarlet strawberry  striped
sugar-sticks of red raspberry spotted
sugar-sticks of green gooseberry was
when the ship comes home



even the first ada - ever so tempted
the childish mouth watered the earth-
ly substance of the sugar-sticks overcame
the more ethereal fascination of the bal-
loons he went in

  what flavor would you like sonny
questioned the dame in the dim interior
rising to forget her rheumatism in the
fulfillment of the customers request

  jacks choice hovered between curly
clove and straight strawberry finally to
fall upon the former and the farthing
being discovered in the act of pushing
its way through the flimsy wrapping to
immerse itself in the margarine the oily
coin and the cane of clove changed
hands the one to vanish with a demur-
ring chink and a rattle of remonstrance
into a cracked cup the other to disap-
pear slowly down into the darkness of a
rapacious maw

  alas for the fickleness of human de-
sire  within a minute from the consump-
tion of the stick of peppery clove a toy
balloon on the end of a line of string
seemed to jack the most precious posses-
sion this poor world had to offer

  ole cloe-any ole cloe-any bot-
tles an ole cloe was wafted once more
in a sing-song monotone from the neigh-
boring street and heavy of heart and
sick of stomach the hearer bent his feet
again toward the six flights of steep stone
stairs oh that man had made banisters
for little boys to slide up that led to
the topmost story of muggs model
dwellings for the poor-and home

  hey  jack boy  and yere here again
are ye like a beggar at the back door
cried his mother cheerily upon his
breathless return but yeve made a
fearsome mess of the margarine

  it-it jes melted on me mumbled
the accused an-an mother he con-
tinued as the other closed the book
which still lay open before her you
know that farden i-i lawst it

  oh jack lawst it was ever such
a silly boy and where dye lose it or
was it stole 

  i-i dont knowmourned jack with
a gulp i-i was jes going along an-
an i lawst it

  and he commenced to cry

  there there i soothed he listener

in a sudden kindliness ol sympathy
come to yer mother jack boy and
she lifted the forlorn little figure to
place him gently upon her knee yer
mothers own baby aint ye she whis-
pered as he pressed his stained face
against her bosom

  the muffled weeping dwindled to sobs
to die at last in generous sniffs and
then ever so slightly jack lifted his
head

  kin i-kin i ave-kin i ave another
farden he brokenly begged

  mercy on us chile exclaimed the
mother dye think were made o
money-there there jacky but yell
drowned yer prooty eyes if ye takes an-
other spell o bawling come come be a
man  and you shall have a farthing j ack
-you shall have farthings and farthings
-when my ship comes home

  when the ship comes ome said
jack with brightening eyes foregoing
his grief in an excitement of surprise

  when the ship comes home re-
peated the woman in a whisper to-
morrow perhaps or the next day

  and she stayed her stitching to stoop
and kiss away a single coursing tear

  oh jack -jack

  but jack was wise he closed his eyes
and his snores told how he slept where-
upon the mothers reproach melted back
to tenderness and she kissed again the
fragrant lips that now were parted in
the joy of a wondrous dream the dream
was of a ship with sugar-stick masts and
balloons for canvas it came sailing gal-
lantly up mr muggs stairs with the
rheum-racked dame in command upon
the quarter-deck and bill jones in gold-
laced glory at the wheel

wonder-

jack-jack came agaiu the low

cry

  the child peered with quickening
breath into the gloom of the fire-lighted
room toward where within the narrow
doorway loomed a strange and sinister
form

  wheres the missis nipper asked a
hoarse voice

  in a sudden fit of terror the child
shrank back against the wall

  gar bless ye son i aint a-going to
hurt ye assured the dim shape

   tis a sailorman from off the ship
jack suddenly bethought him and as if
to strengthen this suspicion and dispel
his fears the intruder approached with a
true nautical lumbering as if his heavy
boots still trod the pitching planks of an
unstable craft

  wheres the missis nipper came
the question again shell be a-shopping
now im reckoning an she wont be
ome for quite a piece im a-thinking
son added the stranger with more of
assertion

  and seating his square person clumsily
upon the extreme edge of the couch as
if fearful of its limitations or unused to
such soft places he heaved a great sigh
and commenced with minute earnest-
ness to scan his meager surroundings
dwelling at mysterious length on every-
thing discernible in the dusk and missing
nothing

  i-i kin o likes sailormans an-
an ships stammered master jack at a
venture timidly

  the man stared aroused from his rev-
erie

  bless the kid if i hadnt clean for-
got ye he said stand ye down lad
and lets take a long long look at yer
but yer a-growing son a-growing good
yare top yer ole dad afore long so yer
will top yer ole dad exclaimed the
stranger standing his subject off at
arms length an yer every inch as
sturdy ill be bound he concluded
evry inch as sturdy

and bending forward he grasped the
lad by the ears and hoisted him from

his startled teer to r place beside him ob
the sofa

  jus as sturdy evry blessed bit he
repeated admiringly not another nip-
per twicet yer size in all london would
ha stood that wiout a squeal

  but it urt said jack ruefully
blinking his blue eyes and breathing very
hard

  in course it urt said the man feel-
ingly but yere a plucky un son a real
plucky un but what was yer a-saying
about ships and sailormen he ques-
tioned curiously its a-dreaming yeve
bin im thinking

  i dremp confided jack as the man
took him upon a very hard and very bony
knee mothers ship corned ome an-
an it was luvly

  ha murmured the man and turned
his close-cropped head so the ole gel s
ship come omedid itsonin yer dreams
and yer took me when ye see me for a
sailor did ye the cappin mebbe eh

  yes eagerly agreed the boy i
knowed it-ye was the cappin and did
yer bring lots an lots of fardens wid yer
mother said as ow thered be lots of far-
dens

  and with the contempt bred of close
acquaintance the speaker slipped five
small fingers adroitly into the nearest
pocket of the mans coat to draw forth
with a whistle of astonishment a mon-
strous jack-knife

  what yer got yer young beggar
cried the dispossessed sharply tut
lad he continued more kindly i aint
a-scolding of yer is afeared yed cut
yer precious fingers boy

  thats what yer cuts yer bacca wid
aint it commented jack with returning
smiles lets see yer chew mister sail-
orman he pleaded with an upward
glance at the disappointingly motionless
jaws like sailors chews

  the same little innocent j murmured
the man taking caressingly the pinched
upturned tiny features between his
rough palms the same little innocent
as used to stan on his ead for pots o
beer in the sawdust of the back parlor of
the ole red lion-gaw bless im ye

added aloud

   reckon  kin came the answer
proudly i kin do ye deliberated mas
ter jack i kin do ye a stan-on-me-ead
if ye kin do me a ornpipe mister sailor
man he bargained brightly

  but on his struggling to free himself
for the boasted periormance the stranger
sealed the compact with a restraining
hug

  another time son he said another
time mister sailorman is too tired jus
now fer ornpiping but tell us lad dye
recollek yer ole dad  but no yer would-

  i members a bit of im reflected the
boy es dead now i reckon he con-
cluded with cheerful resignation

  ah an he was like-what was he

   e was like- the speaker for a
similie searched the apartment the din-
giness of its scant furnishings softened
in the glow of the dying fire-like you
someing he remarked at last dubious-
ly ony fatter an-an-

 wit whiskers

  wit whiskers

  upon this followed a silence and
presently the boy traveled back into
dreamland and to the dangers and de-
lights of his phantom-ship into the eyes
of mister sailorman as he watched the
course of the wondrous craft traced upon
the sleeping features crept a light of
yearning love

v

  bill-bill

  the stranger roused with a guilty
start and placing the nestling form up-
on the couch turned to confront the
newcomer

  i begs yer pardin missis he said
foolishly i-ive come from im -
bill

  and he shuffled uneasily a few steps
into the deeper shadows of a comer

  youve come from im repeated the
woman in tense whispering tones sit
yer down sir and she nervously placed
a chair before the fire dropping her
packages upon the table she moved
swiftly to the cupboard

  wll take a drop o heer she ip

vited spdling the contents of a bottle
into a glass returning she seated her-
self before the stranger untying with
feverish fingers her bonnet-strings and
watching impatiently the disappearance
of the proffered liquor in her distressful
anxiety to receive the strangers news

  ah breathed the man with more
of composure returning the emptied cup
yes missis ive come-yer very excel-
lent ealth he apologized wiping his
lips ive come from bill ive come
from bill to say-to say-

  he will be free finished the wom-
an and when

  she laid a hand impulsively upon tht
strangers sleeve

  free yes he wrill be free to-mor-
row or the next day-maybe-he will
be free

  and you you were in there too
the man nodded his eyes staring into
the dull red embers of the grate and as
he stared the slim bars became the barriers
that for long months past had looked
down in silent mociry upon him and his
misery and in the dancing flames were
fashioned the forbidding  alls which
had that day frowned upon h s departure
from the grim prison of pentonville

  we was near neighbors me and
bill he said as if to himself

  you were in the next-the next cell
to him

  and times there were he went on
without noting the interruption when
we used to talk together

  with tappings on the wall urged
the eager listener

  for two years we was together and
we got to kind o know each other me
and bill and times there was at first
when he was a-fretting his eart out
times when i used to set and wonder
what a man could do to deserve it-two
years in that ere hell

  the strangers toilworn hands gripped
convulsively the sides of his seat in a
sudden restraint of passion and the
woman shrank involuntarily from the
lined face the fire-light revealed

  two years he resumed muttering
two years o having yer limbs shackled
like a slaves and yer body fed like a
heast  until the irons afp into vfiir soul

and from a man yer grew-yer grew to
a devil n

  the slumbering form upon tiie couch
stirred and at the sound the stranger

turned

  there was a little gel a little baby
gel bill used always to be a-telling of
shell be abed missis in the other room
im a-thinking if  could just take a
peep at her-me being kind o fond o
little gels-

  the speaker ceased speaking abruptly
to clutch his silent companion by the
sleeve

  dont say shes-that he gasped
dont tell me missis the little gels
gone in her eyes he read the truth and
let fall his head between his hands

   as if to break the heavy stillness there
came from the lips of the dreaming boy
a troubled muttering and the man rose
unsteadily to his feet

  dont ye be ninding me missis he
went on apoogetically dont ye be
minding me but id got to grow kind o
fond o bills little gel and theres
times missis times a longing comes over
me times when  seems to see your bill
a-setting in his cell and a-thinking
thinking on her-his baby gel  thems
times missis times a longing comes over
me to meet-to meet the man that sent
him there his hand stole to his pocket
and from the gleam in his eyes the wom-
an shrank

  but i begs yer pardin missis he
went on id best be a-going im think-
ing and here-

  he drew from an inner pocket a small
full-shaped bag

  heres something i come nigh on fer-
getting its from bill and he asked me
missis he asked me for to give it yer
the womans fingers closed in bewil-
derment upon the gift as she faced the
man fearfully in the half-darkness
searching his shadowed features for signs
to confirm or dissipate a growing dread

  but bill she cried faintly he will
be free he will be home to-morrow or
-or the next day

  he-he is free missis he come out
this day did bill along o me

  the man drew still further back be-
yond the circle of light rast n the glow

from the hearth and his fingers sought
the latch of the door

  but yer dont understand missis-
he continued huskily yer dont under-
stand what it means to a man-two
years in there what is it think ye makes
im take wi never a murmur the kicks
and curses of his feller men fear o the
gun-when a bullet through his eart ud
be the biggest blessing the pore devil
could wish or is it because he must live
for the sake of the missis an the kids
or is because he must live to meet agin
the man that sent him with a word from
all he loved on gawds earth  to break
their earts and wreck his body-and his
soul what is it think ye missis what
is it makes im scratch a mark each night
on the wall of his prison because it
shows im another day nearer ome or
another day nearer the reckoning with
his judge

  the voice of the speaker died in a
sibilant whispering to a hush and with
a moan the woman drooped her head be-
tween her arms thrown wide across the
table in an agony of disappointment and
despair

  at the door the man paused and
turned backward in seeming indecision
his fingers confusedly fumbling his
coarse cap

  good-by he breathed good-by

  then he stepped a pace nearer the
motionless figure at the table

  mister sailorman mister sailor-
man came a complaining cry from out
the darkness yere a-going away an a-
fergetting of the ompipe ye promised
me

  the nipper muttered the man id
amost fergot the nipper

  his right hand was withdrawn reluct-
antly from his pocket

  gawd fergive me i he murmured
brokenly then ive come on board
mate he said aloud slipping an arm
about the womans bowed shoulders
ive come aboard

  bill she cried bill for then
she knew

  and a minute later-i reckon
mused the little wondering boy upon the
couch-i reckon as i aint the ony one
as kin o likes ships an sailormans

 wedding chimes at red dog

                by harry irving greenf
                illustrated by fred woods

a t the time alfalfa cheyenne red
 and i burst into the game and be-
came particcps crimini in the tragedy
that followed our conception as to how
the affair had originated was immature
and crude however that did not pre-
vent us from helping boost the proceed-
ings along to a delirious finish for we
are opportunists by nature and boosters
by trade later on however we learned
that the matter had had its inception in
the dim past and somewhat to-wit

  for years old peckaway strong had
been the sole possessor of the golden
goose gopher-pocket mine up on quartz
mountain and all that time it had been
laying him a steady stream of nuggets
while down in the valley wash rideout
had for an equal period claimed the
ownership with all its appliances ap-
purtenances and hereditaments of a pla-
cer-mine that spread the bottoms of his
pans with yellow dust thick as butter on
flapjacks as to which was the better

paying property mine or placer the
world wotted not for during all that
time peck and wash had kept on peck-
ing and washing and salting away their
rake-off in a satisfied silence until at the
time their long-standing friendship blew
up each had cached away a pile of the
yellow-boys that would have made the
gold specie department of a national
bank look like a spoonful of brass fil-
ings then came the beginning of their
grief

  instead of remaining meek and lowly
as befits those upon whom blind fortune
has become unduly smitten as their bank
rolls swelled and grew rivalry and jeal-
ousy sprang up in their bosoms rank as
fungus in a swamp there came a time
when the mere sight of one another
curdled the last drop of the milk of
human kindness in their bosoms and
clogged their veins with hate and loath-
ing then one day they met and fought

  it was an uncanny exhibition of hate




 he red book magazine

and incompetence filled with weird

swipes and swopes and picturesque pos
ings while the adjectives they used
smelled as if they had leeu taken from
a dead language a sulphurous cloud of
dust hung over the battle-ground as if a
dynamite factory had suddenly become
a nervous wreck and gone into convul-
sions and it was only now and then lhai
the awe-stricken residents of red dog
could catch a fleeting glimpse of dim sil-
houetty figures prancing around in the
midst of the murk like indian ghosts
war-dancing in a fog-bank the noise
sounded like a ton of coal falling on a
tin roof mid to a man the rest of the
population of the town turned tail and
crawled under whatever came handiest
it was aw ful

  at the end of five minutes the worst of
it was over and with bated breaths the
red dogites crawled forth to inspect the
carnage they hadnt expected to find
anything left of the battle-ground but a
hole in the earth flanked by a few minor
disjointed fragments of human verta-
brie so you can imagine their disgust
when they saw how they had been bun-
coed the hole in the earth was absent
and the carnage consisted of the utter
destruction of two suits of raiment
while in the midst of the litter too weak
even to swear except in simple sentences
peck and wash jay glaring into each
others eyes in breathless impotence

  vet it was a time for prompt action
for already sun-bonnets were appearing
in the distance and the male population
of red dog met the emergency nobly
moved by a common impulse they
merged themselves around the gladia-
tors and bore them into pinto charleys
thirst-parlor and pulled down the cur-
tains that was the first time in the brief
but strenuous history of red dog that a
saloon had pulled down a shutter for
anything or anybody so the act in itself
marked an epoch then they locked the
door and plugged the keyhole while pin-
to went on a still hunt for first-aid gar-
ments for the sorely needful

  after awhile he came back and laid
the result of his search before them it
consisted of half a dozen yellow illus-
trated sporting-papers and out of them

they constructed a trousseau for peck
away that was little short of a creation
then they opened the back door and re
greifully but firmly shoved him uut into
the alley

  lie was a garish spectacle as he stood
there in the gloaming the paper that
formed his breastplate bore a life-size
picture of a game-chicken challenging
the universe while on his back was a
full length reproduction of a dancing
lady who balanced herself daintily with
one toe resting on his lumbar-region his
legs were a glittering medley of snake-
charmers bull-dogs and living-skeletons
he caught one glance of himself in the
mirror through the open door and then
went whizzing into the distance

  then the crowd turned sympathetical-
ly to wash but the visible supply oi
gents furnishing goods had vanished
with peckaway so they had to head him
up in an empty barrel and roll him
home that way the feud may now be
said to have reached the acute stage

  among other things it had come to
pass that wash was the father of a
daughter she was fifteen years of age
freckle-spattered and gum destroying
and the very day following the above
tragedy he assembled her in the from
corral of his residence and began to hold
heart to heart communion with her

  said wash

  daughter up to date you have never
been entered in the society hurdles but
now you have got to learn to be a
thoroughbred and a high-stepper al-
most imperceptibly i have come to no-
tice that you have not been thoroughly
broken to drawing-room manners and 
fear also that you are impairing your
maidenly form by riding bucking bron-
chos  la natural now the scenario of
this performance reads about as follows

  ive saved up enough gold dust to
stuff an elephants hide and im going
to squander it like a death valley pro-
moter in my duty towards you as a fond
parent ive arranged by telegraph to
grub stake and outfit you for three or
four years at an effete eastern seminary
where they have a coat of arms and a
guaranteed scandal every fortnight and
im going to picket you out there wherr
wedding chimes at red dol



the fodder is rich until you round into
perfect form in other words you have
got to become the similie for a true lady
that done the subsequent proceedings
will not be unlike the following

  as everybody knows i whaled old
peckaway into a grotesque caricature of
a man yesterday and i want you as a
dutiful daughter to make his degrada-
tion absolute therefore after you have
been moulded into a society-queen you
will suddenly some day go glittering
down our streets in
your low-neck gown
and aigrette and
flaunt your refined
manners and perfect
breeding under the
noses of old strong
and that unbranded
siwash son of his

edmund of course

edmund will fall
desperately in love
with you when you
have encouraged
him into the blind
staggers you will
gently kick his feel
out from under him
and throw him down
so hard that he will
echo the sympa
thetic shock will
either wreck the
remnant of old
peckaways reason
or drive him to his
grave in shame and
humiliation which
will serve him right
for trying to pose as my equal every-
thing is arranged and all you have to do
is get your pack ready and flag that
mixed freight in the morning

  so wash went to bed that night feel-
ing better natured than he had for a year
past and chuckled through long dreams
wherein he poked peckaway with a sharp
stick through the bars of a lunatic-asv-
lum

  but was he destined to do so listen

  twenty-four hours after the mixed
freight had borne gladys rideout over
the horizon peckaway dragged edmund

out of the lucky strike pool-room by his
ears and turned his vocabulary loose up
on him

  said peckaway

  son hearken as all the world
knows i mauled old rideout out of the
least semblance of humanity the other
day and i am told that the awful humil-
iation of it is unsettling his reason in
fact so morbid has he become that he
has shipped that unspeakable daughter
of his away by freight to some cheap
boarding-school
where his shame will
not kill her and
that has given me an
idea that would only-
come to genius

  for twenty years
ive been pecking
away at the pachy-
dermic cuticle of
this here earth as i
gathered the red cor-
puscles from its
veins in order that
my posterity might
browse on patty-de-
foi-grass and have
their clothes built
according to plans
and specifications
and while of course
i expect to make you
my dissolute heir
von have first got to
earn your patrimony
what you have got
to do now is to go
down east to some
big college where
they have good trainers and rubbers
and get yourself curried into an imita-
tion of a gentleman what would deceive
anybody also you have got to take some
kind of a degree i dont care whether
it is a dd an md or an lld so
long as it has capital letters and periods
in it-and the more of them the better
then i want you to come back here
with courtly manners and your trousers
pressed and break the heart of old ride-
outs female progeny

  i dont cherish anything in particular
against her except her looks and man-

aers and ancestry but when wash gazes
on her after the smash-up he will real-
ize what happens to upstarts of obscure
lineage and depraved instincts when
they try to break into the social environ-
ment of hereditary aristocracy incident-
ally he will probably waste away to a
shadow or commit suicide which will be
unfortunate for him but none of my
lookout so away you go first thing in
the morning

  so it came about that peckaway in his
turn rolled into bed that night soothed
and restful and for the next four years
he and wash glared down at each other
with scorn unspeakable as the plot sim-
mered and thickened it was at this stage
of the affair that alfalfa red and i got
under the limelight

  the three of us were camped one night
about half a dozen miles from red iog
where the trail branched off
towards benedict four miles
farther on things that we
had not been looking for had
been coming our way fasi
during the last ten days and
we were tired out and dis
consolate

  first it had been an itin
erant committee of the whole
from the moral suasion as-
sociation for the uplifting
of the unregenerate by phys-
ical means and they had
carried the physical means
looped upon their saddles

next a vagrant band of cav-
alry had sought our creden-
tials and it had been a long
stern chase yet this night
we had scarcely banked our
fire and rolled ourselves in
our saddle-blankets than the
chug of horses hoofs fell
upon our ears and brought us to our feet
fretful and peevish thirty seconds later
a couple of riders came galloping out of
the gloom and at the sight of our smol
dering fire pulled up and sat motionless
in their saddles as they looked into the
muzzles of our unmasked batteries

  they were a man and a woman and
as a tongue of flame licked up the sur-

rounding darkness we could see their
features just as if they had been cut
cameo he was a big young fellow this
man a good two yards in the perpendic-
ular and a yard in the horizontal across
the shoulders straight square-set and
happy-go-lucky looking as for the girl
-well just you call up the reddest
lipped roundest cheeked shiningesi
haired queen you ever dreamed of and
imagine her in a long riding-coat and
a cap under which shone eyes that
sparkled like dew on bunch-grass
whew but it was enough to make any
mans hair pull to look at a woman like
that way out there in the very solar-
plexus of that rim rock and cactus be-
jeweled eden and no wonder that at
first glance alfalfa began curling his
mustache and that red glued his fore-
lock over his forehead and twisted and
smirked idiotically our truns vanished

quicker than we had ever pulled them
and the young fellows mouth split an
inch wider

  evening boys better take care of
yourselves sleeping out here with the
gate open he said through his grin

  not a word did the queen say she
just sat there and smiled no use of a
woman doing anything else when she ran

smile like that it showed the tips of a
lot of ivory-white teeth and dimpled her
cheeks and turned us weak from heart
palpitation as three chinamen after a
smokefest we all mumbled something

  fact is he went on in the same
free and easy way this lady and myself
are somewhat perturbed finding our-
selves of a sudden in a situation wherein
we would not disdain assistance now
you fellows are strangers to me and the
first question is whether you would be
willing to come to the assistance of this
lady in our emergency if you are willing
to speculate unsight and unseen ill let
you in on the ground floor of our secret
if not speak up real loud and distinct
and well bid you ad ids and no harm
done so now which is it

  red straightened up on his toes and
began to bristle and grow hoarse he
made me think of a ten pound rat-terrier
trying to out-bluff a mastiff but even at
that if  hadnt known him i would
have got behind something at the mere
sound of him

  im with you and you are safe he
rumbled so whats the particular
brand of your trouble

  the man turned upon him

  its like this my name is strong-
lineal descendent of peckaway of that
name this lady is miss rideout and
she is the daughter of washington ride-
out popularly and vulgarly known as
wash and whose reputation may pos-
sibly have percolated thus far into the
foothills

  he stopped speaking and cocked his
ear over his shoulder and in that in-
stant my memory cleared i had seen
both strong and rideout way back in
the mildewed past and now as the cob-
webs of time fell away i saw their faces
plainly with my minds eye there could
be no doubt about it these full blooded
curried and groomed fly-by-nights were
their son and daughter for i could see
the family resemblances standing out
like the eagle on a gold piece but the
difference was this the ones before us
were young and fresh-tinted and full of
rich life like a new oil painting whereas
wash and peck were but a couple of poor
old battered tin-types

  the young fellow turned upon us
again

  the fact is you are now gazing upon
a man and woman who are soul-bent up-
on committing the heinous crime of mat-
rimony with malice aforethought and
consequences be hanged and that too
in the very teeth of our parents stern in-
junction for unreal as it may seem
while they encouraged us during our
preliminary love-jockeyings yet when
the lady and myself took the bits in our
teeth for the hurdle of matrimony they
arose frothing at the mouth and swearing
that they had been double-crossed and
whip-sawed neither could we pacify
them for both seemed to feel that child-
murder would be but an inconsequential
misdemeanor compared with such a mes-
alliance as our marriage then came the
open rupture and our present sprint for
the altar

  now of course our parents are a
couple of fine old boys in their way but
they are of the vintage of  and have
soured some they have never seen a
ninety horse-power motor-car on the
rampage and they dont realize that
when one comes along pack-mules have
got to take to the timber or get muti-
lated and on the same principle they
dont seem to comprehend that a ninety
horse-power car is but a baby-carriage
beside cupids chariot when the latter
vehicle comes amuck down the highway
now i dont want to be compelled to
take physical liberties with their anatom-
ical structures but im going to pull off
this wedding as per schedule or tear up
considerable natural scenery hence t
make this appeal to you on behalf of this
lady who deplores bloodshed incident-
ally i might mention that our pursuers
are probably raging not over a mile be-
hind us

  red began to bloat

  its a shame and an outrage and i
wont stand for it he gritted just let
me at the old griffins

  he dropped his hand on his holster
but strong stopped him with a gesture

  none of that the help i need is not
brute-force but strategy and diplomacy
alfalfa slid in front of red and rnnd
smirking before the queen
rhk red book magazlnfc

  diplomacy is my long suit and strat-
egy my pastime he began with a sim-
per presidents have attended my
night-school of statesmanship and i still
teach ambassadors strategy by corre-
spondence now if you will but give me
the mere inkling of what you would like
to have done the arranging of details
will be a mere mechanical function

  strongs head had been turned back-
ward again and now he whirled upon us
with his words pelting our ears like hail-
stones

  hear that if they are not on this
spot within three minutes ill eat a cac-
tus now listen hard

  you man pointing to alfalfa are
about my height and with my hat on at
fifty yards distance would be a passable
counterfeit of me in the moonlight
while you aiming his linger at red in
this ladys coat and cap and riding with
your knee around the horn might well
humbug a pair of hate-blinded eyes to
almost within arms length when we
have made the alteration in our apparel
and you are streaking it across the flat
and making your get-a-way from peck-
away and outriding rideout the lady and
i will be hitting it up along the trail
which ends in the box-canon of matri-
mony at benedict this other friend of
ours meaning me will be the stool-
pigeon and steerer

  when our pursuers come along he
will point out you two flitting away in
the shimmer and of course they will go
swooping away after you like a hawk aft-
er a june-bug the result is a foregone
conclusion  our horses are fresh and
the pursuit will be a hollow mockery
after you have inveigled them hopefully
along for a few miles all you will have
to do will be to use your spurs and sud-
denly leave them friendless and alone in
the midst of the howling wilderness
after that it will be up to them to turn
around and wander homeward grievous-
ly disappointed it is true but with none
of their vital organs missing

  to-morrow i will send them a certi-
fied copy of the wedding-certificate and
sometime thereafter the then mrs
strong and i will appear before them
penitent and remorseful but neverthe-

less solidly married then after they
have gone into an eruption boiled over
and cooled oft a lew thousand degrees i
will miss my guess if they dont kill the
fatted calf like a pair ol ame losers so
quick now

  sixty seconds later and they were gone
down the branch trail while red in the
cap and flowing coat and looking coy
and bewitching was ogling me with
coquettish glances as he sat with one
knee crooked around the horn then side
by side he and alf loped into the open

  i rolled a cigaret and stood motionless
and calmly expectant while portentous
events bore rapidly down upon me a
minute later two riders popped out of
the darkness and at sight of me stand-
ing there they arose in their stirrups and
with one pull stood their cayuses upon
their hocks like a couple of jackrabbits
they were peckaway and wash all
right but they had forgotten me as com
pletely as they had the ten command
ments for an instant they gazed
suspiciously then wash fractured the si-
lence

  stranger said he cold and cutting
have you happened to observe a moon
eyed goat-browed depraved featured
male monstrosity upon a bay horse whiz-
zing this way alongside of a perverse
looking weak-minded woman

  peckaway couldnt speak he just
choked up with language that gave him
the heart-burn and sat there glaring and
futile i threw the butt of my cigaret
away and sneaked a glance in the direc-
tion red and alfalfa had taken they
were a quarter of a mile away by this
time and in the moonlight the illusion
was a thing to gloat over

  that them i asked jerking my
thumb over my shoulder seem to be go-
ing somewhere dont they any little
thing i can do for you

  well you ought to have seen those two
old parties peckaway began to pant like
a donkey-engine and washs breath
sounded like a blizzard whistling through
a key-hole one look of hatred flared up
in their eyes and then they jabbed their
spurs to the hilt i made a flying leap on-
to my pony and was after them so clos
wedding chimes at red dog

he gravel from then hoofs pelted me
like buckshot in case they should man-
age to catch a if and red  knew there
would be scenes full of weird interest so
i hung onto their horses tails like the
vitcli behind tam oshanter

  w e split the moonlight like a torpedo-
boat splits the foam and left our shad-
ows panting and discouraged in the dis-
tance in front of me peckaway and
wash were quirting and gouging and
it every iump they emitted remarks that

foot made a bulls eye in a prairie-dog
hole and the way red went through the
atmosphere would have made a pinwheel
dizzy

  my girl i gasped wash as red was
still spinning heavens it will kill her

  but the next instant he let out a
screech of joy and amazement for the
flying creature before us lit  the horse
again like a circus-lady and turning in
the saddle wafted us a kiss from its fin
sjers with nonchalant elegance but ni

m with you art oti ta   iumo

wade my hair bristle and set my teeth 
-dge like a lemon a quarter of a mile
liiead we could see the fugitives gliding
ver the flat like a pair of stampeded
ghosts red all in a flutter of flowing
coat and alf looming up tall and
straight as he rode with one hand resting
on his companions shoulder in an atti-
tude of lover-like fidelity and encourage-
ment the way wash gritted his teeth at
the sight reminded me of a quartz-
crusher

and then in a twinkling i saw some-
hinu happen cheyennes horse with one

ten seconds more elapsed before the a
pect of things began to alter materially
reds horse had begun to limp and grad-
ually he and alf were compelled to slow
down to a mere canter seeing this peck-
away and wash began to ride as if in-
sane

  over the mountain-tops a black cloud
had come crawling and now when we
were within a stones throw of the runa-
ways it snuffed out the moon as if some-
body had rolled it up in a blanket for
a minute or two more we hurtled on
blindly until we were all riding in a
the red book magazine

jostling bunch with no one knowing his
next neighbor then i drew sharply

back with a presentiment strong upon
me that something eventful was about to
happen and hardly had i done so when
it happened

  from in front of me came a yelp of
fear close echoed by a wild chorus of
yells and a wallowing splash from out
of the murk came sounds of choking and
clawing as if an army of wild cats were
lighting on a mud bank leaving me sit-
ting inert and wondering and unable to
do more than extend my sympathy then
there came floating through the darkness
the voice of wash and it was earnest
and pleading

  suffering snakes gladys let go of
my whiskers and ill surrender  sent
you to a seminary to learn delsarte and
ladylike deportment and they have
turned you out a gneco-roman wrest-
ler

  and hardly had wash finished his wail
than peckaways tones came to me preg-
nant with emotion

  unhand my ear-flaps edmund and
go take your lady you have pounded my
head against that rock until i fear the
poor thing is fractured

  for a moment following all was si-
lence and suspense then the cloud
whipped itself from in front of the
moon and i gazed down upon them

  red was sitting astride of wash at the
bottom of a water-hole both hands
buried in his whiskers while alfalfa
had peckaway by the ears and was
stretching them like rubber as he kneaded
his anatomy both wash and peck were
still struggling weakly but as the bright
moonlight fell on the faces above them
their arms dropped limply and they lay
petrified in amazement

  and all the while i thought you were
gladys groaned wash wild eyed
gladys with the biceps of a gymnast
and the grip of a bear-trap who in the
hozanna are you anyway

  who am i grittedred ill tell
you im a knight of the old school and
the chosen champion of your daughter
and you had better savvy this old par
ty when cheyenne red takes up his
lance in behalf of the fair sex its time

for old land-crabs like you to burrow
and right now while i am upon that
subject i want to ask you a question
do you hereby consent to your daughters
union with her affinity edmund or shall
 proceed with the obsequies

  he took another hitch of the whiskers
around his hand and braced himself for
an effort but washs voice arose quickly

  in the name of humanity have mercy
unloose my whiskers and take her my
blessing

  red loosened up a trifle and faced al-
falfa

  is your old victim agreeable he
questioned

  alf nodded

  hes as tame as a house-cat and as
gentle as a pet ewe i guess we might as
well postpone the death scene he an-
swered

  so they got on their feet and stood
erect in the moonlight smeared with
mud and victory

  we all mounted and plodded along
the back route at the place where the
trail divided i addressed them

  inasmuch as you two parents have
consented to the union and seeing that
it is only five miles to benedict why not
ride over and give the young people a
send off

  nobody objected so in half an hour
we were in town

  instead of finding the runaways safely
double-harnessed as we had expected
we located them moping on a bench in
front of the cattlemans palace wan
faced and disconsolate as we came in
sight young strong jumped to his feet
and began to bristle but when i had
briefly explained matters he grinned a
bit and thrust out his hand wash took ii
as if he feared it was red hot

  married i suppose he grunted with
a sour smile well i guess it is too late
to thwart it

  but edmunds head only shook regret-
fully

  what yelled wash hopping in the
air like a cricket do you mean to tell
me you have run away with my girl and
not married her you homed toad ill
shoot you
wedding chimes at red dog



  in an instant gladys had thrust her-
self between them

   it isnt his fault daddy you see the
only justice of the peace here is down
with the hydrophobia and the clerk of
the court has taken advantage of the sit-
uation to elope with the justices wife so
we couldnt even get a license let alone
get married

  wash struck the earth again and
shoved his gun back to place and as he
did so inspiration again hit me

  mr strong i believe you are also a
justice i ventured suavely

  he nodded

  and you mr rideout are deputy-
clerk of the court of this county

  he knew better than deny it so i
continued comforting as soothing syrup

  the solution of the problem is rudi-
mentally simple mr rideout deals out
the marriage-license and mr strong
pulls off the solemn ceremony alf here
is the proud best-man red in his flowing
coat the blushing bridesmaid and i the
competent witness

  both red and alf became clamorous
with enthusiasm but the other two only
looked gloomy

  i havent any license-forms with me
except gambling-licenses grumbled
wash fumbling in his pockets

   i settled that difficulty instanter

   aint marriage a gamble just fill out
one of them to suit the case and see how
it reads

 so we all went into the palace and
borrowed the inkwell and went to work
on that license when we had finished it
was in words and figures just about as
follows

   permission is hereby granted under
  the laws of the state of nevada for
  edmund strong and gladys rideout
  partners to operate the game of chance
  called matrimony until this license is
  canceled conditioned only that the said
  game be operated upon the dead level by
  both parties all crooked dealing foul
  play and four-flushing strictly prohib-
  ited house rules to govern

    signed

             washington rideout

    deputy clerk of the court coyote co

  we all stood up in the little office
while judge strong threw the diamond-
l-i itch over them and cinched it and then
blessed them with a voice that rattled
like a dice-box the light from the one
kerosene-lamp flickered over them and
made a picture that i wish could be
painted

 edmund had ceased grinning and
looked medium serious but i noticed he
still kept his arm around her shortest cir-
cumference as for gladys well she
was smiling and crying at the same time
like mixed rain and sunshine and ill be
hanged if old wash wasnt snuffling
around like a cub lear that has lost its
mother no sooner were the proceedings
over however than he goes digging and
fishing down in his pocket scowling all

two pnck-mul with ball on them


he red book magazine

the time and eventually digs up a lop-
eared check-book

  i suppose everything is all set now
except the marriage receipt he grum-
bled picking up the pen as if it had been
a pick-handle havent any regular
forms for that either but everything
seems to go this unnatural evening

  so he scribbled out the certificate on
the back of the check wherein and
whereby he served warning on all men
by these presents that the within named
had been duly spliced under him as fore-
man and daring anybody to deny it then
the rest of us put our aliases on it and
wash reached for it again and did some
more thoughtful writing on the reverse

side and when he had finished that cer
tificate was good at any bank in nevada
for ten thousand dollars neither was
that the meanest thing he ever did in his
hectic life

  there was a railroad-station three
miles further on and mr and mrs
strong were panting with impatience to
catch the first train and get to some town
where they could outfit for a little dash
over to europe so we all rode over with
them

  just outside the town we fell in with
a prospector who was getting an early
start into the mountains and he had two
pack-mules with bells on them so we
had wedding-chimes all the way over

qenevieve whiting wearily
shook her head i cant do it bil-
ly she said please dont ask me any-
more

  billy prior started for the door once
he reached it however he paused
turned suddenly and came back

  why

  that was what he had asked himself
too often now he was asking her well
thunder so he told himself he had a
right to

  im a game quitter genevieve he
assured her but there must be a reason
and ive got to know it see

  genevieve backed into a corner and
still shook her head

  is there somebody else persisted
prior

  genevieve smiled no she an-
swered you know that who could there
be

  prior gloomily seated himself upon a
straight-backed chair

  im right here until i know he an-
nounced

  genevieve hesitated for an instant
then she crept softly into a chair facing
him and glanced squarely into his eyes

  i guess youve got a right to know
billy she finally assented and im go-
ing to tell you

  tell me

  the girl drew a long breath its be-
cause i love you-too much she finally
conceded

  billy prior rose and sprang toward
her his arms outstretched despair
dropped from his face and hope-no
certainty stood there in its stead

  genevieve he cried

  but the girl merely drew back into her
corner once more and once more shook
her head

  you dont understand billy she
went on and i must make you under-
stand i love you too much to marry
you

  too much to marry me repeated
prior

  she nodded briskly love isnt enough
for me or for you either billy i must
i he real-estate lady



admire the man i marry if i cant 
-hall not be happy and my unhappiness
is going to drag him down

  and you cant admire me can you
sighed billy prior he laughed well
i dont blame you he admitted

  if  could make you understand the
girl answered him if i could only make
you see things as i see them youre a
failure billy prior now ive said it
and i mean it and yet you dont under-
stand

  will you put yourself in my place
just for once she went on my father
-hes the man ive lived with all my
life hes a failure billy-a dismal fail-
ure oh how sick at heart it makes me
yes i love him but i cant admire him
i can hardly respect him hes good and
hes good to me but you cant under-
stand he hasnt got what  demand in
men he hasnt got success and-the
whole thing taints my love for him

  prior had turned pale genevieve he
said listen to me if you love me come
with me i know that im thirty-two
years old i know that im barely scrap-
ing together twelve hundred a year but
what of it  let us start in two rooms let
us-dont sacrifice the happiness of two
people like this

  genevieve stopped him it is just
what i am not going to do she answered
i am not going to sacrifice our happi-
ness oh she burst forth cant you un-
derstand what do i care about the
money part of it i could live in a hovel
with the man who had-who had accom-
plished things  who had once by his own
efforts been somebody if you had twelve
thousand a year i wouldnt marry you-
unless that twelve thousand stood for
something in your blood something that
i am looking for in men-success you
dont know me billy im starving for
the thing ive never had my grand-
fathers my father my uncles-look at
them think of them shambling fail-
ures  ive watched you billy hoping
against hope

  something belligerent mingled with
the confused expressions upon billys
face

  do you really understand what youre
talking about he queried dont you

know theres nothing in success but luck 
dont you believe there may have been
ten or a hundred abraham lincolns who
never had the chance to take first place
dont you believe there are a thousand
theodore roosevelts actually starving in
obscurity to-day who were they placed
in his high place would do what he does
would be what he is dont you

  she smiled sadly luck she re-
peated her lip curled it was the food
her father had fed her luck every
successful man was merely a lucky
man he had married a rich wife he had
had a rich father somebody had left
him a fortune he had a political pull
there was always some explanation and
its name was-luck it sickened her

  its no use billy she went on you
even have the patter of the unsuccessful
man luck why to me theres no such
thing as luck ive read about successful
men and i can put my finger upon their
every move and show you how they cre-
ated opportunity themselves look at me
cant you see how i feel  cant you see
i am not sordid i dont crave wealth or
position or ease but billy im going to
be very frank im going to be unwom-
anly  i do want a man i want to marry
a man in whose veins runs the thing im
looking for-success if he doesnt find
me if i dont find him then i cant
marry anybody else if i should then the
man id marry would be unliappier than
t

  she held forth her hand

  billy she went on very softly i
like you too much to make you unhappy
by marrying you

  lets take a chance genevieve
pleaded prior if we marry i know its
going to make a difference i know our
luck will change

  luck there it was again yes billy
was hopeless he belonged to the great
army of men who wait forever for some-
thing to turn up and she kept on shak-
ing-her head until she shook billy from
the door and billy went in despair
digging his nails into the palms of his
hands

  by george im going to marry her
he said aloud to himself at the corner of
the street if genevieve could have seen
the red book magazine

lus face just at that juncture she might
have changed her views of billy prior
im going to marry her he declared

  the girl had told the man the truth
she had lain bare her soul to him she
knew she was right she knew she was
justified she had lived with ciphers too
long her father-she shuddered when
she thought of him her father with his
old battered desk with a cheap desk-
room in a cheap old building on a side
street down-town with his name printed
on cardboard tacked to his desk alfred
j whiting real estate-insurance-
loans notary public commissioner of
deeds she recalled still shuddering
with what awe as a child she had real-
ized that her father was a commissioner
of deeds a notary public at the age of
fifteen she had discovered that a notary
got twelve cents for taking affidavits and
a commissioner twenty-five cents for ac-
knowledgments and that their respec-
tive duties usually ended there and her
childish respect had dropped from her
it had never come back she had soon
found out that real estate and insur-
ance and loans were quite as unim-
portant in their way and that her father
was the most unimportant thing about
the whole business

  poor father she would sigh but
without real tenderness poor hilly
prior she would add and her eyes
would slowly fill with tears oh if she
were only a man  she would show them
if she could go into business now and-

  she was a teacher in the bartlett ave-
nue school she earned seven hundred
and fifty dollars a year they told her
she was a success at teaching she felt
indeed that this was true and she knew
why she loved children she knew how
to handle children but teaching-it
would never do for her

  im a marrying woman she would
tell herself she was right she wanted to
marry she wanted to marry well and
she wanted to bring up children among
the forty children in her class she could
pick out about five whose mother she
would like to be the warrener kids
twins they were twins she laughed to
herself as she thought of it and her

heated face broke into color all at once
ihe warrener twins with their neat blue
and white linen and gingham and their
plump bare legs popping out of the big
red automobile in the morning and
scrambling into it again in the afternoon
and the little skinkle boy and maisie
wat ter son

  im a marrying woman she would
say again who will never marry she
would add

  why not she well knew because
there was nobody who wanted her save
billy prior and she would never marry
him

  you can marry anybody you want
to her fellow teachers told her envi-
ously enough  of course you can with
your eyes and your hair and your figure
and the way you talk why you can
twist em around your little linger
woman

  but she only shook her head mar-
riage is a lottery she told them its
all luck some of us marry and seme of
us dont thats all

  luck miss pope of the third room
who was engaged simply snickered
get busy girl she said they wont
come after you youve got to go after
them thats the difference between the
successful married women and the old-
maid failures the married women are
the ones who nab em as they pass thats
all

  genevieve shuddered once more she
vaguely wondered if they were right
wondered whether she might not be
tainted with this disease of failure  won-
dered in her soul whether real women
really did arrange these matters so that
-why she had never had anybody but
billy prior

  her father died and her father took
with him into his grave his daughters
love not her admiration not her gen-
uine respect nothing but love and pity
that were genuine enough in their way
but still were incomplete

  poor father that was all she could
say not great father not strong father
not well-known well-liked universally
respected father and he had left behind
only his daughter and the old battered
desk with its old cardboard sign tacked
i he real-estate lady

  

on-all that remained of the real es-
tate insurance and loan business the
notary public and the commissioner of
deeds was a thing of the past her father
had lived his life had married a woman
who had died and he had left behind
him nothing save his daughter - no
name no memory to her it was awful
somehow and again she would clench
her hand and smite the window-ledge

  if i were a man and then of a
sudden it came to her the idea she
would be a man  she would never marry
for there was nobody but billy and she
was too much of a woman to do what her
fellow teachers had suggested somehow
she couldnt nab em

  but ill show em she told herself

  her father had left a thousand dollars
of life-insurance money she had paid
most of the premiums to her this thou-
sand dollars stood for something it was
a sign it spelled opportunity it was
a command to do things she proceeded
to do them she had her fathers old desk
sent up to her flat she had it chopped
up and burned along with its useless
burden of pigeonholed papers failure
was dead and out of the way now for
good her course was clear

  ill be a man she announced to her-
self a rel-estate man

  she was as good as her word she hired
a room-not a desk-room-down in the
lawyers building and installed a new
desk and some new chairs and had g
whiting put in gold letters on the door
she shook her femininity from her she
tacked up a motto or two in her desk
do it now do the hardest
thing first and she added a home-
made one of her own theres no
such thing as luck

  her motives were varied and still they
were unique she had to wipe the stain
of failure from the name of whiting
she had to found a new dynasty of suc-
cess she wanted to prove someway that
she knew how she wanted to forget too
that she was a marrying woman she
couldnt have those warrener twins un-
der her nose every day without thinking
and above all she wanted to show billy
prior that she was right and that he was

wrong she was there to sieze opportun-
ity by the forelock with a grip that was
the grip of death itself

  now she exclaimed with the same
gusto one at gravesend might cry
theyre off

  she sat and waited then she adver-
tised a bit then she sat and waited some
more then she advertised again busi-
ness came creeping in she took charge
of collecting the rents of three houses
whose annual income was  for the
three her commission was  per an-
num for that service she sat and waited
but she was not idle like the failures
not at all she began to understand the
real-estate business in all its length and
breadth

  i must get my cash to work she as-
sured herself she still had five hundred
dollars her trick was to speculate on
her own behalf not merely to get com-
missions for other peoples sales to buy
and sell herself to get her own profits
and to keep them to buy at low prices
and sell at high prices that was the
trick to deal in equities that was the
great game in which the fittest were sure
to survive she haunted sheriffs-sales
and foreclosure-sacrifices she scanned
the papers for business-troubles

  going at five hundred and twenty-
five the sheriff cried five hundred and
twenty-five this new double-decker
apartment-house all improvements near
the trolley-five hundred and twenty-
five-

  genevieve paused for an instant she
did nothing in a hurry there were a
dozen real-estate men about the room
billy prior was one of them he had
been bidding insistently but he had
dropped out at four seventy-five some-
body else was bidding against gene-
vieve  it was somebody who wanted the
apartment-house unquestionably gene-
vieve smiled to herself yes billy was a
quitter it was the people who stayed in
the game who won out after all

  going at five twenty-five exclaimed
the sheriff

  five fifty whispered genevieve

  there was a deep silence somebody
nodded to the sheriff the sheriff asked
for other bids there were none gene-
 

i he red book magazine

vieve hushed with pride the equity was

hers-hers

gone at five hundred and fifty to g

whiting said the sheriff

  prior came over to shake hands with
genevieve

  you dropped out said genevieve

  prior nodded if i could have had it
at four fifty he said  knew where j
could dispose of it at a hundred dollars
profit

  a hundred gasped genevieve
why im expecting to make half a thou
sand on this deal

  phew whistled prior but you
have luck

  thats what you call it hilly she
returned

  she flushed with satisfaction she was
a real-estate woman in dead earnest now
she owned an equity she was speculat-
ing and she knew and billy prior had
gone up there and done all that bidding
just because he thought he might make
fifty or a hundred dollars and his nerve
had forsaken him

  after six months hard work gene-
vieve unloaded her bargain at a profit of
rwenty-three dollars and fifty cents
things had gone wrong somehow

  it was one of harringtons new
houses you know other real-estate men
told her and you know harrington
squeezes em dry before they leave his
hands steer clear of harrington you
were lucky to get out whole

  such darned luck she thought to
herself

   but it was all right it was experience
and she had sold the house to billy
prior that was one satisfaction if har-
rington had stuck her why she had-
well not stuck billy but billy was a
fool for buying such an elephant

  gee billy informed her after eighi
more months it took work i tell you
for me to sell that place again only
made five hundred on it too it kept me
awake nights i can tell you

  genevieve investigated and-wilted
yes billy had made the half thousand
all right why hadnt she held on but
she was through with new houses her
eyes were wide open new houses were
built to sell but old ones werent peo-

ple wanted new houses nobody wanted
old houses genevieve went personally
into good neighborhoods respectable side
streets where property was worth fifty
dollars a foot and picked out the most
disreputable looking shanties she could
find she selected the big roomy houses
that needed shingling and re-painting
and plumbing she bought one the worsi
of the lut by its appearance and pul a
carpenter and a plumber and a painter
at work upon it inside of two months it
looked new genevieve sold it at once
and made four hundred and thirty-five
dollars on it-a quick turn one week
after she had received the money her
purchaser called on her

   i aint no kicker he complained but
youve sold me a gold brick all o k
look at this here he exhibited a piece
of clapboard covered with new paint
but rotten as cheese theyre all the
same he said i aint no kicker he as-
sured her

  he looked at her curiously and at hej
sign

  whiting  he mused you aint a girl
of old a whitings are you no you
dont say well your old pop wouldnt
have turned a trick like that he was as
honest as the day was long

  it was like a dash of cold watei in the
girls face

  honest her father yes of course
he had been honest so was she honest
she had bought the house on the same
chance as had her purchaser but still
that coat of paint was like charity it
covered a multitude of sins but she
knew the business-caveat emptor-let
the buyer beware

  im sorry she began id like to
take it back but business is business

  i dont want you to take it back
grumbled the purchaser i just sold it
for five hundred profit myself i could v
made eight hundred if these clapboards
hadnt been rotten as mud you see
genevieve bit her lip with vexation
why hadnt she made all that profit in
stead of letting him do it what was the
matter it seemed as if luck were againsi
her she had been in the business for two
and a half years and she hadnt made
more than about nine dollars a weet
eht keal-estate lady



but of course it all took time and grit
would tell

  she kept on buying old houses foi
there really was good money in that line
she had no losses until finally she tack
led the huge double crater house on
jefferson street it was a big thing and
it looked good but it threatened to
swamp her she held on to it like grim
death for six months then billy prior
-poor old honest billy he was just
pegging along-he helped her out took
it off her hands and she cleaned up even
barring loss of time and interest on her
money but she couldnt sympathize with
billy  it wasnt businesslike in him to do
it even for friendship she called him up
one day and asked him how he was get-
ting along with the big house

  i cleaned a thousand on it billy
told her a thousand how well you
see billy explained over the phone
lumber and labor leaped up about thir-
ty-three per-cent the week i bought it
from you and-well theres good lum-
ber in that house you know and its
properly put together yes im much
obliged to you

  she rang off hastily she saw she had
read in the papers long ago about lum
ber and about labor and all that she had
had to do wras to hold on she was ter
ribly unlucky somehow

   she was glad to see though that hilly
was not forging ahead he was a queer
chap always talking about his town the
beauty of the town and what the town
ought to do-always he was too publir
spirited a sort of crank it seemed to
genevieve she liked a pretty town too
but it didnt seem to have much to do
with success after all but billy kept pot-
tering on and pottering on and pretty
soon he had made some headway after
writing letters to the papers a big public
park athletic grounds a brook running
through it all that sort of thing thal
was what he stood for ihe newspapers
began slowly to take up the idea the
town had small parks but this was some
thing different the schools took it up 
rhe people talked about it

  t guess billy said one day to gen-
evieve were going to have that park
after all tf we do itll be the biggest

thing weve ever had after that well
wake up new county buildings  new
city buildings but the park first

  genevieve smiled grimly if we get
the park itll be vou who started it wont
it

  prior flushed well he admitted
eyeing the fringe on his trousers i have
pushed it along all i could

  what did it amount to he had had
his name in the paper once or twice
thats all and there was fringe on his
trousers and he was over thirty-five
years old

  finally the board of aldermen came
out flat-footed we shall have the park
that was final and conclusive but
what of it billy priors name was not
even mentioned he had been lost in the
shuffleharrington and one or two other
prominent citizens the superintendent of
schools and a millionaire or two were
quoted in the papers yes it was just like
them they were men of success and
genevieve noted how in this matter of
merely public interest these men came
forward with their shoulders squeezing
poor public-spirited billy prior into the
background out of sight poor billy and
his fringe

  then suddenlyit happened the whole
army of real-estate men and speculators
rushed with a wild whoop toward the
marshes at the eastern end of town two
miles awray why because that was the
logical site for the park

  option was the cry give me an
option hang it

  genevieve figuratively speaking also
rushed with the crowd she sniffed the
air this was real real-estate business
here clear grit would count not luck
but she too was shouldered out she
couldnt get a foothold she fell back
and was only glad to see that hilly prior
was in the rear ranks too
you he asked

  he shook his head dismally i havent
tried to get an option he announced
whats the use

  he wras right there was no use for
pease  wilmerding the big real-estate
agents who represented the owner of the
marshy grounds only shook their heads
and smiled


i he red buuk magazine

  not a foot of ground for sale they
said other agents fumed and swore
harrington who had been the first man
in the race fairly howled youve got
to give me some he clamored

  genevieve sat back and watched she
was disappointed fortunes could have
been made buying that marshy ground at
a low price and selling it to the city at a
high price for a park

  isnt there any way she pleaded
with pease  wilmerding

  they were as adamant none they
told her

  the clamor was hardly stilled when
the common council rose once more and
announced that the marshy tract had
been decided on

  just think genevieve said to billy
prior of the luck of the man who owns
that marshy tract luck where is my
luck every thing is luck it seems to
me

  billy prior smiled im not so sure
he said i think you changed my views
on that subject some years ago im not
so sure of luck

  and suddenly the papers printed a
name-prior-william prior who
was william prior why he was the
man who had started the clamor for a
park oh to be sure it had been passed
along and strengthened by men like har-
rington  priors feeble voice had only
been heard at the start but now it was
all prior for the city made the an-
nouncement that it had just purchased
william priors marshy tract of meadow-
land at the east end of town for the great
new public park did the papers sneer
no why not

  because billy prior was a public ben-
efactor after all there was not a real-
estate man in town who would not
appraise billy priors meadows at two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for
park-purposes

  i shall give them to the town for one
hundred thousand dollars announced
prior

  and even harrington admitted that
there was more of a gift in it than there
was a sale for it turned out that prior
could have sold to speculators during

the big demand for at least half a mil
lion dollars but genevieve was stunned

  billy she exclaimed how did it
all happen

  billy prior looked down at the fringe
on his trousers-the town had not as yet
handed him his check

  oh i dont know he replied just
luck  bought that tract-the whole
thing-when i was twenty-three years
old for five hundred dollars i knr- its
time must come i knew the town w -uld
need it and it did i just held on  hats
all

  one hundred thousand from five
hundred she gasped and yet she
added you might have had a half mil-
lion billy suddenly she held out her
hand billy she exclaimed i-i ad-
mire you youre different from the rest
theyre sharks-harrington and his
crowd but you-you are more like fath-
er father he was honest he was de-
cent he was a man was father

  billy prior ceased regarding the
fringe

  genevieve he said somehow ive
made good its in me i know it now it
always was in me i think only i never
found myself until-until you showed
me how i want you to marry me when i
get my check

  genevieves eyes moistened she was
not thinking of the hundred thousand
she was thinking of her father she was
thinking of billy and what she thought
of him she was thinking of the warren-
er children with their linen suits she
looked into his eyes and she saw love
there love-love it was everything
she had seen too much of successful
men what was success  he smiled into
billys eyes

  i want to marry you now billy she
said softly before you get your check
-while the fringe is-is-still there

  the former miss pope recently of
the third year of the bartlett avenue
school passed the evening-paper across
the table to her husband

  well she nabbed her man all right
she remarked i always knew she would
and such luck  the one time miss pope
whispered the last

cver spin oakum asked buddle-
field as i lounged on the beach near
the overturned craft he was preparing to
make water-tight the deftness with
which the old salt rolled long strands
from the fluffy mass beside him proved
he was no novice

  sorry to say bud i have had no ex-
perience in that line or i would help
you

  ye neednt feel overly sorry he re-
joined the better a sailor-man spins
oakum the more ell bear watchin
how is that

  they puts short-term men mostly to
oakum spinnin the more times es been
sent up the smarter the workman eh
he paused in his labor for a moment
and cast a glance seaward a trim black
schooner was making for the harbor her
white bellying sails and spurt of foam at
the bow forming a picture buddlefield
evidently loved to gaze upon

  shes a flyer he observed

  a beauty i replied admiringly
who owns her

  that feller there

  buddlefield flirted his thumb toward a
chubby faced boy of four years or so
who with a toy shovel and tomato-can
was busying himself near us on the sand
the vessel was left to him eh
not e e made it all isself
hardly comprehending i looked at
the boy again he had wavy hair inclined
to red and large gray eyes freckles
showed through the grime on his snubby
nose a wholesome-looking little chap that
any child-lover would take to he had
kicked off his shoes one of which served
as a pail to transport water in  the other
he was using for a sand-cart

   es took a great shine to me said
buddlefield plays round ere most of

his time and i looks after im as i prom-
ised liza ann

  draw it milder bud how could a
child of his age make enough to buy a
vessel i interrupted

  young man theys things appenin
all the time out o the ordinary replied
buddlefield

  now as to that ere little red ead

   e left is ome when e war sixteen
months old-absconded ye might say-
and nobody knowd whar e went e
was gone a matter o three weeks and
come ome to is widdered mother with
twelve thousand two undred dollars to
is credit in a boston bank part o which
is inwested in that black schooner the
same bein named after im the billy
banks think it over young man in the
light o a wonderful example of infantile
henergy

  buddlefields gnarled hand moved
back and forth monotonously over the
shiny surface of his tarry overalls while
the amber strands of oakum coiled deeper
around his feet

  trooly a wonderful example of hen-
ergy he finally chuckled

  awaiting his humor i listlessly
watched the feathery lines which traced
the break of gentle waves along the
shore the black schooner moved grace-
fully from view beyond the breakwater
while its irresponsible owner sat near us
vigorously stirring the contents of his
can

  tell us about it bud i finally ven-
tured coaxingly give me the whole
story

  better not he replied  wouldnt
have ye change yer mind about me and
conclood im a liar

  oh bud bud t protested noth-

pened when i was mate on the nancy

credoolous now as to this ere he
nodded toward the boy

 pened liza ann bein busy thought no

 couraging pause

of a shipmate outside and took to the

the baby on

  a tender-earted man wras abe when

  after makin the baby comfortable
abe put for the ighway opin to see

by neighbors

   oh my baby ave you seen it in a

  buddlefield paused for a moment then
added thoughtfully ive allers eld that

ed go down and comfort liza ann  in
consequence of which she pore woman

  with that abe looks the baby over

  as the sun was settin abe looked
for a fittin place to ave supper e avin
plenty of bread and cheese in a bag

  jest then earin distant voices e re-
connoitered very cautious and saw two
men sittin by a bit o camp-fire and a
woman cookin a span o bony gray

ity then e pulled the jug from under
the wagon  eres to mrs duttin e
sez and er usband the man o grief

crawled from the bushes tords the fire
they looked the ground over careful
then turned attention to the wagon from
which proceeded eavy snorin the port-
land sheriff poked the flap aside and
peered in by the light o is bulls-eye
e saw a woman and a man sound asleep

track and abe conclooded to follow it

for distant shores afore ed got a mile
along the track e see a long trestle
bridge ahead of im and e oped e
wouldnt topple over with billy is ead

kindly old the baby and well see about

  the young woman took billy er
ands all trembly with fright while abe
picked up a cudgel and started for the
man then stopped and came back to the
women

  is name is billy e sez im is
father is mother is dead e kissed bil-
ly who smiled at im then walked away
fast e stopped to pick up the red shawl
from the dirt and toss it on the clean

the man grabbed im sudden with a and
at is throat and nigh broke abes neck
with the twist e gin im

  like a flash abe brought is club
down on the mans ead and over e top-

waters below

  the engineer ad seen it all and
slowed up stoppin within ten feet o the
spiked switch a crowed o passengers
swarmed out thankin eaven for its
marcy and shudderin when they looked
down into the quarry

  the crazy man shoutin and laugh-
n was pinted out by the woman carry-
in billy as the one who did it all in a
minute e was tied with ropes and put in

the engineer lookin back the crazy

  the young woman looked at the rush-
in waters far below the bridge oh es
drowned she sobbed an e left this
baby

   what said a undred voices and
they crowded around the woman

    e said the babys mother was
dead she told em

   dead poor orfin some o the more
tender-earted ad tears in their eyes
when they looked at billy who was kick-
in his legs and laughin earty

   my friends sez a stout man this

  then there war cheerin for billy
and in ten minutes e war worth moren
twelve thousand dollars in is own right
cause the thing war taken ot right in the
fever o gratitood

  then when a lawyer-man went to
take billy from the young woman billy
ung to er and she began to cry bein
tender-earted and avin knowd is fath-
er so to speak

  then the lawyer-man sez the train
is going eres my address and twenty
dollars bring the baby to me in boston
to-morrow or the day after

  so the train went off with cheers for
billy and as many women kissed im as
could get at im

  the young woman took billy to the
lawyer-man in boston as told

   young lady e sez ive been ap-
pinted guardeen of the baby and is
money beins the baby is used to you and
you appear to like im youll be allowed
fair wages and expenses for lookin after

  with that the young woman ugged
billy and e ugged er cause she sommat
favored liza ann in features and see-
in the uggin the lawyer said e wished

jolly and pleasant-like

   better take im back in the country
where the cows eat grass and give honest

  the young woman said she ad a sis-
ter as was married to a mackril-fisher on

for billy and pleasant for erself

an easter entanglement

by clarence herbert new

author of  courgo elc
illustrated by r j campbell

i i was getting to be late in the after-

	noonand burton was thoroughly tired
of having legal technicalities read to
him even more tired of affixing his sig-
nature to the various documents con-
nected with his investments lu fact
these visits at the office of the lawyer
who managed his affairs were always
more or less of a nuisance to him-got-
ten through with as quicklj as possible
-and he was about to leave when the
elderly attorney called his attention to a
letter which had been for the time over-
looked 

  its about that virginia mortgage
he said this came yesterday from the
colonel w ants to increase the amount a
couple of thousand-says he contem-
plates making some necessary improve-
ments upon his plantation and needs the
money

  well-no objection is there

  w hy-yes the fellow has managed
to pay his interest promptly enough-
but ive had inquiries made down there
and my correspondent says the place
wouldnt bring what he has already bor-
rowed on it even under favorable condi-
tions same old story you know last of
a colonial family going to seed-old
ideas - lack of push - too easy going
ever to make anything out of the place
keeps open house iust as he used to be-
fore the war-without a spare cent to
his name ive been thinking you ought
to foreclose without delay in order to
get anything at all out of it but were

  in luck it happens the tobacco com-
bine i gradually acquiring all the goodl
land it can get hold of and discovered 
represented the holder of the colonels -
mortgage so the people made me an of-
fer that is altogether too good to throw
away if youll drop in before the end of
the week ill have the papers drawn up
and youll come out a little ahead of the
game lucky i happened to think of it
before you got away

  hm-m-tn - i suppose my signature
would be necessary 

  why of course youve never given
me a power of attorney you know-and
the loan stands in your name down there
in dinwiddie count- but it wont take
five minutes to sign the transfer-theyll
do the recording themselves

  suppose i should happen to die-
would they be able to get hold of the
property then-easily

  you mean il your heirs still held it
why theyd have to authorize your exec-
utor to make the transfer if they areed
among themselves to sell out ive lever
drawn up a will for you that i remem-
ber and ive no idea how many heirs you
may have

  what i was getting at is the fact that
the tobacco people couldnt very well
get that particular piece of property if i
happened to care about holding on to the
mortgage but that a little anxiety about
the safety of my investment just at this
moment would be likely to throw it into
their hands without the owners having


an easter entanglement



much say in the the matter as you put
the case-considering your information
as to its value-my mortgage would hold
it even if the place were put up at auc-
tion is that right

  surely but im telling you i con-
sider it a mighty poor investment even
now i naturally thought you would tell
me to sell out at once but if you havent
confidence in my judgment-why-
the younger man had walked over to
the window and was looking down at
the ships in the bay in his mind there
was the vague suggestion of a face he
had once seen in
virginia while on
a brief visit to a
family of friends
-a pair of won-
drous dark eyes
under a mass of
soft black hair
red lips a witch-
ing dimple and
an accent that
lingered in his
memory though
he had seen the
girl but once and
could not recall
her name sup-
pose now that
these t o b a c c o
people had begun
to look with
greedy eyes upon
her home he
turned slowly
from the window
to the lawyer

  it isnt that at all graham it
wouldnt hurt me if i lost every cent ive
loaned on the place - and the point
which sticks in my crop is the selling
out an old home where the family may
have lived for generations whom did
you say the owner was

  colonel george campbell he com-
manded a troop of cavalry under lee
and from what ive heard his people
have lived along the james river valley
for a couple of hundred years in one
county or another but really burton
while your idea is a good-hearted one and
all that it isnt business you know ihe

old fellow cant hang on much longer 
if he doesnt borrow from you he will
from someone else and sooner or later
the place will get away from him

  not necessarily - his wanting to
make improvements looks as if he were
perking up a bit no ive been thinking
of spending the easter holidays with
friends in that locality and ill look up
the old chap while im there its a rather
pretty country through that section-
might want to build a country-place my-
self i wont part with the mortgage un-
til ive looked around a bit anyhow

you tell the to-
bacco people
theres nothing
doing - for the
present at least

  on the follow-
ing thursday he
started for nor-
folk on the jef-
ferson and dur-
ing the short run
down the coast
found himself
thinking more
than once of the
sweet face which
had persisted in
remaining in his
m e m o r y ever
since his last visit
to the old do-
rn i n i o  some
years before as
the ship steadily
covered the miles
to cape henry he began to speculate
a little upon his chances of running
across the girl again whom she might
prove to be and the probabilities of her
having married since he last saw her he
was practically alone in the world and
from inclination had been a wanderer
ever since his inherited fortune enabled
him to come and go as he pleased

  the fairfaxes who lived in a quaint
old mansion upon the chesterfield bank
of the appomattox had been friends of
his family ever since he could remember
though burton seldom found the time
or opportunity to visit them so now

jinny
the red book magazine

when he rode over from sutherland
where the norfolk  western train had
dropped him they immediately sent one
of the stable-boys for his luggage insist-
ing with their usual hospitality that he
should make their home his headquarters
whether lie had business elsewhere or
not in fact they made him feel one of
themselves so much that it was several
days before he reached the point of mak-
ing inquiries about the campbell planta-
tion hut when he finally did so the
general at once gave orders to have him
driven over the odd twelve miles beyond
the river-though the ladies cautioned
him laughingly to see that jinny
campbell didnt capture him for the rest
of his stay when lie arrived at sunny-
side it was a delicious spring morning
earlier in its warmth and greenness than
the northern season and he lazily gave
himself up to the enjoyment of it-
questioning black sam now and then
concerning the plantations they passed
and the neighboring families throughout
the section

  presently as they were driving up a
hill not far from namoxine creek there
was a clatter of hoofs down a wood-road
which led to theirs and in a moment
two spirited horses cantered up to them
-one ridden by a lovely dark-haired
girl who sat her saddle cn cavalier as if
she were a part of her mount and the
other by a middle-aged man who grasped
the pommel of his saddle tightly with
one hand while he tried to seem uncon-
scious that he was being tossed an inch
or two into the air at every bound sam
chuckled audibly as he watched him-
but when he turned to the girl his ex-
pression was a mixture of adoration and
wholesome respect burton was studying
her face with an intentness of which he
was altogether unconscious but which
brought a touch of color into her cheeks

why howdy mis jinny-howdy

  a touch of the little silver spur and
she was ott like a whirlwind-her escort
pounding after her as best he might in
a way that spoke better for his grit than
his horsemanship sam watched them out
of sight with the absorbed expression of
one who has been raised among horses
and unquestionably knows a good thing
when he seesll

  for the next two miles burton had
food enough for thought to keep him
busy the face which had haunted his
dreams and the beautiful girl on the bay
horse were identical-though the possi-
bility of such a thing had never occurred
to him the name of jinnv campbell
had been mentioned often enough in his
hearing at the fairfaxes but he had
never associated her personality with that
of the young girl who had been so much
in his thoughts since their brief meeting
three years before and for awhile the
wonder of it-the fact that he was in a
fair way to know her intimately-occu-
pied him to the exclusion of everything
else then-the situation concerning her
fathers plantation began to intrude it-
an easter entanglement

sell as something which might affect her
vitally

  lo a business-man with he inside in-
formation he possessed it became evident
that the big tobacco companies were
trying to obtain the colonels property
and were willing to pay something more
than it appeared to be worth why was
there some underlying reason which had
not come to light was it minerals they
were after-or what this man absum
for instance-infatuated with virginia
campbell by the look of him but none
the less probably sounding the colonel
upon every weak point he could find in
order to get hold of his land-was un-
doubtedly acting in their interest and
with a man of campbells presumably
unsuspicious nature seemed in a fair
way to succeed in his efforts burton de-
termined to wire graham that night to
advance the colonel an extra two or three
thousand on his mortgage if he wished
and to make it a point that he should
borrow of no one else

  now miss virginia when she met so
frankly the direct look of sams stranger
on the buckboard had been conscious of
an unexplained desire to know him bet-
ter-to stand well with him burton was
not pretty in the sense of being dainty
or effeminate but his six feet of superb
manhood compelled liking and respect
at the first glance the lines of his face
were strong and determined and his
clear brown eyes inspired confidence in
the man or woman who looked into them
so not finding her father on the porch
when they arrived she galloped down
to the creek after him and he was just
sauntering along to the house when sam
drove around

  an elderly negro the colonels body-
servant came down the steps as burton
sprang from the buckboard and grinned
as he caught sight of the strangers face

  dah now-ef hit aint majo buh-
ton frum oveh to ginral faihfax fo

didnt know you lived over this way
that must be the colonel himself com-
ing up the drive isnt it

   yassuh yassuh  dats mahrs geoge

  burton stepped forward to meet the
gentleman-a typical southerner frock-
coat soft hat white mustache and all

to introduce myself though the fair-
faxes said it would be hardly necessary
not in the least suh-not at all

  during the meal burtons liking for
his delightful host and hostess increased
as rapidly as his aversion to mr ab-
sum-a smooth keen man of affairs
whose efforts to seem excessively cour-
teous gave an indefinable impression to
the new yorker that a strong personal
object lay behind them

  with the idea of diverting suspicion


the red hook magazine

from his own purpose in the others
mind lie dropped a few remarks which
indicated that he was a rich young
fellow with impractical ideas as to busi-
ncss-matters who was looking for in-
vestment  and during the conversation
he stated with apparent frankness that
he was thinking of putting a few thou-
sands into good to-
bacco-land having
been told by the
fairfaxes that col-
onel campbell was
in position to give
h i m considerable
information upon
the subject

  absum smiled
indulgently at this
-though he shot
a rather searching
glance at the
northerner as if
trying to fathom
some hidden mo-
tive - and said
carelessly

  there is always
a satisfaction mr

burton in raising
ones own tobacco
for personal con-
sumption but i
think the colonel
here will agree
with me that it re-
quires an experience of years to pro-
duce a crop which is profitable commer-
cially it seems to be a generally accepted
belief up north that one has only to
plant a few acres with tobacco and then
sit down and enjoy the money that is
bound to roll in from the crop just as
people think that oranges in florida
will bring a comfortable income without
much trouble in growing them but most
any disinterested person in virginia will
say that youll get more of a run for
your money in wall street

  seeing from his expression that the
colonel was upon the point of differing
somewhat from this point of view burton
adroitly changed the subject to horses
upon which absum was as unfamiliar as
the others were conversant he feared

that if the topic became absorbing it
might bring the speculator to making an
offer which could not be ignored by any
planter in straitened circumstances

   later on while miss jinny detained
him at the house-acting upon an im
pulse which she herself scarcely under-
stood-the old gentleman asked burton
to stroll over a part
of his ground
which  a y along
the bank of naru-
oxine creek when
they were half a
mil cf rom the
house the colonel
took from his case
a home-made cigar
which he passed to
his guest without
comment burton
lighted it took a
whiff or two ex-
amined it closely
and in some won-
derment asked 
do you find it
profitable colonel
to import cuban
tobacco as a fill-
er

  no suh that
leaf was grown
right heah on mah
own place

  the younger
man took a few more puffs in silence as
they walked along by the creek a glim-
mering of the situation was beginning to
dawn upon him

  hm-m-rn-may  ask if our friend
mr absumhas tried one of these cigars
i rather imagine he is a pretty good
judge of tobacco

  why - ah - no suh ahm afraid
ahve been somewhat lacking in the co-
tesy due misto absum he is not as ah
might say one of ouch own people-and
ah-well-those plants wah mo o less
an expehiment of mine only mah field-
hands know just wheiah that leaf is
planted and it is so fah from the road
that a strangeh would scahcely happen
upon it yuh come from oueh stawk
majo to be frank with yuh ah find it

colon campbell
an easi er entanglement

difficult to give misto absum mah en-
tteh confidence though ahve no ground
whatever fo such a feeling

  well as i said at the table colonel
i am thinking seriously of investing
down here and while  dont suppose you
would care to part with an interest in
your land-i know too little of planting
to attempt it on my own hook- would
consider it a personal favor if youd give
me a first option in case you should ever
decide to increase your cultivating
yuh shall suhtnly have it majo in
fact ah will say that nothing would
please me betteh than to have yuh asso-
ciated with me if ah should consideli
putting mo hands on the place and
raising a lahgeh crop

  burton had picked up a handful of
ihe loam and was examining it care-
fully

  do you know sir this earth looks to
me very similar to that in a certain dis-
trict of minar del rio it seems to have a
peculiar oily softness isnt it partly due
to this soil that you have been able to
grow such a leaf as  find in your cigar
ah have no hesitation in admitting it
to yuh majo though ah trust yuh will
not mention it thet theiah soil does not
extend mon fo hundred feet from the
creek suh and ahve not seen it eitheh
above o below mah land on this heah
bank it has never been possible befo
mah expehiments to get the propeh
flavo out of cuban seed in this state-o
anywheah else

  that being the case if  may offer a
suggestion i would not attempt to sell a
pound of it until you have a full crop
ready for market burton replied
then it seems to me that you will do
much better with it in london than in
new york your success with cuban
seed is likely to antagonize the interest
and by trumping up a report that you
were actually smuggling in havana to-
bacco they could get the government to
make a whole lot of trouble for you
the colonel stood for a moment in
deep thought an expression of disgust
and discouragement lining his handsome
features

  do yuh know suh that neveh oc-
 ulid tu me it may be that yuhah right

ahve had the feeling fo some time that
mah factos in richmond wah not deal-
ing with me in the manneh in which gen-
tlemen ah accustomed to conduct theiah
affaiahs the times all changing suh
a gentlemans wod was sufficient fo any
statement he caiahd to make in mah
fathehs time  and any planteh of good
stawk conducted his affaiahs without in-
tehfehance from outsidehs but in ou-i
dealings to-day - well suh ah can
scahcely admit it to yuh but theah ah
times when ah almost doubt the honesty
of ma busi ness-acquain tances 

  knowing from his acquaintance with
virginian people that the colonels prom-
ise of an option would block any under-
handed attempt that absum or the
syndicates back of him might make bur-
ton thought it better not to wire graham
when he returned to the fairfax place
that evening but during the next few
days he got the general to make a few-
cautious inquiries which resulted in his
acquiring through a third party some
three hundred acres of wood-land in
amelia county upon the bank of the
namoxine directly opposite to the
campbell plantation and extending be-
yond it up and down the creek having
satisfied himself that the soil was exactly
the same as that upon the colonels land
that absum had not forestalled him was
only explainable by the supposition that
he had as yet only a suspicion as to the
value of the old gentlemans experi-
ments based upon the general high
quality of his former crops

  at the end of the week he dropped a
confidential hint to general fairfax con-
cerning his holding the campbell mort-
gage as an excuse for leaving his
hospitable friends and moved over to
sunnyside where he was received with
a friendliness which left no doubt as to
the genuineness of his welcome then
followed a succession of warm spring
days in which he gave himself up to
the mere enjoyment of living in such
congenial surroundings the business-
side of the situation he kept in hand with
little effort the matter drifting along in
such a w-av that he found it unnecessary
to give it much thought though he was
aware of sundry interviews between ab-

ol tills appearecf  their manner or in the
little household attentions which added
to his comfort the family silver-every
piece of it an heirloom-and the colonial
glasses sparkled as brightly upon the
dinner-table as they had in the old re-
gime when the campbells of other gen
erations had counted their slaves by the
hundred the old house was scrupulously
clean and the linen beautifully laund-
ered in a way that would have made a
city matron green with envy the meals
were abundant and the sherry of a rich-
ness which lingered in the memory but

sum and the colonel which evidently
failed to give the former astute gentle-
man much satisfaction but absum was
persistent fully as much from his infat

the colonels carefully brushed coats were
shiny at the elbowsand miss virginias
gowns were more limited in variety and

uation for miss virginia as from the val-
uable property that seemed almost within
his reach and it was the social side of
the matter which aroused every ounce of
burtons determination to get the better
of him the thought of a woman like
jinny campbell beyig bought by a
creature of absums caliber - through
force of grinding circumstances and her
love for her father-made him grit his
teeth

  it became evident to him from little
things which came under his observation
that as far as ready-money went even
the pocket-money for little necessaries-
both the colonel and miss jinny were
seriously embarrassed not that any sign

sunday morning founri them in the pew
an easter entanglement



number than a woman likes to have no-
ticed by the stranger within her house

  he came upon her one day in her fa-
vorite nook on the side veranda busily
stitching upon an inexpensive muslin
gown which she laughingly admitted
was destined for her easter appearance
in the old church where the campbell
pew had been a prominent one for up-
wards of a hundred and fifty years and
where the colonel never failed to seat
himself each sunday morning that
same afternoon clem-who had prompt-
ly classed the new yorker as old vir
ginia stock and consequently almost one
of the family-confided to him that a
new and most becoming hat which she
had admired in petersburg would prob-
ably materialize if he could persuade a
neighboring planter to buy his pet gor-
don setter which the old body-servant
had raised from a pup and burton then
and there entered into a conspiracy with
him which resulted not only in clems
retaining possession of his beloved dog
but also the purchase of a lovely india
silk gown which she was known to have
had in mind

   yo see majo he explained in their
whispered confab mis jinny would er
bin all right dis easteh but de intrus on
de mogidge done come eroun jes erbout
dis time n mahrs geoge he couldnt
git de vance he done spexted on de
crap dem yeah richmon baccy folks
done gittin meaneh en meaneh evey
yeah ff mahrs geoge ony hab de
money to wuk foty o fifty bans ober de
place he done git rich fo sho

  never mind clem i reckon i know
a way to help him out on the crop a little
and you can think up some kind of a
yarn thatll sound all right about the
dress of course you know she wouldnt
accept it from me

  no sah-o couse she wouldnt mis
jinny en mahrs geoge am quality-
dey am

  presently absum dropped along
mounted on one of the more sedate pick-
ett mares and when virginia rode off
with him there was a self-satisfied ex-
pression upon his saturnine face that
caused burton some uneasiness nor was
it lessened upon her return when she ap-

peared strangely preoccupied and went
almost immediately to her room leaving
her escort to sprawl comfortably in one
of the veranda-chairs and speak patron-
izingly to the colonel of his many prom-
ising investments that he had brought
some pressure to bear upon the girl
seemed almost certain to the northerner
and the fact that she hadnt dismissed
him finally looked ominous scarcely
conscious of what he was doing he got
up and walked off toward the rear of the
house to do a little quiet thinking and
almost ran into clem who was muttering
to himself behind a clump of laurels
clem 

  yassuh

  i believe that fellow has been bother-
ing miss jinny about something
yassuh ah brulc him gizzard fo
long fo sho

  humph id like to myself but i
cant as long as she lets the fellow come
here without objecting to him look here
clem-i want you to do something for
me and do it quick will you

  yo bet yo life ah will majo yos
all right yo is ah reckon mis jinny
she tink so too

  well you go to her at once-make
her listen to you no matter whether she
wants to or not-and tell her you know
about something that you cant explain
but which is going to fix the colonel all
right about money matters-going to
put him on easy street dont you dare
breathe a word to her of this but im go-
ing to help him myself ive got enough
cash to live without working and he isnt
going to worry any more for the rest of
his life understand

  ah-ah reckon so majo bress your
haht look heah suh-why don yo tek
er ride wi mis jinny evey mawnin-
before dat scallywag done come eroun
dat brack mah am jes erbout right fo
yo

  you mean bess shes a beauty
i didnt think the colonel would care
about having me ride her how do you
know she wont break my neck

  how ah know dat

  clem doubled up and chuckled

  fo de lan majo vo mek me laff
aint ah done see yo laigs an de way


the red book magazine

yo walks vo jes lemme put dat ahmy
saddle on huh in de mawnin an try
huh mahrs geoge he be pleased to deff

to hab yo ride huh

  clem hurried nil to act upon his in-
structions and after breakfast in the
morning burton appeared in breeches
and puttees as prince was led around
to the door for the girl

  ah yu reahlly going with me ma-
jo she cried oh ahm so pleased
vu neveh said yu liked to ride-re-
proachfully-and on hess do be
caiahful when yuh mount or shell bolt
with yuh

   just to carry out the joke he put on a
serious expression when he took the reins
and started to put his foot in the stirrup
the mare looked at him mischievously
out of one eye and as he had been
warned reared as if she were about to
run but with a quick and steady pressure
on the oft rein he pulled her head around
almost to the cinch knot and swung
easily into the saddle before she knew he
was off the ground for a second or two
sie went up in the air and tried to unseat
him then with a shake of her pretty-
head gave it up as a bad job and can-
tered daintily up the road

  for several minutes miss jinny
watched him curiously in the general
scheme of her ideas this northerner this
yankee-masterful and attractive though
he certainly was to her-had no business
to ride like that raised among horses as
they are the people of the south have
nice conceptions of what constitutes
horsemanship-and this man sat his sad-
dle as if lie had been reared in one the
mare too with the sympathetic instinct
in all highly-bred animals seemed to ac-
cept him both as friend and master obey-
ing the touch of his knees quite as quickly
as his light grasp of the reins

  that ride was one she never forgot
in her after years as wife and mother
she often looked back to it as the time
when she first seriously questioned her-
self concerning the place he had won in
her heart cultivated beyond the point
that most women reach-by the daily
companionship with her father in his
library - she found herself wondering
appreciatively at his rich fund of infor-

mation and anecdote he had seen the
world as few young men see it intelli-
gently absorbingly he knew horses and
books and plants and men and the
worlds eternal cities intimately and
with it all was a comprehension of wom-
an s ways that hehimselfnever realized

  at luncheon time they found them-
selves miles away from the plantation in
another county and dropped in upon a
family of friends to eat then through
the long afternoon they rode over the
v irginia hills in the warm spring sun-
shine stopping once to gather a bunch of
the first violets-through patches of
woodland along the banks of the slug-
gish namoxine perfectly content to be
alone with each other and their horses

  that was the beginning of it absum
had no other rides with her nor could he
get an opportunity to speak with her
alone the contrast between the two men
was too great in her mind and some
how against her better judgment she
found herself relying upon the vague but
emphatic hints which clem had dropped
about the apparently impossible assist
ance which in some mysterious way was
coming down through the air to help her
father

  lach days ride drew them closer to-
gether and as easter sunday approached
he found himself quite naturally assist-
ing with the friends and neighbors he
had come to know so well in the decora-
tion of the old church the great catli
arine-window at the back of the chancel
had been the gift of some campbell of
other days and his artistic taste was giv-
en free rein in the bordering of it with
palmettos and lilies

  on the morning after good friday
two mysterious boxes arrived from pe-
tersburg and though clem was put to a
most searching cross-examination he lied
like a gentleman and managed in a great
measure to satisfy her suspicions the
colonels best coat was brushed and
sponged until only a close examination
would have revealed its years of honor-
able service and on sunday morning the
opening hymn found the three of them
clothed in something better than outward
respectability in the campbell pew
while the family servants in their best

array of holiday colors and shining black
facts filled their own traditional benches

in the transept

  whether it was the spell of the easter
music or some inward consciousness of a
psychological crisis that brought mat-
ters to a focus burton could not have ex-
plained liut as they were standing close
together during the recessional his hand
gently closed upon hers-and received a
responsive pressure

  next morning he sat in his accustomed
place at her left while the sunbeams
played hide and seek among the pieces of
gleaming siher upon the break fast-table
-and when clem had removed every-
thing but the coffee and cigars he smil-
ingly looked across at the colonel while
he slipped a ring upon the finger which
she confidingly leached to him

  perhaps it isnt exactly your way
colonel he said but up north we like
to be sure of the girl before we speak to
her father i hope however that you
have no serious objections

  none whateveh suh ah think ah
may say majo that ah recognized some
of the symptoms befo this inawning vo
mothehs son will be a most welcome ad-

dition to mah family suh but-ah trust
yuh will pahdon mah cuiosity-

  burton had drawn from his pocket a
somewhat imposing looking document
and first holding it over the spirit lamp
which heated the coffee-urn was delib-
erately lighting his cigar with it

  i hope yuh ah destroying nothing of
value to yuh by mistake majo

  nothing of any further value sir its
merely the old mortgage on your planta-
tion-and-er-it occurred to me that
this was a fitting tune to make a sort of
barbecue of it im going to give jinny
three hundred acres on the other side of
the creek for a wedding-present alto-
gether it ought to make a nice little
property for us

  twice the old gentleman tried to speak
-tried to express himself in a fitting and
a dignified way but as virginia slipped
around to the arm of burtons chair and
pressed her lips softly upon his the colo-
nel resting his trembling hands upon the
table could only bend toward them with
one of his courtly old-fashioned saluta-
tions-and slowly step through one of
the long windows out upon the sunny
veranda

out of the water just up-stream from the
bridge thems the remains of the iden-
tical trestle we built over the river tem-
porary that year right on that trestle
did doodie drive home his last spike as
a bridgeman

  youve heard me speak of doodie
mebbe more times than enough there
was a boy six feet in his stoekins
straight as a douglas fir soople an thin
in the flanks as a mountain-lion deep-
chested as a shorthorn bull-my eye but
he was the number to put your money
on he could lift a load that big jim
here couldnt budge runnin jumpin
wraslin-it was all the same he was
the king-pin no two men on the job
could move him out of his tracks an him
laughin all the time they was tuggin at
him laughin an kiddiii-that was him
from sun to sun kind-hearted as a pony
he wouldnt hurt a sandfly but look out
fer that iron-grip of his when ye started
in to rough-house him he wouldnt be
beat that boy in sport or earnest them
was the jolly days when doodie bunked
right here beside me in this car

  big jim the straw-boss was galled
by the reflection on his strength

  how he asked did a real man
ever come to git a fool name like
doodie 

  jus was quick to the defense of his
favorite

   that was nothin against him no
moren ontario is against ike here
first it was the dood before we
rightly got acquainted with him fer it
didnt seem natral that a man that
washed an combed himself three times a
day an put on his coat to come to meals
could be cut out of the same piece of
goods as a genuine bridgeman doodie
it was though when hed sung his first
song sing like a bird he had songs
an stories on tap sames irish mike
keeps calgary beer that boy had enough
fun in him to make a chain-gang stuck
on its job

  fer six weeks after that flood of 
we was at it night an day fer six weeks
we did our ten hours overtime-no time-
an a-half allowed them days neither fer
that was years before the strike-doin
our double time as i said an not a man

so much as beefed at the hours not even
grouchy jake so much as threatened to
call fer his card

  that was all doodies doins he
was like a man made of steel cables ye
couldnt see a sign of wear in him his
laugh an his joke an his song an his
story was like one of them shows that
begins as soon as it stops we was havin
the time of our lives

  curious remarked ike in a spirit
of friendly inquiry how a man like that
ever come to be on a bridge-crew

  gus thought hunted readily down this
trail

  curious it was ike an curious it
stayed when doodie wanted to close
that square ironwood jaw of his you
couldnt pry it open with a spike-bar
close it he did anyway about the ptic-
lar trouble that had side-tracked him in
a bridge-outfit

  him an his old mand had words i
made sure of that afterwards there was
a petticoat somewheres in the stew too
i knew that fer the boy used to get let-
ters an often of a sunday afternoon hed
be off with his writin-pad to some spot
where he could talk to his girl with
nothin but the mountains to look over
his shoulder ihe girl i had it figgered
didnt suit the old man  an my guess as
it turned out wasnt a mile wide there
must a been a cute little family-jar the
day doodie had to make his choice be-
tween the old mans coin an the girls red
cheeks the cheeks won with furlongs to
spare if i know doodie an another pic-
ture was turned to the wall

  the boyd had two years in a trainin-
school of some kind back east the
teck i think he called it structural
engineer-i mind thats what he said
hed been trainin fer an a dandy train-
in it must a been there wasnt a gird-
er nor a brace in a hull truss span but
he could tell to a pound what strain it
ought to bear he knew bridgin by the
book from a to z not much wonder he
took to the real thing when he found
himself up against it in the west scotty

this yarn both ends to once like a pig of-
ferin battle the start of it all was that

j une snow-storm

  we was stand in on the gap sidin
just where the iron dives into the rock-
ies an the snow penned us in like hens
in a thunderstorm a storm like that was
a new thing to doodie he watched it
like a kid with a new toy he kept tab on
the snow creepin up the trunk of a
stunted cottonwood an weightin down
its branches till he vowed it was like
nothin but an overgrowed mushroom
down straight down come that snow
fer three days an nights hissm gentle
as it settled same way its doin now

   doodie had words ler everythin the
sky was lead the foothills rollin away
fer miles was the ocean-swells froze
stiff an white seemed as if he just felt
fer everythin whether it was alive or
not them range-cattle bunched on the
lee-side of a hill an hunchin their backs
into the storm was the only thing  ever
saw that made him right downhearted
many a bone the coyotes picked on that
hillside when all was over

  first day the transcon came in
from the east a-kickin up clouds of
snow fer all the world like a kid wadin
through maple leaves in october next
day she came under a double-header fol-
lowin a snow-plow an eight hours late
the third day she was stalled a hundred
miles back on the prairie

   let the sun come out to-morrow
says i to doodie an this outfitll be the
busiest gang of bridge-builders this side
the river jordan

  come out it did fer fair my eye
that snow sure walked away doodies
frozen-sea broke into islands where the
hilltops poked through then into
peninsulas and continents an all the
names in the gography the hull prairie
was one shinin sloppy mess of muddy
water huntin fer the low spots the
kananaskis began tumblin over the fall
with a roar you could hear clean to the
sidin an you know how far that is we
was up against the real thing

  a mud-slide at shaganappi a wash-
out at gleichen  culberts here trestles
there-they high-balled us from end to
end of the divisionwe was next in im-

portance them days to old hunch grass
w hiskers himself we kept the line open

 he schedule was knocked crazy to be
sure but everythin was gittin through

     doodie was like a trout winnin up
stream he was havin the time of his life
 man says he to me this i life
i his is where real men are doin things
im goin to hold down this job as long
as itll stay with me

   grinned an said nothin knowin
too well thatwhen the boys right life
called to him hed go to it like the goose
heads north in the spring  was right
an the call wasnt long cornin

  the thing happened when the twins
went our that was the last hand the how
had to play an she sure caught us all
four hushin we was down at the east
end polishin off the small jobs an
thinkin a hull nights sleepd go good
when scotty got the message

     snow-slide in mountains bow above
   high-water mark an risin twins in
   danger

     hat was the finish of the sleep-ques-
tion fer another two weeks no 
ahead of a silk-special dropped her
string at moosejaw an whipped us over
the prairie till our teeth rattled with the
joltin at calgary we found out what
we was up against it was pilin across
the how in tioods the twins was out
one span was piled up on the bank a mile
down-stream  the other was hangin with
one end on the river-bottom collectin a
jam of driftwood

  it was midnight by the time we was
droppin down the grade to the river me
an doodie sat on a car of piles takin
in the hull lay-out my eye there was
a mess they had headlights from dead
engines in the calgary roundhouse stuck
up on every high spot an the glare of
em just cut a jagged hole in the dark
round where the men was work in it was
like turnin a searchlight into hell-that
was doodies way of puttin it

   every man on the division that could
be let loose on the job from old bunchy
himself to scab egan with his extra
gang of douks was chasin his own
shadow like a demon gone batty across
the river was mose gregson from the
pacific-division thuddin away at a pile

with his old drop-hammer driver him
pilin from the west an us from the east
our trestles was to meet mid stream

  mid-stream my eye but that was a
place fer flesh an blood to be ihe old
bowd got up over her banks till the
main current looked like a river tearin
its way through a lake rushin swirlin
back-eddyin in the glare of them head-
lights she seemed to be just laughin at
what shed be doin to us an our little
pile-drivers an just to show what she
could do shed send every minute a log
or a tree shootin like a bolt from a cat-
apult through the yawnin hole where
the first span used to stretch from the
far bank the twisted timbers of the sec-
ond span was bangin like a wrecked
cage with the wild beast broke loose
sure a fiercer proposition was never put
up to bridge-gang

    oodie says i whatd the books
tell ye to do with a hole like that

  the brakes was grindin beneath us
but he had time to answer

    books says lie  guess this is a
place where nothin counts but horse-
sense and iron-grit

   so it was but  aint goin to tell how
we piled that stream them of you thats
been through the like knows all about
it them that hasnt is like to know before
theyre many days older we met old
mose at last an steel joined steel again

    ihe day we drove that last bent a
curious thing happened

  on the east side a dinin-car drew
up  on the west we heard the whistle of
the east-bound transom the first in
four days twasnt long till we saw
what old bunch was up to them pas-
sengersd been tied up in the mountains
till they was well nigh famished an here
was their first chance fer a square noth-
in short of starvation would a drove
some of them over that half-finished
trestle on foot to see them stringin
across was pay for all the hard work an
lost sleep

  so many glad rags  never look to
see on a bridge again dainty womend
leave their dood men an put their white-
gloved hands in the grimy paw of a
bridgeman an cling to him so theyd
clean fergit to hold up their flummery

skirts out of the black oil many a man
turned back willin to go hungry rather
than risk his precious neck bunc h irass
was here an there amongst em all you
know his way polite as pie to a pas-
senger but crusty as a shell-crab to every
one else

  i was right in mid-stream while the
procession was passin i was holdin one
end of a rope snubbed round a rail
doodie was hangin to the other end of
the rope just a foot from the water spik-
in a brace to a pile just then along
comes an old chap-a swell old party he
was-pickin his steps like he was wishin
himself on a good ash felt pavement but
cornin just the same like nothin could
stop him gittin that dinner at the roads
expense

   thats where  was on the wrong
sidin ihe old gent slops in front of me
an says he

    can you tell me says he if theres
a young man named david graham in
this crew

   that came mighty nigh bein the end
of doodies story right there i was that
flabbergasted i was only brought to by
the rope slippinthrough me hands it
wasnt what the old gent said  it was the
look of him fer all his dood fixins an
his iron-gray hair it was doodie himself
speakin to me - doodie grown older
heavier sterner lookin but still doodie
it was the same voice the same clean
square jaw the same compel  in eye

  graham says i whend id got
sand on the rails graham search me
says i better ask scotty there

  graham says scotty sure thing
wheres doodie gus

  my eye  you should a seen that man
lookin down at doodie the boy was
hangin by one hand an swingin a ten-
pound hammer in the other with the cur-
rent swirlin round the piles an sendin
up dashes of spray at him like wolves
leapin up at a man bangin to a limb
its nothin of course to you thats done
it an doodie was doin it like it was
nothin but fer a man that cant pick his
stepxs over a trestle without it seemin to
slide up-stream from under his feet it
was a soul twistin place to find his boy
there was never a word from the old
how the way was opened



mans lips but there was a look in his
eyes that minded me of the eyes of a
range-cow when theyre brandin her
calf

  hand over hand came doodie up at
last

  dad he yells an jumps fer the
old mans paw there was just nothin
in his voice but surprise an welcome

  it was the dad that seemed to be git-
tin the worst of it somehow talk
didnt seem to come easy to him he
hangs to doodies hand an says he like
he was talkin to a bigger man than him-
self

   davy says he come home-wont
you 

  that wont you at the last he kind
of tacked on like he felt he hadnt been
humble enough

  doodie draws back he looks at the
old man like a father thats denyin
somethin to his child-denyin it because
he cant come by it honest an clean

   theres emily dad i havent
changed about her he says

  david graham senior was his right
self fer just one second o time hed
swallowed about all the humble-pie he

was guaranteed to hold he pranced a
step towards doodie till all at once it
occurred to him that that bridge was no
place fer fancy steps

   drat you boy he yells how could
i have located you up an down a thou-
sand miles of railway if i hadnt gone
hat in hand to her to find out where
youd got to isnt that enough boy
-he fair sputtered it this time-boy
come home

  doodie turned away he looked at
the white line of the mountains just
shovvin through the blue  he looked at
the unbroken prairie rollin away with-
out bounds to the sky-line bein free-
thats what these things had meant to
him he was at home with them they
gave him the feelin of havin elbow-
room he sniffed the air like an antelope
on the crest of a rise he looked at the
men gapin as if the road had nothin
fer them to do he looked long at me
his partner his bunk-mate he gulped
hard

   scotty says he-an the hammer
hed been holdin slipped from his hand
an clattered on the bridge-i guess ill
have to ask you fer my time

street she with the point of her gray
shawl centering her drab skirt low down
upon its border and with the plaited
back of her narrow sugar-scoop bonnet
directly above the fold of bobbinet about
her neck they resembled a pair of spar-

of what their own devotion would ever
be in strength and lasting quality

  sixty years before the memorable day
when the two walked for the first time
arm in arm on penn street and were with
smiles and tears ami united hearts of
gladness dubbed  the sparrows they
were fond lovers giving to each other

rows for the nonce at peace and with
intent above forage one would not have
been surprised to see them hop to an
overhanging branch and to hear them
twitter lovingly therefrom

  the sympathies of plumtowns people
and of all others along the widespread
ramifications of its family and sect inter-
ests were actively with the couple lov-
ers pointed to them as glowing examples

their first love and troth happy in both
and in the formal sanction of parents
and meeting with that quiet delibera-
tion which rules among quakers they
but waited a suitable opportunity at
which to go through the semi-religious
ceremony and sign the contract in the
presence of family and friends which
would unite them as man and wife
lydia petite rounded brown-eyed with
how the way was opened



the plain lines of her hair lying to her
face as leaves to a peach or the wings of
 tanager to its dazzling breast was busy
stitching her happiness into the best of
household linen anti choice stuffs of regu-
lation excellence for her wear josiah
then sturdy ruddy with the joyous en-
ergy of a terrier after a rat was primming
the farm and roomy mansion his grand-
father had bequeathed him into neat
readiness for the competent sway of
lydia as lydia patton

  in the long low plumtown meeting-
house and everywhere in the society of
friends a theological storm was brew-
ing it broke with full force on plum-
town families weredivided old friends
were parted intolerance was rampant
he broad-brimmed hats in plumtown
meeting trembled with anger upon the
heads of those who believed themselves
governed by inward light only and
fists were handled with a directness and
vigor that gave evidence of other than
noncombative control the father of jo-
siah patton mashed the hat and scattered
the teeth of the father of lydia ash-
mead as they headed the nearly equally-
divided factions tradition hath it that
the melee was preceded by such person-
alities as thees a liar and thee be
damned but it is not so set down in the
 minutes of plumtown meeting

  the tide of difference was too obstin-
ate for words to stem or blows to backen
a formal separation of the factions was
agreed upon so strong was family ad-
hesion among the pattons and ashmeads
that when the meeting property was
divided equably as it was at plumtown
josiah retained his seat on one side of the
board partition erected to divide the
meeting-house into two meeting-rooms
and lydia ashmead took her seat on the
other

  the day of the separation the factions
left the meeting-house by different doors
in the meeting-house yard the general
old-time clasp of hands welcoming
smiles loving greetings were no more
an invisible line was drawn between the
parted groups across which even eyes
were too stubborn to venture josiahs
head was bowed his face was drawn by
sorrow once he raised his eyes and

looked piteously across the yard for
lydia ashmead her face was flushed
radiant with purpose she was looking di-
rectly at him lost to all about her her
brown eyes shone with love her arms
half left her side in supplicating reach
her body leaned towards him with a
yearning slope when their eyes met jo-
siah felt an incoming of strength his
blue eyes flashed his very soul he saw
lydia start toward him  he met her half-
way there on the sward between the
two glaring crowds they stood locked
in each others arms  the broad -brimmed
hat of josiah closing like a lid the flar-
ing face of lydias deep-mouthed bon-
net she gently separated herself from
him but kept her hand upon his shoul
der her face was trustful happy as she
spoke to him her tone was firm full of
staunch promise 

  be strong josiah keep thy trust in
thy heavenly father tet us do our duty
as it is shown to us let us be cheerful
and helpful  will love thee until death
shall separate us

  t will love thee until death shall sep-
arate us he echoed but his voice trem-
bled i will love thee always as i do
now we shall wait farewell

  farewell josiah

  they parted lydia went back to her
mother josiah walked out of the gate
head up mounted his horse and rode
away friends on both sides watched
them with softened faces  the spirit of
sympathy waved factional enmity back
women sought their reticules for hand-
kerchiefs men turned their faces from
one another

  after the fray in his home lydias
father-thomas ashmead-called her to
him

  lydia he spoke firmly to-day
william patton overpowered me by
blows when i withstood him somewhat
violently with words perhaps i should
not have allowed even the spirit of right
to prompt my various movements of
wrathful significance the flesh is weak
thee is a good daughter a comfort and
light to thy mother and myself my heart
goes out to thee nevertheless josiah
patton - son of william-must never
again enter this house put away all

thought of him as speedily as thee can
 feel it within me that thee has the
strength to do so i here can be no hap-
piness no unity in your marriage he has
strayed from our fold does thee fully
understand my wishes thee has been an
obedient daughter

  steadfast purpose in lydia was not
rebellion ino rush of temper or indigna-
tion or protest disturbed the calm wom-
anliness of her face or gave a quiver to
her mellow voice as she replied

  yes father  understand thee  will
not seek josiahs company neither will
he seek mine when he knows of thy ob-
jections my love for him i cannot will
not put away thee has taught me to
obey the inward light it tells me to
love josiah

  is thy conscience clear in that ly-
dia 

   yes quite clear

  then i exact obedience in the separa-
tion only in thy love thy conscience must
be thy guide

  lydias mother in the quiet of her
room pressed her daughter to her breast
in long fond silence

  my dear daughter thy father knows
the strength of a womans love thy
heavenly father will direct thee in the
right way was all she said

  josiahs father-william patton-was
made of more militant stuff than thomas
ashmead  is ancestors had fought with
ireton at nasebv and marston moor
had withstood in buff and helmet the
fierce charges of wild prince ruperts
dashing cavaliers on many a hard fought
field  had gloried in the title of crom-
wells roundheads and after the res-
toration had dared for consciences
sake to lay aside worldly things and ar-
ray themselves with the followers of
george fox in bearing testimony against
war titles church forms and ministry
and all that fettered human liberty in
body or conscience

  josiah he snapped viciously after
riding to his sons farm without tarrying
long enough at his home to press the
dents from his beaver hat or have repairs
made to his broken braces if a man
tells thee that thee lies thee is justified
in defending thyself against aspersion

with such natural might as has been giv
en thee even if thee damages his raiment
disfigures his features or as in my op-
portunity with thomas ashmead to day
exposes his deception in teeth not natur
ally abiding in his own head

  i came to speak to thee of lydia the
enraged man continued a pearl among
swine- except her mother thomas
ashmead will endeavor to estrange ly-
dia from thee lie of good cheer thee is
lydia s choice lydia is thy chosen one
 bee have proclaimed thy intention to
be joined in wedlockthee have formally
passed meeting she is thine take her
josiah even if thee has to smite thomas
ashmead hip and thigh

  that i will not father enmity
enough has been aroused friends have
this day shamed their principles lydia
and i are wedded in our love we arc in
unity we will wait our heavenly fath-
ers time to be wedded in the flesh we
cannot be joined in marriage according
to the good order of friends unless in
the presence of a united meeting lydia
and i understand each other we will
not be cast down we will so love that
should the time come when we can be
united we can look into our hearts and
into each others eyes as we did but to-
day

  william patton gazed at his son stead-
fastly for a moment he saw his own
strong determination there and that the
fire in josiahs eyes was kindled from
trust not from human impluse that calls
for an eye for an eye and a tooth for
for a tooth

  thee is right josiah the old adam
abides in me still it is an unruly tenant
i will wrestle with it i will return to
my home and get thy mother to sew on
some buttons farewell

  he slowly rode away battling with
himself

  josiah was twenty-two lydia was
eighteen at the time of the separation
in the society of friends years passed
josiah skilfully managed his farm gen-
erously gave of his ample means where
help was needed carried his genial pres-
ence everywhere that assistance required
it or courtesy demanded it he ripened

the red book magazine

 into sterling manhood lydia living in
 the town relieved her mother of home
 duties blossomed in her brain and
 beauty and was the most winsome
 thoughtful woman of her many circles
 they saw each other when accident fa-

vored or common duties brought them
together it became a part of plum
towns creed that a wonderful presi irnn
selected these duties with the inlallibh
certainty of a meeting cheering smiles
loving assurances in glances were all
that passed between them on these oc-
casions

  plumtown became excited filled with
wonderment when josiah patton rented
his farm for a long term of years bought
a commodious house on penn street four
blocks from lydia brought an old fam-
ily servant to cart for it and him and
took up his abode therein still greater
was the surprise and many the knowing
smiles when early one morning a quick
ly moving team stopped at josiahs door
and the driver carried in two sizeable
rolls

  shortly afterward josiah ivmself
with a bundle of newspapers under his
arm visited each house in the town to
obtain subscribers for a daily delivery
of them explaining as lie did that the
stage carrying the mail from philadel
phia arrived but three times a week at
plumtown too seldom for such an en-
lightened and progressive place and
that he had resolved to give it daily
knowledge rain or shine first days ex-
cepted of what the world was doing be-
yond plumtowns limits

  at   p m-josiah timed his ar-
rival carefully having knowledge of
thomas ashmeads napping-hour - he
raised the iron knocker on his front door
and sounded a brave peal an old colored
servant turbaned aproned neatly-
shawled opened the door in response
she threw up her hands joyfully

  thank de lod its thee again jo-
siah  she exclaimed

  josiah smiled in a perfectly business-
like tone he addressed her

  rachel tell thy mistress lydia-
lydia thee understands-that i desire
her annual subscription for either the
public lciicr or the north american
or both which i will deliver at this door
daily first days excepted at ten
oclock precisely by the town-clocks
bell beginning to-morrow morning

  i will tell her-lydia

  the old servants eyes twinkled she

leaned toward josiah and said half in
fun half in confidence

  i dont believe old rachelll ebber
hab to open de do to dat knock

  josiah smiled again that will relieve
thee rachel farewell

  the years began afresh for the lovers
each day made young to them by a sin-
gle touch of voice and eye every morn-
ing at the stroke of ten josiah sounded
the knocker every morning never fail-
ing lydia neat smiling her eyes brim-
ming with love responded to the call
the daily salutations never varied 
good morning josiah is thee well
thank thee for the paper farewell
josiah answering her handing her
the paper had his eyes and thoughts as
far from it as utter obliviousness to busi-
ness warranted

  i am well thank thee lydia thee is
fair and dear to me as ever farewell
lydia light-hearted went about her
duties josiah light-stepping threw
crumbs from his pocket to the birds
which followed him and whistled gayly
as he threw

  twice in each temperate season ly-
dia with her maiden neighbor abigail
townsend walked to josiahs property
and paused to look over his fence at flow-
ering plants well-kept borders distant
pigeon-cotes and choicely filled chicken-
yards

  two or three days afterward friend
abigail was sure to call from her side
stoop

  lydia will thee come over  have
some flowers for thee

  when lydia blushing prettily re-
ceived them from abigails hands she
always heard the expected words

  they grew in josiahs garden dear
the anxious days of  came friend
were in a dilemma their testimony
had ever been borne against war ever
against slavery as stirring abolitionists
as active manipulators of the under-
ground railroad they had done much
lo rouse southern animosity and north-
ern firmness they were devoted union-
ists their principles prevented them
from taking up arms nevertheless their
hearts their sympathies were with those
of their countrymen who went to battle

believing that their precious ends would
be attained josiah patton had hard
struggles between the horns

one morning his knock at lydias
door was answered by old rachel josiah
paled the sight of another face than his


the red book magazine

loved one shocked him with apprehen-
sion

  where - where is lydia he stam-
mered

   she been gone yesterday afternoon to
keer fo de sanitary exhibition at phila-
delphia what takes keer ob de soldiers
she done tole me fo to ax yo fo to leab
her paper nex do with abigail town-
send lydia sot with her a long time be-
fo she went off

  josiah drew a breath of relief his
eyes flashed me pulled himself up and
together he flushed with high resolve
walking rapidly to abigail townsends
door he knocked handed two papers to
the servant but did not enter

  well he divined the purpose of ly-
dias request no need for abigail to tell
him why she lydia was giving help to
those in arms the way from his dilemma
was solved  it was for him a man to de-
fend his principles with his own hands
to take his share in the struggle to bear
his share of the burden lydia had seen
her duty was in the fulfillment of it-
caring for the soldiers ministering to
their comfort bolstering them to the
fight repairing them when wounded that
they might fight again he was in unity
with her

  in an hour he had placed his newspa-
per-contracts in the hands of a reliable
man in another he was mustered as a
private soldier before the sun went
down his quaker uniform was ex-
changed for that of a united states cav-
alryman and he swung his saber in the
awkward-squad drill with as resolute
vigor as did his ancestors in the days
when oliver cromwell led his men in
prayer and carnage

  never did knight of old go forth more
fearlessly more devotedly into battle
his shield blazoned with fur gott und
fiir i hr than did josiah patton with
the treasured promise of his love un-
til death shall separate us ringing
through his brain never from the day
he donned the brass shoulder-scales of a
private until he wore the dual bars of a
captain did he fail in a duty or hesitate
in an act of mercy

  often when with carbines leveled or
sabers uplifted his command held the

enemy in his power uis voice had called
warningly almost pleadingly to its com-
manding officer will thee surrender
intent on preventing the needless slaugh-
ter of men true and brave as his own

  his men respected loved him  the
fighting quaker earned the title from
both north and south

  at home lydia ashmead was among
the foremost in aiding the soldiers car-
rying cheer and comfort to their fam-
ilies consoling those who mourned for
the fallen but so many were the willing
voices and hands of women to do this
work that lydia by her sweet impres-
siveness quaker garb and brave brown
eyes won her way to the field hospitals
at the front and there even in the roar
of battle calmly skilfully did her noble
duty nobly

  the war over josiah patton scarred
maimed-an arm buried in the hallowed
ground of gettysburg-erect gray his
face mobile to every graciousness or set
to every right clad in quaker colors and
form strapped newspapers to his arm
less shoulder and on his daily round as
the town-clock struck ten sounded the
knocker of lydias door

  the same loving eyes the same wel-
coming met him 

  good morning josiah is thee well
thank thee for the paper farewell
regularly as of yore josiah made re-
sponse his blue eyes trusting as a
babys

  i am well thank thee lydia thee is
fair and dear to me as ever farewell
when lydia looked over josiahs
lawn-fence for the first time after his re-
turn she saw his sheathed saber stuck up-
right in the ground and trained about it
was the sweet briar whose floral motto
reads  wound to heal

  the meeting dealt with josiah pat-
ton as it did with several of its mem-
bers for taking up arms in violation
of the testimony of friends and sent a
committee to wait upon him

  he rested his case upon a single de-
fense 

  people who live in glass-houses should
not throw stones

  the committee reported itself as sat-
isfied

  during after years on first days and
fifth days josiah and lydia had looked
across the meeting-house yard and given
each other loving eye greeting the long
rows of low white head-stones within the
burial section recorded the names of
many who were most active in the sep-
aration among them the parents of jo-
siah and lydia

  in the meeting-house although the
board partition was still between the fac-
tions the rancor had greatly subsided
in the partition there was a small door
fitting closely without moulding knob
or latch to mark it it was fastened by
an old-fashioned lock no one could re-
member having seen the key no one had
ever explained the presence of the door
save by the custom of having a similar
door in the swinging partitions of coun-
try schoolhouses the building carpenter
had followed the custom in partitions

  on a may morning lydia ashmead
with more color upon her fair cheeks
than usual with happy promise love-
blended in her brown eyes added to her
usual daily greeting

  the way will open soon josiah
watch for it the heavenly father hath
shown it to me

  josiah pondered over her words sud-
denly a great light shone in his face he
walked to his home with that determina-
tion upon it which in war-times had set
it firm for charge or battle

  on fifth day morning he took his
seat in meeting with his accustomed
calm after eyeing the partition door
steadily for a moment he smiled then
settled himself for silent communion
there was a slight rustle upon the loose-
ly cushioned wooden seats and a slow
turning of hats and bonnets when he rose
and walked to the door in the partition

  without hesitation or difficulty he
lifted it from its place the lock-bolt
drew from its socket he set the door to
one side and stood at its opening the
surprise was great but the suppressed
excitement was greater when lydia ash-
mead quietly left her seat in the other
meeting and took stand by his side with-
in it thus they stood facing the meet-
ings for five minutes ignoring all but an
inner consciousness

  josiah turned to lydia took her of-
fered hand in tone round with love ai 
solemnity he said 

  in the presence ol the lord and this
assembly  take thee lydia ashmead t
be my wife promising with divine as-
sistance to be unto thee a loving and
faithful husband until death shall sepa-
rate us

  lydia turned to him the same sweet
face he had loved for over three score
years now lighted with the dignity of a
righteous act and clearly repeated the
same words substituting josiahs name
for her own and wife for husband
josiah unbuttoned his coat took from
under it a broad parchment browned by
the years of its waiting upon which were
inscribed the words of the marriage-cer-
emony after the manner of the society
of friends from convenient pockets he
brought an inkstand and pen upon the
back of an empty seat they signed it ly-
dia as lydia patton josiah filled in the
date

  the ceremony was complete josiah
handed lydia the signed certificate aft-
erward there was not a person present
in either meeting who did not in full joy
and willingness sign as witness

  lydia quietly resumed her seat josiah
went to his own after a short silence
friends in the gallery shook hands and
meeting broke

  in the yard lydia joined her husband
upon the spot where long before they had
sealed their pledge with a parting-kiss
many crossed the dividing line for the
first time since the separation to speak
to bride and groom and in the general
good feeling to mingle in amity as
friends of old

  arm in ami josiah and lydia walked
down the street a rosy quaker lass made
merry by the similitude called them
the sparrows the sobriquet flew
voiced in affectionate admiration and
heart-felt relief

  at lydias door she turned to him
beaming with happiness and asked 

  is it well with thee josiah will
thee walk in

  it is well with me lydia thee is
fairer and dearer to me than ever i will
enter
sandstorm and the black hand 

  lydia asked josiah in an after talk
i have a concern upon my mind to know
who took the screws from the hinges of
the partition-door and eased it so that
it might he readily lifted out

  tvdia laughed then demurely let fall
her eyes

  josiah if thee will go up-stairs to
our room and look in the front right-
hand corner of the upper drawer in my
bureau thee will find a small box la-
beled how the way was opened
and thee will find that it contains the
screws

the rei book magazine

  didnt i read that hig huskies were
employed in the subway to collect pas-
sengers by the ears and hurl them into
the cars through windows and doors ves
 did so i stood for three hours on the
platform of a tunnel express-station
waiting for one of the hurleys to lay a
hand on me no  wasnt going to shoot
him i thought a tap or two on the back
of the neck with the butt of a  would
jar a little manners into him if he got
fussy  was as close as  could get to a
party in uniform with a megaphone-
voice standing almost on his shoes in an
inviting attitude

  but scalping piutes he was as mild
as custard pie and said please and
ves sir and ves madam as pretty as
a floorwalker

  also i rode in the cars where they
told me the guards clubbed folk into
their seats or strapped em to the roof
like sides of bacon huh why i sat
close to the door laying for a big red-
whiskered cuss with a cross-eye and jut-
ting-out jaw was just itching to have
him start something did he ves he did
not he was one of those overgrown
butter-mouths and spoke like a blunt-
needled phonograph

   now gentlemen kindly dont
crowd be nice now and dont push step
a little forward please so i can open
the gates jim it was disgusting con-
sidering what i had anticipated if men
had walked over me the way they did
over that mealy-tongued cyclops id have
dissected them down to a shin-bone

  then id read about the possibilities
of the tube-expresses running off the
track and killing thousands of people
well i rode about eighty miles and the
smooth easy motion of the train put me
to sleep theres a three-legged mule in
rampage thats got more danger in her
in a minute than those trains will develop
in a century theres not a man alive dare
ride on or behind that mule notwith-
standing her one impotent fin more
than six seconds with his eyes shut sev-
eral good men have tried it and the cor-
oners jury always returned the same
verdict inattention as to mary janes
disposition

  jim its an outrage-the stories that

go out to the innocent believin west
since  was as tall as a gopher ive had
it dinned into me that the bowery was
one of the wildest wickedest most sinful
streets in the world beginning at baxter
street where the stories and pictures
show giants sluggin people in dark al-
leys and chinamen swinging hatchets up
along to steve brodies and eat-em-
alive-jacks my mind had formed a pic-
ture of disorder and riot so when  set
out i packed three guns and a set of
brass-knuckles

  it fair makes me weep to recall it-
three guns and brass-knuckles what i
needed was a feather fan and a bottle of
cologne first i tackled baxter street
with the tails of both eyes skinned and
my fists on my batteries oh yes there
were bad men there all right the first
was a big young chap with an undershot
jaw and curly hair i halted and waited
for him to attack me nothing doing
so i stuck out my chin and said boo

  under an awning of the next shop
was a doddering old man whos been
cheating the undertaker these many
years then on for half a block i passed
a lot more who would shiver with fear if
small boys made faces at them

  all this was mighty irritating when
i was looking for trouble w ith a search-
light but thinking of steve brodies i
perked up though id read he was dead
i expected to see the old place overflow-
ing with the bad men of the bowery
smarting like untamed zulus for a scrap
and what did i find nothing but a
pink-whiskered bartender with a soft
voice and a salvation army girl collect-
ing nickels in a little tin box

  i was so plumb sore and disappointed
i tried to get a rise out of that mixer by
insulting his whiskers remarking that
they reminded me of the tail of a cat the
boys had dyed red one fourth of july
and that six months after had faded a
streaky pink

  did he foam did he reach for me
with a sandbag and w-histle for the gang
in the rear room nay jim nay he
leaned his elbows on the bar smiled
pleasantly and said 

   how amusing how curious the cat
must have looked


yt

carmelita

  then i hunted up the place id heard
called suicide hall thinking to see men
and women carrying in carboys of acid
and drinking it expecting to find the at-
mosphere thick with gun-smoke bubbles
of gold but i was the untutored cub
i found a volunteer of america in a neat
gray uniform delivering an armful of
tracts and singing hymns for the edifica-
tion of a dopy-looking butchers boy who
was dissipating horribly with a tumbler
of sarsaparilla besides him the only hu-
man biped in the place excepting a pair
of sad-eyed waiters was a collar-button
peddler operating on a stein of beer so
as not to lose the foam do you blame
me for glooming

  somehow hope continued stubborn
and  made the round of the dime muse-
ums shocking i saw a fat girl who shed

little clouds of sawdust every time she
took a breath  a three-legged boy whose
third leg squeaked on a rusty hinge and
a mermaid with a misfit fin

  at last i boarded a cab and told the
driver to go as far as he liked and as fast
as he knew how thinking the horse might
run away or an auto wing us whose
choffer would be mobbed by a frenzied
crowd into which i should plunge hero-
ically and rescue him what happened
we hadnt gone six blocks before an
anti-cruelty society officer stopped us
and declared our pegasus an hapless dcr-
elict fit only to pasture in pleasant fields
of clover

  i tried a second cab and really got a
little excitement out of it when my
charioteer tried to charge me  for an
hours run i tickled his ribs with my


the red book magazine

gun and argued with him hut he was
another spineless metropolitan and be-
came a calm and floppy as a jelly-fish
begging my pardon in three dialects and
weeping about his wife and eighteen
children

  the limit had been reached  gave
up thrill-hunting then and there jim
this town is hard-boiled im going to
check my kick back to rampage where
theres still a little life left for were

  sandstorm jones fell silent and gazed
wistfully out of the window across ten
thousand roofs and the shimmering wa-
ters of the hudson

  its a whale of a town he said soft-
iv half to himself but not what its
cracked up to be in thrills and shudders
dont give up yet sandy laughed
his cousin turning again to the ticker
take a whirl off the beaten paths a
deal happens down behind those roofs
where nobody goes but those who dwell
under them-a lot that the argus-eyed
newspapers never see and the rest of the
world never dreams of

  a few days later as jim jones was
ruefully estimating the damage done to
his finances by the recent slump a tad of
a messenger-boy burst in upon him and
thrust a letter under his nose he spread
the missive out before him and read the
following message written in a stiff fem-
inine hand 

  deak jim

          thanks to the beautiful young
  woman who is slaving away her life in
  this human rcpriir-shop i am able to
  acquaint you with the fact that i am in
  ward p of the harlem hospital run
  up and give me a peep when you get a
  chance

                                   y mis

sandstorm

  as fast as an electrii-hansom could
take him young mr jones made the
journey to the hospital he was ushered

into ward b by the beautiful young
woman and directed down a long aisle
of cots to no  he halted before uu
bed and lor a moment sought vainly to
identify its occupant all he could see
was a long uneven mound beneath the
coverlet and resting on the pillow was
what at first appeared a huge golf-ball
wound in white tape

   hello jim  came to him in smoth-
ered sepulchral tones

  in a hash jim made out an eye spark-
ling through an interstice in the band-
ages which he felt could be none other
than the steady brilliant orb of his
cousin no other feature was distinct but
where the mouth should have been was a
narrow slit through which the voice had
fluttered to him

  pull up a chair and sit down jim
continued the hoarse distant voice ill
tell you how i happen to be here

  that afternoon when you suggested
that  yaw a little off the big trails 
steered for the deep east side of harlem
it sure swarms i trekked around through
divers and various colonies listening to
as many foreign languages as you get in
a cooks tour until finally i hove into
spaghetti flat and shaped my course
along noodle alley it was hard not to
step on the little greasers that rioted
about my legs-big-eyed little chaps
with piping voices in which you now and
then make out an american cuss-word

  i tossed them a handful of coppers
with powerful results the word
throbbed round that a dago santa claus
was in l ittle italys midst hambinos
came down the fire-escapes and belched
from the doorways like ants scrambling
to a bug-funeral women stuck their
heads out of windows and smiled till the
air was dizzy with teeth

  sandstorm jones was being suffo-
cated by leaping and climbing brown
babies and looked wildly around for an
angle of escape spying a little shop
draped with macaroni and strings of gar-
lic i sidled into it and dodged the ava-
lanche of kids i shut the door on them
and after a bit they melted away

  then i looked about the slit of a
shop and my gaze fell upon as handsome
a pair of black eyes as the lord ever put
sandstorm and the black hand 

in a pretty face and talk about pearls-
there never were any precious pebbles
that coukl shine beside those rows of lit-
tle teeth she was smiling on me too
dont forget that and  felt silly down to
my toes and blushed a flamingo-tint 
stood there tongue-tied looking as fool-
ish as an angora goat after a breakfast
of rail road-iron

  while i was looping up my belt to
get a pose in blows a black-whiskered
little bandit he was there with the jet-
tatura and turned the gleam of one of
his bad little lamps on the girl she
shrunk back as if he had hit her in the

when  saw a big misty tear roll down
from one of those black eyes i just
picked up the little pirate with a grip
just about the mid-ribs and passed him
through the door into the middle of the
street he rolled over and over several
times and then scrambled up turning
to the shop he shook his fists in the air
and foamed a little then he scudded
away into a red brick hive

  i thought the girl would be pleased
but she wasnt she wrung her hands and
sniffled she told me to run for my life
that  had only a minute the gang
would be after me with their needle-

i went through that bunch like a sand-spout

face when he began to pour a flood of
loose-labial italian at her naturally 
grew hot all the way up to the ears and
felt around in my pockets for the artil-
lery i touched the little brigand  the
shoulder and said

  copper that son or youll be served
with a lead-numbered deuce in lessn twro
seconds

  he shook off my hand with a snarl
as if hed bite and went right on with his
browbeating i learned later he was try-
ing to blackmail her into giving him
money i could hear him saying with a
nasty emphasis mono nero and com-

morixi

  but i didnt wait for any diagram

knives and blue-nosed guns laughing
i patted her hand which was trembling
on the counter but she was right for
looking out of the door i saw a flock of
dusky mustached little men rushing
across the cobbles frisking stilettoes out
of their pockets and waving their nickel-
plated pop-guns in the air

  well jim here was one grand
chance for sandstorm jones of ram-
page utah to show his mettle so i un-
limbered my ordnance and bounded out
into the street emitting a good old wild
and wooly whoop letting one gun go off
in the air i used the other as a club i
went through that bunch of wicked pig-
mies like a sand-spout through a cluster
o

the red book magazine

of dead sage-brush and those i didnt
slam good and proper winged away to

their caves except for a few asleep on
the pavement the full band had vanished

in six tick leaving the woinen-folk to
come out and gather up the slumberers
they were just out not dead you know

   that little mix-up was surely a treat
my somber cousin and when  went back
to the hotel after trying to comfort miss
black eyes new york began to look
promising

  but honest jim  couldnt get any
sleep that night for a pair of black eyes
with a tear in them kept roaming through
the shadows making me feel strange
nervous chills id never felt before
twas the same the next night and feel-
ing the call of noodle alley mighty
strong i ambled back to her shop

   at the head of the street i faced up
against the little brigand me had a rare
patch over his right eye and a mile or so
of bandages about the top of his head
he jumped out of my way as if hed
stepped on a row of sword-points i went
along smiling but after the evil look he
gave me the grip of my  felt cool and
pleasant

   she was there behind the counter all
right all righty and the smile she gave
me was the most refreshing thing id
seen since  opened the rainbow pocket
in chloride gulch your esteemed cousin
smiled a few himself and we were hav-
ing the rarest kind of a little confab she
going around from box to box showing
me funny shaped noodles big and little

onions macaroni and spaghetti in twenty
different shapes and sizes and scarlet
peppers as big as dwarf-pumpkins  es
we were just having as cosy a little chat
as ever was when something happened

    i didn t know what until some brief
time after when  opened one eye and
looked up into the classic countenance
of a young surgeon all around were
pieces of wreckage-glass wood spa-
ghetti onions a section of counter little
mounds of brick and plaster there were
policemen moving about and reporters
asking breathless questions as fragmen
tary things began to shape themselves in
my mind i addressed the surgeon 

   say pal what came off said i

   bomb he replied and went on
stitching and patching

   and her  added choking up

   oh shes all right he said smil-
ing some of her black tresses singed
but otherwise hardly scratched you got
the most of it and sort of shielded her
when you came back here with the shop
say jim whispered sandstorm
jones after a brief pause shes been
here twice

  who asked jim who was a trifle
dazed by the strange narrative

  who carmelita you chump 
  carmelita 

  yes carmelita when i knit together
and get my features out of this cordage
shes going back to rampage with me
were going to be married here in the
hospital to-morrow and i want you on
the job as best man

the magnetic eerie quality in miss
maude adams personality so sim-
ple and unaffected and yet so potent in
its charm which has endeared her to the
thousands throughout this broad land
who admire purity and delicacy on the
stage and which has endured with un-
diminished beauty through the wear and
tear of the eighteen years since in the
midnight bell she took her first timid
step into the coveted circle of celebrities
of the drama asserts itself again and
with all its peculiar force in the jes-
ters her latest play

   do not intend to go into the details
of miguel zamaois poetic but fragile
little play to do so would be like pull-
ing apart a rose to find its perfume sarah
bernhardt first acted it in paris then
john raphael translated it into rhymed
hexameters of not very superior grace
and chicot at length found lodgment in
miss adams gallery of parts it is not a
drama that will be greatly admired i
suspect by those who want acting by the
yard or pound  but it will be loved by all
who appreciate beauty and who under-
stand the thin veneer of histrionic clap-
trap that often passes for acting

  one thing the play surely do-s it re-
veals miss adams art in a clearer and
mellower aspect than ever before it
shows how marked has been her advance-
ment as an elocutionist and how subtle
have become the touches with which she
builds up character miss adams has not
only been playing peter pan during the
last three years  she has been assimilat-
ing peter pans spirituality

  the scene of the jesters is a
mouldy crumbling feudal castle of the
middle ages in france where dwells the
baron ce mautpre impoverished but
proud and struggling to keep up a pre-
tense of his former wealth his retainers
a noisy swaggering crew are clamoring
for their pay and only oliver his faith-
ful major-domo remains loyal solange
the barons beautiful daughter has ar-
rived at that romantic age when young
girls yearn to love for the mere sake of
loving she does not know of her familys
poverty she cannot understand the
troubled mood which oppresses her fath-
er but oliver makes a sacrifice which
brings about peace for a time he pays
the wages of the swaggering italian
bravo iulcano out of his own slender

savings and with his tale of hidden
treasure within the castle which is soon
to be found harmony is restored

  for all however hut solange a sor-
row oppresses her her heart yearns tor
something all unknown she turns to her
books and reads to oliver the lines

   tis john the jesters tale who ly his
       capers wild

   gladdened king phillips court until in
       love he fell

  a jester here would make-were we hut
      rich

  a happy thought strikes oliver he
will persuade the baron to procure a jes-
ter to win solange hack to happiness

  about this time three peddlers visit
the castle one is a merchant but the
other two are noble youths in disguise
who have had a glimpse of solange and
have fallen in love with her at sight
one robert de belfonte fair-haired and
fine of limb is determined to win her by
his grace  the other rene de chanccnae
iuick of mind and keen of tongue will
try to woo her by his wit

  these young gallants learn of olivers
project and depart hut as narcissus and
chicot they soon return with a crew of
motley buffoons in answer to the call for
jesters a contest is arranged which will
last a month at the end solange is to de-
cide which shall be the successful candi-
date for jester of her court

  the fateful day arrives and all the
contestants are summoned and bidden to
extemporize on the breeze jack pud-
ding the country lout fails baroco the
swaggering florentine gets drunk hi-
larius the funereal misanthrope moves
his audience not to mirth but tears nar-
cissus moulds his verse to glorify his
physical grace

  then comes chicots turn the poem
which miss adams recites marks the
point of highest interest in the play it is
a fancy as delicate as a butterflys wing
but up this gossamer web she mounts to
heights of true poetic fervor the breeze
is personified as a lover who careening
around the earth comes upon a maid sit-
ting upon the battlement of a castle he
returns again and again to woo her
bringing the perfume of flowers and new-
rnown hay fanning her cheek and ca-
ressing her golden hair


-sady hawsoninovjral-

  but one day when he comes he finds a
human lover by the maids side then he
rushes off in jealous rage hurling him-
self against the castle walls and turning
the marriage-bells to funeral knells at
last in despair he goes away to carry de-
struction over the earth for three years
there comes a day when he steals back
to find his lost love sitting on the battle-
ment tending her baby ii is heart is soft
ened and returning to his gentlest mood
he softly rocks the cradle in which the
sleeping infant lies

  with his poem chicot wins the victory
and presently he captures solan gr s
heart then he pays the barons debts
and restores the castle thus the story
ends as happily as a beautiful fairy tale
should

  it is hard to find at any time in the
theatre a play which is so pure in its
fancy or so delicate in its unfolding and
i cannot recall another actress who could
impart to the role of chicot the poetic
fervor charm and beauty which miss

adams lends to it with so little apparent
effort i admit the frailty of the play but
with most other theatre-goers i revel in
its refreshing spirit

  queerly enough the biggest laughing
hit of the dramatic season in new york
is tom taylors old ramshackle  ur
american cousin which laura keene
produced for the enjoyment of theatre-
goers just half-a-century ago and out of
which edward a sothern evolved the
celebrated character of lord dundreary
which afterwards became the corner-
stone of his fame the lisping lord with
the piccadilly weepers vacuous stare
funny little hop-step and asinine density
of intellect still remains in the sothern
family for it was recently the happy
thought of edward h sothern to bring
the famous progenitor of all the stage
silly-asses of two generations back to
life

dundreary is the
living image ol the old it reveals mr
sotheru in his most brittle comedy-vein
and if his audiences had their way they
would not allow him to depart from the
iyric theatre until the close of the sea-
son

  i wont attempt to tell the story of
our american cousin indeed i
couldnt with all the rest my mind on
the first night was too much absorbed
with dundreary to tax itself with such a
small matter as a plot vet i must add
in passing that it is the humor not the
intended pathos of this old play which
has survived the ravages of time thus is
the usual experience both of narrative
and dramatic literature reversed

   in the first act dundreary visiting at
the country-home of sir edward rcn-
ciard his uncle is introduced with song
the second act brings about his midnight
meditations which are rudely interrupted
by the impromptu pistol-practice of his
cousin from america isa trenchard
the third act reveals him as a lover and
portrays him in his rambling proposal of
marriage to the unresponsive georgiana
in the dairy-yard in the final act takes
place his side-splitting reading of broth-
er sants letter where is the playwright
now who can make audiences laugh until
they weep

  now for one serious comment if this
monument of astounding mental vacuity
were not every inch a good fellow if his
virtues were not as many as his absurd-
ities are great if he were not a perfect
gentleman as well as a perfect fool he



would never have

  with the recent production by miss
viola allen of irene wycherley a new
dramatist of quite unusual promise has
come into view he is anthony p whar-
ton an instructor in dublin university
and his first play written for miss lena
ash well the english emotional actress
who carried it to much success in lon-
don shows that he has a divination of
character a sense of dramatic propor-
tion and a literary fluency which with a
little more experience should carry him
far toward the goal of his ambition

  the plot of irene wycherley is de-
veloped along the three sides of the fa-
miliar sexual triangle the problem it
raises bears upon the obligation of a
wife bound by the tenets of the catholic
church to an unhappy marriage with a
husband who has been proved in every
way unworthy of her respect or love
after stating the issue squarely and
showing the wreck of happiness which
must result from such religious scruples

tion by bringing about the death of the
offending husband but in the meantime
he has created some effective situations
which open the way to much fine acting

   when the curtain rises irrn the wife
has been living for six years apart from
her husband whose cruelties it appears
have culminated in a personal assault
she has the sympathy of his family who
nevertheless are anxious that a reunion
be brought about partly that an heir to
the family may be made possible irene
has resisted vigorously and meanwhile
has found in harry chesterton a friend
of her youth a man who measures up to
all her high ideals of masculine nobility
yet she resolutely blocks his ill-concealed
attachment

  presently word comes to her that the
unworthy wycherley has been blinded
and horribly disfigured in a shooting-ac-
cident casting her hatred aside irene
goes to his aid she finds that affliction
has only intensified the mans petulant

disposition and evil nature he brutally
repels her attentions until brought to a
realization of his utter helplessness sud-
denly changes his attitude promises
amends and begs that the honeymoon
begin again the wife submits to his ca-
resses in silence she even smothers her
disgust when his fingers detect the scar
upon her face left by the lash of his rid-
ing-whip but when she becomes con-
scious of the carnal passion which lies
behind his caresses she can no longer hide
her revulsion

  the husband newly enraged decides
upon a crowning indignity there is a
mrs cave who at one time had been in
his life but who having subsequently
married charles summers in south af-
rica is unknown to irene it was while
hunting with summers that wycherley
received the gunshot wound which
caused his blindness and now it is in-
timated to the audience that the occur-
rence was not an accident as first


photo by hallny

supposed but summers willful act on
discovering his wife kissing her old par-
amour

  circumstances in the final act conspire
to make mrs summers identity known
to irene this brings about a strong
scene in which the wife orders her from
the house summers naturally resenting
the summary dismissal makes a heated
demand for an explanation only to be
brought face to face with the story of his
wifes immoral past two pistol shots
presently sound from an adjoining room
the unhappy husband has taken both
wycherleys life and his own

  as this brief outline contains only the
essential facts of the drama it makes the
story seem more bitter than it really is
much of the embroidery of subsidiary
incidents is light and interesting some
of the minor characters are sketched
with excellent satirical effect the piece
on the whole has power to move the sym-
pathies and hold the interest though it
deals largely with immoralities its un-
dertone is highly moral from any point
of view it is a decidedly remarkable
piece of writing

  miss viola allen has not often been
seen to better advantage than in the role
of irene there is a ring of conviction in
her expressions of emotion and the harsh
note so often noticeable in her acting
has quite disappeared edwin arden by

his exaggeration of the physical disfig-
urement of wycherley injects an un-
necessarily repellant note into the play
gives otherwise a performance that is
effective a dozen more express with fi
delity all that their parts contain inus-
ually solid and handsome are the settings

of tile three scenes

  when adeline iciiee recently left
england the staid old london times
protesting hotly against her going re-
marked that her slippers should be pre-
served in the british museum at an
earlier time its critic wrote if  could
dance a criticism of ienee i might do
her justice unfortunately one cannot
dance a criticism vet after all there is
no need of criticism

  such is the fame which this rival of
terpsichore and reigning queen of the
dance enjoys in london where she has
been literally worshiped for ten years

  and now in new york where the art
of the dance has been all but lost for
three-quarters of a generation but where
memories of morlacchi and b on f anti and
ka hi lenner and emily and betti kigl
still endure adeline jenee has set up a
new kingdom over-night to reign over as
she wills

  no one except celebrities of grand
opera has created a greater furore than
did this amazing fluff-ball of femininity
who touches only the high places in her
flight when she made her debut in the
soul kiss a few nights ago poising like
a fairy on a sunbeam winging about the
stage like a hummingbird above a honey-
suckle blossom bringing with her the
bubbles buoyant freedom and the larks
exultant joy of living she produced an
effect that words can scarcely describe
perfection such as hers resists all at-

tempts at comparison with other dancers
df the present day dwarfs the agile fig-
ures that glide in memories of the past
and lifts her high and apart into a class
by herself

  the greater pity it is therefore that
this genius should have been placed in a
setting of garish extravaganza and vul-
gar vaudeviilians which can only inspire
lisgust if florenz ziegfeld jr who de-
vised the show aspired to create a sensa-
tion he overshot his mark those to
whom his powder-encrusted half-naked
show-girls leather-lunged clowns and
prancing voryphees will appeal are not
the ones whose opinions an artiste of
lenees caliber will he likely to value

  tens of thousands of fiddles which
have been vibrating unceasingly through
the last six months with the waltz-song
from the merry widow may now
vary the monotony by scraping out loves
roundelay from a waltz dream

  for a waltz dream has come from
vienna-where in fact all the waltzes
worth while come from-to new york
where it is dogging the footsteps of the
merrv widow and rolling up a wonder-
ful popularity for itself

  the principal disadvantage which a
waltz dream suffers from the merry
widow is that it was the last to arrive
on the ground its melodies are just as
languorous and enticing the wait-song
which makes its fame is just as beautiful
and i am inclined to think that the whole
score would bear quite as close critical
inspection yet i doubt if oscat straus
would have written it had not the success
of franz lehars piece furnished the
idea and incentive

meatless dishes with the meat flavor
for lenten season days

by mary jane mcclure

r ri l all mud and slosh
  underfoot and
  owning weeping
  skies overhead pre-
  sents a somber set-
  ting ior the season
  of sackcloth and
  ashes fasting and
  penance would not
  be bugbears if the
  forty days of lent

fell in midsummer

when skies are bright and gush of
a	hud-song and fragrance of flower

r r lr	distract the rnind from such a ma-

terial thing as longing for a good
f i	square meal--and meat but fall-

	ing as it does in the spongy month the lime of

retirement from frills and frivolity and roast beef
	is doubly hard to bear

it requires a stronger character than is pos-
sessed by the average mortal to deliberately
put aside meat for forty days without com-
promising in some way nature and training force the stom-
ach to cry out in an insistent demand for  the fleshpots of
egypt some sort of a crutch is required upon which to
lean in moments of weakness put something into the stom-
ach that tastes like the food it is crav-
ing and it quits crying and goes to
sleep like a satisfied baby by taking
advantage of this propensity it will be
possible to slip through the lenten
season without much discomfort or
effort at self-denial

  no better compromise could be im-
agined at this juncture than armours
extract of beef with its help substantial meatless dishes
may be prepared with the rich flavor of roast beef as well as
tasty tit-biu that may be eaten without the slightest qualm of
conscience

  the possibilities contained in the tiny jar of armours ex-
tract of beef are limited only by the ingenuity originality and
daring of the cook and the ingredients at hand all the
	-a	delicious juices of

rich red lean beef
are concentrated in an
a	aromatic savory es-

scnce delicately sen-
soned and full of pal-

properties

  in buying beef extract it is necessary to specify armours
if you want the best most other brands not only are lacking
in quality but they contain a certain percentage of water
which makes it necessary o use in some cases four times as

trout with

  much as would be required if armours was employed for
  this reason while other brands at first sight may appear to be
  less expensive armours in the long run is the cheapest be-
  cause only about a quarter as much of it will be needed to
  produce the same results and thus it will last four time as
  long as the  bargain  brand

do you realize

      in the poison cupboard of the drug store caffeine the alkaloid from
coffee and tea is alongside of cocaine morphine strychnine etc

      this drug put in coffee by nature may be alright as a medicine when
skillfully handled by a physician but was never intended to be used as a beverage

      in many persons this constant drugging sets up disease-such as nervous-
ness indigestion weak eyes palpitation liver and kidney troubles etc you may
be sure a day of reckoning will come when ailments become chronic

       if there are signs of trouble in you and if you care to feel again the old-
time go of physical and mental poise-the luxury of being perfectly well-try

income oriooo

secured by small monthly payments
the less money you have the greater is the need to place it where it will
work hard and fast for you

     if you can save five to twenty-five dollars per month for a few mouths here is the fairest and best safeguarded and most
practical plan ever offered you to make these savings produce an assured income and remember your money goes into real
estate the foundation of all values the lecogmzed measure of all conservative securities

     we are developing a thousand acres of fertile land to a product which possesses an enormous capacity for profit-making
and we are offering to you an interest in this investment which will increase enoimously in value and will bring you a splendid
annual income	j	 y-

     bearing peach orchards are worth  to   an acre why because an acre of elberta peaches will net
its owner  loooo a year let us send you the written testimony of many conservative bankers more than corroborating these
figures we can prove them absolutely

     the locations in which peaches grow and fruit to perfection are limited and this is one of the reasons why they pay so
enormously insuch locations our land is in one of those rare locations where the soil and climate conditions are just right and
where the trees are loaded year after year to the breaking point with luscious fruit bunging the highest market price

     there is nothing about the following figures that you cannot understand or verify  peach trees to the acre one
bushel to the tree at   per bushel means   per acre less than  of this will care for the acre and all expenses
of harvest you may until the present series of  shares is sold secure these shares each representing an undivided acre of
developed orchard for only   of your own money paid in small installments of but  per month the profits
from this acre should average  or more a year is this not worth investigating

     there is already a splendid orchard of  peach trees on our property

we prove every statement

write for our plan and make your own investigation dothis-do it now it costs you nothing look up our officers and
directors you will not find their names used for ornamental purposes but you will find them to be men who know their busi-
ness who are accustomed to earning their money by delivering the goods-all men whom you can very easily find out about

     dont take our word for these things look us up start now upon the road to success and at a pace that will make
saving a greater pleasure than spending let us show you what  per month will do for you

ten of these shares will at maturity yield you a sure and
certain annual income of one thousand dollars

only a few shares

     there are only one thousand of our shares altogether and they are selling above par right now you pay one-half
the cost of these shares out of your own money the rest is earned by the property itself and more
every dollar you pay is deposited with a responsible trust company which acts as trustee and this money is all used for
development of the investment and for nothing else

     not a dollar of the money you pay in is a profit to us and no one gets a profit until you do it is only by making
the investment profitable to you that we can make any profit the men who make you this offer are practical hard-headed
business men who own large interests in this same line and have received and are now receiving large profits from
them we would like to give you bank references

safeguards

     every possible safeguard surrounds this investment a responsible and well-known trust company holds title to ihe
property as trustee we deposit wth them the money you pay to us and we are compelled to file with them sworn state-
ments as to the development of the property look up this trust company you are fully protected from loss in case
of death and you are given a suspension of payments if desired examine into our safeguards

you may not be able to earn it

the purest figure in his-

fect citizen-a just and righteous
ruler and a light for after time
this commanding personality
had a magnificent physique he
stood over six feet in his stockings
was remarkable for horsemanship
agility and strength - the finest
gentleman and athlete of his day

 his constitution was of iron and
he knew how to keep it so his
biographers declare that in eating
and in drinking as in all things he
was normal enjoying the juice of
the malt all the days of his life
he drank it around campfires as
well as in his own home and upon
social and state occasions

 furthermore upon his mount
vernon plantation he had a brew
house as was the regular custom
of wealthy virginians

otherwise soon be washed or worn off

 weather beaten front doors are revived
and beautified when coated with jap-a-lac and
newness follows the brush it is best to use the
color nearest that of the old finish

window and door screens should be coated
with jap-a-lac each spring using the brilliant black
on the wire and the mahogany oak cherry or
alnut on the frames it gives them new life and
the wire cloth is protected from rust

 porch furniture should be protected
and beautified each spring with jap-a-lac it is best
to use the color of the old finish but if you wish to
chance the color use red or green jap-a-lac

  jap-a-lac is a household necessity and can
be used in a hundred and one ways from cellar
to garret and is especially adapted for finishing

     for example the motor shaft and bearings are usually reached by remov-
ing the lower half of the crank case this necessitates the removal of the boot
or mud apron under the motor a tedious and unpleasant job

     the rambler crank case is not built that way the entire side is remov-
able leaving an opening x inches that affords ample access to the entire
crank shaft and cam mechanism without removal of or interference with any

 spent for automobiles
in 

  from the statistics prepared by the
association of licensed automobile
manufacturers it is learned that over
 was spent for pleasure au-
tomobiles in the united states in the
year ended december   the fig-
ures are divided as follows american
manufactured machines- gaso-
line-cars costing  
steam and electric-cars costing -

	 total of  cars cost -
 in addition there were 
imported cars costing including duty
s the grand total for the year is
 cars aggregate cost -
 there has been a steady increase in
the growth of the industry each year
since  when the total output of cars
was valued at 

  the figures relating to the number of
people employed in the automobile in-
dustry and the amount -of capital in-
vested in the business are also of great
interest the total number directly em-
ployed in the manufacture of cars was
 and the total capital invested
 in the manufacture of such
products as tires rims lamps speed-
ometers drop-forgings and other sun-
dries closely allied to the manufacture of
the vehicles there was a total capital in-
vestment of  and  peo-
ple were employed therein

  unlike many other manufactured
products the sales-end of the automobile
industry is exceedingly expensive at
the close of  there were  sales
and garage establishments employing
 people with a capital of -

	invested this includes real es-
tate rentals insurance bonds and inter-

est charges the total capital employed
is therefore  and the ag-
gregate number of employes 

a falling off in importations

  the year  shows a material de-
crease below  in the number and val-
ue of the cars imported into the united
states whether the american people are
coming to realize that domestic cars are
as good if not better than the imported
vehicles or that after paying nearly
 ad valorem duty in the past
six years a doubt has arisen t-hat they
may or may not have received an equi-
valent return in the quality of the cars
is yet to be determined

  in  there were imported 
new cars which were dutiable and 
used and second-hand cars on which no
duty was paid a total of  cars as
against  for  or a decrease of
 cars the value of the  cars im-
ported in  was as against
 for  a decrease of -
 these figures do not however
included taxicabs and busses as up to the
first of january there were  taxicabs
 busses and one amphibious au-
tomobile imported the latter being bond-
ed against its return of the  cars
brought into this country last year one
company imported  another  and
the third  leaving  cars or an av-
erage of sixteen cars each to forty-five

manufacturers for the corresponding
years shows the enormous strides being
made by the home-producers in

the cost of ownership

   an important question arising in the
rnintis of prospective owners and often
indeed with the actual owners of an
automobile is the cost of maintenance
many owners who do not look personal-
ly to the up-keep do not realize the
cost and are often at a loss to give details
of the amount spent in this way the
four salient points of the up-keep of a
car are how long will the car last
 hat does it cost to operate it what
is the mileage per gallon of fuel  how
long is the life of the tires

   in the first place a machine in the
hands of a competent driver will give
a great deal more satisfaction at a mini-
mum cost than the same car in the hands
of a less experienced man but some in-
teresting data just compiled shows that
with judicious handling and ordinary
care the amount required to maintain an
automobile is not nearly so great as most
people believe statements and statistics
in the form of affidavits from one hun-
dred and sixtv-one owners and dealers
of single cylinder cars in thirty different
states have been compiled they give the
records of cars that have been used on
all kinds of roads and under all sorts of
conditions

   there was considerable variance in the
mileage obtained-ranging from  to
 miles many cars show over 
miles traveled and nearly fifty per cent
over  miles the total mileage of
the one hundred and sixty-one cars was
 or an average of  miles
to a car

   i he consumption of gasoline was a
point of great interest it was shown that
some oars ran as low as  - miles per
gallon while others covered as high as 
miles per gallon forty per cent of the
number reported over twenty miles per
gallon while the average was a trifle
over  - miles as the price of gaso-
line varies in different parts of the coun-
try the average price of gasoline is
placed at eighteen cents this makes the
average cost of operation one cent per
mile per car for fuel or less than one-
third of a cent per mile per person in
this connection it should be stated that
in the recent economy fuel-test held by

      your home will be healthier when you keep bottled
 schlitz the barley is a food-the hops are a tonic and
 the drinking of liquids flushes the system of waste

      every doctor knows that most people drink too little

  on this account their systems become clogged with waste

       there lies the main good of watering places they induce
  the drinking of water

      that is one reason why the drinking of beer is good
 for ou it leads you to drink more liquid than ou would
 drink without it and that liquid is both a food and a tonic

       the sturdiest peoples of the earth drink the most of it

      but be sure that the beer is aged so it will not cause
  biliousness and be sure it is pure

        schlitz beer is all healthfulness

the long island automobile club the
winning car showed some interesting re-
sults in running  miles with five pas-
sengers it onsumed but thirteen gallons of
gasoline and one and one-quarter quarts of
lubricating oil the total cost allowing
twenty-five cents per gallon for gaso-
line and one dollar per gallon for oil
was  the per capita of expense is
therefore j cents for the total dis-
tance which is cheaper than any other
means of conveyance

  i he cost of repairs ranged from prac-
tically nothing to several hundred dol-
lars the total repairs not including
tires for all the cars was  or
an average for each car of about 
as the average length of time the cars
had been used was one year seven
months and twenty days the average cost
of repairs was  per month or fifty-
one cents per week on the basis of dis-
tance traveled the showing is very low
the one hundred and sixty-one cars have
a total mileage of  miles and
with the total cost of repairs 
the cost of the up-keep averaged 
per mile or in other words only forty-
four and one-quarter cents per one hun-
dred miles traveled this certainly is
cheaper than walking

  the average number of passengers car-
ried on the one hunded and sixty-one

cars was three and one-half persons

making the expense less than thirteen
cents per hundred miles for each pas-
senger

  it was very difficult to arrive at a
basis of the cost of tires owing to the
different road conditions throughout the
country however the reports seem to
be very satisfactory it was found that a
set of tires ran from  to  miles
but the majority seem to show that the
life of the tire was between  and

	miles probably the wear and tear
on the machine due to erratic driving is
more noticeable at the tires than at any
other point

   it certainly is gratifying to find after
a canvass of over one hundred and sixty-
one automobile owners that the up-keep
of a carefully operated car demonstrates
that the cost of transportation per mile
is less by automobile than any other
means of locomotion

 retaining the same strength the guar-
 anteeing of a better quality the stand-
 ardization of sizes and the arrangement for
 letter delivery from steel tube makers
 until this time the theories of many of
 the engineers have been at variance some
 have advocated some particular size and
 thickness while others have had ideas en-
 tirely different while the manufacturers
 of tubing have held still other views

 the situation has therefore been in a cha-
 otic state and necessarily the manufac-
 turers of the tubing as well as the auto-
 mobile manufacturers have been getting
 very unsatisfactory results ft is esti-
 mated that at least twelve hundred sizes
 of steel tubes with varying diameters
 and thicknesses were being used where-
 as if an agreed standard could be
 reached and proper material used this
 number could be reduced to a minimum

   a canvass was made of the engineers
 of the association asking for the maxi-
 mum number of diameters and gauges
 each one needed the data showed that
 instead of over twelve hundred various
 diameters and gauges the maximum
 number required was not over three hun-
 dred thus eliminating the necessity of
 manufacturers carrying the other sizes

actual horse-power

   advanced ideas in construction and
 design have now materially minimized

 the loss of efficiency in the transmission
 of power from motor to rear wheels

  many early experiments showed that
the loss of power due to friction in the
engine was so great that radical changes
in the weight and size of both piston and
rings were necessary then the problem
of conveying to the rear wheels as much
as possible of the power developed in the
engine offered itself he combination
of these deficiencies was a loss of power
from the time it leaves the motor until it
is applied that was lamentable natur-
ally the owner wants to know why he
may be truthfully told that the motor
develops  or  horse-power but when
he is speeding or attempting to climb a
stiff grade and he finds that only  or
 horse-power is delivered at the point
of propulsion he is dissatisfied

  some manufacturers particularly is
it true in the case of the makers of the
rambler have overcome to a large de-
gree this loss of efficiency by the em-
ployment of the straight-line drive that
is by transmitting the power in a direct
line from the crank-shaft to the rear
axle thus avoiding any loss by deflection
the wear due to the use of a univer-
sal joint is minimized by the straight-
line method and not only is the power
exerted at the rear axle greater but the
chances of breaking the joint as a result
of friction is almost eliminated

distinctive features described

 how orangeine dispels pain and ailment
   takes the place of opiates with oniy
   beneficial results

                memphis texv jam  

   i am afflicted with an obscure pain in my
 side which physicians in new york boston and
 memphis have failed to find the cause of when
 i call physicians in extreme pain they give me
 quieting powders i tell them not to give me
 morphine and they promise not to but i can
 read on the prescription mopii and opium
 makes me feel as morphine does with all its
 after-effects

   during the past years i have taken a great
 deal of orangeine which quiets my pain with-
 out anybad after-effects i reserveit expressly
 for pain of courseif i have acold or a tend
 ency to grip i take as many as six powders
 a day i have done that ever since it came out
 but that is only maybe once in a winter it is
 marvelous for that

    if i lose orangeine i am bereft fer it does
 not wear out and nothing i have found is so
 good i simply cannot take doctors opiates
 and the moderate use of oranjjeine keeps me
 comfortable and as above expressed i cannot
 see any bad after-effects

crias h trrtkkll m l

   my dear sir about two months ago i was induced oy a friend
in this office to purchase one of your j b l cascades i have
been a sufferer aimcwt all my life from constipation in an aggravat-
ed form and have never been able to obtain any permanent relief
i was exceedingly skeptical about your proposition and it was with
treat indifference that i nave it a trial the result has been little
short of amazing tt has practically made a new man of me and
has given me the relief  had been looking fur for years

   money could not purchase the cascade i own if it could not be
duplicated

   i have taken pleasure in recommending the cascade to a num-
ber of my friends and will continue t- recommend it

   it gives me great pleasure to write this little note of grateful
appreciation	yours very truly

         signed	javtd b lee

   it is known thatkr of all disease arises from the retention
of foreign matter in the human system also that the greatest
parr of this waste is held in the colon hence the flushing
of this ora-an the main drain of the body removes the first
and greatest cause of disease while immeasurably the best
treatment for constipation and stomach trouble tnere is
scarcely any known disease for which the j b l cascade
may not he confidently prescribed it is so perfectly natural
in its action that it induces no evil after effect whatsoever
it accomplishes nothing but good

  i want to send free to every person sick or well a simple
statement setting forth this treatment it contains matter
which must interest every thinking person if you live in
new york you are earnestly invited to call but if you cannot
call write for the pamphlet the what the why the
way which will be sent free on application together with

    if my razor wasnt good enough for
me to use i wouldnt ask you to try it

    you certainly cannot doubt the sound logic and wisdom of the many
arguments i have advanced in favor of my razor

    you will admit that unless thegillettepossessed many points of supe-
riority it never would have been accepted by two million men in the past three
years as the best most simple and satisfactory shaving
device in this world

                           in the first place my razor requires no strop-
                        ping no honing it is always ready
                        thats why its the most practical you can
                        in three to five minutes

                                the thin flexible double-edged blades remove a harsh or
                          soft beard with perfect comfort no pulling cutting or irrita-
                          tion of the skin they are so inexpensive that when dull you
                          throw them away as you would an old pen no other razor so
                          durable the triple silver plated holder lasts a lifetime none
                          so convenient the compact little case can be with you always-
                          if travelling either in your pocket or grip

                          i	know men who have shaved in the dark with the  gillette
                        many use it on the train others while on hunting trips fishing
                        expeditions etc

                        thats the beauty of my razor you can obtain a perfect
                        shave under all conditions-wherever you are

                         and i will guarantee you will agree with me right now-that
                         my razor just fits your case a trial will prove it to you

                            action must accompany right thinking or you have no power
                         of execution

                                    put this correct lineof thought into action get a gillette
