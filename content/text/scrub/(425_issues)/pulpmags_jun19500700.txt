without breaking the
swift stroke of his paddle ki-
gor snatched another brief glance
over his shoulder at the pursuing war
canoes

  like the relentless tightening of a giant
hand anxiety gripped his stomach sweat
beaded his bronzed face ran in glistening
streaks down his broad muscle-corded
back

  for more than three hours he and his
three companions in the small canoe had
strained to stay out of arrow range of the
two great thirty-man craft but ki-gor


into that lost world that ancient ter-
rible land of timeless evil came ki
gor white lord of the jungle and his
lovely mate helene they came ill
peace offering friendship  and sha
topat high priest of the sun-god raa
greeted them at the temple-altar of
the drinking stone - treachery and
death like gifts in his hand
the river leaped and roared with ivhitecapped furry    ki-gor drove at arrow at the skull-

pro wed boat   
	jungle

could see clearly that in the past few min-
utes the strange warriors had begun to
gain

  the white lord of the jungle couldnt
hope to call forth more speed from his
companions already they had done the
impossible in fending off for so long their
savage pursuers their tortured bodies
possessed no reserves with which to match
this latest sprint of the many-oared war
canoes

  for the thousandth time ki-gors
glance sped ahead along the sheer smooth
bluffs which walled in the river searching
for a break in the gorge which might
offer a way of escape if they could ever
reach the thickly-forested heights above
the river he felt he could lead them to
safety

  but every yard further that they pene-
trated into the canyon the precipitous
rock walls towered higher grew more im-
pregnable no wonder the savage tribes-
men had followed them with such grim
confidence the blacks had known from
the first that they had their quarry trapped

ki-gor cursed the impulse which
had led him long miles from home
into unknown land expressly to search
out this river worst of all he had been
stupid enough to let his beloved mate
helene and his two close native friends
tembu george and ngeeso accompany
him on the foolhardy trek and the whole
business had been for no better reason
than to seek the truth behind the black
mens legends of the batanya-abi the
river of no return

  well he had learned the truth quickly
enough but it would do neither him nor
the superstition-ridden black men any
good he would never live to tell them
that instead of their fabled devil-city
peopled by monsters and ghostmen who
preyed on all who entered the gorge that
there was only a pack of murderous river-
pirates lying in wait for travellers

  the two skull-prowed canoes had been
hidden in a reed-choked cove near the
mouth of the canyon ki-gor helene and
their two friends had paddled leisurely
past the cove debating whether they
should enter the gorge in their small
canoe or land and attempt to follow the
river on foot

stories

  their decision had been made for them
when the war canoes drove suddenly out
of concealment sent them fleeing into the
canyon before a shower of arrows and
from that first moment on the warriors
had pursued them with insane ferocity at
least it seemed insane to ki-gor for he
could see no logic in sixty men laboring
hour after hour in the burning heat to
overtake a small boat which obviously bore
no worthwhile spoils

  only implacable hatred would drive
blacks to such exertions and yet how or
why would warriors hate men they had
never seen before this was the first time
ki-gor ngeeso or tembu george had
visited this isolated area

  the white lord gave no hint of these
thoughts tumbling pell-mell through his
mind as in a steady confident voice he
called encouragement to his companions
but even as he spoke he wras thankful he
sat in the stern of the canoe so they
couldnt read the truth of his feelings in
his face

  helene was directly ahead of him in the
craft he heard the tortured rasp of her
breathing saw the tremors of weakness
beginning to clutch her arm and back
muscles for all her iron determination
to keep up with her male companions her
womans body was unequal to the task it
caused the white lord unbearable anguish
to see her bravely without a single com-
plaint drive herself to the verge of col-
lapse he longed to call out to her to rest
but he dared not for as she knew even
the loss of her faltering stroke would
increase immediately the rate of gain of
the two war craft

  in front of helene sat tembu george
the giant chieftain of the masai except
for the glistening streams of sweat pour-
ing off of him the huge-thewed warrior
showed less the effects of the gruelling
race than any of them ki-gor knew
though from the leaden fatigue numbing
his own arms that tembu georges prodi-
gous strength was being put to its bitterest
test

  the squat wiry pygmy chieftain
ngeeso crouched in the prow of the
canoe also was weakening he still dug
the water with the same machine-like
precision he had an hour before but the
white lord could tell he was going on
beast-gods of atlantis

sheer nerve unwilling to let his comrades
down though he burst his heart in the
effort

 the canyon made a wide sweeping
turn and abruptly the high walls began
to press closer ki-gor stared ahead down
the narrowing gorge strain penciling
white lines about his hard-set mouth
the current was gaining speed

  not one of them spoke but in every
mind was the same question what lay
before them

  every sign pointed to turbulent danger-
ous water they were in no condition to
cope with rapids in the fast-narrowing
canyon it would take perfect coordination
and boundless strength to keep their light
craft from capsizing or being smashed to
bits against the walls

  along the base of the rock the water
swirled whitely small whirlpools and
strings of dancing bubbles told of con-
verging pressures beneath the surface as
the river was forced in upon itself al-
ready the canoe was beginning to strain
and leap as though imbued with a life of
its own

the gorge was closing in with
alarming speed two hundred yards
ahead the sheer walls swung within
twenty feet of each other and in that
narrow opening the river leaped and
whirled in white-capped fury could they
possibly put the canoe through that swirl-
ing corridor without capsizing or smashing
themselves to bits against the granite

  ki-gor twisted for a last look at the
enemy craft wondering whether they
would carry their strangely furious pursuit
into the passage

  as he turned back he cried to his
three companions the dangos are fol-
lowing us in so it cant be too dangerous
hold to the center and well make it

  ki-gor deliberately told the merest half-
truth the only thing proved by the war
craft following them was that the river
beyond this narrow point wasnt impass-
able as for going through the perilous
corridor itself what would be safe for
the heavy war canoes steadied by many
paddles would be a veritable hell for four
exhausted people in a frail skittering shell
of a boat such as theirs

  but the worst fact of all was that even

if by some miracle they did get through
the large craft would gain tremendously
in the swift-running current and ki-gor
entirely failed to mention that now braced
against the skull-tipped prow of the lead-
ing war canoe was a warrior with a drawn
bow

  the lead canoe had pushed within arrow
range since a single hit in those roaring
waters might well throw the small craft
out of control the picked bowman had
wasted no time in scrambling up for the
try

  because of his position in the stern
ki-gors own broad back would be the
warriors target therefore he kept his
knowledge to himself seeing no sense in
this crucial moment of further upsetting
helene and the two chieftains they
needed to keep all their attention on the
passage and distracting them with worry
about whether he might be hit wouldnt
help to block off the arrows

  then with a sudden wild spurt the
canoe drove into the dangerous area it
bucked and leaped like a frenzied horse
shuddering under the rivers blows seem-
ing to fight deliberately to spin out of
control and shatter itself against the cliffs

  above the rising tumult of the river
sounded the exultant cries of the pursuing
blacks as they saw the crazy skittering
of the small boat they were confident
their long chase was nearly over their
own great canoes were knifing straight
down the center of the gorge

  an arrow barely seen so swift was its
flight dug the roiling surface beside ki-
gors paddle the next barb was high
whirring overhead but in the noise and
confusion of that hurtling ride when their
whole beings were concentrated on the
desperate task of controlling the boat the
white lords companions didnt notice
either arrow and to all outward appear-
ances he was no more awrare of his danger
than were they

  his paddle didnt hesitate in its furious
labors he held his same position unflinch-
ingly aware that his own broad body
shielded helene his strong clear voice
as he shouted instructions and encourage-
ment was devoid even of excitement let
alone fear

  the walls swirled past a dozen times
disaster threatened and was turned away
	jungle

by the swift coordinated action of the
jungle couple and the two chieftains with
death reaching from every side a sudden
strength flared up in them like that last
bright burst of flame from dying embers

  years of trekking together had trained
them to act with a single mind in emer-
gencies so that they strove together
against the river in perfect unison it was
this skilled teamwork plus raw courage
which kept them afloat brought them
hurtling into the narrowest part of the
gorge

the spray-splashed walls reached in-
ward for them uncounted tons of
rock seemed deliberately pressing down
to close off that foaming lane of water
an arrow broke against the granite beside
ki-gor another streaked blood across his
muscle-swollen left shoulder

  the seeking arrows nosed closer with
every shot the next or the next would
find its mark hed been lucky to last
as long as he had realizing this he was
braced inwardly for the tearing shock of
a death-barb hammering into his back

  then suddenly unexpectedly the can-
yon flared wide

  for a length of a hundred yards on
either side the base of the cliffs had been
cut away untold centuries of water gnaw-
ing at soft strata of rock had carved out
the broad circular chamber but as ki-
gor swiftly saw the hands of men had
done much to augment natures work

  the moment the canoe drove into the
open space a wild despairing curse ripped
from ngeesos lips aaaiiiee trapped
he shrilled theyve herded us to the kill
like sheep

  and though ki-gor made no outcry
the same black despair burst over him

  along the cliffs on either side ran broad
stone walks two feet above the water
the walks swarmed with armed warriors
worse yet a long sleek war canoe lay
protected from the current behind a stone
breakwater immediately to their right the
boat was fullv-manned the warriors
poised to send the craft flashing into
action

 the white lord saw these obvious
dangers in a single fleeting glance sensed
menace too in the queer derrick-like
structures built of massive timbers at the

stories

ends of the walks these huge contrap-
tions had heavy stone weights suspended
out over the water from their topmost
beams around the derricks crews of
men busied themselves with cables as large
as a warriors arm

  the shocked masai and pygmy chief-
tains faltered in their stroke the canoe
bucked skidded about at an angle in the
rapid current and threatened to founder
only the white lords skill held it steady
then under the swift lash of ki-gors
voice the two men recovered dug in
furiously with their paddles

  ki-gor had no hope of evading the
storm of arrows and spears which he ex-
pected to burst from the banks in another
instant it was not in him though ever
to give up to wait like a fettered chicken
for the death-blow to fall by all the gods
at least they could make the task of the
butchers more difficult by giving them a
running twisting target perhaps one of
them might survive the cruel gauntlet
manage to head the canoe into the gorge
leading out of the trap letting the river
rather than gloating enemies claim their
bodies

  with the desperation of doomed men
they sent the canoe forward five-ten-
twenty yards they drove tearing their
heart out yet strangely not a single
spear nor arrow sped from the banks to-
ward them

along the cliffs all movement
had ceased abruptly among the
enemy wariors they stood in tense
watchful attitudes quite visibly aflame
with excitement but what puzzled ki-gor
most was their utter silence

  with their prey a perfect target savage
warriors such as these should have been
leaping and shouting in bloodthirsty glee
savoring their triumph to the utmost
what was wrong with the devils it was
like having an executioner pause mid-way
in his axe-swing glare fiercely wordlessly
at his trussed victim

  that waiting for the blow to fall
scraped ki-gors nerves raw sent the
blood pounding through his veins trying
to piece the mystery he snatched a brief
look at the war canoe behind the break-
water wondering if for some obscure
beast-gods

reason the kill was to be left entirely to
it

  but the craft he saw with surprise
still lay motionless in its berth making no
move to intercept them then suddenly
he realized that the attention of the war-
riors in the craft was turned not on him
and his companions but on the entrance
through which would come the two pur-
suing boats which had driven them into
this trap

  a fierce impossible hope exploded in his
brain it was a thing that couldnt be-
and yet why else would this force of
warriors about them act as it did 

  as quick as the thought he turned and
looked back at the two long craft knifing
with terrific speed through the narrow
strait the lead boat only yards away
from the entrance to the great circular
chamber

  the painted warriors wore the same
burning hate-filled expressions as before
showed no relenting in their determination
to overtake the small canoe the native
braced against the skull-tipped prow still
struggled to draw a bead on the white
lord his face a mask of rage because the
rough water kept him from making an
otherwise easy shot

  like beaters on a hunt the warriors had
driven the game before the marksmen
their job was done the trap was closed
it was only human nature that there
should be a slackening in the murderous
intensity with which they had pushed the
long chase

  but there was no slackening

  a thin bitter smile twisted ki-gors
lips he was certain his suspicions were
true and then with lightning speed it
was happening the violent chain of events
which fulfilled to the utmost his wrathful
hopes

 high above the roar of the water
blasted the clear penetrating notes of a
primitive trumpet the crews of men
about the huge-timbered derricks sprang
into action at this signal almost in unison
the immense stone weights were loosed
went plunging down into the river drag-
ging screeching lengths of cable behind
them

  and as the weights disappeared in
clouds of spray with equal suddenness up
from the rivers depths was jerked an iron

of atlantis	

barrier like a flexible picket fence which
closed off the entrance into the wide sec-
tion of the gorge the heavy metal pickets
extended fully two feet above the surface
cruel tusks ready to tear out the bottoms
of the war canoes shatter bones and flesh
of the crewmen thrown against it by the
raging current

  ki-gor saw amazement splinter the con-
torted features of the bowman in the prow
of the lead canoe then as the full signifi-
cance of the gleaming iron pickets struck
the man he dropped his bow spun about
shrieking a warning to his fellows

  his warning came too late both canoes
were ramming at the barrier with terrific
speed

  with the power of the river hurtling
them forward the canoes were like match-
sticks being shot through a funnel the
fear-crazed efforts of the crewmen to re-
verse their paddles were futile

  the first craft slammed head-on into the
barrier the prow tore apart and the craft
gave a great sideways leap snapping off
the stern on the cliffs and then smashing
broadside against the iron teeth an in-
stant later the second canoe struck into
the welter of men and debris and ripped to
pieces on the iron prongs

  ki-gor tore his eyes away from the
spectacle to realize that both ngeeso and
tembu george frantically were telling
him that all exit was barred from the cir-
cular chamber instead of another cruel
iron barrier the white lord saw that a
thick wire netting had been raised across
the other opening to close off their escape

  that means the end for us gasped
helene

  curse the dangos snarled ngeeso
what odds do they want we had no
chance to escape them as it was

ii

fry all my fathers swore

      the furious tembu george jerking
his bow from his back ill see that we
have company in death

  the white lords frowning glance
again swept the cliffs the warriors were
dancing and laughing jubilantly waving
their spears and lxws but instead of be-
ing threatening their air seemed more a
festive holiday one
	jungle

  wait ki-gor cautioned the masai
chieftain if they meant to kill us theyd
get on with the job instead of doing a
victory dance when men destroy your
enemies they are on your side arent
they

  tembu george grunted doubtfully but
he laid down his bow

  ngeeso gave a humorless laugh we
certainly cant loose anything by trying to
convince them of that fact

  well what do we do asked the big
masai

  ki-gor was thinking fast against over-
whelming odds sometimes boldness was
the most effective weapon a man could
use

  lets land and thank them for saving
us he declared as ngeeso says if it
doesnt work we wont be any worse off
than we are now

  they headed for the left bank pulling
strongly as though they hadnt a single
qualm about landing in their intentness
they failed to notice that the river was
losing its turbulence gradually running
slower when the canoe slid up beside the
stone walk ngeeso drew in his paddle
preparing to leap ashore and steady the
craft while the others landed

  sit still ki-gor said low-voiced
then his grey eyes struck hard against the
three big blacks standing nearest the
canoe ai-ya ai-ya he shouted imperi-
ously waving a hand in summons

  the three warriors blinked at him then
after the barest hesitation leaped forward
to hold the canoe

  ki-gor stepped ashore and with all the
confidence in the world turned his back
on the thronging warriors while he helped
helene up beside him he felt a surge of
admiration for his blue-eyed mate for she
faced the blacks with the poise and self-
possession of a queen being welcomed by
loyal subjects he could guess the tre-
mendous effort required for the exhausted
girl to achieve that piece of acting

  ngeeso and tembu george carried
off their part with equal perfection the
pygmy reached up and with the matchless
effrontery of his kind caught hold of the
nearest warrior and swung himself from
the canoe

  tembu george was the last to come
ashore he deliberately took his time

stories

letting the warriors wait while he picked
up his bow and slowly fastened it on his
back it was an effective way of saying
that since he was now out of danger he
wouldnt need the weapon handy then
from the bottom of the canoe he lifted
the two great shovel-bladed masai spears
used by ki-gor and him and the two
lighter spears carried by ngeeso and
helene

  holding the weapons carelessly in one
huge-thewed arm the giant masai finally
stepped onto the stone walk casually
glanced over muscular warriors who were
dwarfed by his presence

  in the meantime without appearing to
do so ki-gors eye had searched out the
leader of the warriors he stood beside a
door-sized tunnel leading into the cliff he
differed from his men in both looks and
dress

  he was a tall well-set-up man with
finely modeled features straight hair and a
light-brown rather than black complexion
instead of the usual native war gear he
wore a plumed silver helmet and a beau-
tifully wrought silver breastplate was
armed with a short flat sword and a
javelin

  where the warriors were barefoot his
feet -were protected by stout sandals his
shins by gleaming metal guards the
strangest part of his apparel to ki-gor
was the skirt-like leather garment joined
strips of studded rhino hide with which
he armored his middle

the leader studied them with a
peculiar intentness frowning slight-
ly apparently undecided as to what move
he should make this slowness in acting
encouraged ki-gor for the mans benefit
the white lord turned toward the two
wrecked canoes laughed grimly at the
predicament of the survivors at the same
time he was listening to the murmured
talk of the warriors noting they spoke the
bantu tongue

  from the comer of his eye the jungle
man saw the leader stroke his chin
thoughtfully for several seconds and then
start forward slowly as though still rather
doubtful about what he was going to do
ki-gor let him get almost to him before
he registered any consciousness of the
mans presence
beast-gods of atlantis



  then ki-gor turned and seeming to
see the armored man for the first time
broke out in a wide smile he pointed
meaningfully toward the blacks struggling
in the water and laughing loudly strode
to meet the oddly garbed warrior

  our thanks to you brother he said
heartily the scavangers had us finished
run to earth we came within your pro-
tection not a paddle stroke too soon he
was face to face with the man bearing his
searching scrutiny without the least sign
of discomfort youll not find us un-
grateful

 who are you stranger the man
asked wonderingly to know this place
and le so certain of our protection

  i am called ki-gor the white lord
replied and this is my wife helene
though in all the jungle there was no
better known name than the white lords
the warriors face showed not a flicker of
recognition

  are-are there- many others like you-
outside he asked he said the word
outside as though he spoke of another
world unutterably remote and mysterious

  ki-gor didnt understand what do
you mean like me

  white-skinned answered the warrior
why yes said ki-gor puzzled
there are many others very many

  the mans eyes narrowed in thought
he glanced quickly almost nervously
about him biting his lower lip then with
a sudden lifting of his chin a squaring of
his shoulder he seemed to come to a deci-
sion

  this is too important an event he
said loudly for a mere soldier to cause
delay with questions i must take you to
the empress teeva immediately genera-
tions ago we of the second empire lost
hope that any other fragments of the
mother country had taken root and sur-
vived but you are proof-living proof
he looked about at his men growing
visibly excited

  we will be great again as in those
lost days before raas anger fell upon us
he spoke more to himself now than to
ki-gor instead of a scattering of blacks
there will be legions armies of true war-
riors to command

  his face aglow he put out his arm and
clasped the white lords shoulder

  ho we must hurry he said all
atlantis will be set aboil by the news of
your coming then suddenly remember-
ing he hadnt introduced himself he said
i am called nepah captain of the red
legion

  he turned away to make preparations
for their departure calling lieutenants to
him and giving orders

  ah-laan-tus  thought ki-gor frown-
ing its a name ive never heard in the
jungle and how strange he acts making
so much ado about our being white and
talking about commanding armies then
he shrugged oh well whats the differ-
ence it was a friendly welcome that we
worried about and we certainly got that

but there was a startled look on
helenes face she was remembering
her schooling in the united states remem-
bering the vague yet fascinating refer-
ences in her reading to the lost continent
of atlantis site of a civilization which
according to legend sank beneath the sea
centuries before greece or rome was
bom

  many men had conjured with the idea
of atlantis ancient writings referred
matter-of-factly to its existence explain-
ing how a cataclysmic upheaval of the
earth had destroyed the continent but all
attempts to substantiate the legends by
locating the sunken cities or connecting
the countrys culture with that of other
ancient but later peoples had come to
nothing in recent years scholars had
termed the whole atlantis idea a myth
saying firmly that since it couldnt be
proved it could never have been

  whats wrong asked ki-gor

  in a hurried whisper she told him the
legend it just couldnt be she con-
cluded and yet when he said the second
empire there leaped into my mind the
thought that perhaps cut off here from the
world a colony of the old atlantis could
have survived

  possibly said ki-gor unimpressed
he knew the unmeasured miles of congo
jungle guarded many strange secrets and
without helenes book-knowledge to spark
his interest another oddity more or less
didnt excite him in fact he took far
greater interest in the discovery that the
turbulent rush of the river had ceased
	jungle

while he had talked with the warrior
water no longer burst in a foaming flood
against the iron spikes which sealed off
the gorge somehow the flow had been
cut in half so that the surface of the
river now ran with relative calmness

  the iron barrier had been lowered until
only the top few inches were visible above
the water the canoe had come from
behind the breakwater and was moving
slowly along the barrier passing lines to
the half-drowned natives clinging to the
spikes although most of the men were
badly gashed and battered with several
slipping from view while ki-gor watched
the boatmen went about their task at a
leisurely pace obviously not caring whe-
ther the wreck victims lived or died their
callous attitude spoke of a deep-seated
hatred born of long and bitter warfare

  when the last line had been distributed
the barrier dropped out of sight and the
canoe turned toward shore dragging the
survivors through the water behind it no
matter how badly some were hurt none
of the painted warriors were taken into
the boat

  as the craft swung close to the bank
the moaning threshing blacks were jerked
roughly from the water thrust into a
semblance of a line many of them were
in no condition to stand but whenever
one of the gagging bleeding men col-
lapsed he was kicked and heaved to his
feet again

  coldly curious about these wrarriors who
had stalked him so relentlessly ki-gor
watched bleakly as they were hauled onto
the bank but his mouth tightened and he
began to clench and unclench his right
fist as he witnessed their harsh mistreat-
ment saw their wounds go unattended no
man was a grimmer or more merciless
foe in battle than the white lord but
once an enemy surrendered he accorded
him good treatment

  anger gathered hotly in his eyes nepah
the captain of the warriors after a single
contemptuous glance at the prisoners had
disappeared into the tunnel in the cliff
ki-gor glanced restively toward the tun-
nel meaning to ask him to control his
men as the seconds drained away and
the captain didnt reappear his patience
exploded

  suddenly without considering the con-

stories

sequences he strode forward pushed be-
tween the guards and the prisoners

  what manner of warriors are you
he said coldly among true men of battle
there is a code of honor which protects
a beaten foe is this the way the men of
atlantis show their bravery beating and
kicking wounded half-dead prisoners

  all along the bank men pivoted in aston-
ishment the guards nearest ki-gor
moved back from this mighty blonde-
maned giant whose voice lashed them with
contempt the taunts and curses which
had filled the air a second before chopped
off

  as she realized what ki-gor had done
helenes face went pale when that quiv-
ering fraction of silence shattered it could
mean death for the white lord that
crazy incredible outlandishly brave man
even the captured blacks on whose behalf
he intervened stared astounded at him

then the captain of the red
legion was cutting through the
crowd hurrying to reach ki-gors side
what wrong nepah said his glance
slashing questioningly at the men about
him

  ki-gor told him

  but i dont understand the captain
said these scum tried to kill you what
do you care what happens to them

  their fangs are drawn now snapped
ki-gor so it is stupid to mistreat them
theyll never fight against you again so
bind up their wounds the side that tri-
umphs can afford to be generous

  nepah stroked his chin his forehead
wrinkling beneath the burnished silver
helmet for the first time he looked at
the prisoners as though they were actually
human beings abruptly he shrugged

  if it pleases you why not he told
ki-gor and he ordered proper care given
the prisoners

  its more than a matter of pleasing a
friend ki-gor said seriously its a
matter of doing the right the decent
thing

  the captain smiled comically ah yes
but who is to say i do a good thing in
prolonging their lives it is question i
will ask of you later-when you have
lived a time in the second empire

  though easily spoken there was an
beast-gods of atlantis



ominous hint in his words

  come our boat waits he invited

  ki-gor turned expectantly toward the
river the canoe which had rescued the
prisoners once more was behind the
breakwater on the far side of the gorge
no other craft was in sight

  no this way nepah said starting
toward the tunnel

  ki-gor hid his surprise waved to helene
and the two chieftains to follow him only
then when he saw the relief flooding into
their faces did he realize fully how great
a chance he had taken for a few-hands of
savages who meant less than nothing to
him he grinned guiltily at tembu george
and ngeeso and picking the easiest path
to the tunnel started along the line of
prisoners

  near the end of the line shoulders
bowed legs widespread with the effort of
standing was a battered native with an
ugly gash across his chest and bloody
tears  both thighs from the spiked
barrier

  i do not forget this white one he
rasped hoarsely when ki-gor came
abreast of him mercy for my men is
something i never expected from one of
the devils breed you have my thanks-
along with my undying hatred v

  ki-gor slowed looked at him closely
then it dawned on him this was the man
who had tried to kill him with the bow
and arrow the raging demon who had
braced himself in the bow of the leading
war canoe

  no matter what tortures are puv upon
me went on the prisoner speaking for
ki-gors ears alone i swear i will live
long enough to one day return your favor
then-then i will be free to kill you for
luring me into this trap he was panting
for breath his red-rimmed eyes almost
crazed with emotion that is the promise
of molaki white one remember it

  no flicker of emotion crossed ki-gors
-features

  youre a fool one-called-molaki he
said quietly a very great fool

the white lord walked on to
the tunnel sternly repressing the
angry words which seethed within him
nothing was to be gained in talking fur-
ther with the fanatical black though a

civilized man would have scoffed at the
natives promise as the meaningless bab-
blings of a hurt dazed man ki-gor knew
molaki meant exactly what he said

  in intervening successfully for his men
the black felt that ki-gor had put him in his
debt molaki as their leader was responsi-
ble for his warriors and if at a time
when he was unable to help them another
person assumed that responsibility then he
must personally see that the favor was
repaid in full the fact that he thought
ki-gor had deliberately led him into a
trap made it even more pressing to repay
the favor for it was bitter medicine to
accept charity from a hated enemy

  helene caught up with ki-gor as lie
reached the tunnel the dim walkway was
barely wide enough for them to proceed
side by side and its ceiling was so low
the jungle man had to stoop to keep from
scraping his head the corridor bored
straight into the rock with the only illum-
ination being the weak yellow glow every
ten yards of small charcoal-filled braziers
set in the walls nepah walked briskly
ahead of them

  a few steps past the fifth brazier the
tunnel opened into a high vaulted cavern
in the light of torches held by natives
ki-gor could see that the cavern was fully
two hundred yards wide and down the
center of it like a precisely cut canal
shone the black waters of a stream there
was no way to estimate the length of the
underground chamber for it disappeared
into velvet darkness on either side of the
jungle man

  a canoe manned by ten paddlers waited
in the water drawn up on the bank near-
by were seven empty craft the three
of us will go with them the warrior
captain declared

  three said ki-gor youre mis-
taken there are five of us

  nepah turned slowly theres no rush
about your servants he said ill have
them brought along later

  ki-gor spoke with sharp emphasis
these men are a very long way from
being servants they are my friends the
two greatest chieftains of the jungle
tembu george of the masai and ngeeso
of the pygmies

  a fleeting expression of surprise passed
over nepahs face and was hidden he
	jungle

inclined his head slightly

  i meant no discourtesy he apologized
easily it is just that our customs   
he thought better of what he had meant
to say and let the sentence trail away it
will be difficult with the empress teeva
but perhaps it can be managed

  the masai and pygmies could be
powerful allies for atlantis ki-gor said
pointedly -or very dangerous enemies
you understand of course both tribes
know that their leaders accompanied me
to this place

  nepahs lips twisted in a cynical smile
and you must understand o ki-gor
he said evenly that the decisions of an
empress are quite beyond me i am a
humble soldier i do what i am told with-
out regard for allies or enemies

briskly then he ordered two of
the paddlers out of the canoe to
make room for the chieftains he helped
helene into the craft stood aside while
ki-gor and his friends stepped in ki-gor
was increasingly puzzled by the warrior
or perhaps intrigued was more the
word

  it was impossible to gauge the man at
one moment he seemed naive almost ignor-
ant and the next sardonically wise most
of his statements the white lord felt
carried two meanings one which you un-
derstood and another subtler one which
only he understood he was a soldier yes
but an unusual one and quite lacking in
the humbleness he professed

  nepah was preparing to follow the
others into the boat when his glance fell
on the empty canoes he stopped abruptly
spun to confront the nearest torchbearer

  one craft is gone he cried accus-
ingly i ordered that no person was to
leave

  the torch trembled in the natives hand
the whites of his eyes showed and the
pulsing beat of fear shook his belly

  it was the priest sire explained the
black shakily i told him your orders but
he pushed me aside and had his men
launch the canoe his voice almost failed
him and for a second all he could utter
was an incoherent clucking noise i-i
couldnt kill a priest sire i couldnt do
that and he sped off before there was a
chance to call you

stories

  the captain stood rigidly his fists
clenched his face dark with anger that
cursed priest he snarled i should have
known better i forgot he had his crew
to row him

  then he snatched the torch from the
black whirled with catlike speed and
springing into the canoe roared to the
oarsmen to pull their backs out or he
would have them flayed alive

  the canoe leaped ahead at his order
knifing away from the landing down the
dark channel of water affixed to a metal
holder on the prow of the boat was a
torch which strove ineffectually to light
the way for the oarsmen but the straining
men seemed to know every inch of the
stream so well that illumination was un-
important

  noting- the dark scowl which persisted
on nepahs features ki-gor asked him
why the priests departure had upset him
the jungle man sensed that he and his
companions were somehow involved in
the matter

  i wanted to get you and the red-
haired woman to the empress gritted
nepah before sha-topat even suspected
your presence your coming will deal a
blow to the prestige of the whole priest-
hood

  he shook his head worriedly leaned to
stare ahead into the caverns darkness

  now though theres no knowing what
to expect hes as dangerous as a cobra
and a thousand times more cunning

  but why should our presence harm
him  ki-gor wanted to know

  the warrior captain smiled thinly mal-
ice gleaming in his eyes because the
priesthood has kept us locked within our
stronghold rotting away to weakness year
by year by preaching that no help lay
on the outside for us we were the last
segment of the white race alive they
swore outside only endless hordes of
black barbarians existed by your very
presence you prove sha-topat isnt di-
vinely infallible

  surely some of you go out declared
ki-gor those painted devils who chased
us wouldnt be patrolling the river if they
werent on the lookout for your war
parties molakis angry speech had shown
that he mistook the white lord for a
citizen of atlantis
beast-gods of atlantis



  the captain nodded agreement parties
go out all right-but only sha-topats
men bitter irony edged his voice only
the anointed of raa can be safely exposed
to the evils beyond our gates conveniently
therefore they are the only ones who
can loot enemy villages and capture
slaves

ki-gor flexed his fingers regarding
them studiously the talk of ancient
empires was beyond him but he under-
stood thoroughly the struggle of ruthless
leaders for power over people he had
no desire to become a pawn in the battle
between the unseen religious and temporal
heads of atlantis

  for an humble soldier who thinks no
further than his immediate duty ki-gor
said lightly you seem unusually even
personally concerned in the affairs of
your superiors

  the soft-spoken gibe went home nepah
was immediately more guarded realizing
that in his anger he had revealed more of
himself than he had intended

  i think you mistake my motives he
said after all bringing you to the
empress is quite a feather in my cap he
added meaningfully when youve been
on guard in that damp sunless gorge as
many moons as i have you remember
longingly how easy life was in the palace
guards

  but nepahs protestations didnt ring
true to the white lord there was more
than personal ambition mixed in his desire
to outwit sha-topat though possessed
of a sardonic handsomeness and a court-
iers smooth tongue nepah was no soft-
handed palace dandy

  helene turned and smiled at the captain
you belittle yourself she chided show-
ing she had been following their talk its
unfortunately true that the best warriors
draw the most dangerous and unpleasant
duties we saw how efficiently you handled
your job

  you flatter me murmured nepah
would that the empress thought as you
do

  that reminds me put in ki-gor
how in the world do you control the flow
of water in that gorge it was a roaring
deathtrap until those two canoes piled up
and then it got as quiet as a pond

  nepahs eyes roved the darkness he
called for more speed from the oarsmen
despite his calm flow of conversation it
was apparent that inwardly he grew more
anxious by the minute when they didnt
bring the priests boat into view

  its a simple but very clever trick
devised by the second empires builders
he said just above the narrow portion of
the gorge they cut a tunnel from this
cavern through to the river coming in well
beneath the surface so no opening would
be visible by the use of flood gates we
can divert as much or as little water from
the gorge as we like thus making the river
run rough or calm

  ki-gor was impressed and compli-
mented the method by which the river was
used as a powerful defense weapon ob-
viously the builders of the second empire
possessed a high order of intelligence

  but why do we travel this cavern
asked helene surely your people dont
live underground

  no not quite underground said
nepah with a trace of laughter but
this stream is the one and only way to
reach atlantis youll understand in a
moment were almost there

  he pointed to a rapidly growing circle
of light ahead of them helene and ki-
gor leaned forward tensely awaiting their
initial glimpse of atlantis

  in the canoe all was quiet except for
the hard breathing of the oarsmen and the
gentle splash of paddles digging the water
in unison daylight reached through the
darkness toward them faintly outlining
in grey the wet rock of the cavern

  then with the suddenness of a tropical
storm the attack broke over them

  their first intimation of trouble was the
heavy crash of a grappling hook against
the prow of the craft the forward torch
was knocked from its metal holder into the
river then came the pain-crazed shriek
of an oarsman impaled in the back by a
second hook sitting in the middle of the
boat the man was jerked upright and
pulled overboard with a wild flailing of
arms and legs

  the craft rocked dangerously panic
blasted among the oarsmen showering
out of the grey murk came more of the
grappling irons one hammered over the
side by helene narrowly missing her
	jungle

arm as it bit into the wood

  then shadowy figures came leaping
from their hiding places behind piles of
debris along the edge of the stream the
ropes connected to the grappling irons
snapped taut almost immediately the
canoe angled in toward the bank drawn
by the furiously straining attackers
grouped at the end of each rope

ill

nepah was on his feet

screaming orders to his oarsmen
but the men were in utter confusion their
paddles forgotten some of them strug-
gling to tear loose the irons with their
bare hands others fighting to get out of
the boat

  the ropes cut the ropes you fools
roared nepah

  if any heard him they paid no heed
the canoe was nearly against the bank
nepahs torch picked out a score of
hooded black-robed figures as they dropped
ropes and drove forward ripping short
broad-bladed swords free of black sheaths
as they came

  as a stranger in a strange land ki-
gor had waited for the men of atlantis to
take the lead he had felt they would be
familiar with such attacks would know
better than he how to combat this one

  but now as he saw utter disaster en-
gulfing them realized the fear-crazed
crewmen werent going t to make any
effort to defend themselves ki-gor came
to his feet in a flaming rage he rode the
heaving sway of the boat on braced legs
his long knife making a glittering sweep as
he whipped it out

  his great voice beat through the uproar
to reach the faithful tembu george and
ngeeso get ashore he cried weve
no chance in the boat beside him
helene started to rise his left hand
caught her shoulder pressed her down
stay here he told her his fingers
brushed her cheek her hair in brief ca-
ress

  then with lightning speed he whirled
snatched the torch from nepahs grasp
like a great cat he sprang out across the
narrowing strip of water separating the
canoe from the bank

  when he landed on the shore the at-

storjes

tackers were almost on him had he
wavered for a moment he would have
gone down under the solid rush of their
bodies but as soon as his feet touched the
rock his steel-thewed legs were catapult-
ing him forward

  moving with all his unbelievable speed
he blasted straight at the closest robed
figure his knife sang with the terrible
violence of his stroke like a felled tree
the man toppled aside cut nearly apart in
the middle

  before the gouting rush of the mans
blood stained his black robe ki-gor was
past him his blade clanged against the
short sword of his second victim knocked
it in a gleaming arc with a short quick
slash he laid open the mans throat

  then he spun to the left sweeping his
heavy knife down on a thin mans hooded
head he jerked it free and laying a wall
of steel about him to send the last two
attackers leaping out of his path he broke
free of the group

  by his swift and deadly charge he had
burst through the whole line of robed
men they hadnt had a chance to con-
verge on him now instead of being
backed against the river he had gotten
into the clear with plenty of room to
maneuver in when they tried to mob him

  thrown offstride by the white lords
action the whole enemy plan of attack
went to pieces a few robed men drove
on at the boat and others turned to go
after ki-gor but the majority wavered
uncertainly the jungle man had counted
on causing enough disruption to give
tembu george and ngeeso time to get
ashore but it seemed odd to him that the
enemy should let him draw them off the
greater target of the boat so easily

  another thing that puzzled him was the
utter silence in which the attackers fought
there was none of the shouting cursing
bedlam which accompanied most hand-to-
hand fighting in the jungle there were
no orders given and even those men he
struck down died with nothing more than
gurgling grunts of pain

acting deliberately to rivet

more attention on himself ki-gor
threw back his head made the cavern
reverberate with the chilling masai war
cry standing with the torch held high in
beast-gods of atlantis



his left hand his red-stained blade ready
in his right the white lord was like some
awesome pagan god of battle come to
life

  he seemed infinitely larger more mas-
sive in the shifting changing light the
brute animal vigor of the man was a
pulsing crackling force that struck one
like an electric shock granite-hard sheaths
of muscles ridged out across his abnormal-
ly deep chest girded his lean flat middle
and long powerful legs

  battle wrought an amazing change in
ki-gor though normally he was a quiet
pleasant almost shy person in combat
he became a raging machine of destruc-
tion his whole character and look altering
completely he was far above most men
in strength and speed and he had a lions
courage a leopards cunning it was not
that he liked fighting for he labored
endlessly to end tribal warfare and bring
peace to the jungle but he seemed en-
dowed by nature to be a warrior fated
always to be cast into situations where
he must exert his battle prowess he
knew by instinct more tricks of combat
than most men would learn in a life-time
and in addition he had amassed bitterly
won experience from countless deadly
jungle struggles

  now by his swift daring action his
willingness to draw the full fury of the
enemy attack on himself he saved nepahs
men from massacre

  as the bulk of the enemy turned away
from the river to rush him tembu george
and ngeeso entered the fray ki-gor
had given them time to recover their
spears from the bottom of the boat like
twin demons they came ashore fighting
as a team as was their favorite custom

  against the short swords of the at-
tackers the chieftains spears gave them a
decided advantage and they utilized it to
the fullest the robed killers hacking at
the fear-stricken oarsmen were the masai
and pygmy leaders first targets they
struck in among them thrusting and
stabbing with terrible accuracy knowing
without an order from ki-gor that their
first job must be to insure helenes safety

  in a thrice they had swept the bank
clear scattering all the surprised attackers
except for four grotesquely flopping forms
-jungle-summer

who would never again be a danger to
anyone

  and with their blood lust whetted by
those initial four victims tembu george
and ngeeso sped in behind the men who
were rushing the white lord

  unlike ki-gor these two fierce black
men revelled in battle taking savage joy
in the dispatching of a foe for centuries
war had been the wine of life the ultimate
goal of every males training for both
their tribes the proud masai and pyg-
mies had been the greatest troublemakers
in the congo before they came under the
white lords influence

the chieftains went to the
jungle mans aid in the nick of time
for despite his skill and agility he was
hard put to keep from being borne under
by the swarming attackers there was a
fanatical desperation in the way the raiders
hurled themselves in upon him only by
twisting turning and rapidly giving
ground while his blade wove a glittering
shield about him did he manage to beat
them off

  it was a brilliant display of swordsman-
ship but the man didnt live who could
long sustain such exertions and ki-gors
strength already had been drained by the
gruelling canoe race down the gorge

 ho we come boomed tembu
george and with his shovel-bladed masai
spear he impaled a foe tossed him aside
like a spade-full of dirt

  death to the jackals shrilled ngeeso
he darted forward jabbed viciously with
his shorter weapon a robed figure in the
midst of a sword slash at ki-gor whirled
off-balance drunkenly and fell legs liter-
ally cut from under him by the pygmv

  and then as they bounded forward
intent on hacking a path through to ki-
gor suddenly nepah was fighting beside
them with his armor he was a valuable
ally he threw himself boldly at the
enemy more than matching the chieftains
hurried advance

  nepah was the first to reach the white
lords side back to the boat he
shouted there may be more of these
devils servants on the way he blocked
an enemys thrust expertly with his short
sword thanks to you i had time to cut
away the ropes and beat some sense into
	jungle

the crewmen

  as the four of them wheeled in a solid
front the hooded men slackened their
assault they obviously were stunned by
the swift turn of events instead of cower-
ing sheep for victims the attackers found
they had stirred up maddened lions in-
stead of killing they were being killed

  tembu georges spear flicked out and
a man staggered back with his shoulder
laid open into them into them cried
the masai leader

  there was no holding the chieftains
they were wild with battle they swept
nepah and ki-gor along with them in a
new charge impotent against those merci-
less spears the hooded raiders went reel-
ing back then abruptly like frightened
chickens they broke and ran

  only by leaping in front of tembu
george and ngeeso did the white lord
prevent the chieftains from giving chase
oh no little ones he panted lets
get out of here while we can

  but that carrion squealed ngeeso
in protest by all the gods weve -got
them finished

  if this is my sample of atlantis hos-
pitality youll have fighting aplenty be-
fore you see your home kraal again ki-
gor predicted and with the firmness of a
parent handling excited children he herded
them toward the boat

  nepah watched them wonderingly for
a moment breath of the black one he
muttered under his breath what manner
of man is this ki-gor

the canoe lay a safe distance out
of the stream manned by about half
the original number of crewmen the
missing ones had deserted diving in their
panic into the dark water or leaping
ashore to flee blindly into the cavern very
few had been slain

  as nepah called the boat closer ki-gor
asked what was to be done about the
deserters they can worry about them-
selves declared the captain angrily
their duty was to protect you yet they
ran like rats so they deserve whatever
fate they get

  why was it their duty especially to
protect me asked ki-gor in surprise

  nepah looked at him curiously you
mean you didnt realize that you were the

stories

whole reason for that attack

  you must be mistaken ki-gor said
no one but you knows im here i have
no enemies in a land ive never seen
nepahs lips twisted bitterly sha-
topat knows you are here he was will-
ing to slaughter us all to get his hands
on you he rubbed his diin thoughtfully
it is interesting to know that he would
go to such lengths to keep you from enter-
ing atlantis very interesting perhaps
youre of even greater value than i
thought

  his words reminded ki-gor of the
priest who had slipped away from the
gorge against nepahs orders no won-
der the captain had been so concerned he
had feared some kind of interference

  i dont understand any of it the
white lord said brusquely but if what
you say is true then lets confront this
sha-topat and have an accounting if
there is any justice in atlantis at all
surely we will have the backing of your
empress

  ki-gor took his place in the boat be-
side helene the others had preceded him
they began to move toward the circle of
light again

  you make no answer the jungle man
said to nepah dont you agree with
me

  the captain sucked in his breath slowly
selecting his words with care

  in the second empire one does not
pit his word against sha-topats he said
the power and prestige of the priest-
craft is too great a shield to be pierced
by accusations from us

  helene had been listening tensely she
burst out indignantly we have proof
enough every person in this boat is a
witness to the attack

  and you think men who stand in such
superstitious dread of the priestcraft
said nepah that they wont defend their
own lives would speak out against sha-
topat he snorted in disgust for that
matter even if they shouted all over at-
lantis that the priests had loosed trained
killers on them it would prove nothing
except that they were tired of life the
loudest of them would be arrested for
speaking heresy the others as the days
passed would begin to die of strange
maladies meet with unexplained acci-
beast-gods of atlantis

dents

  he spat into the water his eyes narrow
in the torchlight

  and the priests would say he went
on  poor misguided men they should
have known that raas vengeance falls
swiftly on those who would do harm to
his servants

t-gor and helene listened in-
credulously to his description of how
the hooded terrorists killed and kidnapped
great numbers of men and women every
year all efforts to curb them came to
naught the common people feared them
far more than they did the empress
soldiers and would never give information
against them or admit any knowledge of
their activities

  you dont seem to be afraid to oppose
them declared ki-gor if you can fight
them and live why cant others do the
same

  my case is a little different from
most nepah said without elaboration

  ngeeso jabbed the air with his right
fist haiee gather a few more like your-
self and take some prisoners he ex-
ploded impatiently its a simple thing to
make such carrion babble their heads off
about their masters

  nepah received the savage little pygmys
open suggestion of torture with faintly
amused tolerance after seeing them in
combat his manner toward ngeeso and
tembu george had become much friend-
lier

  the odds are always in their favor
when they attack the captain explained
they made a rare misjudgement today
the first ive ever known them to make it
was a natural error though who would
ever have expected you three to react as
you did most strangers would have
shared the crews panic he added pro-
phetically they wont make that error
the next time

  the undermanned boat moved sluggish-
ly into the brightening light of day then
they were out of the cavern with the deep
blue waters of a lake beneath them

  rut what i started to say nepah went
on talking was that you seldom get a
chance to capture one of the dangos they
strike out of the darkness and are gone
if one of them is cornered or too

wounded to get away hell kill himself
rather than to be taken alive

  ngeeso who was much more inter-
ested in the thought of future battles with
the robed assasins than in anything so
commonplace as scenery continued to give
his entire attention to nepah but the
jungle couple and tembu george stared
raptly about them

  they had entered an immense crater
the almost perpendicular walls towered
hundreds of feet above them apparently
in some long-past age a tremendous vol-
canic explosion had blasted the whole heart
out of a sprawling mountain spewing out
immeasurable tons of rock like a cork shot
from a bottle green moss lichens and
thickly tangled vines clung to the crater
walls a wild brilliantly colored tapestry
through which ki-gor could spy the flitting
forms of monkeys and bright-plumed
jungl e-birds

  except for a single broad level island
in its center the floor of the crater was
covered by the lake along the nearest
shore of the island lay a walled city grey
and ancient and brooding the massive
stone walls came down to the very edge
of the water and above and beyond them
could be seen rooftops towers and temples
strangely out-of-place on this hidden
congo island

  broad cultivated fields were visible on
either side of the city but the rest of
the island fully four-lifths of it was a
wild tangle of jungle seemingly no more
touched by the hand of man than the
white lords own forest retreat

ki-gor sat silently his prob-
ing eyes missing no detail of the
scene as they drew near the island with-
out ever entering the walls he knew many
things about this forgotten fragment of a
long-dead civilization

  he knew that the fabulous talent and
industry which had raised this impressive
citadel in a hostile wilderness had long
since been lost the walls on closer in-
spection were sagging and broken the
weathered towers in many cases in dan-
gerous disrepair far from improving on
the work of their fathers the people of
atlantis werent even able to maintain
what had been left them

  though right beside them the jungle
	jungle

was a riot of luxuriant growth the fields
about the city bore sparse scraggiy crops
surprisingly few boats were in evidence
along the bank and on the walls in the
fields and along the waterfront not a
single white-skinned person was in evi-
dence only slow-moving lackadasical
blacks

  nothing ki-gor saw spoke well of the
second empires rulers in fact the use of
the word empire was a pathetic farce
to the practical jungle man but helene
sitting beside him saw the city in an
entirely different and far less critical light
her view was colored by the romance and
drama of the place for she saw it through
the veil of history was awed by the knowl-
edge that she was penetrating a secret kept
for centuries

  tembu georges feelings about the
second empire were far less complicated
he regarded it from a strictly military
viewpoint using a handful of men you
could fight off forever a hundred armies
he said

  ngeeso heard him and turned with a
look of mock amazement what he
hissed you mean the masai couldnt take
this place

  you put words in my mouth small
one grinned the masai chieftain

  ive waited all my life to hear a
masai admit he could be beaten gloated
the impish pygmy ho will wonders
never cease you admitted it without
blinking an eye

  tembu george squinted at the high
walls of the crater i admitted nothing
about the masai he said contentedly i
spoke only of ordinary run-of-the-jungle
warriors- he paused to flick an imagin-
ary gnat from his arm-men like your-
self if i must be plain he smiled and
winked at the white lord then the boat
nosed up to a small stone dock and nepah
hurried them ashore obviously they
werent being taken to the citys main
landing a narrow door was set into the
wall nepah hammered it with the hilt of
his sword

  though the entrance looked unused ki-
gor noted that the door ened swiftly
and without a single protesting squeak
nepah pushed past a black guard led the
way down a musty yard-wide corridor
into a low torchlit room where sat four

stories

more guards

  the men came hastily to their feet the
moment nepah entered seemingly sur-
prised to see him ki-gor had served with
too many wrarriors not to recognize the
respect of the natives for the captain it
was more than mere deference to rank

  see that my crewmen are cared for
ordered nepah get them out of sight
no one is to talk with them or even know
where they are for the time being he
stabbed a finger at two of the men light
the way to the red palace i want to avoid
the streets

following the captain and

the torchbearers ki-gor and helene
went through a door down two flights of
dank stairs and into a chill wet tunnel
for long minutes they hurried through
twisting passages slowing only to skirt piles
of debris where the sides or roof had
given way whatever the original purpose
of the network of tunnels beneath atlantis
it was obvious they had long been aban-
doned

  ki-gor was troubled by the excessive
secrecy with which nepah was bringing
them into the city it boded no good for
their future well-being he felt more and
more that nepah regarded them as im-
portant pawns to be used in a struggle
between the empress and sha-topat

  and it occurred further to ki-gor thal
they were placing a great deal of trust in
the captain he could be a scoundrel for
all they knew despite his brave words
about devotion to country he could be
using them in a private intrigue of his
own there was bound to be something
seriously wrong when a servant of the
empress instead of approaching his ruler
openly in her own capital chose a furtive
backdoor route

  though tembu george and ngeeso
appeared utterly unperturbed soon after
they entered the tunnel ki-gor realized
that they shared his doubts they had
brought their spears into the passage and
for men who were always so careful with
their weapons they seemed to ki-gor sud-
denly to become unbelievably careless and
awkward time after time they let their
spear-points grate against the walls and
at every turn into a new passage they were
particularly clumsy
beastgods of atlantis



  if they even heards the sounds nepah
and the guards paid no attention but
after wincing several times at the rough
treatment of valuable weapons the white
lord looked questioningly back at his
friends he saw ngeeso holding his
spear firmly about two feet back of the
point deliberately gash the soft damp-
rotted stone

  then he realized what the chieftains
were doing by acting as if they were hav-
ing trouble with their spears in the
cramped underground corridors they were
gouging white slashes out of the moss-
covered stone to mark their route ki-
gors eyes sharpened appreciatively never
too trusting of strangers the chieftains
were leaving open a way of retreat

  the guides finally brought them into a
passage which slanted upward for a hun-
dred yards and came to a dead end you
may go back now nepah said dismissing
the blacks without a word they turned
and hurried away down the ramp

  as the torch-carrying natives disap-
peared utter darkness closed over the
blocked tunnel tembu george and ngeeso
moved in beside the jungle couple fearing
a trap nepah never knew how close to
death he came in that moment when he
failed to explain what he was about

  ki-gor was poised to spring his sword
already half-drawn when there was a
faint creak and a widening line of light
in the tunnels dead-end revealed nepah
shoving open a small door apparently he
had waited until the guides were gone so
no one could learn the trick by which
he opened a door through seemingly solid
rock

  as wary as a leopard ki-gor followed
the captain through the opening shielded
helene behind him they were in a small
room bare except for two dusty racks of
armor and weapons from the little-used
armory nepah led them into a hall up
two high narrow flights of stairs

  four powerful black warriors stood
guard before an ornate door they stif-
fened to attention when they saw the
captain lounging in a nearby window was
the first white man beside nepah they
had seen in atlantis he wore the metal
and leather armor but he was a small lan-
guid man with little of the look of a war-
rior about him

  what have we here that excites you
so nepah he asked nasally his glance
ran over the group as he took his time
about getting up you take quite a chance
leaving your border post to visit us if
anything should go wrong i wouldnt
want to be in your place he screwed up
his thin face disapprovingly whats the
story back of these people they look as
white as we do there was a malicious
insolence about him

  nepah flushed red with anger an-
nounce me tal you stupid self-important
fool think you that i came here to prattle
with you  he moved threateningly to-
ward the man quick now before i take
your worthless duties on myself

  startled by nepahs outburst the man
backed nervously toward the door his
mouth twisting he apparently had ex-
pected the captain meekly to submit to
his insulting posturing and prying and
when he didnt tals air of superiority
abruptly disappeared

  but with his hand on the door he re-
covered enough assurance to snarl still
trying to be the old arrogant nepah eh
maybe after a few more moons in that
gorge youll realize youre finished it is
friends at court not more enemies that
you should be trying desperately to make
then he slid through the door and was
gone

iv

nepah glowered stung by

tals parting shot lice he said
by way of explanation to ki-gor human
lice ill see them all cleaned out of the
palace one day his jaw was firmly set

  the black guards hadnt shifted a mus-
cle during the entire exchange but the
white lord noted an approving glitter
in their eyes

  tal came out of the room i told the
empress you had left your post he said
venomously and were outside with some
visitors asking to see her his pale lips
curled triumphantly she said for you
to come in-only you she seemed rather
angry

  im sure you presented my case quite
well said nepah sarcastically then he
brushed tal aside disgustedly and strode
into the room to undo whatever harm the
	jungle

man had caused with lies

  tal straigthened himself indignantly
noted that ki-gor was staring stonily at
him

  all right who are you he demanded
and what are you doing here the
empress has no time for persons dragged
in by the likes of nepah hes finished
himself for good by turning up at her
door today so whatever youve got to say
say it to me and quickly

  completely unperturbed by his bluster-
ing the white lord continued to look
through him not saying a word

  answer me dolt cried tal moving
threateningly toward ki-gor im in com-
mand here ill bear no insolence from
you

  helene glanced up at her mate if the
rest are as unpleasant as this little barking
dog she said in the pygmy tongue id
prefer that we make it short

  tal whirled on her what was that
gibberish he snapped out with it ill
have no talking in a strange tongue

  when she didnt immediately reply he
grabbed at her shoulder that was when
he made his mistake ki-gor would have
borne tals ranting but even if a hundred
instead of four armed guards had stood
behind the man he wouldnt have per-
mitted him to touch helene

  too swiftly for the eye to follow the
jungle lords right hand shot out snapped
tight about tals wrist before the soft-
muscled warrior realized what was hap-
pening he was jerked bodily into the air
and plunked down jokingly on his
haunches a good six feet away from
helene

  he looked like a limp boneless rag doll
legs spraddled head awry an expression
of stupid uncomprehending amazement
frozen on his too-small face ki-gor re-
tained his grip on tals arm

  you do not shove helene warned
ki-gor ominously he pulled the armored
man to his feet now if you must have
trouble ill give it to you even the lowest
bushman respects the rights of a guest

  the white lord released his grip tal
was beginning to recover his faculties he
tottered back a few steps his face white
as a fishs belly his mouth sagged open

  then abruptly a hysterical mixture of
hate rage and fear ripped his features

stories

he scuttled crab-like another ten steps
stopping only when his back was against
the window he stabbed a trembling hand
at ki-gor

  you dare hit me-me he screamed
death is the penalty for harming an im-
perial officer he had lost all control of
himself seize them guards he com-
manded seize them all

  for a bare moment the four blacks
hesitated they knew their officer was
in the wrong but still it was their duty to
obey him unquestioningly so years of
discipline prevailed and with well-drilled
precision they fanned out preparatory to
rushing the strangers

  ki-gor wasnt in any mood to allow
himself or his companions to be man-
handled hed given that insane pipsqueak
fair warning when he realized the blacks
meant to attack he seized the initiative
relying once more on a swift unexpected
move to pull them out of trouble

  he swerved and like a shot out of a
gun drove at tal who thought he had
placed himself out of danger since he had
to cross directly in front of two of the
guards either of them could have brought
him down with a quick javelin thrust
could they have acted fast enough

  but the white lord had seen their
hesitation guessed that they were inwardly
confused about the rightness of their
officers orders uncertain men act slowly
he was past them and diving at tal be-
fore it dawned on them that he not they
had become the aggressor

tal cringed back against the
wall fumbling for his sword he
saw ki-gor come at him with incredible
speed he forgot his sword and shrieked
like a terrified woman giving up all
thought of resistance he wrenched away
from the wall hoping to flee it was too
late

  the white lord was lunging for him
with outstretched arms his screams ended
in an explosive grunt as he was thrown
hard against the wall then ki-gor lifted
him bodily and whirled around to face the
guards tom loose tals helmet clattered
across the floor

  the two men he had outfoxed were
running to aid their officer the other two
stood indecisively suddenly finding them-
beast-gods of atlantis	

selves faced by the longer spears of tenibu
george and ngeeso

  stand back or he dies snarled ki-
gor

  he held tal in front of him like a
stick of wood poised to plunge the
officer head-first against the walls

  dont kill me dont kill me pleaded
the gasping fear-palsied officer get
back he screamed at the blacks

  the guards slowed stopped it was in
their minds to try swift javelin throws
the weapons balanced in upraised hands
they tensely eyed the jungle man gauging
their chances of felling him before he
could swing tal against the stone

  ki-gor read their intentions as they
sidled apart trying to divide his attention
and pin him in a corner he clasped tal
protectively in front of him with his left
hand snatched the mans sword free with
his right he held the blade across tals
throat

  order them to drop their weapons and
face the wall commanded ki-gor fierce-
ly one more threatening move from
them and ill slit your throat from ear to
ear

  we wont do it white man declared
one of the guards hoarsely our duty to
protect the empress comes above our duty
to him youll never get past us

  veritable spasms of fear shook tal
without the support of ki-gors arm he
couldnt have stood upright

  forget her yon cursed dingos he
screeched cant you see this madman
will kill me do as he says

  before ki-gor had a chance to explain
that he had no intention of entering their
rulers chamber that he was acting strictly
in self-protection suddenly a womans
voice husky calm and ominous sounded
in the room

  so you would forget your empress
eh tal the woman said the fact
that you are sworn to die for her means
nothing your loyalty is as impressive as
your battle prowess tal the empire
should do something special i think for
a man of your worth

destde nepah in the doorway
which the warriors sought to guard
stood one of the most beautiful women
ki-gor had ever seen her hair was like

midnight her skin a luminous white be-
neath the arched line of her brows her
large eyes were changeful pools of dark-
ness as though strange black tongues of
flame curled and twisted in their depths

  she wore a sheer robe of purest white
bound close about her slim waist by a
narrow circlet of gold the very simplicity
of her dress served to accentuate the
striking beauty of her lithe curved body
she was of medium height but her air
of certain and absolute authority made
her appear taller

  tal gave a convulsive gasp his eyes
bulged like the large ends of two yellow
eggs teeva he blurted and his voice
blurred into incoherent gurgling and
moaning

  when they realized their sovereign was
watching them the guards lost their hesi-
tancy once more began jockeying for
positions from which they could success-
fully attack the strangers but with the
single word hold teeva quieted them
what is the meaning of this she de-
manded of ki-gor

  unintimidated by her haughty tone ki-
gor heatedly replied it should be quite
clear we are defending ourselves against
this vicious little mad dog you permit to
command your guards

  teevas mouth tightened and the dark
fire of her eyes swirled high yet it was
against the white lord not tal that her
displeasure now was directed the fact
that he dared address her so abruptly as
though he were her equal angered her

  nepah read her mind remember sha-
topat he reminded her softly but not
so softly that ki-gor didnt hear

  she drew a long breath in another
moment a slight smile flickered about her
lips the officers brief reminder worked
an immediate change in her

  tal again eh she said i think ive
overlooked too much of his trouble-making
perhaps he needs to learn i still rule
atlantis

  oh no begged tal its his fault he
tried to force his way past me i was
defending you

  teeva seemed not to hear his babbling
she came toward ki-gor and the knowl-
edge of her beauty was in her walk

  probably you wonder why ive toler-
ated him she went on hes the last
	jungle

male descendant of one of the empires
greatest families on that terrible day
when the very earth sank away beneath the
first empire it was an ancestor of his
who brought the royal family away to
safety

  her lips curled in disgust she was close
to ki-gor then looking searchingly into
his grey eyes

  since that time by tradition the elder
son of the family has been given a high
post in the armies of atlantis

  tal writhed in the white lords grasp
his pasty face working and twitching it
is a sacred debt he whined there
would be no second empire had it not
been for my fathers raa will curse you
if you turn against me

  with the queen within easy reach the
jungle man no longer needed tal as a
hostage he threw the weakling sprawling
across the floor teevas brows arched
with interest at the effortless ease with
which ki-gor handled the armored officer

  why should an empress concern her-
self with such carrion asked ki-gor
for all his ancestry wouldnt it be wiser
to give your attention to servants who
have your oavn good at heart

  you hardly understand said teeva
matter-of-factly within three moons i
must marry it is the ancient law she
glanced out of the window a wicked smile
gathering at the corners of her mouth
until you came it seemed that tal wrould
have to be my choice as husband natur-
ally i did everything possible to make him
look like less an idiot than he is

  tal wras thunderstruck by her words
his dead-white pallor changed to green

  until he came he exclaimed by
all the gods what do you mean what
has he to do with us 

teeva turned coolly to the

two guards standing behind her es-
cort him to his house she ordered and
see that he remains there out of sight
as the two blacks advanced on him tal
shook his clenched fists at ki-gor and the
empress in impotent rage

  you wont get away with this he
screamed sha-topat will deal swiftly
with both of you he wont let you
go back on your word then he turned
and drove out of the room ahead of the

stories

guards

  the feeling of being a pawn in some un-
seen game fastened more firmly than ever
on the jungle man and it wras nepah
standing silent and cynically amused in the
background who was guiding the in-
visible mechanations

  exactty what he asked bluntly have
i to do with changing your marriage
plans 

  teeva put her hand on his arm smiled
up at him

  everything she declared with silken
satisfaction the marriage was sha-
topats idea since my fathers death he
has gradually fastened his coils about me
and this was his final move to make me no
more than a puppet

  her fingers tightened on the white
lords arm

  but by your very existence you will
destroy his crushing hold on atlantis and
discredit the whole priestcraft theyve
held us all even the imperial household
in bondage

  the two remaining guards had taken
up their stations beside the door helene
and the chieftains gathered about teeva
listening warily as she related how the
priests originally had gotten the populace
under their thumb following the first
empires destruction

  they saw their opportunity and made
the most of it she continued they
drummed home the idea that raa de-
stroyed atlantis because the people had
turned their faces from him refusing to
heed and properly honor the priests who
were his earthly representatives

  it was the priests she said who had
sealed the second empire off from the
world making it a crime punishable by
death for anyone outside their order to
venture out of the hidden stronghold

  perhaps in the beginning they were
sincere in trying to protect atlantis from
the black barbarians and give it time to
regather its strength she stated frankly
but that was long long ago now their
entire purpose is to perpetuate their power
and rich easy life now i can prove that
while they kept the imperial family im-
prisoned here while they smothered the
growth and progress of my people other
colonies free of their lying prophecies and
divine decrees were prospering in the
beast-gods of atlantis	

outer world

  her lips were parted her breath coming
fast there was a question in ki-gors
eyes and he looked at helene if condi-
tions were as bad as teeva painted them
wouldnt he be doing wrong not to aid
her in unseating the priestcraft from a
personal angle he already had a score to
settle with sha-topat the high priest had
declared war on the jungle man before he
set foot in the city and it wasnt in ki-
gors nature ever to forgive a cowardly
attack

the white lord at that moment
became conscious of nepahs intent
scrutiny he looked up to find that the
officer had come quietly up beside the
empress as she talked and the look he
surprised on nepahs face was strangely
tense and strained

  at the time the jungle man put down
the officers expression to feelings against
the priestcraft aroused by teevas story
but later he was to recall that look and
put a different interpretation on it

  if my wife and i are such a threat to
the priests ki-gor pointed out guard-
edly i hardly think they will greet us
as long lost cousins why should they
accept nothing- more than a white skin as
proof that the blood of atlantis flows in
our veins would you do it if it meant
your ruin 

  teeva frowned sha-topat and his
pack have no choice she stated only
the children of raa are white surely you
dont expect him to try to twist a fact
like that

  better than most ki-gor could under-
stand how narrow and limited was teevas
idea of the outside world his own idea of
it had once consisted of no more than the
jungle where he grew to boyhood he
looked helplessly at helene

  but before he could say more he heard
the muffled distant sound of trumpets
teevas red lips thinned showing the
straight white line of her teeth

  he wastes no time in coming she
said let us go into the throne room
this is once i will enjoy seeing the high
priest of raa and with a quick lithe
stride she went toward the door

  ki-gor hesitated not liking the decep-
tion into which he was being hurried no

matter how worthy its end might be

  we really havent too much choice
helene whispered with the priests al-
ready after our heads weve got to play
along with teeva im as bewildered as
you but i do know weve got to have
somebody on our side in this crazy place
i want a look at this sha-topat any-
way ki-gor answered gruffly still re-
fusing to commit himself lets go
nepah let the jungle couple and the two
chieftains go past him before he moved
then he drew a long deep breath and
turned after them the odd strained look
 his face changed to one of relief

  teeva led the way through two small
rooms apparently used for conference
purposes went down a hall past a door
opening into an ornate bedchamber and
paused in a curtained arch

  wait here until i summon you she
told ki-gor youll be able to see and
hear without being seen

  as she slid through the curtains the
white lord held them apart a few inches
and stared after her he was looking into
an immense square room lit by scores
of torches set in brackets along the walls
the floor was polished black marble the
walls milky white the ceiling a checker-
board combination of the two colors

  at the end of the room where ki-gor
stood a huge gold medallion symboliz-
ing the sun was set in the ceiling sitting
directly beneath it on a raised block of
white marble was teevas throne a mas-
sive benchlike chair of black wood worked
with shining gold the low-backed throne
was the only piece of furniture in the
entire room

  and ki-gor got his first opportunity
to see teevas courtiers and their ladies
both men and women were slight-statured
with a frail inbred look despite their
bright armor and many-colored capes the
men for the most part had that feminine
unconvincing appearance of girls dressed
as warriors for a pageant the women
many of them heavily made up were like
replicas of the same empty-faced doll

  the languid hum of the courtiers con-
versation quickened as the empress en-
tered the room as one person they knelt
remaining on one knee until she had
settled herself on the dais then like a
gaudy swarm of butterflies they drifted
jungle stories

 

in toward the throne

  from the black guards stationed every
fifteen feet along the walls six giant na-
tives detached themselves and came to
stand between the empress and her sub-
jects

  through the open doors at the end of
the room the brazen tones of the trumpets
sounded again very close this time ki-
gor could see teevas profile she was
perfectly composed her face giving no
hint of the bombshell she meant to explode
for the high priests benefit

then into the throne room marched
the first of sha-topats retinue
the trumpeters were in the fore six
swaggering blacks wearing lion skins
thrown across the shoulders their golden
trumpets held before them like glittering
weapons next came ten priests in double
file pink-faced well-fed men magnificent-
ly gowned in rich yellow robes they
were followed by a dozen native guards
splendid in golden helmets and breastplates
big scarred fellows with the walk of cats
and the faces of devils

  ki-gor couldnt help but contrast the
calculated pomp of this entrance with the
way teeva had gone into the throne room
alone and unannounced one might as well
wonder who was sovereign here

  as this thought passed through the
jungle lords mind sha-topat stepped
through the door becoming immediately
the center of all eyes he wasnt at all
as ki-gor had imagined him

  he was tall a good five inches taller
than any person in the throne room he
wore a sweeping black robe with a cir-
cular design of the sun emblazened across
the chest this gaunt big-boned man had
none of the paunchy softness of the lesser
priests

  his stride was long quick aggressive
he walked with his broad slightly stooped
shoulders angled forward as though by
sheer physical force he would drive
through any obstacle erected to stop him

  there was a restless movement of his
hands even as he walked a steady opening
and closing of the fingers a twisting of
the wrists and ki-gors quick eyes went
to them before they touched sha-topats
face for much of a man is told by his
hands and these seemed strikingly ill-

suited to a person of the high priests
size and character

  in contrast to his long powerful arms
his hands were oddly small and frail look-
ing the puffy fingers like short fat
squirming grubs

  it was hard to relate those hands to
the mans heavy-featured immobile face
he had a broad high brow deeply cut by
a perpetual frown his iron-grey hair
confined by a gold circlet fell to his
shoulders his eyes so light a brown as to
appear yellow were sunk deep in large
bony sockets further shadowed by the
bristling black eyebrows above them the
gauntness of his cheeks served to em-
phasize the predatory quality of his beaked
nose and thin wide mouth his chin was
hidden by a wiry square-cut beard

  with an iritating arrogance the high
priests entourage bore straight down the
center of the room toward the throne the
hundred-odd courtiers gathered in a loose
group before teeva were forced to break
apart leaving an open lane for the new-
comers

  twenty feet in front of the empress
the procession halted all except for sha-
topat knelt in hollow obeisance he
granted his ruler no more than a perfunc-
tory inclination of his head then at a sig-
nal from teeva that they should rise the
long double file of trumpeters priests and
guards broke apart into two single lines
leaving a protected aisle for their master
to follow in approaching the throne ap-
parently a person as holy as the high
priest had to be protected from jostling
contact with ordinary mortals

  and as ki-gor noted though sha-topat
kept his face toward the empress his eyes
beneath the shaggy brows probed right
and left among the crowd he seemed
guardedly searching for something or
someone

  teeva watched him approach a faint
smile pouting her sensual lips two visits
in one and the same day she said em-
phasizing the fact that the high priest
was breaking precedent by this appearance
the empress of atlantis is honored in-
deed what great matter brings you to
the palace again o chalice of raa

  her light manner immediately brought
surprised looks from the watching nobles
though to an outsider her tone and w-ords
beast-gods of atlantis



might seem commonplace enough clearly
to them it sounded like open mockery but
if sha-topat was aware of any difference
in her attitude toward him he betrayed no
sign of it

  o daughter of the sun he intoned
i come on a serious mission one which
i would discuss with you in private
oh she said affecting mild surprise
and what could be so serious as to call
for privacy i had thought that you en-
joyed doing your thunderings in public
this was no hidden mockery though
her voice was yet mild her gibe was un-
derstandable to all sha-topat did prefer
to humiliate her in public openly display-
ing the fact that his authority was greater
than hers an instantaneous stir rippled
the crowd

  sha-topat though was undisturbed by
her interruption the matter i come on
is not one for jesting o empress serious
signs and portents occurred in the temple
when the regular sacrifice to raa was
made at high noon omeais of the most for-
bidding kind

  he threw back his head stared mean-
ingfully at her he was a forceful dra-
matic figure in his long black robe

  before proclaiming their meaning to
the people he said with an insinuating soft-
ness i deemed it-shall we say-best to
inform the ruler of atlantis of these
omens it could well be that they are con-
cerned with your-ah-immediate future
he paused significantly his eyes were
yellow flames in their cavernous sockets
as he held teevas glance

v

before the high priest

even knew the moves teeva intended
against him he was countering with an
attack of his own ki-gor could see that
he was a wily dangerous foe by the very
fact that he made no mention of the jungle
couples presence in atlantis he was tell-
ing teeva that either she would talk to
him in private about the strangers or he
would loose a mysterious lightning bolt of
his own on her

  but teeva was amused not frightened
by the threat he voiced she had seen how
swiftly his eyes had gone in search of ki-
gor and helene had noted the faint re-

laxation of his stern features when he was
certain no public introduction of the white
strangers had yet been made

  isnt it strange sha-topat she said
i have been toying with the notion of an
announcement to the people myself she
laughed huskily they will be quite over-
come with so much attention wont they
her face sobered as a rule they dont
get too much notice from either one of
us

  the high priest drew himself erect
then you refuse me he asked ominous-
ly-

  teeva laughed silently oh no she
said you may have your audience in
fact i rather look forward to it she
gave a careless wave of her hand be-
gone all of you she commanded and
i mean guards and priests alike

  the courtiers and their ladies and the
empress guards along the walls immedi-
ately started for the door however not a
single one of sha-topats retainers so
much as moved until their master himself
half-turned and motioned them to leave it
was yet another insulting way  which
the priesthood made it plain that their
only allegiance was to their own high
priest

  when the great doors had been swung
shut for almost a minute the priest and
the girl faced each other in silence so
far as the frowning black-robed man
knew they were alone

  well coolly asked teeva

  sha-topats face was hard im a
direct man he snapped ill waste no
words you will turn these strangers over
to me immediately you will reinstate tal
to his former place in your guards and in
your personal favor then both of
us will promptly forget that these two
foolish matters ever happened

  teeva studied her fingernails

  i thought you wanted to speak of signs
and portents she said calmly arent you
a little confused

  sha-topats jaw loosened he was as-
tounded by her growing effrontery he had
come to regard her as no more than one
of his servants and yet suddenly she was
acting the disdainful superior

  you must be out of your mind wo-
man he snapped roughly you seem to
be forgetting that you live your life of
	jungle

ease only through my sufferance a few
more insults and youll learn how difficult
life can be for my enemies

  the time is past when you can frighten
me sha-topat the dark-haired girl de-
clared her chin lifting belligerantly at
last ive found the medicine to rid me of
priestly leeches-to rid all atlantis if
need be

  he retreated a step before this swift
storm of words what do you mean

  i mean that from this day forth i
shall rule the second empire in fact in-
stead of in mere name she went on
the temple of raa will become a place
of worship again instead of a fortress
of evil manned by thieving scum

sha-topats wriggling crawling
fingers splayed wide as anger foun-
tained in him he lunged forward and
caught teeva by the shoulders jerking her
sideways with cruel strength

  enough he cried his voice cracking
in the empty chamber like the lash of a
kiboko the brutal native whip made of
hippo hide drunk or mad ill hear no
more from you im master here and ill
stay master he began forcing her to
her knees twisting her down with the
relentless pressure of his grip

  standing behind him in the curtained
alcove ki-gors companions couldnt see
what was transpiring although they had
heard the verbal exchange between the
priest and the empress but ki-gor saw it
all as teeva had guessed he would a
low snarl sounded deep in his throat and
in an instinctive action he went to the wo-
mans aid

  nothing was more despicable in the
white lords eyes than for a man to
mistreat a woman and this feeling of his
wasnt one of the civilized niceties taught
him by helene he was simply following
the immemorial rule of the animal world
where though the male is sovereign the
surliest brute does not vent his temper
on a female of his same species

  ki-gor didnt angle directly in toward
the throne shadow-quiet he went straight
down the room past the high priest and
then cut in behind him

  turn her loose he said loudly in
bantu or ill loosen your head on your
shoulders

stories

  sha-topat had been so intent on teeva
that he had neither seen nor heard ki-
gors approach he had felt no need for
watchfulness for it was unheard of for
anyone to dare break in on them now
he wrenched violently about his gaunt
face murderous with wrath

  the thick bristle of his brows lifted in
surprise his baleful yellow eyes locked
with ki-gors steady grey ones his wide
thin mouth twisted to reveal big ugly
teeth

  you he said and the word was like
a thrown knife the stranger

  teeva was on her knees on the dais
sha-topats brutal fingers had ripped
open the fastening on her gown so that it
had fallen from her shoulders her head
was thrown back as if in pain her long
black hair framing the whiteness of her
face and shoulders

  but what ki-gor could not know was
that despite the red mark of the priests
grip on her fair skin the look in her eyes
was one of triumph not hurt

  teeva had a knowledge of men far be-
yond her years the intuitive knowledge of
a born temptress she had guessed ki-
gor would come to her aid so she had
not only submitted without a struggle to
sha-topats mistreatment but had deliber-
ately goaded him into the attack

  by bringing the white lord into an
open clash with the high priest in their
first meeting she was assuring his alle-
giance to her side the enmity generated
between the two men in this initial con-
tact could be harnessed for her own pur-
poses

  yes im the stranger ki-gor an-
swered but its through no thanks to
you that im here cowardly attacks seem
to be a habit of yours

  scum shrilled sha-topat you dare
address the high priest of raa in that
tone the penalty in atlantis is death for
anyone who insults or threatens a priest

nepah helene and the two
chieftains had hurriedly followed
ki-gor into the room approaching from
behind the robed man

  and will you carry out the penalty
asked nepah with a mirthless laugh that
should be interesting i watched our bro-
ther here send a band of would-be execu-
beast-gods of atlantis



tioners scurrying for their holes earlier
today

  sha-topats head jerked about his
eyes narrowed viciously when he saw the
officer

  so youve come out in the open against
me at last have you nepah he spat
this time you wont get off so lightly
ive scented out your sneaking intrigues
before his hands squirmed and worked
in the folds of his robe ive been too
soft in the past ill not make that mistake
again

  helene glared contemptuously at sha-
topat and then while he wras still talking
stepped up on the dais and went to the
empress with gentle strength she helped
her to her feet straightened her gown

  youve deserted your post the priest
raged on and worse youve let danger-
ous strangers penetrate into the heart of
atlantis

  dangerous mocked nepah danger-
ous to whom  certainly not to the second
empire when the people hear his story
they  hail him as a savior the officer
smiled bitterly of course how they will
regard the holy servants of raa after that
will be something else again

  sha-topat seemed momentarily con-
fused he looked quickly from ki-gor to
the empress taking short nervous back-
ward steps along the dais so he could
better regard them

  ive warned you against this renegade
officer teeva he said hoarsely a dozen
times he has caused trouble i know whats
been in his heart all these years he thinks
to win the throne for himself to trample
over those who stand above him in rank
and seize the crown no matter if he tears
the empire apart doing it

  in a strikingly unpriestly gesture he
spat twice on the floor as though to clear
a nasty taste from his mouth he jabbed
the air with his arms hes done for him-
self he declared but by acting swiftly
perhaps we can save you o daughter of
the sun from being destroyed by this
terrible indiscretion

  nepah watched the high priest go into
this act with sardonic amusement i sup-
pose he drawled that you mean no
breath of this scandal must ever reach the
ears of the people you will see that every-
one connected with it-excepting the em

press you are so loyal to-will disappear
abruptly he probed his cheek with his
tongue

  exactly snapped sha-topat for
the empress sake it will be as if the
whole thing had never happened

teeva glided toward him the strange
dark fires swirling and twisting in
her eyes how thoughtful and generous
youve become she said in a deceptively
soft voice by your actions of a moment
ago i could have sworn you werent my
friend

  the sarcasm and the girls look made
sha-topat hesitate but he quickly re-
covered

  i dont deny that were often at odds
daughter of the sun he said smoothly
and unfortunately im only a rough-
handed priest instead of a courtier too
crude and direct in my anxiety to see
atlantis prosper too thoughtless of court
niceties you should realize though my
devotion to the throne

  his stem features struggled to take on
a benevolent expression he willed his
twisting fingers to stillness and held out
his arms to teeva in a fatherly gesture

  why else my empress he asked
would i have rushed here if it werent
that i was terribly upset to learn of the
danger into which you were being led no
wonder i was so upset that i forgot my-
self my anger was not at you but at
those who would destroy you

  teeva snapped her fingers under his
nose

  you sing a pretty tune my little
priest she said clipping the words
angrily you must think me a fool
though to believe i could be wooed with
such lies

  the yielding helpless woman who had
submitted so meekly to sha-topats bully-
ing had undergone a startling metamor-
phosis

  this man whose life you are so anxious
to take she said pointing at ki-gor
happens to be an envoy from a lost
branch of my people

  she pressed her face closer to sha-
topat she was like a sleek well-fed cat
arched to spring at some larger duller
animal

  do you understand me she de-
	jungle

manded loudly while you and your
cursed priests have kept us entombed here
with your lies in the outside world people
of our own flesh and blood have flourished
and grown

  her red lips were drawn back to re-
veal her small white teeth sha-topat
looked at her as though he were seeing her
for the first time and indeed this was
a teeva he had never suspected existed

  where i can barely muster enough
men to officer a small slave army of
blacks she said he tells me of countless
legions of pure-blooded warriors in his
homeland look at him sha-topat she
commanded can you find me a man in
the second empire who is his match in
size and strength as to courage and skill
in battle your own skulking assassins
can attest to those qualities

  since ki-gor had told her none of these
things it was apparent that all her in-
formation came from nepali the jungle
man glanced at the officer wondering sus-
piciously just exactly what he had told
the empress when he entered her chamber
alone how much had he elaborated on
the scant information he had gleaned from
the white lord  could it be that nepah
was using both ki-gor and teeva for
his own ends

but by now the high priest had
recovered his tongue oh ho so
thats the vile trickery nepah attempts on
you he looked at ki-gor aghast any
idiot can see that this savage and his
woman are nnunkas-the native word
for albinos-freaks he has bought from
our enemies a lost branch of atlantis
indeed as if such a thing could be pos-
sible he gave a quick harsh laugh let
us see how well this supposed brother
understands the tongue of his fathers
and turning on the white lord the
robed man began to sjieak swiftly in the
language of the long-dead first empire
instead of the bantu dialect which he had
employed along with the others up to that
moment

  you see he said when ki-gor regis-
tered nothing at his words he doesnt
understand a bit of it

  nepah arched an eyebrow then i sup-
pose that also makes the empress and me
nnunkas he said wryly we didnt

stories

understand you either-or have you for-
gotten in your disturbed state that except
for a handful of your priests no one in
atlantis can speak the ancient language
like all other learning it is reserved for
the privileged few

  you are excited arent you joined
in teeva you who are always the calm
master of every situation her voice
dripped venom well you should be be-
cause at high noon tomorrow on the very
steps of your temple i mean to present
our visitors to the people of atlantis
she ran the tip of her tongue along her
lips it was a feline gesture of relish

  i will tell them the truth about you
holy men i will tell them what you tried
to do today page will unite them behind
me-rage and the knowledge that a new
glory dawns for atlantis

  with a triumphant toss of her head
she stepped back rested an arm on the
massive gold-worked chair

  and before sunset tomorrow an em-
bassy will be on its way into the outside
world to call my lost people to me
even realizing her complete ignorance
of what lay outside atlantis ki-gor was
amazed that teeva should be so naive as
to think that after centuries of independ-
ence any people would hurry to accept her
domination and sha-topat revealed a
greater sophistication than the empress
when he seized on this same point the
high priest had seen that bluff and de-
ception had no effect on teeva that son
of darkness nepah had done his work
too well

  youre walking in a dream world he
said belligerently should you carry out
this crazy plan-which i promise you ill
never let happen-youd be destroying the
second empire and yourself in one stroke
instead of being the conqueror youd find
yourself the conquered

  he stabbed a finger at ki-gor

  look at this man whatever his ori-
gins he is obviously a savage living on
no higher plane of life than those two
blood-thirsty blacks who pad at his heels
open our gates to his kind and youll see
atlantis sacked and looted and a blonde
barbarian will rule over the ruins with
you as just another one of his miserable
slave girls

  ilis hands never still crawled and
beast-gods of atlantis



twisted over the black folds of his robe
he hunched forward with the intensity
of his rapidly hurled words he reminded
her of the vast temple treasures wealth
dating back to the days of the first em-
pire he spoke of the culture which had
been kept unchanged since the ancient
days he spoke of their rigid caste system
which had kept the same noble houses 
top since the distant day they landed in
africa

  his voice softened come now my
empress would you destroy all this
merely because your youthful mind lias
been poisoned against me by a wild-eyed
officer 

  there was a lengthening silence as
teeva looked at him

  tomorrow at high noon my people will
learn the truth she said in slow precise
accents it is a fitting time the opening
of the festival of raa the dav of re-
birth

siia-topat turned white with anger
nothing he had said had swayed her
he actually shook for several moments
so violent were the emotions seething
within him

  but he controlled himself finally and in
a surprisingly polite voice said i know
when i am beaten o daughter of the
sun since your mind is made up i will
struggle against you no longer he took
a deep sighing breath harbor no bitter-
ness against me for what i have said or
done today or in the past though i may
seem a harsh and willful man believe me
i have always acted for what i believed
were the best interests of the empire i
will prove that to you now

  he stepped from the dais to the floor
bent his head to the empress teeva and
nepah both were openly surprised by
his complete surrender

  you have wished to be rid of me

o	empress he said quietly actually
that is why you are taking this terrible
step therefore let me make you an offer
dont do this awful thing and i promise
you will be rid of me finally and for-
ever

  hope flamed in teevas eyes you
mean    she said lettiug the sentence
trail away unfinished

  i mean if it will prevent the destruction
of atlantis he said hoarsely i will
gladly destroy myself

  no warned nepah this must be
another of his tricks

  sadness and weariness mingled in sha-
topats hard face how can there be any
trickery when by midnight tonight you
will have ample opportunity to assure
yourself that i am dead he demanded
bitterly from here i will go straight to
the temple to prepare myself to meet
the great god raa at midnight i will
offer myself up as a sacrifice

  he looked away into a far corner of
the room all arrogance and fight were
gone from him

  you may view my body then on the
altar he said thickly or-if you wish
to withhold the last vestiges of respect
from me-i can leave orders that my re-
mains be borne here for your inspection
his eyes calmly met nepahs now can
you think of any further ways in which
i should abase myself

  he failed to embarrass nepah ill
believe youre dead when i see it not be-
fore he said flatly

  hes not asking us to change our
plans teeva told the officer i think for
once he is speaking the truth after all if
he goes back on his word hell only be
gaining a few more hours of life which i
meant to allow him anyway if he doesnt
die by his own hand ill go  and intro-
duce our guests she shrugged her shoul-
ders we have nothing to lose

  sha-topat inclined his head again in the
slight gesture of respect he backed an-
other two paces away from the throne
which brought him parallel with ki-gor

  wait nepah called what about his
successor the priestcraft must agree to
let you name the next high priest we
wont be gaining a thing if we dont put
 one of our own men to clean out that
hieves den

  sha-topat glowered at this last demand
but offered no resistance in my helpless-
ness i must agree he muttered

  very well sha-topat teeva said
then theres no need for you to take up
any more of my time as soon as im
notified of your death ill come to the
temple appoint the new high priest and
dictate some major changes
	jungle

  ki-gor found himself feeling almost
sorry for the robed man sha-topat hesi-
tated awkwardly seemingly bewildered by
the swiftness of his downfall by the lack
of any shadow of sympathy on the em-
press face

  teeva didnt give him another look
with a perfunctory wave of her hand she
said nepah see him to the door

ki-gor watched teeva seat
herself on the ancient throne of at-
lantis her eyes were alight her lips half-
parted and a curious cruelty was in her
smile despite the womans sheer animal
beauty the wtiite lord at this moment
felt revulsion for her

  as representatives of a civilization that
was flourishing long before other nations
were even born he had expected these
people to be gentle cultured with their
ruler an especially humane and enlightened
leader but he found himself in a harsher
far more dangerous environment than the
fang-ruled jungle deeps

  for all her talk of freeing her people
and restoring the empires glory teevas
unhesitatingly had agreed to continue her
countrys isolation if only she gained com-
plete dominion

  immersed in thought of her triumph
she was unaware of his scrutiny until
his deeply masculine voice recalled her

  and what of us o teeva asked the
white lord somehow we seem to have
been forgotten in the bargaining

  she looked at him absently forgot-
ten 

  nepah had come back in time to hear
ki-gors questions before the empress
could collect her thoughts he answered
smoothly why of course not my
friend he turned toward teeva but
lets not waste our time in more talk the
occasion calls for a celebration the best
food and drink in the palace

  ki-gor didnt like the way his inquiry
was turned off

  we are ready to drop with weariness
he said but before we think of rest
wed like to know whether you mean to
abandon us as completely as you have
your brave dream of a reborn atlantis
acid was in his voice

  teeva showed displeasure at his frank-

st okies

ness im afraid i dont understand she
said stiffly

  i believe you do he retorted your
part of the bargain with sha-topat was
to keep your people ignorant of our pres-
ence i want to know whether you mean
to give us safe passage out of atlantis
or exactly what fate we should expect

  the girls mouth tightened once more
nepah intervened to answer for her but
his low easy laugh was at variance with
her look

  oh ho he chuckled i see now what
he means he thinks we might be un-
grateful enough to have him quietly put
out of the way since he is no longer
needed as a weapon against the priest-
craft

  he clapped the jungle man heartily on
the back

  have no fear he went on the
daughter of the sun isnt one to trade
two valuable gems for a worthless bauble

  teevas features relaxed though the
sharpness remained in her eyes aye
she agreed sha-topats life lost its value
when you appeared you doomed him for
the people would have slain him once they
learned of the outer world id be a fool
to let myself be held by any promises
made to him i pretended to agree merely
because suicide is by far the easier way of
being rid of him when he is out of the
picture and i have full control of the
priestcraft then ill do exactly as i
please

  though the two meant to reassure ki-
gor the effect of their words was just the
opposite they were utterly without prin-
ciples by his unyielding code for once
the white lord gave his word on any
matter only death could keep him from
carrying it out but teeva and nepah
were willing to adopt any course ride
before any wind which would bring them
more swiftly to their objective

  i see he said as though wholly satis-
fied he had realized suddenly it would
be better not to let them suspect how little
he trusted them

  but inwardly he did some fast figuring
even if teeva had no notion of opening
atlantis to the outside world he and his
companions could be certain of good
treatment for at least one more day and
probably for several days
beastgods of atlantis



  politely therefore the jungle man asked
that they be shown to sleeping quarters
the empress seemed reluctant to let them
go but nepah supported them by relating
the grueling experiences they had under-
gone that day

  theyll be quite safe your majesty he
said ill post some of my most trusted
men to protect them during the night

vi

but as nepah led them by
back halls to their rooms the white
lord wondered whether the guards
werent cast more in the roles of jailers
than protectors he knew the same thought
was in the minds of helene and the two
chieftains but he saw no sense in fanning
their fears

  the nervous and physical strain they
had endured since morning had left them
so bone-weary that once nepah had gone
and they had relaxed they were too tired
to be very interested in the food which he
thoughtfully had secured for them

  they were quartered in two small ad-
joining rooms ki-gor chose for helene
and himself the room which contained the
only door into the outer hall the door
had a heavy bar inside which reassured
ki-gor also each room had a large win-
dow looking down on a stone court three
stories below the wall all the way to the
ground was smooth and windowless

  sleep quickly came to both of them the
light wary napping of the hunted at first
but as their utter weariness asserted itself
they slid deeper and deeper into the nerve-
less sleep of exhaustion

  in the hours before midnight ki-gor
did rouse briefly twice the first time it
was a muffled cry from ngeeso which
brought him struggling up through layers
of sleep as the slurred unintelligible
murmuring continued the jungle man re-
alized the little chieftain was only dream-
ing of some battle or hunt and he was
asleep again before the pygmy quieted

  the second time he was awakened by a
mounting bustle and stir all about them in
the palace he blinked at the window saw
that it was still night then he raised on
one elbow listening slowly he remem-

-j ungle-summer

bered that teeva was to go to the temple
at midnight realized it would be typical of
her to go with all the trappings of her
station with a sigh he lay back again
and had no memory of the empress
entourage leaving

  a deepening silence fell over the emp-
tied palace outside ki-gors door the
black guards relaxed there was no move-
ment in the shadowy halls except the eerie
dance of shadows cast by the infrequent
torches

  the two false alarms automatically made
ki-gor less vigilant that part of his mind
which kept watch for danger signals grew
less willing to accept alarms sent in by his
senses like a sleeping animal ki-gors
nose usually remained sensitive to the
scents about him his ears continuing to
sift the night noises

  but the empress departure meant she
had received the message that sha-topat
was dead therefore the jungle man felt
he no longer had to worry about a murder
attempt by the priestcraft and teeva
would be too occupied for the next few
hours to concern herself with her well-
guarded prisoners

  thus lulled by fatigue and a false feel-
ing of security ki-gor failed to hear the
faint scuffling noises outside his window
a dark muffled shape slid down into the
opening balanced a moment on the win-
dow frame and then dropped softly inside
the rope released by the figure wavered
and moved in the dim light

  almost immediately the bulk of another
man dropped into view felt for the win-
dow frame and moved inside one after
another they came in rapid order until
eight men stood within the room

  they seemed untroubled by the black-
ness the man who had first entered went
swiftly to the door satisfied himself that
it was locked he whirled came back to
the bed motioning to the others with his
arm as though they had been carefully
coached beforehand one black remained
at the window another hastened to the
door separating ki-gors room from that
of the chieftains while the others ad-
vanced on the bed

  ki-gor was stirring now muttering in
his sleep disturbed by the harsh scent of
the men then abruptly he opened his
eyes the three men who had come to his
	jungle

side of the bed were almost upon him

he stared dumbly blindly for
a fraction of time his reflexes
clogged by sleep he saw the attacker
nearest his head draw back his right fist
for a blow the mists in his brain ex-
ploded apart as he realized what was oc-
curring

  the white lord writhed with sudden
violence and the blow missed thudding
into the bed pie started up grasping for
the naked knife hed left beside the bed
as his fingers grasped the weapon the
three robed figures were on him pounding
at him with their fists straining to batter
him into quick insensibility his knife
w-as torn from his hand and fell to the
floor

  helenes fear-stricken scream tore at his
eardrums the sleeping girl was being
snatched up by the three men on her side
of the bed too bewildered to clearly under-
stand what was happening she only knew
that hands were clawing at her in the
darkness locking cruelly over her arms
and legs

  she tried to fight but her strength was
nothing against the brute power of the
men terror seared her she screamed
again and then a hand was clapped over
her mouth and she felt herself rushed to-
ward the window

  the men paused there wrenching her
arms behind her and lashing them together
with a rawhide strip one of them reached
out the window snatched in a rope from
which dangled a leather harness with
lightning speed he slipped the straps over
her shoulders snapped the belt closed
about her waist

  the same man gave a quick jerk on the
rope then the three of them shoved her
out of the window the harness cut into
her skin and she swung dizzily along the
face of the wall feeling herself being
pulled upward in uneven jolting tugs

  ki-gor was carried backward by the
concerted rush of his attackers bowled
over before he could get his feet under
him the bed splintered and broke under
their weight his body was a pulsing mass
of pain as knees and fists rained punish-
ment on him

  a lesser man would have lain helpless
stupified by that brutal hammering but

stories

helenes first scream had struck him like
an electric shock as he fell backwards
the pain he felt was as nothing to the red
fury against these murderous night-
prowlers which that cry evoked in him

  a berserk roar burst from his lips they
tried to hold him but they couldnt all
the insane tearing might of his giant-
thewed frame seemed to erupt at once
he flogged about the collapsing bed like
a wounded python tearing free of their
frantic hands

  he used his forearms like clubs he
kicked one man half across the room and
fought up to his knees he was almost
free of them when helene screamed for
the second time

  prematurely instinctively he turned to
go to her and like savage wild dogs the
men were on him again pitching him for-
ward onto the stone floor by breaking his
furious counterattack when he did he lost
all the ground he had gained once more
he was under them absorbing a terrible
beating

  the sound of their battling filled the
room ki-gor was snarling and roaring
like a beast and though his attackers never
once cried out in either hurt or rage ex-
plosive grunts and odd rasping sounds
burst from their throats

  then came wild shouts and a brief
furious clash of steel as ngeeso and
tembu george plunged into the room
cutting down the robed man who tried to
bar their entrance the four men who had
just swung helene out of the window
whirled around two of them drawing
swords and running to halt the chieftains
the others rushing to help subdue the
white lord

ki-gor had fought to his feet
again he saw helene being lifted
upward outside the frame of the win-
dow he smashed his huge fist into the
face of the nearest black there was the
snap of bone and the contorted features
suddenly collapsed and gave like jelly
the man gave a queer disjointed leap
and falling began to flop underfoot like
a beheaded chicken

  men were clinging to ki-gors back his
arms his legs a single thought was in
his mind-to reach helene before she was
drawn from view he plunged forward
beast-gods of atlantis



the strength of a bull gorilla in his charge
for one two three paces he carried the
whole mass of them with him

  then they slowed him in a frenzy of
despair he tried to fling them off he
crushed a mans throat with his bare fin-
gers but his legs were beginning to give
under the strain trembling beneath his
like bursting flares dazzling lights kept
exploding in his brain as the murderous
hammering he was absorbing took its toll

  suddenly they knocked his legs from
beneath him he went down under the
mass for an instant they swarmed
around and over him like ants about a
stricken bug then lifting together they
heaved him up between them and rushed
for the window

  he struggled fiercely but at last they
had the advantage they had sought and
they got him across the room however
there were only four of them now and
when one of them had to release his grip
to try to lash ki-gors wrists he tore
free again as soon as his feet touched the
floor his fingers closed on the nearest
man and he reared to his full height threw
the robed black hurtling out of the open
window

  the three remaining blacks leaped away
from him grunting like angered hogs
when they saw their fellow thrown to
his death into the stone court they knew
then that they would never be able to
get the white lord into the harness dang-
ling outside the sill and assailing their
ears was a rising clamor outside the door
as teevas shouting guards battered at the
thick wooden planking with some kind of
improvised ram

  immediately their reluctance to use
weapons against him vanished if they
couldnt take him alive at least they would
chop him to bits before making their
escape from scabbards hidden beneath the
folds of their robes they snatched out
short thick swords

 they had the unarmed jungle lord
hemmed against the window there wasnt
a chance he could get past them without
sustaining a fatal wound and behind him
was a sheer three-story drop the faint
cold sheen of starlight falling on their
greasy sweaty faces revealed the bestial
rage which gripped them the insanely
stubborn white man had frustrated their

carefully laid plans they hungered for
his death

  but his strange calmness his utter lack
of fear held them at bay for a moment
and that moment was time enough for
twin devils to smash out of the darkness
behind them screaming kill kill

  accustomed to no more than a pretense
of resistance from black men the night-
raiders had been confident that their two
swordsmen could dispatch tembu george
and ngeeso or at least hold them at bay
for as long as was necessary too late
they discovered that the masai and pygmy
chieftains were of a different mettle than
the men of atlantis with the skill gar-
nered from innumerable battles in their
attack the chieftains had made quick work
of their arrogant opponents leaving them
choking in their own blood as they leaped
to ki-gors assistance

two of the three raiders
threatening ki-gor died before they
could make a move ngeesos spear
sheared open the belly of one and tembu
george cut the whole top of the skull
away from the other the third mans
eyes started from his head he gurgled
with terror and bounded toward the win-
dow slashing at the white lord

  the jungle man jumped aside the
black made no attempt to strike at him
again the man wras intent on escape he
leaped for one of the ropes down which
he and the others liad come dropping his
sword as his hands reached for it

  the momentum of his body swung him
far outward away from the wall like a
startled monkey he skittered upward on
the rope straining to get beyond reach
before he should swing back

  and his frantic efforts were successful
for though ki-gor sprang up on the win-
dow sill as the rope swayed back he found
that the black was safe inches above his
fingers

  with a snarl ki-gor caught the rope
looped it about his hands he swayed back
bracing his feet against the ledge drawing
the rope taut great muscles writhed into
a tortured outline across his bowed back
strained out along his arms an agony of
effort contorted his features it seemed his
heart must burst with the terrible effort
	jungle

he laid on it

  then all at once the rope gave snapping
inward with the violence of a released
rubber band the white lord staggered
back and would have fallen wrhen he
landed in the room if tembu georges hand
hadnt steadied him

  help me hold it he cried

  the chieftains caught the slack which
lay curled over the sill hurtling down
past the window his face frozen with fear
came the raider who had tried to escape
he was still gripping the rope his muscles
bunched with the effort of climbing

  ki-gor and his two friends braced
themselves withstood the shock as the
rope snapped taut a few yards from the
window miraculously the raider managed
to hold on but his desperate efforts to
save himself were expended in vain past
the window shot the flailing body of one
of the hitherto unseen blacks who had
been anchoring the line on the roof he
had been foolish enough to tie several loops
around his waist and ki-gor had dragged
him over the edge

  as the second black fell he clawed at
the man on the rope wanting to cling to
anything which would break his death-
plunge he tore the raider away from the
line and like grappling cats they plum-
meted downward

  then as though a giant whip had been
snapped they came to the end of the rope
the one who was securely tied gave a
huge bounce and lay joggling and spinning
in mid-air the other black though was
torn free and dove on head first into the
stone courtyard

  withstanding the arm-tearing jolt ki-
gor and his companions waited for feeling
to come back into their strained muscles
and then drew their limp catch up to the
window they had stretched him on the
floor and cut the constricting line away
from his stomach when the door crashed
open and guards came stampeding into
the room

the chieftains and the white
lord sprang up ready for battle
many of the guards carried torches and
as they saw the grim dangerous faces of
the three men at the window they halted
hold cried their leader we fight

stories

for you not against you his glance took
in the crumpled forms of the dead raiders
are you outlanders mad not to open the
door so we could aid you

  ki-gors eyes were grey steel there
was no time for that he snarled but if
there had been how could one tell in this
place of treachery that your swords
wouldnt be against us too youre
teevas guards arent you well this
has all the mark of her doing

  the tall scarred guard leader looked
astonished he pointed at one of the life-
less raiders

  those are sha-topats devil men he
exclaimed even you should know that
he has spies among our men in the palace
yes thats how he knew so quickly the
room where you slept

  i hardly think sha-topat is interested
in u anymore declared ki-gor he was
still tense ready for trouble did the
fools think he didnt know the high priest
was dead

  the guard leader shook his head in ex-
asperation have your own way then
he said angrily since by some miracle
the devils seem to have brought harm to
no one but themselves i wont argue with
you

  to no one but themselves shouted
ki-gor you blind toad they kidnapped
my wife while youre babbling here she
may be dying

  shock ripped the blacks countenance
by the stern laws of atlantis his life
would be forfeit for losing so valuable a
prisoner

  but how    he began then he saw
the rope he ran to the window and lean-
ing far out stared upward he whirled
back toward his men shouting orders that
sent small groups of them sprinting for
a half dozen different stairways to the
roof sent runners to alert the skeleton
force left behind in the palace by the
empress

  his frantic reaction swept away ki-
gors growing suspicion that teeva was
behind the plot

  of all times to have this happen
cursed the native there are a thousand
rat-holes in this stinking ruin for them
to disappear into and there arent a hun-
dred men in the palace to use in our
search
beast-gods of atlantis	

  thats why i hauled this one in ex-
plained ki-gor pointing to the uncon-
scious raider it wont take long to bring
him around and by all the gods i swear
hell talk fast about where they are taking
helene or ill break every bone in his
body if we act swiftly enough we can
trap them before they get out of their
robes

  the guard shook his head impatiently
you wasted your time he said sha-
topat makes certain his devil-men wont
betray him

  he stepped closer to the senseless raider
and with a brutal jab of his spear butt
forced open the mans lax jaws

  his trained killers are all this way he
said

  ki-gor looked into the thick-lipped
mouth and his face tightened he under-
stood why the raiders fought and died in
silence the blacks tongue had been ait
out later he was to learn that the priests
took the children of slaves and deliberately
moulded them into beasts of prey bring-
ing them up in a cult of terror and death

  they must have wanted you and your
wife badly though the guard went on
to strike so openly and recklessly they
usually risk no chance of failure

  ki-gors hopes of trailing helene had
been fastened on the prisoner he doesnt
need a tongue to lead us he gritted
well make him do it

  but even as he spoke the supposedly
unconscious raider flipped over on his
hands and knees leaped between ngeeso
and tembu george like a great frog and
dove out the window

  if it hadnt been that way it would
have been some other said the guard
with an irritating matter-of-factness
they always kill themselves when they
are certain there is no escape he wouldnt
have helped you no matter what tortures
you used

the warriors air of resigna-
tion infuriated the white lord if
he had known how the prisoner would
react why hadnt he spoken up sooner in-
stead of trying to help he seemed con-
vinced that helene was irretrievably lost
despite his lament about how few men he
had to use in the search he had kept a

dozen guards in the room with him letting
them stand idle while he babbled his de-
featist talk

  well dont just stand here cried
ki-gor weve got to do something
take us up to the roof and lets try to
follow their spoor

  the guard leaders eyes glittered warily
he stepped backward two strides so that
he stood among his men

  oh no he said grimly im taking no
chances of losing you too youre staying
right here where youll be safe its hard
on you i know but that is the way its
going to be

  ki-gor balanced on the balls of his feet
his big fists knotted weighing his chances
to get past the hard-faced warriors

  dont try it the man warned youll
only force us to tie you up

  ki-gor slowly relaxed all right he
growled you are too many for me but
at least stay out in the hall so i dont
have to see you loafing while my wife is
being carried to her death

  tembu george and ngeeso blinked at
the white lord in amazement they had
been ready to sell their lives in cutting a
path open for him to the door never
would they have guessed that he would
back down at such a moment

  it seemed at first that the guard leader
would deny the jungle mans request but
after glancing at the shattered door and
seeing that it couldnt be closed again
he nodded agreement ki-gor stood mo-
tionless while the warriors filed into the
hall the leader had taken a place where
he could watch the white lord

  whats wrong with you demanded
ngeeso surely you are not just going
to stand here

  ki-gor turned his back to the door so
the guards couldnt see his lips move

  of course not he said gruffly now
listen closely you and i are going to
fake an argument ill accuse you of not
coming to my aid quickly enough you get
mad and stalk into your room saying you
wont stay and listen to my lies in a fit
of temper ill throw this rope after you
so it will land in the doorway out of sight
of the guards

  ngeeso pricked up his ears sensing
almost immediately ki-gors plan

  then while i walk around in here and
	jungle

hold their attention you take the rope and
lenghten it with strips of cloth from your
mattress anchor one end of it to the
frame of the bed and drop the other out
the window

  tembu georges eyes flared with eager-
ness good good he rumbled once
out of this accursed palace well turn the
city upside down

  in another minute ki-gor and ngeeso
were exchanging- angry words realistically
carrying out their mock argument sud-
denly the pygmy cried lie would hear no
more of the white lords insults and
flung into the next room in an apparent
excess of rage ki-gor scooped up the
loosely coiled rope and threw it after
ngeeso then he began pacing up and
down furiously telling tembu george how
stupid and useless the pygmy was he
paused once to recover the sword and
knife he had lost in the fight return them
to their sheaths at his waist

  after sufficient time had passed for
ngeeso to complete his work with the
rope tembu george said loudly enough
for the guards to hear perhaps he was
in the wrong but still weve got to stick
together at a time like this come now
lets make it up with him

  he went on in this conciliatory vein
until at last the white lord stopped his
pacing i guess youre right he said
its being cooped up here that made me
say those things lets go get him and
bring him back in here

  still talking they walked together to
the doorway separating the two rooms
the bed was braced against the window
the mutilated mattress lay on the floor
ngeeso had already disappeared down the
rope

  go quickly ki-gor whispered to the
masai leader

  then in case the guard should grow sus-
picious and look in from the hall the
white lord leaned against the doorjam
in plain view and began an awkward
rambling apology to the non-existent
pygmy supposedly sulking in the room

  tembu george hurried to the window
grasped the rope and disappeared from
view ki-gor watched the rope stretched
across the sill and the moment the strain
on it relaxed he ran across the room and
started down the swaying line

stories

vii

the demoniac fury which
had possessed the high priest of
raa on his return to the temple now was
subsiding the final harshly snarled order
was given the last frightened underling
sent running the die was cast sha-topat
could do no more

  so with the unshakable confidence of a
man who has never known defeat he re-
viewed for a moment as he sat alone all
he had done in the past few hours and
allowed himself a nod of approval though
the tension which attends any struggle of
magnitude wras still with him he was well
satisfied with his plans

  he slowly became aware of his thirst
and reaching out to the silver wine con-
tainer on the great rectangular table be-
hind which he sat he poured a bowl-like
silver cup to the brim lifting the cup
with both hands he emptied it with delib-
erate gulps he drank without any partic-
ular sign of enjoyment wine would
quench his thirst and renew his strength
and for that reason alone he took it

  he had nothing but contempt for the
weaknesses of ordinary men he played
on those weaknesses his hands tightened
on the empty cup only that accursed
nepah had been immune to his lures he
had tried to tempt him from his trouble-
making by offering honors position riches
then he had tried threats all attempts
had failed

  underestimating nepah had been one
of sha-topats few mistakes he usually
drew men of that type into the priest-
craft while they were young or failing
that he saw that some accident befell
them the moment opposition to his regime
began crystalizing around them

  but even in that nepah had outsmarted
him despite evidences of unusual ability
he deliberately had assumed a docile air
until he had won the friendship and loyal-
ty of the imperial guards and strangely
enough the confidence and affection of
the common people he had made himself
a hero to them an always accessible bene-
factor whereas the rest of the nobility
looked on them as dirt

  thus when nepali at last felt himself
strong enough to oppose the priestcraft he
was too much a public figure for sha-
beast-gods of atlantis



topat to dispose of easily the high priest
had chosen a more devious way by exert-
ing pressure on teeva he had gradually
reduced nepahs power in the palace and
the army edging him out of affairs reduc-
ing him in station on first one trumped-up
excuse and then another until at last he
had had the empress send him to the
frontier on permanent assignment public
blame had fallen on teeva instead of
sha-topat for the officers unfair treat-
ment

  sha-topat had thought he had the man
hopelessly pocketed and was waiting for
the army and the people to forget him
before contriving the accident which
would dispose of him permanently

  yet he realized now that teeva and the
young upstart had been in contact all the
time they had wanted him to think he
had won they had been hatching some
plot exactly what he couldnt say but it
was bound to have some connection with
the sullen unrest growing among the
people the past few moons not even the
bloody efficiency of his night raiders had
been able to crush that unrest

  the two outlanders ki-gor and helene
hadnt inspired this plot against him they
were merely convenient tools which fate
had provided nepah and teeva aye
those two had played it smart all along
but the guiding brain had been nepahs

a coldly venomous look glit-
tered in sha-topats yellow eyes
yes he had been too complacent for once
too contemptuous of an enemy but they
had brought him to his senses tonight

  what fools they were to think that he
sha-topat would ever surrender so ab-
jectly well they both were in for a
shock

  the eerie bass bray of the giant trumpet
in the main altar room was beginning to
civilized ears it would have sounded like
the dismal wailing of a foghorn to the
people of atlantis it signaled the presence
of the great god raa in the temple told
that his living spirit was speaking with the
priests

  sha-topat raised his head and listened
to the slow measured braying the voice
of the god he thought thats actually
what it is to the people his lips curled
in contempt

  he pushed away from the table and
stood up

  i am their god and the fools dont
realize it he abruptly cried aloud i
am raa and that sniveling pair thought
i would give up my power with a sweep
of his hand he knocked the wine cup
across the room

  he still stood in the same position when
a scarlet-clad priest his fat face pale
with anxiey came hesitantly through the
door sha-topat gazed fixedly at the man
noting the beads of sweat gathered on
his hog-like jowls

  so they are coming eh he said
they can be seen from the steps of
the temple fluttered the priest from
the number of torches the whole imperial
guard must be with the empress

  in the face of the mans nervousness
sha-topat seemed to grow calmer you
are quite the roaring lion nabu when
youre torturing a prisoner or flogging a
temple girl but you arent so brave when
your precious person is in a little danger
but a single slip all-highest gabbled
the fat man and well all be slaughtered
sha-topat laughed mirthlessly mo-
ments like this proved why he was the
master and these others his servants like
pale spiders his hands crept back and forth
along the edge of the table an almost sen-
sual pleasure throbbed in him

  without me what would happen to you
jackals he asked pityingly but in his
heart was pride not pity come let
us prepare to meet our guests

  he strode out of the door his black
robe flapping about long legs he hurried
down a narrow corridor to a gallery over-
looking the main altar room standing two
deep along the walls of the dark gallery
were heavily armed native warriors from
this height they could command any part
of the main temple floor with their
weapons the high priest paused finger-
ing the stone railing as his yellow eves
checked the scene below the fat priest
nabu hovered restlessly about him like an
awkward beetle unable to decide where to
alight

oha-topats glance started at the back
 of the huge chamber passing along
the kneeling rows of priests each in the
distinctive color of his order in the pauses
	jungle

between the deep eerie brays of the great
horn the sorrowful wailing of the men
could be heard

  in the front rank before the altar were
ranged as befitted their high station those
priests who wore the scarlet robes only
sha-topat held greater authority they
were the men who offered blood sacrifices
to raa who actually picked the victims
and wielded the knives when they walked
abroad men blanched with fear and wo-
men hid themselves for they were guided
by the basest motives in their selection
of victims nabu was the chief of these
executioners a lustful sadistic man who
reveled in the liberties which his job al-
lowed him

  the altar itself was a huge crystalline
slab faintly gold in color but it possessed
a property stranger than its color for
being porous it would slowly absorb the
blood spilled on it shifting in hue as it
drank until it too became a deep ugly
red

  this drinking of blood by the stone was
regarded with awe by the people doubly
so since always when they returned to the
temple the next day it had regained its
original golden color and was as translu-
cent as ever the god has drunk and been
nourished by the blood of his victims the
priests would say about their trick of
washing the pores of the stone clean with
water they said nothing and since no one
but a priest could approach the altar close
enough to inspect it none of the super-
stition-ridden worshippers had ever thought
to doubt the explanation

  and on the altar now newly slain lay
a native his warm blood filtering into the
heart of the stone

  standing behind the altar was a tre-
mendous upright statue of raa a golden
colossus dominating the entire room this
one towering figure was the only actual
statue of raa permitted in atlantis ex-
cept in the temple only the sun-symbol
could be worshipped

  the massive idol was expertly wrought
but it was no representation of beauty
and goodness the ancient craftsmen who
had fashioned the giant had caught in
metal all the ugly brute powers the lust-
ful greed-crazed emotions the repressed
evil of mankind naked and hideous and
sickening magnified and exaggerated a

stories

thousand-fold the beast-in-man was the
diety before whom the degenerate second
empire of atlantis knelt in trembling
worship

  from an opening in the ceiling above the
idol protruded the mouth of the great
horn fully ten feet across at its widest
point

  good said sha-topat theyll never
suspect a thing until it is too late he led
the way to a circular staircase started
down remember nabu he warned
hold them at the door until the trumpet is
stilled that will be the signal that my
hunting dogs have returned with the two
outlanders

  but suppose the empress pushed past
me quavered the distressed nabu you
know how headstrong she is

  the high priest snorted in disgust
not even teeva would dare interrupt the
prayer to the dead why else did i
gather all the priests and set them to
chanting if not to make it possible to
hold her as long as necessary shell be
able to see my body on the altar from that
door so she wont mind a slight delay and
it wont be more than that for the out-
landers will be rushed here through the
underground tunnels on zebras whereas
teeva has taken the round-about route
through the city in her litter

  the priest ran a fat hand over hit wet
face he bit his lip as though he had
pains in his stomach

  suppose our men fail roared sha-
topat i planned this myself therell be
no blundering this time

then they were at the bottoiri
of the steps two priests their arms
filled with gear awaited sha-topat he
hurriedly tore off the robe he was wearing

  one of the men advanced with a vest-
like garment of leather which sha-topat
donned as he buckled it tight about his
chest he looked down and smiled his good
humor restored

  the hilt of a ceremonial sword and
some five inches of blade stuck straight
out from his chest the trick knife was
fastened to the leather vest making it
appear that the high priest had stabbed
himself in addition the odd garment was
shaped to allow room inside so that he
beast-gods of atlantis



could breathe almost normally and yet at
the same time hide the rise and fall of his
chest

  next he slipped on a magnificent black
and gold robe which one of the men held
open for him but when the robe was
fastened about him the whole chest of it
was disclosed to be wet with blood the
blood of the man slain on the altar a
small slit in the front of the garment al-
lowed it to fit snugly down over the fake
sword

  now the powder said sha-topat i
must look the part but be careful not to
whiten my beard

  as they carefully applied a grey-white
pallor to his face he frowned looked
about inquiringly wheres that ridiculous
idiot tal he hasnt been forgotten has
he

  a small mincing figure hesitantly de-
tached itself from the far shadows of the
room

  i-im here all-highest tal stut-
tered but when your men rescued me
from teevas guards they wouldnt say
why you wanted me you-you arent
angry with me

  you arent important enough to be
angry about snapped the high priest
just dont wander away

  tal looked alxut him apprehensively
all this bustle-what does it mean is
there going to be any trouble

  no no said sha-topat shortly

  but me-why do you need me per-
sisted the narrow-breasted little man he
knew something dangerous was afoot and
he didnt want to be involved in it his
meeting with the white savage had been
harrowing enough to last him a lifetime

  because you little jackal i mean to
make you emperor of atlantis this
night growled sha-topat now stay
out of the way until i call for you

  and with that the high priest strode
into the main temple the priests ran
ahead of him and lifted the dead native
off the altar carried him away sha-topat
climbed up on the reddening stone lav
down on his back with his head turned
toward the door

  in the uncertain shifting light of the
torches which illuminated the temple his
sprawled black form with the knife hilt
protruding from the chest made a realistic

enough corpse

  rushing back from disposing of the
dead native nabu stopped before the altai
to inspect his master a grudging smile
of admiration wreathed his fat lips

  by the bowels of the god himself
he swore i never thought until now that
it would work but ill even believe it
myself when i see you come back to life
teevas guards will dissolve into jelly
when they see this miracle

with sudden confidence
nabu turned and scurried toward
the door he was standing on the outside
steps a sorrowful dejected figure when
teeva took nepahs arm and stepped
from her litter

  surrounded by brawny guards with
drawn swords teeva and the officer hur-
ried up the steps nabu moved in front
of them opened his arms wide

  by sha-topats last order i stand
here to receive you o daughter of the
sun he said shakily he said you might
wish to view his remains and commanded
me to oblige you

  then he is really dead asked teeva
they stood on the top step nabu turned
and pointed through the dim temple to-
ward the altar you can see him there
he who was both father and son to me
pfaugh declared nepah youve never
had a kind feeling toward anyone but your-
self he inspected the priest suspiciously
well take us on down to the altar he
said impatiently from this distance that
could be anybody lying down there

  in a thrice we can go o noble ne-
pah said nabu humbly but you
wouldnt want to interrupt the rites to
the dead it would be an affront to raa
the chant is almost ended

  you priests had the rest of the night
to carry on your gabbling muttered ne-
pah there was no rush about this cere-
mony he will be dead for a long time
but despite his grumbling both he and
teeva waited outside the temple reli-
gious taboos which have been observed
since childhood are not easily broken the
strong force of guards stirred restively
as the eerie chanting of the priestcraft
rose and fell and the unearthly roar of
the great horn thundered -out into the night
	jungle

like the voice of doom as sha-topat
had known the chanting and trumpeting
would wash against the guards like a
poisoned wind whipping up their super-
stitions and fears reviving their awe of
raa and his servants

  patience teeva soothed the officer
since this is the last time sha-topat
will ever obstruct us in anyway i can wait
quite happily there is a pleasure in hear-
ing his death chant

  within the temple a red-robed priest
entered from a side door carrying a
jeweled wand topped with a golden sphere
he approached the altar and turning his
back toward the door made ritualistic
passes of the wand over the supposed
corpse his real mission was to tell sha-
topat that the raiders had returned with
only helene and if nepah could have seen
the mans frightened face he would have
known something was wrong

  it had taken the priest quite a time to
gather up enough courage to tell sha-
topat that ki-gor hadnt been captured
and while he had delayed a second mes-
sage had come from the palace relayed
by one of the priestcrafts spies telling
that ki-gor and the two chieftains had
gotten away from teevas guards and dis-
appeared into the city

  sha-topats face swelled with rage
when he heard the report but it was too
late to stop the machinery he had set in
motion and since his own life hung in
balance he forced himself to remain calm

  we will go on as planned he said
grimly but get teeva and her warriors
into the temple quickly and close the
doors behind them so no messengers from
the palace can reach them

  his yellow eyes glared into the priests
cringing ones

  and the instant we are finished here
he said fiercely turn out every available
man priest and warrior alike to hunt
down that white savage if he isnt killed
or captured by sunrise ill see that one-
third of you jackals are put to the sword

  then arranging his face into a mask-
like calm again sha-topat dismissed the
priest as the man retreated into the ranks
of his red-robed brothers the braying of
the great horn suddenly ceased and a
fraction later the chanting of the priests
chopped off

stories

the man who had just left sha-
topat thrust his jeweled sceptre
high mercy o god of atlantis he
cried his voice ringing loud in the hushed
temple desert us not in our hour of
need strike terror among those who
would defile your temple and defy your
holy edicts

 and swelling up from the crowded
ranks of the priests came the cry hear
us o raa hear us as you always have
in the utter silence which followed this
demonstrations teeva stood stunned for a
moment then her eyes blazed and anger
ripped the calm of her face

  did you hear those dogs she ex-
claimed to nepah at a time like this
they dare defy me by all the gods theyll
suffer for this last insult and ill guar-
antee it will be their last one v

  she shoved nabu aside and stormed
through the door nepah waved the ranks
of waiting guards into the temple pro-
tect her he ordered and he ran to walk
by her side

  under ordinary circumstances the war-
riors would have gone leaping forward
of their own accord to clear a way for the
empress and shield her with their bodies
but now even with a direct order they
obeyed slowly and hesitantly fear of the
god and the merciless priests who served
him had had time to rise in them during
their wait outside the temple

  the priests moved back leaving the
center of the temple open none of them
looked at teeva or showed any awareness
of the armed men marching toward the
altar standing in utter silence they kept
their eyes focused on the black form
sprawled at the feet of the golden idol

  the line of red-robed priests before
the altar stood firm as teeva approached
forming a living barrier between her and
sha-topat

  out of my way you carrion she
burst out at them your master there
should be an example of what happens
to those who oppose me

  when they didnt budge nepah stepped
in front of her with a curse sent two of
them reeling out of the way his face
dark with blood he whipped his sword
free of its sheath this final arrogance of
the priests infuriated him

  back he snarled or raa will hav
beast-gods of atlantis

more than his fill of sacrifices

  the words were barely out of his mouth
when the thunderous bray of the great
horn shattered the air the monster in-
strument roared through the temple like
a voice of doom shaking the very stones
of the building again and again that
gargantuan blast of sound rolled and re-
verberated growing ever louder and more
unearthly

  moans and cries of fear broke from the
assembled priests teevas guards looked
nervously about them disturbed by the
feigned terror of the robed men wonder-
ing at the significance of the trumpeting

  sword in hand nepah stiffened he
knew too much about the priestcraft to be
taken in by their display of superstitious
dread but what was the purpose of their
play-acting what could they hope to
gain by this further angering of the
empress he half-turned searching the
floor of the chamber with narrowed eyes

  then he felt teevas fingers clench
tightly on his arm heard her queer
strangled cry he jerked about thinking
some threat had come from the red-robed
men but the priests were standing trans-
fixed their eyes bulging their faces
shocked and unbelieving as they stared at
he altar

  nepah looked at the blook-soaked stone
for a moment his breath caught in his
throat the dead man on the altar had
rolled over on his side and with blind
awkward and incredibly slow fumblings
was trying to get up

sha-topats eyes were glazed and
blank the awful pallor of his skin
added to the natural gauntness of his face
gave him a grisly realistic look of death
his motions at first were the futile mind-
less twitchings of a broken machine trying
to start

  the black warriors saw how the whole
front of his robe was a red wetness how
from the very center of the once-gold sun-
symbol on his chest protruded the sword
the visible guarantee that he couldnt be
alive

  and yet he was alive or coming alive
yes that was it this dead man was
coming alive that terrifying thought
seared the minds of teevas guards the



great god raa was forcing life back into
the body of the high priest

  while the trumpet thundered and the
priests wailed and screamed and prayed
sha-topat fought to his knees he still
seemed sightless utterly without knowl-
edge of anything or anybody

  his hands searched the air twitches of
pain jerked the blankness of his face his
mouth opened and closed as though moti-
vated by an agonized want for air and
yet as the blacks could see there was no
movement of his chest to indicate that
he was breathing

  teeva herself shrank back look at
him nepah look at him she gasped
how can it be a moan escaped her
lips

  and as she spoke the awful nightmare
figure on the altar reeled on upward to his
feet swaying sagging seemingly in dan-
ger of collapsing any moment

  sha-topat tilted his head back his
glazed staring eyes fastening on the ceil-
ing slowly as though drawn by invisible
strings his arms crept upward in supplica-
tion he seemed to grow and strengthen as
if taking energy from some unseen source

   abruptly the roar of the trumpet ceased
he lives he lives again raa has given
him back to us shrieked a priest

  it is a sign cried another the god
has sent him back to save atlantis from
its enemies

  aie-e-e-

  one of the red-robed priests whirled
and stabbed a finger at the empress party
down on your knees false ones lefore
raa sweeps your rotten souls into oblivion
you and your evil leaders are the ones
the god rejects

  nepah blinked like a man suddenly com-
ing awake why you dirty tricksters he
shouted

  all about him terror-stricken guards
were dropping to their knees writhing and
moaning abjectly they knew that teeva
had ordered the high priest to destroy
himself and they saw now how raa him-
self had raised up sha-topats blood-wet
corpse and in a miracle of miracles had
restored life to it to their simple minds
there could have been no more terrible
no more damning rejection of teevas
authority and ambitions the god himself
had spoken out against her
	jungle

a frenzied wildness shook
nepah as he realized what was oc-
curring he who always was so calm and
sardonic seemed to go insane screaming
incoherently he leaped for the altar jab-
bing and slashing with his sword

  but the red-robed priests had been
warned to watch him the instant he
moved they leaped forward like a pack
of dogs it was a good ten steps to the
shoulder-high altar and the agile officer
covered it with darting speed

  for all the alertness of the priests
against just such a move nepah almost
reached sha-topat if he hadnt disdained
the use of stairs built on either side of the
altar he probably would have been suc-
cessful but he chose to vault up on the
stone from the front under ordinary
circumstances it was a jump he could have
made easily but chance directed that he
should put his hands on a section slippery
with blood

  instead of lifting himself easily over the
edge his arms slid from under him and he
thudded against the side of the altar be-
fore he could leap again the priests were
clawing at him like a madman he fought
free of them he saw though that his op-
portunity to reach the high priest was
gone

  he could have turned his sword against
the red-robed pack and wreaked dreadful
havoc before they bore him under but
his one flaming thought was to cut down
sha-topat prove to teevas guards the
trickery being played on them he un-
hesitatingly gave up all chance of de-
fending himself against them to sieze on a
last fleeting hope of driving his blade into
the hated mans flesh

  as he tore away from his attackers he
grasped his sword like a javelin there
was no time for careful aim a priest
was diving for his legs even as he threw

  lets see raa send you back this time
he cricd

  he was falling then but his burning
eyes were still glued to the glinting streak
which marked the course of the sword
as he went down the distance was too
far for the blade to drive true the
weighted hilt had time to drag downwards

  and thus when the sword struck sha-
topats chest it didnt hit him point-first
with the full weight of the throw plunging

stories

it straight in the lower edge of the
blade hit him and then as it encountered
the resistance of the thick hard leather
jacket the whole momentum of the wea-
pon was transfixed into a downward lash
of the heavy hilt the sword tore free
of the leather as the hilt struck the high
priests leg

  the force of the blow sent sha-topat
staggering back but the sword fell harm-
lessly at his feet the concealed leather
jacket had saved him from injury and
best of all teevas guards thought they
had witnessed a second miracle

  as warriors they knew that the sword
blow even though glancing had had
enough force behind it to lay open an
ordinary mans chest yet the edge had
bitten into sha-topat bounced away and
he was no worse for the experience clear-
ly the hand of raa was upon him he
had been brought back from death once
and now he was beyond hurt

sha-topat turned his back on
the crowd he raised his arms in
thanks to the idol then he dropped his
hands to the sword hilt sticking from his
chest tugged the fake weapon free his
position and his guarded motions kept the
audience from actually seeing the blade
and he immediately cast it down on the
floor behind the altar before turning
around again he intoned a prayer to the
god

  swiftly now life and expression came
back to the high priest his eyes blazed
out at the assembled throng he pointed
an accusing finger at nepah who was
being held face-down by a mass of red-
robed men

  i lay the eternal curse of raa on this
man he declared and on anyone who
from this time on dares cleave to him i
decree his death on the altar tomorrow
when i went into the arms of raa think-
ing that by sacrificing myself i might
save atlantis the full evil of this trait-
orous dango was revealed to me

  and from his throne of flame the god
spoke to me in a voice that shattered the
heavens as a sign of my power and
my wrath i shall send you back he said
to cleanse atlantis and from the lowest
person in the land to the highest let my
punishment fall on all those who have con-
beast-gods of atlantis	

spired against me and my holy servants

  sha-topat turned his fierce visage on
teeva she was pale and shaken by the
bewildering turn of events but she had
no fear of bodily harm at the hands of
the priestcraft not even sha-topat would
dare slay the last descendant of the blood-
line which had ruled atlantis since beyond
the memory of man the line which had
supposedly been sired by the sun-god
himself

  and you o blind and foolish woman
he said let nepah lead you into a vile
plot against your people i thought by my
death to shock you to your senses in
shame you should go down to your knees
and cry that you repent let the people
hear how in your youth and innocence you
let yourself be ensnared in the web of this
traitor tell them that your eyes have
been opened by the god tonight and that
it is your wish too that nepah pay the
penalty for his crimes 

  the wily high priest was careful not
to place teeva in the same category with
nepah he made her seem a victim rather
than a partner of the officer and he left
her a way out of her difficulties by the
simple expedient of denouncing nepah
and admitting she had been victimized

  sha-topat knew only too well how com-
pletely self-centered the empress was
how shallow were her loyalties like most
selfish persons the principal basis of her
friendship revolved on how much a per-
son could advance her personal interests
and ambitions he had provoked her into
abandoning many supposed favorites in
his time

  teeva saw that her cringing guards
were useless or in her mood she would
have turned them loose on the priestcraft
she realized that this was the final and
deciding moment in her long struggle with
the high priest if she capitulated now
she was forever lost therefore in her
desperation she grasped for the only wea-
pon left her

  if its a confession you want she
cried shrilly let it be about the two
white outlanders in my palace-about the
two envoys from another and great colony
of my people beyond our walls who have
been lost to us since the first empires
ruin

  there was no beauty in her face then

as she shook her clenched fists at the
hated man of the altar he must have lost
his wits to think she wouldnt use this last
means of destroying him

  none of your tricks can sweep those
two away she went on when i bring
them before the people we shall have a
confession yes a confession from you
of all the things that a greedy priestcraft
has denied them

sha-topat wanted to throw
back his head and laugh but he re-
strained himself kept his expression aloof
and severe

  i fear o teeva he said condescend-
ingly that the trick has been played on
you already by nepah those two werent
whites if you remember he never let
you see them in anything but a dim light

  not whites she screamed in outrage
well let the people decide that in the
morning

  why wait he said why not decide
now he clapped his hands three times
he went on talking smoothly you see
my dear native witchdoctors have many
tricks one of them is to prepare a solu-
tion any color desired which dries on
a person like a second coating of skin it
will last several days without beginning to
peel-unless it is scrubbed off

  he then turned and looked toward the
small door to the left of the altar through
it came two burly blacks roughly pushing
and shoving the jungle girl helene was
before them but she was a startingly dif-
ferent an almost unrecognizably different
helene from the girl teeva had seen a
few hours before

  teeva stared speechlessly at her in-
stead of a fair-skinned red-haired white
woman this captive being forced into the
temple had jet-black hair and the dusky
earth-brown skin of a high-born native
girl

  at first the empress couldnt under-
stand did sha-topat think he could
foist this wench off as the outlander the
outlander  the high priest read her
thoughts

  look more closely he said with sly
satisfaction the freak color of this
black baggages eyes is unchanged the
lines of her impudent body are the same
those features so much like a white per-
	jungle

sons are the reason she was selected by
nepah for her role

  the black guards had dragged helene
up on the altar while he talked they
kept her arms twisted behind her brutally
punishing her muttering warnings that
they would snap the bones if she dare
speak a word

  yes this is your white woman he
said so all might hear with the false
whiteness scrubbed off with nothing more
complicated than a brush and warm
water

  teevas limbs were trembling you-
you devil youve changed her

  nepah was the one who changed her
he stated coldly i show her as she really
is if you had faith in your god youd
never have been taken in by this tawdry
scheme raa made us and us alone
white o weak and foolish woman never
again can you have our trust

  teeva was like a frightened animal at
bay they were all against her all con-
demning her the man-wheres the
man she demanded hysteria edging her
voice

  with wild hope it had suddenly oc-
curred to her that the high priest would
be showing ki-gor too if he had been
able to capture him everything would be
all right if ki-gor were still safe in her
palace

  the man is white she went on why
dont you show him

  unfortunately raa did not see fit to
deliver him into my hands alive snarled
sha-topat he is dead cut to ribbons
i hardly think anyone but you would care
about having his remains gathered up in a
basket and brought in for display

his lips above the bristling black
beard twisted scornfully before he
sent me back he continued the god
said he would deliver them over to me
one dead and one alive and he did just
that and he spoke into the minds of these
two simple slaves telling them exactly
how to wash the girl clean of her false
color and deliver her here as i awakened
he turned to the two guards demanding
of them to say whether it had been as
he described

  it is true master they said speaking
the lines they had been taught we

stories

tremble yet

  never deigning to look at helene the
high priest waved his hand in dismissal
take the wench away he said she
will die with the traitor-or do you wish
the people of atlantis to believe that you
yourself were the leader in this awful
treachery

  teeva knew what he meant either she
humbled herself before the priestcraft and
denounced nepah or he would make her
the goat of the whole affair she en-
visioned his priests spreading their lies
through the city parading nepah and
helene as exhibits using her own guards
to relate how an angry raa had brought
the holy self-sacrificing high priest back
to life to save atlantis from its vicious
ruler

  it was possible that he might whip the
people into such a frenzy that they might
try to storm the palace teevas nerve
shattered she must save what she could
from the wreckage a few words spoken
and she would still be safely seated on
the throne of atlantis

  i-i see now what a fool nepah has
made of me she began her voice trem-
bling her eyes avoided the officer he
must have cast a spell on me i thought

i	could make atlantis strong and rich
again by aiding him but i realize he was
betraying us all

  she looked shrunken and old and ugly
as she deliberately lied to save her own
skin

  if he learned one witchdoctors trick
she went on he must have learned others
equally as vicious i was his main victim
she had to try twice before she could
manage the final sentence praise raa
for lifting the blindness from my eyes
in time-and-and i give humble thanks
to you sha-topat for   her voice
trailed away she couldnt finish the last
bitter words

  but she had said enough to suit the
high priest from now on everything
would be easy teeva would never again
be more than the merest figurehead a pup-
pet utterly dependent on him

  he announced that the imperial guards
would remain in the temple until dawn
praying to raa for forgiveness i will
return then to speak the gods judgment on
you he added you have committed acts
beast-gods of atlantis	

of arrogance against the sacred persons
of the priests and you must atone for
these acts

  then with the guards effectively im-
mobilized giving his own men an oppor-
tunity to search the city for ki-gor un-
hampered he had only one last matter to
settle with teeva the matter of her mar-
riage to his creature tal that could be
better worked out in private and he knew
that it would take only a few hard flat
threats to make the empress agree to ac-
cept tal immediately

  you have publicly repented teeva he
said loftily let us retire to a private
chamber and together seek to assuage
the wrath and grief of your father the
sun-god

  as he strode confidently from the altar
and started for the door the badly-shaken
girl meekly followed him nepah followed
her with hurt and angry eyes not once
did she look at him he didnt resist as
the guards led him away to a cell to
await his hour of death

viii

i-gor was two-thirds of
the distance to the ground when the
sudden clamor above him told that his
escape had been discovered without
breaking his swift descent he looked up
two warriors thiust their heads out of
the window from which he had just come
bellowed excitedly to their fellows

  almost immediately the rope gave a
violent jerk the blacks were hauling him
upward he let himself slide dangerously
fast then letting the rope burn his fingers
risking a slip which would dash him to
the courtyard

 below he heard ngeesos alarmed
curse tembu georges angry bellow
their voices told him he was losing his
race for freedom the guards were haul-
ing him upward so swiftly that even
though he would reach the end of the rope
in another second he would be too high
above the ground to let go then like a
hooked fish he would have to dangle help-
lessly to the end of the line while they
pulled him in

  but the two chieftains werent about to
let him be recaptured hold tightly
warned tembu george and then he and

the pygmy were running outward away
from the building ripping their bows free
of the thongs which fastened them to their
backs when they were far enough out in
the courtyard for the men bending from
the window to make good targets they
spun and began to feed arrows into the
opening slashing them in over the sill
with deadly accuracy

  ki-gor heard one of the bantu guards
give an agonized scream the upward
movement of the rope ceased for the
barest fraction of time though to the
white lord it seemed an endless interval
he hung motionless

  then writh sickening abruptness he was
plunging toward the ground the rope was
still gripped in his hands but he had the
sensation of falling free ngeeso and
tembu george had driven the guards
away from the window forced them to
drop the rope

 down and down he fell skimming
frighteningly close to the rock wall and
ten feet above the ground just as he felt
he was hurtling to his death the slack in
the rope gave out the tremendous strength
and skill acquired through years of tree-
travel acrobatics kept him from being
snapped off the line or battered senseless
against the wall

  he gave his numbed arms and shoulders
a moment to regain feeling then he slid
down the remaining few feet of rope
dropped lightly to the ground the chief-
tains kept lashing arrows into the window
until he reached them

  this way he said sprinting toward
a narrow archway those half-witted
guards will be glad of the excuse to switch
their chase from the raiders to us every
man in the palace will be on our trail

  they raced through the arch down a
walk and into another and larger court-
yard the indistinct grey shape of wall
rose in front of them by its height ki-
gor guessed it to be the outer palace
wall

  a hundred yards to their right they
heard running footsteps and a hoarse voice
called to them to identify themselves one
of the outer guards had been alerted by
the uproar in the palace without breaking
his stride ki-gor ran straight for the
wall reaching it he stopped ordered
ngeeso to join crossed hands with him
	jxjngle

  you first he told tembu george and
as the masai leader stepped up on their
hands they catapulted him upward with
ail their strength

with a slap of his big hands the
chieftain caught the edge of the
wall whirled himself to the top it was
a maneuver the three had executed many
times in their adventures because of the
masais great weight it took the combined
efforts of both ki-gor and ngeeso to
lift him over any high barrier

  ngeeso went second because ki-gor
could fling the pygmy upward without
assistance the white lord went last
since he alone of the three had both the
agility and flashing power to get up with-
out being boosted

  as soon as ngeeso was safe the
white lord backed off from the wall
judging the height the guard had located
them now and was pounding forward
roaring the information to other men on
watch nearby the iron-nerved ki-gor
seemed unconscious of his danger but in
truth he knew he would have time for only
one attempt and he forced himself to be
calm and make it right

  he took one two three short measured
steps then he was driving head-on at the
barrier with terrific speed as he neared it
he gave a tremendous leap and his legs
pistoning ran straight up the face of the
wall

  above him tembu george leaned for-
ward his whole body rigid with anxiety
up and up ki-gor came and then all at
once it seemed his momentum was gone
inches below the the masais outstretched
right hand the invisible grip of the earth
halted him he wavered started to skid
downward

  then for a fraction of time his toes dug
into a rough place on the stone he
plunged his arms upward and caught
tembu georges wrist just as his footing
broke from under him grunting with
strain the masai and the pygmy hauled
him over the edge

  that was too close gasped tembu
george we wont take a chance like that
again

  ki-gor sucked a great breath into his
lungs we made it didnt we he growled
come on he caught the far edge of

stories

  the wall and dropped to the ground the
two men followed him

  they were in a narrow deserted street
in the darkness a grey confusion of stone
buildings stretched away on both sides of
them they were far more confused in
this alien environment than they would
have been in a stretch of trackless un-
inhabited jungle

  by the black beard of gimshai swore
ngeeso in his despair unconsciously
speaking his thoughts aloud in this rabbit
warren how can we ever find her how
can we know where to go

  though tembu george shared the feel-
ings of the more emotional pygmy he had
kept silent waiting for the white lord to
take the lead and now watching the dim
outlines of ki-gors face a chill came
over the black giant

  we will find sha-topat the jungle
man said and his voice was abnormally
flat and toneless after that i believe
well be able to find helene

  and hearing him speak not for all the
riches in the world would either tembu
george or ngeeso have changed places
in that moment with sha-topat no longer
did they have any doubt in the final suc-
cess of their search they were three men
alone in a city of treachery and death
and henceforth every mans hand would
be against them but the two blacks knew
that somehow someway the white lord
would bring them to the high priest

as they started down the empty
street at a run ki-gors sensitive
ears picked up the first faint distant pulsa-
tions of the great trumpet in the temple
neither of the black men heard it it
didnt take him long to decide that at this
hour of the night the sound could only
mean that a religious ceremony of some
kind was in progress

  fortunately for ki-gor fear of sha-
topats raiders kept the people of atlantis
in their homes during the dark hours ex-
cept for dodging an occasional patrol of
searchers from the palace he and the two
chieftains were able to thread their way
through the rutted alleys of the city in
comparative safety and the clank of
weapons and armor always warned them
of the approach of guards

  by the time the trumpet fell silent ki-
beast-gods

of atlantis



gor had the location of the temple firmly
fixed in his mind after that no matter
how often he had to retrace his steps out
of streets with blind endings or streets
that twisted off at crazy angles an animals
sense of direction always set him right
again

  two hours after leaving the palace he
reached the immense temple of raa it
was by far the greatest building in at-
lantis and even in darkness the huge tiers
of stone pyramiding upward the massive
columns were enough to give pause to
those who thought to challenge the priest-
crafts power this building and the evil
caste it symbolized both had survived for
thousands of years

  the temple was surrounded by a broad
plaza the sound and glint of armor and
weapons told the white lord that sha-
topats personal guards stood watch
around the building though he said noth-
ing to the chieftains his heart sank the
minutes drained by while he studied and
restudied the scene his mind grappling
futilely with the problem of passing the
guards

  it was a cool night yet sweat beaded
his forehead broke out over his body he
felt a terrible soul-rending responsibility
for every wasted minute the torture of
knowing helene was in the hands of the
priests while he hid in the streets like a
frightened helpess cur was unbearable
he had to fight the crazed impulse to
fling himself at the guards his whole
body cried out with the desire to kill and
rend to seek in frantic action some re-
lease from the pressure which threatened
to burst his mind

  yet of his inner feelings tembu george
and ngeeso guessed nothing he seemed
like a rock of confidence to them a guar-
antee that all would be well they de-
spised themselves for moving nervously
fretfully when he showed no least sign
of anxiety

  then near the right comer of the build-
ing a square of light suddenly appeared
a door had opened through it flooded
robed figures-the devil-raiders scores
of them carrying torches came pouring
into the plaza breaking into squads of
five and scattering out toward the dif-
erent streets which came up to the temple

-jungle-summer

  ki-gor saw many of the squads head
for the narrow street where he was hid-
den the shallow doorway in which he
and the chieftains stood would be a death-
trap if the raiders caught them there he
didnt realize yet that these squads were
being sent out for the specific purpose of
finding and killing him

  back down the street he warned

he sped along seeking a place to
hide the block was a long one
with the houses jammed wall to wall so
that there were no alleys which offered
escape he glanced back saw how swiftly
the raiders were crossing the plaza he
couldnt let them trap him now

  his eyes searched desperately along the
building fronts stopped on one house with
a roof far lower than the others he halted
the two blacks in front of it

  our best chance is to get  the roof
he told them and lie low theyll spread
over every street around here in a few
minutes

  his hands were swiftly exploring the
house wall as he talked the mortar had
crumbled away between stone blocks leav-
ing narrow toe and finger holds he and
ngeeso boosted tembu george up to the
low roof using their crossed hands as
they had in scaling the palace wall then
he tossed ngeeso up and the masai
caught the little mans wrists and pulled
him to safety

  ki-gor himself climbed the face of the
wall like a monkey scampering up a bluff
the raiders were half-way down the block
when he pulled himself over the edge fell
flat beside the chieftain

  all three of them held their breath
wondering if they had been seen but the
robed men sprinted past without hesitat-
ing for several minutes squads of raiders
kept going by their only sound being a
swift brush of bare feet then came
groups of priests muttering among them-
selves at being sent out on such a hunt

  ki-gor caught enough snatches of their
conversation to know definitely that sha-
topat was very much alive they search
for us he told the blacks its lucky we
got this close to the temple when we did
because they naturally wont expect us to
be hiding on their own doorstep

  with the acid of impotent rage eating
	jungle

at his vitals he listened to the footsteps of
the priests dying away and despised him-
self in the quiet he lay with his face
pressed against the roof and the darkness
hid from tembu george and ngeeso the
fact that his fists were knotted his arms
rigid with the effort of hiding his true
emotions

  after a time he heard the soft quick
shuffle of bare feet in the street below he
raised up straining his eyes to distinguish
the three figures trotting from the city
they were three of sha-topats devil-
men returning from some mission apart
from the great hunt just launched

  he started at them hating them in that
moment as he had never hated anyone be-
fore and then suddenly unexpectedly
there flashed full-born in his mind a des-
perate idea

  he turned to the chieftains his voice
lashed them to their feet stop those three
with arrows he said

then he flung himself flat

twisted his legs over the edge of
the roof and finding a toe-hold climbed
downward toward the street the raiders
were nearly abreast of him as he reached
the ground at such close range they
could see his white body clearly

  they stopped dead startled for a mo-
ment one of them gave an explosive grunt
of recognition then as one man they
wheeled toward him tearing their swords
free

  there was a rapid thump thump as
though two ripe melons had been burst
apart by twin hammer blows ngeeso
and tembu george had driven their first
arrows home almost simultaneously

  the black in the center flung up on his
toes the whites of suddenly bulging eyes
gleaming like twin moons he stumbled
backwards and fell the man on his left
was spun half-around by the arrow that
took him in the chest lurched three crazy
steps down the street dropped to his knees
and crawled another two yards before
sprawling on his face

  the third raider had whirled when he
heard the arrows blast into his compan-
ions sprinted toward the temple he ran
with straining speed knowing if he could
get a short distance from the bowmen his
black robe would merge with the darkness

stories

he hadnt gotten twenty paces when their
arrows caught him tumbled him head-first
into the gutter

  when the chieftains reached the ground
ki-gor already had stripped the three
raiders of their hooded robes put these
on he ordered theyll get us into the
temple if anything will

  he gave the largest robe to tembu
george and even then had to open some
of the seams across the back and under the
arms with his knife so it would fit over
the masais barrel chest he fitted the
pygmy by the simple expedient of cutting
off the foot and a half of excess cloth
which piled up around the little mans feet
ki-gors own robe fit him reasonably
well

  he disposed of the corpses by tossing
them on top of the low-roofed house the
chieftains spears and bows followed the
bodies for it wouldnt do for them to be
armed with any weapons other than the
short swords and daggers used by the
raiders

  then the three of them in single file
with ngeeso bringing up last so the two
larger men to some degree could hide his
smaller stature from view started for the
temple they had their hoods pulled well
forward to hide their faces

  they didnt hesitate as they reached the
plaza they moved boldly out into the
open space at a dog-trot with ki-gor in
the lead along the edge of the temple
harness glittered as several edgy guards
moved out to view them

  the sight of the black robes apparently
satisfied the guards for no hail came and
after staring a moment the men drifted
back to their stations since the raiders
were tongueless ki-gor knew he wouldnt
have to give a password or undergo any
questioning but the problem that wor-
ried him most was whether there was some
particular procedure for entering- the
temple

  he had to gamble on getting in the
same door through which the men hunting
him had flooded he had its location
roughly placed in his mind as he neared
it he saw that an armored guard stood
wide-legged before the closed door

  his nerves tightened when the man
merely stared at him giving no evidence of
budging yet still the white lord kept
beast-gods of atlantis



on holding the same course and then
at the last instant as ki-gors fingers were
curled to grasp his sword the man par-
tially turned and struck the door with his
spear

as he stepped aside the door
swung open a yellow-robed priest
stood revealed in the lighted passage
now what he said his bloated face
surly with annoyance then he saw the
three robed figures waiting well get in
here you stupid dingoes he snarled
dont keep me standing here all night

 keeping his head well down ki-gor
pushed quickly past the priest tembu
george and ngeeso were close at his
heels the door banged shut

  wait cried the priest

  ki-gor turned the priest was staring
at ngeeso his little red eyes measuring
and remeasuring the pygmys slight sta-
ture there were no men that small among
the night-prowlers

 you let me see your face he com-
manded

 but it was tembu george not the
pygmy who whirled and threw back his
hood aye master he said he took
two lightning steps toward the man his
hand still poised above his head holding
the hood away from his face surely
you know me

  horror carved the priests rotten fea-
tures his mouth flew open to scream
tembu george was too swift for him
the masai brought his doubled fists crash-
ing down on the mans skull and as he
sagged forward the huge chieftain caught
him hit him another fearful blow at the
back of the neck

 with tembu george lugging the dead
priest they hurried on down the corridor
at the first stairs they encountered they
threw the body on the lower step hoping
to make it look as if the man had killed
himself in a fall

  a half dozen times they dodged out of
sight to keep from encountering priests or
guards but at last realizing they were
doing nothing more than losing themselves
deeper and deeper in the priestcrafts hive
ki-gor decided they would have to cap-
ture one of the robed men and take the
risk of making him lead them to sha-
topat

  he remembered from his encounter with
sha-topat in the palace throne room that
the red-garbed priests were the elite so
therefore one of them would better be able
to help them pass the high priests per-
sonal guards not two minutes later he
sighted a paunchy man in scarlet hurry-
ing across an intersection a hundred feet
in front of them

  well come up behind him he told
the masai and pygmy but dont hurry
we mustnt attract attention

nd so they began to stalk him
through the silent shadowed cor-
ridors drawing up behind him with pains-
taking caution but when they were almost
within striking distance he turned sud-
denly into a side passage when they
reached the turn he had disappeared

  along the left side of the passage were
three open doors signaling the chieftains
to remain in the main corridor ki-gor
crept to the first door found the room
deserted then as he neared the second
door he heard voices one of them ringing
a chord of memory

  ah its you nabu the thin over-
bearing voice was saying its about time
i saw someone with a little authority
around here by the flaming beard of
raa do you priests mean to leave me
sitting here until i perish of thirst and
weariness

  im sure you are undergoing great
hardships highness nabu answered
drily but by those two empty wine flasks
on the table i doubt that thirst is one of
them

  ki-gor glanced into the room the fat
priest he had been following was walking
toward a circular flight of stairs the
man whose voice ki-gor had recognized
was tal the narrow-chested little man
took a few steps after the priest wavering
unsteadily on his pipe-stem legs

  oh by the way my friend tal called
trying to make his tone unconcerned and
failing completely what did you do with
that-uh-that jungle girl i strolled down
to the womens prison awhile ago and she
wasnt there

  the priest paused on the second step
of the stairs half-turned to appraise tal
his round red-streaked eyes glinted evilly

  forget her he said softly she is
	jungle

beyond your reach

  ki-gors blood turned to ice

  what do you mean cried tal

  the red-robed mans thick loose lips
quivered in a smile she had the mis-
fortune to stab a priest he said when
we were staining her skin brown she
gave us a good deal of trouble we had to
punish her

  tal frowned stupidly but she looked
all right when they had her on the altar
not a mark on her

  the greasy smile spread over the priests
whole face ah he said unctuously but
we waited until after that to punish her
you see we threw her in the slave pens
those where we keep blacks captured in
the gorge and in our night raids on outland
villages we told them she was an outcast
temple priestess    one who had been
responsible for much of their suffering
but who had now incurred the displeasure
of raa

  he started up the stairs

  i wonder if well find her alive he
added when we go to get her for the
sacrifice tomorrow

ix

kf-gors mind exploded
brute berserk rage shook him he
leaped into the room and miraculously a
sword was in his hand

  in three great strides he reached tal
he struck him a single blow with the
flat of his sword hitting him across the
side of the head it was as if he were
knocking an insect from his path

  tal careened out of the way and fell
full-length he didnt move his glazed
eyes were wide open but they saw noth-
ing

  ki-gor was over halfway up the stairs
when nabu saw him the black hood had
fallen away from the white lords face
nabu looked into that face and went dead-
white he threw up his arms his flabby
mouth flying open in terror

  and then ki-gor struck he hammered
the sword into the precise center of the
priests forehead cleaving nairns whole
face and head into separate halves and
the terrifying force of the blow carried
deep into the evil mans chest

  the jungle man tore his sword free

stories

with quick strides he retraced his way to
tal he lifted the scrawny officer as
though he were weightless sped out the
door and down the corridor to rejoin the
chieftains tal was beginning to rouse
when ki-gor turned into an open room

  what happened to the priest asked
ngeeso

  i killed him snarled ki-gor ill kill
them all he jammed his blood-wet sword
back into its sheath then giving the
alarmed pygmy no chance to question him
further he brutally slapped tal to his
senses the chieftains had never seen him
mistreat a man before they watched
wide-eyed as he grasped the terrified officer
about the neck throttled him to his knees

  youll lead us to her he commanded
and if you ever hope to see another sun
youll get us to her safely

  tals legs threatened to give under him
but with fear this time not drunkenness
his first look at ki-gor had sobered him
patches of green mottled his pale face he
quivered and shook uncontrollably

  ki-gor pulled the hood over his head
again and grasping tal by the back of
his ornate sword belt shoved the cowardly
nobleman into the hall ahead of him

  tottering retching but forced onward
at a run by the iron hand gripping at his
back tal led them down a series of stair-
ways along increasingly damp and narrow
passages convinced that if they encoun-
tered trouble with guards he would be
the first to die he avoided every possible
danger point

  at last in the far depths of the temple
he reeled against a corridor wall begged
ki-gor to listen to him he pointed to a
yellow bloom of light in the section ahead
of them along the vvay they had come
there had been only a scattering of char-
coal braziers to illuminate the slimy pas-
sages

  the slave pens are there beyond the
light he panted therell be guards
many of them i cant get you by them

  ki-gors hand was at tals throat you
will he gritted or youll die where you
stand

  listen to me pleaded the nobleman
you dont understand they check every
visitor its insane to think you can get
into the slave pens let alone get out with
the girl
beast-gods

  the white lord drew his dagger slid it
point-first up the sleeve of his robe he had
only to flick his arm downward and the
blades hilt would be in his palm seeing
what he did ngeeso and tembu george
promptly followed suit

  take us to the one in command he
said flatly well do the rest

dozen guards were scattered
along the corridor beyond them was
a great barred door the tortured sounds
and the stench that drifted past that door
left no doubt that it closed off the slave
pens

  despite tals fears the heavy-eyed
guards weary and bored as their long
night shift dragged near its end hardly
glanced at the four newcomers neither
tal nor black-robed night raiders were any
novelty to them

  tal went past the first four guards
turned right into a small cell-like room a
yellow-robed priest sat behind a table his
head dropped forward on his chest snor-
ing softly after one glance at him ki-
gor took a deep breath of relief

  close the door into the corridor
tembu george said the jungle man
softly and stand beside it he had
ngeeso walk behind the priest and clap
a hand over his mouth

  the robed man jerked upright his eyes
flying open ngeeso set him back down
with a thud ki-gor flicked his hidden
dagger into his hand

  we have come for the girl he said
tal is going to call in one of your guards
tell him to take me to her say sha-
topat sent us to get her

  ki-gor gestured with his knife his
grey eyes freezing the priest

  ngeeso will stand behind you his
knife at your back he continued if
you so much as stutter hell kill you and
while im in the pens ngeeso and tembu
george will stay here to guarantee that
i get back safely

  do what they say please quavered
tal theyre worse than sha-topats
killers i know them i tell you

  in a matter of moments the great door
had swung open and the white lord was
inside a cavernous room water dripped
from the ceiling and the floor was slimy
with filth the stench which hung in the

of atlantis	

dead air was choking

  in the gloom he saw the blacks huddled
about the walls the only sound in that
vast room was the hoarse murmurous
breathing of the prisoners at first he
thought they were sleeping but as his
eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he
could see that every head was turned in
his direction like animals they crouched
there in the shadows and watched

  all right you carrion cried the guard
with ki-gor wheres the girl

there was movement in a

group of prisoners near one of the
torches someone was slowly getting up
he heard the words here i am it was
helene struggling to keep her voice from
trembling

  you go get her said the guard but
ki-gor wras already striding toward her
he felt as though a knife were being
rapidly stabbed into his brain

  then he was in front of helene hi
fear-crazed eyes searching her he let the
hood slide far enough back so that she
could see his face what have they done
to you he said brokenly my darling
my helene

  helene had seen the dark-robed figure
advancing and thought she was to be taken
to the altar for sacrifice then suddenly
the man was before her and his face wa
ki-gors

  she couldnt speak couldnt move ki-
gor was dead she had heard sha-topat
say that they had killed him

  and yet here in the stinking depths of
the temple was ki-gor speaking to her

  she is unharmed white man rasped
a bantu voice

  then sanity came back to her it was
her mate words rushed to her lips and
her hands went out toward him

  dont touch him or speak warned the
same bantu voice the guard watches

  she checked herself in time thank
you molaki she murmured  may your
gods bless you for the help youve given
me this night

  the blacks answer was a rasping whis-
per do not be misled woman i have
only hate for both you and this man i
had my men protect you because it frees
me of my debt to this white devil

  and now you are free to kill me is
	jungle

that it asked ki-gor gently remember-
ing molakis angry pledge when after his
capture the jungle man had intervened
to halt mistreatment of the prisoners and
get their wounds dressed

  thats right the black declared i
know you shouldnt be here that the
priests are hunting you the ones who
brought us from the gorge were talking
about it

  his legs had been badly cut when he
was captured he sat with his legs ex-
tended in front of him his eyes were
feverish

  i could call out to that guard now and
youd be a dead man he went on but
im going to wait until you start toward
the door or maybe until you are just step-
ping through the door he looked up at
ki-gor his lips drawn back from his
teeth then ill call out then ill have
my vengeance

  ki-gor drew the hood back around his
face very well molaki he said no
matter what you do you have my undying
gratitude

and then grasping helene roughly
by the arm the white lord led
her across the room still grumbling at
ki-gors slowness the guard moved ahead
of them toward the door helene was
tense expecting every step to hear mo-
lakis betraying cry she caught up with
the guard reached the door and still the
bantu hadnt called

  then suddenly ki-gor raised his
knotted right fist sledged the guard on
the back of the neck the man collapsed
without even a grunt the white lord
caught him before he hit the ground
hefted him over his shoulder and trotted
back to molaki saying simply wait v
to helene

  the bantu struggled to his feet a
bewildered frown on his hard features

  you didnt give us away said ki-gor

  the black shook his head i wanted
to he said but i couldnt do it i
thought how precious freedom would be to
me

  ki-gor smiled i didnt think you
would quickly now get our men up
you are going to have a chance at free-
dom urging them to silence he told
them his plan

stories

  he gave molaki the guards sword
then with the aroused prisoners massed
at his back he went to the door and
mocking the unconscious guards voice as
well as he could he hammered on the
door crying open up the wench is
giving us trouble

  the guards never knew what hit them
as the door opened ki-gor and molaki
cut down the first two men then like
water from a burst tank the prisoners
drove out of the slave pen and engulfed
the other armored men

  few of the guards even had time to
draw their swords before a maddened
screaming mass washed over clawing
them down by sheer weight of numbers
those that survived were thrown into the
slave pen and their priest leader followed
them after ki-gor had made him lead them
to the separate cell-block where nepah was
imprisoned for once in his life nepah
was neither calm nor sardonic tears of
joy ran down his face

  ki-gor kept tal with him made him
take them to one of sha-topats armories
where the newly freed prisoners obtained
swords and javelins after that they swept
like a swift dark tide through the temple
corridors capturing or killing priests and
guards as they went

  a score of guards were drawn up out-
side the chamber in which sha-topat laid
down the hard rules of his victory to
teeva the sudden appearance of ki-
gors makeshift army almost took them
unawares but they were picked men hard
and fearless and they held their ground
before the door

  when sha-topat heard their cries of
alarm he burst out of the room his eyes
almost started from his head when he saw
ki-gor and a horde of filthy wild-eyed
barbarians smashing at his guard he stag-
gered back a step his white hands claw-
ing and twisting over his robe

  no he shrieked how can this be

  he spun then darted back into the
doom slamming the door behind him
with a bellow of sheer animal rage ki-
gor struck against the line of guards the
sight of sha-topat was the lash of whip
to him

  the guards broke apart before the
blonde-manecl madman he burst through
the gap in their ranks and in one great
beast-gods of atlantis



leap had reached the door he flung it
wide just as sha-topat sped through an
arched opening in the back of the room

ki-gor drove past teeva without
seeming to see her through a nar-
row hall and down twisting stairs he
hurtled in pursuit of the long-legged high
priest sha-topat was armed a drawn
sword gleaming in his right hand but the
last desire he had in the world was to
face the raging jungle man in battle

  he reached the huge chamber raced
toward the altar screaming to the kneeling
guards to save him the shocked guards
came up in a mass but they had no chance
to reach the high priest before ki-gor

did

  as sha-topat reached the altar ki-
gor was on his heels the high priest
whirled slashed wildly at the jungle man
knowing he could run no longer his one
hope was to keep the white lord from
mounting the altar long enough for the
stunned guards to reach him

  he might as well have tried to ward off
a thunderbolt with his sword ki-gor
battered his way up the steps without even
pausing all the accumulated hate and
anger of that long and awful night had
flamed in his mind when he saw sha-
topat

  he drove the frantic high priest back
to the center of the altar he lunged
forward and slashed open the front of
sha-topats robe immediately he was
back again seeking for the opportunity to
plunge his blade to the hated mans heart
two more close strokes and the whole
upper part of the priests garment hung in
tatters

  the leather vest he wore was revealed
in the center was the metal catch where
the fake sword had been held and lower
down was the gaping cut where nepahs
sword had struck him

  ki-gors eyes narrowed when he saw
the leather vest then his mouth twisting
with contempt he leaped forward beat
sha-topats sword aside and drove the
point of his blade through the gash in
the leather

  he stabbed with such violence that he
plunged his sword up to its hilt sha-
topat shuddered horror contorting his
face he dropped his weapon and stiff-

ened ki-gor stepped away his features
pitiless

  sha-topat went down slowly his hands
scrabbling the air he kept opening and
closing his mouth like a fish out of water
but no sound came out then he slid to
his knees leaned forward and toppled on
his face one violent spasm shook him
and the high priest of raa was dead

  ki-gor came to his senses gradually
he looked about him and blinked crowded
all about the altar were teevas guards
staring strangely at the dead man they
made no move to harm ki-gor

  through the door at a run came tembu
george ngeeso helene and nepah he
understood the attitude of the guards very
soon then for nepali leaped to the altar
beside him harangued them savagely for
having let sha-topat fool them he had
ki-gor walk down among them so they
could see his skin was truly white then
he showed them in the close light of the
altar how helenes hair had been dyed and
her skin stained

  now that you are warriors again
cleansed of stupid fears he said lead us
back to the palace

but teeva had appeared as
he spoke like a pale shadow tal
hung close to her let us avoid all the
bloodshed we can she urged tal knows
the priest underground passage to the
palace let us go that way and we wont
lose any more men through battle with the
bands of priests roving the city the
priests will have to deal with me now
so we can get everything we want without
fighting

  nepah looked surprised but he agreed
her request was reasonable so trailed by
both the guards and the released prisoners
they sought out the tunnel in half an
hour they were in the throne room
of the palace teevas first move was to
send messengers calling all available war-
riors in the empire to mass for her pro-
tection then she had food and drink
brought for the prisoners ki-gor had
freed

  the white lord waited until the starved
men had eaten then he approached teeva

  you wanted two things he said to
break the hold of the priestcraft on your
subjects and to establish contact with the
	jungle

people and the plenty of the outside
world

  teeva stirred nervously her eyes seek-
ing over the chamber

  your first desire has been achieved
ki-gor went on now let us speak of the
second one my friends and i are ready to
leave atlantis and i would advise that you
send a mission with us to gather informa-
tion on   

  teeva abruptly straightened she didnt
let him finish

  i am sorry she said curtly but
neither you nor any of these prisoners are
leaving atlantis i am prepared to be gen-
erous with you you may live here as free
men she leaned forward and stared at
him but none of you can ever leave
but you said   began ki-gor

  she cut him off again i know what i
said-but i didnt mean it it was the
best reason to give you to get your help
against sha-topat

  ki-gor couldnt believe his ears what
of the lost colony you and nepah were so
anxious to regain  he asked

  there is no lost colony she said
coldly we know we are not the only
whites in the world-that is those few of
us who rule know that-but the people
are taught differently it makes them more
content with their lot

  nepah had stood silently shamefacedly
as the empress talked low-voiced now
he said but teeva these people saved
your throne for you you can repay them
this way you must let them go

  must she said never again will
there be anything i must do

  ki-gor drew a deep breath he had
taken all he intended to take from teeva
if we cant go with your approval he
stated with slow emphasis we will go
without it and we are starting now

  she smiled mockingly oh no by this
time the palace is overrun with warriors
and tal has instructed them to let no one
leave

  that traitor cried nepah you put
him in command by all the gods this
is more than enough you betrayed me
deserted me in the temple and i tried
to pardon you because you were my em
press

  he was trembling with emotion

  did i fight and slave to rid atlantis

stories

of one tyrant he demanded only to

see another and more stupid one take his
place no i thought the lot of our people
would be improved but it wont it
never will i see that now

  he whirled on ki-gor his face ashen
come i will lead you out of this ac-
cursed place he said hoarsely she cant
stop us

teeva leaped from her throne
raced screaming toward the lines of
guards along the wall attack attack
she commanded

  the guards hesitated then sluggishly
moved out from all four walls to box in
the prisoners teeva sped toward the door
crying for more guards from outside to
enter

  the prisoners suddenly alive to their
danger clustered about ki-gor and ne-
pah the officer ran toward the back of
the room

  break through these guards he cried
well reach the same tunnel by which i
brought you into atlantis

  the men surged after him ki-gor
ngeeso and tembu george formed al
shield about helene the line of guards
held for a few minutes but their heart was
not in this battle and ki-gors forces
swept them aside nepah led them through
the queens rooms and into the abandoned
armory where they had first entered the
palace they had snatched every available
torch from the walls as they ran

  he fumbled at the wall and a block of
stone eased open take helene ki-gor
told n geeso you can follow the marks
you made with your spear in the tunnel
then the white lord tembu george
and nepah stood back and helped speed
the excited prisoners into the tunnel a
clash of arms in the hall told them that
teevas forces were closing

  they pushed their way to the door as
the rear guard retreated into the room
molaki was the last man in

  get in that tunnel ordered ki-gor
youre in no condition to be fighting
molaki gave him a taut smile and stood
firm helping beat off the guards trying to
force the door until the last of his men
were in the tunnel then with ki-gor he
ducked into the opening after nepah and
tembu george theofficer pressed the
beast-gods of atlantis	

hidden lever manipulating the secret door
and it closed crushing two guards who
had tried to follow them in

  by the time the guards broke the door
open ki-gors men were far down the
tunnel they reached the lake without be-
ing molested dawn had broken ngeeso
had already sent parties out along the wall
to gather in every available boat

  within a short while the little flotilla
was on its way across the lake as they
reached the cavern the bumbling tal was
just beginning to put boats out from the
city molakis tribesmen pulled the oars
with a will following nepah through the
cavern with freedom almost in their
grasp they had no intention of being over-
hauled

  when they reached the end of the
cavern nepah led them to the opposite
side of the river from the one where the
landing was he brought the boats up to
a small opening in the wet wall after
reassuring the guards stationed on the
landing that nothing was wrong

  we havent the boats to go up the
gorge he said and anyway this passage
is far safer it will take us to the top
of the cliff and teevas men wont follow
us because i will collapse the entrance

while the others were un-
loading the officer took his boat
to the farthest end of the cavern where
the water from the gorge entered ki-gor
saw his torch moving along the wall and
wondered what he was doing but by the
time nepah returned the white lord had
forgotten about it

  ki-gor and nepah were the last ones
into the passage they climbed twenty steps
and then the officer stopped to locate a
certain stone he got ki-gor to help him
heave on it when it finally moved there
was a grinding of stones and with a sud-
den nimble the lower end of the passage
collapsed

  an hour later they reached the top of
the bluff came out into light of the morn-
ing sun the bantus had walked back to
the edge of the great crater and stood
looking down at atlantis ki-gor and the
officer joined them

  nepah stared moodily at the distant city

at long last their evil will be at an end
he said

  unfortunately ki-gor declared it
will probably go on for a long long time
yet

  nepali shook his head i broke the
locks which control the flow of water into
the lake the full weight of the river is
turned out of the gorge and into the
cavern in a hand of days water will run
in the streets of atlantis in two hands
it will be hip-deep over the whole island
and the entrance to the cavern will be
covered he clenched his fist and they
havent a chance to repair the locks

  he turned to ki-gor placed his hand
on the jungle mans shoulder i will say
goodbye

  goodbye exclaimed the white lord
why you are going with us

  no nepah said wearily im going
back one of my ancestors helped build the
second empire he dug out the river bed
in the cavern built the water lock
fashioned the whole system of defense
which made it possible for them to sur-
vive

  he dropped his hand from the white
lords shoulder

  he helped build it now i am destroy-
ing it he went on i must share their
fate

  but you blocked the passage ki-gor
told him you cant go back

  nepah looked away i didnt tell the
whole truth he said theres another
passage

  ki-gor argued with him but he wouldnt
be swayed so at last the white lord and
helene set out with the bantus as they
topped a rise which would hide nepah
from- view ki-gor turned and looked
bade

  nepah stood at the edge of the crater
as ki-gor watched the officer lifted his
arms toward the sun then he took a
step forward and was gone he had leaped
to his death in the lake

  ki-gor involuntarily raised a hand as
though to stop him he felt helenes soft
fingers on his arm he turned slowly to
rejoin the others she walked beside him
neither of them spoke until the crater
was far behind them
madmans trek

by r c walker

   to go out into the mid-african veldt during the feed
   ing time of python is a matter of two distinct depar
   tures first you must take leave of your senses   

the azure blue night

studded with gleaming stars gently
embraced the mission house which
shone white and cool on the eastern slope
of merembe hill great spreading iroko
trees framing the building seemed to reach
up their arms to taste the breeze and shake
off the heat of the african day

  weary from the long safari from
nairobi the two younger priests were al-
ready fast asleep as father francis dill
could tell by their sonorous breathing he
too was tired from a busy day helping his
native boy prepare rooms and a fine dinner
to celebrate the arrival of the new mission-
aries from great britain

  but father dills mind attuned to the
stirring of living things at night would
not rest he contemplated how strangely
different african days and nights were
from days and nights in other parts of the
world here in the heart of uganda days
were hot and all living things seemed to
sleep while in the darkness of african
nights there was no peace

  he became conscious of drums far
away and drifting stjl farther away to-
wards the northeast- the insistent pulsa-
tions were spelling out a message possibly
a birth or a death was being relayed to
relatives in outlying villages

  he hoped the message would not upset
his plans to spend a quiet day with his new
friends who were to take his place while
he returned to england on leave he had
run the mission alone for many years but
as the number of converts to christianity
had increased the need for help had arisen
not only did he administer to the souls
of the lakuria tribal people but also to
their minor illnesses and grievances

  the tranquil sleep that finally over-



took him was abruptly shattered by a
voice frantically calling father father
it is i mbogo please father come

father dill swung his long legs
over the side of the high bed and
parted the mosquito netting in the light of
early dawn he saw his native boy slender
and built like a whippet nervously clasp-
ing and unclasping his hands perspiration
ran in rivulets down his shiny black body
he knew mbogo never would disturb his
sleep unless a matter of great urgency had
arisen he wondered if the beating of the
drums had a bearing on mbogos agitation

  what is it mbogo why have you
come back he asked in a crisp but kind
voice

  the black boy clucked his tongue against
the roof of his mouth my sister maena
she got boy baby and girl baby last night
my grandmother she on way from nyaba-
hiki to kill boy baby maena she chris-
tian now she want both babies

  father dill sprang from the bed and
hastily started dressing mbogo he
ordered sharply you stay here and take
care of the new fathers i will go to your
sister at once

  the barbaric custom of killing one twin
was the one tradition father dill had
hoped he never would have to contend
with though he had taught the christian
ways of right and wrong and thou shalt
not kill the old natives stubbornly clung
to their primeval customs for generations
the natives had believed evil spirits doomed
the family that bore twins and that by
sacrificing the life of one of the babies
the demons would be driven out since the
tribal people of africa put more value on
   at the same moment the snake saw himt


	jungle

the life of females the boy baby would

die

  a feeling o gratitude filled father dills
heart he was getting some place with the
younger natives they wanted to follow
christian principles and evidentally shared
his fear that the grandmother should she
arrive at the kraal first could incite the
older natives to such a frenzy that their
savage and primitive impulses would tri-
umph over moral and ethical codes he
must get to the kraal before the old
woman could start her evil work the
young natives needed him for they had
sent for him

  mbogo when do you think your grand-
mother will reach your village

  five hours from now father if you
go down the north slope you will get there
in two hours mbogo said hopefully his
appraising glance of his masters well
rounded figure expressed doubts as to the
speed the missionary could muster

  mbogo your young legs can carry you
faster than my middle-aged ones and you
can climb and jump no boy i will take
the grass route on the eastern side of the
hill my bicycle will get me there in three
hours

  the lakuria boys face showed alarm
his tongue clucked in his mouth again
father he pleaded take gun and knife
pythons roaming grassland they have left
the plantations they want big food
nonsense mbogo a python wont at-
tack me how could it eat me why it
cant even get my head into its mouth
during his many years as a missionary
in central africa father dill had had
only one encounter with a wild animal a
cheetah once had scratched his cheek
but father dill was adroit with a knife
the skin of that spotted cat now hung on
the wall in his sisters house in sussex

  he knew february was the time the
big reptiles would be searching for food
to carry them through the cooler weather
of the oncoming winter season but a little
black babys life was in jeopardy and he
would not fail these simple people who
put so much faith in him

as he pedaled along the native
track through the tall yellow grass he
was deeply concerned at what might hap-
pen if he did not reach the village in time

stories

to save maenas child a man of great
faith still he pondered and weighed every
angle of such a possibility

  he was aware that the british civil
authorities upon learning of the sacrifice
-and they surely would find out soon
enough-would swoop down on the village
and yank the old grandmother off to jail
charged with murder there was a wide
chasm between native customs and british
law example and personality were all very
well but father dill knew from experi-
ence that cold reasoning cannot suddenly
replace the exciting dissipation of magic
and ritual

  the cruel sun already high in the sky
beat mercilessly down father dills white
suit fresh and neat when mbogo took
it from the closet was now damp and
misshapen and hung in untidy folds
around his large body his face took on
a ruddy glow from the bright red lining
of the large pith helmet he stopped be-
neath an iroko tree for a brief rest the
native tracks wound sometimes out of the
way but they took advantage of every
tree that had sprung up and defied the
scorching sun to live

  he drank the tasteless boiled water from
his flask he tucked his sodden handker-
chief in his pocket and reassuringly patted
the hunting knife he carried in a leather
case hung from his light-weight wool belt
a few miles ahead another tree would
give respite from the tropic heat

  he knew the grandmothers trek from
nyabahiki would be slower riding in a
machilla she would make no stops for
her carriers were accustomed to hot sun-
light and those toting the machilla would
exchange places with the ones who were
walking close by the carriole

  no breeze stirred the grass no birds
were flying the sun had complete mon
opoly of the broad valley uncomfortable
as he was father dill dared not relax his
pace

  less than a quarter of a mile from the
next iroko tree the missionary brought his
bicycle to a screeching halt to escape bump-
ing into a great yellow form stretched
across the track his heart froze he
wished hed heeded mbogos warning and
brought his gun he dropped his bicycle
and drew his knife and waited for the
serpent to strike but it didnt   
madmans trek

  noticing the distended body he cau-
tiously looked for the snakes head and
when he saw hooves of a buck protruding
from the outstretched mouth he breathed
easier he knew the python could not harm
him the snake would stay there for two
months until the buck was digested re-
placing his knife in the shield he carefully
lifted his bicycle across the snakes fat
belly

  as he walked toward the tree an un-
easiness stirred in him he knew there
must be another snake not too far from
its mate he looked nervously over the
meadow but nothing moved he was more
than half-way to the lakuria village he
would not turn back

  just as he reached the outer branches of
the spreading tree he saw the yellow body
stretched lazily along a branch high up
in the tree at the same moment the snake
saw him

  simultaneously as the python made a
flying leap towards its prey father dill
tossed his bicycle into the snakes path
and threw himself down on the hard dry
ground flat on his back he pressed him-
self against the earth keeping his legs
arms and head rigid and closed his eyes
in silent prayer

the python hit the ground reared
up and struck savagely at the mis-
sionarys cheek sinking its long power-
ful teeth into his skin it took all of his
courage to beat back the impulse to clap
his hand over the wound on his face but
he knew that if the snake could get its
head under any part of his body it would
wind coil after coil around him and slowly
tighten them until all his bones were
broken

  the reptile tried to get its tail under
his legs then under his arms it pushed
its head against father dills neck but
in spite of the excrutiating pain from the
bite he kept himself taut he was drenched
with perspiration and nearly suffocated
by the great body jabbing and crawling
around him

  the thrusts were getting less insistent
father dill took a deep breath and slowly
opened his eyes the snake was down by
his feet its fifteen feet of body stretched
back slowly it moved forward tried to
put its mouth over father dills large foot



withdrew and slithered up to his left hand
it toyed with his fingers then suddenly
gripped his hand with its teeth and began
sucking the hand into its mouth

  the pain of the alternate gripping of
the teeth into his skin and the pressure of
the pulling of his hand farther and farther
down the reptiles throat was almost un-
bearable but father dill dared not move
for an intermidable length of time he lay
there not daring to cry out lest the python
disgorge and attack him again

  father dill was a patient man up to a
point but he was not one to wait forever
for something to happen you could go
so far then he became insistent he never
had lost a battle with an element aft animal
or a person his slow sure-fire will power
always emerged triumphant now that the
initial fright of the attack had died down
he was annoyed at the delay he must get
to the kraal in time to save maenas child

  when his arm had disappeared up to
his elbow with cat-like stealth he drew
his knife from the case at his waist and
watching the snake carefully drew his
right arm slowly across his body he
buried the blade in the snakes body below
its throat and slit upward to the jaw he
then withdrew his arm and not bothering
to watch the reptile in its death throes
staggered to his feet and drunkenly made
his way to the trunk of the tree he sank
down utterly exhausted

  four hours had passed since he left the
mission house the boisterous sun was
sinking darkness soon would come

  father dill picked up his bicycle he
was shaky and tired and he had to start
slowly in order to balance with the use of
only one arm as he regained his com-
posure and the heat of the day vanished
with the setting sun he strained every
muscle to the utmost

the native village was visible
before he reached it he could see
flaming torches held aloft the rythmical
beating of the drums had an ominous
sound it was not the regulated code he
had heard the night before but the passion-
ate bombilation of celebration he knew
then that the grandmother had arrived
music and fire were powerful symbols of
the natives their souls soon would be
caught in a current no one could stop
	jungle

  father dill rode furiously to the edge
of the village he clanged the bell on his
bicycle and pushed through the excited
mob as the lakuria men caught sight of
him they gaped and quickly drew aside

  he stopped in front of maenas hut
a few yards away a wizened old lady
was seated cross-legged on the machilla
clapping her bony hands and shouting di-
rections slowly inciting the men to a
frenzy this was the big moment of her
life her vested right and she was making
the most of it

  as the eyes of the black woman- and
the missionary met a quiver of excitement
rippled through the crowd activity ceased
and a hush fell the violent beating of
the drums stopped

  father dill was aware from the look on
the black faces surrounding him that his
grotesque appearance had struck fear into
their souls he seized the opportunity and
before the old woman could ask of ka-
rema maenas husband he answered the
question in her eyes

  speaking in the beautiful luganda
language he said i am the father from
merembe hill i have come to christen
maenas babies

  the watchful eyes of the natives shifted
uneasily from father dills inspired face
to the dead-pan visage of the old woman

  painfully he stretched out his arms
see my arm and my face torn by a
great python

  he saw her shudder and recoil he
raised his voice

  but the good lord spared me and
brought me safely to maenas house

  the black men pressed closer to him
the old womans eyes like black pits
darted from one face to another she
started to speak but father dill quickly
called to karema fetch me a large bowl
of water tell maena to bring the babies
to me

  karema called to maena as he shot past
the hut the frightened girl slowly
emerged from her home clutching the
new born babies close to her breast the
despair on her face tore at father dills
heart her eyes clung to his

  give me the girl baby he said and
in an undertone whispered into maenas
ear have faith dont be afraid do

stories

you mind if i name the babies she shook
her head in the negative

  he dipped his hand into the bowl of
water karema held before him and
sprinkled it on the baby girls face lifting
up his voice he said i christen this baby
verbena in the name of the father and
of the son and of the holy ghost

he pushed tlie sleeping baby back
into maenas arm and took the other
one holding it firmly in the crook of his
right elbow he rippled the water with
the fingers of his mutilated hand the
water took on a red tinge from the blood
of his wounds he- raised his hand high
and looking directly into the eyes of the
shriveled up old woman who was fidgeting
cried out i christen this child suna in
the name of the father and of the son
and of the holy ghost the light from
the fires flickered through the water and
blood dripping from his hand adding to
the weird spectacle he made

  the boy baby squalled lustily clutching
it close to his breast father dill raised
his head and began singing in a fine bari-
tone voice onward christian soldiers
the drummers slowly took up the rhythm
and soon the place swelled with the chant-
ing of the lakuria men

  the old woman settled back she sent
a fleeting glance of hatred to the bizarre
figure before her she knew she had lost
the upper hand but she was shrewd
enough to know she must save face
amongst her own people

  she held up her arms silencing the
singers father she crackled you came
all the way from merembe hill and you
nearly lost your life you did that for a
black baby

  madam father dill replied color
of skin makes no difference to the chris-
tian we love all mankind we belong to
god just as these two babies now befong
to him

  the old woman folded her bony hands
in her lap she said the ways of the
christian are good you can keep boy
baby

  she shouted an order to her carriers and
amidst chanting and beating of the drums
her machilla was raised aloft and she dis-
appeared into the african night
the red trail

to
zanzibar

         by john starr

banter and kunted-back to back they faced that
howling mob of blood-thirsting head-hunters yet
even in the dark shadow of savage death each swore
that nothing would cheat him of his long-awaited

vengeance

a swirl of blue-gray smoke curled
lazily from the blackened muzzle of
bruce kermans revolver feet
braced shoulders thrust back in a swagger-
ing devil-daunted gesture of bravado
kerman stood in the middle of the jungle
trail

  a hundred feet distant with naked
spear still gripped in rigid fingers a black
savage clothed only in ragged loin cloth
lay sprawled in the dank mud of the trail
where he had lurched to the ground but a
moment before with a bullet through his
chest

  with a shrug of his squared shoulders
bruce advanced slowly toward the figure
and bent over his victim the set features
were twisted in a snarl of hate-the same
snarl that had curled over the blacks
mouth as he had swung that long spear
back over his naked shoulder with its
barbed point on a direct line with ker-
mans chest

  but the white mans hand had been
quicker and a streamer of livid flame had
spewed from the black muzzle of his gun

with a screech the savage had hurtled for-
ward arms outflung over his head and
crashed headlong to the floor of the
jungle

  this was kilagei king of the tribe a
burning hatred half subdued had long
seared his savage breast and now it was
satisfied kerman smiled grimly satisfied
and there would be more to satisfy before
the deal was through it meant death
in no uncertain terms in an hour now
or possibly two the whole maddened mob
would be at his throat thirsting for ven-
geance then it would be one man-one
fighting yankee adventurer who didnt
care a damn for death or the devil-
against half a thousand shrieking blood-
mad jungle devils

  kerman stared silently down at the still
form which was to decide his fate fate
for the last three years he had dodged it
pounding his way from zanzibar to the
outposts of hell and back devil-damned
kerman the traders called him

  bruce glanced at the smoke-stained re-
volver which still twirled on his trigger


	jungle

finger a man doesnt- seek the hell of
loneliness for nothing and certainly not
for the love of it usually another force
drives him to it a letter maybe with a
curt warning from a friend back in the
states-a warning which might be worded
something like this

  corony is unrelenting swears he will
follow you to the ends of civilization
you cant tell him bruce-its impossible
clear out fast old man go somewhere
where hell never follow

  yes there was that and now there was
this lifeless black form sprawled in the
trail and soon unless some mighty un-
usual occurence chanced to prevent the in-
evitable consequence there would be a
howling clawing mob of black devils look-
ing for blood and then the last four years
of purgatory that letter had been dated
four years back would come to a fitting
end

  with a careless shrug kerman turned
on his heel and strode back along the
trail in an hour it would be dark and the
dark hides many secrets with a little
luck the silent thing back there in the
mud of the jungle floor would not be dis-
covered before then it would be a re-
prieve until morning then-and at least he
could take it with the sun on his throat

night comes suddenly in the fastness
of the jungle an hour after ker-
man had moved through the deep grass of
the clearing and pushed open the door of
his cabin a solid wall of blackness and
silence broken only by the roar of dis-
tant carnivora had fallen over the trail

  the door of the hut hung listlessly
open a wavering glow of light ventured
into the outer darkness to be snatched in
a curtain of intense black above a scat-
tered maze of stars burned over the silent
clearing and the wind sobbed through
swaying upper branches of invisible trees

  in the shadow of the smoking lamp
bruce leaned over the table a row of
playing cards stretched across the board
before him and in the center under the
lamp lay a withered stack of them loosely
piled together his hand reached out me-
chanically to the middle of the table and

stories

slid the top card from the pack half-
heartedly he drew it back turned it to the
light and threw it down again

 the room was dark only a yellow
glare wavering and uncertain hung over
the table beyond the shadows crept into
a murky impenetrable blanket of gloom

  hunched over the table bruce did not
see the door of the hut swing wide he
did not turn when a disheveled rigid
figure stood framed in the opening

 well-

  it was an ironical voice almost a drawl
yet vibrant with suppressed emotion even
before the deepness of it had ceased to fill
the room bruce whirled about in his chair
a dull motionless revolver brought him to
a halt

 you corony-

  the stranger stepped deliberately over
the sill and pulled the door shut behind
him with a free hand in the glow of the
lamp his eyes gleamed dully and his mouth
twisted into a snarl of hate but for all
that it was a young face which towered
above those wide square shoulders-a face
in which youth and the tortures of african
desolation had been battling mightily for
predominance and slowly though the
youth was still there in the eyes and
mouth the hard bitter lines of desolation
were twisting that handsome face into a
perpetual snarl

  he stood with his back to the door
facing bruce the barrel of his gun which
he held low at the hip did not waver

  surprised to see me arent you ker-
man 

  the tone was almost a whisper so
tensely were the words spoken in answer
kermans hand swept the cards mechan-
ically into a loose pile on the top of the
table before him

  its four years corony

  for a moment the younger man did not
reply his eyes were half closed his
mouth twitched then suddenly he stepped
forward and stood over the other one
hand gripped the edge of the table fiercely
so that the knuckles gleamed white under
the lamplight

  sit there bruce just sit there while
i tell you something its four years now
four of the damnedest rottenest years ive
been through there was a girl back there
who had already said yes the best girl in
the red trail to zanzibar



the world bruce-had already said yes i
had to give her up to come after you damn
you i was captain corony then with a
life of happiness before me waiting for me
to step into it until you-you-
coronys voice broke with emotion
four years of torture following you
through these murderous jungles its a
wonder kerman i didnt go under before
i found you

  bruce stared quietly into the wild eyes
relaxed and yet rigid in relaxation he
leaned back in his chair a sweep of his
hand would have knocked the revolver
spinning from coronys fingers-if that
deadly muzzle did not spit fire first for a
moment kerman made no move other than
to shrug his shoulders his face in the
livid yellow glare of the oil flame was
tense above him silhouetted against the
light the menacing figure of corony hung
like a grotesque spider

  corony- the words came with an
effort-would you believe me if i told
you man to man that i am not the one
you are after 

  are you telling me that

  i am returned bruce deliberately
then- corony backed slowly away
from the table away from the light until
he stood once again in the uncertain dark-
ness with his back to the door-my an-
swer is no

  bruce nodded quietly he folded his
arms across his chest

  i expected that he said when a
man has lost four years of his life and
substituted four years of african hell he
wants compensation anything will do
coronys gun came slowly to a level with
the others head wavered a moment and
became steady

  you are right kerman i would kill
you anyway to make up for losing-her
the slow smile still hung on bruces lips
as he waited his eyes rested on the finger
that crooked around the trigger-the finger
that would in a moment send a bullet
through his brain then suddenly ignor-
ing the danger he sprang to his feet one
hand upraised

  listen

  outside like a faint wailing echo rose a
note of shrill intensity searing over the
jungle silence in a final wild eerie screech

-jungle-summer

for an endless moment it burst over the
stillness and then slowly faded into a
gurgling whimper and died

  a staccato exclamation broke from cor-
onys lips as he lurched away from the
barrier a splintering crash answered him
flying stabs of wood burst from the solid
timbers as a metal spear-head plunged
through the heavy structure half a foot
from where he had been standing

  quick bruce strode forward delib-
erately unconscious of the weapon in his
companions hand the natives are up
therell be all hell and the limit to pay
now

  his flying foot set the door clattering
shut and in a single motion he dropped the
heavy wooden bar into place then wheel-
ing about he faced his adversary

  forget it corony he said curtly its
whites against natives now and youre in
for one bloody mess of a battle i know
-ive been through it before

  for a fleeting second the two men faced
each other suddenly bruce stretched forth
his hand coronys mouth straightened
into a thin line of bitterness the snarl
of hate still clenched his mouth as he
ignored kermans outheld hand and
stepped to the window

the aperture was a crude one built
into the meshed walls of the hut it
was small and covered with a heavy net-
ting to hold out the many poisonous insects
which infested the region now coronys
fist plunged through it leaving a jagged
gash large enough to give a view of the
jungle outside a black wall of unbroken
darkness lay before him rising dense and
solid against a midnight sky

  outside now the shrill wailing had
ceased a heavy sinister stillness held that
black void in its grip a stillness that gave
way only to the whispering movements of
swaying trees then corony lurched back
from the window with an oath as a single
padded footbeat resounded through the si-
lence and a huge black shadow rose in the
opening

  coronys arm spun up a jagged flash
of fire spat from the mouth of his revolver
framed in the window the black shadow
with one arm flung wildly over its head
hurtled backward and crashed to the
os	jungle

ground

  one said corony softly

  and then another figure crouched be-
side him it was bruce dragging a gaunt
gray metallic thing that gleamed strangely
in the uncertain light corony stared at it
in amazement-at the long narrow barrel
and the solid mounting-at the strips of
ribbon-like stuff that lay beside it

  a spitter

  bruce nodded without looking up from
his task

  i use it he answered jerkily as his
fingers strained with the mechanism for
hunting-mostly but sometimes its good
in a case like this give me a hand here
the thing wont spin

  corony hesitated once again that shrill
cry rose over the clearing penetrating to
every crevice of the lonely room

  suddenly corony strode from his place
at the window and leaned over his com-
panion his outstretched hand held the
revolver

  here take this watch the window
kerman ill get this thing going

  without a word bruce rose and went to
the opening with coronys gun gripped
tightly in his hand in the outer darkness
now shadows were moving about-many
of them once a great spear buried itself
in the wall of the hut and clattered back
once too the little black automatic in ker-
mans hand flashed up and barked an an-
swer dragging a shrill scream from the
silence

  for a long time motionless bruce stood
at his post occasionally he raised his
arm and fired when the streak of flame
burst with living intensity through the
night but for the most part he merely
stared intently into the wall of blackness
and followed the movements of the sinis-
ter half-visible shadows

  were surrounded corony he said
quietly the machine gun is the last re-
sort and even that may prove to be a
dud those devils are afraid of nothing

  corony laughed have you ever seen
a man kerman who would walk into a
living chain of lead and like it

  kermans reply was to lift his hand and
fire into the darkness a swirl of smoke
curled from his revolver

  four he said softly can you fix
that thing

stories

  on the floor beside the gun corony
worked feverishly the shadow of his
contorted body spread like a great tar-
antula over the floor hunched into a knot
he answered without raising his head

  i dont know wait-

  bruce made no reply he turned his
head at that moment to look out again
through the torn window covering and
suddenly with a cry of warning jerked
backward into the safety of the room

  theyre up under here quick cor-
ony out of the open

  the others answer came in a bitter
snarl

  let em come get over by the door
man before it goes down

  a slow smile twisted over bruces
mouth as he followed the others command
no wonder this man had followed him for
four years through an african hell no
wonder he had given up life for vengeance
there was courage here-guts that
careless dont-care-a-damn attitude was
not surface bravado it was the real thing

outside the shriek of clawing devils
had risen to a wild racket no skulk-
ing now-no lurking in the protection of
the shadow they were in the open the
whole maddened yelling mob of them
clawing fingers raked at the door some-
thing heavy hurtled against the barrier

  can you fix it bruce jerked his head
around to fire the question at his com-
panion

  i-dont--know-

  coronys teeth were clenched his
fingers wound about a bar of metal
strained stubbornly to bend it back into
shape and the words when he spoke
came almost in a sob between his lips

  impulsively bruce stepped away from
the door with a grim laugh he dropped
coronys revolver on the table where the
yellow light reflected its dull barrel and
then in a stride he reached the corner of
the room when he appeared onoe more
in the circle of light a long heavy ax lay
in his hands

now he said evenly let em come
almost in answer to his words a mighty
impact shook the door with a splintering
crash of timber it burst inward and the
bead of a huge battering ram flung into
the red trail to zanzibar



the room the protecting bar fell from the
door-slot cracked into splinters with a
heavy clatter the door swung wide

  for a second a black shape hesitated on
the threshold the big ax in bruces hand
swung back over his shoulder-and de-
scended the towering black form gur-
gled once lurched forward  uncertain
legs and crashed mightily to the floor
quickly bruce thrust the body across the
entrance

  they came now in a rush of struggling
black shapes milling and thrashing in the
ebony darkness only as they came across
the sill were they visible for here the
feeble light from the room glowed in a
strangely luminous glare on the glistening
bodies and all the while the empty dead
face of the thing on the floor glared up
into bruces heaving features

  the sweat coursed unheeded down the
big mans shoulders the huge battle ax
became a dead weight leaden and with a
snarl bruce swung it round and gripped
it by the head wielding the wooden shaft
with deadly force on the lunging forms
that strained to pass him

 hurry-cor-ony-hurry

  corony jerked an answer from between
his teeth he was creeping forward now
over the floor dragging the heavy machine
gun after him in a moment he was under
the older mans feet swinging the deadly
muzzle around

 open-your legs wide bruce and
hold em that way-

  for a fraction of a second bruce let
his eyes drop from the entrance and in
that flash of time a mighty black figure
filled the opening a great spear arm went
back the light flashed on a hurtling shaft
of rigid steel

  bruces arm went up too late the metal
shaft burned savagely into his flesh and
with both hands clawing wildly at the
grim spear that seared through his shoul-
der he stumbled backward over his com-
panion with a groan of pain

  the long gray barrel swung into a rigid
position framed in the entrance was the
target the immense form of a snarling na-
tive corony dropped his head and jerked
roughly on the trigger lever the gun
broke into a murderous spitting sheet of
flame the savage with the snarl of
triumph still on his lips raised one arm

weakly to his chest and crumpled to the
floor

  the sharp staccato of gun shots rattled
over the clearing a livid sheet of fire
scorched the darkness throwing into blaz-
ing detail the writhing shadows that lunged
away from it with cries of terror corony
staring with half-closed eyes down the
black barrel swung the muzzle deliberately
in a semi-circle relentlessly back and
forth as the spitting flame cut into the
dark and at last there was silence and
corony knew the attackers were gone

 corony-

  weakly barely audible after the din of
the recoiling machine gun the name came
to him

 coronv-

  what is it bruce

  this thing-for hells sake pull it out

  grim-faced corony rose to his feet and
crossed the floor in the chair by the table
where he had stumbled in the agony of his
wound bruce sagged forward his head
hanging on his chest in a last effort to
remain upright he strained backward and
looked up at his companion corony bent
over him firmly as his eyes found those
of the victim he grasped the protruding
spear

  it will hurt he warned without emo-
tion

  pull it-out

  corony pressed one hand firmly against
his companions shoulder the other slow-
ly evenly pulled against the tortuous
shaft bruces teeth clenched together as
a half audible whimpered moan broke
through his lips finally with the bloody
weapon in his hand corony stood up

  methodically he tore a long strip of cloth
from his tattered shirt and wound it about
the wound then with the lamplight glow-
ing queerly on his face he stepped back
deliberately abruptly he went to the door
and closed it and as he turned slowly with
his back to the wall his eyes were once
again bitter and the snarl hung on his
mouth

  kerman the intermission is over

bruce raised his head wearily in
spite of the pain a smile found its
way to his face

  you still wont believe me corony
when i say im not the man
	jungle

  no

  the older man shrugged his shoulders

  then-the intermission is over

  motionless rigid corony faced him
when he spoke at last the words were
almost a whisper so tensely did they break
through the silence

  i owe you my life bruce he said
evenly im willing to listen but first
you listen to me there were just two of
you in the room with jerry that night
before we found him the other man was
jerrys best friend are you telling me
that harrington-the other man-is the
man i want-and not you

  bruce met coronys accusing gaze

  harrington-is the man he replied

  you lie

  with an effort bruce thrust his hand
into the folds of his shirt for an eternity
his numbed fingers struggled to clutch the
bit of paper that he was attempting to hold
up in the end he fell back in the chain
the scrap of paper fluttered to the table

  corony picked it up and held it under
the flickering glow of the lamp it was
written in a ragged scrawl on a tiny visit-
ing card-a short hurriedly composed
message

  harrington did it drunk dont tell
corony

  and it was signed with a single sprawl-
ing word jerry

  corony stared blankly at the damning
bit of paper slowly he shook his head

  how did you get this the words
came in a voice that trembled

  when i came jerry was dead-the
way you found him harrington was gone
this note was on the table under jerrys
hand

  coronys fingers tore through the little
white card fluttering the shreds of paper
dropped to the table

  four years-four years of hell my
girl gone my life gone bruce youve

stories

got to pay for it you knew who mur-
dered my brother damn you you could
have told me

  bruce shook his head slowly

  not against jerrys wishes he said
i loved him almost as much as you did
corony stopped short in his reply the
wild light faded in his eyes his hand
closed over the deck of cards and in a
single motion he swept them up quietly
he dropped the pack in front of his com-
panion and in the same motion reached
for the gleaming revolver that bruce had
tossed on the table without a word he
placed the gun beside the cards

  cut he said evenly high man
wins bruce raised his head with an
effort slowly deliberately he reached
forward and took the first card it gleamed
a dead black in the circle of light when he
turned it over-the ace of spades

  corony shrugged indifferently a bare
suggestion of a smile crossed his mouth
as he leaned back on the table and folded
his arms

  four years of hell thank god its
over bruce

  the older mans hand closed over the
revolver

  corony is harrington still alive
  coronys eyes opened in surprise
  harrington no

  is the girl married yet

  coronys mouth twitched a mist fell
over his eyes as he stared into the grim
muzzle of bruces gun

  no- he answered with an effort
slowly with a visible struggle bruce
rose from the table with painful steps he
went to the door and opened it for a
moment he stood framed in the entrance
staring silently out into the night then
he turned quietly deliberately he tossed
the revolver on the table

  corony boy he said softly were
going home
matto grosso fury

by gordon maccreagh

   lovely golden-skinned jane la-vieja ororke was lield jun-
   gle captive her last desperate hope for life and honor in the
   trembling hands of one man    carey the coward

david careys cultured

friends back home wouldnt have
known him here in the yungas foot-
hill country of the not so cultured side of the
andes for back home when those friends
disagreed about unimportant subjects such
as their infidelities or their religions or
about important ones such as their aesthet-
ic values they would say

  one does not settle anything by vio-
lence lets talk this tiling over like civil-
ized people

  they talked then with well controlled
emotions about this and that and every-
thing and the most aesthetic group of
them about flowers of this group the
quite choicest talked beautiful words such
as brasso-laelio-cattleya doris by alba
which did not mean that they were any
stranger than millions of other americans
who believe in civilization it meant only
that they grew orchids

  david carey was one of them he be-
lieved in capital c civilization along with
the rest of them he was different only in
that he went into those unwholesome places
where orchids grew to collect them if
the friends could have seen him just now
at the jungle fringe of this rancho de
vainilla a vanilla orchid plantation they
would have held their breaths and raised
incredulous eyebrows

  david was for one thing not dressed
like an aesthetic club man he wore de-
spite the heat heavy cord pants stuffed
into high pampas boots-against snakes-
and a frayed canvas shirt and a topi hat
with a little mosquito net draped round
it-just now tucked over the brim for

better vision he was armed with a rifle
and a machete and he was advancing
slowly upon a jaguar that snarled its big
yellow teeth over a colt that still kicked in
short bursts of terror with its each move
the jaguar spread claws as wide as dinner
plates over some new portion of it to hold
it down just as a vastly magnified cat
might do with a rabbit only davids
threatening advance kept it from sinking
its teeth into the colts throat

  behind him horses snorted and stamped
in the white staring hysteria of their
kind so that their riders were hard put
to hold them from bolting the girl on one
of them stared almost as big-eyed her
teeth bitten over her lower lip as she
murmured tensely

  be careful there por dios senor
david he may charge

  david flashed a tight grin over his shoul-
der for just a fraction of a second my
bet is he wont he said too well fed
this one not hungry enough

  and there was exactly the reason why
david was doing this foolhardy thing he
was pitting his nerve and his experience
everything he knew about animals against
the jaguars courage to hold what it had
he was to put it frankly showing off

  the girl swung round on her compan-
ion

  do something ramon dont just sit
there and look

  ramon the rancho foreman sat his
horse more calmly he lifted his left arm
in a white sling towards the girl to remind
her of it

  cha he grunted how am i to shoot


	matto grosso fury

one-hancled and he directly in the way -
and the beast is as he says well fed it
may break first

  meanwhile david was remorselessly ad-
vancing bent forward picking up his feet
feeling out the next step his eyes narrow
on the great orbs that blazed yellow under
flattened ears

  fifteen feet ten-within reach of the
beasts spring now nine-eight-se-e-
ven-

  diablos ramon credited david he
is mucho hombre plenty tough that one-
and look he wins

the jaguar spat its last snarl ex-
ploded its furious coughing growl
made a superb turning leap like a diver
in mid air and faded into the undergrowth
behind it that splashed back torn leaves
and twigs

  ole ramon shouted as men do for a
good stunt in a bull fight

  david ran to the colt helped it to
struggle to its feet

  dont  ramon shouted and spurred
his horse forward car-r-ramba hombre
dont ever drop your machete or gun it
could come back

  nali david grinned at him never
heard of one doing that once it quit
the girl spurred up leaned angrily from
the saddle what silly thing were you
trying to do its easy enough to get a
cat on your neck without begging for it
david wiped a smear of blood from his
hand the colt doesnt seem to have any-
thing broken just clawed up some wed
better herd it back with us though sure
to be more than one cat around   

  the girl wouldnt be stopped and
every one of them as dangerous as a bull
why didnt you shoot it

  dave smiled sourly for sport with a
high-power rifle at cant-miss range
might as well hunt chipmunks your
indios wouldnt eat it anyhow and i like
cats

  i think the girl said that you are
as mad as all other north americans
very likely dave grinned

  ramon picked up davids rifle and ma-
chete in spite of which amigo he
added dont ever drop your weapons
not in this country

they rode back through tangled
acres of the pale blue little vanilla
orchids all straggling over tumble-down
trellises of tall poles their long brown
beans hanging in disorderly clusters david
rode ahead slashing a way with his ma-
chete through encroaching thorny liana
vines

  behind him ramon looked at the girl
and nodded then pointed ahead with his
chin

  just such a tough man he said as is
needed on this rancho since the good lord
took the padron your father away from
it

  the sun-tan of the girls face flushed
up to a golden brown you talk as fool-
ishly as he does she said shortly be-
sides he has been here only a few days
we know nothing of him

  ramon shrugged it would seem how-
ever enough there are girls back in the
cities who would look no further than
that yellow hair of his or those who
wanted romance no farther than those al-
most too sensitive lips

  i think ramon the girl said that
you are drooling

  the rancho hacienda was showing its
pink-washed adobe walls and jail-grilled
windows between flaming poinciana trees
that shaded the vanilla ramon shrilled an
eagle whistle through his teeth

  that means the girl explained to
dave there will be coffee in the patio
senor in just ten minutes

  in the patio dave relaxed in a grass
hammock sipped at a thick clay cup of
coffee flavored with vanilla and gummy
with raw cane-syrup

  this he said lazily closing his eye
to the leaf-broken sunlight is the perfect
way to collect orchids

  and our senorita here said ramon
with his native extravagance the most
perfect orchid of all

  david grinned at ramon a gesture of
agreement without rudeness

  the girls name was rather startingly
in this place jane la-vieja ororke the
middle of it meant the old one though
that had nothing to do with jane it was
the name of a family as honored in the
history of south american freedom as are
say washington or jefferson in the north
it came to her from a frail little mother
pare snapped a shot at laredo over his log    as surely as shooting meati


	jungle

who still fluttered about the hacienda after
the sweatiness of climate and rawness of
hewing a vanilla plantation out of those
merciless jungles had killed a more robust
father of the equally famous filibustering
ororkes

  jane was accordingly exotically golden-
skinned and dark-haired and blue-eyed and
was quite appropriately called la or-
quidea the orchid just the sort of girl
before whom it was distinctly worth show-
ing off

  david sipped at his coffee and said
perfect here is eden peace-beauty-
everything

  aye said ramon where are also
serpents-as here comes one now whom
our indios reported by drum to be on the
way

the man who topped the steep river
bank before the patio did not look so
much like a serpent as like an ordinary
peon but not quite he was as swarthy
as ramon and wore a peons raggy shirt
and frayed pants and wide palmetto hat
but there was a confident insolence in his
eyes and a certain swagger in the slouch
that grew from his heel-dragging grass
jniaraches he carried a naked machete in
his hand as men must who travel the
jungle paths

   na dia a la cas he clipped the for-
mal greeting of good day to the house-
hold i bring a message he went on
from my padron the balatero of below
the great rapid to say that he will honor
himself within the next few days to come
and pay his court to the senorita
barbaridad ramon exploded and
who is this savage to offer the insolence of
his court to our senorita

  the man narrowed his bold eyes down
on ramon everyone knows who he is
and since the senorita now requires a
protector it is reasonable no

  the girls hammock ceased to swing
as if stopped by a heavy weight she
turned in it shrinking into its overlap

  ramon glowered over the crude usage
of the outer borderlands reasonable
he had to concede but not likely since
he built for himself a feud with the
estancia of roderigo pena that lies com-
fortingly between his rapids and us

stories

  the man smiled thinly none the less
he said

  and since the rancho ororke is good
friends with the estancia pena ramon
left the implication to soak in

  the man slouched to stand over him
he grinned more thinly and who are
you senor foreman to make suggestions
as to what-or whom-your senorita may
choose 

  dave got out of his hammock and
moved long-legged to face the intruder
since our friend ramon is incapacitated
in one arm he said softly perhaps it
would be better that you should talk to
me

  pero seguro the man smiled even
more thinly upon dave certainly i will
talk with you he let his naked machete
swing idly before him you will be that
norte-amerciano spy of your big business
of whom we have heard no

  caa-nas-ss-tos it was tom from
ramon that does it

  through fingers to her lips jane
warned be careful senor david the
man is a machetero it was like saying
a gunman

  so then senor norte-americano the
man smiled easily since we talk of what
is better-it would be better that you
should go to the devil back to your own
country before my padron comes it is i
who tell you this standing here before
you

  caa-a-nass-s-s  

  ramon held his breath on the fading sib-
ilant the girls fingers pressed her lip
white against her teeth as motionless as
though a snake had hissed the whole
patio seemed to hold its breath

  let us dave put his hands ostenta-
tiously into his pockets talk this thing
over like civilized people

the mans narrowed eyes opened
in wide surprise he didnt know
about codes other than his own but that
a man tall and apparently whole should
refuse his challenge meant here la comida
de zopilotes a dinner of buzzards or eat-
ing crow so surprised was the man that
he let david take him by the arm and
lead him from the patio -

  the prtio breathed again the rancho
matto grosso fury



foreman let his breath go through blown-
out cheeks the girl bit not her fingers
but her lip till a red spot showed darker
than its full carmine the foreman kicked
his hammock to swinging his eyes re-
mained fixed in a minute examination of a
corner of the rancho roof at last he
turned to look at the girl

  it would seem he said that being
tough with just a jaguar is not enough
jane looked only at her finger nails
bit at some tiny roughness and yet her
frown showed her wonderment he has
a certain courage

  ramon shrugged they are a difficult
people to understand

  both hammocks swayed in silence but
for the rustly creaking of their hooks

  david came back alone ramon rose to
a joyful hope you took him away to
hew him down where the senorita would
not see yes

  david shook his head his somber look
showed his understanding of everyone
elses hopeless misunderstanding noth-
ing would be gained by killing the man
he stated his back-home credo

  ramon shrugged again with down-
turned lips or by being perhaps oneself
killed eh and addressed himself point-
edly to the girl though i may remain
desolate my counsel is to sell this rancho
and take the little mother to the safety
of the far city for laredo gomez is one
who gets what he wants un bravo endiablo
y un- he bit back obscene descriptions
forgive my sentiments senorita but
there he is established and he has been
working these four years without a con-
science gobbling up all the territory from
his ravine to the upper rapids until he is
now king of the balateros   

  just who david inquired is this
gomez 

  ramon gave angry information that
none the less had a certain pride in ex-
ploit

  an offspring of ten fathers is laredo
all of them devils a gatherer of the
valuable balata gum that your northern
manufacturers prefer over rubber for in-
sulating under-water cables he works a
crew of collected ruffians whose totally
added-up principles would be rejected by
a snake and he pointed his pessimism
between his territory and here there re-

mains now only the forest worked by
roderigo pena

  he used to work here jane added
until- she paused coloring

  until his upstart insolence became un-
bearable ramon growled

  he was always at least polite

  as polite as the serpent of eden pur-
suing his ends

  and now hes a jungle big shot david
added it up and he wants to marry you
or perhaps ramon said darkly not
even marry-now that the padron senor
ororke of whom alone in this region he
was not afraid but a little wary has
passed to god

  daves brows wrent up is that so

  it is exactly so ramon snapped in
return this rancho needs a man one as
tough as he

  perhaps said dave to sell and get
out would be the best thing to do-if i
may he forgiven for butting into some-
thing thats none of my business which
is orchids   will you be guiding me
down-river tomorrow ramon to that
place of which you spoke

  so the senorita has ordered ramon
said shortly while this laredo ladron
is already crawling like a viper to establish
a footing above his ravine

  for balata perhaps daves tone was
indifferent but orchids i have been able
to collect even in the gold country that
some have called prohibido

  ramon looked at jane quite beyond
understanding he said sourly

  david didnt understand what he meant

david strained practised mus-
cles to hold the dug-out canoe in
the current that piled up slick and deep
with little under-surface eddies gathering
its strength for its charge into the granite
maw of the gorge that thrust out of the
close jungle greenery like a forbidding
gateway down that slavering gullet he
could see vivid colors sparkling in the
white spray his voice dropped to match
the swish and rumble that welled out of
the mist as though he were reciting verse
to the accompaniment of music

  those rocks and cliffs ramon where
you say nobody has been  in their deep
shades one might find even a new species
	jungle

  ramons quick surge of negation
rocked the canoe not with my help you
wont valgame dios nor with anybody
in these parts even though he might be
as mad as an americano of the north
that is a place where canoes dont live
death lives here is the last landmark
here civilization ends below is laredo
gomez balata kingdom

  there was cynicism in davids laugh
this is civilizations boundary some
friends have told me that it ended quite
a bit farther north

  yes at your american border i have
heard the padron say as he fought to
hold what he had built here he would
say life is the accident death the surety

  the ororkes experience proved its
truth as thumping suddenly thickly out of
the jungle screen muted and blanketed
by the massed greenery a fat bullet
plopped into the water a dozen feet ahead
of the canoe and ricochetted out of a little
geyser to smack into a tree on the farther
bank the wooded steep caught up the
echo and flung it back across the ravine
and that side redoubled it to strike back
higher up again and again to crackle at
last thinly out into the strip of open sky
the stillness of the appalled jungle crea-
tures followed and then a big red howler
monkey shouted its defiance and the ravine
roared back at it

  long seconds before that dave was
furiously plying his paddle driving the
craft to the shelter of the farther bank
ramon was shouting at him above the
uproar

  not that way madman the other
bank  or hell shoot again that is a
signal in these parts to come in and be
inspected

  hell i dont answer to bullets dave
humped his shoulders and heaved on his
paddle the harder the canoe slid into the
almost black shadow of low overhanging
branches dave snatched up the light rifle
and was ashore before ramon recovered
from the grating jolt that had sprawled
him then dave had him under an arm
and was hoisting him with himself behind
the shelter of a vast soleiman bole spiked
with knife-like thorns

  ramons first readiness to obey the rude
summons flung from a gun-muzzle was re-
placed by rage that would be one of

stories

laredos animals i told you he was ex-
panding his territory    look under that
purple jacaranda there eight or ten inches
down where the red flower shows see his
hat there see him move you can per-
haps get him from here and a hundred
souls will laugh in welcoming hell
dave made no move to shoot im
hunting orchids not men

  infiemos give me then the gun
ramon snatched for it with but one
hand yet   

  but dave held tight to the weapon his
lips were thin with stubborn conviction
im looking for no war with any balata
man im a peaceable collector of  

  it is well senores that your intentions
are at least peaceable the voice cut
down on them with a soft sibilance

both jerked around twist-
ing their necks to see the cold round
hole of an old-fashioned rifle muzzle look-
ing down on them from a copal bush
and above it a face a face smoothly dark
like a handsome cats and it grinned high
cheek bones showed that proud spanish
blood had not been too proud somewhere
down the line though dominant enough to
have established a jungle dynasty

  laredo ramons recognition was
surly

  the man narrowed his eyes in the
pretended effort of a famous man to recall
some less prominent individual you
know me of course his vanity was grat-
ified you will be-let me see now-ah
yes the so faithful foreman of the rancho
rorque-who is in love with the senorita
is it not

  dave suddenly stared round at ramon
whose thoughts whatever they were were
hidden under a scowl of bitter hatred
laredo grinned back at it you should
have known better my friend than to dis-
regard an order to go ashore my good
ruiz over there might have fired again
this time in earnest had he not known that
i paralleled him on this side

  the very extravagance of the mans
politeness in his aped idiom of a caballero
was a threat

  ramon had the hardihood to loose a
ripple of the personal invective for which
his language is so well suited laredos
matto grosso fury



cat eyes flickered and then grinned from
ramon to dave

  and this then will be the new yanqui
who now takes up so much of the senoritas
time a quite providential bag i would
say all with one shot

  daves cheeks were flattened with rage
as he threw his standard civilized indig-
nation at the man by what the hell right
cabron do you hold up an american citi-
zen minding his own business

  laredo showed clean white teeth in
sheer enjoyment aha a fine spirit of
courage this is not as my reports have
had it and you speak of rights here
cra you have not heard then that my
poor friend roderigo pena of the upper
ravine has suddenly died and-bequeathed
to me this territory

  died when of what ramon ex-
ploded in astonishment

  laredo shrugged his eyebrows and
shoulders together i am not a physician
to discuss deaths only a poor balata
gatherer striving to develop some meager
livelihood for the shall we say backward
people of my country and to protect it-
the mans moustachios laid back on his
cheeks in a feline grin-protect it senor
from should we say again northern
capitalistic exploitation he smiled at
david you from north america under-
stand of course

  the grin died away to its underlying
hate the which we shall discuss senores
not at this water level where the piume
flies are oppressive but in some shady
spot along my jungle path above and
under the unbiassed judgment of some
other young men who are also patriotically
interested in my endeavors only with
your permission i shall carry the good
rifle

with superb arrogance the man
turned to go first leaving them to
follow behind any man who would dare
that much bravado dave was convinced
must be deadly sure of the situation the
only precaution the fellow took was to
draw his machete and flick at vines that
trailed thorns across the way he zig-
zagged leisurely up the steep slope drop-
ping easy persifflage over his shoulder

  a collector i am told you present

yourself of orchids an avocation it
would seem in which there is little profit
but much opportunity to spy out the land
for what your people call commercial de-
velopment

  i have my papers dave fell back
upon another convention of back home to
show that i am a collector

  laredo laughed does one in your
north then where so many can write
still believe in identity of papers and
even if so-they tell me that vanilla is
also an orchid-an enterprising young
man could have an ambition is it not to
collect a whole plantation of them along
with their owner

  why you son of a    daves angry
words broke off and he shouted look
out and snatched at laredo from be-
hind  his hand closed on the fellows upper
arm jerked him back and whirled him
his feet trundling the ground  and in the
same move dave had the machete in his
own hand

  ramon spat ferociously youve got
him amigo i have his feet split him now
like a melon

  but dave was ahead of them both
hacking swift strokes at the greenery of
a bush slender coils splotched ruddy
brown and gray green over a leprous
yellow belly slipped reluctantly from the
broken twigs

  you talk too damn careless dave was
grinding his heel on the things head
wise guy huh so monkey-pleased with
yourself that you dont look ahead thats
how a fer-de-lance gets to hit a man in
the face after that you cant apply a
tourniquet anywhere

  laredo was scrambling to his feet a
little dazed and his face suddenly haggard
with the tight lines that the close finger
of death can draw cra-ticulas he was
mumbling hombre you have an eye-
sight there

  such as is needed dave told him
grimly in looking for orchids

  laredo shook himself as a cat might
that has escaped one death and is instantly
bold again in its knowledge of eight good
lives left he could afford to be sleekly
apologetic

  senor compels me to believe him who
but a true botanist as foolish as a virgin
would be so mad as to pass up an oppor-
	jungle

tunity such as you have just lost cra-a-
ss-sissimos my good friend ramon here
for example in his excitement would sure-
ly have    but we shall let that pass
too-for the present

  sleek and purring but the claws re-
mained under the silk for the present
friend ramon which speaking of pres-
ents although no caballero but a poor
balatero of the jungles i can do no other
than reciprocate he cupped fingers in-
geniously to his lips and emitted the long
drawn yowl of a puma a signal senor
to my good lads on the path above that
you have convinced me that you are not
a commercial spy thus i present you with
permission to go alive from our territory

dave was staring at the man won-
dering whether he understood all the
implications of that gift only dimly realiz-
ing how accidental was life where the
padron ororke had hewn him an estate

  although-laredo shrugged again
and showed the white smile-you con-
vince me too that i have a worthy com-
petition for this rarest orchid of our
country-to whom convey please my re-
spects and my assurance that i laredo
gomez do not relinquish hope-ever  and
that i shall present myself losing no time
he bowed like a caballero adios
senores go with god i shall expose
myself upon some rock so that my good
ruiz and his men across the river may
know that you have permission

  his mastery of the situation was su-
preme as he turned and went to the hill
leaving even the rifle behind him

  ramon looked at it hungrily his fingers
clawing for the feel of it and then he
said he will have half a dozen of his
ruffians down the path to the canoe scowl-
ingly he paddled through a long silence
then ramon exploded

  death of ten gods his very thoughts
are an insult to the senorita

  perhaps- dave paddled through
many seconds before he finished it-he
can be stopped-somehow

  but certainly he can be stopped you
could have stopped him his machete to
your hand i would have stopped him had
i it even knowing that his henchmen
covered us with this rifle he could be

stories

stopped now as look he has the effrontery
to stand upon that eminence signalling his
assistant devil ruiz

  laredo waved the friendliest confirma-
tion of his permission his voice carried
faintly over the water inform the senor-
ita that alarmed by your competition i
laredo gomez shall present myself so
soon as i shall have consolidated myself in
my new territory where some upstarts of
the roderigo family are disputing my
claim-or perhaps even sooner he could
have been a fraternity member announcing
honest rivalry

  ramon at the forward paddle snatched
backwards for the rifle son of the ten
thousand if i but thought i could get
him from here and the hell with his gang
ashore with gods luck they could all
miss us

  but dave kept his knee weighed down
by all his civilized inhibitions on the rifle
in the bottom of the canoe he paddled
through a half hours silence the evening
cool was bringing the jungle to life a
troop of cebus monkeys shrilled affright
and abuse at some tree cat that stalked
them macaws screeched raucously and
sped in pairs across the widening river
with the flash of red and blue rockets
a fat curassow flopped clumsily to perch
on a far overhanging branch

  dave emerged from his tight-lipped in-
trospection good white meat he let
the canoe slide took up the rifle and fired
the bird plummeted into the water

  car-r-rambas it broke from ramon
you can shoot like that and you let him
go or dont you yet understand that he
murdered roderigo

  dave said nothing only directed the
canoe towards the floating bird picked it
up mechanically shook off its surface wet-
ness paddled on staring at the mirror
sheen of the water as though he saw re-
flections of himself most of them scowl-
ing derisively at him to be blinked im-
patiently away and replaced by others that
stared puzzled and in complete lack of
sympathy

in the hacienda patio when the
tale had been luridly told over the coffee
by ramon and moodily edited by dave
he found jane looking at both of them
matto grosso fury



in the same way

  but-but a gunshot is the recognized
way to signal over the roar of the waters
and he-he was polite as he has always
been of course he held a gun on you
until he might know who you were every-
body does that here and everybody is
suspicious of course of being exploited
by yanqui capital but as soon as he knew
he did nothing to you in fact there was
a tinge almost of disappointment nobody
did anything

  but surely ramon sulked the
senor did much only it was the wrong
snake that he killed

  janes eyes glowed for the moment on
dave and then there was a question in
them again wondering whether he agreed
in that inexorable opinion dave looked
away from her

  i-dont know was as far as he
would commit himself but he felt that
explanation was necessary to placate
ramon he faced him

  you have said that your civilization
comes as far as the ravine i will tell you
then that in the civilization of the mad-
men of the north there are many millions
of people whole statesful of them who
admit no excuse for the killing of a fellow
human not even by their governments
ramon stared at him searching his face
for vacuous weakness not finding it he
said slowly and the cure for madness i
have heard is a shock worse than the sick-
ness the good god give that you remain
mad

  janes rather forced laugh dispersed the
mens seriousness your whole talk is
mad you are attributing all sorts of
wickedness to laredo gomez only because
he-because both of you- confusion
flamed in her cheeks and she changed the
subject come dave and look ive found
an orchid for you right here in the moist
ground behind the kitchen

  she did show him a bloom plucked a
lovely thing that strongly scented the air
but that was not what she brought him
away for what do you really think of
laredo her hand was on his arm tight-
ly gripping her urgency

  dave was staring at her eyes not at the
flower i-dont know i dont know
conditions here he was-polite ramon
seems to think deadly polite because

completely master of-i dont know what
the girls eyes clouded ramon is a
dear and faithful to the death perhaps
a lee-tle over-zealous because-yes la-
redo has always been polite and masterly
too-he has organized a little army down
there they say he is at all events a
man

  dave stared at her you-like him
his question was almost an accusation

  she didnt answer that instead she said
as though neither of them had known it
before look this orchid has a scent
smell she held it toward him he still
stared at her only unconsciously inhaling
the flowers fragrance she too without
conscious volition drew closer obeying
her own injunction to smell their faces
were close over the flowers crimson con-
voluted lip then dave saw her eyes close
his own too-closely-focused vision swept
beyond her and the flower was crushed
between their lips

  she drew away slowly her eyes opened
and blinked away an incongruous wetness
now i shall feel safe

  dave was drawing her back to him
only looking his question

  because she confessed to his khaki
shirt there have been times since i have
been alone that i have been afraid-
amongst all these lawless men but as long
as you are here i shall feel safe

  as long as i- dave was not com
scious of having inspired any such con
fidence why

  because foolish one jane lifted her
lips without any intervening flower you
are a civilized man-and you will behave
like one

  then she released herself murmur-
ing poor ramon i dont know how
to tell him but i know he will be-hon-
estly glad for me but not this evening
tomorrow i shall make courage

  tomorrow said dave i shall go into
the hills back there and collect a million of
these orchids

tomorrow manana everything
happens manana in those far places
south of the border sometimes faster
than the north thinks next day in the
foot hills dave heard a gunshot coming
from the direction of the hacienda he
	jungle

didnt like that nobody there hunted
the peons wouldnt have a gun ramon-but
why would ramon want to fire a shot
a signal perhaps dave decided he had
better go back he started walking but
the nearer he came to the house the faster
he walked till he was running and when
he came quite close his heart was choking
off his already strangled breath in his
throat for he could hear the inchoate
clamour of south of the border that takes
its emotions noisily

  as he charged past the deserted ser-
vants quarters around to the front that
overhung the river people milled about
him peons house servants all buzzing at
once mumbling murmuring incoherently
like bees hiveless who had found a leader
daves anxiety flared to fury at their
meaningless yammerings a woman clung
to him screeching he shoved her off
angrily and then he saw that it was the
fluttery frail senora of the house all she
could pronounce was my daughter my
poor daughter

  the mob surged dave toward a smaller
mob and that one immediately detached
itself from its interest to coalesce with
the larger swarm and each shrill its com-
plaint

  its interest had been ramon he lay
propped up against a moss-grown stone
gate post he had bled frightfully was
still bleeding through the fingers of a
woman who had a cloth to his chest he
could speak coherently saving his words

  grac al buen dios you come  at
last he pointed down river he came-
as he had said losing no time with half
a dozen of his thugs

  dave was losing no time with stupidly
obvious questions perhaps some of the
romero balateros down the road can be
organized

  ramon waved the suggestion off with
a weak hand under a leader perhaps
but-time he will be going fast-two
hours start-to his own country below
the gorge

  daves heart was thick in his throat
again to choke off his voice ramon was
desperately saving of words one chance
-the canoe

  dave swallowed and said the obvious
this time ramon you will die here if
i-

stories

  ramons hand pushed feebly at him
so will she-unless- his face twisted
in a wracked grin you said you wanted
to go-some day and i-i told you it
would have to be alone his voice came
stronger i denounce the fatherless ani-
mal before god i name him for the ten-
thousand sins of his mother i-

time dave shoved the chittering
peons from before him and tumbled
down the river embankment over the
buzzing of the swarm that he left behind
he could hear ramons fearful invective
that he was taking with him to lay before
god dave fell into the canoe nearly
swamped it-baled it frantically and
shoved off

  he didnt know what he was going to
do or what he could do-alone the race
down the river gave little opportunity to
plan the strain of sheer physical endeavor
for speed left scant room for thinking
speed for what vaguely the pattern
set itself in his mind that he must contrive
to cut off the raiders somewhere along the
path vaguely too came a small comfort-
ing reminder that his rifle that he always
carried into the jungles still bumped
against his back on its web strap

  speed time how far might six hurry-
ing men have shoved hustled carried a
girl along a jungle trail in two hours of
start too far the mounting rage of
futility burned in each heaving gasp

  the canoe was looking down into the
maw of the gorge before dave had co-
herent plans but hope at least had come
to him ten miles of rapids ramon had
told him roared through that defile there
by heaven would be speed much faster
than men on a rocky path if-

  he shot the canoe into the suck of the
dark water between the granite buttresses
that scowled their keep out the gorge
roared in his ears and took hold of him in
a liquid avalanche that showed him how
puny were strong muscles and a fine spray
that dimmed the bulk of rocks wickedly
ahead rushing up at him gnashing jagged
teeth speed at all events he had

  canoes ramon had said out of his ex-
perience didnt live in that gorge-and
soon disaster came as easily as disaster
always can an insignificant submerged
matto grosso fury



rock hardly big enough to cause any sur-
face flurry took the edge of the canoe and
turned it neatly over dave was plucked
away and rolled under and over and
around like any other flotsam before an-
other rock deflected him again to the sur-
face

  death ramon said lived in that gorge
death was undoubtedly preparing to do
business but death alone of all con-
tingencies always had time as yet the
river played with dave sucked at him
spewed him out tossed him hurtled him
along spun him finally playfully into an
eddy where dave was able to swim to and
clutch at a great snag of a tree left
stranded from last seasons rains he was
able to haul himself along to where its
shattered stem was imbedded in a little
oasis of clean white sand littered with
other flotsam with the help of a dead
gray root he was able to heave himself
to his feet and he tried to shout his exul-
tation but all he succeeded in doing was to
belch hugely

  one thought surged in his mind he had
won time surely that at least no-
body could have traveled the twists and ups
and downs of a cliffside trail with that
fearful speed they would be coming
along presently dragging jane with them
damn their black souls and then what
six of them dave still had had no time
to think what he might do but they would
be along surely they would be coming
fate even in this savage country couldnt
be so brute merciless as to have let them
already go by

  he must find the trail wherever it
would be winding and dipping along on the
hillside behind him he must contrive
something some desperate thing that
would be good against six armed men he
must-and then dave knew that the fates
and the gods who ruled here were those
sardonic heathen ones who grant favours
and take their payment in immediate
twisted antithesis

  he lived and he had won time but-
he looked madly at his hillside at the
sun at the river and he saw it the
trail there it was an unmistakable beaten
path dipping down from broken rocks to
cross a strip of sandy beach-and the
brute gods of the river and jungle had
spewed him out on the other side

the river raced along chuckling
and roaring its laughter at him a
mile-two miles-he couldnt see how
much farther the rapids extended thirty
feet across-a little thirty feet but noth-
ing alive could swim across not even a
fish the best they could do was to let
themselves be whirled down a mile in a
few minutes and then work their way
back snuggling banks and backwaters in
hours

  daves reaction of exhaustion swept
over him and he sagged down against his
dead tree even his futile hope of cutting
off the gang was hopeless he lay a shape-
less heap on the hot moist sand numb in
body dead in mind

  till suddenly above the roar of the
river he was conscious of a muted shout
more shouts a fury of cursing they
were coming thirty feet away only a
little thirty feet across an uncrossable
gulf

  and then those heathen gods laughed
at him and told him what a man could
do it seemed to dave that he could see
their eyes staring at him out of jungle
shadows cynical malicious he could hear
their voices chuckling in the river

  civilisation ends at your american
border

  daves voice coughed some of their
water from his lungs to croak a hoarse
no

  or the insidious voices chuckled
does it end when things come very close
to home

  dave said nothing eyes voices his
inhibited soul was haunted

  angry shouts dragged his mind out of
its black introspection of all his past cher-
ished illusions into the merciless glare of
day of this day of right now there
they were laredo and-only three it
seemed of his gang well four of them
or six what did it matter what mattered
was that they were dragging the girl be-
tween them

  dave lurched up not giving a damn
from behind his tree trunk recklessly wav-
ing his arms yelling jane

  the men on the other side bunched to-
gether cra-ticulas dave could hear the
yelp of surprise ruiz flung up his rifle
his foot kicked a little shower of sand
as he leaned forward to fire his heavy
	jungle

big-bore bullet swatted into daves tree

  and with that reminder that life here
was the accident dave suddenly knew that
the heathen gods of that place were su-
premely right he knew exactly what a
man could do what a man must do

  the sensitive lips bit down on hard
unaesthetic words on heathen words of
the renounced faith

  principles huh nothing ever settled
by-the hell it isnt dave tore at the web
strap that held the rifle to his back he
snapped the bolt out and in a slim brass
cartridge slipped smoothly into place

another fat bullet suddenly
dragged at the pocket of his jacket
the furious crafty sanity of a man who
fights for things very close to home
dropped him behind his log

  laredo gomez was tugging at the girls
wrist cursing her sudden resistance

  human life yeah as fast as shoot-
ing at a fat curassow dave snapped a
shot at laredo over his log as surely as
shooting meat laredo let go of the girls
wrist spun and pitched head and shoul-
ders in the water

  the river gods who held the agency for
death in this ravine shouted and dragged
at him dave shouted as savagely

  the gang as fast as apes jumped be-
hind sheltering rocks a fusilade of bullets
came dave yelled defiance

  the gods were lifting laredos shoul-
ders his body swayed out into the stream
anchored only by his feet a man dashed
from his shelter to clutch at them

  fool dave fired again the man
lurched over laredo his weight launched
both of them into the current the gods

stories

chuckled and took them away

  jane was standing petrified in the pose
where laredos grip on her wrist had
left her dave yelled at her

  duck you little fool splinters

  a bullet thumped into his tree and
showered splinters into his own face
blood spurted red before his eyes his
body heaved up and fell back yells came
from the other side the redness before
daves eyes was more than blood he
pushed himself up on dizzy knees to see
jane struggling with one man to deflect
his rifle the other one was eagerly watch-
ing for another shot at wherever dave
might show up

  damned punk dave fired twice fast
before that one clutched at his stomach
and slowly kneeled and even more slowly
dipped his face into the sand the man
with whom jane struggled yelled and tore
himself loose he darted behind a rock
from that to another dave could catch
fleeting glimpses of him running between
river fringe bushes deer ran like that
panicked and without thought dave
watched now as he had watched many
times for deer he saw his chance and
dropped the man as he had dropped deer

  then he stood up and shouted orders
jane he had to point up river to sup-
plement his shout go on back to head
of rapids where i can swim across
janes voice carried back to him all
right i think-its safe-now

  the grimness that looked out of daves
eyes was something that the friends in
their civilized fragment of the map had
never seen daves hard-bitten lips barely
moved as he spoke

  you can damn well bet its safe-now
blood for the juju

 by alexander wallace

      what was the real story behind the vanishing safari and the
      hidden intotela temple bengel knew    but bengel was dead

two reports slammed against my eardrums

the cobras head disappeared

he made an odd little

figure framed in the opening of
my tent he was about forty-five

-jungle-summer

i judged with narrow hunched shoulders
he wore a shapeless drill suit blue goggles
and an enormous pith helmet quite the
largest i had ever seen it made him look


	jungle

like an animated mushroom kula my
somal headman who stood grinning be-
hind him caught my eye

  kendi lu ikoke bwana said he with
his deep chuckle a phrase which for us
had much the same meaning as angel
has for a bankrupt playwright something
for kula to flatter and fleete when my back
was turned

  bring chop for the bwana i dismissed
him with a scowl

  youre professor hurst of course
said i offering my hand to the little chap
a naturalist i presume

  no i dabble in archaeology mr buck-
land he replied shyly i am very happy
that you found it possible to accept my
offer

  his offer via native runner and a forked
stick had caught up with me at senze
six months on the kind of terms he offered
had sounded very good to me and id
headed back for ngomano fast mozam-
bique was feeling the aftermath of world
war  at that time and angels like
hurst were rare game i had pitched camp
about half a mile up-river from the post

  from your letter i understand that sir
richard erskane recommended me to you

i said

  oh yes he laughed you have quite
a reputation in london clubs you should
know how erskane talks

  i did i had served under the doughty
baronette as a scout during the campaign
in deutsch oest africa when we chased
but never caught up with the elusive mem-
dome as the natives called him-famous
for his cruelty and his whimsies for the
glass he wore in his eye for his knowledge
of their own language and customs and
for his escape when a giant caravan of
porters impressed on the way vanished
with the german into the menacingly ver-
dant jungles where large scale maps still
showed a blank

  its not a hunting trip you have in mind
professor said i as kula came in with
the coffee and chop

  bless my soul no said he with a laugh
ive never let off anything more dangerous
than a pop-gun

while we ate he told me all about
the object of his trip he was a
pleasant little fellow and he did seem to

stories

know a great deal about archaeology hed
never been to africa before but he knew
all there was to be known from books he
spoke portuguese and german and was not
at all conceited about his learning i liked
him from the start

  in lisbon hed picked up an old manu-
- script a journal kept more than two hun-
dred years ago by a capuchian friar named
father jerome who had written an account
of an ancient temple he had seen up in
the chengwari country according to the
good fathers account there were inscrip-
tions carved in the face of the cliffs near
the temple

   he unrolled two maps on the table one
a large scale map of the district the best
procurable he assured me the other was
a quaint old map made bv father jerome
there were neat little drawings of castel-
lated towns showing the position of native
kraals and all the chiefs thereof were called
dukes marquises and counts i
gathered that the old missionary must
have run into a good deal of lion trouble
and had been seeing them in his sleep for
he had written across all the empty spaces
hie sunt leones but his map did agree
with the modern one in general

  im convinced that father jerome saw
the temple said hurst the question is
do you think we can locate it from such a
crude map

  well i didnt think id have much
trouble in finding his temple if there was
one i was accustomed to finding my way
in the jungle i thought that if the ancient
shrine were half of what father jerome
made it out to be the zu-beni who were
said to inhabit the district would be able
to give us information what bothered me
was the fact that i would have to hire
porters at ngomano not that i had any-
thing against the companhia do nyassa
but i did have plenty against senhor
manoel barahona their agent at the post

  wrhen i was a raw lad just out from
the states id signed up with the company
and they had sent me up to barahona as
his assistant he was a big brute of a man
hed been a ships officer and still thought
he was slave driving he ran the post like
a bucko mate life had delt kindly with
me up to the time i arrived at ngomano
and mine was the self-assurance the arro-
gance of the youngster who has yet to learn
blood for

his chastisments i ran foul of him about
a week after my arrival he gave me the
worst beating ive ever taken and kicked
me out i mean that literally id have died
of exposure if kula hadnt dragged me off
to his hut and nursed me back on my feet
for a couple of years after that and all
through the campaign in german east
africa id been nursing the idea that one
day id go back to ngomano just to see
what barahona could do to a man full
grown and hardened by years of trekking
and the rough and tumble of life in military
camps

  well need twelve men professor said
i ill send kula over to ngomana to hire
them pershaps youd care to go along 

of course it was my job to hire the
men and he gave me a surprised look
but i didnt think anything would be gained
by explaining the situation to him i ex-
pected barahona would forbid the villagers
to work for me he collected a gratuity
from the guides and white hunters in his
territory it was not like him to let a catch
like the professor slip through his fingers

  the professor trudged off with kula
while i sat in my tent to await events

  kula was back in an hour i knew it had
happened as soon as he came running into
my tent he was bleeding at the mouth and
his eyes bulged

  the portuguesa he gasped out he
say no porters for you bwana

  he hit you kula eh  why 

  kula spat out blood and his eyes flashed
he is the father of lies bwana i hear
him talk to bwana hurst he say you steal
from him one time he drive you plenty
he say i say that damn lie and he drive
me

  it was too much for me i couldnt sit
there while barahona gave me a reputation
a skunk would shudder at besides no-
body could hit kula not if i was around
and able to hit back i slammed on my hel-
met and hit the trail for ngomana

  come along i shouted at kula over
my shoulder you may have to pick up
the pieces again

  the post consisted of half-a-dozen cor-
rugated iron sheds with barahonas
thatched bungalow in the center of the
compound with a tall flag-staff beside it
the road up from the river passed through

the juju	

the native village which crouched on the
bare slope of the hill it hadnt changed
much since id seen it last evidently a
caravan had come in recently for a gang
of blacks were sacking ivory for shipment
down river and making a lot of noise about
it the tapping of coopers hammers com-
ing from the oil shed made an accom-
paniment to their toneless chanting the
stench of palm-oil and dried fish hung
like a haze over the hard red earth of the
compound

  i headed straight for the store it was
the same big square room as hot as an
oven with a long counter and shelves
piled with trade goods-all the features
of a woolworth department store except
there wasnt anything you could buy for
a dime a couple of white men lounged
in rattan chairs with a table between them
drinking gin i didnt know them but i
guessed that one of them was barahonas
candidate for my job the senhor himself
was talking to the professor with his
elbows resting on the counter he hadnt
changed much either a little flabbier per-
haps his skin was blotchy and the jungle
bags under his close-set eyes were more
conspicuous than when id last seen him
but he was still a very big hunk of man
and the old fear and hatred of him struck
at my stomach like fangs he straightened
up as i came in and stared at me for a
moment then his booming voice filled the
room

  holy saints it is the yankee sneak-
thief and he has grown a beard 

after that i didnt care what hap-
ened i walked up to the counter
for a moment the power of speech seemed
to desert me then pent-up hate poured
out of me like bilge-water my portu-
guese was not of the kind one sees in
print but it was fluent rich in burning
oaths and invective and id had five years
in which to compose a suitable verbal
description of barahonas attributes the
two portuguese were staring at me with
their mouths hanging open barahona
listened with a fixed smile on his thick
lips until i ran down like a mechanical
toy then he turned to the professor
shook his head and said in english

  you see what a man he is first he
robs me now he comes back to abuse
	jungle

me some are like that you cannot beat
honesty into them no it is deep in them
one must cut it out

  an afflux of blood pounded in my ears
i leaned over the counter and drove my
fist into his mouth it was a sharp sting-
ing blow and when he wiped his mouth
blood showed on the btk of his hand he
looked at it with a surprised expression
then roared out a string of oaths and
vaulted the counter the board floor shook
and bottles rattled on the shelves as he
landed on my side

  often i had dreamed of this moment
i had planned what i would do to the last
detail but it didnt happen as id seen it
his huge fist smashed through my guard
in his first attack and drove me back against
the wall i kicked him off and got a couple
of hard blows home to the pit of his stom-
ach he roared and came at me with his
head down he hit me again and again
the room whirled i lost all sense of time
barahonas face grimaced at me out of a
red haze i smashed at it desperately while
his punches thudded into my body and
exploded in my face i wondered vaguely
why i was still on my feet i saw barahona
stagger back against the counter he reeled
along it and his breathing filled the room
then i knew i was on my feet because
he couldnt kock me down a hoarse yell
of exultation came to my lips with bubbles
of blood i leaped at him and struck and
struck in a kind of frenzy until he lay at
my feet groaning his face beaten into a
bloody pulp

  i became aware of the professors voice
he was pulling at my arm

  come away buckland he urged
come away

  i followed him in a daze my legs feel-
ing as if hundred pound weights were
attached to them every movement was
agony half way across the compound my
knees buckled under me and consciousness
slipped away

when i came to i was stretched
on the cot in my tent the pro-
fessor was dabbing my face with an as-
tringent it smarted like hell and i sat up

  iiow long have i been out i de-
manded

  quite some time man you dont know
when youre licked kula came over and

stories

helped me to get you home

  there was something in the way he said
it that made me look at him curiously he
had his goggles off his eyes were deep-
set blue with a metallic glint in them they
gave him a personality that seemed to con-
tradict my first impression of him

  i dont know what to think of you
buckland said he

  i smiled wryly maybe you like to have
another man for the trip i said

  no said he with an amused smile
senhor barahona tells a good story but
i prefer erskanes recommendation and my
own judgment

  well thank you for that said i
warmly i rose stiffly my body felt as if
an elephant had used it for a foot mat
he watched as i buckled on my gun belt
what are you going to do he asked
hire a dozen men and get started i
replied barahonas memory is no shorter
than mine well trek before he decides
what to do about it

  the professor looked worried i got
the impression that senhor barahona was
much interested in this trip buckland
what do you know of him

i shrugged hes the big boss in these
parts does as much trading on his owtt
account as he does for the company
do you mean he steals from his em-
players the professor looked shocked

  most agents wouldnt call it stealing
i explained he gives the natives short
measure for their gold dust and ivory-
saves a pound of beads here and a yard of
cloth there until enough is accumulated to
trade for a few prime tusks for himself
how ingenious commented the pro-
fessor thoughtfully i can understand how
its done with gold dust but ivory is rather
bulky how does he manage to get it out
of the country

  the companhia do nyassa would like
to know that said i with a grin but
its a big country professor and there are
as many interlopers unlicensed traders
as there are companys agents as for
barahonas interest in the trip dont worry
about it he figured to get the job for one
of his pals and take his cut thats all

  i walked over to the village the head-
man produced twelve men without argu-
ment which surprised me a little for id
come expecting a refusal but evidently
blood for the juju	

barahona hadnt got around to forbidding
them to work for me i marched them into
the compound to pick up the professors
loads which he had brought up with him
barahona didnt show himself one of the
portugues came to the door of the store
and stood watching me as i lined up the
loads but he made no attempt to interfere
i gave him a cocky boa tarde senhor
and marched out again

he first four days of our
route lay southward through dense
forest and jungle grass ten feet high until
we reached melaso river and followed its
course toward the chengwari mountains
we did most of our marching in the early
morning and late afternoon and spent the
hottest part of the day in camp the pro-
fessor studied his maps picked thorns out
of his legs and kept a sharp lookout for
snakes

  lord but that little man had guts the
sun burned him cruely and the mosquitoes
feasted on his raw flesh he went down
with fever but as soon as id filled him
with quinine and his temperature came
down he was clamoring to go on again
i supposed he had the true spirit of the
scientist if hed been told there was an
undeciphered inscription on a red hot stone
in hell hed have clamped on his goggles
and absurd helmet and gone down after it

  we followed the river into wooded foot-
hills they rose before us in two pitches
enclosing and concealing a labyrinth of
valleys some shallow and several miles in
breadth others deep narrow and as dark
as a mine

  late that afternoon we came out onto
fairly open and elevated country with a
gorgeous view of the chengwari range in
the foreground a massive lump of granite
reared two hundred feet above the green
palms and mimosa with their cream balls
and feathery foliage it divided the river
into twin streams the streams raced be-
tween high wooded banks that threw a cool
green light on the swift-flowing water
herds of gazelles zig-zagged across patches
of amber pasture land their beige and white
markings merging with their background
so that they were seen and gone in a flash
a path branched off from the river it was
somewhat broader than the usual jungle
road which is seldom wider than a mans

foot a little farther on we came across a
log buried across the path and dirty rags
fluttered from stripped palms on either side
of the trail-charms to keep ghosts and
leopards away from the village i knew must
be nearby

  although i had not mentioned it to the
professor the fact that wed seen neither
hide nor hair of the zu-bengi had begun
to worry me we were getting low on sup-
plies we knew that we must be in the
vicinity of the temple but without a guide
we might wander among the hills and
through the maze of canyons for a year
and never find it however it was dark
before we came in sight of the village and
since your africans an unpredictable cuss
at his best especially so if you sneak up
on him after dark i gave orders to make
camp

after wed finished our meal
the professor and i sat talking and
smoking in the moonlight that filtered
through the trees in the glade where we
had our camp all around us were the
night noises of the forest its unaccountable
echoing and ghost-like sighing from across
the nearest hill came the muffled sound of
drum tapping and the moaning wail of a
horn or conch it had a peculiar tone or
rather two tones so that one seemed to
hear it first with one ear then with the
other id never heard anything quite like
it before and i sat listening with my head
cocked on one side

  its not unlike the moan of a lion
observed the professor

  or one of the guardian spooks of your
temple i said jokingly then something
happened that made me stop joking

  bwana bwa-na kulas voice rose
in a scream that had mortal terror in it
the professor and i sprang to our feet and
ran to the back of the camp kula was
standing on top of a packing case under the
tree where he had set up his oil-tin stove
there was an oil lamp fastened to the
trunk of the tree its flickering light
gleamed on his black rigid figure and on
the white under-belly of a cobra it was
six feet long if it was an inch it had
reared up one third of its length and its
distended hood was close to kulas bare
feet the poor devil was petrified with
fright and dared not move the cobra was
	jungle

hissing loudly and i knew it was prepar-
ing to strike i clawed at my gun before
i had it clear of leather flame flashed be-
fore my eyes and two reports slammed
against my ear drums the cobras head
disappeared blown clean off stupified i
turned to stare at the professor who stood
with a smoking automata in his hand he
gave me a queer little smile then slipped
the gun into a holster under his arm and
turned away the shots had roused the
camp and the men were standing around
jabbering like a cage full of baboons

  kula had gone after the professor
caught his hand and was pouring out his
gratitude i got the men quieted down and
went to join hurst i didnt speak as i
sat down facing him i figured it was up
to him to do the talking there was silence
for a moment and then

  youre thinking of pop-guns of course
buckland said he with a quizzical smile

  you are uncommonly fast with the real
thing said i i didnt know it was your
habit to carry a gun i might have added
i liked a man to carry his weapons where
they could be seen

  that snake said he with a dry cough
was one of the imponderables the sort
of thing a man cant foresee

  you dont need to apologize for that
said i but let me have it straight to
begin with if youre a professor of archae-
ology im the king of timbucto 

  i suppose i have over-plaved the part
he agreed with a smile and lapsed into
silence

  i like to know where im going i
prompted him  i dont like being led by
the nose into anything

he remained silent evidently
turning something over in his mind
look buckland he said at last im not
at liberty to speak too freely youll have
to fill in some blanks to begin for you
the war was over in  but for men of
my profession the end of one war is just
the beginning of another that may sound
cynical when everyone is quoting tenny-
son talking about the brotherhood of man
but thats the way it is well too many
rifles german mausers have been found in
native hands lately whos selling them
where do they come from its my job to
find that out

stories

  british agent eh said i

  not necessarily buckland as you
know the sale of modern rifles to natives
is forbidden by all interested governments
you know why let us call it an inter-
national problem

  the temple is part of your act of
course said i gloomily

  it is not he exclaimed we know
that one of the rifles according to the story
told by the native caught with it came
from what he called a stone kraal in this
district research produced father jeromes
map and here we are

  what made you pick on me i urged
i thought you knew about those rifles
he explained

  you suspected me i exclaimed re-
proachfully

  oh dont look so damned indignant
buckland he laughed and went on  you
were just the type a white hunter jungle
tramp picking up whatever came your way
i know more about your past than youd
care to remember

  i gave him a side-long look and decided
to say nothing there were one or two
incidents involving the disposal of a few
ivories where property rights might strike
a narrow-minded man as being a little
vague

  yes hurst went on it had to be you
or barahona involved in the rifle business
im damned glad it turned out to be him
of course hes not the man im after but
he is disposing of the ivory and gold dust
those rifles are traded for

  who are you looking for

  he rose and knocked the ashes from his
pipe when we find him we find the
rifles the job will be done and we can
go home buckland

  when we find him i echoed

  you dont have to go along if you dofit
want to said he with a grin but it will
be worth your while if you do think it
over sleep on it buckland he went to
his tent leaving me to think it out

must have sat there for a
long time i dont know what it was
that disturbed my concentration but some-
thing did i rose with a tingling sensation
running up and down my spine the camp
was quiet a light wind was rustling the
palm fronds and threw moving shadows
blood for

across the clearing a jackal howled like
a lugubrious spirit close to the camp think-
ing that it had been just such a prowler
nosing among kulas pots that had roused
me i started for my tent i had taken no
more than a couple of steps when the conch
wed heard earlier in the evening blasted
the silence it was followed by the sound
of people crashing through the bush black
figures rushed at me from all directions

 got my gun out but was snatched from
my hand before i could pull the trigger
and i went down kicking and yelling under
a mass of greasy stinking blacks i heard
hursts gun go off i struggled to my knees
shouting

  a blow from a knob-kerry silenced me
when my head stopped spinning i saw
them dragging hurst toward me they
yanked us to our feet and bound our hands
behind our backs then they yoked us to-
gether with a pole that had a loop at each
end to fit around our necks it was the sort
of thing the slavers had used in the old
days they left us standing while they
looted the camp they were all big fellows
armed with square ox-hide shields and
spears they went through our stuff like a
bunch of women at a rummage sale i got
a real shock when i saw our own men
join in the fun and i understood why
barahona hadnt interfered when i had
hired them he was mixed up in the gun-
running all right

  a group of blacks bundled up their loot
and formed a line on either side of us
they yelled at us in a dialect that struck
my ear as similiar to that of the intotela
of tanganyika but i couldnt catch the
words however they made their meaning
plain enough when they prodded us into
motion with the points of their spears

  i felt sorry for hurst as we trudged
along the narrow foot-path toward the vil-
lage he wras in the lead and i was about
twice his size the result was that he had
the weight of the slanting pole sitting on
the back of his neck he staggered on with-
out a whimper even flung back a joke or
two at me just a little guy with more guts
than a million i could have blamed him
for fooling me into the mess we were in
but im glad i found the fortitude to put
up with the chafing of that damned pole
and to keep my mouth shut

  it was still dark when we reached the

the juju	

village which-thank god-was no great
distance from where we had camped we
got free of the pole and were pushed into
a lousy hut that stank like a sewer

  lord gasped hurst as he flung him-
self down on the dirt floor imagine trek-
king for a thousand miles with that damned
contraption around your neck slave wom-
en did it

  the weight was more evenly distrib-
uted said i

  by george i never thought of that
said he as if relieved to know that his pow-
ers of endurance lost nothing in compari-
son with that of a negress

  it struck me then that i was a lot older
than hurst in a sense a cynic he called
himself but actually he was just an enthu-
siastic boy enjoying an adventure i won-
dered if he knew how it was likely to end
for my part i couldnt see any permanent
spot for us in the shape of future events
but i didnt tell him what i thought i fig-
ured hed find out for himself soon enough
besides i was too tired to talk in spite of
the vermin and stench i curled up and
went to sleep

i awoke with the rumble of drums in
my ears hurst was already awake and
on his hands and knees peering out into the
sunlight through the hole-like entrance to
our hut he pulled his head in as i touched
his shoulders

  lot of fuss going on out there he
commented something to do with us i
suppose

  i dont doubt it i said with a wry
smile

  they came for us before i could answer
him we were taken out closely guarded
but unbound into sunlight and clamor

  it was a large village the huts with
thatches that reached to the ground squat-
ted around a central compound the ju-ju
tree a gnarled old cotton-wood stood in
the centre ringed about by stakes each
supporting a skull two of them human
the village drum stood under a thatched
gate-way near it there was a huge slab
of stone roughly carved to represent a
crocodile standing on its tail the whole
population was crowded into the compound
and they were in a high state of excite-
ment  but on the surface at least there was
 sign of hostility toward us which heart-
	jungle

ened me a little

  the drums began to roll two long lines
of women began to dance weaving to and
fro and clapping their hands then the
warriors began to pound the ground with
the butts of their spears and soon they
started an interminable chant as we
watched the lascivious wiggling of the
women the words of the chant seemed to
strum on a chord of my memory as the
chorus was repeated again and again the
words began to make sense and i listened
with my mouth open

  ha memdoma they sang

 ha memdoma

  he has finished killing muta

  he has gone to kill the island people
  and i must follow memdoma

the song was in honor of the ger-
man bengel the fellow wed chased
half way across africa it was the intotela
dialect a little of which id picked up in
german east africa then the whole thing
burst on me it struck me with the force
of a blow and i uttered an exclamation

  hurst caught my arm whats the mat-
ter with you buckland he demanded
you look as if youd seen a ghost

i am-i mean im hearing one i
said excitedly i know where your rifles
came from-i know whos selling them
what the devil he broke off staring
at me

  sure i explained more calmly its
memdoma the glass eye he got away
with a caravan of arms and ammunition
dyou mean colonel bengel

  thats the man

 but-but he- he stammered in-
credulously

  fie vanished with a caravan i cut in
thats all you or anybody else knows
but i say these fellows are intotelas part
of the caravan

  by george it could bel he cried out
either he or some one else got the cara-
van and cached the rifles-

  the conch bellowed out its double note
again every time wed heard it so far it
had meant trouble and i looked around
uneasily the blacks in front of us parted
a white robed figure emerged from a large
hut at the far end of the compound fol-
lowed by several men and women evi-

stories

dently attendants

  ha memdoma sang the warriors

  my eyes were glued on the central fig-
ure slowly advancing down the aisle of
sweating figures i think i wras expecting
to see a man in neat uniform wearing a
monocle it was with a distinct shock that
i realized that i was looking at a woman
and an uncommonly good-looking one
even at that distance she came to stand
a few feet from us and looked us over
calmly she wore a piece of cloth passed
under her right arm and knotted over her
left shoulder a beaded belt bound it to
her waist which i could have spanned with
two hands there was enough black in her
to put a shadow on her skin but her hair
fell to her waist and her eyes were crescent
shaped vaguely oriental around her slen-
der ankles and wrists were strings of blue
beads and the whole length of her left arm
almost from shoulder to wrist was orna-
mented scars about the size of a wafer
an attendant placed a stool before her
another opened an umbrella one of the big
green variety a popular article of trade
she sat down under it

  hurst coughed dryly if thats mem-
doma he whispered t can see why you
chased it

  shes just one of those things profes-
sor i retorted an imponderable-

  why have you come to amatupa white
men the girl demanded suddenly in si-
bilant portuguese

  we hadnt worked out an answer for
that and i looked at hurst helplessly his
wits were sharper than mine evidently
hed decided to gamble on what id told
him of memdoma for he started to talk
in fluent german i couldnt understand
what he was saying but the girl did her
expression changed from open disbelief to
puzzlement she asked questions hurst
answered glibly the native name mem-
doma was mentioned several times

  at last the girl seemed satisfied she
rose and signified that we were to follow
her hurst took off his big helmet wiped
sweat from his face and grinned at me

  wthat did you tell her i asked in a
whisper as we followed the girl toward
the larger hut from which she had come

  you were right buckland he an-
swered with his boyish chuckle now lis-

play we are going to see your old play-
fellow just keep your mouth shut

b

y this time we had reached the
hut the thatch had been cut away
and raised by stakes forming a sort of
veranda and the round holes in the circu-
lar daube wall had been enlarged into a
square doorway we followed the girl in

  a shaft of sunlight striking downward
through the smoke vent in the roof made
a pool of light on the mud floor the in-
terior was furnished with skilfully woven
tables and chairs of rattan there was a
ragged tri-color of bunting hanging above
a skin couch-what was left of a german
flag as my eyes grew accustomed to the
dim light they came to rest on the white
man that reclined on the couch

  he was the skeleton of a man with knot-
ted fingers and sunken chest a body wasted
by fever and dysentery a man that might
live for a day or a month only his eyes
were alive they looked enormous in their
shriveled sockets and glowed like emeralds
set in a skull

  the girl bent over him and spoke softly
then withdrew he lifted a bony finger
pointing at hurst and beckoning him to ap-
proach his couch hurst spoke rapidly
memdoma-for i knew that wreck of a
man could be no other-listened with his
unblinking eyes fixed on the speakers face
suddenly he interrupted hurst with a
harsh exclamation then pointed at me and
said something to the girl his voice
sounded like dry leaves crumpled under-
foot the girl touched my arm pointing
to the door i followed her out

  return to your hut she directed

  i stood looking down at her and i suppose
she saw approval in my eyes for she smiled
and asked suddenly

  who are your people why did you
come 

  the fame of your beauty has spread far
lady said i with a grin i came to see
for myself now i see that no man has lied

  you lie she retorted with a laugh
but pleasantly unless she added as if
struck by a sudden thought the senhor
barahona has spoken of me

   truly he has i lied glibly his words
are honey when he speaks of you lady

  the effect was the reverse of my expec-
tation her eyes flashed

  his words are poison said she with
astonishing vigor better for you if you
did not know him stranger

  she went into the hut leaving me to
regret that i had forgotten hursts admoni-
tion and opened my fools mouth evident-
ly barahonas name was no recommenda-
tion in amatupa i started to walk back to
our hut wondering if id knocked the props
frotn under hursts flimsy story

the villagers were still dancing
under the ju-ju tree and the compound
was full of dust and clamor two big in-
totelas detached themselves from the crowd
and followed me at some distance as i
circled around a group that stood watching
the dancers a native bent double under a
bundle of firewood jarred into me i
grabbed at his load to prevent him from
toppling over

  i will come tonight bwana kulas
voice came from under the bundle i threw
a quick glance over my shoulder and saw
the intotela guards bearing down

  keep going i hissed at kula and he
staggered on the two intotelas escorted
me to the hut and squatted down in the
shade of the thatch near the opening goats
milk cassava and a calabash full of an un-
palatable mixture of grain and putrid meat
had been placed on the floor but the milk
after id skimmed a handful of bugs from
the surface was sweet i was hungry
enough to tackle the mess in the calabash
before hurst showed up

  well whos the girl i asked as he
came in

  he gave me an amused look i suppose
thats natural at your age said he well
shes one of the many children born to
memdoma by native women brought her
with him from german east africa

  theres not that much black in her
said i

  who said there was german father
indian mother make what you like of it
her name is mahara does that satisfy
you

  oh sure i agreed just natural curi-
osity did he mention barahona

  he gave me a sharp look he did but

stories

what makes you ask 

  i told him

  well you dont need to wory he com-
mented when i had finished it wont
make any difference for us hes mad
buckland stark raving mad disease has
affected his brain i suppose he still thinks
hes fighting us when i told him the war
was over and germany had lost he flew
into a rage and had me kicked out it was
downright pathetic to hear him talk of the
campaign he is going to wage to recover
all german territory in africa

  but surely the others - i began
no he interrupted all they know of
the outside comes through barahona our
friend makes a trip up here occasionally
for obvious reasons he has said nothing to
disturb memdomas illusions on the con-
trary hes been filling him up with stories
of german victories

  the reasons were not so obvious for me
and i said so

  its simple enough buckland he ex-
plained as i told you we know that
barahona has been shipping out gold-dust
in greater quantities than could be acquired
by the usual practice of the company agents
we also knew that he had acted as an
under-cover man for the germans during
the war somehow through the same under-
ground channels he used during the war
probably he got to know what had hap-
pened to memdoma as you guessed mem-
doma ended his retreat out of german east
here at amatupa now those rifles traded
for gold-dust and ivory are worth a fort-
une barahona saw that but he couldnt
do anything about it not while memdoma
lived

  sure i agreed the intetola would
have killed him if hed lifted a finger
against their hero memdoma

  exactly all barahona could do was to
persuade him to sell a few of the rifles to
pay for his services and to buy supplies
for the campaign that poor devil thinks
hes going to wage

  barahona is just waiting for memdoma
to die then hes going to take over the lot
said i

  youve got it buckland and my guess
is that barahona will follow us here

  i nodded thoughtfully it was obvious
that he had sent his men along just to make
sure that we did not get beyond amatupa
blood for the juju	

  the girl must have talked to our fel-
lows i reasoned she knows what we
are after but theres something between
her and barahona i could have told him
what it was but i didnt think he would be
interested

  memdoma will hold us till barahona
comes in said he weve got to get out
of here before that happens buckland

  i told him of my meeting with kula

  do you think hell show up  he asked

  i gave him a confident grin i know
kula just sit down and wait until its dark

we were not given that long
just before sunset the village drum
used only to beat an alarm or on ceremonial
occasions boomed out an answer to one we
couldnt hear at first then it came faintly
from a distance a couple of hours later
barahona marched in with a string of swa-
hilis behind him all armed with muskets
the leading men of the intotela had gath-
ered in the compound to receive him as
we watched from the door of our hut they
formed in a semi-circle under the ju-ju
tree with barahona and his men in the
centre i guessed that there was to be a
big palavar and that our fate was the topic
under discussion

  it looks ugly commented hurst

  i was watching barahona he was talk-
ing emphasizing his words with rapid ges-
tures right then i would have given ten
years of my life to know what he was tell-
ing them i could see that he was working
them up to do something presently the
witch doctors in hideous masks and grass
cloaks that covered them from head to foot
began their capers in the centre of the gath-
ering they kept up their macabre antics
for some time then suddenly one of them
snatched a spear from one of the warriors
and flung it in the direction of our hut
i knew what that meant we had been smelt
out

  this is it hurst i shouted and pulled
his head back into the hut in a moment the
warriors had followed the spear and came
howling like a wolf-pack to drag us out
i let the first one that thrust his head
through the low opening have my boot full
in the face his body blocked the narrow
opening and gave me time to grasp his
spear for a while i held them at bay
then i heard them tearing holes in the

thatch they dropped on us from the roof
ju-jutsu must have been part of hursts
training whenever he got his hands on one
of them the fellow screamed as a bone
snapped he stayed on his feet as long as
i did it was hopeless of course in a mat-
ter of minutes we were flung to the ground
and dragged out

  i thought the ju-ju tree was the end of
the trek for us i was wrong they brought
out the yoke and yoked us up again i
could hear hurst swearing softly and flu-
ently above the excited yapping of the vil-
lagers barahona was standing with his
hands on his hips watching us with a sar-
donic grin on his face then i saw mahara
she was seated among the elders her chin
was cupped in her hand and her gaze was
fixed steadily on me as our eyes met she
moved her hands in a swift gesture before
it came to rest in her lap for an instant it
was extended toward me palm upwards
my pulse quickened with a thrill of hope
it was the conventional native gesture sig-
nifying peace she had declared herself a
friend as surely as if she had spoken the
wrords

  i lost sight of her as intotela warriors
formed a guard around us barahona
pressed his way through them and came to
stand before hurst his puffy eyes gloating

  senhor he said by this time you
must know that when you came to ngo-
mano and told me you were an archaeolo-
gist looking for a temple that you told it
to the wrong man

  i dont think so replied hurst cooly
when i told it to my friend mr buck-
land i told it to the wrong man

  barahona looked puzzled then he
laughed under the circumstances i find
it hard to follow you senhor

  permit me to explain hurst mur-
mured when my employers-

  the german government eh bara-
hona interposed with a laugh

  i refer to the companhia do nyassa and
other interested parties senhor replied
hurst as i was saying when my em-
ployers handed this case over to me i
studied all the relevant facts and drew up
my plan of action as i saw it there were
only two possible culprits mr buckland
and yourself i thought that much time
would be saved by getting in touch with
both of you by showing you my map and

stories

telling you the object of my search why
well senhor because the guilty man was
a clever fellow i knew he would not be
deceived and that sooner or later he would
reveal himself by trying to prevent me from
reaching my objective oh i see that you
are beginning to understand

barahona was plainly worried he
was staring at hurst with his loose
mouth hanging open recovering himself
he twisted his face into a grimace

  very well senhor said he you know
me but what good does that do you now 
you see how angry these people are i have
told them that you have put a spell upon
their beloved memdoma they believe he
is dying because of the evil you brought to
this place senhor i would not be in your
place for all the ivory in africa i do not
see what you have gained

  naturally hurst answered imperturb-
ably i omitted to mention that one of my
assistants wras detailed to watch your move-
ments his orders were to follow as soon
as you left ngomano with soldiers from
fort louis filippe you follow me the
soldiers follow you it is as simple as that
senhor

  soldiers barahonas face worked his
hand flew to his gun and i thought he was
going to shoot us on the spot he changed
his mind strode up to hurst and struck
him full in the face the pole prevented
hurst from falling over backwards but
he sank to his knees barahona stood over
him raving

  you lie he roared dragging hurst to
his feet a trick but you cannot fool me
by the saints you are both dead men
even soldiers will not save you he
shouted at the intotelas and they prodded
us into motion we left the village sur-
rounded by grim-faced warriors and with
the shrill curses of the women ringing in
our ears the witch doctors leaped and
shrieked in the van like fiends out of hell
we crossed the river over stones green and
slippery with weeds and stretched out into
a long file along a jungle path

  at midnight we halted for an hour or
more barahona came back from the head
of the line with the intotela headmen they
stood in a group arguing from the few
words i caught i got the impression that
barahona was trying to delay the march
blood for the juju



they met his proposals with vigorous head-
shaking and angry exclamations he came
over to us and stood frowning down at
hurst

  you have yourself to blame for this
he said

  theyll get the truth from the intotela
and theyll hang you for it barahona
hurst answered cooly you bad better
think it over

  barahona spat cursed him and hurried
away as the order to march was given
we struggled on

  as the sun came up we followed a spruit
into a narrow ravine the light was sharp
and brought out harshly the chalk-rock cliff
that rose from one hundred to three hun-
dred feet on either hand suddenly hurst
stopped as if something had struck him
and the butt end of the yoke jolted up
against my chin nearly knocking me out

  look buckland he shouted back at
me the temple

there it was sure enough it
looked as old as the cliffs themselves-
in fact it was part of them carved out of
the living rock it had two stories with
columns but was so dwarfed by its massive
background that it looked like a toy ero-
sian had softened its carvings so that it
seemed to blend into the pastel shades of
the sandstone a pile of stone blocks evi-
dently what was left of a great stairway
spilled out of a black square hole that was
the entrance as we drew nearer to it i
saw a great black slab of stone set up like
an altar about fifty yards from the entrance

  facing the altar but at some distance
from it the column of warriors was halted
the witch-doctors and the headmen gath-
ered in a group apart then the drums be-
gan to throb and the warriors rushed
forward to form a semi-circle before the
altar all scrambling to get into the front
rank barahona i noticed with his swa-
hilis clustered around him had taken up
a position on the right horn of the semi-
circle i noticed also that the swahilis had
been disarmed

  presently we were led into the centre of
the circle our hands and feet were bound
the pole taken from our necks then we
were lifted bodily and carried forward
while a great shout went up from the in-
totela and the drums rolled like thunder

  hurst was to be the first victim they
laid him on the black surface of the stone
leaving me to stand at his feet

  without warning the drums ceased all
but two of the witch doctors retired effac-
ing themselves in the crowd of the two
remaining one stood by me the other stood
over hurst he took off his mask revealing
a face withered and old then he began to
chant contorting his body and muscles
until his eyes bulged and his lips were
flecked with foam fascinated i watched
him work himself up while the resemblance
of man slipped from him like a cloak and
he became the personification of bestial
rage he had snatched a long curved knife
from under his grass cloak and was holding
it aloft with both hands for every one to
see when the report of a rifle rang out he
fell across hurst on his face and still un-
able to believe my eyes and ears i saw
blood ooze from a hole in the back of his
skull as i turned my head to look in the
direction of the temple a figure came dash-
ing toward me it was kula in the same
moment that i saw him a rifle flashed
among the pile of hewn stones i heard
the bullet plop into the black beside me
then kula was slashing at my bonds

  run bwana he panted run for the
stone house

i pounced on the witch-doctors knife
and cut the bonds from hursts legs
while kula freed his hands shrieks of
anger and dismay punctuated by the sharp
crack of the rifle filled the canyon as the
intotela over the first shock of surprise
grasped what was happening we raced for
the door of the temple as we clambered
over the heap of stones mahara jumped up
from among them i took the rifle from her
and told her to follow the others

  when we reached the temple even at
that moment i was impressed by its mag-
nificent proportions and the amount of
labor that must have gone into its construc-
tion

  father jerome wasnt lying said
hurst enthusiastically i think its dravi-
dian

  i looked at him and grinned he seemed
to have forgotten that he had just missed
getting his throat cut i thrust the rifle
into his hands

  thats not dravidian i said dryly

stories

its whats you came after-a mauser
he examined it quickly then turned to
mahara and questioned her in rapid ger-
man

  and i wasnt wrong he said with
evident self-satisfaction after she had an-
swered him rifles and ammunition are
cached inside buckland

  we went into the temple the sun was
high and a pace beyond the threshold it was
as black as night bats struck against our
faces like soft velvet as we entered and bat
guano lay inches thick on the rock floor
the stench was appaling

  there is one chamber the mahara ex-
plained but there are caves behind the
stone image of the god the guns are
stacked there four in a case

  where do the caves lead to i asked
she shook her head and reading my
thought answered there is no escape
that way 

  if the intotela attack we should be able
to hold them off until bates my assistant
gets here hurst cut in

  you-you mean you werent bluffing
barahona i gasped

  of course not said he crisply my
orders were to find this cache and destroy
it ive never failed in a mission yet and
i made sure that no matter what happened
to me i would not fail in this one

leaving kula to guard the

door we went back into the cave i
dont know how many rifles were there
the flickering light of a match showed tiers
of cases piled on a wooden platform to keep
the damp from them we broke out a couple
of rifles i saw that wed have to take them
apart and get the grease out of them we
went back to the doorway where it was
less painful to breath it didnt take us long
to clean the rifles but hurst and i were
forced to sacrifice our shirts while we
worked kula told his tale when bwana
hurst had shot the snake he said some
of the blood had spattered his legs an evil
thing the blood of a cobra a mans legs
would shrivel up if it dried upon them
therefore he had gone down to the river
to wash it off he had heard a shot and had
run back to the camp saw what was hap-
pening and hid himself later he had fol-
lowed us to amatupa shortly after i had
left him two intotela had caught him try-
blood for the juju



ing- to leave the village

  it is easy for a man to get into a village
under a bundle of firewood he concluded
but only a fool would carry wood out of
a village i did not think of that so i was
caught and taken before the chiefteness
who sits beside you it was a good thing
bwana oh yes it was she who showed me
the way here we travelled all night and
swiftly much swifter than you we were
here before the sky turned red

  i turned to the girl why did you do
this mahara

  she returned my gaze steadily because
my father memdoma will die before sun-
set he promised me to the senhor bara-
hona but i would not go with him nor
would my father force me but when he is
dead- she broke off frowning

  what then i prompted

  my father has told the intotela that
jvhen he dies barahona will be chief in his
place he will take what he wants

  what made you think we could help
you asked hurst with a puzzled frown

  she laughed softly you are his ene-
mies if your friends come as i think they
will will they not seize him  is it not pos-
sible that they or you will kill him

  of course exclaimed hurst with an
appreciative gleam in his eye and you are
on the right side of the fence what an
amazing creature buckland

  i thought so too

  the conch sounded its double note we
jumped to our feet and crowded into the
doorway the intotela had taken cover
among the rocks and the headmen had re-
tired to the opposite side of the spruit and
were grouped on a rocky kopje about five
hundred yards distant

the conch bellowed again

it was impossible to localize it the
high cliffs threw it back and forth in be-
wildering echoes then the intotela war-
riors made a dash forward dodging from
rock to rock the reports of our rifles sent
the echoes rippling up and down the can-
yon the intotela scampered back to cover
like rabbits-all but three of them who lay
where they had fallen i smiled grimly at
hurst the intotela were going to find the
going tough hurst i knew was a crack
shot and id seen what mahara could do
with a rifle as for kula if a dozen in-

totela had stood in a group and not too
far away it was just possible he would
hit one

  we waited tensely for the next rush
presently a head bobbed up from behind a
rock he was a very dead man before you
could count six he must have been the
intotela induna for suddenly they broke
cover and raced away in panic giving
tongue to those long wailing cries which
natives utter when they are frightened out
of their wits we could have dropped a
dozen of them before the range became too
long but mahara begged us not to shoot
unless attacked

  they would not have harmed you she
pleaded if barahona and the witch-doc-
tors had not turned them against you

  dyou think they mean to attack
hurst asked

  not if barahona can persuade them to
sit and wait thats all he needs to do
i explained

  he cant risk waiting too long buck-
land

an hour passed silence came to
the intotela camp and we settled
down to watch for the rest of the night
as dawn broke the boom of the drum at
amatupa came faintly to our ears i looked
at mahara inquiringly she was listening
intently as the notes of the drum faded
she smiled at me

  the soldiers have come she an-
nounced they are a days march from
amatupa

  hurst gave out a whoop of joy i didnt
believe it until i saw the intotela break
camp and start back up the canyon at a
dog trot

  well i exclaimed all weve got to
worry about now is barahona and his swa-
hilis i dont see him among the intotela
i saw hursts lips tighten and his eyes
harden

  ill deal with him now he said and
started for the door i caught his arm

  he didnt shoot i warned but that
doesnt mean he hasnt a gun he wouldnt
use it he wanted the intotela to do the
job

  we passed the stone altar and were ap-
proaching the spruit before barahona
showed himself he appeared suddenly
from behind a clump of bush and stood

stories

with his hand resting on the butt of his gun
stay here hurst directed me then
he walked to within ten paces of barahona
and stopped

  barahona was the first to speak my
men have you covered senhor he said
if you attempt to interfere with me they
will shoot

i looked around nervously
but could see no sign of the swahilis

i	guessed that they had deserted barahona
and that he was about to play his last card

i	wondered what he had in mind

  hurst looked at him steadily for a few
minutes and i saw barahonas eyes flicker
nervously  then hurst spoke

  senhor manoel barahona said hurst
formally it is my duty to arrest you foi
inciting the loyal subjects-

  barahona spat an oath and pulled his
gun he was a dead man with a neat hole
between the eyes before he could pull the
trigger

  if i could have started with that buck-
land said hurst as i came up to him it
would have saved a good deal of blood shed
damn him he added with the vehemence
that comes with the sudden release of nerv-
ous tension he gave me the worst scare
of my life and the worst of it was i had
you on my conscience

  we decided to camp out that night and
time our arrival at amatupa with that of
the soldiers kula and i went out after a
buck and were lucky enough to be back
with one before noon that night the first
watch fell to me when hurst and kula
were snoring she came to sit beside me
she was silent for a moment before she
said

  when my father was well senhor he
told me of the great towns at the coast
often i have dreamed i was there

  it is a long and dangerous trek to the
coast i explained

  she gave me a side-long look and pressed
close to me so that i felt the warmth of
her body you will go the coast soon
she asked

  truly mahara i affirmed

  is there not room in your tent for one
more senhor

  well i was never one to look a gift horse
in the mouth i said and did what was
expected of me
