 gaining momentum with each fraction of a second

in our next issue

the plague of the living dead by a

hyatt verrill the author of beyond the pole
and the man who could vanish has written a
most remarkable tale which comes pretty close to
straining your credulity but at the same time you
will say to yourself over and over that there is
nothing impossible about it immortality is pos-
sible as recent researches at the rockefeller insti-
tute have indicated that is animal tissue can be
kept alive indefinitely you will be thrilled by mr

white gold pirate by merlin moore tay-
lor an absorbing detective story about a daring
criminal who baffles many authorities interested in
the mysterious disappearance of enormous quanti-
ties of platinum a scientific detective uses the
x-ray finger prints and the phonograph in a par-
ticularly interesting manner making this a most
plausible story with a true scientific aspect

hicks inventions with a kick by
henry hugh simons in which an entirely new
thing in dining tables and service is promulgated
naturally being a new invention mishaps occur
but that only adds to the fun for the reader a
very interesting idea well told

the balloon hoax by edgar allan poe

 noted instructor lecturer and au-
 thor formerly treasurer ameri-
 ican chemical society and a prac-
 tical chemist with many well known
 achievements to his credit not
 only has dr sloane taught chemis-
 try for years but he was for many
 years engaged in commercial
 chemistry work

and you can make yourself
independent for life by un-
earthing one of chemistrys
yet undiscovered secrets

 do you remember how the tales of pirate gold used to fire
 your imagination and make you want to sail the uncharted
 seas in search of treasure and adventure and then you
 would regret that such things were no longer done but that
 is a mistake they are done-today and everyday-not on
 desert islands but in the chemical laboratories throughout
 your own country quietly systematically the chemist works
 his work is difficult but more adventurous than the blood-
 curdling deeds of the spanish main instead of meeting an
 early and violent death on some forgotten shore he gathers
 wealth and honor through his invaluable contributions to hu-
 manity alfred nobel the swedish chemist who invented
 dynamite made so many millions that the income alone from
 his bequests provides five  prizes every year for the
 advancement of science and peace c m hall the chemist
 who discovered how to manufacture aluminum made millions
 through this discovery f g cottrell who devised a valu-
 able process for recovering the waste from flue gases james
 gayley who showed how to save enormous losses in steel
 manufacture l h baekeland who invented bakelite-these
 are only a few of the men to whom fortunes have come
 through their chemical achievements

now is the time to
study chemistry

 what some of our
 students say of this
 course

    i have not written since  received the big
  set i can still say that it far exceeded my
  anticipations since i have been studying with
  your school i have been appointed chemist for
  the scranton coal co testing all the coal and
  ash by proximate analysis the lessons are
  helping me wonderfully and the interesting
  way in which they are written makes me wait
  patiently for each lesson-morlais couz-
  ens

    i wish to express my appreciation of your
  prompt reply to my letter and to the recom-
  mendation to the general electric co i in-
  tend to start the student engineering course at
  the works this is somewhat along electrical
  lines but the fact that i had a recommenda-
  tion from a reliable school no doubt had con-
  siderable influence in helping me to secure the
  job-h van benthuysen

    so far ive been more than pleased with
  your course and am still doing nicely i hope
  to be your honor graduate this year-j m
  norkus jr

    i find your course excellent and your instruc-
  tion truthfully the clearest and best assem-
  bled i have ever taken and yours is the fifth
  one ive studied-james j kelly

    from the time i was having chemistry it
  has never been thus explained to me as it is
  now i am recommending you highly to my
  friends and urging them to become members
  of such an organization-charles ben-
  jamin 

    i shall always recommend your school to my
  friends and let them know how simple your les-
  sons are-c j amdahl

    i am more than pleased you dig right in
  from the start i am going to get somewhere
  with this course i am so glad that i found
  you-a a cameron

    i use your lessons constantly as i find it
  more thorough than most text books i can
  secure-wm h tibbs

    thanking you for your lessons which i find
  not only clear and concise but wonderfully
  interesting i am-robt h traylor

    i received employment in the consolidated
  gas co i appreciate very much the good
  service of the school when a recommendation
  was asked for-jos decker

 not only are there boundless opportunities for amassing
 wealth in chemistry but the profession affords congenial
 employment at good salaries to hundreds of thousands who
 merely follow out its present applications these appli-
 cations are innumerable touching intimately every business and every product in the world the work f the
 chemist can hardly be called work at ail it is the keenest and most enjoyable kind of pleasure the days j
 in a chemical laboratory are filled with thiilling and delightful experimentation with the alluring 

 prospect of a discovery that mry spell fortune always at hand to spur your enthusiasm

         you can learn at home

 to qualify for this remarkable calling requires elaborate specialized training formerly

experimental equipment
furnished to every student

     we give to every student without additional charge this
  chemical equipment including forty-nine pieces of labora-
  tory apparatus and supplies and forty different chemicals
  and reagents these comprise the apparatus and chemicals

idle thoughts of a busy editor

                       by hugo gernsback

beginning with this issue you will note a differ-
ence in paper we have gone to a great expense to
adopt this excellent paper which is much smoother
and prints very much better than our former art
paper which some correspondents felt inclined to call wrap-
ping paper of course the magazine does not bulk as much
now and we have made the change only because so many
people wrote us saying that they did not like the paper
a vote-taking among some  people brought out this sur-
prising result-over  were in favor of the new paper of
course this new paper costs us a lot more but we want first
of all to please you

  

  the above is the style in which this sort of thing is usually
dished-up by an up-to-date editor but the plain and un-
varnished truth is that the new paper costs less money than
the old you probably would not believe this and class it as
an amazing story nevertheless it does cost us less when
we originally brought out amazing stories we thought it
necessary to hand you a big package for the money hence
the bulky paper which was made specially for our require-
ments such a paper had never been made before now it is
known as amazing stories bulky weave we are sorry to
discontinue it because we personally liked it but we know
you will like the new paper and that after all is what
counts

	 

  as a correspondent remarked to us the editor of amazing
stories does not lie on a bed of roses quite the contrary
the bed is full of thorns and if there are roses present i do
not give a scent for them

  it is the most difficult paper that it has been my good luck
to edit the strange fact is that there are no two read-
ers who like the same thing it is astonishing that the
voting coupons show that almost exactly  per cent of the
readers heartily dislike one story whereas the other  per
cent laud the same story to the skies stories like station
x the second deluge the first men in the moon
the red dust all were in this class a great many read-
ers wrote very complimentary remarks on these stories and
voted their preference for them and almost exactly the same
number of readers denounced the same stories

  if you dear reader were the editor what would your reac-
tion be to such a condition would you hesitate about the
next story before publishing it or would you simply throw
yourself to the fishes and simultaneously throw up the
sponge

  i do neither i simply keep right on smiling because i
seem to have an idea in the back of my head which during

more lucid moments probably runs somewhat as follows

  here we have amazing stories a totally new sort of
magazine different from any that has ever been published
anywhere so far it is in other words a pioneer job no
one ever having published such a magazine there is no pre-
cedent having made scientifiction a hobby since i was 
years old i probably know as much about it as any one and
in the long run experience will teach just what type of story
is acclaimed by the vast majority give the readers the very
best type of stories that you can get hold of try out the
best classics first and get the readers reactions when the
magazine has been published for a year you will have a
pretty good idea what sort of story makes the greatest ap-
peal

  in the meanwhile you are sailing uncharted seas and as
such you are apt to strike rocks once in a while but if the
navigating is done skillfully the magazine must keep afloat

  the above is very likely what is happening evidently we
are not making a mess of it because we are printing 
copies at the present time and the sales seem to be climbing
month after month it is a healthy sign and shows that
there is room for the scientifiction type of magazine

  

  may we ask you particularly this month to fill in the vot-
ing coupon you will notice it has been changed somewhat
several questions as to the illustrations have been included
and we should like to have your reactions in connection with
these questions the majority as usual will win

	 

  the  prize contest announced in our december issue
closed just as we were going to press it has been a most as-
tonishing success and far surpassed our greatest expectations
both the quality and quantity were most gratifying we re-
ceived no less than  manuscripts from all parts of the
world of course it was impossible as yet to read all of
them the majority however have been quite good and an
astonishing amount of ingenuity was shown we shall be-
gin publishing some of the prize winners in an early issue

  while the growth of amazing stories has so far pro-
gressed at a fairly satisfactory rate we are far from satisfied
more readers are what we want as you noticed we re-
cently put on an advertising section and added the discus-
sions department this by the way has been widely ac-
claimed and is eagerly read by most of our readers now
if each one of our readers would call the attention of a
friend to amazing stories we should soon be in a position
to add  per cent more text to the magazine it is our aim
to get out a book with at least  pages during the coming
year if you want it-boost amazing stories

transcribed from the field notes of james b standifer secretary delong geographical expedition to
the rio infiernillo peru with introductory note by j b s

  secretarys note

rhis strange not to say sinister record of the
delong geographical expedition to the de-
partment of ayacucho peru is here given to the
public in order that a wider circidation of the facts
herein set forth may lead to some solution of the
enigmas with which this narrative is laden

   these field notes have been privately circulated
among the members of the delong geographical
society and the addenda to this account written
by our president hilbert h delong have proved
highly gratifying to the writer no doubt this
effort at publicity will bring forward another and
equally interesting hypothesis

  it is hardly necessary to warn readers who de-
vote themselves exclusively to fiction that this rec-
ord is not for them

   fiction deals in probabilities geographical so-
cieties unfortunately are confined to facts fic-
tion is a record of imaginary events ivhich never-
theless adheres to and explains human experience
facts continually step outside of experience and
offer riddles and monstrosities

   thus in a way fiction is much truer than fact
fiction is generalized truth it is an international

legal tender accredited everywhere fact is a very
special truth ivhich passes current only with the
most discerning-or with none

  therefore the writer wishes heartily to com-
mend the great american scramble after fiction
it shows our enlightened public wishes to get at
the real universal truths of life without wasting
precious moments on such improbabilities as sci-
ence history archeology biography invention and
exploration

  to the last of this censored list these field notes
unfortunately belong

  in conclusion the writer wishes to admit that he
favors the incan theory in explaining this narrative
and the reader is warned that this prejudice may
color these notes however it has not been the
writers intention to do violencev through any
twisting of fact to the bolshevik theory of prof
demetrius z demetriovich the rumanian attache
to the expedition or to the jovian hypothesis of our
esteemed president the hon gilbert h delong

transcriber s note

rhe writer met the delong geographical ex-
pedition at colon in june  on its way
to new york his curiosity was strongly aroused
by the fact that every member of the party even to
the twenty-four-year-old secretary of the expedi-
tion seemed to be suffering from some nervous
complaint in the nature of shell shock

  at that time the writer was correspondent for
the associated press and he naturally saw a story

in the returning scientists
persuasion he obtained
mr standifers field notes
and photographs the
photographs were prac-
tically worthless on ac-
count of the deterioration
of the films and a sin-
gle glance through the
notes showed him that
they were not practicable
a p material after
much consideration and

                            after some effort and

 tv any one were to ask us for a perfect example of the
 scientifiction story ive zvould perhaps unhesitatingly
 say the green splotches here is a story that mixes
 science with fiction to the nth degree it is a story that
 will persist in your memory for many years you can
 never forget it then also you will get more out of it
 by reading it a second and third time than you did the
 first time with each reading the story will improve
 and it ivill give you more food for thought here then
 is the scientifictionm story par excellence and we know
 in advance that when you fill in your voting coupon this
 story will rank first

many discussions ivith 

mr standifer the writer 
decided that the only possible form in which these
strange memoranda could be placed before the pub-
lic was in the guise of fiction

   unfortunately this disguise is neither deep nor
cleverly done the crude outline of the actual oc-
currences destroys all approach to plot many of
the incidents are irrelevant but the only condition
upon which mr standifer woidd agree to this pub-

lication at all was that the record be given in ex-
tenso for the benefit he stated of future and
more studious generations

  in fact throughout the writers association with
him mr standifer seemed of a sour not to say
misanthropic disposition his sarcasm ivhich he
hurls at the american fiction-reading public in his
prefatory note is based entirely the writer be-
lieves on the fact that standifer tvrote a book of
travel called reindeer in iceland which he pub-
lished at his own expense
and which entirely failed
to sell that no doubt is
enough to acidulate the
sweetest disposition but
in a way it goes to prove
that standifers notes on
the peruvian expedition
are a painstaking and lit-
eral setting forth of gen-
uine experiences for a
perusal of his book en-
titled reindeer in ice-

-- land which the writer

purchased from mr standifer for fifty-four cents
shows its author has absolutely no imagination
whatever

  it is hardly worth while to add that the explan-
atory note appended to this narrative by that dis-
tinguished scholar and author the right honor-
able gilbert h delong has not been touched by
this pen-t s sept  


amazing stories

ignacio ramada prefect of
partment of ayacucho tapped his
ps under his mustache to discour-
n overpowering yawn it was mid
 high noon he had been routed
out of profound slumber by his cholo-boy-and
presented with a long impressive document with a
red seal now he stood in the salle des armes of
the governors mansion holding in his hand the
letter of introduction from the presidente of the
lima sociedad de geografico very much impressed
even amid his sleepiness by the red seal of the
sociedad and by the creaking new equipment of his
callers

  how senores can i assist in such a glorious
undertaking he inquired in spanish

  we need guides explained prof demetriovich
who was the linguist of the party

  where does your journey carry you cabel-
leros inquired the official crackling the parch-
ment in his hand

  to the region beyond the mantaro called the
valley of the rio infiernillo

  senor ramada came out of his sleepiness with
a sort of start

  no

  yes

  the prefect looked at his guests

  sefiores no one goes there

  pethwick the engineer smiled

  if the region were quite well known senor
ramada it would hold little attraction for a geo-
graphical exploration party

  well thats true agreed the prefect after a
moments thought but it will be quite difficult to
get a guide for that place in fact- here he swept
his visitors with a charming smile-the better a
man knows that region the farther he keeps away
from it seriously gentlemen why not explore
more hospitable locality where one can find a com-
fortable inn at night and procure relays of llamas
whenever necessary for your baggage

  pethwick smiled friendlily

  we did think of exploring the suburbs of lima
but the street service was so bad-

  do you read novels inquired standifer the
young secretary of the expedition

  why-yes admitted the prefect taken aback
i am fond of cisneros lavalle arestegui-

  the secretary pressed his lips together nodded
disdainfully and without further remark looked
away through the entrance into the diamond-like
brilliance of tropical sunshine in mountainous
regions

  the prefect stared seiior he said rather
sharply if you do not approve my literary taste-
pethwick stepped to the little spaniards side and
whispered quickly

  overlook it senor overlook it literature is a
tender point with him he has lost one hundred
and fifty-four dollars and forty-seven cents on an
unprofitable literary venture in fact he is a
young author

  he nodded confidentially at the prefect

  the official with latin delicacy nodded back and
patted pethwicks arm to show that all was again
well pethwick then said aloud

  so we shall have to try to find our own way into
the valley de rio infiernillo

  ramada looked worried presently he slapped
his hand on a mahogany sword cabinet that glowed
warmly in the subdued light of the salle

  sefiores he cried rattling the letter of intro-
duction with his left hand it shall never be said
that the prefect of the department of ayacucho did
not exert plenary powers to aid in disclosing to
the world the enormous riches of his province and
his native land

  so we may expect something inquired m
demetriovich

  i have the power to force some one to go with
you dramatically announced ramada

  whom asked standifer looking around
naturally my authority doesnt extend over
freemen conditioned the prefect

  your slaves inquired the secretary

  sir announced the prefect wherever the
peruvian banner waves freedom smiles

  what at inquired the literal secretary

  as the governor was about to take new offense
the old rumanian hastily inquired

  whom do we get senor ramada

  senores a garroting has been widely and  be-
lieve successfully advertised to take place on the
fifth of august if i may say it caballeros my
political career depends in greatmeasure on meet-
ing fully and completely the thrills offered by the
prospectuses the executions will be followed by
a bull-fight it was gentlemen if i may say it it
was to be the turning point of my political career
upon the prestige of which i meant to make my
race for the presidency of our republic

  gentlemen a time comes in the life of every
statesman when he can sacrifice his country to his
personal ambition or his personal ambition to his
country that moment has now come in the life
of gonzales pizarro ramada gentlemen i make
it gentlemen i am going to remit the extreme
penalty placed by the cortes upon a murderer and
a highwayman and permit them to go with you
gentlemen as guides into the valle de rio in-
fiernillo

  pethwick who had been smiling with immense
enjoyment at this rodomontade straightened his
face

  a murderer and a highwayman

  charming fellows assured the prefect i
often walk down to the carcel and converse with
them such chic such original ideas on the con-
fiscation of money-really very entertaining

  the expedition looked at the eulogist a moment
give us a minute to talk this over senor ra-
mada requested m demetriovich

  the prefect made the accentuated bow of a poli-
tician adding that the republic would be proud to
furnish chains and handcuffs to guarantee that her
sons did their duty in the discharge of a patriotic
function

  the three gentlemen of the delong geographical
expedition spent an anxious five minutes in debate
presently pethwick called

  senor ramada are you absolutely sure we can-
not procure guides who are less-questionable for
this journey
the green splotches



  gentlemen to be frank said the prefect who
had also been studying over the matter i doubt
very much whether either cesare ruano or pablo
pasca would be willing to accompany you under
those terms i cannot force them the law pro-
hibits any unusual or cruel infliction of the death
penalty and to send them to the valley of the rio
infiernillo would fall under that prohibition

  the four men stood meditating in the salle des
armes professor demetriovich stirred

  lets go have a talk with them he suggested

contrary to ramadas fears cesare ruano
the man-killer and pablo pasca the road-
agent proved willing to escort the party to the rio
infiernillo so on the following day the expedition
set forth with the legs of the convicts chained under
their mules bellies

  ayacucho turned out en masse to watch the de-
parture of so distinguished a cavalcade and it
might as well be admitted at once that none of the
adventurers made so brave a showing or saluted
the villagers with more graceful bows than did
cesare ruano or pablo pasca in fact they divided
the plaudits of the crowd about equally with the
prefect who kept murmuring to pethwick

  not a bad stroke sevor pethwick not a bad
stroke

  the legs of the convicts were chained naturally
to prevent any sudden leave-taking but this plan
held disadvantages when one of the llama packs
became loosened either the scientists had to bungle
the job themselves or take the leg-cuffs off their
prisoners and allow them to dismount and do it for
them this entailed endless chaining and unchain-
ing which quickly grew monotonous and at length
was abandoned after the geographers had exacted
a solemn pledge of the two cutthroats not to run
away that much of the contract the guides kept
to the letter they never did run away although
the company- lost them

  m demetriovich retained the manacles on the
horn of his saddle where he told pethwick he
hoped their jingle would have a great moral effect

  oddly enough both the convicts were entirely
innocent of the charges preferred against them
upon which they were convicted and so nearly
executed

  pablo pasca told the whole circumstance to peth-
wick he pablo did meet an old man one freez-
ing july night in a mountain pass on the road to
ayacucho they stopped and held some converse and
pablo had borrowed from him two hundred and
forty-seven sols then what did this ingrate of a
creditor do but beat his head against a tree break
an arm go before a magistrado and charge pasca
with highway robbery

  pablos black eyes flashed as he related the inci-
dent he had been amazed at such calumny which
he could not disprove the jury believed the old
wretch and sentenced pablo to the garrote

  however the one who ruled the earth knew
the truth and pasca prayed every night that he
should not have his spinal cord snapped on such an
unjust charge so the one who ruled sent this
society of fine gentlemen and scholars to fraternize
with pablo and to lift him to an exalted station

so he pablo supposed now all the neighbors saw
that his oath as strange as it sounded was true
to the last jot and title the padre in his visits to
the carcel had taught pablo a little verse which he
should never forget seest thou a man diligent
in his profession-he shall sit before kings

  cesare ruano did not go so much into detail as
did his fellow guide and friend but he told peth-
wick that the crime for which he was sentenced to
the garrote was trivial and with a shrug of his
shoulders let it go at that

  the trivial affair however had left a number
of marks on ruanos person all of which the aya-
cucho police had tabulated a copy of this table
was given m demetriovich in order that he might
advertise for cesare in case he should desert
pethwick read the inventory it ran

  cesare ruano a cholo  years reddish yellow height
  ft in weight  kilos  lbs muscular broad
  face prominent cheek-bones straight nose with wide
  nostrils very white teeth handsome scars from right
  eyebrow through the right cheek to the lobe of ear
  from left side of neck to the middle of chest bone
  horizontal scar from nipple to nipple rifle or pistol
  wound in right leg two inches above knee three buck-
  shot in back one in left buttock little toe on left foot
  missing disposition uncommunicative but of pleasant
  address and cheerful until irritated a very handy man
  note in case of arrest officers are advised to shoot
  before accosting ruano

on the first few nights the travelers found
lodgings at little mountain inns whose red-
peaked roofs of tiles were pulled down like caps
over tiny eye-like windows the tunnel-like en-
trance to such a hostelry always looked like a black
mouth squared in horror at something it saw across
the mountains

  this was much the same expression that the
proprietor and guests wore when they learned the
travelers were bound for the rio infiernillo

  pablo pasca always broke the news of their des-
tination in rather dramatic style to the gamesters
and hangers-on with which these centers of moun-
tain life were crowded

  sefiores he would harangue you see before
you a man sentenced to death but because no gar-
rote could affect his throat so hard has it become
from drinking gin the prefect decided to send him
on a journey to the rio infiernillo let us drink
to our good fortune

  this announcement usually brought roars of ap-
plause and laughter once a roisterer shouted
but your companions what caused them to be
sent

  and pablo answered with a droll gesture

  one is a murderer the rest are americans

  it made a great hit the crowd invited pablo to
share its brandy

  however after these introductions the landlord
would presently stop laughing and after some ques-
tions invariably warn the scientists against their
mad undertaking on two such occasions the
proprietor became so earnest and excited that he
begged the sefiores to walk out with him up the
mountain-side to see for themselves the terrors that
confronted them

  pethwick never forgot his first glimpse of the


amazing stories

mystery that colored his thoughts and dreams for
the remainder of his life

  the night was clear but moonless the party
climbed uncertainly in darkness up a scarp of
boulders and spurs of primitive rock the landlord
picked his way toward a clump of calisaya trees sil-
houetted against the sky the chill air was shot
with the fragrance of mountain violets the climb-
ers lent each other hands until the landlord reached
a protruding root and then everybody scrambled up

  pethwick dropped down breathless at the foot of
the tree his heart beating heavily at first he was
faintly amused at his hosts promise of a portent
but this amusement vanished presently amid the
solemnity of night and the mountains

  the very stars above him wore the strange aspect
of the southern constellations against their glim-
mer the andes heaved mighty shoulders peak be-
yond peak they stood in cold blackness made more
chill and mysterious by the pallor of snow-fields

  the whole group shivered in silence for several
minutes at last m demetriovich asked with a
shake in his spanish

  well amigo what is there to see

  wait began the landlord

  at that moment a star shot far out against the
blackness

  alla gasped the peruvian

  pethwick shivered and grinned he had brought
them up to see a shooting star

  but wait begged their host sensing the en-
gineers mirth

  almost at once from where the star seemed to
strike arose a faint glowing haze as indefinite as
the milky way it must have been miles distant
in front of it two or three massifs were outlined
and others farther away were dimly truncated
by its radiance

  the husped drew a long breath

  now there lies the rio infiernillo he chattered
it is a land from which no man returns alive i
have known many men to go senores thinking
surely there must be great treasure where so much
danger lay-and there may be senores no man
can say every man has his opinion about the
matter i will tell frankly what mine is-

  he paused evidently waiting for some one to
urge his opinion

  instead standifer spoke up

  my opinion is its a meteor and a phosphorescent
display which sometimes follows

  the landlord laughed through the darkness with
immense scorn of such a puerile opinion 

  what is yours inquired pethwick

  sefiores defined the tavern-keeper solemnly
that stream is called the rio infiernillo for a very
good reason for there every night comes the devil
to dig gold to corrupt the priests and-and of
course the protestants too he added charitably
but he can never do it senores let him dig till
he scoops down the mountains and reaches his own
country which is the source of the rio infiernillo-
he will never do it

  has any one ever seen where he has dug
asked pethwick amused again

  si senorj

  i thought you said no one ever went over there
and got back alive observed pethwick carelessly
a slight pause then the landlord explained
this man only lived a few minutes after he fell
into my door i saw him his hair was white
he was burned i heard his last words no one
else heard him

  this was uttered with such solemnity that peth-
wick never knew whether it was an account of some
weird tragedy of the mountains or whether it was
cut out of whole cloth

  that night after pethwick had gone to bed in
the upper story of the hostelry while the laughing
and drinking flowed steadily below it occurred to
him that it was odd after all that the landlord
should have led them on such a clamber to see a
shooting star and a haze--and the two phenomena
should have occurred so promptly

on the following night another landlord led
them out on the same mission and showed
them the same set of wonders his explanation was
even more fantastic than the first

  before the party retired that second night peth-
wick asked of m demetriovich

  professor what is the probability that two
meteors should perform the same evolutions in the
same quarter of the sky and apparently strike in
about the same place on two nights in succession
id thought of that problem returned the
savant yawning in fact i have set down some
tentative figures on the subject here he referred
to a little note-book it is roughly one chance in
two-million

  small observed pethwick

  that was for the stars alone for two stars to
fall in the same region each time followed by a
phosphorescence diminishes the probabiltiy to one
chance in eight trillion

  pethwick whistled softly

  in fact it was not a meteorite we saw con-
cluded the professor crawling into bed

chapter ii

pablo pasca shouted something from per-
haps a hundred yards up the trail he was
hidden from the string of toiling riders by
a fold in the precipice pethwick looked ahead and
saw two vultures launch themselves out over the
abyss one swung back down the face of the moun-
tain and passed within forty feet of the party its
feathers whistling its bald whitish head turning
for a look at the intruders and its odor momentarily
tainting the cold wind

  a moment later the engineer saw the two guides
had dismounted and their mules were snorting and
jerking on the very edge of the precipice the
men themselves were staring at something and
pasca seemed almost as panic-stricken as the ani-
mals the unquietness spread rapidly down the
string of baggage-carriers

  pethwick slid off his mount and hurried forward
slipping inside the llamas and dodging past the
uncertain heels of the mules he came out by the
side of pablo to a queer not to say gruesome sight

  in the air circled eight or ten vultures they had
been frightened from a row of skeletons which
the green splotches



evidently were articulated on wires and iron rods
and stood before the travelers in the awkward
postures such objects assume among the things
pethwick recognized the whitened frames of snake
condor sheep vicuna puma monkey and at the
end standing upright the bones of a man

  the specimens were accurately spaced around
the end of the trail for this was the last of the
road the skulls grinned fixedly at the delong
geographical expedition in the gusty wind the
arms of the man swung and beat against his thigh
bone in a grotesque travesty of mirth

  something touched pethwiok from behind he
turned with a shudder and saw standifer the
secretary of the expedition looked at the assem-
blage for a moment then drew out his note-book
and pen gave the pen a fillip to start a flow of ink
and methodically jotted down the list before him
when he had finished he glanced up inquiringly as
he rescrewed the top on his writing instrument

  dont suppose any one is moving a museum eh
pethwick

  no said the engineer studying the figures

  you dont think so surprised

  certainly not

  huh standifer drew forth his book again
makes a sort of little mystery of it doesnt it

  and he jotted down this fact

  prof demetriovich made his observation on the
probable source of the objects before them

  standifers hypothesis is not as bad as it
sounds pethwick observed the savant

  you dont mean these really belong to some
scientist cried the engineer

  i think their arrangement proves it

  the engineer looked at the professor curiously

  these skeletons are arranged in the order of
their evolutionary development

  a glafice showed this to be the case and it rather
surprised pethwick

  does that hold any significance

  m demetriovich walked over to the frame of
the puma and shook it slightly as he inspected it

  it would suggest a scientist arranged these
specimens a savage or a rustic would have been
more likely to have strung them out according to
size or else he would have mixed them higgledy-
piggledy and the probability that he would have
hit on their evolutionary order would have been
remote indeed the professor gave the pumas
bones another shake besides that this articula-
tion is very cleverly done-too cleverly for unprac-
tised hands

  but why should a scientist leave his specimens
out like this demanded the engineer in amaze-
ment

  to begin with this seems to be the end of the
trail-the shipping-point so to speak and for the
further reason that water boils at a very low tem-
perature at this altitude

  as the professors fingers had touched some par-
ticles of flesh still adhering to the pumas verte-
brae he stepped across to a little patch of snow
stooped and washed his hands in it

  his two companions stared at him

  water boiling at a low temperature-altitude-

whats that got to do with it interrogated the
engineer

  the scientist smiled

  i thought you would see that if boiling water
is too cool to clean the bones properly here are
some very trustworthy assistants above us

  m demetriovich indicated the vultures still
soaring overhead

  the secretary who had been scribbling rapidly
during the last part of this discourse now crossed
out a few lines on a former page with the remark
well there is no mystery to it after all

  but look here ecxlaimed pethwick were
scooped

  what do you mean-scooped asked the old
rumanian

  somebody has beaten us to this field there
are rival explorers in these mountains

  tut tut chided the old man you should say
my dear pethwick we have colleagues instead of
rivals i am charmed to believe they are here we
must get with them and try to be of assistance to
them

  the kindly old scientist stared away among the
great bluish peaks speculating on where his col-
leagues would be

  but look here objected standifer in alarm
there will be another secretary with that expedi-
tion grabbing all this literary material-

  lads lads reproached the old savant you
have yet to learn the opulence of nature she is
inexhaustible this party another party fifty
parties toiling at the same time could never fathom
all the marvels that lie under the sweep of our gaze
why gentlemen for instance in bucharest i and a
colleague worked for three years on the relation of
the olfactory system of eatarrhine monkeys with
that of human beings our effort was to approxi-
mate in what epoch the sense of smell became of
secondary importance to humanity this of
course would mark a great change in the mode of
living among men

  as i say we spent three years on the two nervous
systems and yet our discoveries were most dis-
similar now what are a few white nerve-threads
to all this wilderness of snow and boulders your
fears are quite baseless

his two companions laughed half ashamed of
their jealousy and then inspected the scene
before them which up till now had been lost in
the grisly detail of the skeletons

  the mountain side on which they stood dropped
away in an enormous declivity fully a mile and a
half deep and led into a vast and sinister valley
that stretched toward the northeast until its folds
and twists were lost among the flashing peaks

  the extraordinary part of the scene was that in-
stead of spreading the vivid green of the tropics
below the tree-line this great depression looked
black and burned the ensemble recalled to peth-
wick certain remarkable erosions he had seen in the
west of the united states only here the features
were slashed out with a gigantism that dwarfed our
western canyons and buttes

  and there was another striking difference in the
north american west the grand canyon and the


amazing stories

yosemite glow with a solemn beauty the chasm
looked like the raw and terrible wound of fire its
blackened and twisted acclivities might have been
the scars of some terrible torment

  a river lay through the center of this cicatrix and
although later it proved nearly half a mile wide it
was reduced to a mere rivulet amid such cyclopean
setting it twisted in and out now lost to view
now shimmering in the distance everywhere tak-
ing the color of its surroundings and looking for
the world like one of those dull spreading adders
winding through the valley

  pethwick now fully understood why the indians
had given the peculiar name to the river it was
a sobriquet any human being would have bestowed
upon it at first glimpse it required no guide to
tell pethwick he was looking down upon the rio
infiernillo

  this is the place senor said pablo pasca
  do we start back from here

  pethwick looked at him in surprise

  well spend the next sixty days in this valley
i mean cesare and myself senor explained the
zambo in hangdog fashion

  you and cesare

  we have shown you the valley of the rio in-
fiernillo-that was all we promised senor pursued
pablo doggedly

  ruano glanced around speak for yourself
pablo

  you are not going into this den of satan are
you cried pablo to the murderer past these-
these-he nodded at the skeletons

  ruano grinned showing two rows of big white
teeth ill go help make some more skeletons he
said carelessly

  pethwick began to explain away pascas fears
those are nothing but the specimens of a sci-
entific expedition pablo

  do scientific expeditions collect skeletons
shuddered the thief

  yes

  will you do that

  very probably

  and leave them for the birds to pick

  if we dont boil them pethwick grew more
amused as the fears of his guide mounted

  dios mio what for

  to study them laughed the engineer

  pablo turned a grayish yellow

  and you kill men and let the buzzards pick their
bones-to study them aspirated the half-breed
will you kill me-and ruano

  certainly not ejaculated pethwick quite
shocked what a silly idea

  but the other gang did senor cried the
zambo nodding at the skeleton of the man at the
end of the line and no doubt senor they told
their guide that all was well that everything was
as it should be until one fine day-pang

  and here he stands grinning at me slapping
his knee to see another big fool go down the scarp
at such a hideous suspicion all three scientists
began a shocked denial

  what did pablo take them for-ghouls they
were civilized men scientists professors engineers
authors

  then why did you choose for guides two men
condemned to death unless it was to kill them and
stay within the law

  they reassured the robber so earnestly that he
was half convinced when unfortunately an extra
gust of wind set the skeleton clapping his knee
again

  the gruesome mirth set pablo almost in a
frenzy

  ehue yes but how did the other party get
their man no doubt they found a dead man in
this devils country oh yes dead men are fre-
quent in this place where men never go they
didnt kill their guide to study his bones oh no
not at all ha no he dropped dead very
reasonable ho

  with a yell he dropped his mules rein and leaped
for the mouth of the trail

tut cesare ruano was quicker than the thief

    the murderer made one leap caught the flying
zambo by the shoulder and brought him in a huddle
on the stones

  the robber shrieked screamed began a chatter-
ing prayer

  oh holy mary blessed virgin receive my
soul i am to be killed blessed queen

  the words seemed to arouse some sort of anger
in cesare for the big fellow shook pablo till his
teeth rattled

  shut up squeaking you rabbit cant you tell
when a man is about to murder you these are
gentlemen you will stay with this party coward
and do the work you will help me i will not
leave them and neither will you sabe

  as he accented this sabe with a violent
shake pablos head nodded vigorously whether he
wanted it to or not

  oddly enough the trouncing seemed to reassure
pasca more than all the arguments of the scientists

  you are a shrewd man cesare he gasped as
soon as he was allowed to speak are you sure they
wont hurt us

ruano laughed again with a flash of teeth
they cant hurt me i could mash these little
men with my thumb whom are you afraid of
pablo-the old gray man who can hardly walk
why no admitted the thief looking at m
demetriovich

  or of that bean-pole boy whose head is so weak
he cannot remember the simplest thing without
writing it in a book

  nor him either agreed pablo with a glance at
standifer

  or the engineer who cannot lift a hand without
gasping for breath

  anyway argued pasca half convinced how
did those other geographers manage to kill their
guide perhaps they shot him when he was
asleep

  they were not geographers snapped ruano
at least they were not like these men

  how do you know

  could another such a party be in the mountains
and all the country not hear of it even in prison
we heard the great american scientists were going
to the rio infiernillo then take these men-would
the green splotches



they tie all these bones together if they wanted to
pack them on llamas to ayacucho you know they
would not they would take them apart and put
them in sacks until they reached america

  why thats a fact agreed pasca staring at
the skeletons with new interest certainly no
llama would carry one of these things he stared
a moment longer and added but perhaps these
other scientists were also fools and did not think of
that

  then they would not have had wit enough to
kill their guide it takes some wit to kill a man
pablo i assure you

  naturally the geographers had been listening to
this very candid opinion of their party now m
demetriovich inquired not without a certain re-
spect in his voice

  senor ruano i may be wrong in my judgment
how do you think those skeletons came here
senor returned the convict respectfully this
is the rio infiernillo i think the devil put them
here to scare men away so they cannot look into
hell while they are alive because if they had a
look senor it would be so horrible they would
change their lives become good men and go to
heaven-and so the devil would lose patronage
standifer who was chagrined with ruanos de-
scription of himself grunted out the word bar-
barous pethwick shouted with laughter

  with a blush standifer drew out his notebook as
he did so he said to cesare

  these entries are made not because i lack in-
telligence as you seem to think but because i am
the official secretary of this expedition besides i am
an author i wrote a book called reindeer in ice-
land

  a fit of coughing seized pethwick

  i meant nothing by what i said sefor standi-
fer explained ruano except to hearten this rab-
bit think nothing of it he turned to the crowd
as a whole we will never get the mules and llamas
past the skeletons so we will have to remove the
skeletons past the mules and llamas

  this plan recommended itself to the whole party
and everybody set to work the men lugged the
things past the trembling animals and finally lined
them up behind the cavalcade they placed the hu-
man frame at the head of the troop just as they
had found it

  as pethwick rode away he looked back at it
there it stood representing the summit of crea-
tion the masterpiece of life it rattled its phalanges
against its femur and grinned a long-toothed grin
at the vast joke of existence-an evolutionary
climb of a hundred-million years a day or two of
sunshine a night or two of sleep a little stirring a
little looking around and poof back it was where
it had started a hundred million years ago no
wonder skeletons grin

on the forward journey it transpired that cesare
ruano had obtained a sort of moral ascendency
over the whole party

  he certainly had set the whole crowd straight
about the skeletons they had talked for an hour
to decide where they came from and in half a dozen

words cesare proved to them they knew nothing
about the matter whatsoever

  another thing that gave cesare prestige was his
abrupt quelling of pascas desertion without
cesare the zambo would have escaped none of
the scientists would have acted in time to stop his
headlong flight

  civilization has the unfortunate effect of slow-
ing up mens mental operations in emergencies in-
deed civilization places such a premium on fore-
sight that a civilized man lacks ability to live from
instant to instant the ordinary american lives
usually in next month or next year but he is rarely
at home in the now and here

  this quality of concentration on the future is a
splendid thing for developing inventions building
great businesses painting great pictures writing
novels and philosophies but it works badly indeed
for guarding convicts who invariably bolt in the
present tense

  cesare used his new authority to possess him-
self of a rifle

  we dont know just who shot this skeleton he
explained very simply to m demetriovich and we
dont know how many more skeletons the fellow
may want i prefer to keep mine now i have ob-
served that you senores never glance about when
you travel but look straight into your mules ears
and think of a great many things no doubt but
this fellow could collect your skeletons very easily
so i will take a rifle and ride before and shoot
whoever it is before he shoots us

  ruano chose standifers rifle for this task the
secretary was glad of it for the weapon had been
chafing his leg ever since the party left ayacucho

  the immediate declivity leading into the valley
of the rio infiernillo was a field of boulders rang-
ing in size from a mans head to a house far be-
low them the tree line was marked by some small
trees that had been tortured by the wind into
grotesque shapes worked out by the japanese in
their dwarf trees here and there patches of snow
disguised their precarious footing into white pit-
falls

  the mules crept downward exploring every step
of the way with their little hoofs then easing their
weight forward it made a very swaying chafing
ride pethwicks pommel worked against his
stomach until he felt he had been sitting down a
week wrong side first

  after an endless jostle it seemed to the engineer
that he was not descending in the slightest but
was being shaken back and forth sticking in one
place amid the cyclopean scenery when he
looked back the endless boulder-field slanted to-
ward the sky when he looked down it seemed as
far as ever into the black and sinister valley where
the river wound like an adder

  he looked to reaching the tree-line with a hope it
would bring him relief from the monotony it did
not his saddle chafed his mule sagged and swayed
his fellow-scientists did as he was doing squirmed
about on the torturing saddle-horns the sameness
drove his mind in on itself he began as cesare
had said to stare into his mules ears and think

  he wondered about the skeletons he wondered
what trivial thing cesare had done to get


amazing stories

sentenced to the garrote he wondered what that
shooting star and the phosphorescent mist could
have been then he wondered about the skeletons
again    about cesare   

  a rifle-shot that sounded like a mere snap in the
thin mountain air disturbed his reflections he
looked up and saw a faint wisp of vapor float out
of the - in cesares hands the engineer
glanced anxiously to see if the murderer had shot
any of his companions they were all on their
mules and all looking at each other and at him
every one in the crowd had felt instinctively that
the desperado had fired at some person-possibly
at one of his own party

  what is it cried standifer

  a man yonder pablo pointed

  i dont know whether it was a man or not cried
ruano jumping from his slow mule and setting
off down the declivity at a hazardous run

  ruano shouted m demetriovich in horror
did you shoot at a human being like that drop
that rifle you bloodthirsty fellow drop it

  extraordinary to say cesare did drop his gun
and as it struck the stones it fired again the man
plunged on downward at full tilt it was an amaz-
ing flight he took the boulders like a goat the
party stopped their mounts and sat watching the
dash

  did you say it was a man asked the secretary
shakily of pablo

  as sure as i am sitting here at that moment
the flying ruano swung in behind a large boulder

  he was behind that cried pablo sharply then
he lifted his voice did you get him cesare he
shouted was there any money on him

  but almost immediately pethwick glimpsed the
murderer again in fact saw him twice-or he may
have caught a flash of two figures one chasing the
other

suddenly pablo began yelling sis if on a fox-
course

  a shock of horror went through pethwick he
knew too well what the convict would do if he
caught the man nobody could waylay cesare
ruano even to look at him in safety

  here lets get down there cried the engineer in
urgent tones lord we ought not to have given
that brute a gun

  maybe he hit him surmised pablo in cheerful
excitement

  hes chasing him this minute somewhere behind
those boulders declared standifer nervously

  m demetriovich dismounted and from between
two boulders recovered standifers rifle as they
passed it

  pethwick had screwed up his nerves for some
dreadful sight behind the boulder but there was
nothing there nothing except a splotch of green
liquid on the stones

  smaller gouts of this green fluid led off down the
boulder-field making from one large boulder to an-
other as if some dripping thing had tried to keep a
covert between itself and the party of riders

  pethwick dismounted and followed this trail per-
haps a hundred yards until it ceased then he
stood looking about him in the cold sunshine he

could not hear the slightest sound the blackened
valley and the infernal river lay far below him
high above him at the end of the trail the vultures
wheeled against the sky

chapter iii

rom his headlong pursuit down the moun-
tain-side cesare ruano never returned

  what became of him none of his companions
ever discovered he dropped out of their lives as
suddenly and completely as if he had dissolved into
thin air

  a dozen possibilities besieged their brains per-
haps he fell over a cliff or was drowned in the
river or he may have deserted the expedition
perhaps he was still wandering about lost or
crazed perhaps the man he pursued turned and
killed him

  all these are pure conjectures for they had not
a clue upon which to base a rational hypothesis
the only hope for a suggestion the green splotches
on the boulders proved to be a hopeless riddle itself

  the men picked up several of the smaller bould-
ers and when camp was pitched prof demetriovich
made a chemical analysis of the stain its coloring
matter was derived from chlorophyll if ruanos
shot had penetrated the stomach of some running
animal it was barely possible for such a stain to
have resulted-but it was improbable this stain
was free from cellular vegetal structure in the
mixture was no trace of the corpuscles or serum of
blood

  on the afternoon of the second day following the
incident the men sat at the dinner-table discusing
the matter

  in the tent beside the rude dining-table were cots
and another table holding mineral and floral speci-
mens and some insects two or three books were
scattered on the cots and duffle-bags jammed the
tent-corners

  looking out through the flaps of their tent the
diners could see the eastern peaks and cliffs of the
infernal valley turning orange under the sunset

  m demetriovich was talking

i consider the chlorophyll an added proof that
there is another scientific expedition in this valley

what is your reasoning inquired pethwick

  chlorophyll is a substance none but a chemist
could or rather would procure it serves no com-
mercial purpose therefore it must be used ex-
perimentally

  why would a chemist want to experiment in
this forsaken place

  standifer put in a question-

  then you think cesare shot a hole in a canister
of chlorophyll solution

  when a man has a choice of improbabilities all
he can do is to choose the least improbable ex-
plained m demetriovich friendlily

  i wonder what cesare would say about it
speculated pethwick

  the green trail also suggests my theory pro-
ceeded prof demetriovich when ruano shot the
man behind the boulder his victim evidently did
not know that his can of solution had been punc-
tured for he sat hidden for perhaps a minute while
his container leaked a large pool just behind the
the green splotches



rock then cesare charged the fellow fled losing
small quantities as the liquid splashed out at last
the man observed the puncture and turned the can
over and there the trail ended

  m demetriovich pushed his coffee cup toward
pablo without interrupting his deductions

  i should say cesares bullet entered the can
about an inch below the level of the liquid that
would explain why a continuous trail did not mark
the fugitive

  but why would one scientist be ambushing civ-
ilized men in a heaven-forsaken place like this
cried standifer in slightly supercilious tones and
why should he carry a canister of chlorophyll
around with him

  pethwick tapped the table with his fingers

  its unfair to demand the fellows occupation
race color and previous condition of servitude he
objected then after a moment i wish we could

find ruano -

  m demetriovich stirred his coffee and looked in-
to it without drinking a latin habit he had formed
in the rumanian cafes

  if i may be so bold senores put in pablo
pasca a scientist-a lone scientist would go crazy
in a place like this

  this remark while as improbable as the other
guesses nevertheless spread its suggestion of
tragedy over the situation

  nobody knows the action of chlorophyll ex-
actly brooded m demetriovich somehow it
crystalizes the energy in sunlight if some man
had developed a method to bottle the suns energy
directly he would probably pursue his investiga-
tions in the tropics -

  and he might desire secrecy added pethwick

so much so that he would even -

  you mean he would murder cesare finished
standifer

  a certain type of scientific mind might do that
gentlemen agreed demetriovich gravely

  what sort professor

  there are only a few countries in the world
capable of producing a chemist who could experi-
ment with chlorophyll and sunlight -

  the diners looked at the old scientist expectant-
ly-

  of these i know only one country whose na-
tional creed is ruthlessness only one whose chem-
ists would kill an indian on the bare possibility
that the indian might divulge his secret process-
or his political affiliations

  you mean he could be a german royalist
queried pethwick

  if the germans could synthesize the suns en-
ergy and thus transform it directly into food they
would certainly be in a position to bid again for
world dominion stated m demetriovich posi-
tively it would annul a blockade of the seas it
would render unnecessary millions of men working
in the fields and put them on the battlefront

  but thats fantastic professor cried peth-
wick thats getting outside of probability

  the green splotches themselves are outside of
probability mr pethwick stated the old savant
gravely but they are here nevertheless

  the moon is rising observed standifer cas-
ually

  the secretarys silly and trivial breaks into the
conversation irritated pethwick he turned and
said-

  well that doesnt bother me does it you

  oh no said standifer taking the rather tart
remark in good faith i like to watch the moon
rise if i may say it all my best literary ideas
are evolved under the moonlight

  trot on out and see if you cant think up some-
thing good suggested the engineer

  standifer caught this sarcasm flushed slightly
but did get up and walk out through the tent en-
trance a moment later the two men followed him
leaving the things to pablo

the rising moon centered their attention with
the first glint of its disk between two peaks far
down the valley the last bronze of twilight lin-
gered in the west the men shivered with the chill
of coming night

  despite pethwicks jibe at the poetical influence
of the moon as expressed by the secretary the en-
gineer felt it himself

  it looks whiter more silvery in this latitude
he observed after a continued silence

  that mist about it looks like the veil of a bride
mused the author

  may do it said the engineer who despised
similes but it looks more like a mist around the
moon

  whats the matter with you anyway peth-
wick snapped standifer wheeling around just
because you lack the gift of poetical expression is
no reason why you should make an ass of yourself
and bray every time i utter a well-turned phrase

  was that what you were doing inquired the
older man

 it was and if-

  standifer broke off suddenly and stared then
in amazement gasped-

  for heavens sake

  what is it both the older men followed his
gaze

  standifer was staring into the fading sky utter-
ly bewildered

  pethwick shook him

  what is it

  the secretary pointed skyward

  they followed his finger and saw against the
dull west the delicate silver crescent of a new
moon

  it required half an instant for the incoherence of
their two observations to burst upon them the
next impulse all three turned

  the full moon they had seen rising in the east
had disappeared the mist a phosphorescent mist
still hung about the peaks indeed it seemed to
settle on the distant crags and cliffs and glow
faintly in the gathering darkness it defined a sort
of spectral mountain-scape then before their as-
tounded gaze it faded into darkness

  a scratching sound caused pethwick to shiver
it was pablo striking a match inside the tent


amazing stories

after his observation of what for want of a
better name will have to be called the psuedo-
moon a curious mental apathy fell over pethwick
not that he failed to think of the extraordinary
series of events that had befallen the expedition
he did think of them all the time but he thought
weakly hopelessly he picked up the problem in
his brain without the slightest hope of finding the
solution he exhausted himself on the enigma and
yet he could not let it go

  he tried to forget it and center himself on his
work but little mysteries cropped out in his every-
day toil his principal duty with the expedition was
map-making the determination of the altitudes of
the various observed peaks and a mapping of the
outcrops of the black micas limonites serpentines
pitchblendes obsidians and hornblendes it was
these dark-colored stones he found that gave the
great chasm its look of incineration

  and this is what he did not understand here
and there he found places where streams of lava
sprang apparently out of the solid escarpment of
the cliffs

  now the whole peruvian sierras are volcanic and
these lava pockets did not surprise pethwick the
inexplicable part was that no volcanic vent con-
nected these little fumaroles with the interior of
the mountain they seemed to have burned from
the outside they looked as if some object of in-
tense heat had branded the mountain-side

  ordinarily pethwicks mind would have sprung
like a terrier at such a problem now through
sheer brain fag he jotted the descriptions without
comment in this dull soulless way he made the
following extraordinary entry in his journal one
morning

    this morning close to one of those burned pockets
   or fumaroles which i have before described i found
   a roasted rabbit the little animal was some twelve
   feet from the fumarole sitting upright on its haunches
   and roasted it looked as if its curiosity had been
   aroused and it had been cooked instantly as decom-
   position had not set in it could not have been dead
   for more than a week

    i wonder if this is a tab on the date of these fum-
   aroles if so they must have been burned a few days
   ago instead of being of geologic antiquity as i at
   first assumed if recent they must be of artificial
   origin since they roast a rabbit before frightening it
   they must occur with the abruptness of an explosion
   can these splotches be connected with the evil mystery
   surrounding this expedition i cannot say i have no
   theory whatever

that evening at dinner pethwick showed this
entry to m demetriovich the old rumanian
read it and his only comment was a nod and a
brief -

  yes i had discovered they were of recent origin
myself

  presently he suggested a game of chess to take
their minds off the matter before they retired
you look strained pethwick the old man said
the engineer laughed briefly

  i am strained im jumpy every minute of the
day and night

  the old savant considered his friend with con-
cern

  wouldnt you better get out of here foi a while
herbert

  whats the use i could think of nothing else
  you would feel out of danger

  i dont feel in danger

  yes you do-all mystery connotes danger it
suggests it to us that is why mystery is so stim-
ulating and fascinating

  do you think we are in danger

  i am sure the man who killed cesare would not
hesitate over us

  standifer who was seated at the table began to
smile in a superior manner at their fears

owing to the engineers nervous condition this
irritated pethwick acutely however he said noth-
ing about it but remarked to m demetriovich-
tomorrow i am through with my work right
around here

  then youll take a rest as i suggest

  no ill take a pack walk straight down this
valley and find out what is making these fumaroles
-and what became of cesare

  at that moment in the gathering blue of night
the eastern sky was lighted by the glare of the
pseudo-moon its pallor poured in through the
tent flaps and the shadows of the mens legs
streaked the floor

  the mystery brought both the old men to the
outside they stared at the illumination in silence
the light was as noiseless as the aurora as they
watched it pethwick heard standifer laughing in-
side the tent

  the secretarys idiocy almost snapped the en-
gineers control he wanted to knock his empty
head at last the phenomenon died away and left
its usual glimmer on the surrounding heights in
a few minutes this vanished and it was full night

  when the men reentered the tent standifer still
smiled as if he enjoyed some immunity from their
mystification and nervousness

  well whats the joke asked pethwick at last
the way you fellows go up in the air about this
thing

  you i suppose are on solid ground exploded
pethwick

  the author said nothing but continued his idiotic
smile

  i admit there are points here and there i dont
understand continued pethwick after a moment
no doubt we fail to understand it as thoroughly
as you do

  you do agreed standifer with such matter-of-
factness the engineer was really surprised

  what in the devil have you found out he asked
irritably

  oh the facts the facts said standifer non-
chalantly im a writer you know a trained ob-
server i dive to the bottom of things

  pethwick stared then laughed in a chattery
fashion-

  y-yes i see you diving to the bottom of this

  the old professor who had been studying the
secretary quietly interrupted-

  what do you know james

  the literary light hesitated a moment then drew
a handful of glittering metal out of his pocket and
plunked it down on the table
the green splotches



 i know all about it he said and grinned in spite
 of himself

 the men stared pablo pasca paused in his
 journeys to and from the kitchen tent to stare at
 the boy and the gold

 know all about what cut in pethwick jumpily
 the gold or the mystery

 both

 suddenly pablo cried-

 i told you senores wealth lies where danger is
 so great

 have you found a gold mine asked m deme-
 triovich

 no i sold one of my books

whom to-when-where-my lord who was
the sucker-pethwicks questions almost exploded
out of him

 i had no idea my book had such a reputation
 beamed the author

 youngster if youll cut the literary twaddle-

 quavered pethwick on edge

 well i had a hunch there must be some very
 simple explanation of all this skull and cross-bone
 stuff you fellows were trying to pull you know
 that doesnt go on in real life its only fiction

 that resort of the mentally muddled-

 standifer spill it-if you know anything
 go on tell it your own way encouraged deme-
 triovich you were saying mentally muddled 
 sure-yes well nothing to it you know this
 life is very simple once you get the key

 lord doesnt that sound like reindeer in ice-
 land groaned the engineer

 what was the light we saw just then mr
 standifer inquired the savant who saw that the
 secretary would never get anywhere unaided

 a new sort of portable furnace sir that ex-
 tracts and reduces ores on the spot

 who runs it

 indians

 have you seen any of them

 saw one not three hours ago sold him a copy
 of reindeer in iceland 

 pethwick interrupted the catechism

 gave you that much gold for a copy of rein-
 deer in iceland - for the whole edition of

 reindeer in iceland

 did you enquire about cesare proceeded m
 demetriovich

 yes hes working for them

 did you think to ask about the chlorophyll
 thats used in a secret process of extracting
 gold

 you say the men engaged in such a method of
 mining are indians

 the man i saw was an indian

 did you talk to him in english spanish qui-
 cha what language

 the secretary hesitated

 well-in english but i had to explain the
 language to him i think he knew it once but had
 forgotten it

 a lot of south americans are educated in the
 states observed pethwick who by now was list-
 ening intently

 tell us what happened mr standifer re-
 quested the rumanian

  t tell today i was about twelve miles down
  the valley i had sat down to eat my lunch
when i saw an indian behind a rock staring at me
as if his eyes would pop out of his head i dont
mind admitting it gave me a turn after the way
things have been happening around here on sec-
ond glance i thought it was cesare i was about to
yell and ask when the fellow himself yelled at me-
 hey cesare is that you

  well it nearly bowled me over but i got a
grip on my nerves and shouted back no im not
cesare and i was about to ask who the fellow
was when he took it right out of my mouth and
shouted to me who are you  

  i told him my name and address that i was an
author and secretary of the de long geographical
expedition then i asked him to come out and lets
have a talk

  the fellow came out all right walking up to
me looking hard at me he was an ordinary indian
with a big head and had on clothes about like
cesares in fact you know it is hard to tell indians
apart as he came up he asked me the very ques-
tion i had in mind-

   do you know cesare

  i said yes where is he

  he stood looking at me and shook his head

  i said you dont know and he touched his
mouth and laughed then i guessed that he didnt
understand english very well so i began explain-
ing the language to him

  he would point at something and say is that a
bird is that a stone is that a river in each
case he got it right but there was always a hesita-
tion of about a second perhaps as if he were
thinking like this is that a-river 

  both the older men were staring intently at the
boy as if they were trying to read something behind
his words pethwick nodded impatiently

  i am sure continued standifer the fellow once
knew english and it was coming back to him
undoubtedly from pethwick

  then he saw the corner of my book in my hav-
ersack for i-i sometimes carry my book around
to read when im lonely and he said what is that
-reindeer in iceland

  that joggled me so i said yes how the deuce
did you know that

  well at that he almost laughed himself to
death and finally he said just about what was in
my mind that has a wider reputation than you
imagine and he added what is it for

   what is what for says i

   reindeer in iceland says he

   to read says i it contains facts says i
its not like the rotten fiction you pick up and
with that my whole spiel that i used to put up to
the farmers in new york state when i sold my
books from door to door came back to me i thought
what a lark it would be to try to sell a copy to an
indian in the rio infiernillo if i do that i thought
to myself ill be the star book-agent of both the
americas so i began

   its not like the rotten fiction you buy says i
this volume gives you the truth about reindeer in
iceland it tells you their food their strength their
endurance their value in all the different moneys


amazing stories

of the world it states where are the greatest herds
what reindeer hides are used for how their meat
milk and cheese taste how to prepare puddings
from their blood how the bulls fight their calls
their love-calls danger-calls hunger-calls how
their age may be calculated by the tines on their
horns and the rings on their teeth and the set of
their tails in fact sir said i with this little
volume in your pocket it will be impossible for any
man no matter how dishonest he is to palm off on
you an old decrepit reindeer under the specious
representation that he or she is young agile and
tender

   the price of this invaluable compendium puts
it within easy reach of one and all it will prove
of enormous practical and educational value to each
and any it makes little difference whether you
mean to rear these graceful docile animals or not
you need this volume for as a means of intellectual
culture it is unsurpassed it contains facts noth-
ing but facts you need it do you want it are
you progressive its price is the only small thing
about it-only fifty-four cents let me put you
down

  with that so strong is the force of habit i
whipped out an old envelope to take his order on

   what is fifty-four cents he asked have i
got fifty-four cents

   just what i was wondering says i turn
your pockets wrongside out and ill see

  he turned em and spilled a lot of metals on the
ground i saw these pieces of gold and told him
they would do i told him i would give him all five
of my volumes for that is the number i brought
on this trip and im sorry now i didnt bring more

  he just pushed the gold over to me without
blinking an eye and we traded i told him where we
were camped and he said tomorrow he would call
and get the other four volumes and gentlemen
that is all i know

at the end of this tale standifer leaned back
smiling with pleasure at his sale the two
men sat studying him at last pethwick asked-
you say he knew the title of your book
yes

  was the title showing

  no just a little corner stuck out of the knap-
sack

  pethwick considered a moment

  you at first thought it was cesare

  yes

  did he have a scar on the side of his face

  no i would have noticed that sure still his
face was painted very thickly i couldnt see any
scar

  you are sure it wasnt cesare

  absolutely sure

  here m demetriovich took up what might be
called the cross-examination

  you say he didnt understand english at first-
could he read the book you sold him

  no that was the odd part i had to tell him
what the letters were and how they made words
how words made sentences but he caught on the
moment i showed him anything and never forgot
at all i tried him

  m demetriovich paused

  you are sure it was an indian

  yes

  but he didnt know the value of gold

  well i dont know about that began standi-
fer

  did you say he gave you all that money for five
dinky little books stormed pethwick

  yes but that doesnt say he doesnt under-
stand-

  a gold-miner interrupted m demetriovich
who is so highly scientific as to employ chloro-
phyll in a secret process of extracting gold and yet
who-doesnt know the value of gold

  the secretary caressed his glittering pile hap-
pily yawned and slipped it back into his pocket

  anyway i wish i had a cartload of those books
down here

  pethwick sat on his stool clutching his knee to
his breast glaring at the author finally he gave a
nervous laugh--

  im glad youve cleared up the mystery standi-
fer

  so am i returned the secretary genially i
was getting worried about it myself

  i shouldnt think it would worry you standi-
fer pethwick gave another shuddery laugh

  im not bad to worry agreed the secretary
heartily

  the engineer sat moistening his dry lips with
his tongue while little shivers played through him

  by the way he asked after a moment did you
think to enquire about those skeletons is that-
cleared up too

  yes i did he said he put them up there to
keep the animals away he said you never knew
what sort of animals were about and he didnt want
any in till he was ready he said he put one of
every species he could find because each animal was
afraid of its own dead

  m demetriovich sat gazing at the boy a gray-
ness seemed to be gathering over the old man

  thats a fact he nodded id never thought of
it before-each animal is afraid of its own dead
no skeleton shocks a human being except the skele-
ton of a man i suppose its true of the rest
anyway its all cleared up now standifer re-
peated the engineer with his chattering laugh it
is as you say standifer there are no mysteries out-
side of fiction

  he began laughing shaking violently his ex-
clamations grew louder and wilder m demetrio-
vich jumped out of his seat hurried over to his
medicine-chest fixed up a glass of something and
with a trembling hand presented it to the engineer
pethwick drank some and then the old man took a
deep swallow himself

  whats the matter asked the secretary lift-
ing a happy head

  its the reaction shivered the engineer less
violently you cleared up the mystery-so sud-
denly- go on to sleep

  the boy dropped back to his pillow and was off
instantly after his long walk

  the two older men sat staring at each other
across the little table their nerves calming some-
what under the influence of the sedative
the green splotches



  is it a lie whispered pethwick after long
thought to cover the discovery of gold

  m demetriovich shook his head

  that boy hasnt enough imagination to concoct
a fragment of his fantastic tale the thing hap-
pened

  then in gods name what is cesare going to do
to us tomorrow

  cesare would never have given away all that
gold decided the old savant slowly

  unless-he means to recoup it all tomorrow

  m demetriovich shook his head

  cesare might have put on the paint-he could
never have thought up such an elaborate mental
disguise that is far beyond him

  the two men brooded at last the savant hazard-
ed

  it may be possible that the bolsheviki have quit
using gold i believe there is a plan to use time-
checks down in their socialistic program

  the engineer jumped another speculation the
old incans used gold as a common metal-the old
incans-sun-worshipers who sacrifice living men to

their deity-

  the two scientists sat in silence from the ice-
fields high above the chasm of the rio infiernillo
came a great sighing wind it breathed in on them
out of the blackness its cold breath chilled their
necks their hands their wrists it breathed on their
ankles and spread up under their trousers chilling
their knees and loins

  the men shivered

chapter iv

pethwick awoke out of some sort of night-
mare about incan sun-worshipers he could
hear the groans of victims about to be sac-
rificed and even after he had shuddered awake his
sense of impending calamity persisted he lifted
himself on an elbow and stared about the tent the
sun shining straight into his face no doubt had
caused his fantasy about the sun-worshipers

  he got to a sitting posture yawning and blink-
ing his eyes outside the day was perfectly still
a bird chirped querulously in the corral he could
hear the llamas snuffling then he heard repeated
the groan that had disturbed him in his sleep it
came from the secretarys cot

  the engineer glanced across then came fully
awake instead of the young author pethwick saw
an old white-haired man lying in the cot with the
back of his head showing past the blankets the
engineer stared at this thing blankly a suspicion
that demetriovich had changed cots passed through
his mind but a glance showed him the old savant
still asleep on his proper bed

  the engineer got up stepped across and leaned
over this uncanny changeling it took him a full
half-minute to recognize in the drawn face and
white hair of the sleeper the boy standifer

  a shock went over the engineer he put his hand
on the authors shoulder 

  standifer he shouted standifer

  as standifer did not move pethwick called to
the professor with an edge of horror in his voice
the old savant sprang up nervously

  what is it

 here look at this boy see what has happened
 the scientist stared from his cot rubbed his
 eyes and peered

 is-is that standifer

 yes

 whats happened to him

 i havent the slightest idea professor

 the scientist jabbed his feet into his slippers and
 came across the tent he shook the sleeper gently
 at first but gradually increased his energy till the
 cot squeaked and the strange white head bobbed on
 the pneumatic pillow

 standifer standifer

 but the youth lay inert

 he stripped the covers and the underclothes of
 the young man

 standifer lay before them naked in the cold
 morning air his undeveloped physique looked blu-
 ish then on the groin of his right leg pethwick
 noticed an inflamed splotch that looked like a severe
 burn

 m demetriovich turned to his medicine-chest and
 handed pethwick an ammonia bottle to hold under
 the boys nose while he loaded a hypodermic with
 strychnin solution a moment later he discharged
 it into the patients arm

 a shudder ran through standifer at the powerful
 stimulant his breathing became better and after
 a bit he opened his eyes he looked drowsily at the
 two bending over him and after a minute whisp-
 ered-

 whats matter

 how do you feel

 sleepy is it time to get up

 do you ache-hurt

 the secretary closed his eyes evidently to take
 stock of his feelings

 my head aches my-my leg burns

 he reached down and touched the inflamed spot
 as the strychnin took firmer hold the boy became
 alert enough to show surprise at his own state he
 eased his sore leg to the floor and sat up on the
 edge of the cot both his companions began a
 series of questions

 standifer had no idea what was the matter with
 him he had not bruised either his head or his leg
 nothing had happened to him through the night
 that he recalled nor on the preceding day after a
 bit he remembered the sale of his books and drew
 from under his pillow the gold which he had re-
 ceived

 a thought crossed pethwicks mind that pablo
 pasca had crept in during the night and had as-
 saulted the sleeper demetriovich took the bag
 and inspected it smelled of it gingerly pethwick
 watched him with some curiosity

 how did you bring this home yesterday after-
 noon james queried the old man

 the secretary thought

 in my pocket

 in your right trousers pocket

 standifer made a movement to place his right
 and left sides and said

 yes

 put on your trousers

 the youth did so working his sore leg carefully
 inside


amazing stories

  put that gold in your pocket does it fall di-
rectly over the burn

  standifer cringed and got the metal out as quickly
as possible

  i should say so

  m demetriovich nodded

  and you slept with the gold under your pillow
last night for safe-keeping

  yes

  then that did it diagnosed the scientist

  but how can gold-

  the stuff must be poisoned somehow ill see if
i can find how

  the savant moved to the table containing his
chemicals and test-tubes

to pethwick the idea of poisoned gold sounded
more like the extravagance of the middle ages
than a reality occurring in the twentieth century
the engineer stood beside the table and watched
the professor pursue his reactions for vegetable
and mineral poisons standifer limped to the en-
gineers side in the silver bowl of an alcohol lamp
the boy caught a reflection of himself he leaned
down and looked at the tiny image curiously at
length he asked

  pethwick is there anything the matter with my
hair

  then pethwick realized that the boy did not
know his hair was white and he found to his sur-
prise that he hated to tell standifer he con-
tinued watching the experiment as if he did not
hear

  standifer took up the lamp and by holding its
bowl close he got a fair view of his head he gave
a faint gasp and looked for a mirror at that in-
stant demetriovich took the only mirror on the
table to condense a vapor floating out of a tube the
old man began talking quickly to the engineer
pethwick this is the cleverest destructive stroke
that the bolshevists have ever invented

  what is it

  i still dont know but they have poisoned this
gold they could probably do the same thing to
silver it makes the circulation of money deadly
it will perhaps cause the precious metals to be dis-
carded as media of circulation

  the engineer looked incredulous

  its a fact do you recall how the report of
ground glass in candies cut down the consumption
of confectionery if a large body of men should
persistently poison every metal coin that passes
through its hands-who would handle coins why
gentlemen he continued as the enormity of the af-
fair grew on him this will upset our whole com-
mercial system it will demonetize gold no wdnder
that scoundrel offered our secretary so much gold
for a book or two he wanted to test his wares
the old mans hand trembled as he poured a blue
liquid from one test-tube to another

  i am constrained to believe that in this valley
of the infernal river we are confronted with the
greatest malignant genius mankind has ever pro-
duced

  why should he want to demonetize gold inter-
rupted pethwick

  it will force mankind to adopt a new standard

of value and to use an artificial medium of ex-
change-labor-hour checks perhaps whose very
installation will do more to socialize the world than
any other single innovation

  the two friends stood watching him anxiously
you cant find what they do it with

  not a trace so far it seems to defy analysis
notice observed pethwick your electroscope
is discharged

  m demetriovich glanced at the gold-leaf electro-
scope and saw that its tissue leaves were wilted
suddenly standifer interrupted

  pethwick is my hair white did that stuff turn
my hair white he seized the mirror look
look he cried out of nervous shock and a pro-
foundly wounded vanity

  the engineer turned with genuine sympathy for
the author but in turning he saw a man standing
in the entrance watching the excitement with a
slight smile

  the engineer paused abruptly staring

  the stranger was a medium-sized indian with an
abnormally developed head and a thickly painted
face he wore the usual shirt and trousers of a
cliolo and for some reason gave pethwick a strong
impression of cesare ruano why he resembled
cesare pethwick could not state even after he
had inspected him closely to judge from the in-
dians faintly ironic expression he must have been
observing the scientists for several minutes

  m demetriovich first regained his self-posses-
sion

  are you the man who gave my boy this gold
he asked sharply indicating the metal with which
he was experimenting

  the painted man looked at the heap

  i gave a boy some gold for some books he ad-
mitted

  well thats the gold all right snapped peth-
wick

 did you know the gold you gave him was
poisoned proceeded the savant severely
poisoned how was it poisoned

  that is for you to tell us

  i dont know in the least what effect did it
have

  the mans tones were completely casual without
fear regret or chagrin you see for yourself
what it did

  the stranger looked at standifer in astonishment
and presently ejaculated

  is that the same boy

  you see you nearly killed him stated the scien-
tist grimly

  it was quite accidental i dont understand it
myself let me look at his trouble

  he walked over with more curiosity than regret
in his manner

  pethwick watched the fellow with a sharp and ex-
traordinary dislike it was so sharp that it drove
out of his mind the amazing fact of finding this
sort of person in such a desolate valley

  standifer exhibited the burn the stranger
looked at it touched a spot here and there and fin-
ally said more with the air of an instructor lectur-
ing his inferiors than with that of an indian talk-
ing to white men
the green splotches



  this is the effect of a metal which i carried with
the gold a metal-i dont know what you call it
in your language-possibly you may never have
heard of it here is some

  he reached in his pocket and drew out a piece
of silvery metal as large as a double eagle and
dropped it on the table before m demetriovich

  the old savant glanced at the metal then looked
more carefully

  its radium he said in a puzzled voice its
the largest piece of radium i ever saw-its the
only piece of pure metallic radium i ever saw it
-its worth quite a fortune-and owned by an
indian

  here m demetriovich breached his invariably
good manners by staring blankly at his guest

  so you are acquainted with it observed the
stranger with interest

  not in its metallic form i have extracted its
bromides myself and ive seen radium burns
before i might have known it was a radium burn
but i never dreamed of that metal

  but that was gold that burned me complained
standifer

  thats true agreed m demetriovich but you
see the emanations of radium have the power of
settling on any object and producing all the ef-
fects of radium itself the gentleman carried those
lumps of gold in his pockets along with about two
million dollars worth of radium the old savant
laughed briefly at the eeriness of the situation
the gold became charged with radium burned
your leg and whitened your hair it also affected my
electrostat

the three men turned to the stranger who ap-
parently carried fortunes of various metals
jingling loose in his pocket

  sir began the savant we must apologize to
you for our unjust suspicions

  do you mean your suspicions were incorrect
queried the red man

  i mean said the old savant with dignity for
this was no way to take an apology that we were
morally culpable in attributing to you criminal mo-
tives without waiting for conclusive evidence

  the stranger smiled at this long sentence

  i can understand your idea without your speak-
ing each word of it but the idea itself is very
strange he stroked his chin and some paint rub-
bed off on his fingers showing a lighter yellowish
skin beneath then he laughed if you should
apologize for every incorrect idea you maintain
gentlemen i should think your lives would be one
long apology

  the superciliousness the careless disdain in thi
observation accented pethwicks antipathy to the
man

  at that moment the fellow asked-

  do all your species live in cloth shelters such
as these

  standifer who seemed more kindly disposed to-
ward the stranger than the others explained that
tents were temporary shelters and that houses were
permanent

  the newcomer continued his smiling scrutiny of
everything and at last asked

  cant you gentlemen even communicate with
each other without using words and sentences

  he paused then as if to simplify what he had
said and went on-

  suppose you mr pethwick desire to communi-
cate with mr- he made a gesture toward the

scientist and added-mr demetriovich would

you be forced to articulate every word in the sen-
tence

  how did you come to know my name asked
the engineer surprised have we met before
the stranger laughed heartily i am sure we
have not i see you desire my name well i have
a number in my country the citizens are numbered
i am sure when your own countries become densely
populated you too will adopt a numerical nomen-
clature

  what is your number asked standifer quite
astonished at this as indeed were his companions
---

  the secretary laughed

  it sounds like a cross between a combination
lock and a football game where do you come from
mr-mr three

  the painted man nodded down the valley cas-
ually

  the name of my country is one or first he
smiled of course that is a very ancient and un-
scientific name but notation must begin some-
where and it usually begins at home now i dare
say each one of you lives in a country called one-
no i see i am wrong then he repeated in a low-
er tone america-rumania-peru-very pretty
names but unscientific

  by this time mr threes remarkable feat of call-
ing the mens names and then calling the countries
of their birth made the explorers realize that they
had encountered an amazing man indeed

  do you read our thoughts before we speak
cried standifer

  mr three nodded easily

  certainly without that all study of the lower
animals would be a mere cataloguing of actions and
habits

  pethwick wondered if the fellow meant a very
delicate insult to begin talking about the study of
lower animals so promptly when the conversation
naturally turned on himself and his companions
he said nothing but mr three smiled

  but m demetriovich was utterly charmed with
the vistas of investigation the mans suggestion
opened to him

  why that would be wonderful would it not
he cried

  certainly without mind-reading comparative
psychology is impossible

  we have professional mind-readers cried m
demetriovich with enthusiasm i wonder why the
psychologists have never thought to have one try to
read the minds-say of the higher simians

  mr three seemed to find all of this conversation
funny for he laughed again but his words were
quite serious

  besides this mentage as we call mind-reading
enables one to converse with every other creature
just as i am talking to you i take your language
forms right out of your own minds and use them


amazing stories

if the creature has no language at all you still re-
ceive its impressions

by this time even pethwick who disliked the fel-
low almost to the point of hatred realized that
the stranger was wonderful indeed the engineer
decided mr three came from some unknown coun-
try which he reluctantly admitted to himself
seemed to be more highly cultured than england or
america so by accepting these facts pethwick in
a way prepared himself not to be too surprised at
anything

  do all your countrymen understand mentage or
mind-language enquired the engineer

  it is our national mode of communication i
observe you move your hands when you talk-ges-
tures you call it in one we speak a word now and
then to accent our thoughts-verbal gestures some
of our population who are nervous sometimes
speak several words or even complete sentences
often it is an affectation unless of course he
added politely as if to exempt his companions their
minds are not strong enough to converse without
words

  on the other hand a few well-placed words
make speeches and especially orations very im-
pressive still some of our greatest orators never
utter a sound but i consider this too much re-
pression in fact rather an academic thing to do
what you would call a -a-a highbrow thank
you mr standifer for thinking me the term

  it would be a great saving of time mused
pethwick

  yes indeed in one a person can present a
whole thought or a whole series of thoughts in a
single flash of the brain if the thinkers brain is
sufficiently strong it is almost instantaneous
standifer smiled blissfully

  think of instantaneous sermons lets get to
that place

  pethwick and the professor did not share in
standifers badinage but sat amazed at this being
whose name was a number the engineer realized
the futility of all the questions he could ask turn
the idea about suppose mr three should ask
pethwick to explain american civilization in a cas-
ual talk it would be impossible so it was im-
possible for mr three to give mr pethwick much
idea of the land of one

  mr demetriovich took up the questioning
have you been using radium for a long time
mr three

  for centuries we are in the midst of a radium
age it was developed out of the uranium age
and that out of the aluminum age all this arose
out of a prehistoric steel age a very heavy clumsy
metal i have heard archaeologists say

  you dont mean your mechanical appliances
are made out of radium

  no radium is our source of power it has
changed our mechanics from molecular mechanics
to atomic mechanics the first men of one could
utilize only molecular energy such as steam and
gasolene with the aid of radium we soon de-
veloped the enormous force that lies concentrated
in the atom this gives my countrymen unlimited
power it can be derived from any sort of matter

because all matter is composed of atoms and our
force is generated through the destruction of
atoms

  all this time mr threes voice was growing
weaker and weaker until finally he said-

  you will have to excuse me from any further
conversation gentlemen my throat is not accus-
tomed to much talking

  he tapped it with an apologetic smile as he
did so he glanced about and his eyes lit on the
chess-board and men which pethwick and m
demetriovich had been using the previous evening

  what is that

  a game

  who plays it ah m demetriovich and mr
pethwick i would not object to a party if you
feel disposed

  professor and i will try a consultation game
against you suggested pethwick moving a stool
over to the table

  i dont understand the game but if you will just
think how the pieces are moved requested the
mind-reader i dare say i will soon learn

  the engineer framed the demonstration in his
mid and mr three nodded

  i see it seems to be a sort of rudimentary
stage of a game we call cube in first however
cube is an entirely mental game although young
children are given material boards and pieces to
assist them in focusing their attention

   cube has eight boards such as this superim-
posed upon one another each board has thirty-two
pieces on it thus giving two-hundred and fifty-six
pieces in all each player controlling one hundred
and twenty-eight all the major pieces can move
up or down forward or backward but the pawns
can only advance or go higher as no real boards
are used the whole play must be kept in mind
the game becomes a contest of intricacy that is
until one player grows confused makes an inco-
herent move and is checkmated it is a very pleas-
ant amusement for persons who have nothing more
serious to think about

  i have seen mental chess-players in america
observed standifer but they use only one board
i suppose more would complicate it i dont play
myself

  the chess-players made no answer to this re-
mark but set up the men mr three defeated the
scientists combined skill in a game of ten moves

as this extraordinary party was brought to a
conclusion pablo pasca entered the tent with
breakfast on a tray when the thief saw the guest
he almost dropped the food but after a moment
came in and placed the dishes on the table as he
did so he looked meaningly at pethwick nodded
faintly and retired

  the engineer excused himself and followed the
indian he found pablo in the kitchen tent
shaken out of his ordinary stoicism

  do you know who he is senor he asked in a
low voice

  his name is three said pethwick involun-
tarily guarding his own tone

  no i mean do you know he is the man who
murdered cesare ruano asked the thief earnestly

  the engineer nodded
the green splotches



id thought of that how do you know he did
how dios mio-everything the man has on
is cesares cesares clothes cesares shoes
on his finger is cesares ring-the ring cesare was
saving to be garroted in

  i thought somehow he resembled cesare
nodded pethwick and i knew it was not his face
ciertamente not cesare but his murderer
aspirated pablo excitedly i saw this fellow be-
hind this very boulder this same fellow
pethwick nodded in the sunlight unaware that
pablo expected him to do anything indeed the
engineer was glad he had come out of the tent
mr threes intelligence was oppressive so now he
stood breathing deeply as if from some struggle
the cliffs the sunshine the river the savor of the
kitchen almost made him doubt the existence in
his tent of such a personage as mr three from the
land of one where in heavens name was that
land did there flourish over behind the andes
somewhere an unknown race of extraordinary arts
and sciences who called themselves the first

  and there recurred to him his fancy that if such
a nation existed it must be an offshoot of the old
incan race perhaps fugitives flying before the old
conquistadores found a haven in some spot and there
had built up the most advanced civilization upon
the face of the earth the thought was utterly
fantastic and yet it was the only explanation of
mr three sitting there in the tent

  well said pablo interrogatively

  the engineer came out of his reverie

  is that all you wanted to tell me

  all isnt that enough

  oh yes

  arent you going to do anything demanded
pablo he is an indian i thought when indians
killed any one the white men garroted them qwk
like that he pinched his throat and made a
disagreeable sound

  what am i to do inquired pethwick blankly
blessed virgin does not the white mans law
work in the valley de rio infiernillo i knock an
old man on the head and barely save my neck this
cholo kills my good caviarada wears his clothes
steals the very ring cesare meant to be garroted
in what happens to him why he sits at the
table with white men and plays ehue a fine
justice

  the engineer hardly knew how to answer this
he stood looking at pablo rather blankly he felt
sure an attempt to arrest mr three would prove
perilous indeed on the other hand pablos atti-
tude demanded that pethwick should act

  isolated like this pethwick was the lone repre-
sentative of the great anglo-saxon convention of
justice it is a strange convention that polices
every clime and every tongue red brown black
and yellow men refrain from violence because the
white man says

  thou shalt not kill

  wherever a single unit of the white race is
placed that law inheres in him men of all colors
come to him and say murder has been done
now what will you do

  and he must act

  he must deal out that strange anglo-saxon con-

vention called justice or he must die in the attempt

  that is what the white race means it is what
civilization means it is not any one white man
who has this power of judging and punishing it
is any white man they are the knight-errants of
the earth each one must fight sit in judgment and
administer justice to the best of his ability and
conscience so help him god

  it is the most amazing hegemony on the face of
the earth when one comes to think of it-and the
most universally accepted

  now pablo was asking pethwick an account of
his stewardship

  certainly the engineer did not think of the prob-
lem in just those terms he was not conscious of
his racial instinct he thought in rather loose
american fashion that since pablo had put it up
to him like this he would have to do something
the zambo began again

  look at what i did i only knocked an old man
on the head-

  pethwick interrupted with a gesture

  pablo get those handcuffs you and cesare used
to wear and bring em to the tent

  si senor hissed the half-breed gratefully
pethwick turned back toward the tent with thor-
ough distaste for his commission as he entered
mr three glanced up with quizzical eyes and it
suddenly flashed on the engineer with a sense of
embarrassment that the man from one already
knew what was in his thoughts

this was soon proved mr three nodded his
head smilingly

  yes he said pablo is quite right here is
the ring

  he held up a hand and displayed an old silver
ring engraved in the form of a snake

  m demetriovich glanced up at this extraordinary
monologue

  then you did kill cesare ruano exclaimed
the engineer

mr three paused for a moment then answered
yes i did there is no use going through a
long catechism i may also add i knew the emana-
tions of radium would have some effect on the
boy standifer but i did not know what

the old savant stared at the man from one
be careful what you say mr three your con-
fession will place you in jeopardy of the law
then you maintain laws in this country ob-
served mr three what will be the nature of
the instruction you will give me

  no instruction said pethwick punishment
a very antiquated custom i should think any-
one could see that criminals need instruction

  at that moment pablo appeared in the entrance
with the manacles

  this is hardly the time to enter into an abstract
discussion of punishment mr three observed
pethwick brusquely he held the manacles a mo-
ment a little self-consciously then said you may
consider yourself under arrest

  to pethwicks surprise the man from one of-
fered no resistance but peaceably allowed himself to
be chained to the chair in which he sat he
watched the procedure with faintly amused expres-


amazing stories

sion and even leaned over to observe how the anklets
were adjusted to his legs

  a certain air of politeness about the incan at
last constrained pethwick to say

  you understand mr three we are forced to
do this-it is the law

  and you rather dislike me anyway do you not
mr pethwick added three genially

  the engineer flushed but kept his eyes steadily
on mr threes

  i dislike you but i dislike to do this more
after the shackling the captors stood unde-
cidedly so they had captured the murderer of
cesare ruano

  well have to carry him before a magistrate
pondered m demetriovich its very annoying
m demetriovich said mr three still smiling
in his chains you have studied physiology
yes

  and perhaps vivisection

  certainly

  then why all this disturbance about killing a
lower animal for scientific ends

  the old rumanian looked at mr three stead-
fastly i cannot accept your point mr three we
are all human beings together even if cesare
ruano did not have the culture-

  the rather pointless proceedings were inter-
rupted by a burst of snorting and braying from the
corral pethwick hurried outside for the pack
animals were really of more importance than the
prisoner the engineer got out just in time to see
pablo go at full speed toward the enclosure the
indian had a jepeating rifle and no doubt feared
the attack of a puma or jaguar

  on pethwicks heels came both m demetriovich
and the white-haired secretary the valley was
strewn with boulders big and little and the men had
difficulty in running over broken ground from
afar off pethwick saw that the down-river side of
the corral had been knocked down and all the
llamas and mules came storming out flying down
toward the camp as if the fiends pursued them

  pablo fired his rifle in the air in an effort to
turn them as he did so the zambo reeled as if
he had received a mighty but invisible blow mules
and llamas plunged straight past their staggering
master and for a moment pethwick was afraid they
would run him down

  next moment the engineer heard the secretary
and the professor shouting at the top of their
voices he looked around and saw the comb of his
tent on fire

  thought of his prisoner likely to burn up sent
pethwick sprinting breathless toward the tent as
the flames rushed over the oiled canvas pethwick
jerked up the ground-pins of the rear wall and
shoved under

  mi three still sat in the chair with arms and
legs bound to the posts he slumped queerly his
hat dropped down on his shirt half suffocated
the engineer grabbed up chair manacles man and
all and rushed into the open

  once outside he dropped his burden and began
to slap at the fire on his own clothes the other
men began to put out the fire on mr threes gar-
ments at their strokes the garments collapsed

  inside cesare ruanos clothes was an empty
human skin cut off at the neck m demetriovich
drew it out of the burning rags it had a cicatrice
across its breast from nipple to nipple it had bullet
wounds in legs and buttocks it tallied exactly
with the police description of the marks on the
skin of cesare ruano

  with colorless faces the men stood studying the
ghastly relic of the murderer in the brilliant sun-
shine

  the pack-animals were just disappearing down
the river valley a few remaining shreds of cloth
burned where their tent once stood about them
the sinister landscape lay empty

chapter v

rof demetriovich held up the grue-
some relic

  gentlemen he stated in his matter-of-
fact voice somebody-something has been stalk-
ing us masked in this

  but why masked standifers voice was tinged
with horror

  he was stalking us in a human skin exactly as
a hunter stalks a deer in a deer robe returned m
demetriovich

  then wasnt he a human being gasped the
secretary

  it certainly was the devil gasped pablo pasca
with a putty face the prefect told us not to
come here

  he knows he is a human being accented peth-
wick irritably but he doubts if we are did you
notice his manner did you observe the supercil-
ious egotistical conceited air of everything he did
or said he put us down as darwins connecting
link we are animals to him he puts on one of
our skins to hunt us down otherwise he was
afraid we would go scampering off from him like
rabbits

  then he is a fool if he thought white men are
animals declared pablo angrily

  well hes not exactly a fool either admitted
pethwick grudgingly but every single thing he
said was a knock at us i never heard- the
engineers angry voice trailed off into angry silence

  the party stood puzzling over the extraordinary
tactics of the man from one as they buffeted the
problem in their brains a rabbit dashed almost
under their feet bound down the valley they paid
no attention to it

  ill give you my guess offered pethwick i
still believe we have encountered one of the ancient
incans in prescotts account of them you notice
the highest arts of civilization mingled with the
grossest barbarities a custom of wearing an
enemys skin may have grown up among them just
as our north american indians used to take scalps
no doubt this fellow was spying on our number
i expect him to return soon with a band and at-
tempt our capture

  what a curious fate for the delong geograph-
ical expedition mused the white-haired young
secretary

  still objected m demetriovich it might be a
bolshevist method of spreading terror
the green

   so professor you dont believe after all he put
on cesares skin to stalk us queried standifer

  james i dont know what to think admitted
the savant

  the whole thing fits in better with my incan
theory pressed the engineer the half-civilized
indians around here like pablo and cesare could
very easily be afraid of some highly developed
branch of the incans especially if the incans were
seeking victims to sacrifice to the sun under such
circumstances it might be necessary to slip on the
hide of a half-breed to get near the others

  it would also explain why that man ambushed
our party when we entered the valley added the
secretary

  thanks standifer for helping me out said
pethwick it would also show why the peons
around here call this the rio infiernillo and give it
such a wide berth

   m demetriovich pulled his chin

   your theory seems to hang together right now
he admitted if you are on the right track we
will have a marvel to report-if we ever get back

  then too went on pethwick encouraged
since the prefect warned us against the valley it
suggests to me there has been something sinister
here for years-long before bolshevism became a
power

  these are queer theories laughed standifer
one going to the extremely ancient and the other
to the extremely modern

   during the latter part of this discussion an atok
a sort of huge native rodent slithered down the
valley past the scientists dodging from one
boulder to another now a peruvian fox whisked
past

  the unusual animals passing within a few min-
utes proved sufficient to draw pethwicks attention
from the subject under discussion the engineer
looked up the stony stretch and a surprising sight
filled his eyes

   the whole valley worked with glimpses of flying
animals rats hares civets what not darted here
and there from covert to covert along the edge
of the river slunk a panther making cat-like rushes
between hiding-places the shrill whistle of three
frightened deer sounded down the valley

   it seemed as if a wave of fear were depopulating
the whole rio infiernillo all the engineer could see
was innumerable furtive dodgings from the dull
surface of the river arose a loon screaming and
it boomed down stream with fear-struck speed
only one animal fled in the open a huge black bear
with a white muzzle the ucumari he was king of
the andes as the grizzly reigns in the rockies he
lunged down the middle of the canon taking the
whole infernal valley for his course he was
afraid of nothing in the sierras-except what was
behind him

   the scientists hurried out from in front of the
brute and let him lunge by unchallenged they
stared up the burnt valley marveling at this exodus
of animals 

   presently far away against the blackish stones
pethwick descried what seemed to be yellow fleas
hopping among the boulders

splotches	s

  that must be what made our pack-animals
break loose cried the engineer

  wonder what they are from the author

  i say its the devil making a drive answered
pablo crossing himself with fervor

  the animals kept darting past the distant fleas
grew into bugs then into some sort of animals and
at last were defined against the charnel gulch as
human beings

  jumping jehosophat cried standifer they
are those incans you were talking about pethwick
scores of em theyve come for us

  the secretary stepped around behind a large
boulder that hid everything except his head

  others of the expedition followed suit hardly
knowing what to believe

  the approaching party were yellow men each
one carried something in his hand that flashed like
metal they leaped from boulder to boulder in
their chase with amazing activity the very
vicunas themselves that skittered along the craggy
sides of the valley did not exhibit a greater agility

  pablo pasca notwithstanding his belief that all
this was a great drive of the devil nevertheless be-
came excited at the passing game as one speckled
deer came shimmering down through the diamond-
like sunshine pablo determined to beat satan out
of one carcass so he leveled his rifle for a shot
the author saw it and put his fingers to his ears
to dull the report

  at that moment a voice quite close to the party
broke the silence with

  dont shoot there must be no holes in the
skins

  the word skins brought the party around with
a start they were nervous on the topic the
secretary however still stood with his fingers in
his ears watching deer

  on top of a large boulder still wearing his look
of condescension and amusement sat the recent
prisoner of the expeditionmr three since he had
flung off cesares clothes and skin the weird crea-
ture was without apparel and sat naked in the cold
vivid sunshine his body of a clear yellowish com-
plexion and his large head still painted a coppery
red

it was the most grotesque combination pethwick
could have imagined but mr three maintained
a perfect composure dignity-and condescension
his painted face had the faintly amused expression
of a man watching the antics of say some pet
goats

  the fellows body suggested to pethwick a ripe
pear or yellow peach his hands and feet were
disagreeably small-sure sign of ancient and
aristocratic blood he must have slipped right
through the manacles the moment his captors
turned their backs in one hand he held a small
metallic rod

  pethwick stared at the remarkable transforma-
tion and finally blurted out

  did you break loose from the handcuffs and set
fire to our tent

  the fire was quite accidental assured the man
from one i did it with this focusing-rod when
i got rid of your quaint old manacles
amazing stories

  rfocusing-rod caught up standifer for not-
withstanding all he had suffered at the hands of
mr three the pride of a flattered author and the
remarkable sale of his books left him with a kindly
feeling in his heart for the fellow

  yes focusing-rod

  what does it focus

  wireless power

  we have transmission of wireless power in
america observed the professor but that is cer-
tainly the most compact terminal i ever saw

  mr three glanced at the rod in his hand

  oh yes this is one of the primitive instruments
i fancy this came into use among thinking creatures
along with fire the keystone of the arch and the
old-fashioned seventy-two-mile gun they were
important additions to human knowledge but their
discoverers and the dates of their discovery are lost
in prehistoric eras

  for a moment mr three sat pensively in the
sunshine his mind dwelling on that misty time in
the land of one when some unrecorded genius
found out how to focus wireless power with a little
metal rod no doubt to this mysterious man the
principle of the i-od appeared so simple that any
rational creature would know it

  presently he came out of his reverie and waved
his focusing bar down the valley

  you men he directed will follow the rest of
the quarry down the river-everything must go
for a moment the scientists stared at him not
understanding

  what is it inquired standifer

  follow the quarry down the valley and be quick
about it snapped the yellow man brusquely

  an indignant flush swept over pethwick

  you must be crazy three well do as we
please

  why should we go inquired demetriovich with
his academic suavity

  mr three tapped impatiently with his rod on
the boulder

  so our commander can select specimens to
carry to one he explained briefly

  oh i see cried pethwick somewhat mollified
he wants us to help him select the animals as
we are naturalists

  for once in their intercourse mr three showed
genuine surprise he sprang to his feet and stared
at them

  you help him select you the gnome broke
into the most insulting of jaughter you bunch
of idiots he is going to select one of you as a speci-
men to carry to one here he threw off his brief
tolerance of opposition and shouted forward
march i dont want to have to use force

  for a moment the men stood almost paralyzed
with amazement mr three evidently read the
mental state for he put a hand over his mouth to
conceal his grin and to maintain his air of grim
authority

  pethwick first organized active resistance pablo
pasca still stood with his rifle at ready pethwick
whispered sharply to the indian

  get him

  almost by reflex action the zambo swung his
rifle on mr three and fired

  at the same moment pablo staggered backward
as if he had received a powerful blow out of the
air his rifle clattered to the stones at the same
instant pethwick felt a sensation like a strong elec-
tric shock standifer grunted and clapped a hand
to his already wounded leg

  at this act of war the party of scientists threw
themselves flat behind boulders pethwick adjusted
his rifle with hands shaking from his shock and
then peered around his shelter for a glimpse of mr
three he saw the yellow man still standing on
the boulder the engineer eased his rifle around
unsteadily the head of the gun wavered about
the big painted head with a determined effort
the engineer settled it on his target he was just
squeezing the trigger when tingling knots rushed
through his arms legs and body stiffening them
flashing fire in his brain beating him with a thou-
sand prickly hammers it was an electric shock
he flattened under it squirming and twisting

   the moment his thought of opposition vanished
in pain the shock ceased

  all three white men and the indian lay motion-
less the only sound pethwick could hear was an
occasional groan from standifer and the faint pat-
ter of passing animals

  a ray of sardonic amusement fluttered through
the engineers dizzy brain-the delong geograph-
ical expedition captured as a curious species of
lower animals

  sudden hearty laughter from the nearby boulder
told the engineer that mr three had caught the
jest and was enjoying it pethwick flushed angrily

after this convincing contest with the focusing-
rod the expedition abandoned resistance and
surrendered themselves as prisoners of war or per-
haps it would be more accurate to say prisoners of
science

  although pablo had shot at -mr three the
strange being regarded it no more than if a cat had
scratched at him instead of being angry he really
tried to comfort the men he told them only one
of their number would be taken as a specimen to
the land of one the person chosen would be re-
tained alive and if he proved tractable he would
undoubtedly be allowed to run at large within cer-
tain limits and might be taught simple tricks where-
with to amuse the visitors at the zoo such as play-
ing a simple game of chess on one board

  this may or may not have been a sarcastic fling
at the feeble game of chess which pethwick had
just played at any rate the thought of playing end-
less games of chess through the bars of a zoological
cage filled the engineer with nausea no doubt on
one side of him would be a monkey begging for
peanuts and on the other a surly orang for peth-
wick did not doubt the specimen selected would be
classed among the simians

  as they walked along the engineer thought up a
new line of defense he began to threaten mr
three with the american army and navy he told
the yellow man this expedition was american and
their capture would be no small affair they were
a famous scientific body they would be missed
their abduction would mean a war between the
land of one and the whole league of nations
the green splotches

  at this mr three interrupted incredulously

  do you creatures really compose a scientific
body

  pethwick was so cut by the remark that he
stopped talking and walked along in silence

  the professor plied his captor with many ques-
tions he discovered that the men from one had
a portable furnace and were extracting radium from
the outcrop of pitchblende in the valley the mys-
terious burned places which pethwick had noted in
his journal were spots where the furnace had been
operated the strange lights which the expedition
had seen on several occasions were the men moving
the furnace from one place to another mr three
explained that they always moved the furnace at
night it was difficult to do this during the day
because the suns rays created an etheric storm

  the yellow mans conversation entertained the
white men notwithstanding their uncertain fate
pablo pasca however trembled on the verge of col-
lapse he knew he was in the hands of the imps
of satan now and then pethwick heard him
groan

  oh mother of heaven oh if i could get back
to the garrote poor cesare ruano in torment
without his skin-or the ring he meant to be gar-
roted in

  animals still rushed past the party and behind
them came the yellow beaters scaring up the game

  it was useless for anything to hide from these
terrible men with their focusing-rods evidently
they could sense an animals fright and locate it as
an ordinary man can locate a sound as soon as
they found something in a covert a slight electric
shock sent it headlong after the other animals

  for the first time in his life pethwick felt some
kinship for the lower animals he too was in the
battue one with the foxes and rabbits that fluttered
past him for ages man had slaughtered the lower
animals exactly as the men from one were doing
now

  and just as man had annihilated the bison the
apteryx the dodo so no doubt this new and more
powerful race from one would exterminate man
and his cities his works of art and his sciences
the vision of a charnel world painted itself on his
depressed imagination-a wiping out of existing
races and a repeopling by these yellow incans
compared to such such a conflict the late world war
would be trivial

amid the day-dream of armageddon the engi-
neer heard m demetriovich ejaculate to
himself

  so it is a german bolshevist undertaking after
all theres a zeppelin

  pethwick looked up suddenly the prisoners had
rounded a turn in the valley not more than three
hundred yards distant rose an enormous structure
in the shape of a zeppelin it required a second
glance to observe this fact as the huge creation
stood on its end instead of lying horizontal as do
the ordinary flying-ships

  instead of being made of cloth this zeppelin had
a skin of white metal no doubt aluminum indeed
for the first time a dirigible had been constructed
that had the staunchness and air-worthiness that

deserved the name ship this was no mere bubble
of varnished cloth

  it was enormous it rose some seven hun-
dred and fifty feet high an amazing skyscraper of
silver whose fulgor was enhanced by the dark and
melancholy background of the infernal valley

  the immense vessel rested on its stern which
tapered down to perhaps four feet in diameter it
was shored up with long metal rods anchored in
the earth the rods some hundred feet long were
inserted in the airship just where its great barrel
began to taper to its stern

  five hundred feet up the side of the cylinder
pethwick noticed the controlling planes which
looked exceedingly small for the vast bulk they were
designed to pilot when the engineer pointed these
out to the professor m demetriovich seemed
surprised

  do you realize pethwick what their small size
indicates the speed of this ship through the air
must be prodigious if these tiny controls grip the
air with sufficient leverage to direct this monster

  then the old scientist went on to commend the
novel idea of landing the dirigible on her stern
it did away with wide maneuvering to gain alti-
tude this aluminum dirigible could drop into a
hole slightly larger than her own diameter and
launch herself out of it straight at the sky it was
an admirable stroke

  workmen dotted the vessels side scrubbing the
bright skin as assiduously as a crew painting a
man-of-war pethwick could distinguish this
scrubbing force up for two or three hundred feet
beyond that he caught only glimmers of moving
dots amid the reflections of the sun

  the organization of the crew seemed cast along
military lines small squads of men or soldiers
marched in exact ranks and files over the valley to
gather up the animals stunned by the focusing-rods

  at first pethwick had not observed these animals
but a more careful look showed him a number of
specimens that had been struck down as they passed
the ship the big-headed yellow men were collect-
ing these in cages evidently for exhibition purposes
when they returned to the extraordinary land from
which they came the slaughter had not been
wasteful only one member of each species had
been taken

  the yellow men worked at top speed and were
plainly under the continual barked orders of sol-
diery but oddly enough not a sound was heard
the whole control was mental the silence gave
pethwick the strange impression that he was look-
ing at a gigantic cinema

a movement behind the white men caused
them to look around a file of yellow soldiers
was moving toward the dirigible coming from the
direction of their burned camp up the valley
these men bore the mounted skeletons which the
delong geographical expedition had observed
when they first entered the strange valley of the
rio infiernillo

  the removal of these objects suggested to peth-
wick that the men from one and their super-
dirigible would soon sail from the valley a great
curiosity to see the departure seized the engineer


amazing stories

he looked for the big driving propellers which he
thought must draw the ship but he could see none

  at that moment four soldiers with a large metal
cage approached the delong geographical party
at the same time on one of the upper rounds of
the airship some seventy-five feet above the base
appeared a yellow man with a peculiar scintillating
star fixed to his big yellow head the personage
looked directly toward the explorers but said
nothing

  when he looked mr three drew himself up and
saluted in military fashion

  then evidently for the benefit of his captors
mr three answered aloud the mental questions
which his superior must have put to him here
are the words of the one-sided conversation

  yes sir

  no sir

  ordinary ruby-blooded mammals sir with in-
telligence somewhat higher than monkeys sir

  they communicate their simple thoughts exactly
as monkeys do sir-by chattering

  they are absolutely insensible to all mental vi-
brations sir more completely so than the four-
legged animals

  i would suggest you take all five they will
prove very amusing sir in the national zoo their
attempts to deceive each other and to deceive even
me sir are as good as a farce i believe you will
find them much more humorous than chimpanzees
or the ordinary monkeys sir

  sorry you cant in that case i suggest we take
the brown one his color is the nearest human
then too he has the best physique none of them
have any minds to speak of

  very well sir

here mr three saluted stiffly and directed the
four workmen with the cage toward pablo pasca

  as the laborers lowered their cage and started
for the half-breed pablos eyes almost started from
his head he whirled to run but seemed to real-
ize the hopelessness of trying to escape from the
amazing agility of the men from one next mo-
ment he whipped out a knife and dashed into the
midst of his assailants slashing and stabbing like
one possessed

  but the soldiers of one had feline agility they
dodged whipped under his blows like game-cocks
one leaped straight over the heads of his com-
rades and landed headlong on the zambo it was
an unfortunate leap pablos blade caught him in
the shoulder and a dark liquid spurted out

  in the instant of withdrawing the blade the yel-
low men seized the half-breeds arms and legs
they went down with the zambo in a struggling
pile pablo kicked bit twisted his knife with a
wrist movement trying to cut something but the
yellow men worked swiftly and methodically

 quick commanded mr three we must
start in four minutes then in answer to some
question the yellow soldiers thought to him i
cant use my focusing-rod it might destroy what
little mind he has

  a moment later the yellow men got to their feet
with the ex-thief hanging between them by his
legs and arms the poor fellow turned an agonized
face to pethwick

  senor senor he screamed save me save
poor pablo oh holy mary sacred mother
senor senor pethwick

  his voice rose to a screech blood trickled from
his nostrils his face was white with fear

  pethwick stared with wide eyes at the struggle
the injustice of this capture for scientific purposes
thundered at the americans heart pethwick was
a white man of that race which deals justice among
weaker men and carries out its judgments with its
life

  at pablos shriek of despair something seemed to
snap in pethwicks head he hesitated a second
then lunged into the victorious yellow men

  he never reached them a wave of flame seemed
to lap around him then came blackness

when pethwick revived there were no more
yellow men in sight the great shining
dirigible stood entirely closed and apparently life-
less the sun was setting and its rays filled the
great charnel valley with a bloody light the
dirigible looked like an enormous red water-stand
in a few minutes the lower half of the great ship
was purple in shadow while the upper half turned
a deeper red the silence was absolute the three
white men stood staring at the strange scene

  quite suddenly from where the stern of the zep-
pelin nested on the ground broke out a light of in-
sufferable brilliancy a luminous gas seemed to
boil out in whirls of furious brightness it spread
everywhere and in its radiance the great ship stood
out in brilliant silver from stem to stern

  in that fulgor pethwick saw the restraining rods
cast off and the dirigible from the land of one
mounted straight into the green heart of the eve-
ning sky

  the moment it struck full sunlight at a height
of five hundred yards it seemed caught in some
tremendously strong wind for it moved eastward
with a velocity that increased by prodigious bounds
within half a minute its light was reduced from
the terrific glare of a furnace to the glow of a head-
light and then to a radiance like that of a shooting
star against the darkening eastern sky

  as the watchers followed it with their eyes a
strange thing happened that white light turned
to violet then indigo blue green yellow orange
and red and so faded out

  in the valle de rio infiernillo lingered a phos-
phorescent mist that told of the first mens pass-
ing it settled on the cliffs and crags and glowed
with spectral luminosity the men looked at each
other they too were covered with this shining
stuff

  gentlemen quavered m demetriovich i be-
lieve we have on us the residual emanations of
radium it will likely kill us let us go down to
the river and wash it off

  the three men set out stumbling through the
darkness guided somewhat by the faint light given
off by their own bodies

  they waded into the black waters of the infernal
river and began scrubbing each other furiously
trying to rid themselves of this dangerous luminos-
ity high above them it still shivered from cliff
the green splotches



and crag presently this faded out and there
reigned complete darkness and complete silence

on the following morning when the delong
geographical expedition was about to start
back for civilization they saw on the scene of the
conflict between pablo and the yellow soldiers where
the half-breed had stabbed his captors a number of
dark green stains

  on analysis this green also proved to be
chlorophyll	

    a communication from gilbert delong
    president of the delong geographical society
    to the trustees of the nobel prize founda-
    tion stockholm sweden

   sirs it is my privilege to bring to your atten-
tion the extraordinary journal of the delong geo-
graphical expedition into that unmapped region of
peru in the department of ayacucho known as the
valle de rio infiernillo

   enclosed with this journal is m demetriovichs
able presentation of the theory that the dirigible
observed in that valley was operated by the bol-
shevist government of either austria or russia

  also enclosed is the monograph of mr herbert
m pethwick ce who presents a most interesting
speculation tending to prove that the strange air-
craft was a development made independently of the
known civilized world by an offshoot of the an-
cient incan race depatriated by the spaniards in
 a d

  to my mind both of these hypotheses although
brilliantly maintained fail to take into consideration
two highly significant facts which are set forth
but not greatly stressed in the record of the expedi-
tion as kept by mr james b standifer sec

  these two facts are first the serial number
which served as a name of the man from one and
the other fact that in both cases where a man from
one was wounded he bled what for want of a better
term must be called chlorophyllaceous blood

  from few other writers than mr standifer
would i accept so bizarre a statement of fact but
his power of exact and minute observation is so
well attested by his well-known work reindeer in
iceland that i dare not question his strict adher-
ence to truth

  the phenomena set forth in the journal hap-
pened that is beyond cavil the problem for the
scientific world is their interpretation

   in handling this problem i shall not only assume
that the journal is accurate but i shall still further
assume that the being known in the record as mr
three told the precise truth in every statement
ascribed to him 

  i have every confidence in mr threes probity
for several reasons first he has no motive for
prevarication second a man who habitually com-
municates with his fellows by telepathy would not
be accustomed to falsehood since falsehood is
physically impossible when a mans mind lies be-
fore his companions like an open book third to
a man habitually accustomed to truth lying is a
difficult and uncongenial labor in brief lying is
like any other art it requires practise to do it well

   in regard to the serial number both of the above

mentioned writers apparently fail to see the enor-
mous problem it possesses as for the chlorophyl-
laceous blood our authors pass it with a vague sur-
mise that somehow it is used in extracting gold
when the whole object of the expedition according
to mr three was not gold but radium

  because my esteemed colleagues neglected these
two critical points their whole theories as ably
and ingeniously defended as they are to my mind
collapse into mere brilliant sophisms

  in the brief analysis herewith presented i shall
touch on a number of points among which the
questions evoked by the serial number and the
chlorophyll blood will be noticed in their proper
places

  first then mr three himself states that the
object of the expedition was the extraction of ra-
dium from the pitchblende in the infernal valley
the use the men from one made of this radium was
demonstrated at the departure of the dirigible for
that vessel must have been propelled by the ema-
nations of radium according to the description
of mr standifer the ship used no screw propellers
or tractors but a powerful emanation of radium
from under its stern shot the great metal cylinder
upward exactly as powder propels a skyrocket

  that radium would possess such power is well
known it has been calculated that two pounds of
radium would possess sufficient force to swing the
earth out of its orbit

  with such power the airship would be capable
of enormous speed a high speed was guessed by
m demetriovich when he observed the small con-
trolling plane however the vastness of this speed
was demonstrated by mr standifer in the last
paragraph of his account by his curious observa-
tion that the airship as seen against the evening
sky turned violet indigo blue green yellow orange
red and then was lost in other words it ran
through the whole spectrum from the most rapid
to the lowest vibrations per second and then
vanished

  what is the meaning of this significant detail

  allow me to recall an analogy in sound the tone
of a bell on a train departing at high speed becomes
lower in pitch this is because the vibrations reach
the ear at longer intervals

  apply that to the change of light observed 
the airship then the vessel must have been with-
drawing at such a speed that it lowered the pitch
of light vibrations from white to red and finally
cancelled its light in blackness

  the only conclusion to be drawn from this is
that at the time of the lights extinction the mys-
terious metal cylinder was hurtling through space
at the speed of light itself that is to say at a speed
of one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per
second

observe that i say space not air in the
first place such a speed in air would fuse any
metal but there is another and a better reason

  it requires the average human eye one-twentieth
of a second to perceive a color change  if mr
standifer had observed these color changes at the
highest possible nerve rate the operation would
have acquired seven-twentieths of a second let


amazing stories

us assume it required half a second during that
interval the cylinder would have traversed at the
speed of light ninety-three thousand miles in a
straight line that is more than eleven times the
diameter of this globe therefore it is far outside
of our atmosphere also it proves the mysterious
vessel was not bound for austria or russia it
was leaving the earth

  how was this velocity attained

  i submit by the reaction of radium upon sun-
light

  as every schoolboy knows the drift of a comets
tail is caused by the pressure of light as soon as
this airship arose to the height of about five hun-
died yards into sunlight it began to drift east-
ward with a rapidly increasing velocity in other
words the metal skin of the ship which mr peth-
wick took for aluminum was probably a much
lighter metal-a metal so light that it was capable
of being buffeted along in the surf of sunlight now
if the ship were propelled merely on the barbs of
sunbeams it would have attained the velocity of
light but the velocity of radium emanations is
one-fifteenth that of light so by running down
the light current and allowing the radium to react
against the sunbeams a speed of one and one-
fifteenth the velocity of light may be generated
that is one-hundred and ninety-eight thousand
miles per second

  such speed would admit of interplanetary travel

  however it is probable the men from one could
accelerate the radiation from radium by electrical
or chemical means they may have learned to boil
the metal as men boil water in such case the pres-
sure of its radiation would be vastly increased
and with it the possible speed of the ship this
gives an unknown and problematical power of
transition far beyond the velocity of light at such
rate a journey even to one of the fixed stars would
be within the realm of possibility

  we may therefore with prudence hypothesize that
the mysterious ether ship observed in the valley
of the rio infiernillo was an interstellar voyager
stopping by the earth as a coaling port to refuel
with radium

  however as it is improbable that the ether ship
was going beyond the confines of our solar system
a speculation as to what planet the men from one
were bound may be reached by noting the day and
the hour the ship sailed from the earth

  as our earth swings around the ecliptic it would
be possible for interplanetary mariners to obtain
a favorable current of sunlight in any direction
no doubt the navigator of the ether ship was
bound for one of the planets in opposition to the
sun at the time of the ships departure that is to
say the yellow men were sailing for either neptune
or jupiter

  that the men were returning to some planet
much larger than the earth is suggested by their
small size and extraordinary agility no doubt
these men found the gravitation of the earth slight
compared with the attraction to which they were
accustomed this fact gave them extraordinary
vigor

  now let us consider the serial number that

formed mr threes name it was --
-

  this gives rise to a most interesting speculation

  the probable number of the units contained in a
series when any serial number is given is com-
puted by multiplying together the component parts
of the serial number

  for instance if one has two series of twelve
each the whole number of objects would be twenty-
four if one had six major series of two subseries
of twelve each the total number of units would be


  applying this idea to mr threes serial number
one would find the total probable population of
jupiter or the land of one by multiplying the com-
ponent parts of this number together this reached
the enormous number product of 
that is to say fourteen and a half quadrillions

  this utterly quashes the incan hypothesis there
is not room in south america for fourteen and a
half quadrillion people-there is not room on the
globe for such a number that in fact is the prob-
able population of either neptune or jupiter for
sake of simplicity we will assume it is jupiter

  no wonder then with such an inconceivable
population the inhabitants of jupiter are militar-
ized no wonder they suggested bolshevism to m
demetriovich

  with such masses of life all other species of
animals are probably extinct this would explain
why the jovians were so eager to capture specimens
of fauna as well as radium

  the last point in the record the chlorophyllaceous
blood has been to me the most difficult to find any
analogy for in our terrestrial experience

  however we must needs grasp the problem firm-
ly and proceed with considered but ample steps to-
ward any conclusion to which it leads

  chlorophyll is the coloring matter in plants it
possesses the power of utilizing energy directly
from sunlight there is no reason to doubt that in
the veins of the jovians it still retains that pe-
culiar power

  with such an extraordinary fluid in his veins it
might be possible for a jovian to stand in the sun-
shine and to obtain from it energy and strength
just as a human being obtains energy and strength
by eating vegetables that have stood in the sun-
shine

  in fact the first method is no more amazing than
the second if indeed there be a difference un-
doubtedly our human method is the more fantastic
the idea of obtaining energy from sunshine not by
standing in it as any one would suppose but by
eating something else that has stood in it is
grotesque to the verge of madness

  let us pursue that thought no doubt in a con-
course of fourteen and a half quadrillion inhabitants
space would be so dear that there would be no va-
cant or tillable land therefore on jupiter every
man must absorb whatever sunshine he received
there would be no such thing as eating

  this accounts for the amazement of mr three
at seeing standifer eat his lunch

  to put the same idea in another form-the crew
of the ether ship were flora not fauna

  this accounts for the yellow pear-like texture of
the green splotches



their skins no doubt the young jovians are green
in color it would also explain why mr three was
entirely without anger when attacked and without
pity for pablos pleadings or for standifer when
he was burned or for ruano when he was mur-
dered

  anger pity love and hatred are the emotional
traits of the mammalia they have been developed
through epochs of maternal protection it is not
developed in plants

  mr three was a plant

  it would also explain why mr three took only one
animal of each species instead of a male and a fe-
male sex is perhaps unknown on jupiter mr
three was perhaps expecting his animals to bud
or sprout

the last question to be broached is how is it
possible for plant life to possess mobility

  i wish to recall to the inquirer that here on our
own globe the spores of the algae and other plants
of that order have the power of swimming freely in
the sea still they are plants-plants just as mo-
bile as fishes they become stationary only at a
later stage of their development

  now if for some reason these algae spores
could retain their mobility the result would be a
walking swimming or crawling plant

  the line between animal and plant life has never
been so clearly drawn it seems mere fortuity that
the first forebear of animal life swam about and
caught its sustenance by enveloping it in its gela-
tinous droplet rather than by adhering to a reef
and drawing its energy directly from the sun

  if that far-off protozoa had clung to the reef the
reader of this paragraph might have been a syca-
more or a tamarind-he would not have been a
man

  now mr threes forefather evidently crawled out
of the sea into the sunshine but found nothing to

envelop therefore he followed the lip of the jovian
tide up and down drawing his energy from the
suns rays the result was a walking vegetable-
in short mr three

under the knife

- tiyjimvells -

author of the first men in the moon in the abyss etc

    flashing suddenly out of the darkenss there came a flying multitude of particles of rock glittering like dust-specks in a
sunbeam  and then i saw a bright spot of light that shone a little to one side of my path growing very rapidly larger

and perceived that it was the planet saturn rushing toward me
under the knife

hat if i die under it the thought
recurred again and again as i walked
home from haddons it was a purely
personal question i was spared the
deep anxieties of a married man and
i knew there were few of my intimate friends but
would find my death troublesome chiefly on ac-
count of their duty of regret i was surprised in-
deed and perhaps a little humiliated as i turned
the matter over to think how few could possibly
exceed the conventional requirement things came
before me stripped of glamour in a clear dry light
during that walk from haddons house over prim-
rose hill there were the friends of my youth

i perceived now that our affection was a tradition
which we foregathered rather laboriously to main-
tain there were the rivals and helpers of my later
career i suppose i had been cold-blooded and un-
demonstrative-one perhaps implies the other it
may be that even the capacity for friendship is a
question of physique there had been a time in
my own life when i had grieved bitterly enough at
the loss of a friend but as i walked home that
afternoon the emotional side of my imagination
was dormant i could not pity myself nor feel
sorry for my friends nor conceive of them as griev-
ing for me

  i was interested in this deadness of my emo-
tional nature-no doubt a concomitant of my stag-
nating physiology and my thoughts wandered off
along the line it suggested once before in my
hot youth i had suffered a sudden loss of blood and
had been within an ace of death i remembered
now that my affections as well as my passions had
drained out of me leaving scarce anything but a
tranquil resignation a dreg of self-pity it had
been weeks before the old ambitions and tender-
nesses and all the complex moral interplay of a man
had reasserted themselves it occurred to me that
the real meaning of this numbness might be a
gradual slipping away from the pleasure-pain guid-
ance of the animal man

it has been proven i take
it as thoroughly as any-
thing can be proven in
this world that the
higher emotions the
moral feelings even the
subtle unselfishness of
love are evolved from the
elemental desires and
fears of the simple ani-
mal  they are the harness
in which mans mental
freedom goes and it
may be that as death overshadows us as our pos-
sibility of acting diminishes this complex growth
of balanced impulse propensity and aversion whose
interplay inspires our acts goes with it leaving
what

  i was suddenly brought back to reality by an
imminent collision with the butcher-boys tray i
found that i was crossing the bridge over the re-
gents park canal which runs parallel with that
in the zoological gardens the boy in blue had
been looking over his shoulder at a black barge ad-
vancing slowly towed by a gaunt white horse in

the gardens a nurse was leading three happy little
children over the bridge the trees were bright
green the spring hopefulness was still unstained
by the dusts of summer the sky in the water was
bright and clear but broken by long waves by
quivering bands of black as the barge drove
through the breeze was stirring but it did not
stir me as the spring breeze used to do

  was this dullness of feeling in itself an anticipa-
tion it was curious that i could reason and fol-
low out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever
so at least it seemed to me it was calmness
rather than dullness that was coming upon me
was there any ground for the belief in the presenti-
ment of death did a man near to death begin
instinctively to withdraw himself from the meshes
of matter and sense even before the cold hand was
laid upon his i felt strangely isolated-isolated
without regret-from the life and existence about
me the children playing in the sun and gathering
strength and experience for the business of life
the park-keeper gossiping with a nursemaid the
nursing mother the young couple intent upon each
other as they passed me the trees by the wayside
spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight the
stir in their branches-i had been part of it all
but i had nearly done with it now

  some way down the broad walk i perceived that
i was tired and that my feet were heavy it was
hot that afternoon and i turned aside and sat down
on one of the green chairs that line the way in a
minute i had dozed into a dream and the tide of
my thoughts washed up a vision of the resurrec-
tion i was still sitting in the chair but i thought
myself actually dead withered tattered dried one
eye i saw pecked out by birds awake cried
a voice and incontinently the dust of the path and
the mould under the grass became insurgent i
had never before thought of regents park as a
cemetery but now through the trees stretching
as far as eye could see i beheld a flat plain of

writhing graves and heel-
ing tombstones there
seemed to be some trou-
ble the rising dead ap-
peared to stifle as they
struggled upward they
bled in their struggles
the red flesh was torn
away from the white
bones awake cried a
voice but i determined i
would not rise to such
horrors awake
they would not let me
alone wike up said an angry voice a cockney
angel the man who sells the tickets was shaking
me demanding my penny

  i paid my penny pocketed my ticket yawned
stretched my legs and feeling now rather less
torpid got up and walked on towards langham
place i speedily lost myself again in a shifting
maze of thoughts about death going across
marylebone road into that crescent at the end of
langham place i had the narrowest escape from
the shaft of a cab and went on my way with a pal-
pitating heart and a bruised shoulder it struck

 rvhe master of scientifiction has written a remark-
 able tale and although the title may scare you o at
 first the story is not of the horror type at all quite
 the contrary wells knows his ps and qs and in this
 story particularly you will find nothing to complain about
 other authors would perhaps foist a real horror talc upon
 you but wells as usual handles his material in a mas-
 terful manner have you ever undergone an operation
 if you have then perhaps you will appreciate more than
 other readers this fascinating tale


amazing stories

me that it would have been curious if my medita-
tions on my death on the morrow had led to my
death that day

but i will not weary you with more of my ex-
periences that day and the next i knew more
and more certainly that i should die under the
operation at times i think i was inclined to pose
to myself the doctors were coming at eleven and
i did not get up it seemed scarce worth while to
trouble about washing and dressing and though
i read my newspapers and the letters that came by
the first post i did not find them very interesting
there was a friendly note from addison my old
sehool-friend calling my attention to two discrep-
ancies and a printers error in my new book with
one from langridge venting some vexation over
minton the rest were business communications
i breakfasted in bed the glow of pain at my side
seemed more massive i knew it was pain and
yet if you can understand i did not find it very
painful i had been awake and hot and thirsty in
the night but in the morning bed felt comfortable
in the night-time i had lain thinking of things that
were past in the morning i dozed over the ques-
tion of immortality haddon came punctual to the
minute with a neat black bag and mowbray soon
followed their arrival stirred me up a little i
began to take a more personal interest inthe pro-
ceedings haddon moved the little octagonal table
close to the bedside and with his broad back to
me began taking things out of his bag i heard
the light click of steel upon steel my imagination
i found was not altogether stagnant will you
hurt me much i said in an off-hand tone

  not a bit haddon answered over his shoulder
we shall chloroform you your hearts as sound
as a bell and as he spoke i had a whiff of the
pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic

  they stretched me out with a convenient ex-
posure of my side and almost before i realized
what was happening the chloroform was being ad-
ministered it stings the nostrils and there is a
suffocating sensation at first i knew i should die
-that this was the end of consciousness for me
and suddenly i felt that i was not prepared for
death i had a vague sense of duty overlooked-i
knew not what what was it i had not done i
could think of nothing more to do nothing desir-
able left in life and yet i had the strangest dis-
inclination to death and the physical sensation
was painfully oppressive of course the doctors
did not know they were going to kill me possibly
i struggled then i fell motionless and a great
silence a monstrous silence and an impenetrable
blackness came upon me

  there must have been an interval of absolute
unconsciousness seconds or minutes then with a
chilly unemotional clearness i perceived that i was
not yet dead i was still in my body but all the
multitudinous sensations that come sweeping from
it to make up the background of consciousness had
gone leaving me free of it all no not free of it
all for as yet something still held me to the poor
stark flesh upon the bed-held me yet not so
closely that i did not feel myself external to it in-
dependent of it straining away from it i do not

think i saw i do not think i heard but i per-
ceived all that was going on and it was as if i both
heard and saw haddon was bending over me
mowbray behind me the scalpel-it was a large
scalpel-was cutting my flesh at the side under the
flying ribs it was interesting to see myself cut
like cheese without a pang without even a qualm
the interest was much of a quality with that one
might feel in a game of chess between strangers
haddons face was firm and his hand steady but
i was surprised to perceive how i know not that
he was feeling the gravest doubt as to his own wis-
dom in the conduct of the operation

  mowbrays thoughts too i could see he was
thinking that haddons manner showed too much
of the specialist new suggestions came up like
bubbles through a stream of frothing meditation
and burst one after another in the little bright spot
of his consciousness he could not help noticing
and admiring haddons swift dexterity in spite of
his envious quality and his disposition to detract
i saw my liver exposed i was puzzled at my own
condition i did not feel that i was dead but i was
different in some way from my living self the
gray depression that had weighed on me for a year
or more and colored all my thoughts was gone i
perceived and thought without any emotional tint
at all i wondered if every one perceived things
in this way under chloroform and forgot it again
when he came out of it it would be inconvenient
to look into some heads and not forget

  although i did not think that i was dead i still
perceived quite clearly that i was soon to die this
brought me back to the consideration of haddons
proceedings i looked into his mind and saw that
he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal
vein my attention was distracted from details by
the curious changes going on in his mind his con-
sciousness was like the quivering little spot of light
which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer
his thoughts ran under it like a stream some
through the focus bright and distinct some shad-
owy in the half-light of the edge just now the
little glow was steady but the least movement on
mowbrays part the slightest sound from outside
even a faint difference in the slow movement of
the living flesh he was cutting set the light-spot
shivering and spinning a new sense-impression
came rushing up through the flow of thoughts and
lo the light-spot jerked away towards it swifter
than a frightened fish it was wonderful to think
that upon that unstable fitful thing depended all
the complex emotions of the man that for the next
five minutes therefore my life hung upon its
movements and he was growing more and more
nervous in his work it was as if a little picture of
a cut vein grew brighter and struggled to oust from
his brain another picture of a cut falling short of
the mark he was afraid his dread of cutting
too little was battling with his dread of cutting
too far

then suddenly like an escape of water from
under a lock-gate a great uprush of horrible
realization set all his thoughts swirling and simul-
taneously i perceived that the vein was cut he
started back with a hoarse exclamation and i saw

j
under the knife



the brown-purple blood gather in a swift bead and
run trickling he was horrified he pitched the
red-stained scalpel on to the octagonal table and
instantly both doctors flung themselves upon me
making hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy
the disaster ice said mowbray gasping but
i knew that i was killed though my body still clung
to me

  i will not describe their belated endeavors to
save me though i perceived every detail my per-
ceptions were sharper and swifter than they had
ever been in life my thoughts rushed through my
mind with incredible swiftness but with perfect
definition i can only compare their crowded clar-
ity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium
in a moment it would all be over and i should be
free i knew i was immortal what would happen
i did not know should i drift off presently like a
puff of smoke from a gun in some kind of half-
material body an attenuated version of my ma-
terial self should i find myself suddenly among
the innumerable hosts of the dead and know the
world about me for the phantasmagoria it had al-
ways seemed should i drift to some spiritualistic
seance and there make foolish incomprehensible
attempts to affect a purblind medium it was a
state of unemotional curiosity of colorless expecta-
tion and then i realized a growing stress upon
me a feeling as though some huge human magnet
was drawing me upward out of my body the stress
grew and grew i seemed an atom for which mon-
strous forces were fighting for one brief terrible
moment sensation came back to me that feeling
of falling headlong which comes in nightmares
that feeling a thousand times intensified that and
a black horror swept across my thoughts in a tor-
rent then the two doctors the naked body with
its cut side the little room swept away from under
me and vanished as a speck of foam vanishes down
an eddy	

  i was in mid-air far below was the west end
of london receding rapidly-for i seemed to be
flying swiftly upward-and as it receded passing
westward like a panorama i could see through
the faint haze of smoke the innumerable roofs
chimney-set the narrow roadways stippled with
people and conveyances the little specks of squares
and the church steeples like thorns sticking out of
the fabric but it spun away as the earth rotated
on its axis and in a few seconds as it seemed
i was over the scattered clumps of town about
ealing the little thames a thread of blue to the
south and the chiltern hills and the north downs
coming up like the rim of a basin far away and
faint with haze up i rushed and at first i had
not the faintest conception what this headlong rush
upward could mean

  every moment the circle of scenery beneath me
grew wider and wider and the details of town and
field of hill and valley got more and more hazy
and pale and indistinct a luminous gray was min-
gled more and more with the blue of the hills and
the green of the open meadows and a little patch
of cloud low and far to the west shone ever more
dazzlingly white above as the veil of atmosphere
between myself and outer space grew thinner the
sky which had been a fair springtime blue at first

grew deeper and richer in color passing steadily
through the intervening shades until presently it
was as dark as the blue sky of midnight and pres-
ently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight
and at last as black as no blackness i had ever be-
held and first one star and then many and at last
an innumerable host broke out upon the sky more
stars than any one has ever seen from the face of
the earth for the blueness of the sky is the light
of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad blind-
ingly there is diffused light even in the darkest
skies of winter and we do not see the stars by
day only because of the dazzling irradiation of the
sun but now i saw things-i know not how as-
suredly with no mortal eyes-and that defect of
bedazzlement blinded me no longer the sun was
incredibly strange and wonderful the body of it
was a disc of blinding white light not yellowish
as it seems to those who live upon the earth but
livid white all streaked with scarlet streaks and
rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues
of red fire and shooting half-way across the
heavens from either side of it and brighter than
the milky way were two pinions of silver white
making it look more like those winged globes i
have seen in egyptian sculpture than anything
else i can remember upon earth these i knew
for the solar corona though i had never seen any-
thing of it but a picture during the days of my
earthly life

  when my attention came back to the earth
again i saw that it had fallen very far away from
me field and town were long since indistinguish-
able and all the varied hues of the country were
merging into a uniform bright gray broken only
by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scat-
tered in flocculent masses over ireland and the west
of england for now i could see the outlines of
the north of france and ireland and all this island
of britain save where scotland passed over the
horizon to the north or where the coast was blurred
or obliterated by cloud the sea was a dull gray
and darker than the land and the whole panorama
was rotating slowly towards the east

all this had happened so swiftly that until i
was some thousand miles or so from the earth
i had no thought for myself but now i perceived
i had neither hands nor feet neither parts nor
organs and that i felt neither alarm nor pain all
about me i perceived that the vacancy for i had
already left the air behind was cold beyond the
imagination of man but it troubled me not the
suns rays shot through the void powerless to light
or heat until they should strike on matter in their
course i saw things with a serene self-forgetful-
ness even as if i were god and down below there
rushing away from me-countless miles in a second
-where a little dark spot on the gray marked the
position of london two doctors were struggling to
restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell
i had abandoned i felt then such release such
serenity as i can compare to no mortal delight i
have ever known

  it was only after i had perceived all these things
that the meaning of that headlong rush of the
earth grew into comprehension yet it was so sim-


amazing stories

pie so obvious that i was amazed at my never
anticipating the thing that was happening to me
i had suddenly been cut adrift from matter all
that was material of me was there upon earth
whirling away through space held to the earth by
gravitation partaking of the earth-inertia moving
in its wreath of epicycles round the sun and with
the sun and the planets on their vast march
through space but the immaterial has no inertia
feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter
where it parts from its garments of flesh there
it remains so far as space concerns it any longer
immovable in space i was not leaving the earth
the earth was leaving me and not only the earth
but the whole solar system was streaming past
and about me in space invisible to me scattered
in the wake of the earth upon its journey there
must be an innumerable multitude of souls stripped
like myself of the material stripped like myself of
the passions of the individual and the generous
emotions of the gregarious brute naked intelli-
gences things of new-born wonder and thought
marvelling at the strange release that had sud-
denly come on them

  as i receded faster and faster from the strange
white sun in the black heavens and from the broad
and shining earth upon which my being had begun
i seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast
vast as regards this world i had left vast as re-
gards the moments and periods of human life very
soon i saw the full circle of the earth slightly gib-
bous like the moon when she nears her full but
very large and the silvery shape of america was
now in the noonday blaze wherein as it seemed
little england had been basking but a few minutes
ago at first the earth was large and shone in
the heavens filling a great part of them but every
moment she grew smaller and more distant as she
shrank the broad moon in its third quarter crept
into view over the rim of her disc i looked for
the constellations only that part of aries directly
behind the sun and the lion which the earth cov-
ered were hidden i recognized the tortuous tat-
tered band of the milky way with vega very bright
between sun and earth and sirius and orion shone
splendid against the unfathomable blackness in the
opposite quarter of the heavens the pole star was
overhead and the great bear hung over the circle
of the earth and away beneath and beyond the
shining corona of the sun were strange groupings
of stars i had never seen in my life-notably a
dagger-shaped group that i knew for the southern
cross all these were no larger than when they
had shone on earth but the little stars that one
scarce sees shone now against the setting of black
vacancy as brightly as the first-magnitudes had
done while the larger worlds were points of in-
describable glory and color aldebaran was a spot
of blood-red fire and sirius condensed to one point
the light of innumerable sapphires and they shone
steadily they did not scintillate they were calmly
glorious my impressions had an adamantine hard-
ness and brightness there was no blurring softness
no atmosphere nothing but infinite darkness set
with the myriads of these acute and brilliant points
and specks of light presently when i looked again
the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun and

it dwindled and turned as i looked until in a sec-
onds space as it seemed to me it was halved
and so it went on swiftly dwindling far away in
the opposite direction a little pinkish pins head
of light shining steadily was the planet mars i
swam motionless in vacancy and without a trace
of terror or astonishment watched the speck of
cosmic dust we call the world fall away from me

  presently it dawned upon me that my sense of
duration had changed that my mind was moving
not faster but infinitely slower that between each
separate impression there was a period of many
days the moon spun once round the earth as i
noted this and i perceived clearly the motion of
mars in his orbit moreover it appeared as if the
time between thought and thought grew steadily
greater until at last a thousand years was but a
moment in my perception

at first the constellations had shone motionless
against the black background of infinite space
but presently it seemed as though the group of
stars about hercules and the scorpion was con-
tracting while orion and aldebaran and their
neighbors were scattering apart flashing sud-
denly out of the darkness there came a flying multi-
tude of particles of rock glittering like dust-specks
in a sunbeam and encompassed in a faintly lumi-
nous cloud they swirled about me and vanished
again in a twinkling far behind and then i saw
that a bright spot of light that shone a little to
one side of my path was growing very rapidly
larger and perceived that it was the planet saturn
rushing towards me larger and larger it grew
swallowing up the heavens behind it and hiding
every moment a fresh multitude of stars i per-
ceived its flattened whirling body its disc-like belt
and seven of its little satellites it grew and grew
till it towered enormous and then i plunged amid
a streaming multitude of clashing stones and
dancing dust-particles and gas-eddies and saw for
a moment the mighty triple belt like three concen-
tric arches of moonlight above me its shadow
black on the boiling tumult below these things
happened in one-tenth of the time it takes to tell
them the planet went by like a flash of lightning
for a few seconds it blotted out the sun and there
and then became a mere black dwindling winged
patch against the light the earth the mother
mote of my being i could no longer see

  with a stately swiftness in the profoundest
silence the solar system fell from me as if it had been
a garment until the sun was a mere star amid the
multitude of stars with its eddy of planet-specks
lost in the confused glittering of the remoter light
i was no longer a denizen of the solar system i
had come to the outer universe i seemed to grasp
and comprehend the whole world of matter ever
more swifty the stars closed in about the spot where
antares and vega had vanished in a phosphor-
escent haze until that part of the sky had the sem-
blance of a whirling mass of nebulae and ever be-
fore me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness
and the stars shone fewer and fewer it seemed as
if i moved towards a point between orions belt
and sword and the void about that region opened
vaster and vaster every second an incredible gulf
under the knife



of nothingness into which i was falling faster and
ever faster the universe rushed by a hurry of
whirling motes at last speeding silently into the
void stars glowing brighter and brighter with
their circling planets catching the light in a ghostly
fashion as i neared them shone out and vanished
again into inexistence faint comets clusters of
meteorites winking specks of matter eddying
light-points whizzed past some perhaps a hundred
millions of miles or so from me at most few nearer
traveling with unimaginable rapidity shooting con-
stellations momentary darts of fire through that
black enormous night more than anything else
it was like a dusty draught sunbeam-lit broader
and wider and deeper grew the starless space the
vacant beyond into which i was being drawn at
last a quarter of the heavens was black and blank
and the whole headlong rush of stellar universe
closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gath-
ered together it drove away from me like a mon-
strous jack-o-lantern driven by the wind i had
come out into the wilderness of space ever the
vacant blackness grew broader until the hosts of
the stars seemed only like a swarm of fiery specks
hurrying away from me inconceivably remote and
the darkness the nothingness and emptiness were
about me on every side soon the little universe of
matter the cage of points in which i had begun to
be was dwindling now to a whirling disc of lu-
minous glittering and now to one minute disc of
hazy light in a little while it would shrink to a
point and at last would vanish altogether

  suddenly feeling came back to me-feeling in
the shape of overwhelming terror such a dread of
those dark vastitudes as no words can describe a
passionate resurgence of sympathy and social de-
sire were there other souls invisible to me as i
to them about me in the blackness or was i in-
deed even as i felt alone had i passed out of
being into something that was neither being nor
not-being the covering of the body the covering
of matter had been torn from me and the hallu-
cinations of companionship and security every-
thing was black and silent i had ceased to be i
was nothing there was nothing save only that
infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf
i strained myself to hear and see and for a while
there was naught but infinite silence intolerable
darkness horror and despair

  then i saw that about the spot of light into
which the whole world of matter had shrunk there
was a faint glow and in a band on either side
of it the darkness was not absolute i watched it
for ages as it seemed to me and through the long
waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more distinct
and then about the band appeared an irregular
cloud of the faintest palest brown i felt a pas-
sionate impatience but the things grew brighter
so slowly that they scarce seemed to change what
was unfolding itself what was this strange red-
dish dawn in the interminable night of space

the clouds shape was grotesque it seemed
to be looped along its lower side into four
projecting masses and above it ended in a straight
line what phantom was it i felt assured i had
seen that figure before but i could not think what
nor where nor when it was then the realization
rushed upon me it was a clenched hand i was
alone in space alone with this huge shadowy hand
upon which the whole universe of matter lay like
an unconsidered speck of dust it seemed as
though i watched it through vast periods of time
on the forefinger glittered a ring and the uni-
verse from which i had come was but a spot of light
upon the rings curvature and the thing that the
hand gripped had the likeness of a black rod
through a long eternity i watched this hand with
the ring and the rod marveling and fearing and
waiting helplessly on what might follow it seemed
as though nothing could follow that i should watch
forever seeing only the hand and the thing it held
and understanding nothing of its import was
the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some
greater being were our worlds but the atoms of
another universe and those again of another and
so on through an endless progression and what
was i was i indeed immaterial a vague per-
suasion of a body gathering about me came into
my suspense the abysmal darkness about the
hand filled with impalpable suggestions with un-
certain fluctuating shapes

  then suddenly came a sound like the sound of
a tolling bell faint as if infinitely far muffled
as though heard through thick swathings of dark-
ness a deep vibrating resonance with vast gulfs
of silence between each stroke and the hand ap-
peared to tighten on the rod and i saw far above
the hand towards the apex of the darkness a circle
of dim phosphorescence a ghostly sphere whence
these sounds came throbbing and at the last
stroke the hand vanished for the hour had come
and i heard a noise of many waters but the black
rod remained as a great band across the sky and
then a voice which seemed to run to the uttermost
parts of space spoke saying there will be no
more pain

  at that an almost intolerable gladness and radi-
ance rushed in upon me and i saw the circle shin-
ing white and bright and the rod shining and
black and many things else distinct and clear and
the circle was the face of the clock and the rod the
rail of my bed haddon was standing at the foot
against the rail with a small pair of scissors on his
fingers and the hands of my clock on the mantel
over his shoulder were clasped together over the
hour of twelve mowbray was washing something
in a basin at the octagonal table and at my side i
felt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken
of as pain

  the operation had not killed me and i perceived
suddenly that the dull melancholy of half a year
was lifted from my mind

the end
 the hammering man

at the bottom of each screen was a circular hole just large enough for a mans arm to go through and at trants command the
men put their arms through them  i was certain that there was but one man who could recognize or feel any emotion at
sight of that yellow and time-worn paper  i showed it to meyan and obtained this really amazing reaction


the hammering man

trant on the rainy morning
th sat alone in his office on
t as he bent closely over a heap
vritten pages spread before him
lesk a small instrument in con-
tinual motion ticked like a watch it was for him
an hour of idleness he was reading fiction and
with his passion for making visible and recording
the workings of the mind he was taking a perman-
ent record of his feelings as he read

  the instrument strapped on trants arm was
called a sphygmograph it carried a small steel
rod which pressed tightly on his wrist artery this
rod rising and falling with each rush of the blood
wave through the artery transmitted its motion
to a system of small levers these levers operated
a stylus point which touched the surface of a re-
volving drum and as trant had adjusted around
this drum a strip of smoked paper the stylus point
traced on its sooty surface a continuous wavy line
which rose and fell with each beat of the psycho-
logists pulse

  as the interest of the story gripped trant this
wavy line grew flatter with elevations farther apart
when the interest flagged his pulse returned to its
normal beat and the line became regular in its un-
dulations at an exciting incident the elevations
swelled to greater height and the psychologist
was noting with satisfaction how the continual
variations of the line gave definite record of the
storys sustained power when he was interrupted
by the sharp ring of his telephone

  an excited choleric voice came over the wire
mr trant   this is cuthbert edwards of
cuthbert edwards  co michigan avenue you
have received a communication from my son win-
ton this morning is he there now    no
then he will reach your office in a very few mo-
ments i want nothing whatever done in the mat-
ter you understand i will reach your office my-
self as soon as possible-
probably within fifteen
minutes-and explain

  the sentence ended
with a bump as cuthbert
edwards slammed his re-
ceiver back upon its
hook the psychologist
who would have recog-
nized the name-even if
not forewarned by the
communication he had re-
ceived that morning-as
the conservative head of
one of the oldest and most
exclusive chicago families of new england puri-
tan extraction detached the sphygmograph from his
wrist and drew toward him and reread the fantastic
advertisement that had come to him inclosed in win-
ton edwards letter apparently it had been cut
from the classified columns of one of the big dailies

  eva the th of the th  since you and
your own are safe do you become insensible that
others now again wait in your place and those
that swing in the wind have you forgot if you
remember and are true communicate and you



can help save them all n m     
ib    

  the letter to the first page of which the adver-
tisement had been pinned was dated chicago
april th the same day he had received it post-
marked three oclock that morning and written in
the scrawling hand of a young man under strong
emotion

  dear sir before coming to consult you i send
for your consideration the advertisement you will
find inclosed this advertisement is the one tan-
gible piece of evidence of the amazing and inex-
plicable influence possessed by the hammering
man over my fiancee miss eva silber this in-
fluence has forced her to refuse to marry me-to

tell me that i must think of her only as if she were
dead

  this advertisement appeared first on last monday
morning in the classified columns of three chicago
papers published in english and in the german
s- on tuesday it appeared in the same morn-
ing papers and in four evening papers and the ger-
man a- it was submitted to each newspaper

by mail with no address or information other than
the text as here printed with three dollars in cur-
rency inclosed yi each case to pay for its insertion
for gods sake help me mr trant i will call on
you this morning as soon as i think you are at your
office	winton edwards



  the psychologist had hardly finished this letter
when rapid footsteps in the corridor outside stop-
ped at his office door never had there been a more
striking entrance into trants office than that of the
young man who now burst in-disheveled wet with
the rain his eyes red for want of sleep

  she has left me mr trant he cried with no
prelude she has gone

  as he sank dazedly into
a chair he pulled from
his pocket a small leather
case and handed it to the
psychologist within was
the photograph of a re-
markably handsome girl
in her early twenties-a
girl sobered by some un-
usual experience as
showed most plainly in
the poise of her little
round head wrapped with
its braid of lustrous hair
and the shadow that
lurked in the steadfast eyes though they were
smiling and the full lips were smiling too

  you are i presume mr winton edwards
said trant picking up the letter on his desk now
if you have come to me for help mr edwards you
must first give me all the information of the case
that you have

  that is eva silber young edwards replied
miss silber had been employed by us a little over
a year she came to us in answer to an advertise-
ment she gave us no information in regard to
herself when she came and she has given none

 yjjther trant the psychological detective is
 back on the job this month with a scientifiction
 tale which will keep you absorbed and will arouse your
 curiosity to no mean degree the strange part about it all
 is that although the story is written as fiction the results
 can be obtained readily any time today as the instru-
 ments used are well known and can be found in any uni-
 versity and up-to-date college laboratory strange to say
 however our courts so far have not been willing to use
 psychological reactions but no doubt sooner or later they
 will do so


amazing stories

since because of her marked ability my father
put her in complete charge of the houses correspond-
ence with our foreign agents for in addition to
english she speaks and writes fluently german
french the magyar dialect of hungary russian
and spanish

  i was in love with her almost from the first in
spite of my fathers objection to the attachment
the first edwards of our family mr trant came
to massachusetts in  so my father has the
idea that anybody who came later cannot possibly
be our equal and miss silber who came to america
to work-the women of our family have stayed idly
at home-did not get here until 

  coming from where asked the psychologist
i dont know the boy answered simply i
think she is an austrian for the magyar dialect
she speaks isthe least likely of the languages she
knows that she would learn by choice i spoke of
this to her once and she did not contradict me he
paused to control his agitation and then went on
she had so far as i know no friends so you
see mr trant that all that makes my fathers con-
sent to marrying her only a greater proof of her
evident goodness and charm

  then he did consent to your marrying her
trant interjected

  yes two weeks ago i had begged and begged
her to but she never had been willing to give me
her promise a week ago last wednesday after
she had known for more than a week that father had
agreed to it she finally consented-but only con-
ditionally i was going away for a short business
trip and eva told me that she wanted that much
time to think it over but when i came back she
would tell me all about herself and if i still wanted
to marry her after hearing it she would marry me
i never imagined that anyone could force her to
change her mind

  yet she did change her mind you think
without question mr trant and it seems
to have been wholly because of the visit of the
hammering man who came to see her at the office
the day after i left chicago it sounds queer to
call him that but i do not know his name or any-
thing about him except the fact of his hammer-
ing

  but if the people in the office saw him you have
at least his description

  they say he was unusually large gross almost
bestial in appearance aud red-headed he was
plainly dressed he asked to see eva when she
caught sight of him she turned back and refused to
speak with him

  how did the man take her refusal

  he seemed very angry for a moment and then
went out into the public corridor for a long time
he walked back and forth in the comdor mutter-
ing to himself the people in the office had prac-
tically forgotten him when they were startled by a
noise of hammering or pounding in the corridor
one wall of the inner office where eva had her desk
is formed by the wall of the corridor and the
man was beating upon it with his fists

   hammering excitedly asked trent

  no in a rather deliberate and measured man-
ner my father who heard the sound says it wa

so very distinctive as to be recognizable if heard
again

  odd said trant and what effect did this
have on miss silber

 that is the strangest part of it mr trant eva
had seemed worried and troubled ever since she
learned the man was there but this hammering
seemed to agitate and disturb her out of all reason
at the end of the days business she went to my
father and abruptly resigned the position of trust
she held with us my father surprised and angry
at her refusal to give a reason for this action
accepted her resignation

  you do not happen to know whether before this
visit miss silber had received any letter which
troubled her

  she may have received a message at her house
but not at the office however there is something
still more mysterious on sunday my father sorry
that he had accepted her resignation so promptly
in view of our relationship ordered the motor
and went out to see her- but good heavens

more about the lady in the case

the loud rat-tat-tat of a cane had shaken
trants door and cracked its ground glass
from corner to corner and the door was flung open
to admit a determined little man whose carefully
groomed pink-and-whiteness was accentuated by
his anger

  winton go home the elder edwards glared
sternly at his son and then about the office mr
trant-you are mr trant i suppose i want
you to have nothing to do with this matter i pre-
fer to let the whole affair drop where it is

  i reserve the right mr edwards the psycholo-
gist said rising to take up or drop cases only as
i myself see fit i have heard nothing yet in your
sons story to explain why you do not want the
case investigated

  then you shall have it explained cuthbert ed-
wards answered i called on miss silber last
sunday and it is because of what i learned there
that i want winton to have nothing more to do with
her i went to miss silber on sunday mr trant
feeling that i had been too hasty on thursday i
offered her an apology and was reasoning with her
when i heard suddenly in an upper room the
same noises that had so disturbed the quiet of my
office on thursday afternoon

  you mean the hammering trant exclaimed
precisely mr trant the hammering if
you had heard that sound yourself you would know
that it is a very definite and distinctive blow given
according to some intentional arrangement i no
sooner heard it and saw the uneasiness it again
caused in miss silber than i became certain that
the same disreputable man who had been to see miss
silber at my office was then housed in her very
home i insisted as she was provisionally my sons
promised wife on searching the house

  did you find him trant inquired sharply
no i did not mr trant though i went into
every room and opened every closet i found only
what appeared to be the usual inmates of the house
-miss silbers father and the woman who kept
house for her
the hammering man	

  miss silbers father has miss silber a
father trant interrupted

  he is hardly worth mentioning mr trant the
younger edwards explained he must have suffered
at some time from a brain trouble that has partly
deprived him of his faculties i believe neither he
nor the housekeeper who is not in evas confidence
is likely to be able to help us in this matter

  the man may have slipped out of the house un-
seen mr edwards

  quite impossible cuthbert edwards asserted
miss silber lived in a little house west of ravens-
wood there are very few houses none within at
least a quarter of a mile of her the ground is
flat and no one could have got away without being
seen by me

  your story so far is certainly very peculiar
the psychologist commented and it gains interest
with every detail are you certain it was not this
second interview with your father he turned again
to the boy that made miss silber refuse you
no it was not when i got back yesterday and
learned from father what had happened i went out
at once to eva at her home she had changed
utterly not her feelings toward me for i felt cer-
tain even then that she loved me but an in-
fluence-the influence of this man-had come be-
tween us she told me there was no longer any
question of her marrying she refused the ex-
planation she had promised to make to me she
told me to go away and forget her or-as i wrote
you-to think of her as dead

  you can imagine my feelings i could not sleep
last night after i had left her as i was wander-
ing about the house i saw the evening paper lying
spread out on the library table and my eye caught
her name in it it was this advertisement that i
sent you mr trant late as it was i called up
the newspaper offices and learned the facts regard-
ing its insertion at daybreak i motored out to see
eva the house was empty i went round it in
the mud and rain peering in at the windows even
the housekeeper was no longer there and the
neighbors could tell me nothing of the time or man-
ner of their leaving nor has any word come from
her to the office

  that is all then the psychologist said thought-
fully the th of the th  he reread
the beginning of the advertisement that is of
course a date the th of the th month and it
is put there to recall to miss silber some event of
which it would be sure to remind her i suppose
you know of no private significance this date might
have for her or you would have mentioned it
none on the th no mr trant young ed-
wards replied if it were only the th i might
help you for i know that on that date eva cele-
brates some sort of anniversary at home

in search of the hammering man

trant opened a bulky almanac lying on his
desk and as he glanced swiftly down the
page his eyes flashed suddenly with comprehension

  you are correct i think as to the influence of
the so-called hammering man on her movements
the psychologist said but as to her connection
with the man and her reasons that is another mat-

ter but of that i cannot say till i have had half an
hour to myself at the crerar library

  the library mr trant cried young edwards
in surprise

  yes and as speed is certainly essential i hope
you still have your motor below

  as young edwards nodded the psychologist
seized his hat and gloves and his instrument case
and preceded the others from the office half an
hour later he descended from the library to rejoin
the edwardses waiting in the motor

  the man who inserted that advertisement-the
hammering man i believe of whom we are in
search he announced briefly is named n meyan
and he is lodging or at least can be addressed at
no  coy court the case has suddenly developed
far darker and more villainous aspects even than
i feared please order the chauffeur to go there
as rapidly as possible

  coy court at which twenty minutes later he
bade young edwards stop the motor proved to be
one of those short intersecting streets that start
from the crowded thoroughfare of halsted street
run squalidly a block or two east or west and stop
short against the sooty wall of a foundry or ma-
chine shop number  the third house on the left
-like many of its neighbors whose windows bore
greek jewish or lithuanian signs-was given up
in the basement to a store but the upper floors
were plainly devoted to lodgings

  the door was opened by a slattern little girl of
eight

  does n meyan live here the psychologist
asked and is he in then as the child nodded
to the first inquiry and shook her head at the
second when will he be back

  he comes to-night again sure perhaps sooner
but to-night or to-morrow he goes away for good
he have paid only till to-morrow

  i was right you see in saying we had need for
haste trant said to young edwards but there
is one thing we can try even though he is not here
let me have the picture you showed me this morn-
ing

  he took from the boys hand the picture of eva
silber opened the leather case and held it so the
child could see

  do you know that lady

  yes the child showed sudden interest it
is mr meyans wife

  his wife cried young edwards

  so the psychologist said swiftly to the little
girl you have seen this lady here

  she comes last night the child had grown
suddenly loquacious because she is coming mr
meyan makes trouble that we should get a room
ready for her already she has sent her things
and we get ready the room next to his but be-
cause she wants still another room she goes away
last night again rooms come not so easy here
we have many people but now we have another so
to-night she is coming again

  does it now seem necessary for us to press this
investigation further cuthbert edwards said
caustically

  as he spoke the sound of measured heavy blows
came to them down the dark stair apparently from
mz

amazing stories

the second floor of the building the elder ed-
wards cried excitedly and triumphantly

  what is that listen that man-meyan if it
is meyan-must be here for that is the same
hammering

  this is even better luck than we could have
expected exclaimed the psychologist and he slip-
ped by the child and sped swiftly up the stairs with
his companions closely following at the head of
the flight he passed by a stunted woman-whose
marked resemblance to the little girl below estab-
lished at once her two relationships as mother and
landlady-and a trembling old man and with the
elder edwards tore open door after door of the
rooms upon that floor and the floor above before the
woman could prevent him the rooms were all
empty

  meyan must have escaped said cuthbert ed-
wards as they returned crestfallen to the second
story but we have proof at least that the child
spoke the truth in saying miss silber had been
here to see him for she hardly would have allowed
her father to come here without her

  her father so this is miss silbers father
trant swiftly turned to examine with the keenest
interest the old man who shrank back shivering and
shuddering toward a corner even in that dark-
ened hall he conveyed to the psychologist an im-
pression of hoary whiteness his hair and beard
were snowy white the dead pallor of his skin was
the unhealthy whiteness of potato shoots that have
sprouted in a cellar and the iris of his eyes had
faded until it was almost indistinguishable yet
there remained something in the mans appearance
which told trant that he was not really old-that
he still should be moving daring self-confident a
leader among men instead of cringing and shrink-
ing thus at the slightest move of these chance
visitors

  meyan is it because you are looking for
meyan that you have made all this disturbance
the woman broke in then why didnt you ask
for now he is at the saloon i think only across
the street

  then we will go there at once but i will ask
you he turned to the elder edwards to wait for
us at the motor for two of us will be enough for my
purpose and more than two may defeat it by
alarming meyan

  trant descended the stairs took his instrument
case from the motor and with young edwards
crossed the street quickly to the saloon

the story told by the pulse record of a
russian

a dozen idlers leaned against the bar or sat
in chairs tilted against the wall trant ex-
amined these idlers one after another closely the
only man at whom he did not seem to look was one
who as the only red-headed man in the place must
plainly be meyan red-headed was the only de-
scription they had of him but meager as it was
with the landladys statement as to meyan being
in the saloon trant resolved to test him

  the psychologist took an envelope from his pocket
and wrote rapidly upon the back of it

  i am going to try something he whispered

as he flicked the envelope across the table to ed-
wards it may not succeed but if i am able to get
meyan into a test then go into that back room and
speak aloud what i have written on the envelope
as though you had just come in with somebody
then as edwards nodded his comprehension the
psychologist turned easily to the man nearest him
at the bar-a pallid lithuanian sweatshop worker

  i suppose you can stand a lot of that trant
nodded to his glass of pungent whisky still-it
has its effect on you sends your heart action up-
quickens your pulse

  what are you the man grinned temperance
lecturer

  something like that the psychologist answered
at least i can show you the effect whisky has up-
on your heart

  he picked up the instrument case and opened it
the loungers gathered about him and trant saw
with satisfaction that they thought him an itinerant
temperance advocate they stared curiously at the
instrument he had taken from its case

  it goes on the arm he explained the lithuan-
ian with a grin toward his companions began to
turn up his sleeve not you trant said you
just had a drink

  is there a drink in this i aint had a drink
since breakfast said another who pushed up to the
table and bared his blue-veined forearm for trant
to fasten the instrument to it

  young winton edwards watching as curiously
as the others saw trant fasten the sphygmograph
on the mechanics arm and the stylus point com-
mence to trace on the sooty surface a wavy line the
normal record of the mechanics pulse

  you see it trant pointed out to the others the
record as it unwound slowly from the drum every
thought you have every feeling every sensation-
taste touch smell-changes the beating of your
heart and shows upon this little record i could
show through that whether you had a secret you
were trying to conceal as readily as i will show the
effect whisky has on you or as i can learn whether
this man likes the smell of onion he took from
the free-iunch on the bar a slice of onion which he
held under the mans nose ah you dont like
onion but the whisky will make you forget its
smell i suspect

  as the odor of the whisky reached the mans
nostrils the record line-which when he smelled the
onion had become suddenly flattened with elevations
nearer together as the pulse beat weakly but more
quickly-began to return to the shape it had had
at first he tossed off the liquor rolling it upon his
tongue and all saw the record regain its first ap-
pearance then as the stimulant began to take
effect the pencil point lifted higher at each rise
and the elevations became farther apart they
stared and laughed

  whisky effects you about normally i should
say trant began to unfasten the sphygmograph
from the mans wrist i have heard it said that
black-haired men like you feel its effect least of
all light-haired men more men with red hair like
mine feel the greatest effect its said we red-
haired men have to be careful with whisky
hey theres a red-headed man one of the
the hammering man



crowd cried suddenly pointing try it on him
two enthusiasts at once broke from the group
and rushed eagerly to meyan he had continued
inattentive through all to read his newspaper but
now he laid it down trant and young edwards as
he rose and slouched half curiously toward them
could see plainly for the first time his strongly
boned coarsely powerful face and heavy-lidded
eyes and the grossly muscular strength of his big-
framed body

  pah your watered whisky he jeered in a
strangely thick and heavy voice when the test had
been explained to him i am used to stronger
drinks

  he grinned derisively in the surrounding faces
kicked a chair up to the table and sat down trant
glanced toward edwards and edwards moved
silently back from the group and disappeared un-
noticed through the partition door then the
psychologist swiftly adjusted the sphygmograph up-
on the out-stretched arm and watched intently an
instant until the stylus point had caught up the
strong and even pulse which set it rising and fall-
ing in perfect rhythm as he turned to the bar for
the whisky the rear door slammed and the voice
trant was expecting spoke

  yes it was at warsaw the police took him he
was taken without warning and from his friends
house what next the prisons are full but they
keep on filling them the graveyards will be full
next

following up the clew of the sphygmograph

t ook look cried the lithuanian beside
-l trant at the table he bragged about watered
whisky but just the sight of it makes his heart
beat bigger and stronger

  trant bent eagerly over the smoked paper watch-
ing the stronger slower pulse beat which the re-
cord showed

  yes before he takes the whisky his pulse is
strengthened trant answered for that is how
the pulse acts when a man is pleased and exults
he waited now almost inattentively while meyan
drank the whisky and the others grew silent in de-
feat as the giants pulse true to his boast showed
almost no variation under the fiery liquor

  pah such child-foolishness meyan with steady
hand set the glass back on the table then as
trant unclasped the straps around his arm he
rose yawned in their faces and lounged out of the
place

  the psychologist turned to meet young edwards
as he hurried in and together they went out to
join the father at the motor

  we can do nothing sooner than to-night trant
said shortly an expression of keen anxiety on his
face i must learn more about this man but my
inquiries must be conducted alone if you will meet
me here again at seven oclock to-night say at the
pawn-brokers shop we passed upon the corner i
hope to be able to solve the mystery of the ham-
mering man and the influence he is undoubtedly
exerting on miss silber i may say he added after
a moment that i would not attach too much weight
to the childs statement that miss silber is meyans

wife it is understood then that you will meet me
here to-night as i have suggested

  he nodded to his clients and ran to catch a pass-
ing trolley car

  promptly at seven oclock in accordance with
trants directions young winton edwards and his
father entered the pawnshop and started negotia-
tions for a loan almost immediately after they ar-
rived there trant joined them still carrying in his
hand his instrument case the boy and his father
closed their negotiations and went out with trant
into the street they saw then to their surprise
that the psychologist was not alone two men were
awaiting them each of whom carried a case like
trants the elder of the two a man between fifty
and sixty years old met young edwards stare with
a benignant glance of his pale blue eyes through an
immense pair of gold spectacles the other was
young pale broad-browed with an intelligent face
and his gaze was fixed in a look of dreamy contem-
plation they were dressed as mechanics but their
general appearance was not that of workmen

  the door of meyans lodging house was opened
to them by the landlady she led the way to the
second floor but paused to show a room to trant

  that is meyans room trant explained we
will wait for him over here he followed the
woman into a small and stuffy bed-room on the other
side of the hall we had better not speak while
we are waiting and-we had better wait in the
dark

  in the strange stuffy darkened little room the
five sat in silence footsteps passed often in the
street outside and twice some one went through the
hall a half hour they waited thus then a heavier
footstep warned them of meyan coming a mo-
ment later the front door opened again and ad-
mitted-as trant felt from the effect of the first
tone which reached the boy waiting at his side-
eva silber trant quickly prevented him from
going out it was only after several minutes that
he turned on the light and motioned to the two
strangers who had come with him they immedi-
ately rose and left the room

  i am going to submit you both to a very trying
ordeal trant said to his clients in a tone so low
it could not reach the hallway and it will require
great self-control on your part within five or i
hope at most ten minutes i am going to show you
into meyans room where you will find among other
persons meyan himself and miss silber i want
you to promise that neither of you will attempt to
question or to speak to miss silber until i give
you leave otherwise i cannot allow you to go in
there and i have my own reasons for wanting you
to be present

  if it is essential mr trant- the elder ed-
wards said

  trant looked to the boy who nodded

  thank you said the psychologist and he went
out and closed the door upon them

  fully a quarter of an hour had passed in spite
of trants promise to summon them in ten minutes
before the psychologist again opened the door and
ushered them into the room they already knew as
meyans

  the long table in the center of the room had been


amazing stories

cleared and behind it three men sat in a row two
of these were the strangers who had come with
trant and the cases they had carried together with
the one trant himself had brought stood open
under the table the man who sat between these
two was meyan near the table stood miss silber

  at sight of her winton edwards made one swift
step forward before he recollected the promise he
had made and checked himself eva silber had
grown pale as death she stood now with small
hands clenched tight against her breast staring
into the face of the young american she loved
trant closed the door and locked it

a story of the russian revolution

itte can begin now i think he said

  vv he stooped at once over the instrument
eases and brought out from them three folding
screens about eighteen inches square when ex-
tended which he set on the table-one in front of
each of the three men at the bottom of each screen
was a circular hole just large enough for a mans
arm to go through and at trants command the
men put their arms through them stooping again
swiftly over the instrument cases trant took out
three sphygmographs

  he rapidly adjusted these on the arms of the
three men and set in motion the revolving drums
against which the pencil points traced their wavy
fines on smoked paper his clients leaning for-
ward in their interest could then understand the
purpose of the screens which were designed to
hide the pitilessly exact records from the three
men

  for several moments trant allowed the in-
struments to run quietly until the men had re-
covered from the nervousness caused by the begin-
ning of the test

  i am going to ask miss silber to tell you now
as briefly as she can he said after a pause
evenly and steadily the circumstances of her
fathers connection with the russian revolution
which brought him to the state you have seen and
the reasons why she has left you to go with this
man to russia

  to russia broke from winton edwards

  to russia yes the girls pale cheeks
glowed you have seen my father what he is
what they have made of him and you did not know
he was a russian you have seen him as he is
let me tell you-you who wear proudly the badge
of your revolution fought in seven short years by
your great-grandfathers-what my father was

  before i was born-it was in the year -
my father was a student in moscow he had al-
ready married my mother the year before the
czar finding even the teachings he had been advised
to permit made people dangerous closed the univer-
sities father and his fellow students protested
they were imprisoned and they kept my father
who had led the protest so long that i was three
years old before he saw his home again

  but suffering and prison could not frighten him
in zurich before he went to moscow he had been
trained for a doctor and seeing how powerless
the protest of the students had been he determined
to go among the people so he made himself a

medical missionary to the poorest the most op-
pressed the most miserable and wherever he was
called to carry a cure for disease he carried too
a word of hope of courage of protest a cry for
freedom

  late one night in a terrible snowstorm just
twenty years ago a peasant brought to our door
a note unsigned for the sake of safety it seemed
telling father that an escaped political prisoner was
dying of exposure and starvation in a hut on a
deserted farm ten miles from the town my father
hurried to his horse and set out with food and
fagots and by morning through the cold and deep
snow he reached the place

  there he found a man apparently freezing to
death and fed and warmed him and when the
fellow was able to tell his pitiful tale father boldly
encouraged him told him of the organization of
protest he was forming and asked him to join
little by little father told him all he had done and
all his plans at nightfall father held out his
hand to say farewell when the other pulled a pistol
from his pocket in the fight that followed father
was able only to wound the other upon the chest
with the blunt knife they had used to cut their
food before the spy called a confederate down from
the loft and father was overcome

  on the information of these police spies with-
out trial of any sort-fathers friends could discover
only that the name of his betrayer was valerian
urth-father was sentenced to solitary confinement
in an underground cell for life and my mother-
because she sent food and fagots to a supposed con-
vict-was exiled to siberia ten years ago her
sister who took me received word that she died 
the convict island of sakhalin but my father-
she gasped for breath-lived at least

  she stopped as suddenly as she had begun trant
who had stooped swiftly to watch his records more
closely when the name of the police spy was men-
tioned still kept his gaze steadfastly upon his in-
struments suddenly he motioned to the girl to
complete her narrative

  five years ago when i was eighteen i left my
mothers sister and went back to my fathers
friends such of them as were still free she con-
tinued many who had worked with him for the
organization had been caught or betrayed but
others and more had come in their places and they
had work for me i might move about with less
suspicion than a man so i helped prepare for the
strikes of  which at last so terrified the czar
that on the th of october he issued his manifesto
to free those in prison i had helped to free my
father with the rest i took him to hungary and
left him with friends while i came here now do
you not understand why i am going back she
turned in pitiful appeal to young edwards it is
because there is work again in russia for me to do
the russian government is taking vengeance to-
day for the amnesty of  which freed my
father

records given by the instrument

she checked herself again and turned to trant
to see if he would force her still to proceed but
he was facing intently as if fascinated the strange
the hammering man



hammering man and his two stranger com-
panions yet he was not watching their faces or
their figures at all his eyes followed the little
stylus points which before each of the three con-
tinually traced their lines of record then he took
quickly from his pocket a folded paper yellow with
age worn creased and pierced with pin marks
in the sight of all he unfolded it swiftly upon the
table before the three refolded it and put it back
into his pocket and though at sight of it no face
changed among the three even trants clients could
see how one line now suddenly grew flat with low
elevations irregular and far apart as the pencil
point seemed almost to stop its motion over the
smoked paper of the man in the middle meyan

that is all said trant in a tone of assured
triumph as he unstrapped the sphygmographs from
their wrists you can speak now mr edwards
eva cried winton edwards in wild appeal
you are not married to this man

  married no the girl exclaimed in horror
until last thursday when he came to the office
i never saw him but he has come to call me for
the cause which must be to me higher and holier
than love i must leave my love for the cause of
the russian revolution

  in the cause of the revolution so meyan
now with a heavy slouch of his muscular body left
his two companions at the table and moved up be-
side the girl have any more of you anything to
say to her before she goes back with me to russia
to her-no trant replied but to you-and
to these gentlemen he motioned to the two who
had sat at the table with meyan i have to announce
the result of my test for which they are waiting
this elder gentleman is ivan munikov who was
forced to leave russia eight years ago because his
pamphlet on inalienable rights had incurred the
displeasure of the police this younger man is
dmitri vasili who was exiled to siberia for political
offenses at thirteen years of age but escaped to
america they both are members of the russian
revolutionary organization in chicago

  but the test-the test cried vasili

     sphygmograph record of healthy pulse under
  normal conditions  and  sphygmograph records of
  dmitri vasili and ivan munikov when eva silber
  told of her fathers betrayal the lower and rapid puls-
  ation thus recorded indicate grief and horror  rec-
  ord of meyan on this occasion the strong and bound-
  ing pulse indicates joy  meyans sphygmograph
  record when trant shows the yellow note that be-
  trayed herman silber the feeble jerky pulse indi-
  cates sudden and overwhelming fear

  the test the psychologist turned sternly to face
meyan has shown as conclusively and irrefutably
as i could hope that this man is not the revolutionist
he claims to be but is as we suspected might be the
case an agent of the russian secret police and
not only that it has shown just as truly though
this fact was at first wholly unsuspected by me that
he-this agent of police who would have betrayed
the daughter now and taken her back to russia to
be punished for her share in the agitation of 
-is the same agent who twenty years ago be-
trayed the father herman silber into imprison-
ment true name from false i do not know but
this man who calls himself meyan now called him-
self then valerian urth

  valerian urth eva silber cried staggering
back into winton edwards arms

  but meyan made a disdainful gesture with his
huge fat hands bah you would try to prove
such things by your foolish test

  then you will not refuse of course trant de-
manded sternly to show us if there is a knife-
sear on your chest

  even as meyan would have repeated his denial
vasili and munikov leaped from the rear of the
room and tore his shirt from his breast the
psychologist rubbed and beat the skin and the blood
rose to the surface revealing the thin line of an
almost invisible and time-effaced scar

  our case is proved i think the psychologist
turned from the two who stared with eyes hot with
hate at the cringing spy and again faced his clients

  he unlocked the door and handed the key to
munikov then picking up his instrument cases and
record sheets with miss silber and his clients he
left the room and entered the landladys sitting
room

a happy denouement

cctxrhen i received mr edwards letter this
vv morning trant said in answer to the
questions that showered upon him it was clear to
me at once that the advertisement he inclosed de-
pended for its appeal on reminding eva silber of
some event of prime importance to herself but also
from the wording employed of popular or national
significance as well you further told me that
october th was a special holiday with miss silber
that i found to be the date of the czars mani-
festo of freedom and declaration of amnesty to
political prisoners at once it flashed upon me

  eva silber was a russian the difference be-
tween the th given in the advertisements and the
th-thirteen days-is just the present difference
between the old-style calendar used in russia and
ours

  before going to the crerar library then it was
clear that we had to do with a russian revolutionary
intrigue at the library i obtained the key to the
cipher and translated the advertisement obtaining
the name of meyan and his address and also the
name and address of dmitri vasili a well-known
pro-revolutionary writer to my surprise vasili
knew nothing of any revolutionist named meyan
it was inconceivable that a revolutionary emissary
should come to chicago and he not know of it ii
became necessary to find meyan immediately


amazing stories

  my first direct clew was the hammering that we
heard in this house it was too much to suppose
that in two separate instances this hammering
should be heard and in each case evas father be
present and no other discoverable agent and that
still he should have had nothing to do with it ob-
viously it must have been herman silber who did
the hammering at evas home and here in this
house it was obvious too that herman silber
was the your own of the advertisement

  to test meyan whom we found in the saloon
was not difficult i arranged to have him overhear
some one speaking of an arrest at warsaw which
would at once suggest itself as a hotbed of russian
revolutionists to either a revolutionist or a police
agent but the idea would certainly give positive
and very opposite reactions if the man were a true
revolutionist or if he were a spy meyans pulse
so strengthened and slowed-as under a pleasurable
stimulus-that i felt i had received confirmation of
my suspicions though i had not then the informa-
tion which would enable me to expose the man to
secure this i sought out dmitri vasili he intro-
duced me to munikov who had been a friend of
silber before his imprisonment and between them

i	got the history of herman silber and his daughter

  i explained to munikov and vasili that the
methods of the psychological laboratory would be as
efficacious in picking out a spy as i have many times
proved them to be in convicting the criminal

  every emotion reacts upon the pulse which
strengthens in joy and weakens in sorrow grows
slower with anger faster with despair and as every
slightest variation is detected and registered by the
sphygmograph-i felt certain that if i could test
the three men together by having miss silber tell
her fathers story aloud i could determine conclus-
ively by comparison of the records of the two revolu-
tionists with that of meyan what his sympathies
really were i arranged with them to come here
with me to-night and after meyan had arrived
they went as representatives of the revolutionary
movement to ask his credentials

  when he could furnish none they proposed and
in fact forced him into this test it is a dangerous
thing to endeavor to pass ones self off as a revolu-
tionist and it was safer for him to submit to a test
than to have his mission frustrated by incurring
not only their suspicion but possibly death com-
pletely ignorant of the pitiless powers of psycho-
logical methods and confiding in his steely nerves
which undoubtedly have carried him through many
less searching ordeals he agreed you saw how
perfectly he was able to control his face and every
movement of his body while the test went on but
you can see here trant spread out his strips of
smoked paper on these records which i shall
preserve by passing them through a bath of var-
nish how useless that self-control was since the
sphygmograph recorded by its moving stylus the
hidden feelings of his heart

  as i lay these side by side you can see how
consistently at each point in the story munikov and
vasili experienced the same feelings but meyan had
feelings which were different i did not dream of
course when i started the test that i would dis-
cover in meyan the same man who had betrayed

herman silber it was only when at her first
mention of valerian urth i obtained from meyan
this startling and remarkable record he pointed to
a place where the line suddenly had grown almost
straight and flat that i realized that if the man
before me was not himself urth he at least had
some close and oppressive connection with him

  eva silber had still the note that had been sent
to summon her father on the errand of mercy which
had caused his imprisonment

  she gave it to me before you entered the room

i	was certain that of all men in the world there
was but one who could recognize or feel any emotion
at sight of that yellowed and time-worn paper and
that man was valerian urth who had used it to
betray herman silber

  i showed it to meyan and obtained this really
amazing reaction which ends his record the
psychologist pointed to the record it assured me
that meyan and urth were one

  this is amazing mr trant cuthbert edwards
said but you have left unexplained the most per-
plexing feature of all-the hammering

  to communicate with one another from their
solitary cells russian prisoners long ago devised a
code of spelling letters by knocking upon the wall-a
code widely spread and known by every revolution-
ist it is extremely simple the letters of the alpha-
bet trant took from his pocket a slip of paper
are arranged in this manner

  he set down rapidly the alphabet  omitting two
letters arranged in four lines thus

a	b	c	d	e	f

g	h	i	k		m

n	o p	r	s	t

u	v	w	x y z

  a letter is made the psychologist explained
by giving first the proper number of knocks for
the line a short pause then knocks for the number
of the letter in the line for instance e is one
knock and then five y is four knocks and then five

  by means of this code i translated the figures
in the advertisement and obtained meyans name
and address i presume he used it not only in the
advertisement but at the office because his long
experience had taught him that herman silber as
many another man condemned to the horrors of a
russian prison for a term of years had probably
lost the power of speech and continued to com-
municate in freedom by the means he had used
for so many years in prison

  wonderful mr trant wonderful exclaimed
cuthbert edwards i only regret that we can do
nothing to meyan for there is no law i think by
which he can be punished

  the psychologists face darkened

  vengeance is not ours he answered but i
have given the key of meyans room to munikov
the elder edwards clearing his throat moved
over toward eva and put his arm about her

  since you cannot go back to russia he said
awkwardly will you not let me welcome you into
your place in my home and as the son sprang
swiftly forward and caught his fathers hand trant
took up his instrument cases and went out alone into
the warm april night

rofessor carbonic was diligently
at work in his spacious laboratory
analyzing mixing and experimenting
he had been employed for more than
fifteen years in the same pursuit of
happiness in the same house same laboratory and
attended by the same servant woman a negress
who in her long period of service had attained the

plumpness and respectability of 

two hundred and ninety pounds ---
mag nesia called the pro-
fessor the servants name was
maggie nesia - professor car-
bonic had contracted the title to
save time for in fifteen years he
had not mounted the heights of
greatness he must work harder
and faster as life is short and
eliminate such shameful waste of hihhhshi
time as putting the gie on
maggie

  mag nesia the professor repeated

  the old negress rolled slowly into the room
get rid of these and bring the one the boy
brought today

  he handed her a tray containing three dead rats
whose brains had been subjected to analysis

 in this story like in many other
 satires there will be found a whole
 lot of truth every day brings the
 modern student nearer to the convic-
 tion that the world really is electrical
 in every sense of the word if you
 wish a feiv moments of good enter-
 tainment we recommend this story to
 you

  yes marse answered mag nesia in a tone like
citrate

  the professor busied himself with a new pre-
paration of zinc oxide and copper sulphate and sal
ammoniac his latest concoction which was about
to be used and like its predecessors to be aban-
doned

  mag nesia appeared bringing another rat dead

               the professor made no experi-
ments on live animals he had
hired a boy in the neighborhood
to bring him fresh dead rats at
twenty-five cents per head

  taking the tray he prepared a
hypodermic filled with the new
preparation carefully he made
an incision above the right eye of
the carcass through the bone
he lifted the hypodermic half
hopelessly half expectantly the
old negress watched him as she had done many
times before with always the same pitiful expres-
sion pitiful either for the man himself or for the
dead rat mag nesia seldom expressed her views

  inserting the hypodermic needle and injecting
the contents of the syringe professor carbonic
stepped back




amazing stories

prof carbonic makes a great discovery

ctireat saints his voice could have been
heard a mile slowly the rats tail began to
point skyward and as slowly mag nesia began to
turn white professor carbonic stood as paralyzed
the rat trembled and moved his feet the man of
sixty years made one jump with the alacrity of a
boy of sixteen he grabbed the enlivened animal and
held it high above his head as he jumped about the
room

  spying the negress who until now had seemed un-
able to move he threw both arms around her bring-
ing the rat close to her face around the laboratory
they danced to the tune of the negresss shrieks
the professor held on and the negress yelled up
and down spasmodically on the laboratory floor
came the two hundred and ninety pounds with the
professor thrown in

  bottles tumbled from the shelves furniture was
upset precious liquids flowed unrestrained and
unnoticed finally the professor dropped with ex-
haustion and the rat and mag nesia made a dash
for freedom

  early in the morning pedestrians on arlington
avenue were attracted by a sign in brilliant letters

death is only a disease-it can be cured by
professor paul carbonic

  professor carbonic early in the morning betook
himself to the nearest hardware store and pur-
chased the tools necessary for his new profession
he was an md and his recently acquired knowl-
edge put him in a position to startle the world
having procured what he needed he returned home

  things were developing fast mag nesia met
him at the door and told him that sally soda who
was known to the neighboihood as sal or sal soda
generally had fallen down two flights of stairs and
to use her own words was putty bad sal sodas
mother in sending for a doctor had read the elab-
orate sign of the new enemy of death and begged
that he come to see sal as soon as he returned

  bidding mag nesia to accompany him he went to
the laboratory and secured his precious preparation
professor carbonic and the unwilling mag nesia
started out to put new life into a little sal soda who
lived in the same block

  reaching the house they met the family physician
then attendant on little sal doctor x ray had also
read the sign of the professor and his greeting was
very chilly

  how is the child asked the professor

  fatally hurt and can live but an hour then
he added i have done all that can be done

all that you can do corrected the professor

  with a withering glance doctor x ray left the
room and the house his reputation was such as to
admit of no intrusion

-and the child lives

cct am sorry she is not dead it would be easier

  a to work and also a more reasonable charge
giving mag nesia his instruments he administered
a local anesthetic this done he selected a brace and

bit that he had procured that morning with these
instruments he bored a small hole into the childs
head inserting his hypodermic needle he injected
the immortal fluid then cutting the end off a dowel
which he had also procured that morning he ham-
mered it into the hole until it wedged itself tight

  professor carbonic seated himself comfortably
and awaited the action of his injection while the
plump mag nesia paced or rather waddled the floor
with a bag of carpenters tools under her arm

  the fluid worked the child came to and sat up
sal soda had regained her pep

  it will be one dollar and twenty-five cents mrs
soda apologized the professor i have to make
that charge as it is so inconvenient to work on them
when they are still alive

  having collected his fee the professor and mag
nesia departed amid the ever rising blessings of
the soda family

  at  p m mag nesia sought her employer
who was asleep in the sitting room

  marse paul a gentleman to see you

  the professor awoke and had her send the man
in

  the man entered hurriedly hat in hand are
you professor carbonic

  i am what can i do for you

  can you- the man hesitated my friend

has just been killed in an accident you couldnt
- he hesitated again

  i know that it is unbelievable answered the
professor but i can

a tough case

professor carbonic for some years had suf-
fered from the effects of a weak heart his
fears on this score had recently been entirely re-
lieved he now had the prescription-death no
more the startling discovery and the happenings
of the last twenty-four hours had begun to take ef-
fect on him and he did not wish to make another
call until he was feeling better

  ill go said the professor after a period of
musing my discoveries are for the benefit of the
human race i must not consider myself

  he satisfied himself that he had all his tools he
had just sufficient of the preparation for one in-
jection this he thought would be enough how-
ever he placed in his case two vials of different
solutions which were the basis of his discovery
these fluids had but to be mixed and after the
chemical reaction had taken place the preparation
was ready for use

  he searched the house for mag nesia but the old
servant had made it certain that she did not intend
to act as nurse to dead men on their journey back to
life reluctantly he decided to go without her

  how is it possible exclaimed the stranger as
they climbed into the waiting machine

  i have worked for fifteen years before i found
the solution answered the professor slowly

  i cannot understand on what you could have
based a theory for experimenting on something
that has been universally accepted as impossible of
solution

  with electricity all is possible as i have prov-
advanced chemistry



en seeing the skeptical look his companion as-
sumed he continued electricity is the basis of
every motive power we have it is the base of every
formation that we know the professor was
warming to the subject

  go on said the stranger i am extremely in-
terested

  every sort of heat that is known whether dor-
mant or active is only one arm of the gigantic force
electricity the most of our knowledge of electric-
ity has been gained through its offspring magnet-
ism a body entirely devoid of electricity is a
body dead magnetism is apparent in many things
including the human race and its presence in many
people is prominent

  but how did this lead to your experiments

  if magnetism or motive force is the offspring
of electricity the human body must and does con-
tain electricity that we use more electricity than
the human body will induce is a fact it is appar-
ent therefore that a certain amount of electricity
must be generated within the human body and
without aid of any outside forces science has
known for years that the bodys power is brought
into action through the brain the brain is our
generator the little cells and the fluid that separ-
ate them have the same action as the liquid of a
wet battery like a wet battery this fluid wears out
and we must replace the fluid or the sal ammoniac
or we lose the use of the battery or body i have
discovered what fluid to use that will produce the
electricity in the brain cells which the human body
is unable to induce

  we are here said the stranger as he brought
the car to a stop at the curb

  you are still a skeptic noting the voice of the
man but you shall see shortly

  the man led him into the house and introduced
him to mrs murray attic who conducted him to
the room where the deceased murray attic was
laid

  without a word the professor began his prepar-
ations he was ill and would have preferred to
have been at rest in his own comfortable house
he would do the work quickly and get away

the professor operates on a dead man

selecting a gimlet he bored a hole through
the skull of the dead man inserting his hypo-
dermic he injected all the fluid he had mixed he
had not calculated on the size of the gimlet and
the dowels he canned would not fit the hole as a

last resource he drove in his lead pencil broke it
off close and carefully cut the splinters smooth with
the head

  it will be seventy-five cents madam said the
professor as he finished the work

  mrs murray attic paid the money unconsciously
she did not know whether he was embalming her
husband or just trying the keenness of his new
tools the death had been too much for her

  the minutes passed and still the dead man showed
no signs of reviving professor carbonic paced
the floor in an agitated manner he began to be
doubtful of his ability to bring the man back wor-
ried he continued his tramp up and down the room
his heart was affecting him he was tempted to
return the seventy-five cents to the prostrate wife
when-the dead man moved

  the professor clasped his hands to his throat
and with his head thrown back dropped to the floor
a fatal attack of the heart

  he became conscious quickly the bottles
there he whispered mix- make injection he
became unconscious again

  the stranger found the gimlet and bored a hole
in the professors head hastily seizing one of the
vials he poured the contents into the deeply made
hole he then realized that there was another
bottle

  mix them shrieked the almost hysterical wo-
man

  it was too late the one vial was empty and the
professors body lay lifeless

  in mental agony the stranger grasped the sec-
ond vial and emptied its contents also into the pro-
fessors head and stopped the hole with the cork

  miraculously professor carbonic opened his eyes
and rose to his feet his eyes were like balls of fire
his lips moved inaudibly and as they moved little
blue sparks were seen to pass from one to another
his hair stood out from his head the chemical
reaction was going on in the professors brain with
a dose powerful enough to restore ten men he
tottered slightly

  murray attic now thoroughly alive sat up
straight in bed he grasped the brass bed post with
one hand and stretched out- the other to aid the
staggering man

  he caught his hand both bodies stiffened a
slight crackling sound was audible a blue flash
shot from where attics hand made contact with
the bed post then a dull thud as both bodies struck
the floor both men were electrocuted and the
formula is still a secret

  tyde people of the pit

s u c cmrritl 

i was in movement and sound one with these nameless things  i saw the things under the lights-great transparent snail-like
bodies-dozens of waving tentacles stretching from them    they were like specters of inconceivably monstrous slugs    they

did not crawl or walk-they floated


the people of the pit



orth of us a shaft of light shot half
way to the zenith it came from be-
hind the ragged mountain toward which
we had been pushing all day the
beam drove up through a column of
blue haze whose edges were marked as sharply as
the rain that streams from the edges of a thunder
cloud it was like the flash of a searchlight
through an azure mist and it cast no shadows

  as it struck upward the five summits were out-
lined hard and black and we saw that the whole
mountain was shaped like a hand as the light
silhouetted it the gigantic fingers of the peaks
seemed to stretch the bulk that was the palm of
the hand to push it was exactly as though it
moved to thrust something back the shining beam
held steady for a moment then broke into myriads
of tiny luminous globes that swung to and fro and
dropped gently they seemed to be searching

  the forest had become very still every wood
noise held its breath i felt the dogs pressing
against my legs they too were silent but every
muscle in their bodies trembled their hair was stiff
along their backs and their eyes fixed on the fall-
ing phosphorescent sparks were filmed with the
terror-glaze

  i	looked at starr anderson he was staring at
the north where once more the beam had pulsed up-
ward

   the mountain shaped like a hand  i spoke
without moving my lips my mouth was as dry
as though lao tzai had poured his fear-dust down
my throat

  its the mountain weve been looking for he
answered in the same tone

  but that light-what is it not the aurora
surely i said

  whoever heard of an aurora at this time of the
year

  he voiced the thought that was in my own mind

  it makes me think something is being hunted up
there he said that the lights are seeking-an
unholy sort of hunt-its
well for us to be out of
range

  the mountain seems
to move each time the
shaft shoots up i said

whats it keeping back

starr  it makes me think
of the frozen hand of
cloud that shan nadour
set before the gate of

ghouls to keep them in the lairs that eblis cut for
them

  he raised a hand listening

  from the north and high overhead there came a
whispering it was not the rustling of the aurora
that rushing crackling sound like ghosts of the
winds that blew at creation racing through the
skeleton leaves of ancient trees that sheltered
lilith this whispering held in it a demand it
was eager it called us to come up where the beam
was flashing it-drew

  there was in it a note of inexorable insistence
it touched my heart with a thousand tinjr fear-tip-

 j-j ere is a different story by the well-known
 author a story that deals with intelligences that
 seem almost incomprehensible to our minds we have
 always maintained that it is possible to have intelligence
 in an envelope other than skin flesh and blood

   you will be greatly interested by this exceedingly
 clever story

ped fingers and it filled me with a vast longing to
race on and merge myself in the light it must
have been so that ulysses felt when he strained at
the mast and strove to obey the crystal sweet sing-
ing of the sirens

  the whispering grew louder

  what the hells the matter with those dogs
cried starr anderson savagely look at them
the malemiuts whining were racing away to-
ward the light we saw them disappear among
the trees there came back to us a mournful
howling then that too died away and left noth-
ing but the insistent murmuring overhead

  the glade we had camped in looked straight to
the north we had reached i suppose three hun-
dred miles above the first great bend of the kuskok-
wim toward the yukon certainly we were in an
untrodden part of the wilderness we had pushed
through from dawson at the breaking of the spring
on a fair lead to a lost mountain between the five
peaks of which so the athabascan medicine man
had told us the gold streams out like putty from
a clinched fist

  not an indian were we able to get to go with us
the land of the hand mountain was accursed they
said

  we had sighted a mountain the night before
its ragged top faintly outlined against a pulsing
glow and now by the light that had led us we
saw that it was the very place we had sought

  anderson stiffened through the whispering
had broken a curious pad-pad and a rustling it
sounded as though a small bear were moving to-
ward us

  i	threw a pile of wood on the fire and as it
blazed up saw something break through the
bushes it walked on all fours but it did not walk
like a bear all at once it flashed upon me-it was
like a baby crawling upstairs the forepaws lifted
themselves in grotesquely infantile fashion it
was grotesque but it was-terrible it drew closer
we reached for our guns-and dropped them sud-
denly we knew that this
-----m crawling thing was a man

  it was a man still with
that high climbing pad-
pad he swayed to the fire
he stopped

  safe whispered the
crawling man in a voice
that was an echo of
the whispering overhead
quite safe here they
cant get out of the blue you know they cant get
you-unless you answer them-

  hes mad said anderson and then gently to
this broken thing that had been a man youre all
right-theres nothing after you

  dont answer them repeated the crawling man
the lights i mean

  the lights i cried startled even out of pity
what are they

  the people of the pit he murmured

  he fell upon his side we ran to him ander-
son knelt

  pods love he cried frank look at this


amazing stories

  he pointed to the hands the wrists were covered
with torn rags of a heavy shirt the hands them-
selves were-stumps the fingers had been bent
into the palms and the flesh had been worn to the
bone they looked like the feet of a little
black elephant my eyes traveled down the body
around the waist was a heavy band of yellow metal
from it fell a ring and a dozen links of shining
white chain

  what is he where did he come from said
anderson look hes fast asleep-yet even in
his sleep his arms try to climb and his feet draw
themselves up one after the other and his knees
-how in gods name was he ever able to move on
them

  it was even as he said in the deep sleep that
had come upon the crawler arms and legs kept
raising in a deliberate dreadful climbing motion
it was as though they had a life of their own-they
kept their movement independently of the motion-
less body they were semaphoric motions if you
have ever stood at the back of a train and watched
the semaphores rise and fall you will know exactly
what i mean

  abruptly the overhead whispering ceased the
shaft of light dropped and did not rise again the
crawling man became still a gentle glow began to
grow around us the short alaskan summer night
was over anderson rubbed his eyes and turned
me a haggard face

  man he exclaimed you look as though you
have been sick

  no more than you starr i said that was
riheer stark horror what do you make of it all
im thinking our only answer lies there he
answered pointing to the figure that lay so motion-
less under the blankets we had thrown over him
whatever they were-thats what they were after
there was no aurora about those lights frank
it was like the flaring up of some queer hell the
preacher folk never frightened us with

  well go no further to-day i said i wouldnt
wake him up for all the gold that runs between the
fingers of the five peaks-nor for all the devils
that may be behind them

  the crawling man lay in a sleep as deep as the
styx we bathed and bandaged the pads that had
been his hands arms and legs were as rigid as
though they were crutches he did not move while
we worked over him he lay as he had fallen the
arms a trifle raised the knees bent

  i	began filing the band that ringed the sleepers
waist it was gold but it was like no gold i had
ever handled pure gold is soft this was soft
too-but it had an unclean viscid life of its own

  it clung to the file and i could have sworn that
it writhed like a live thing when i cut into it i
gashed through it bent it away from the body and
hurled it away it was-loathsome

  all that day the crawler slept darkness came
and still he slept but that night there was no
shaft of blue haze from behind the peaks no ques-
tioning globes of light no whispering some spell
of horror seemed withdrawn-but not far both
anderson and i felt that the menace was there
withdrawn perhaps but waiting

  it was noon next day when the crawling man
awoke i jumped as the pleasant drawling voice
sounded

  how long have i slept he said his pale blue
eyes grew quizzical as i stared at him

  a night-and almost two days i said

  were there any lights up there last night ho
nodded to the north eagerly any whispering

  neither i answered his head fell back and
he stared up at the sky

  theyve given it up then he said at last

  who have given it up asked anderson

  and once more-the people of the pit the
crawling man answered

  we stared at him and again faintly i for one
felt that queer maddening desire that the lights
had brought with them

  the people of the pit he repeated things
some god of evil made before the flood and that
somehow have escaped the good gods vengeance
they were calling me he added simply

  anderson and i looked at each other the same
thought in both our minds

  no said the crawling man reading what it
was im not insane give me a very little to
drink im going to die soon will you take me
as far south as you can before i die and after-
wards will you build a fire and burn me i want
to be in such shape that no hellish wile of theirs can
drag my body back to them youll do it when ive
told you about them he said as we hesitated

  he drank the brandy and water we lifted to his
lips

  arms and legs quite dead he said dead as
ill be soon well they did well for me now ill
tell you whats up there behind that hand hell

  listen my name is stanton-sinclair stanton
class  yale explorer i started away from
dawson last year to hunt for five peaks that rose
like a hand in a haunted country and ran pure gold
between them same thing you were after i
thought so late last fall my comrade sickened i
sent him back with some indians a little later my
indians found out what i was after they ran away
from me i decided id stick built a cabin stocked
myself with food and lay down to winter it did
it not badly-it was a pretty mild winter youll
remember in the spring i started off again a
little less than two weeks ago i sighted the five
peaks not from this side though-the other give
me some more brandy

  id made too wide a detour he went on id
gotten too far north i beat back from this side
you see nothing but forest straight up to the base
of the hand over on the other side-

  he was silent for a moment

  over there is forest too but it doesnt reach
so far no i came out of it stretching for miles
in front of me was a level plain it was as worn
and ancient looking as the desert around the broken
shell of babylon at its end rose the peaks be-
tween me and them-far off-was whkt looked like
a low dike of rocks then-i ran across the road

  the road cried anderson incredulously

the road said the crawling man a fine
smooth stone road it ran straight on to the moun-
the people of the pit



tain oh it was a road all right-and worn as
though millions and millions of feet had passed
over it for thousands of years on each side of it
were sand and heaps of stones after a while i be-
gan to notice these stones they were cut and
the shape of the heaps somehow gave me the idea
that a hundred thousand years ago they might have
been the ruins of houses they were as old looking
as that i sensed man about them and at the same
time they smelled of immemorial antiquity

  the peaks grew closer the heaps of ruins
thicker something inexpressibly desolate hovered
over them something sinister something reached
from them that struck my heart like the touch of
ghosts so old that they could be only the ghosts of
ghosts i went on

  and now i saw that what i had thought to be
the low range at the base of the peaks was a thicker
litter of ruins the hand mountain was really much
farther off the road itself passed through these
ruins and between two high rocks that raised them-
selves like a gateway

  the crawling man paused his hands began that
sickening pad-pad again little drops of bloody
sweat showed on his forehead but after a moment
or two he grew quiet he smiled

  they were a gateway he said i reached
them i went between them i sprawled flat clutch-
ing the earth in awe and terror for i was on a
broad stone platform before me was-sheer space
imagine the grand canyon three times as wide
roughly circular and with the bottom dropped out
that would be something like what i was looking
into

  it was like peeping over the edge of a cleft
world down into the infinity where the planets roll
on the far side stood the five peaks they looked
like a gigantic warning hand stretched up to the
sky the lips of the abyss curved away on each
side of me

  i could see down perhaps a thousand feet then
a thick blue haze shut out the eye it was like the
blue you see gather on the high hills at dusk but
the pit-it was awesome awesome as the maoris
gulf of ranalak that sinks between the living and
the dead and that only the freshly released soul
has strength to leap across-but never strength to
leap back again

  i crept back from the verge and stood up weak
shaking my hand rested against one of the rocks
of the gateway there was carving upon it there
in sharp outlines was the heroic figure of a man
his back was turned his arms were stretched
above his head and between them he carried some-
thing that looked like a sun disk with radiating
lines of light there were symbols on the disk
that reminded me of chinese but they were not
chinese no they had been made by hands
dust ages before the chinese stirred in the womb
of time

  i looked at the opposite rock it bore an ex-
actly similar figure there was an odd peaked
head-dress on both the rocks themselves were tri-
angular and the carvings were on the side closest
the pit the gesture of the men seemed to be that
of holding something back-of barring i looked

  closer behind the outstretched hands and the
disks i seemed to see a host of vague shapes and
plainly a multitude of globes

  i traced them out vaguely suddenly i felt
unaccountably sick there had come to me an
impression-i cant call it sight-an impression of
enormous upright slugs their swollen bodies
seemed to dissolve then swim into sight then dis-
solve again-all except the globes which were their
heads and that remained clear they were-un-
utterably loathsome overcome by an inexplicable
and overpowering nausea i stretched myself upon
the slab and then-i saw the stairway that led
down into the pit

  a stairway we cried

  a stairway repeated the crawling man as
patiently as before it seemed not so much carved
out of the rock as built into it each slab was
perhaps twenty feet long and five feet wide they
ran down from the platform and vanished into the
blue haze

  a stairway said anderson incredulously
built into the wall of a precipice and leading down
into a bottomless pit-

  not bottomless interrupted the crawling man
there was a bottom yes i reached it he went
on dully down the stairway-down the stair-
way

  he seemed to grip his mind

  yes he went on firmly i went down the
stairway but not that day i made my camp back
of the gates at dawn i filled my knapsack with
food my two canteens with water from a spring
that wells up there by the gateway walked be-
tween the carved monoliths and stepped over the
edge of the pit

  the steps run along the side of the pit at a
forty degree pitch as i went down and down i
studied them they were of a greenish rock quite
different from the granitic porphyry that formed
the wall of the pit at first i thought that the
builders had taken advantage of an outcropping
stratum and had carved the gigantic flight from it
but the regularity of the angle at which it fell made
me doubtful of this theory

  after i had gone down perhaps half a mile i
stepped out upon a landing from this landing the
stairs made a v-shaped turn and again ran on
downward clinging to the cliff at the same angle
as the first flight after i had made three of these
turns i knew that the steps dropped straight down
to wherever they went in a succession of angles
no strata could be so regular as that no the
stairway was built by hands but whose and
why the answer is in those ruins around the
edge of the pit-never i think to be read

  by noon i had lost sight of the lip of the abyss
above me below me was nothing but the blue haze
beside me too was nothingness for the further
breast of rock had long since vanished in the same
haze i felt no dizziness and no fear only a vast
curiosity what was i to discover some ancient
and wonderful civilization that had ruled when the
poles were tropical gardens a new world the
key to the mystery of man himself  nothing liv-
ing i felt sure-all was too old for life still a


amazing stories

work so wonderful must lead to something quite as
wonderful i knew what was it i went on

  at regular intervals i had passed the mouths of
small caves there would be three thousand steps
and then an opening three thousand steps more and
an opening-and so on and on late that afternoon
i stopped before one of these clefts i suppose i
had gone then three miles down the pit although
the angles were such that i had walked in all
fully ten miles i examined the entrance on each
side was carved the same figures as on the great
portals at the lip of the pit but now they were
standing face forward the arms outstretched with
their disks as though holding something back from
the shaft itself now too their faces were
covered with veils and there were no hideous shapes
behind them

  i went inside the cave it ran back for twenty
yards like a burrow it was dry and perfectly light
i could see outside the blue haze rising upward
like a column i felt an extraordinary sense of se-
curity although i had not been conscious of any
fear i felt that the figures at the entrance were
guardians-but against what i felt so secure that
even curiosity on this point was dulled

  the blue haze thickened and grew faintly
luminescent i fancied that it was dusk above i
ate and drank a little and slept when i awoke the
blue had lightened again and i fancied it was dawn
above i went on i forgot the gulf yawning at my
side i felt no fatigue and little hunger or thirst
although i had drunk and eaten sparingly that
night i spent within another of the caves and at
dawn i descended again

  it was late that day when i first saw the city-

  he was silent for a time

  the city he said at last the city of the pit
but not such a city as you have ever seen-nor
any other man who has lived to tell of it the pit
i think must be shaped like a bottle the opening
before the five peaks is the neck but how wide
the bottom is i do not know-thousands of miles
maybe and what may lie behind the city-i do
not know

  i had begun to catch little glints of light far
down in the blue then i saw the tops of-trees
i suppose they are but not our kind of trees-
unpleasant reptilian trees they reared themselves
on high thin trunks and their tops were nests of
thick tendrils with ugly little leaves like narrow
heads-or snake heads

  the trees were red a vivid angry red here
and there i began to glimpse spots of shining yel-
low i knew these were water because i could see
things breaking through their surface-or at least
i could see the splash and ripple but what it was
that disturbed them i never saw

  straight beneath me was the city mile after
mile of closely packed cylinders that lay upon their
sides in pyramids of three of five-of dozens-
piled upon each other it is so hard to make you
see what that city is like-look suppose you have
water pipes of a certain length and first you lay
three of them side by side and on top of them you
place two and on these two one or suppose you
take five for a foundation and place on these four

and then three then two and then one do you
see that was the way they looked

  and they were topped by towers by minarets
by flares by fans and twisted monstrosities they
gleamed as though coated with pale rose flame be-
side them the venomous red trees raised themselves
like the heads of hydras guarding nests of gigantic
jeweled and sleeping worms

  a few feet beneath me the stairway jutted out
into a titanic arch unearthly as the span that
bridges hell and leads to asgard it curved out and
down straight through the top of the highest pile
of carven cylinders and then-it vanished through
it it was appalling-it was demoniac-

  the crawling man stopped his eyes rolled up
into his head he trembled and again his arms and
legs began their horrible crawling movement
from his lips came a whispering it was an echo
of the high murmuring we had heard the night
he came to us i put my hands over his eyes he
quieted

  the things accursed he said the people of
the pit did i whisper yes-but they cant get
me now-they cant

  after a time he began as quietly as before

  i crossed that span i went down through the
top of that-building blue darkness shrouded me
for a moment and i felt the steps twist into a
spiral i wound down and then i was standing
high up in-i cant tell you what ill have to call
it a room we have no images for what is in the
pit a hundred feet below me was the floor the
walls sloped down and out from where i stood in a
series of widening crescents the place was colos-
sal-and it was filled with a curious mottled red
light it was like the light inside a green
and gold-flecked fire opal the spiral stairs wound
below me i went down to the last step far in
front of me rose a high columned altar its pillars
were carved in monstrous scrolls-like mad octo-
puses with a thousand drunken tentacles they
rested on the backs of shapeless monstrosities
carved in crimson stone the altar front was a
gigantic slab of purple covered with carvings

  i cant describe these carvings no human be-
ing could-the human eye cannot grasp them any
more than it can grasp shapes that haunt the
fourth dimension only a subtle sense in the back
of the brain grasped them vaguely they were
formless things that gave no conscious image yet
pressed into the mind like small hot seals-ideas of
hate-of combat between unthinkable monstrous
things-victories in a nebulous hell of steaming
obscene jungles-aspirations and ideals immeasur-
ably loathsome-

  and as i stood i grew aware of something that
lay behind the lip of the altar fifty feet above me
i knew it was there-i felt it with every hair and
every tiny bit of my skin something infinitely
malignant infinitely horrible infinitely ancient
it lurked it brooded it saw me it threatened and
it-was invisible

  behind me was a circle of blue light some-
thing urged me to turn back to climb the stairs
and make away it was impossible terror of
that unseen watching thing behind the altar raced
the people of the pit



me onward like a whirlwind i passed through the
circle i was in a way that stretched on into dim
distance between the rows of carven cylinders

  here and there the red trees arose between
them rolled the stone burrows and now i could
take in the amazing ornamentation that clothed
them they were like the trunks of smooth skinned
trees that had fallen and had been clothed with
high reaching fantastic orchids yes-those
cylinders were like that-and more they should
have gone out with the dinosaurs they were-
monstrous they struck the eyes like a blow and
they passed across the nerves like a rasp and no-
where was there sight or sound of a living thing

  there were circular openings in the cylinders
like the opening in the temple of the stairway
through which i had run i passed through one of
them i was in a long bare vaulted room whose
curving sides half closed twenty feet over my head
leaving a wide slit that opened into another vaulted
chamber above i saw nothing in the room save
the same mottled reddish light of the temple

  i stumbled still i could see nothing but-my
skin prickled and my heart stopped there was
something on the floor over which i had tripped

  i reached down-and my hand touched a-thing
-cold and smooth-that moved under it-i turned
and ran out of that place i was filled with a sick
loathing that had in it something of madness-i
ran on and on-blindly-wringing my hands-weep-
ing with horror-

  when i came to myself i was still among the
stone cylinders and red trees i tried to retrace
my steps to find the temple for now i was more
than afraid i was like a new soul panic-stricken
with the first terrors of hell but i could not find
the temple and the haze began to thicken and
glow the cylinders to shine more brightly

  suddenly i knew that it was dusk in my own
world above and that the thickening of the haze
was the signal for the awakening of whatever things
lived in the pit

  i scrambled up the sides of one of the burrows
i hid behind a twisted nightmare of stone per-
haps i thought there was a chance of remaining
hidden until the blue lightened the peril passed
and i could escape there began to grow around
me a murmur it was everywhere-and it grew and
grew into a great whispering i peeped from the
side of the stone down into the street

  i saw lights passing and repassing more and
more lights-they swam out of the circular door-
ways and they thronged the street the highest
were eight feet above the pave the lowest perhaps
two they hurried they sauntered they bowed
they stopped and whispered-and there was nothing
under them

  nothing under them breathed anderson

  no he went on that was the terrible part of
it-there was nothing under them yet certainly
the lights were living things they had con-
sciousness volition-what else i did not know they
were nearly two feet across the largest their
center was a bright nucleus-red blue green this
nucleus faded off gradually into a misty glow that
did not end abruptly it too seemed to fade off

into nothingness-but a nothingness that had under
it a-somethingness

  i strained my eyes trying to grasp this body in-
to which the lights merged and which one could
only feel was there but could not see

  and all at once i grew rigid something cold
and thin like a whip had touched my face i turned
my head close behind were three of the lights
they were a pale blue they looked at me-if you
can imagine lights that are eyes

  another whiplash gripped my shoulder under
the closest light came a shrill whispering i
shrieked abruptly the murmuring in the street
ceased

   dragged my eyes from the pale-blue globe
that held them and looked out the lights in the
streets were rising by myriads to the level of
where i stood there they stopped and peered at
me they crowded and jostled as though they were
a crowd of curious people on broadway

  that was the horrible part of it i felt a score
of the lashes touch me-i shrieked again then-
darkness and a sensation of falling through vast
depths

  when i awoke to consciousness i was again in
the great place of the stairway lying at the foot
of the altar all was silent there were no lights
-only the mottled red glow

  i jumped to my feet and ran toward the steps
something jerked me back to my knees and then
i saw that around my waist had been fastened a yel-
low ring of metal from it hung a chain and this
chain passed up over the lip of the high ledge

  i reached into my pockets for my knife to cut
through the ring it was not there i had been
stripped of everything except one of the canteens
that i had hung around my neck and which i sup-
pose they had thought was part of me

  i tried to break the ring it seemed alive it
writhed in my hands and drew itself closer around
me

  i pulled at the chain it was immovable there
came over me in a flood consciousness of the unseen
thing above the altar and i groveled at the foot
of the slab think-alone in that place of strange
light with the brooding ancient horror above me-
a monstrous thing a thing unthinkable-an un-
seen thing that poured forth horror-

  after a while i gripped myself then i saw
beside one of the pillars a yellow bowl filled with
a thick white liquid i drank it if it killed i
did not care but its taste was pleasant and as
i drank strength came back to me with a rush
clearly i was not to be starved the people of the
pit whatever they were had a conception of human
needs

  and now once more the reddish mottled gleam
began to deepen again outside arose the hum-
ming and through the circle that was the entrance
to the temple came streaming the globes they
ranged themselves in ranks until they filled the
temple their whispering grew into a chant a
cadenced whispering chant that rose and fell rose
and fell while to its rhythm the globes lifted and
sank lifted and sank

  all the night the lights came and went and all


amazing stories

that night the chant sounded as they rose and fell
at the last i felt myself only an atom of conscious-
ness in the sea of that whispering an atom that
rose and fell with the bowing globes

  i tell you that even my heart pulsed in unison
with them and the red glow faded the lights
streamed out the whispering died i was again
alone and i knew that again day had begun in my
own world

  i slept when i awoke i found beside the pillar
another bowl of the white liquid i scrutinized the
chain that held me to the altar i began to rub
two of the links together i did this for hours
when the red began to thicken there was a ridge
worn in the links hope rushed up within me
there was then a chance to escape

  with the thickening the lights came again all
through that night the whispering chant sounded
and the globes rose and fell the chant seized me
it pulsed through me until every nerve and muscle
quivered to it my lips began to quiver they
strove like a man trying to cry out in a nightmare
and at last they too were whispering-whispering
the evil chant of the people of the pit my body
bowed in unison with the lights

  i was-god forgive me-in movement and
sound one with these nameless things while my soul
sank back sick with horror but powerless and
as i whispered i-saw theml

  saw the things under the lights great trans-
parent snail-like bodies-dozens of waving tentacles
stretching from them little round gaping mouths
under the luminous seeing globes they were like
specters of inconceivably monstrous slugs and as
i stared still bowing and whispering the dawn
came and they streamed to and through the
entrance they did not crawl or walk-they
floated they floated and were-gone

  i did not sleep i worked all that day at my
chain by the thickening of the red i had worn it
a sixth through and all that night under their
spell i whispered and bowed with the pit people
joining in their chant to the thing that brooded
above me

  twice again the red thickened and lessened and
the chant held me and then on the morning of the
fifth day i broke the worn links i was free i
ran to the stairway with eyes closed i rushed up
and past the unseen horror behind the altar-ledge
and was out upon the bridge i crossed the span
and began the ascent of the stairway

  can you think what it is to climb straight up
the verge of a cleft-world-with hell behind you
well-worse than hell was behind me and terror
rode

  the city of the pit had long been lost in the blue
haze before i knew that i could climb no more
my heart beat upon my ears like a sledge i fell
before one of the little caves feeling that here
at last was sanctuary i crept far back within it
and waited for the haze to thicken almost at once
it did so and from far below me came a vast and
angry murmur crouching at the back of the cave
i saw a swift light go shooting up through the blue
haze then die down and break and as it dimmed
and broke i saw myriads of the globes that are the

eyes of the pit people swing downward into the
abyss again and again the light pulsed and the
globes rose with it and fell

  they were hunting me they knew i must be
somewhere still on the stairway or if hiding be-
low i must some time take to the stairway to es-
cape the whispering grew louder more insistent

  there began to pulse through me a dreadful
desire to join in the whispering as i had done in
the temple something told me that if i did the
sculptured figures could no longer save me that i
would go out and down again into the temple for-
ever i bit my lips through and through to still
them and all that night the beam shot up through
the abyss the globes swung and the whispering
sounded-and i prayed to the power of the caves
and the sculptured figures that still had power to
guard them

  he paused-his strength was going

  then almost in a whisper i thought what
were the people who had carved them why
had they built their city around the verge and
why had they set that stairway in the pit what
had they been to the things that dwelt at the bot-
tom and what use had the things been to them
that they should live beside their dwelling-place
that there had been some purpose was certain no
work so prodigious as the stairway would have been
undertaken otherwise but what was the purpose
and why was it that those who had dwelt about
the abyss had passed away ages gone and the
dwellers in the abyss still lived

  he looked at us i could find no answer i
wonder if even when i am dead i shall know t
doubt it

  dawn came as i wondered and with it-silence
i drank what was left of the liquid in my canteen
crept from the cave and began to climb again
that afternoon my legs gave out i tore off my
shirt and made from it pads for my knees and
coverings for my hands i crawled upward i
crawled up and up and again i crept into one
of the caves and waited until again the blue thick-
ened the shaft of light shot through it and the
whispering came

  but now there was a new note in the whisper-
ing it was no longer threatening it called and
coaxed it-drew

  a terror gripped me there had come upon me
a mighty desire to leave the cave and go out where
the lights swung to let them do with me what
they pleased carry me where they wished the
desire grew it gained fresh impulse with every
rise of the beam until at last i vibrated with the
desire as i had vibrated to the chant in the temple

  my body was a pendulum up would go the
beam and i would swing toward it only my soul
kept steady it held me fast to the floor of the
cave and it placed a hand over my lips to still them
and all that night i fought with my body and lips
against the spell of the pit people

  dawn came again i crept from the cave and
faced the stairway i could not rise my hands
were torn and bleeding my knees an agony i
forced myself upward step by step

  after a while my hands became numb the pain
the people of the pit



left my knees they deadened step by step my
will drove my body upward upon them and time
after time i would sink back within myself to
oblivion-only to wake again and find that all the
time i had been steadily climbing upward

  and then-only a dream of crawling up in-
finite stretches of steps-memories of dull horror
while hidden within caves with thousands of lights
pulsing without and whisperings that called and
called me-memory of a time when i awoke to find
that my body was obeying the call and had carried
me half-way out between the guardians of the por-
tals while thousands of gleaming globes rested in
the blue haze and watched me glimpses of bitter
fights against sleep and always-a climb up and
up along infinite distances of steps that led from a
lost abaddon to a paradise of the blue sky and open
world

  at last a consciousness of clear sky close above
me the lip of the pit before me memory of passing
between the great portals of the pit and of steady
withdrawal from it dreams of giant men with
strange peaked crowns and veiled faces who pushed
me onward and onward and onward and held back
pulsing globules of light that sought to draw me
back to a gulf wherein planets swam between the
branches of red trees that had snakes for crowns

  and then a long long sleep-how long god alone

knows-in a cleft of rocks an awakening to see
far in the north the beam still rising and falling
the lights still hunting the whispering high above
me calling-and knowledge that no longer had they
power to draw me

  again crawling on dead arms and legs that
moved-that moved-like the ancient mariners
ship-without volition of mine and then-your
fire-and this-safety

  the crawling man smiled at us for a moment
then quickly fell asleep

  that afternoon we struck camp and carrying the
crawling man started back south for three days
we carried him and still he slept and on the
third day still sleeping he died we built a great
pile of wood and we burned his body as he had
asked we scattered his ashes about the forest
with the ashes of the trees that had consumed him

  it must be a great magic indeed that can dis-
entangle those ashes and draw them back in a rush-
ing cloud to the pit he called accursed i do not
think that even the people of the pit have such a
spell no

  but anderson and i did not return to the five
peaks to see and if the gold does stream out
between the five peaks of the hand mountain like
putty from a clenched fist-there it may remain
for all of us

he land that time forgot

 byedgarrice burroughs  

    and as  glanced up i saw a most terrific creature swooping down upon me it must have been fully eighty feet long
with an equal spread of wings it was hissing frightfully as it came straight down toward the muzzle of the machine-gun
what went before

rhe teller of this story discovers a quart ther-
 mos bottle turning and twisting in the surf of a
 small island on cape farewell at the southern ex-
 tremity of greenland he rescues it and finds that
 it contains a manuscript neatly written and tightly
 folded which tells the following story

  a young american vrith his airedale nobs
while floating on a raft apparently the lone sur-
vivors of a ship torpedoed by a german submarine
discovers a beautiful young girl seemingly dead
floating on the sea he rescues her she returns to
consciousness and later they both are picked up by
an english vessel soon that vessel also is attacked
by the same submarine but the english captain
tries to maneuver his ship to safety and a battle
ensues the ship sinks but the crew together with
the american and the girl lys la rue gain con-
trol of the submarine and the germans because it
is a german submarine no neutral or friendly boat
will answer their call for help and naturally they
ask for none from a german ship

   benson who later confesses himself a traitor to
 the group manipidates the compass so that they
 swerve far from their intended course and finally find
 themselves near an island which they decide must
 be caprona on account of its tremendous inaces-
 sible cliffs they cannot gain access to the interior
 after much investigation and searching they dis-
 cover what seems a subterranean river they sub-
 merge and soon find themselves in an open interior
 sea because they are in a submarine they are able
 to go with comparative safety past the monstrous

 sea and air reptiles which are plentiful and dan-
 gerous in warmer waters

  they soon come to what seems a good landing
place and an advance party lands to find a good
camping place they meet with a band of beings
closely resembling the neanderthal man who are
quickly scared off by the sound of the dicharging
rifle one a little more highly developed is cap-
tured and brought back to the party they soon
learn something of his language and find him a
great help around the island while they are build-
ing their camp

  later some of the group discover oil and the
germans are permitted to stay on the grounds well
provisioned and with plenty of ammunition while
they are refining the oil when they have enough
for their purposes they surreptitiously return to
the submarine and start for home leaving the
others stranded on the island

  ahm the neanderthal man tells of the evolu-
tion of his people-a process of graduation where-
by each one leaves his tribe and goes to the next
one somewhat higher in the stage of development
when the call comes he expects some day to be-
come a galu-the highest stage most nearly ap-
proximating the civilized man

  one morning lys la rue fails to appear and
ahm has disappeared bowen tyler the young
american alarmed goes to lys room and finds her
gone apparently having been kidnapped he im-
mediately makes preparations to attempt a search
and a rescue

chapter viii

t was a sad leave-taking as in silence
i shook hands with each of the three
remaining men even poor nobs ap-
peared dejected as we quit the com-
pound and set out upon the well-marked
the abductor

spoor of

not once did i turn my
eyes backward toward
fort dinosaur i have
not looked upon it since-
nor in all likelihood shall
i ever look upon it again

the trail led northwest
until it reached the west-
ern end of the sandstone
cliffs to the north of the
fort there it ran into a
well-defined path which

wound northward into a 

country we had not as yet ----
explored it was a beau-
tiful gently rolling country broken by occasional
outcroppings of sandstone and by patches of dense
forest relieved by open parklike stretches and
broad meadows whereon grazed countless herbivor-
ous animals-red deer aurochs and infinite variety
of antelope and at least three distinct species of

 rvo try to give you any idea of the second installment

  in a few lines would be a task akin to giving a resume
 of the history of ancient rome in several paragraphs
 it can not be done burroughs has such a tremendous
 imagination and so many different things happen on
 almost every page that he leaves you bewildered at the
 richness of his imaginative outpouring

   perhaps the outstanding feature in this installment is
 the depiction of evolution which although it taxes our
 credulity nevertheless is not wholly impossible and it
 gives us a pretty good insight into a subject that has been
 much discussed but which has not made much head-
 way thus far

horse the latter ranging in size from a creature
about as large as nobs to a magnificent animal
fourteen to sixteen hands high these creatures
fed together in perfect amity nor did they show
any great indications of terror when nobs and i
approached they moved out of our way and kept

their eyes upon us until
we had passed then they
resumed their feeding

  the path led straight
across the clearing into
another forest lying upon
the verge of which i saw
a bit of white it ap-
peared to stand out in
marked contrast and in-
congruity to all its sur-
roundings and when i
stopped to examine it i
found that it was a small
strip of muslin - part of
the hem of a garment
at once i was all excitement for i knew that it was
a sign left by lys that she had been carried this
way it was a tiny bit torn from the hem of the
undergarment that she wore in lieu of the night-
robes she had lost with the sinking of the liner
crushing the bit of fabric to my lips i pressed




amazing stories

on even more rapidly than before because i now
knew that i was upon the right trail and that up
to this point at least lys still had lived

  i made over twenty miles that day for i was
now hardened to fatigue and accustomed to long-
distance walking having spent considerable time
hunting and exploring in the immediate vicinity
of camp a dozen times that day was my life
threatened by fearsome creatures of the earth or
sky though i could not but note that the farther
north i traveled the fewer were the great dino-
saurs though they still persisted in lesser numbers
on the other hand the quantity of ruminants and
the variety and frequency of carnivorous animals
increased each square mile of caspak harbored its
terrors

  at intervals along the way i found bits of mus-
lin and often they reassured me when otherwise i
should have been doubtful of the trail to take where
two crossed or where there were forks as occurred
at several points and so as night was drawing
on i came to the southern end of a line of cliffs
loftier than any i had seen before and as i ap-
proached them there was wafted to my nostrils
the pungent aroma of wood-smoke what could it
mean there could to my mind be but a single
solution man abided close by a higher order of
man than we had as yet seen other than ahm the
neanderthal man i wondered again as i had so
many times that day if it had not been ahm who
stole lys

  cautiously i approached the flank of the cliffs
where they terminated in an abrupt escarpment as
though some all powerful hand had broken off a
great section of rock and set it upon the surface of
the earth it was now quite dark and as i crept
around the edge of the cliff i saw at a little dis-
tance a great fire around which were many figures
-apparently human figures cautioning nobs to
silence and he had learned many lessons in the
value of obedience since we had entered caspak i
slunk forward taking advantage of whatever cover
i could find until from behind a bush i could dis-
tinctly see the creatures assembled by the fire
they were human and yet not human i should
say that they were a little higher in the scale of
evolution than ahm possibly occupying a plane of
evolution between that of the neanderthal man and
what is known as the grimaldi race their fea-
tures were distinctly negroid though their skins
were white a considerable portion of both torso
and limbs was covered with short hair and their
physical proportions were in many respects apelike
though not so much so as were ahms they car-
ried themselves in a more erect position although
their arms were considerably longer than those of
the neanderthal man as i watched them i saw
that they possessed a language that they had
knowledge of fire and that they carried besides the
wooden club of ahm a thing which resembled a
crude stone hatchet evidently they were very low
in the scale of humanity but they were a step up-
ward from those i had previously seen in caspak

  lys is found-an attack and a deadly shot

but what interested me most was the slender
figure of a dainty girl clad only in a thin bit
of muslin which scarce covered her knees-a bit

of muslin torn and ragged about the lower hem
it was lys and she was alive and so far as i could
see unharmed a huge brute with thick lips and
prognathous jaw stood at her shoulder he was
talking loudly and gesticulating wildly i was close
enough to hear his words which were similar to
the language of ahm though much fuller for
there were many words i could not understand
however i caught the gist of what he was saying
-which in effect was that he had found and cap-
tured this galu that she was his and that he defied
anyone to question his right of possession it ap-
peared to me as i afterward learned was the fact
that i was witnessing the most primitive of mar-
riage ceremonies the assembled members of the
tribe looked on and listened in a sort of dull and
perfunctory apathy for the speaker was by far
the mightiest of the clan there seemed no one to
dispute his claims when he said or rather shouted
in stentorian tones i am tsa this is my she
who wishes her more than tsa

  i do i said in the language of ahm and i
stepped out into the firelight before them lys
gave a little cry of joy and started toward me but
tsa grasped her arm and dragged her back

  who are you shrieked tsa i kill i kill
i kill

  the she is mine i replied and i have come to
claim her i kill if you do not let her come to
me and i raised my pistol to a level with his
heart of course the creature had no conception
of the purpose of the strange little implement
which i was poking toward him with a sound
that was half human and half the growl of a wild
beast he sprang toward me i aimed at his heart
and fired and as he sprawled headlong to the
ground the others of his tribe overcome by fright
at the report of the pistol scattered toward the
cliffs-while lys with outstretched arms ran
toward me

  as i crushed her to me there rose from the
black night behind us and then to our right and
to our left a series of frightful screams and
shrieks bellowings roars and growls it was the
night-life of this jungle world coming into its own
-the huge carnivorous nocturnal beasts which
make the nights of caspak hideous a shuddering
sob ran through lys figure o god she cried
give me the strength to endure for his sake i
saw that she was upon the verge of a breakdown
after all that she must have passed through of
fear and horror that day and i tried to quiet and
reassure her as best i might but even to me the
future looked most unpromising for what chance
of life had we against the frightful hunters of
the night who even now were prowling closer to us

  now i turned to see what had become of the
tribe and in the fitful glare of the fire i perceived
that the face of the cliff was pitted with large holes
into which the man-things were clambering
come i said to lys we must follow them we
cannot last a half-hour out here we must find a
cave already we could see the blazing green eyes
of the hungry carnivora i seized a brand from
the fire and hurled it out into the night and there
came back an answering chorus of savage and
rageful protest but the eyes vanished for a short
time selecting a burning branch for each of us
the land that time forgot



we advanced toward the cliffs where we were met
by angry threats

  they will kill us said lys we may as well
keep on in search of another refuge

  they will not kill us so surely as will those
others out there i replied i am going to seek
shelter in one of these caves nor will the man-
things prevent and i kept on in the direction
of the cliffs base a huge creature stood upon a
ledge and brandished his stone hatchet come
and i will kill you and take the she he boasted

  you saw how tsa fared when he would have
kept my she i replied in his own tongue thus
will you fare and all your fellows if you do not
permit us to come in peace among you out of the
dangers of the night

  go north he screamed go north among the
galus and we will not harm you some day will
we be galus but now we are not you do not
belong among us go away or we will kill you
the she may remain if she is afraid and we will
keep her but the he must depart

  the he wont depart i replied and approached
still nearer rough and narrow ledges formed by
nature gave access to the upper caves a man
might scale them if unhampered and unhindered
but to clamber upward in the face of a belligerent
tribe of half-men and with a giil to assist was
beyond my capability

  i do not fear you screamed the creature you
were close to tsa but i am far above you you
cannot harm me as you harmed tsa go away

cave dwellers

i placed a foot upon the lowest ledge and
clambered upward reaching down and pulling
lys to my side already i felt safer soon we
would be out of danger of the beasts again closing
in upon us the man above us raised his stone
hatchet above his head and leaped lightly down to
meet us his position above me gave him a great
advantage or at least so he probably thought for
he came with every show of confidence i hated
to do it but there seemed no other way and so i
shot him down as i had shot down tsa

  you see i cried to his fellows that i can
kill you wherever you may be a long way off i
can kill you as well as i can kill you near by let
us come among you in peace i will not harm you
if you do not harm us we will take a cave high
up speak

  come then said one if you will not harm
us you may come take tsas hole which lies
above you

  the creature showed us the mouth of a black
cave but he kept at a distance while he did it
and lys followed me as i crawled in to explore i
had matches with me and in the light of one i
found a small cavern with a flat roof and floor
which followed the cleavage of the strata pieces
of the roof had fallen at some long-distant date
as was evidenced by the depth of the filth and
rubble in which they were embedded even a
superficial examination revealed the fact that
nothing had ever been attempted that might have
improved the habitability of the cave nor should
i judge had it ever been cleaned out with con-
siderable difficulty i loosened some of the larger

pieces of broken rock which littered the floor and
placed them as a barrier before the doorway it
was too dark to do more than this i then gave
lys a piece of dried meat and sitting inside the
entrance we dined as must have some of our an-
cient forbears at the dawning of the age of man
while from below the open diapason of the savage
night rose weird and horrifying to our ears in
the light of the great fire still burning we could
see huge skulking forms and in the blacker back-
ground countless flaming eyes

  lys shuddered and i put my arm around her
and drew her to me and thus we sat throughout
the hot night she told me of her abduction and
of the fright she had undergone and together we
thanked god that she had come through unharmed
because the great brute had not dared to pause
along the danger-infested way she said that they
had but just reached the cliffs when i arrived for
on several occasions her captor had been forced
to take to the trees with her to escape the clutches
of some hungry cave-lion or saber-tooth tiger and
that twice they had been obliged to remain for
considerable periods before the beasts had retired

  nobs by dint of much scrambling and one or
two narrow escapes from death had managed to
follow us up the cliff and was now curled between
me and the doorway having devoured a piece of
the dried meat which he seemed to relish im-
mensely he was the first to fall asleep but i
imagine we must have followed suit soon for we
were both tired i had laid aside my ammunition-
belt and rifle though both were close beside me
but my pistol i kept in my lap beneath my hand
however we were not disturbed during the night
and when i awoke the sun was shining on the
tree-tops in the distance lys head had drooped
to my breast and my arm was still about her

  shortly afterward lys awoke and for a moment
she could not seem to comprehend her situation
she looked at me and then turned and glanced at
my arm about her and then she seemed quite sud-
denly to realize the scantiness of her apparel and
drew away covering her face with her palms and
blushing furiously i drew her back toward me
and kissed her and then she threw her arms about
tny neck and wept softly in mute surrender to the
inevitable

the bathers

it was an hour later before the tribe began to
stir about we watched them from our
apartment as lys called it neither men nor
women wore any sort of clothing or ornaments
and they all seemed to be abdut of an age nor
were there any babies or children among them
this was to us the strangest and most inexplic-
able of facts but it recalled to us that though we
had seen many of the lesser developed wild people
of caspak we had never yet seen a child or an old
man or old woman

  after a while they became less suspicious of us
and then quite friendly in their brutish way they
picked at the fabric of our clothing which seemed
to interest them and examined my rifle and pistol
and the ammunition in the belt around my waist
i showed them the thermos-bottle and when i
poured a little water from it they were delighted


amazing stories

thinking that it was a spring which i carried about
with me-a never-failing source of water supply

  one thing we both noticed among their other
characteristics they never laughed or smiled
and then we remembered that ahm had never done
so either i asked them if they knew ahm but
they said they did not

one of them said back there we may have
known him and he jerked his head to the south

  you came from back there i asked he
looked at me in surprise

  we all come from there he said after a
while we go there and this time he jerked his
head toward the north be galus he concluded

  many times now had we heard this reference to
becoming galus ahm had spoken of it many
times lys and i decided that it was a sort of
original religious conviction as much a part of
them as their instinct for self-preservation-a
primal acceptance of a hereafter and a holier state
it was a brilliant theory but it was all wrong i
know it now and how far we were from guessing
the wonderful the miraculous the gigantic truth
which even yet i may only guess at-the thing
that sets caspak apart from all the rest of the
world far more definitely than her isolated geo-
graphic position or her impregnable barrier of
giant cliffs if i could live to return to civilization

i should have meat for the clergy and the layman
to chew upon for years-and for the evolutionists
too

  after breakfast the men set out to hunt while
the women went to a large pool of warm water
covered with a green scum and filled with billions
of tadpoles they waded in to where the water
was about a foot deep and lay down in the mud
they remained there from one to two hours and
then returned to the cliff while we were with
them we saw this same thing repeated every morn-
ing but though we asked them why they did it we
could get no reply which was intelligible to us
all they vouchsafed by way of explanation was the
single word ata they tried to get lys to go in
with them and could not understand why she re-
fused after the first day i went hunting with
the men leaving my pistol and nobs with lys
but she never had to use them for no reptile or
beast ever approached the pool while the women
were there-nor so far as we know at other times
there was no spoor of wild beast in the soft mud
along the banks and the water certainly didnt look
fit to drink

  this tribe lived largely upon the smaller ani-
mals which they bowled over with their stone
hatchets after making a wide circle about their
quarry and driving it so that it had to pass close
to one of their number the little horses and the
smaller antelope they secured in sufficient numbers
to support life and they also ate numerous vari-
eties of fruits and vegetables they never brought
in more than sufficient food for their immediate
needs but why bother the food problem of
caspak is not one to cause worry to her inhabitants

lost in caspak a recent grave

the fourth day lys told me that she thought
she felt equal to attempting the return journey
on the morrow and so i set out for the hunt in

high spirits for i was anxious to return to the
fort and learn if bradley and his party had re-
turned and what had been the result of his expe-
dition i also wanted to relieve their minds as to
lys and myself as i knew that they must already
have given us up for dead it was a cloudy day
though warm as it always is in caspak it seemed
odd to realize that just a few miles away winter
lay upon the storm-tossed ocean and that snow
might be falling all about caprona but no snow
could ever penetrate the damp hot atmosphere of
the great crater

  we had to go quite a bit farther than usual be-
fore we could surround a little bunch of antelope
and as i was helping drive them i saw a fine red
deer a couple of hundred yards behind me he
must have been asleep in the long grass for i saw
him rise and look about him in a bewildered way
and then i raised my gun and let him have it he
dropped and i ran forward to finish him with the
long thin knife which one of the men had given
me but just as i reached him he staggered to
his feet and ran on for another two hundred yards
-when i dropped him again once more was this
repeated before i was able to reach him and cut
his throat then i looked around for my com
panions as i wanted them to come and carry the
meat home but i could see nothing of them i
called a few times and waited but there was no
response and no one came at last i became dis-
gusted and cutting off all the meat that i could
conveniently carry i set off in the direction of the
cliffs i must have gone about a mile before the
truth dawned upon me-i was lost hopelessly lost

  the entire sky was still completely blotted out
by dense clouds nor was there any landmark vis-
ible by which i might have taken my bearings i
went on in the direction i thought was south but
which i now imagine must have been about due
north without detecting a single familiar object
in a dense wood i suddenly stumbled upon a thing
which at first filled me with hope and later with
the most utter despair and dejection it was a
little mound of new-turned earth sprinkled with
flowers long since withered and at one end was a
flat slab of standstone stuck in the ground it was
a grave and it meant for me that i had at last
stumbled into a country inhabited by human be-
ings i would find them they would direct me to
the cliffs perhaps they would accompany me and
take us back with them to their abodes-to the
abodes of men and women like ourselves my
hopes and my imagination ran riot in the few yards
i had to cover to reach that lonely grave and stoop
that i might read the rude characters scratched
upon the simple headstone this is what i read

here lies john tippet
englishman
killed by tyrannosaurus
 sep a d 
r i p

  tippet it seemed incredible tippet lying
here in this gloomy wood tippet dead he had
been a good man but the personal loss was not
what affected me it was the fact that this silent
grave gave evidence that bradley had come this
the land that time forgot



far upon his expedition and that he too probably
was lost for it was not our intention that he should
be long gone if i had stumbled upon the grave
of one of the party was it not within reason to
believe that the bones of the others lay scattered
gomewhere near

chapter ix

as i stood looking down upon that sad and
lonely mound wrapped in the most dismal
of reflections and premonitions i was sud-
denly seized from behind and thrown to earth as
i fell a warm body fell on top of me and hands
grasped my arms and legs when i could look up
i saw a number of giant figures pinioning me down
while others stood about surveying me here
again was a new type of man-a higher type than
the primitive tribe i had just quitted they were
a taller people too with better-shaped skulls and
more intelligent faces there were less of the ape
characteristics about their features and less of the
negroid too they carried weapons stone-shod
spears stone knives and hatchets-and they wore
ornaments and breechcloths-the former of feathers
worn in their hair and the latter made of a single
snake-skin cured with the head on the head de-
pending to their knees

  of course i did not take in all these details upon
the instant of my capture for i was busy with
other matters three of the warriors were sitting
upon me trying to hold me down by main strength
and awkwardness and they were having their
hands full in the doing i can tell you i dont like
to appear conceited but i may as well admit that
i am proud of my strength and the science i have
acquired and developed in the directing of it-that
and my horsemanship i always have been proud of
and now that day all the long hours that i had
put into careful study practice and training
brought me in two or three minutes a full return
upon my investment californians as a rule are
familiar with ju-jutsu and i especially had made
a study of it for several years both at school and
in the gym of the los angeles athletic club while
recently i had had in my employ a jap who was
a wonder at the art

  it took me just about thirty seconds to break
the elbow of one of my assailants trip another
and send him stumbling backward among his fel-
lows and throw the third completely over my head
in such a way that when he fell his neck was broken
in the instant that the others of the party stood
in mute and inactive surprise i unslung my rifle
-which carelessly i had been carrying across my
back and when they charged as i felt they would
i put a bullet in the forehead of one of them this
stopped them all temporarily-not the death of
their fellow but the report of the rifle the first
they had ever heard before they were ready to
attack me again one of them spoke in a command-
ing tone to his fellows in a language similar to
but still more comprehensive than that of the tribe
to the south as theirs was more complete than
ahms he commanded them to stand back and
then he advanced and addressed me

  he asked me who i was from whence i came
and what my intentions were i replied that i was
a stranger in caspak that i was lost and that my

only desire was to find my way back to my com-
panions he asked where they were and i told
him toward the south somewhere using the cas-
pakian phrase which literally translated means
toward the beginning his surprise showed
upon his face before he voiced it in words there
are no galus there he said you have lied the
galus have turned you out

  i tell you i said angrily that i am from an-
other country far from caspak far beyond the
high cliffs i do not know who the galus may be
i have never seen them this is the farthest north
i have been look at me-look at my clothing and
my weapons have you ever seen a galu or any
other creature in caspak who possessed such
things

  he had to admit that he had not and also that
he was much interested in me my rifle and the
way i had handled his three warriors finally he
became half convinced that i was telling him the
truth and offered to aid me if i would show him
how i had thrown the man over my head and also
make him a present of the bang-spear as he
called it i refused to give him my rifle but prom-
ised to show him the trick he wished to learn if he
would guide me in the right direction he told me
that he would do so tomorrow that it was too late
today and that i might come to their village and
spend the night with them i was loath to lose so
much time but the fellow was obdurate and so i
accompanied them the two dead men they left
where they had fallen nor gave them a second
glance-thus cheap is life upon caspak

  tracing the evolution of the races of man

these people also were cave-dwellers but
their caves showed the result of a higher intel-
ligence that brought them a step nearer to civilized
man than the tribe next toward the beginning
the interiors of their caverns were cleared of rub-
bish though still far from clean and they had
pallets of dried grasses covered with the skins of
leopard lynx and bear while before the entrances
were barriers of stone and small rudely circular
stone ovens the walls of the cavern to which i was
conducted were covered with drawings scratched
upon the sandstone there were the outlines of
giant red deer of mammoths of tigers and other
beasts here as in the last tribe there were no
children or any old people the men of this tribe
had two names or rather names of two syllables
and their language contained words of two syl-
lables  whereas in the tribe of tsa the words were
all of a single syllable with the exception of a very
few like atis and gcdus the chiefs name was
to-jo and his household consisted of seven females
and himself these women were much more
comely or rather less hideous than those of tsas
people one of them even was almost pretty being
less hairy and having a rather nice skin with high
coloring

  they were all much interested in me and exam-
ined my clothing and equipment carefully han-
dling and feeling and smelling of each article i
learned from them that their people were known
as band-lu or spear-men tsas race was called
sto-lu-hatchet-men below these in the scale of
evolution came the bo-lu or club-men and then the


amazing stories

alus who had no weapons and no language in
that word i recognized what to me seemed the most
remarkable discovery i had made upon caprona
for unless it were mere coincidence i had come
upon a word that had been handed down from the
beginning of spoken language upon earth been
handed down for millions of years perhaps with
little change it was the sole remaining thread
of the ancient woof of a dawning culture which
had been woven when caprona was a fiery mount
upon a great land-mass teeming with life it
linked the unfathomable then to the eternal now
and yet it may have been pure coincidence my
better judgment tells me that it is coincidence that
in caspak the term for speechless man is alus and
in the outer world of our own today it is alalus
borrowed from the greek by haeckel

  the comely woman of whom i spoke was called
so-ta and she took such a lively interest in me
that to-jo finally objected to her attentions em-
phasizing his displeasure by knocking her down and
kicking her into a corner of the cavern i leaped
between them while he was still kicking her and
obtaining a quick hold upon him dragged him
screaming with pain from the cave there i made
him promise not to hurt the she again upon pain
of worse punishment so-ta gave me a grateful
look but to-jo and the balance of his women were
sullen and ominous

  later in the evening so-ta confided to me that
she was soon to leave the tribe

  so-ta soon be kro-lu she confided in a low
whisper i asked her what a kro-lu might be and
she tried to explain but i do not yet know if i
understood her from her gestures i deduced that
the kro-lus were a people who were armed with
bows and arrows had vessels in which to cook their
food and huts of some sort in which they lived
and were accompanied by animals it was all very
fragmentary and vague but the idea seemed to be
that the kro-lus were a more advanced people than
the band-lus i pondered a long time upon all that
i had heard before sleep came to me i tried to
find some connection between these various races
that would explain the universal hope which each
of them harbored that some day they would be-
come galus so-ta had given me a suggestion but
the resulting idea was so weird that i could scarce
even entertain it yet it coincided with ahms ex-
pressed hope with the various steps in evolution
i had noted in the several tribes i had encoun-
tered and with the range of type represented in
each tribe for example among the band-lu were
such types as so-ta who seemed to me to be the
highest in the scale of evolution and to-jo who
was just a shade nearer the ape while there were
others who had flatter noses faces more progna-
thous and hairier bodies the question puzzled
me possibly in the outer world the answer to
it is locked in the bosom of the sphinx who
knows i do not

  thinking the thoughts of a lunatic or a dope-
fiend i fell asleep and when i awoke my hands
and feet were securely tied and my weapons had
been taken from me how they did it without
awakening me i cannot tell you it was humil-
iating but it was true to-jo stood above me

the early light of morning was dimly filtering
into the cave

         a prisoner and an escape
utell me he demanded how to throw a
a man over my head and break his neck for
i am going to kill you and i wish to know this
thing before you die

  of all the ingenuous declarations i have ever
heard this one copped the proverbial bun it
struck me as so funny that even in the face of
death i laughed death i may remark here had
however lost much of its terror for me i had
become a disciple of lys fleeting philosophy of
the valuelessness of human life i realized that
she was quite right-that we were but comic fig-
ures hopping from the cradle to the grave of in-
terest to practically no other created thing than
ourselves and our few intimates

  behind to-jo stood so-ta she raised one hand
with the palm toward me-the caspakian equiva-
lent of a negative shake of the head

  let me think about it i parried and to-jo
said that he would wait until night he would
give me a day to think it over then he left and
the women left-the men for the hunt and the
women as i later learned from so-ta for the
warm pool where they immersed their bodies as
did the shes of the sto-lu ata explained so-ta
when i questioned her as to the purpose of this
matutinal rite but that was later

  i must have lain there bound and uncomfort-
able for two or three hours when at last so-ta
entered the cave she carried a sharp knife-
mine in fact and with it she cut my bonds

  come she said so-ta will go with you back
to the galus it is time that so-ta left the
band-lu together we will go to the kro-lu and
after that the galus to-jo will kill you tonight
he will kill so-ta if he knows that so-ta aided
you we will go together

  i will go with you to the kro-lu i replied
but then i must return to my own people toward
the beginning 

  you cannot go back she said it is for-
bidden they would kill you thus far have you
come-there is no returning

  but i must return i insisted my people
are there i must return and lead them in this
direction

  she insisted and i insisted but at last we com-
promised i was to escort her as far as the
country of the kro-lu and then i was to go back
after my own people and lead them north into a
land where the dangers were fewer and the people
less murderous she brought me all my belong-
ings that had been filched from me-rifle ammu-
nition knife and thermos bottle and then hand in
hand we descended the cliff and set off toward the
north

  for three days we continued upon our way until
we arrived outside a village of thatched huts just
at dusk so-ta said that she would enter alone
i must not be seen if i did not intend to remain
as it was forbidden that one should return and live
after having advanced this far so she left me
she was a dear girl and a stanch and true comrade
-more like a man than a woman in her simple
the land that time forgot



barbaric way she was both refined and chaste she
had been the wife of to-jo among the kro-lu she
would find another mate after the manner of the
strange caspakian world but she told me very
frankly that whenever i returned she would leave
her mate and come to me as she preferred me above
all others i was becoming a ladies man after a
lifetime of bashfulness

   at the outskirts of the village i left her without
even seeing the sort of people who inhabited it and
set off through the growing darkness toward the
south on the third day i made a detour westward
to avoid the country of the band-lu as i did not
care to be detained by a meeting with to-jo on
the sixth day i came to the cliffs of the sto-lu and
my heart beat fast as i approached them for here
was lys soon i would hold her tight in my arms
again soon her warm lips would merge with mine

i felt sure that she was still safe among the hatchet
people and i was already picturing the joy and the
love-light in her eyes when she should see me once
more as i emerged from the last clump of trees
and almost ran toward the cliffs

another grave

it was late in the morning the women must
have returned from the pool yet as i drew near

i saw no sign of life whatever they have re-
mained longer i thought but when i was quite
close to the base of the cliffs i saw that which
dashed my hopes and my happiness to earth
strewn along the ground were a score of mute and
horrible suggestions of what had taken place dur-
ing my absence-bones picked clean of flesh the
bones of manlike creatures the bones of many of
the tribe of sto-lu and in no cave was there sign
of life

  closely i examined the ghastly remains fearful
each instant that i should find the dainty skull that
would shatter my happiness for life but though 
searched diligently picking up every one of the
twenty-odd skulls i found none that was not the
skull of a creature but slightly removed from the
ape hope then still lived for another three
days i searched north and south east and west for
the hatchet-men of caspak but never a trace of
them did i find it was raining most of the time
now and the weather wap as near cold as it ever
seems to get on caprona

   at last i gave up the search and set off toward
fort dinosaur for a week-a week filled with the
terrors and dangers of a primeval world-i pushed
on in the direction i thought was south the sun
never shone the rain scarcely ever ceased falling
the beasts i met with were fewer in number but
infinitely more terrible in temper yet i lived on
until there came to me the realization that i was
hopelessly lost that a year of sunshine would not
again give me my bearings and while i was cast
down by this terrifying knowledge the knowledge
that i never again could find my lys i stumbled
upon another grave-the grave of william james
with its little crude headstone and its scrawled
characters recording that he had died upon the th
of september-killed by a saber-tooth tiger

   i think that i almost gave up then never in my
life have i felt more hopeless or helpless or alone

i was lost i could not find my friends i did not
even know that they still lived in fact i could not
bring myself to believe that they did i was sure
that lys was dead i wanted myself to die and
yet i clung to life-useless and hopeless and har-
rowing a thing as it had become i clung to life
because some ancient reptilian forbear had clung
to life and transmitted to me through the ages the
most powerful motive that guided his minute brain
-the motive of self-preservation

  at last i came to the great barrier-cliffs and
after three days of mad effort-of maniacal effort
-i scaled them i built crude ladders i wedged
sticks in narrow fissures i chopped toe-holds and
finger-holds with my long knife but at last i scaled
them near the summit i came upon a huge cav-
ern it is the abode of some mighty winged crea-
ture of the triassic-or rather it was now it is
mine i slew the thing and took its abode i
reached the summit and looked out upon the broad
gray terrible pacific of the far-southern winter
it was cold up there it is cold here today yet
here i sit watching watching watching for the
thing i know will never come-for a sail

chapter x

once a day i descend to the base of the cliff
and hunt and fill my stomach with water
from a clear cold spring i have three
gourds which i fill with water and take back to
my cave against the long nights i have fashioned
a spear and a bow and arrow that i may conserve
my ammunition which is running low my clothes
are worn to shreds tomorrow i shall discard them
for leopard-skins which i have tanned and sewn
into a garment strong and warm it is cold up
here i have a fire burning and i sit bent over it
while i write but i am safe here no other living
creature ventures to the chill summit of the barrier
cliffs i am safe and i am alone with my sorrows
and my remembered joys-but without hope it is
said that hope springs eternal in the human breast
but there is none in mine

  i am about done presently i shall fold these
pages and push them into my thermos bottle i
shall cork it and screw the cap down tight and then
i shall hurl it as far out into the sea as my strength
will permit the wind is off-shore the tide is run-
ning out perhaps it will be carried into one of
those numerous ocean-currents which sweep per-
petually from pole to pole and from continent to
continent to be deposited at last upon some inhab-
ited shore if fate is kind and this does happen
then for gods sake come and get me

  it was a week ago that i wrote the preceding
paragraph which i thought would end the written
record of my life upon caprona i had paused to
put a new point on my quill and stir the crude ink
which i made by crushing a black variety of berry
and mixing it with water before attaching my
signature when faintly from the valley below came
an unmistakable sound which brought me to my
feet trembling with excitement to peer eagerly
downward from my dizzy ledge how full of mean-
ing that sound was to me you may guess when i
tell you that it was the report of a firearm for
a moment my gaze traversed the landscape beneath
until it was caught and held by four figures near


amazing stories

the base of the cliff-a human figure held at bay
by three hyaenodons those ferocious and blood-
thirsty wild dogs of the eocene a fourth beast
lay dead or dying near by

  i couldnt be sure looking down from above as
i was but yet i trembled like a leaf in the intuitive
belief that it was lys and my judgment served to
confirm my wild desire for whoever it was carried
only a pistol and thus had lys been armed the
first wave of sudden joy which surged through me
was short-lived in the face of the swift-following
conviction that the one who fought below was
already doomed luck and only luck it must have
been which had permitted that first shot to lay
low one of the savage creatures for even such a
heavy weapon as my pistol is entirely inadequate
against even the lesser carnivora of caspak in a
moment the three would charge a futile shot would
but tend more greatly to enrage the one it chanced
to hit and then the three would drag down the
little human figure and tear it to pieces

  and maybe it was lys my heart stood still at
the thought but mind and muscle responded to the
quick decision i was forced to make there was
but a single hope-a single chance-and i took it
i raised my rifle to my shoulder and took careful
aim it was a long shot a dangerous shot for
unless one is accustomed to it shooting from a con-
siderable altitude is most deceptive work there
is though something about marksmanship which is
quite beyond all scientific laws

  upon rio other theory can i explain my marks-
manship of that moment three times my rifle
spoke-three quick short syllables of death i did
not take conscious aim and yet at each report a
beast crumpled in its tracks

  from my ledge to the base of the cliff is a matter
of several thousand feet of dangerous climbing
yet i venture to say that the first ape from whose
loins my line has descended never could have
equaled the speed with which i literally dropped
down the face of that rugged escarpment the last
two hundred feet is over a steep incline of
loose rubble to the valley bottom and i had just
reached the top of this when there arose to my ears
an agonized cry-bowen bowen quick my love
quick

lys found and in danger

had been too much occupied with the dangers
of the descent to glance down toward the valley
but that cry which told me that it was indeed lys
and that she was again in danger brought my eyes
quickly upon her in time to see a hairy burly
brute seize her and start off at a run toward the
near-by wood from rock to rock chamoislike i
leaped downward toward the valley in pursuit of
lys and her hideous abductor

  he was heavier than i by many pounds and so
weighted by the burden he carried that i easily
overtook him and at last he turned snarling to
face me it was kho of the tribe of tsa the
hatchet-men he recognized me and with a low
growl he threw lys aside and came for me the
she is mine he cried i kill i kill

  i had to discard my rifle before i commenced the
rapid descent of the cliff so that now i was armed
only with a hunting knife and this i whipped from

its scabbard as kho leaped toward me he was a
mighty beast mightily muscled and the urge that
has made males fight since the dawn of life on earth
filled him with blood-lust and the thirst to slay
but not one whit less did it fill me with the same
primal passions two abysmal beasts sprang at
each others throats that day beneath the shadow of
earths oldest cliffs-the man of now and the man-
thing of the earliest forgotten then imbued by
the same deathless passion that has come down un-
changed through all the epochs periods and eras
of time from the beginning and which shall con-
tinue to the incalculable end-woman the im-
perishable alpha and omega of life

  kho closed and sought my jugular with his teeth
he seemed to forget the hatchet dangling by its
aurochs-hide thong at his hip as i forgot for the
moment the dagger in my hand and i doubt not
but that kho would easily have bested me in an
encounter of that sort had not lys voice awakened
within my momentarily reverted brain the skill
and cunning of reasoning man bowen she
cried your knife your knife

  it was enough it recalled me from the forgotten
eon to which my brain had flown and left me once
again a modern man battling with a clumsy un-
skilled brute no longer did my jaws snap at the
hairy throat before me but instead my knife
sought and found a space between two ribs over
the savage heart kho voiced a single horrid
scream stiffened spasmodically and sank to the
earth and lys threw herself into my arms all
the fears and sorrows of the past were wiped away
and once again i was the happiest of men

  with some misgivings i shortly afterward cast
my eyes upward toward the precarious ledge which
ran before my cave for it seemed to me quite
beyond all reason to expect a dainty modern belle
to essay the perils of that frightful climb i asked
her if she thought she could brave the ascent and
she laughted gayly in my face

  watch she cried and ran eagerly toward the
base of the cliff like a squirrel she clambered
swiftly aloft so that i was forced to exert myself
to keep pace with her at first she frightened me
but presently i was aware that she was quite as
safe here as i was when we finally came to my
ledge and i again held her in my arms she re-
called to my mind that for several weeks she had
been living the life of a cave-girl with the tribe of
hatchet-men they had been driven from their
former caves by another tribe which had slain
many and carried off quite half the females and
the new cliffs to which they had flown had proven
far higher and more precipitous so that she had
become through necessity a most practiced
climber

  she told me of khos desire for her since all his
females had been stolen and of how her life had
been a constant nightmare of terror as she sought
by night and by day to elude the great brute for
a time nobs had been all the protection she re-
quired but one day he disappeared-nor has she
seen him since she believes that he was delib-
erately made away with and so do i for we both
are sure that he never would have deserted her
with her means of protection gone lys was now
at the mercy of the hatchet-man nor was it many
the land that time forgot



hours before he had caught her at the base of the
cliff and seized her but as he bore her triumph-
antly aloft toward his cave she had managed to
break loose and escape him

  for three days he has pursued me she said
through this horrible world how i have passed
through in safety i cannot guess or how i have
always managed to outdistance him yet i have
done it until just as you discovered me fate was
kind to us bowen

  i nodded my head in assent and crushed her to
me and then we talked and planned as i cooked
antelope-steaks over my fire and we came to the
conclusion that there was no hope of rescue that
she and i were doomed to live and die upon
caprona well it might be worse i would rather
live here always with lys than to live elsewhere
without her and she dear girl says the same

of me but i am afraid of this life for her it is a
hard fierce dangerous life and i shall pray always
that we shall be rescued from it-for her sake

  that night the clouds broke and the moon shone
down upon our little ledge and there hand in hand
we turned our faces toward heaven and plighted
our troth beneath the eyes of god no human
agency could have married us more sacredly than
we are wed we are man and wife and we are
content if god wills it we shall live out our lives
here if he wills otherwise then this manuscript
which i shall now consign to the inscrutable forces
of the sea shall fall into friendly hands however
we are each without hope and so we say good-bye
in this our last message to the world beyond the
barrier cliffs

chapter i

i am forced to admit that even though i had
traveled a long distance to place bowen
tylers manuscript in the hands of his father
i was still a trifle skeptical as to its sincerity since
i could not but recall that it had not been many
years since bowen had been one of the most no-
torious practical jokers of his alma mater the
truth was that as i sat in the tyler library at santa
monica i commenced to feel a trifle foolish and to
wish that i had merely forwarded the manuscript
by express instead of bearing it personally for i
confess that i do not enjoy being laughed at i
have a well-developed sense of humor-when the
joke is not on me

  mr tyler sr was expected almost hourly the
last steamer in from honolulu had brought in-
formation of the date of the expected sailing of his
yacht toreador which was now twenty-four hours
overdue mr tylers assistant secretary who had
been left at home assured me that there was no
doubt but that the toreador had sailed as prom-
ised since he knew his employer well enough to be
positive that nothing short of an act of god would
prevent his doing what he had planned to do i
was also aware of the fact that the sending ap-
paratus of the toreadors wireless equipment was
sealed and that it would only be used in event of
dire necessity there was therefore nothing to
do but wait and i waited

 we discussed the manuscript and hazarded
guesses concerning it and the strange events it nar-
rated the torpedoing of the liner upon which
bowen j tyler jr had taken passage for france
to join the american ambulance was a well-known
fact and i had further substantiated by wire to the
new york office of the owners that a miss la rue
bad been booked for passage further neither she
nor bowen had been mentioned among the list of
survivors nor had the body of either of them been
recovered

  their rescue by the english tug was entirely prob-
able me capture of the enemy z- by the tugs

crew was not beyond the range of possibility and
their adventures during the perilous cruise which
the treachery and deceit of benson extended until
they found themselves in the waters of the far
south pacific with depleted stores and poisoned
water-casks while bordering upon the fantastic
appeared logical enough as narrated event by
event in the manuscript

  caprona has always been considered a more or
less mythical land though it is vouched for by an
eminent navigator of the eighteenth century but
bowens narrative made it seem very real however
many miles of trackless ocean lay between us and
it yes that narrative had us guessing we
were agreed that it was most improbable but
neither of us could say that anything which it con-
tained was beyond the range of possibility the
weird flora and fauna of caspak were as possible
under the thick warm atmospheric conditions of
the superheated crater as they were in the mesozoic
era under almost exactly similar conditions which
were then probably world-wide the assistant sec-
retary had heard of caproni and his discoveries
but admitted that he never had taken much stock
in the one or the other we were agreed that
the one statement most difficult of explanation was
that which reported the entire absence of human
young among the various tribes with which tyler
had had intercourse this was the one irrecon-
cilable statement of the manuscript a world of
adults it was impossible

planning a rescue from the island

we speculated upon the probable fate of brad-
ley and his party of english sailors tyler
had found the graves of two of them how many
more might have perished and miss la rue-
could a young girl long have survived the horrors of
caspak after having been separated from all of her
own kind the assistant secretary wondered if
nobs still was with her and then we both smiled
at this tacit acceptance of the truth of the whole
uncanny tale


amazing stories

  i suppose im a fool remarked the assistant
secretary but by george i cant help believing
it and i can see that girl now with the big aire-
dale at her side protecting her from the terrors
of a million years ago i can visualize the entire
scene-the apelike grimaldi men huddled in their
filthy caves the huge pterodactyls soaring through
the heavy air upon their batlike wings the mighty
dinosaurs moving their clumsy hulks beneath the
dark shadows of pre-glacial forests-the dragons
which we considered myths until science taught us
that they were the true recollections of the first
man handed down through countless ages by word
of mouth from father to son out of the unrecorded
dawn of humanity

  it is stupendous-if true i replied and to
think that possibly they are still there-tyler and
miss la rue-surrounded by hideous dangers and
that possibly bradley still lives and some of his
party i cant help hoping all the time that bowen
and the girl have found the others the last that
bowen knew of them there were six left all told-
the mate bradley the engineer olson and wilson
whitely brady and sinclair there might be some
hope for them if they could join forces but sep-
arated im afraid they couldnt last long

  if only they hadnt let the german prisoners
capture the e- bowen should have had better
judgment than to have trusted them at all the
chances are von schoenvorts succeeded in getting
safely back to kiel and is strutting around with an
iron cross this very minute with a large supply
of oil from the wells they discovered in caspak
with plenty of water and ample provisions there
is no reason why they couldnt have negotiated the
submerged tunnel beneath the barrier cliffs and
made good their escape

  i dont like em said the assistant secretary
but sometimes you got to hand it to em

  yes i growled and theres nothing id enjoy
more than handing it to them and then the
telephone-bell rang

  the assistant secretary answered and as i
watched him i saw his jaw drop and his face go
white my god he exclaimed as he hung up the
receiver as one in a trance it cant be

  what i asked

  mr tyler is dead he answered in a dull voice
he died at sea suddenly yesterday

  the next ten days were occupied in burying mr
bowen j tyler sr and arranging plans for the
succor of his son mr tom billings the late mr
tylers secretary did it all he is force energy
initiative and good judgment combined and per-
sonified i never have beheld a more dynamic
young man he handled lawyers courts and execu-
tors as a sculptor handles his modeling clay he
formed fashioned and forced them to his will he
had been a classmate of bowen tyler at college and
a fraternity brother and before that he had been
an impoverished and improvident cow-puncher on
one of the great tyler ranches tyler sr had
picked him out of thousands of employees and made
him or rather tyler had given him the opportunity
and then billings had made himself tyler jr
as good a judge of men as his father had taken him
into his friendship and between the two of them
they had turned out a man who would have died

for a tyler as quickly as he would have for his
flag yet there was none of the sycophant or
fawner in billings ordinarily i do not wax en-
thusiastic about men but this man billings comes
as close to my conception of what a regular man
should be as any i have ever met i venture to say
that before bowen j tyler sent him to college he
had never heard the word ethics and yet i am
equally sure that in all his life he never has trans-
gressed a single tenet of the code of ethics of an
american gentleman

finding caprona the seaplane

ten days after they brought mr tylers body
off the toreador we steamed out into the
pacific in search of caprona there were forty in
the party including the master and crew of the
toreador and billings the indomitable was in com-
mand we had a long and uninteresting search for
caprona for the old map upon which the assistant
secretary had finally located it was most inaccurate
when its grim walls finally rose out of the oceans
mists before us we were so far south that it was a
question as to whether we were in the south pacific
or the antarctic bergs were numerous and it was
very cold

  all during the trip billings had steadfastly evad-
ed questions as to how we were to enter caspak after
we had found caprona bowen tylers manuscript
had made it perfectly evident to all that the subter-
ranean outlet of the caspakian river was the only
means of ingress or egress to the crater world be-
yond the impregnable cliffs tylers party had been
able to navigate this channel because their craft had
been a submarine but the toreador could as easily
have flown over the cliffs as sailed under them
jimmy hollis and colin short whiled away many an
hour inventing schemes for surmounting the ob-
stacle presented by the barrier cliffs and making
ridiculous wagers as to which one tom billings had
in mind but immediately we were all assured that
we had raised caprona billings called us together

  there was no use in talking about these things
he said until we found the island at best it can
be but conjecture on our part until we have been
able to scrutinize the coast closely each of us has
formed a mental picture of the capronian seacoast
from bowens manuscript and it is not likely that
any two of these pictures resemble each other or
that any of them resembles the coast as we shall
presently find it i have in view three plans for
scaling the cliffs and the means for carrying out
each is in the hold there is an electric drill with
plenty of water-proof cable to reach from the ships
dynamos to the cliff-top when the toreador is an-
chored at a safe distance from shore and there is
sufficient half-inch iron rod to build a ladder from
the base to the top of the cliff it would be a long
arduous and dangerous work to bore the holes and
insert the rungs of the ladder from the bottom up-
ward  yet it can be done

  i also have a life-saving mortar with which we
might be able to throw a line over the summit of
the cliffs but this plan would necessitate one of us
climbing to the top with the chances more than
even that the line would cut at the summit or the
hooks at the upper end would slip

my third plan seems to me the most feasible
the land that time forgot



you all saw a number of large heavy boxes lowered
into the hold before we sailed i know you did be-
cause you asked me what they contained and com-
mented upon the large letter h which was painted
upon each box these boxes contain the various
parts of a hydro-aeroplane i purpose assembling
this upon the strips of beach described in bowens
manuscript-the beach where he found the dead
body of the apelike man-provided there is suffic-
ient space aove high water otherwise we shall
have to assemble it on deck and lower it over the
side after it is assembled i shall carry tackle and
ropes to the cliff-top and then it will be compara-
tively simple to hoist the search-party and its sup-
plies in safety or i can make a sufficient number
of trips to land the entire party in the valley be-
yond the barrier all will depend of course upon
what my first reconnaissance reveals

  that afternoon we steamed slowly along the face
of capronas towering barrier

  you see now remarked billings as we craned
our necks to scan the summit thousands of feet
above us how futile it would have been to waste
our time in working out details of a plan to sur-
mount those and he jerked his thumb toward the
cliffs it would take weeks possibly months to
construct a ladder to the top i had no conception
of their formidable height our mortar would not
carry a line halfway to the crest of the lowest point
there is no use discussing any plan other than the
hydro-aeroplane well find the beach and get busy
late the following morning the lookout announced
that he could discern surf about a mile ahead and
as we approached we all saw the line of breakers
broken by a long sweep of rolling surf upon a nar-
row beach the launch was lowered and five of us
made a landing getting a good ducking in the ice-
cold waters in the doing of it but we were rewarded
by the finding of the clean-picked bones of what
might have been the skeleton of a high order of ape
or a very low order of man lying close to the base
of the cliff billings was satisfied as were the rest
of us that this was the beach mentioned by bowen
and we further found that there was ample room
to assemble the seaplane

a disappearance

billings having arrived at a decision lost no
time in acting with the result that before mid-
afternoon we had landed all the large boxes marked
h upon the beach and were busily engaged in
opening them two days later the plane was as-
sembled and tuned we loaded tackles and ropes
water food and ammunition in it and then we each
implored billings to let us be the one to accompany
him but he would take no one that was billings
if there was any especially difficult or dangerous
work to be done that one man could do billings
always did it himself if he needed assistance he
never called for volunteers-just selected the man
or men he considered best qualified for the duty
he said that he considered the principles underly-
ing all volunteer service fundamentally wrong and
that it seemed to him that calling for volunteers
reflected upon the courage and loyalty of the entire
command

  we rolled the plane down to the waters edge and
billings mounted the pilots seat there was a mo-

ments delay as he assured himself that he had
everything necessary jimmy hollis went over his
armament and ammunition to see that nothing had
been omitted besides pistol and rifle there was
the machine-gun mounted in front of him on the
plane and ammunition for all three bowens ac-
count of the terrors of caspak had impressed us all
with the necessity for proper means of defense

  at last all was ready the motor was started and
we pushed the plane out into the surf a moment
later and she was skimming seaward gently she
rose from the surface of the water executed a wide
spiral as she mounted rapidly circled once far
above us and then disappeared over the crest of the
cliffs we all stood silent and expectant our eyes
glued upon the towering summit above us hollis
who was now in command consulted his wrist-
watch at frequent intervals

  gad exclaimed short we ought to be hear-
ing from him pretty soon

  hollis laughed nervously hes been gone only
ten minutes he announced

  seems like an hour snapped short whats
that did you hear that hes firing its the ma-
chine-gun oh lord and here we are as helpless
as a lot of old ladies ten thousand miles away we
cant do a thing we dont know whats happening
why didnt he let one of us go with him

  yes it was the machine-gun we could hear it
distinctly for at least a minute then came silence
that was two weeks ago we have had no sign or
signal from tom billings since

chapter ii

ill never forget my first impressions of caspak
as i circled in high over the surrounding
cliffs from the plane i looked down through
a njist upon the blurred landscape beneath me
the hot humid atmosphere of caspak condenses as
it is fanned by the cold antarctic air-currents
which sweep across the craters top sending a ten-
uous ribbon of vapor far out across the pacific
through this the picture gave one the suggestion
of a colossal impressionistic canvrs in greens and
browns and scarlets and yellows surrounding the
deep blue of the inland sea-just blobs of color
taking form through the tumbling mist

  i dived close to the cliffs and skirted them for
several miles without finding the least indication
of a suitable landing-place and then i swung back
at a lower level looking for a clearing close to the
bottom of the mighty escarpment but i could find
none of sufficient area to insure safety i was fly-
ing pretty low by this time not only looking for
landing places but watching the myriad life be-
neath me i was down pretty well toward the south
end of the island where an arm of the lake reaches
far inland and i could see the surface of the water
literally black with creatures of some sort i was
too far up to recognize individuals but the general
impression was of a vast army of amphibious mon-
sters the land was almost equally alive with
crawling leaping running flying things it was
one of the latter which nearly did for me while my
attention was fixed upon the weird scene below

  the first intimation i had of it was the sudden
blotting out of the sunlight from above and as i
glanced quickly up i saw a most terrific creature


amazing stories

swooping down upon me it must have been fully
eighty feet long from the end of its long hideous
beak to the tip of its thick short tail with an equal
spread of wings it was coming straight for me
and hissing frightfully-i could hear it above the
whir of the propeller it was coming straight
down toward the muzzle of the machine-gun and i
let it have it right in the breast but still it came
for me so that i had to dive and turn though i was
dangerously close to earth

  the thing didnt miss me by a dozen feet and
when i rose it wheeled and followed me but only
to the cooler air close to the level of the cliff-tops
there it turned again and dropped something-
mans natural love of battle and the chase i pre-
sume-impelled me to pursue it and so i too circled
and dived the moment i came down into the
warm atmosphere of caspak the creature came for
me again rising above me so that it might swoop
down upon me nothing could better have suited
my armament since my machine-gun was pointed
upward at an angle of about  and could not be
either depressed or elevated by the pilot if i had
brought some one along with me we could have
raked the great reptile from almost any position
but as the creatures mode of attack was always
from above he always found me ready with a hail
cyf bullets the battle must have lasted a minute
or more before the thing suddenly turned completely
over in the air and fell to the ground

    bowen and i roomed together at college and
i learned a lot from him outside my regular course
he was a pretty good scholar despite his love of
fun and his particular hobby was paleontology
he used to tell me about the various forms of ani-
mal and vegetable life which had covered the globe
during former eras and so i was pretty well ac-
quainted with the fishes amphibians reptiles and
mammals of paleolithic times i knew that the
thing that had attacked me was some sort of ptero-
dactyl which should have been extinct millions of
years ago it was all that i needed to realize that
bowen had exaggerated nothing in his manuscript

the pterodactyl disaster

having disposed of my first foe i set myself
once more to search for a landing-place near
to the base of the cliffs beyond which my party
awaited me i knew how anxious they would be
for word from me and i was equally anxious to
relieve their minds and also to get them and our
supplies well within caspak so that we might set
off about our business of finding and rescuing
bowen tyler but the pterodactyls carcass had
scarcely fallen before i was surrounded by at least
a dozen of the hideous things some large some
small but all bent upon my destruction i could
not cope with them all and so i rose rapidly from
among them to the cooler strata wherein they dared
not follow and then i recalled that bowens nar-
rative distinctly indicated that the farther north
one traveled in caspak the fewer were the terrible
reptiles which rendered human life impossible at
the southern end of the island

  there seemed nothing now but to search out a
more northerly landing-place and then return to

the toreador and transport my companions two by
two over the cliffs and deposit them at the ren-
dezvous as i flew north the temptation to ex-
plore overcame me i knew that i could easily cover
caspak and return to the beach with less petrol
than i had in my tanks and there was the hope
too that i might find bowen or some of his party
the broad expanse of the inland sea lured me out
over its waters and as i crossed i saw at either
extremity of the great body of water an island-
one to the south and one to the north but i did
not alter my course to examine either closely leav-
ing that to a later time

  the further shore of the sea revealed a much
narrower strip of land between the cliffs and the
water than upon the western side but it was a
hillier and more open country there were splen-
did landing-places and in the distance toward the
north i thought i descried a village but of that i
was not positive however as i approached the
land i saw a number of human figures apparently
pursuing one who fled across a broad expanse of
meadow as i dropped lower to have a better look
at these people they caught the whirring of my
propellers and looked aloft they paused an in-
stant-pursuers and pursued and then they broke
and raced for the shelter of the nearest wood al-
most instantaneously a huge bulk swooped down
upon me and as i looked up i realized that there
were flying reptiles even in this part of caspak the
creature dived for my right wing so quickly that
nothing but a sheer drop could have saved me i
was already close to the ground so that my man-
euver was extremely dangerous but i was in a
fair way of making it successfully when i saw that
i was too closely approaching a large tree my
effort to dodge the tree and the pterodactyl at the
same time resulted disastrously one wing touched
an upper branch the plane tipped and swung
around and then out of control dashed into the
branches of the tree where it came to rest bat-
tered and torn forty feet above the ground

  hissing loudly the huge reptile swept close
above the tree in which my plane had lodged
circled twice over me and then flapped away toward
the south as i guessed then and was to learn
later forests are the surest sanctuary from these
hideous creatures which with their enormous
spread of wing and their great weight are as much
out of place among trees as is a seaplane

  for a minute or so i clung there to my battered
flyer now useless beyond redemption my brain
numbed by the frightful catastrophe that had be-
fallen me all my plans for the succor of bowen
and miss la rue had depended upon this craft
and in a few brief minutes my own selfish love of
adventure had wrecked their hopes and mine and
what effect it might have upon the future of the
balance of the rescuing expedition i could not even
guess their lives too might be sacrificed to my
suicidal foolishness that i was doomed seemed
inevitable but i can honestly say that the fate of
my friends concerned me more greatly than did
my own

  beyond the barrier cliffs my party was even now
nervously awaiting my return presently appre-
hension and fear would claim them-and they
would never know they would attempt to scale
the land that time forgot



the cliffs-of that i was sure but i was not so
positive that they would succeed and after a while
they would turn back what there were left of them
and go sadly and mournfully upon their return-
journey home home i set my jaws and tried
to forget the word for i knew that i should never
again see home

on foot in caspak

and what of bowen and his girl i had doomed
them too they would never even know that
an attempt had been made to rescue them if they
still lived they might some day come upon the
ruined remnants of this great plane hanging in
its lofty sepulcher and hazard vain guesses and be
filled with wonder but they would never know
and i could not but be glad that they would not
know that tom billings had sealed their death-
warrants by his criminal selfishness

  all these useless regrets were getting me in a
bad way but at last i shook myself and tried to
put such things out of my mind and take hold of
conditions as they existed and do my level best to
wrest victory from defeat i was badly shaken up
and bruised but considered myself mighty lucky
to escape with my life the plane hung at a pre-
carious angle so that it was with difficulty and
considerable danger that i climbed from it into the
tree and then to the ground

  my predicament was grave between me and
my friends lay an inland sea fully sixty miles wide
at this point and an estimated land-distance of
some three hundred miles around the northern end
of the sea through such hideous dangers as i am
perfectly free to admit had me pretty well buf-
faloed i had seen quite enough of caspak this
day to assure me that bowen had in no way exag-
gerated its perils as a matter of fact i am in-
clined to believe that he had become so accustomed
to them before he started upon his manuscript that
he rather slighted them as i stood there beneath
that tree-a tree which should have been part of a
coal-bed countless ages since-and looked out across
a sea teeming with frightful life-life which
should have been fossil before god conceived of
adam-i would not have given a minim of stale
beer for my chances of ever seeing my friends or
the outside world again yet then and there i swore
to fight my way as far through this hideous land
as circumstances would permit i had plenty of
ammunition an automatic pistol and a heavy rifle
-the latter one of twenty added to our equipment
on the strength of bowens description of the huge
beasts of prey which ravaged caspak my greatest
danger lay in the hideous reptilia whose low nervous
organizations permitted their carnivorous instincts
to function for several minutes after they had
ceased to live

  but to these things i gave less thought than to
the sudden frustration of all our plans with the
bitterest of thoughts i condemned myself for the
foolish weakness that had permitted me to be
drawn from the main object of my flight into prema-
ture and useless exploration it seemed to me then
that i must be totally eliminated from further
search for bowen since as i estimated it the three
hundred miles of caspakian territory i must tra-
verse to reach the base of the cliffs beyond which

my party awaited me were practically impassable
for a single individual unaccustomed to caspakian
life and ignorant of all that lay before him yet
i could not give up hope entirely my duty lay
clear before me i must follow it while life re-
mained to me and so i set forth toward the north

  the country through which i took my way was
as lovely as it was unusual-i had almost said un-
earthly for the plants the trees the blooms were
not of the earth that i knew they were larger
the colors more brilliant and the shapes startling
some almost to grotesqueness though even such
added to the charm and romance of the landscape
as the giant cacti render weirdly beautiful the
waste spots of the sad mohave and the sun
shone huge and round and red over all a monster
sun above a monstrous world its light dispersed by
the humid air of caspak-the warm moist air which
lies sluggish upon the breast of this great mother
of life natures mightiest incubator

  all about me in every direction was life it
moved through the tree-tops and among the boles
it displayed itself in widening and intermingling
circles upon the bosom of the sea it leaped above
the surface it rose majestic and terrible from the
depths i could hear it in a dense wood at my right
the murmur of it rising and falling in ceaseless
volumes of sound riven at intervals by a horrid
scream or a thunderous roar which shook the earth
and always i was haunted by that inexplicable sen-
sation that unseen eyes were watching me that
soundless feet dogged my trail i am neither
nervous nor high-strung but the burden of re-
sponsibility upon me weighed heavily so that i
was more cautious than is my wont i turned often
to right and left and rear lest i be surprised and
i carried my rifle at the ready in my hand once i
could have sworn that among the many creatures
dimly perceived amidst the shadows of the wood i
saw a human figure dart from one cover to another
but i could not be sure

a fair native and the panther

for the most part i skirted the wood making
occasional detours rather than enter those for-
bidding depths of gloom though many times i was
forced to pass through arms of the forest which
extended to the very shore of the inland sea there
was so sinister a suggestion in the uncouth sounds
and the vague glimpses of moving things within
the forest of the menace of strange beasts and
possibly still stranger men that i always breathed
more freely when i had passed once more into open
country

  i had traveled northward for perhaps an hour
still haunted by the conviction that i was being
stalked by some creature which kept always just
hidden among the trees and shrubbery to my right
and a little to my rear when for the hundredth
time i was attracted by a sound from that direc-
tion and turning saw some animal running rap-
idly through the forest toward me there was no
longer any effort on its part at concealment it
came on through the underbrush swiftly and i was
confident that whatever it was it had finally gath-
ered the courage to charge me boldly befoi-e it
finally broke into plain view i became aware that
it was not alone for a few yards in its rear a sec-


amazing stories

ond thing thrashed through the leafy jungle evi-
dently i was to be attacked in force by a pair of
hunting beasts or men

  and then through the last clump of waving ferns
broke the figure of the foremost creature which
came leaping toward me on light feet as i stood
with my rifle to my shoulder covering the point at
which i had expected it would emerge i must
have looked foolish indeed if my surprise and con-
sternation were in any way reflected upon my
countenance as i lowered my rifle and gazed in-
credulous at the lithe figure of the girl speeding
swiftly in my direction but i did not have long
to stand thus with lowered weapon for as she came
i saw her cast an affrighted glance over her
shoulder and at the same moment there broke
from the jungle at the same spot at which i had
seen her the hugest cat i had ever looked upon

  at first i took the beast for a saber-tooth tiger
as it was quite the most fearsome-appearing beast
one could imagine but it was not that dread mon-
ster of the past though quite formidable enough to
satisfy the most fastidious thrill-hunter on it
came grim and terrible its baleful eyes glaring
above its distended jaws its lips curled in a fright-
ful snarl which exposed a whole mouthful of for-
midable teeth at sight of me it had abandoned its
impetuous rush and was now sneaking slowly
toward us while the girl a long knife in her hand
took her stand bravely at my left and a little to
my rear she had called something to me in a
strange tongue as she raced toward me and now
she spoke again but what she said i could not then
of course know-only that her tones were sweet
well modulated and free from any suggestion of
panic

  facing the huge cat which i now saw was
an enormous panther i waited until i could place
a shot where i felt it would do the most good for
at best a frontal shot at any of the large carnivora
is a ticklish matter i had some advantage in that
the beast was not charging its head was held low
and its back exposed and so at forty yards i took
careful aim at its spine at the junction of neck and
shoulders but at the same instant as though sens-
ing my intention the great creature lifted its head
and leaped forward in full charge to fire at that
sloping forehead i knew would be worse than use-
less and so i quickly shifted my aim and pulled
the trigger hoping against hope that the soft-nosed
bullet and the heavy charge of powder would have
sufficient stopping effect to give me time to place a
second shot

  in answer to the report of the rifle i had the
satisfaction of seeing the brute spring into the air
turning a complete somersault but it was up
again almost instantly though in the brief second
that it took it to scramble to its feet and get its
bearings it exposed its left side fully toward me
and a second bullet went crashing through its
heart down it went for the second time-and
then up and at me the vitality of these creatures
of caspak is one of the marvelous features of this
strange world and bespeaks the low nervous organ-
ization of the old paleolithic life which has been
so long extinct in other portions of the world

  i put a third bullet into the beast at three paces
and then i thought that i was done for but it

rolled over and stopped at my feet stone dead i
found that my second bullet had torn its heart
almost completely away and yet it had lived to
charge ferociously upon me and but for my third
shot would doubtless have slain me before it finally
expired-or as bowen tyler so quaintly puts it
before it knew that it was dead

the alus

with the panther quite evidently conscious of
the fact that dissolution had overtaken it i
turned toward the girl who was regarding me with
evident admiration and not a little awe though i
must admit that my rifle claimed quite as much of
her attention as did i she was quite the most won-
derful animal that i have ever looked upon and
what few of her charms her apparel hid it quite
effectively succeeded in accentuating a bit of
soft undressed leather was caught over her left
shoulder and beneath her right breast falling upon
her left side to her hip and upon the right to a
metal band which encircled her leg above the knee
and to which the lowest point of the hide was at-
tached about her waist was a loose leather belt
to the center of which was attached the scabbard
belonging to her knife there was a single armlet
between her right shoulder and elbow and a series
of them covered her left forearm from elbow to
wrist these i learned later answer the purpose
of a shield against knife attack when the left arm
is raised in guard across the breast or face

  her masses of heavy hair were held in place by
a broad metal band which bore a large triangular
ornament directly in the center of her forehead
this ornament appeared to be a huge turquoise
while the metal of all her ornaments was beaten
virgin gold inlaid in intricate design with bits of
mother-of-pearl and tiny pieces of stone of various
colors from the left shoulder depended a leop-
ards tail while her feet were shod with sturdy
little sandals the knife was her only weapon its
blade was of iron the grip was wound with hide
and protected by a guard of three out-bowing strips
of flat iron and upon the top of the hilt was a knob
of gold

  i took in much of this in the few seconds during
which we stood facing each other and i also ob-
served another salient feature of her appearance
she was frightfully dirty her face and limbs and
garment were streaked with mud and perspira-
tion and yet even so i felt that i had never looked
upon so perfect and beautiful a creature as she
her figure beggars description and equally so her
face were i one of these writer-fellows i should
probably say that her features were grecian but
being neither a writer nor a poet i can do her
greater justice by saying that she combined all of
the finest lines that one sees in the typical amer-
ican girls face rather than the pronounced sheep-
like physiognomy of the greek goddess no even
the dirt couldnt hide that fact she was beautiful
beyond compare

  as we stood looking at each other a slow smile
came to her face parting her symmetrical lips and
disclosing a row of strong white teeth

  gcdu she asked with rising inflection

  and remembering that i read in bowens manu-
script that galu seemed to indicate a higher type
the land that time forgot



of man i answered by pointing to myself and re-
peating the word then she started off on a regular
catechism if i could judge by her inflection for i
certainly understood no word of what she said all
the time the girl kept glancing toward the forest
and at last she touched my arm and pointed in that
direction

  turning i saw a hairy figure of a manlike thing
standing watching us and presently another and
another emerged from the jungle and joined the
leader until there must have been at least twenty
of them they were entirely naked their bodies
were covered with hair and though they stood upon
their feet without touching their hands to the
ground they had a very apelike appearance since
they stooped forward and had very long arms and
quite apish features they were not pretty to look
upon with their close-set eyes flat noses long upper
lips and protruding yellow fangs

  alus said the girl

  i had reread bowens adventures so often that i
knew them almost by heart and so i now knew that
i was looking upon the last remnant of that an-
cient man-race-the alus of a forgotten period-
the speechless man of antiquity

  razor cried the girl and at the same moment
the alus came jabbering toward us they made
strange growling barking noises as with much
baring of fangs they advanced upon us they were
armed only with natures weapons-powerful mus-
cles and giant fangs yet  knew that these were
quite sufficient to overcome us had we nothing bet-
ter to offer in defense and so i drew my pistol and
fired at the leader he dropped like a stone and
the others turned and fled once again the girl
smiled her slow smile and stepping closer caressed
the barrel of my automatic as she did so her
fingers came in contact with mine and a sudden
thrill ran through me which i attributed to the
fact that it had been so long since i had seen a
woman of any sort or kind

not a ladys man a dirty goddess

she said something to me in her low liquid
tones but i could not understand her and then
she pointed toward the north and started away i
followed her for my way was north too but had it
been south i still should have followed so hungry
was i for human companionship in this world of
beasts and reptiles and half-men

  we walked along the girl talking a great deal
and seeming mystified that i could not understand
her her silvery laugh rang merrily when i in
turn essayed to speak to her as though my lan-
guage was the quaintest thing she ever had heard
often after fruitless attempts to make me under-
stand she would hold her palm toward me saying
galu and then touch my breast or arm and cry
alu alu i knew what she meant for i had learned
from bowens narrative the negative gesture and
the two words which she repeated she meant that
i was no galu as i claimed but an alu or speech-
less one yet every time she said this she laughed
again and so infectious were her tones that i could
only join her it was only natural too that she
should be mystified by my inability to comprehend
her or to make her comprehend me for from the
club-men the lowest human type in caspak to have

speech to the golden race of galus the tongues
of the various tribes are identical except for am-
plifications in the rising scale of evolution she
who is a galu can understand one of the bo-lu and
make herself understood to him or to a hatchet-
man a spear-man or an archer the ho-lus or
apes the alus and myself were the only creatures
of human semblance with which she could hold no
converse yet it was evident that her intelligence
told her that i was neither ho-lu nor alu neither
anthropoid ape nor speechless man

   yet she did not despair but set out to teach me
her language and had it not been that i worried
so greatly over the fate of bowen and my com-
panions of the toreador i could have wished the
period of instruction prolonged

   i never have been what one might call a ladies
man though i like their company immensely and
during my college days and since have made vari-
ous friends among the sex i think that i rather
appeal to a certain type of girl for the reason that
i never make love to them i leave that to the
numerous others who do it infinitely better than i
could hope to and take my pleasure out of girls
sobiety in what seem to be more rational ways-
dancing golfing boating riding tennis and the
like yet in the company of this half-naked little
savage i found a new pleasure that was entirely
distinct from any that i ever had experienced
when she touched me i thrilled as i had never be-
fore thrilled in contact with another woman i
could not quite understand it for i am sufficiently
sophisticated to know that this is a symptom of
love and i certainly did not love this filthy little
barbarian with her broken unkempt nails and her
skin so besmeared with mud and the green of
crushed foliage that it was difficult to say what
color it originally had been but if she was out-
wardly uncouth her clear eyes and strong white
even teeth her silvery laugh and her queenly car-
riage bespoke an innate fineness which dirt could
not quite successfully conceal

  the sun was low in the heavens when we came
upon a little river which emptied into a large bay
at the foot of low cliffs our journey so far had
been beset with constant danger as is every jour-
ney in this frightful land i have not bored you
with a recital of the wearying successions of at-
tacks by the multitude of creatures which were con-
stantly crossing our path or deliberately stalking
us we were always upon the alert for here to
paraphrase eternal vigilance is indeed the price of
life

   i had managed to progress a little in the acqui-
sition of a knowledge of her tongue so that i knew
many of the animals and reptiles by their caspakian
names and trees and ferns and grasses i knew
the words for sea and river and cliff for sky and
sun and cloud yes i was getting along finely and
then it occurred to me that i didnt know my com-
panions name so i pointed to myself and said
tom then i pointed to her and raised my eye-
brows in interrogation the girl ran her fingers
into that mass of hair and looked puzzled i re-
peated the action a dozen times

  tom she said finally in that clear sweet
liquid voice tom

  i had never thought much of my name before


amazing stories

but when she spoke it it sounded to me for the first
time in my life like a mighty nice name and then
she brightened suddenly and tapped her own breast
and said ajor

  ajor i repeated and she laughed and struck
her palms together

  well we knew each others names now and that
was some satisfaction i rather liked hers--ajor
and she seemed to like mine for she repeated it

a bath in caspak

so we came to the cliffs beside the little river
where it empties into the bay with the great in-
land sea beyond the qliffs were weather-worn and
rotted and in one place a deep hollow ran back be-
neath the overhanging stone for several feet sug-
gesting shelter for the night there were loose
rocks strewn all about with which i might build a
barricade across the entrance to the cave and so i
halted there and pointed out the place to ajor try-
ing to make her understand that we would spend
the night here

  as soon as she grasped my meaning she assented
with the caspakian equivalent of an affirmative nod
and then touching my rifle motioned to me to fol-
low her to the river at the bank she paused re-
moved her belt and dagger dropping them to the
ground at her side then unfastening the lower
edge of her garment from the metal leg-band to
which it was attached slipped it off her left shoul-
der and let it drop to the ground around her feet
it was done so naturally so simply and so quickly
that it left me gasping like a fish out of water
turning she flashed a smile at me and then dived
into the river and there she bathed while i stood
guard over her for five or ten minutes she
splashed about and when she emerged her glisten-
ing skin was smooth and white and beautiful
without means of drying herself she simply
ignored what to me would have seemed a necessity
and in a moment was arrayed in her simple though
effective costume

  it was now within an hour of darkness and as i
was nearly famished i led the way back about a
quarter of a mile to a low meadow where we had
seen antelope and small horses a short time before
here i brought down a young buck the report of
my rifle sending the balance of the herd scamper-
ing for the woods where they were met by a
chorus of hideous roars as the carnivora took ad-
vantage of their panic and leaped among them

  with my hunting-knife i removed a hind-quarter
and then we returned to camp here i gathered a
great quantity of wood from fallen trees ajor
helping me but before i built a fire i also gath-
ered sufficient loose rock to build my barricade
against the frightful terrors of the night to come

  i shall never forget the expression upon ajors
face as she saw me strike a match and light the
kindling beneath our camp-fire it was such an
expression as might transform a mortal face with
awe as its owner beheld the mysterious workings
of divinity it was evident that ajor was quite
unfamiliar with modern methods of fire-making
she had thought my rifle and pistol wonderful but
these tiny slivers of wood which from a magic rub

brought flame to the camp hearth were indeed
miracles to her

  as the meat roasted above the fire ajor and i
tried once again to talk but though copiously filled
with incentive gestures and sounds the conversa-
tion did not flourish notably and then ajor took
up in earnest the task of teaching me her language
she commenced as i later learned with the simplest
form of speech known to caspak or for that matter
to the world-that employed by the bo-lu i found
it far from difficult and even though it was a great
handicap upon my instructor that she could not
speak my language she did remarkably well and
demonstrated that she possessed ingenuity and in-
telligence of a high order

  after we had eaten i added to the pile of fire-
wood so that i could replenish the fire before the
entrance to our barricade believing this as good a
protection against the carnivora as we could have
and then ajor and i sat down before it and the
lesson proceeded while from all about us came the
weird and awesome noises of the caspakian night
-the moaning and the coughing and roaring of the
tigers the panthers and the lions the barking and
the dismal howling of wolf jackal and hyaenadon
the shrill shrieks of stricken prey and the hissing
of the great reptiles the voice of man alone was
silent

  but though the voice of this choir-terrible rose
and fell from far and near in all directions reach-
ing at times such a tremendous volume of sound
that the earth shook to it yet so engrossed was i
in my lesson and in my teacher that often i was
deaf to what at another time would have filled me
with awe the face and voice of the beautiful girl
who leaned so eagerly toward me as she tried to
explain the meaning of some word or correct my
pronunciation of another quite entirely occupied my
every faculty of perception the firelight shone
upon her animated features and sparkling eyes it
accentuated the graceful motions of her gesturing
arms and hands it sparkled from her white teeth
and from her golden ornaments and glistened on
the smooth firmness of her perfect skin i am
afraid that often i was more occupied with admira-
tion of this beautiful animal than with a desire for
knowledge but be that as it may i nevertheless
learned much that evening though part of what i
learned had naught to do with any new language

  ajor seemed determined that i should speak
caspakian as quickly as possible and i thought i
saw in her desire a little of that all-feminine trait
which has come down through all the ages from the
first lady of the world-curiosity ajor desired
that i should speak her tongue in order that she
might satisfy a curiosity concerning me that was
filling her to a point where she was in danger of
bursting of that i was positive she was a regu-
lar little animated question-mark she bubbled
over with interrogations which were never to be
satisfied unless i learned to speak her tongue her
eyes sparkled with excitement her hand flew in
expressive gestures her little tongue raced with
time yet all to no avail i could say man and tree
and cliff and lion and a number of other words in
perfect caspakian but such a vocabulary was only
tantalizing it did not lend itself well to a very gen-
eral conversation and the result was that ajor
the land that time forgot



would wax so wroth that she would clench her little
fists and beat me on the breast as hard as ever she
could and then she would sink back laughing as
the humor of the situation captured her

  she was trying to teach me some verbs by going
through the actions herself as she repeated the
proper word we were very much engrossed-so
much so that we were giving no heed to what went
on beyond our cave-when ajor stopped very sud-
denly crying razor now she had been try-
ing to teach me that ju meant stop so when she
cried kazor and at the same time stopped i thought
for a moment that this was part of my lesson-
for the moment i forgot that kazor means beware
i therefore repeated the word after her but when
i saw the expression in her eyes as they were
directed past me and saw her point toward the en-
trance to the cave i turned quickly-to see a
hideous face at the small aperture leading out into
the night it was the fierce and snarling counte-
nance of a gigantic bear i have hunted silver-tips
in the white mountains of arizona and thought
them quite the largest and most formidable of big
game but from the appearance of the head of this
awful creature i judged that the largest grizzly i
had ever seen would shrink by comparison to the
dimensions of a newfoundland dog

the bear of caspak

our fire was just within the cave the smoke
rising through the apertures between the
rocks that i had piled in such a way that they
arched inward toward the cliff at the top the
opening by means of which we were to reach the
outside was barricaded with a few large fragments
which did not by any means close it entirely but
through the apertures thus left no large animal
could gain ingress i had depended most however
upon our fire feeling that none of the dangerous
nocturnal beasts of prey would venture close to the
flames in this however i was quite evidently in
error for the great bear stood with his nose not
a foot from the blaze which was now low owing
to the fact that i had been so occupied with my
lesson and my teacher that i had neglected to re-
plenish it

  ajor whipped out her futile little knife and
pointed to my rifle at the same time she spoke in
a quite level voice entirely devoid of nervousness or
any evidence of fear or panic i knew she was ex-
horting me to fire upon the beast but this i did
not wish to do other than as a last resort for i
was quite sure that even my heavy bullets would
not more than further enrage him-in which case
he might easily force an entrance to our cave

  instead of firing i piled some more wood upon
the fire and as the smoke and blaze arose in the
beasts face it backed away growling most fright-
fully but i still could see two ugly points of light
blazing in the outer darkness and hear its growls
rumbling terrifically without for some time the
creature stood there watching the entrance to our
frail sanctuary while i racked my brains in futile
endeavor to plan some method of defense or escape
i knew full well that should the bear make a de-
termined effort to get at us the rocks i had piled
as a barrier would come tumbling down about his

giant shoulders like a house of cards and that he
would walk directly in upon us

  ajor having less knowledge of the effectiveness
of firearms than i and therefore greater confidence
in them entreated me to shoot the beast but i
knew that the chance that i could stop it with a
single shot was most remote while that i should
but infuriate it was real and present and so i
waited for what seemed an eternity watching those
devilish points of fire glaring balefully at us and
listening to the ever-increasing volume of those
seismic growls which seemed to rumble upward
from the bowels of the earth shaking the very
cliffs beneath which we cowered until at last i saw
that the brute was again approaching the aperture
it availed me nothing that i piled the blaze high
with firewood until ajor and i were near to roast-
ing on came that mighty engine of destruction
until once again the hideous face yawned its fanged
yawn directly within the barriers opening it
stood thus a moment and then the head was with-
drawn i breathed a sigh of relief the thing had
altered its intention and was going on in search of
other and more easily procurable prey the fire had
been too much for it

  but my joy was short-lived and my heart sank
once again as a moment later i saw a mighty paw
insinuated into the opening-a paw as large around
as a large dish-pan very gently the paw toyed
with the great rock that partly closed the entrance
pushed and pulled upon it and then very deliber-
ately drew it outward and to one side again came
the head and this time much farther into the cav-
ern but still the great shoulders would not pass
through the opening ajor moved closer to me
until her shoulder touched my side and i thought
i felt a slight tremor run through her body but
otherwise she gave no indication of fear involun-
tarily i threw my left arm about her and drew her
to me for an instant it was an act of reassurance
rather than a caress though i must admit that
again and even in the face of death i thrilled at the
contact with her and then i released her and threw
my rifle to my shoulder for at last i had reached
the conclusion that nothing more could be gained
by waiting my only hope was to get as many shots
into the creature as i could before it was upon me
already it had torn away a second rock and was
in the very act of forcing its huge bulk through the
opening it had now made

  so now i took careful aim between its eyes my
right fingers closed firmly and evenly upon the small
of the stock drawing back my trigger-finger by the
muscular action of the hand the bullet could not
fail to hit its mark i held my breath lest i swerve
the muzzle a hair by my breathing i was as steady
and cool as i ever had been upon a target-range
and i had the full consciousness of a perfect hit in
anticipation i knew that i could not miss and
then as the bear surged forward toward me the
hammer fell-futilely upon an imperfect cartridge

  almost simultaneously i heard from without a
perfectly hellish roar the bear gave voice to a
series of growls far transcending in volume and
ferocity anything that he had yet essayed and at
the same time backed quickly from the cave for
an instant i couldnt understand what had happened
to cause this sudden retreat when his prey was


amazing stories

practically within his clutches the idea that the
harmless clicking of the hammer had frightened
him was too ridiculous to entertain however we
had not long to wait before we could at least guess
at the cause of the diversion for from without
came mingled growls and roars and the sound of
great bodies thrashing about until the earth shook
the bear had been attacked in the rear by some
other mighty beast and the two were now locked in
a titanic struggle for supremacy with brief res-
pites during which we could hear the labored
breathing of the contestants the battle continued
for the better part of an hour until the sounds of
combat grew gradually less and finally ceased
entirely

  at ajors suggestion made by signs and a few
of the words we knew in common i moved the fire
directly to the entrance to the cave so that a beast
would have to pass directly through the flames to
reach us and then we sat and waited for the victor
of the battle to come and claim his reward but
though we sat for a long time with our eyes glued
to the opening we saw no sign of any beast

  at last i signed to ajor to lie down for i knew
that she must have sleep and i sat on guard until
nearly morning when the girl awoke and insisted
that i take some rest nor would she be denied
but dragged me down as she laughingly menaced
me with her knife

chapter iii

when i awoke it was daylight and i found
ajor squatting before a fine bed of coals
roasting a large piece of antelope-meat
believe me the sight of the new day and the deli-
cious odor of the cooking meat filled me with re-
newed happiness and hope that had been all but
expunged by the experience of the previous night
and perhaps the slender figure of the bright-faced
girl proved also a potent restorative she looked up
and smiled at me showing those perfect teeth and
dimpling with evident happiness-the most adorable
picture that i had ever seen i recall that it was
then i first regretted that she was only a little un-
tutored savage and so far beneath me in the scale
of evolution

  her first act was to beckon me to follow her out-
side and there she pointed to the explanation of
our rescue from the bear-a huge saber-tooth tiger
its fine coat and its flesh torn to ribbons lying dead
a few paces from our cave and beside it equally
mangled and disemboweled was the carcass of a
huge cave-bear to have had ones life saved by
a saber-tooth tiger and in the twentieth century
into the bargain was an experience that was to say
the least unique but it had happened-i had the
proof of it before my eyes

  so enormous are the great carnivora of caspak
that they must feed perpetually to support their
giant thews and the result is that they will eat the
meat of any other creature and will attack anything
that comes within their ken no matter how formid-
able the quarry from later observation-i men-
tion this as worthy the attention of paleontologists
and naturalists-i came to the conclusion that
such creatures as the cave-bear the cave-lion and
the saber-tooth tiger as well as the larger carnivor-
ous reptiles make ordinarily two kills a day-one

in the morning and one after nightfall they im-
mediately devour the entire carcass after which
they lie up and sleep for a few hours fortunately
their numbers are comparatively few otherwise
there would be no other life within caspak
it is their very voracity that keeps their numbers
down to a point which permits other forms of life
to persist for even in the season of love the great
males often turn upon their own mates and devour
them while both males and females occasionally
devour their young how the human and semi-
human races have managed to survive during all
the countless ages that these conditions must have
existed here is quite beyond me

  after breakfast ajor and i set out once more
upon our northward journey we had gone but a
little distance when we were attacked by a number
of apelike creatures armed with clubs they
seemed a little higher in the scale than the alus
ajor told me they were bo-lu or club-men a re-
volver-shot killed one and scattered the others but
several times later during the day we were men-
aced by them until we had left their country and
entered that of the sto-lu or hatchet-men these
people were less hairy and more manlike nor did
they appear so anxious to destroy us rather they
were curious and followed us for some distance
examining us most closely they called out to us
and ajor answered them but her replies did not
seem to satisfy them for they gradually became
threatening and i think they were preparing to
attack us when a small deer that had been hiding
in some low brush suddenly broke cover and dashed
across our front we needed meat for it was near
one oclock and i was getting hungry so i drew
my pistol and with a single shot dropped the crea-
ture in its tracks the effect upon the sto-lu was
electrical immediately they abandoned all
thoughts of war and turning scampered for the
forest which fringed our path

  that night we spent beside a little stream in the
sto-lu country we found a tiny cave in the rock
bank so hidden away that only chance could direct
a beast of prey to it and after we had eaten of
the deer-meat and some fruit which ajor gathered
we crawled into the little hole and with sticks and
stones which i had gathered for the purpose i
erected a strong barricade inside the entrance
nothing could reach us without swimming and
wading through the stream and i felt quite secure
from attack our quarters were rather cramped
the ceiling was so low that we could not stand
up and the floor so narrow that it was with diffi-
culty that we both wedged into it together but we
were very tired and so we made the most of it
and so great was the feeling of security that i am
sure i fell asleep as soon as i had stretched myself
beside ajor

a diplodocus

during the three days which followed our
progress was exasperatingly slow i doubt if
we made ten miles in the entire three days the
country was hideously savage so that we were
forced to spend hours at a time in hiding from one
or another of the great beasts which menaced us
continually there were fewer reptiles but the
quantity of carnivora seemed to have increased
the land that time forgot



and the reptiles that we did see were perfectly
gigantic i shall never forget one enormous speci-
men which we came upon browsing upon water-
reeds at the edge of the great sea it stood well
over twelve feet high at the rump its highest point
and with its enormously long tail and neck it was
somewhere between seventy-five and a hundred feet
in length its head was ridiculously small its body
was unarmored but its great bulk gave it a most
formidable appearance my experience of cas-
pakian life led me to believe that the gigantic crea-
ture would but have to see us to attack us and so
i raised my rifle and at the same time drew away
toward some brush which offered concealment
but ajor only laughed and picking up a stick ran
toward the great thing shouting the little head
was raised high upon the long neck as the animal
stupidly looked here and there in search of the
author of the disturbance at last its eyes dis-
covered tiny little ajor and then she hurled the
stick at the diminutive head with a cry that
sounded not unlike the bleat of a sheep the colossal
creature shuffled into the water and was soon sub-
merged

  as i slowly recalled my collegiate studies and
paleontological readings in bowens text-books i
realized that i had looked upon nothing less than a
diplodocus of the upper jurassic but how in-
finitely different was the true live thing from the
crude restorations of hatcher and holland i had
had the idea that the diplodocus was a land-animal
but evidently it is partially amphibious i have
seen several since my first encounter and in each
case the creature took to the water for conceal-
ment as soon as it was disturbed with the ex-
ception of its gigantic tail it has no weapon of
defense but with this appendage it can lash so
terrific a blow as to lay low even a giant cave-bear
stunned and broken it is a stupid simple gentle
beast-one of the few within caspak which such a
description might even remotely fit

  for three nights we slept in trees finding no
caves or other place of concealment here we
were free from the attacks of the large land carni-
vora but the smaller flying reptiles the snakes
leopards and panthers were a constant menace
though by no means as much to be feared as the
huge beasts that roamed the surface of the earth

  at the close of the third day ajor and i were
able to converse with considerable fluency and it
was a great relief to both of us especially to ajor
she now did nothing but ask questions whenever i
would let her which could not be all the time as
our preservation depended largely upon the rapid-
ity with which i could gain knowledge of the
geography and customs of caspak and accordingly
i had to ask numerous questions myself

  i enjoyed immensely hearing and answering her
so naive were many of her queries and so filled with
wonder was she at the things i told her of the
world beyond the lofty barriers of caspak not once
did she seem to doubt me however marvelous my
statements must have seemed and doubtless they
were the cause of marvel to ajor who before had
never dreamed that any life existed beyond caspak
and the life she knew

  artless though many of her questions were they
evidenced a keen intellect and a shrewdness which

seemed far beyond her years or her experience
altogether i was finding my little savage a mighty
interesting and companionable person and i often
thanked the kind fate that directed the crossing of
our paths from her i learned much of caspak
but there still remained the mystery that had
proved so baffling to bowen tyler-the total ab-
sence of young among the ape the semihuman and
the human races with which both he and i had
come in contact upon opposite shores of the inland
sea ajor tried to explain the matter to me though
it was apparent that she could not conceive how
so natural a condition should demand explanation
she told me that among the galus there were a
few babies that she had once been a baby but that
most of her people came up as she put it cor
sva jo or literally from the beginning and as
they all did when they used that phrase she would
wave a broad gesture toward the south

the country of the band-lu of caspak
uttor long she explained leaning very close to

  -t me and whispering the words into my ear
the while she cast apprehensive glances about and
mostly skyward for long my mother kept me
hidden lest the wieroo passing through the air by
night should come and take me away to oo-oh
and the child shuddered as she voiced the word i
tried to get her to tell me more but her terror was
so real when she spoke of the wieroo and the land
of oo-oh where they dwell that i at last desisted
though i did learn that the wieroo carried off only
female babes and occasionally women of the galus
who had come up from the beginning it was all
very mysterious and unfathomable but i got the
idea that the wieroo were creatures of imagination
-the demons or gods of her race omniscient and
omnipresent this led me to assume that the galus
had a religious sense and further questioning
brought out the fact that such was the case ajor
spoke in tones of reverence of luata the god of
heat and life the word is derived from two
others lua meaning sun and ata meaning vari-
ously eggs life young and reproduction she told
me that they worshiped luata in several forms as
fire the sun eggs and other material objects which
suggested heat and reproduction

  i had noticed that whenever i built a fire ajor
outlined in the air before her with a forefinger an
isosceles triangle and that she did the same in the
morning when she first viewed the sun at first i
had not connected her act with anything in particu-
lar but after we learned to converse and she had
explained a little of her religious superstitions i
realized that she was making the sign of the tri-
angle as a roman catholic makes the sign of the
cross always the short side of the triangle was
uppermost as she explained all this to me she
pointed to the decorations on her golden armlets
upon the knob of her dagger-hilt and upon the band
which encircled her right leg above the knee-
always was the design partly made up of isosceles
triangles and when she explained the significance
of this particular geometric figure i at once grasped
its appropriateness

  we were now in the country of the band-lu the
spearmen of caspak bowen had remarked in his
narrative that these people were analogous to the


amazing stories

so-called cro-magnon race of the upper paleolithic
and i was therefore very anxious to see them nor
was i to be disappointed i saw them all right
we had left the sto-lu country and literally fought
our way through cordons of wild beasts for two
days when we decided to make camp a little earlier
than usual owing to the fact that we had reached
a line of cliffs running east and west in which were
numerous likely cave-lodgings we were both very
tired and the sight of these caverns several of
which could be easily barricaded decided us to halt
until the following morning it took but a few
minutes exploration to discover one particular
cavern high up the face of the cliff which seemed
ideal for our purpose it opened upon a narrow
ledge where we could build our cook-fire the open-
ing was so small that we had to lie flat and wriggle
through it to gain ingress while the interior was
high-ceiled and spacious i lighted a faggot and
looked about but as far as i could see the chamber
ran back into the cliff

  laying aside my rifle pistol and heavy ammuni-
tion-belt i left ajor in the cave while i went down
to gather firewood we already had meat and
fruits which we had gathered just before reaching
the cliffs and my canteen was filled with fresh
water therefore all we required was fuel and as
i always saved ajors strength when i could i
would not permit her to accompany me the poor
girl was very tired but she would have gone with
me until she dropped i know so loyal was she
she was the best comrade in the world and some-
times i regretted and sometimes i was glad that
she was not of my own caste for had she been i
should unquestionably have fallen in love with her
as it was we traveled together like two boys with
huge respect for each other but no softer
sentiment

  there was little timber close to the base of the
cliffs and so i was forced to enter the wood some
two hundred yards distant i realize now how fool-
hardy was my act in such a land as caspak teem-
ing with danger and with death but there is a
certain amount of fool in every man and whatever
proportion of it i own must have been in the
ascendant that day for the truth of the matter is
that i went down into those woods absolutely de-
fenseless  and i paid the price as people usually do
for their indiscretions as i searched around in
the brush for likely pieces of firewood my head
bowed and my eyes upon the ground i suddenly
felt a great weight hurl itself upon me i struggled
to my knees and seized my assailant a huge naked
man-naked except for a breechcloth of snake-skin
the head hanging down to the knees the fellow
was armed with a stone-shod spear a stone knife
and a hatchet in his black hair were several gay-
colored feathers as we struggled to and fro i
was slowly gaining advantage of him when a score
of his fellows came running up and overpowered me

  they bound my hands behind me with long raw-
hide thongs and then surveyed me critically i
found them fine-looking specimens of manhood for
the most part there were some among them who
bore a resemblance to the sto-lu and were hairy
but the majority had massive heads and not unlovely
features there was little about them to suggest
the ape as in the sto-lu bo-lu and alus i ex-

pected them to kill me at once but they did not
instead they questioned me but it was evident that
they did not believe my story for they scoffed and
laughed

  the galus have turned you out they cried
if you go back to them you will die if you re-
main here you will die we shall kill you but
first we shall have a dance and you shall dance with
us-the dance of death

  it sounded quite reassuring but i knew that i
was not to be killed immediately and so i took
heart they led me toward the cliffs and as we
approached them i glanced up and was sure that
i saw ajors bright eyes peering down upon us
from our lofty cave but she gave no sign if she
saw me and we passed on rounded the end of the
cliffs and proceeded along the opposite face of them
until we came to a section literally honeycombed
with caves all about upon the ground and
swarming the ledges before the entrances were
hundreds of members of the tribe there were
many women but no babes or children though i
noticed that the females had better developed
breasts than any that i had seen among the hatchet-
men the club-men the alus or the apes in fact
among the lower orders of caspakian man the
female breast is but a rudimentary organ barely
suggested in the apes and alus and only a little
more defined in the bo-lu and sto-lu though al-
ways increasingly so until it is found about half
developed in the females of the spear-men yet
never was there an indication that the females had
suckled young nor were there any young among
them some of the band-lu women were quite
comely the figures of all both men and women
were symmetrical though heavy and though there
were some who verged strongly upon the sto-lu
type there were others who were positively hand-
some and whose bodies were quite hairless the
alus are all bearded but among the bo-lu the
beard disappears in the women the sto-lu men
show a sparse beard the band-lu none and there is
little hair upon the bodies of their women

  the members of the tribe showed great interest
in me especially in my clothing the like of which
of course they never had seen they pulled and
hauled upon me and some of them struck me but
for the most part they were not inclined to brutal-
ity it was only the hairier ones who most closely
resembled the sto-lu who maltreated me at last
my captors led me into a great cave in the mouth
of which a fire was burning the floor was littered
with filth including the bones of many animals
and the atmosphere reeked with the stench of
human bodies and putrifying flesh here they fed
me releasing my arms and i ate of half-cooked
auroch steak and a stew which may have been made
of snakes for many of the long round pieces of
meat suggested them most nauseatingly

the great labyrinthian cavern

the meal completed they led me well within the
cavern which they lighted with torches stuck in
various crevices in the light of which i saw to my
astonishment that the walls were covered with
paintings and etchings there were aurochs red
deer saber-tooth tiger cave-bear hyaenadon and
many other examples of the fauna of caspak done
the land that time forgot

in colors usually of four shades of brown or
scratched upon the surface of the rock often they
were superimposed upon each other until it re-
quired careful examination to trace out the various
outlines but they all showed a rather remarkable
aptitude for delineation which further fortified
bowens comparisons between these people and the
extinct cro-magnons whose ancient art is still pre-
served in the caverns of niaux and le portel the
band-lu however did not have the bow and arrow
and in this respect they differ from their extinct
progenitors or descendants of western europe

  should any of my friends chance to read the
story of my adventures upon caprona i hope they
will not be bored by these diversions and if they
are i can only say that i am writing my memoirs
principally for my own edification and therefore
setting down those things which interested me par-
ticularly at the time i have no desire that the
general public should ever have access to these
pages but it is possible that my friends may and
also certain savants who are interested and to
them while i do not apologize for my philosophiz-
ing i humbly explain that they are witnessing the
gropings of a finite mind after the infinite the
search for explanations of the inexplicable

  in a far recess of the cavern my captors bade me
halt again my hands were secured and this time
my feet as well during the operation they ques-
tioned me and i was mighty glad that the marked
similarity between the various tribal tongues of
caspak enabled us to understand each other per-
fectly even though they were unable to believe or
even to comprehend the truth of my origin and the
circumstances of my advent in caspak and finally
they left me saying that they would come for me
before the dance of death upon the morrow be-
fore they departed with their torches i saw that
i had not been conducted to the farthest extremity
of the cavern for a dark and gloomy corridor led
beyond my prison room into the heart of the cliff

  i could not but marvel at the immensity of this
great underground grotto already i had traversed
several hundred yards of it from many points of
which other corridors diverged the whole cliff
must be honeycombed with apartments and passages
of which this community occupied but a compara-
tively small part so that the possibility of the
more remote passages being the lair of savage beasts
that had other means of ingress and egress than
that used by the band-lu filled me with dire fore-
bodings

   i believe that i am not ordinarily hysterically ap-
prehensive  yet i must confess that under the condi-
tions with which i was confronted i felt my nerves
to be somewhat shaken on the morrow i was to
die some sort of nameless death for the diversion
of a savage horde but the morrow held fewer ter-
rors for me than the present and i submit to any
fair-minded man if it is not a terrifying thing to
lie bound hand and foot in the stygian blackness
of an immense cave peopled by unknown dangers in
a land overrun by hideous beasts and reptiles of the
greatest ferocity at any moment perhaps at this
very moment some silent-footed beast of prey might
catch my scent where it laired in some contiguous
passage and might creep stealthily upon me i
craned my neck about and stared through the inky

darkness for the twin spots of blazing hate which i
knew would herald the coming of my executioner
so real were the imaginings of my overwrought
brain that i broke into a cold sweat in absolute
conviction that some beast was close before me yet
the hours dragged and no sound broke the gravelike
stillness of the cavern

this goddess in the cave

during that period of eternity many events of
my life passed before my mental vision a vast
parade of friends and occurrences which would be
blotted out forever on the morrow i cursed myself
for the foolish act which had taken me from the
search-party that so depended upon me and i won-
dered what progress if any they had made were
they etill beyond the barrier cliffs awaiting my
return  or had they found a way into caspak  i
felt that the latter would be the truth for the party
was not made up of men easily turned from a pur-
pose quite probable it was that they were already
searching for me but that they would ever find a
trace of me i doubted long since had i come to
the conclusion that it was beyond human prowess
to circle the shores of the inland sea of caspak in
the face of the myriad menaces which lurked in
every shadow by day and by night long since
had i given up any hope of reaching the point where
i had made my entry into the country and so i was
now equally convinced that our entire expedition
had been worse than futile before ever it was con-
ceived since bowen j tyler and his wife could not
by any possibility have survived during all these
long months no more could bradley and his party
of seamen be yet in existence if the superior force
and equipment of my party enabled them to circle
the north end of the sea they might some day
come upon the broken wreck of my plane hanging
in the great tree to the south but long before that
my bones would be added to the litter upon the floor
of this mighty cavern

  and through all my thoughts real and fanciful
moved the image of a perfect girl clear-eyed and
strong and straight and beautiful with the car-
riage of a queen and the supple undulating grace
of a leopard though i loved my friends their fate
seemed of less importance to me than the fate of
this little barbarian stranger for whom i had con-
vinced myself many a time i felt no greater senti-
ment than passing friendship for a fellow-wayfarer
in this land of horrors yet i so worried and
fretted about her and her future that at last i quite
forgot my own predicament though i still struggled
intermittently with my bonds in vain endeavor to
free myself as much however that i might hasten
to her protection as that i might escape the fate
which had been planned for me and while i was
thus engaged and had for the moment forgotten my
apprehensions concerning prowling beasts i was
startled into tense silence by a distinct and unmis-
takable sound coming from the dark corridor
farther toward the heart of the cliff-the sound of
padded feet moving stealthily in my direction

  i believe that never before in all my life even
amidst the terrors of childhood nights have i suf-
fered such a sensation of extreme horror as i did
that moment in which i realized that i must lie
bound and helpless while some horrid beast of prey
amazing stories

crept upon me to devour me in that utter darkness
of the band-lu pits of caspak i reeked with cold
sweat and my flesh crawled-i could feel it crawl
if ever i came nearer to abject cowardice i do not
recall the instance and yet it was not that i was
afraid to die for i had long since given myself up
as lost-a few days of caspak must impress any-
one with the utter nothingness of life the waters
the land the air teem with death and one is always
devoured by some other form of life life is the
cheapest thing in caspak as it is the cheapest thing
on earth and doubtless the cheapest cosmic produc-
tion no i was not afraid to die in fact i prayed
for death that i might be relieved of the frightful-
ness of the interval of life which remained to me-
the waiting the awful waiting for that fearsome
beast to reach me and to strike

  presently it was so close that i could hear its
breathing and then it touched me and leaped quick-
ly back as though it had come upon me unexpect-
edly for long moments no sound broke the sepul-
chral silence of the cave then i heard a movement
on the part of the creature near me and again it
touched me and i felt something like a hairless
hand pass over my face and down until it touched
the collar of my flannel shirt and then subdued
but filled with pent emotion a voice cried tom

  i think i nearly fainted so great was the reac-
tion ajor i managed to say ajor my girl
can it be you

  oh tom she cried again in a trembly little
voice and flung herself upon me sobbing softly i
had not known that ajor could cry

  as she cut away my bonds she told me that from
the entrance to our cave she had seen the band-lu
coming out of the forest with me and she had fol-
lowed until they took me into the cave which she
had seen was upon the opposite side of the cliff in
which ours was located and then knowing that she
could do nothing for me until after the band-lu
slept she had hastened to return to our cave with
difficulty she had reached it after having been
stalked by a cave lion and almost seized i trembled
at the risk she had run

  it had been her intention to wait until after mid-
night when most of the carnivora would have made
their kills and then attempt to reach the cave in
which i was imprisoned and rescue me she ex-
plained that with my rifle and pistol-both of which
she assured me she could use having watched me so
many times-she planned upon frightening the
band-lu and forcing them to give me up brave
little girl she would have risked her life willingly
to save me but some time after she reached our
cave she heard voices from the far recesses within
and immediately concluded that we had but found
another entrance to the caves which the band-lu
occupied upon the other face of the cliff then she
had set out through those winding passages and in
total darkness had groped her way guided solely
by a marvelous sense of direction to where i lay
she had had to proceed with utmost caution lest
she fall into some abyss in the darkness and in
truth she had thrice come upon sheer drops and had
been forced to take the most frightful risks to pass
them i shudder even now as i contemplate what
this girl passed through for my sake and how she
enhanced her peril in loading herself down with
the weight of my arms and ammunition and the

awkwardness of the long rifle which she was unac-
customed to bearing

  i could have knelt and kissed her hand in rever-
ence and gratitude nor am i ashamed to say that
that is precisely what i did after i had been freed
from my bonds and heard the story of her trials
brave little ajor wonder-girl out of the dim un-
thinkable past never before had she been kissed
but she seemed to sense something of the meaning
of the new caress for she leaned forward in the
dark and pressed her own lips to my forehead a
sudden urge surged through me to seize her and
strain her to my bosom and cover her hot young
lips with the kisses of a real love but i did not do
so for i knew that i did not love her and to have
kissed her thus with passion would have been to
inflict a great wrong upon her who had offered her
life for mine

  no ajor should be as safe with me as with her
own mother if she had one which i was inclined to
doubt even though she told me that she had once
been a babe and hidden by her mother i had come
to doubt if there was such a thing as a mother in
caspak a mother such as we know from the bo-lu
to the kro-lu there is no word which corresponds
with our word mother they speak of ata and cor
sva jo meaning reproduction and from the begiv-
ning and point toward the south but no one has a
mother

wandering under ground

after considerable difficulty we gained what we
thought was our cave only to find that it was
not and then we realized that we were lost in the
labyrinthine mazes of the great cavern we re-
traced our steps and sought the point from which
we had started but only succeeded in losing our-
selves the more ajor was aghast-not so much
from fear of our predicament but that she should
have failed in the functioning of that wonderful
sense she possessed in common with most other
creatures caspakian which makes it possible for
them to move unerringly from place to place with-
out compass or guide

  hand in hand we crept along searching for an
opening into the outer world yet realizing that at
each step we might be burrowing more deeply into
the heart of the great cliff or circling futilely in
the vague wandering that could end only in death
and the darkness it was almost palpable and ut-
terly depressing i had matches and in some of
the more difficult places i struck one but we
couldnt afford to waste them and so we groped our
way slowly along doing the best we could to keep
to one general direction in the hope that it would
eventually lead us to an opening into the outer
world when i struck matches i noticed that the
walls bore no paintings nor was there other sign
that man had penetrated this far within the cliff
nor any spoor of animals of other kinds

  it would be difficult to guess at the time we spent
wandering through those black corridors climbing
steep ascents feeling our way along the edges of
bottomless pits never knowing at what moment we
might be plunged into some abyss and always
haunted by the ever-present terror of death by
starvation and thirst as difficult as it was i still
realized that it might have been infinitely worse had
i had another companion than ajor-courageous
the land that time forgot



uncomplaining loyal little ajor she was tired and
hungry and thirsty and she must have been dis-
couraged but she never faltered in her cheerful-
ness i asked her if she was afraid and she replied
that here the wieroo could not get her and that if
she died of hunger she would at least die with me
and she was quite content that such should be her
end at the time i attributed her attitude to some-
thing akin to a doglike devotion to a new master
who had been kind to her i can take oath to the
fact that i did not think it was anything more

  whether we had been imprisoned in the cliff for
a day or a week i could not say nor even now do
i know we became very tired and hungry the
hours dragged we slept at least twice and then
we rose and stumbled on always weaker and weak-
er there were ages during which the trend of the
corridors was always upward it was heartbreak-
ing work for people in the state of exhaustion in
which we then were but we clung tenaciously to it
we stumbled and fell we sank through pure physi-
cal inability to retain our feet but always we man-
aged to rise at last and go on at first wherever it
had been possible we had walked hand in hand lest
we become separated and later when i saw that
ajor was weakening rapidly we went side by side
i supporting her with an arm about her waist i
still retained the heavy burden of my armament
but with the rifle slung to my back my hands were
free when i too showed indisputable evidences of
exhaustion ajor suggested that i lay aside my arms
and ammunition but i told her that as it would
mean certain death for me to traverse caspak with-
out them i might as well take the chance of dying
here in the cave with them for there was the other
chance that we might find our way to liberty

  there came a time when ajor could no longer
walk and then it was that i picked her up in my
arms and carried her she begged me to leave her
saying that after i found an exit i could come
back and get her but she knew and she knew that
i knew that if ever i did leave her i could never
find her again yet she insisted i barely had suf-
ficient strength to take a score of steps at a time
then i would have to sink down and rest for five or
ten minutes i dont know what force urged me on
and kept me going in the face of an absolute con-
viction that my efforts were utterly futile i
counted us already as good as dead but even so
i dragged myself along until the time came when
i could no longer rise but could only crawl along a
few inches at a time dragging ajor beside me
her sweet voice now almost inaudible from weak-
ness implored me to abandon her and save myself-
she seemed to think only of me of course i
couldnt have left her there alone no matter how
much i might have desired to do so but the fact
of the matter was that i didnt desire to leave her
what i said to her then came very simply and nat-
urally to my lips it couldnt very well have been
otherwise i imagine for with death so close i
doubt if people are much inclined to heroics i
would rather not get out at all ajor i said to her
than to get out without you we were resting
against a rocky wall and ajor was leaning against
me her head on my breast i could feel her press
closer to me and one hand stroked my arm in a
weak caress but she didnt say anything nor were
words necessary

daylight in the cavern and a meeting

after a few minutes more rest we started on
again upon our utterly hopeless way but i
soon realized that i was weakening rapidly and
presently i was forced to admit that i was through
its no use ajor i said ive come as far as i
can it may be that if i sleep i can go on again
after but i knew that that was not true and that
the end was near yes sleep said ajor we will
sleep together-forever

  she crept close to me as i lay on the hard floor
and pillowed her head upon my arm with the
little strength which remained to me i drew her up
until our lips touched and then i whispered
good-bye i must have lost consciousness almost
immediately for i recall nothing more until i sud-
denly awoke out of a troubled sleep during which i
dreamed that i was drowning to find the cave
lighted by what appeared to be diffused daylight
and a tiny trickle of water running down the cor-
ridor and forming a puddle in the little depression
in which it chanced that ajor and i lay i turned
my eyes quickly upon ajor fearful for what the
light might disclose but she still breathed though
very faintly then i searched about for an explana-
tion of the light and soon discovered that it came
from about a bend in the corridor just ahead of us
and at the top of a steep incline and instantly i
realized that ajor and i had stumbled by night al-
most to the portal of salvation had chance taken
us a few yards further up either of the corridors
which diverged from ours just ahead of us we might
have been irrevocably lost we might still be lost
but at least we could die in the light of day out of
the horrid blackness of this terrible cave

  i tried to rise and found that sleep had given me
back a portion of my strength and then i tasted
the water and was further refreshed i shook ajor
gently by the shoulder but she did not open her
eyes and then i gathered a few drops of water in
my cupped palm and let them trickle between her
lips this revived her so that she raised her lids
and when she saw me she smiled

what happened she asked where are we

  we are at the end of the corridor i replied
and daylight is coming in from the outside world
just ahead we are saved ajor

  she sat up then and looked about and then
quite womanlike she burst into tears it was the
reaction of course and then too she was very
weak i took her in my arms and quieted her as
best i could and finally with my help she got to
her feet for she as well as i had found some slight
recuperation in sleep together we staggered up-
ward toward the light and at the first turn we saw
an opening a few yards ahead of us and a leaden
sky beyond-a leaden sky from which was falling a
drizzling rain the author of our little trickling
stream which had given us drink when we were
most in need of it

  the cave had been damp and cold but as we
crawled through the aperture the muggy warmth
of the caspakian air caressed and comforted us
even therain was warmer than the atmosphere of
those dank corridors we had water now and
warmth and i was sure that caspak would soon
offer us meat or fruit but as we came to where we
could look about we saw that we were upon the


amazing stories

summit of the cliffs where there seemed little rea-
son to expect game however there were trees and
among them we soon descried edible fruits with
which we broke our long fast

chapter iv

we spent two days upon the cliff-top rest-
ing and recuperating there was some
small game which gave us meat and the
little pools of rainwater were sufficient to quench
our thirst the sun came out a few hours after
we emerged from the cave and in its warmth we
soon cast off the gloom which our recent experi-
ences had saddled upon us

  upon the morning of the third day we set out
to search for a path down to the valley below
us to the north we saw a large pool lying at the
foot of the cliffs and in it we could discern the
women of the band-lu lying in the shallow waters
while beyond and close to the base of the mighty
barrier-cliffs there was a large party of band-lu
warriors going north to hunt we had a splendid
view from our lofty cliff-top dimly to the west
we could see the farther shore of the inland sea
and southwest the large southern island loomed
distinctly before us a little east of north was
the northern island which ajor shuddering whis-
pered was the home of the wieroo-the land of
oo-oh it lay at the far end of the lake and was
barely visible to us being fully sixty miles away

  from our elevation and in a clearer atmosphere
it would have stood out distinctly but the air of
caspak is heavy with moisture with the result that
distant objects are blurred and indistinct ajor
also told me that the mainland east of oo-oh was
her land-the land of the galu she pointed out
the cliffs at its southern boundary which mark the
frontier south of which lies the country of kro-lu
-the archers we now had but to pass through the
balance of the band-lu territory and that of the
kro-lu to be within the confines of her own land
but that meant traversing thirty-five miles of hos-
tile country filled with every imaginable terror and
possibly many beyond the powers of imagination
i would certainly have given a lot for my plane at
that moment for with it twenty minutes would
have landed us within the confines of ajors
country

  we finally found a place where we could slip
over the edge of the cliff to a narrow ledge which
seemed to give evidence of being something of a
game-path to the valley though it apparently had
not been used for some time i lowered ajor at the
end of my rifle and then slid over myself and i am
free to admit that my hair stood on end during the
process for the drop was considerable and the
ledge appallingly narrow with a frightful drop
sheer below down to the rocks at the base of the
cliff but with ajor there to catch and steady me
i made it all right and then we set off down the
trail toward the valley there were two or three
more bad places but for the most part it was an
easy descent and we came to the highest of the
band-lu caves without further trouble here we
went more slowly lest we should be set upon by
some member of the tribe

  we must have passed about half the band-lu
cave-levels before we were accosted and then a

huge fellow stepped out in front of me barring
our further progress

  who are you he asked and then he recognized
me and i him for he had been one of those who
had led me back into the cave and bound me the
night that i had been captured from me his gaze
went to ajor he was a fine-looking man with
clear intelligent eyes a good forehead and superb
physique-by far the highest type of caspakian
i had yet seen barring ajor of course

  you are a true galu he said to ajor but
this man is of a different mold he has the face
of a galu but his weapons and the strange skins
he wears upon his body are not of the galus nor
of caspak who is he

  he is tom replied ajor succinctly

  there is no such people asserted the band-lu
quite truthfully toying with his spear in a most
suggestive manner

evcution of man in caspak

ayty name is tom i explained and i am

  iv from a country beyond caspak i thought
it best to propitiate him if possible because of the
necessity of conserving ammunition as well as to
avoid the loud alarm of a shot which might bring
other band-lu warriors upon us i am from amer-
ica a land of which you never heard and i am
seeking others of my countrymen who are in cas-
pak and from whom i am lost i have no quarrel
with you or your people let us go our way in
peace

  you are going there he asked and pointed
toward the north

  i am i replied

  he was silent for several minutes apparently
weighing some thought in his mind at last he
spoke what is that he asked and what is
that he pointed first to my rifle and then to
my pistol

  they are weapons i replied weapons which
kill at a great distance i pointed to the women
in the pool beneath us with this i said tapping
my pistol i could kill as many of those women as
i cared to without moving a step from where we
now stand

  he looked his incredulity but i went on and
with this-i weighed my rifle at the balance in
the palm of my right hand-i could slay one of
those distant warriors and i waved my left hand
toward the tiny figures of the hunters far to the
north

  the fellow laughed do it he cried derisively
and then it may be that i shall believe the balance
of your strange story

  but i do not wish to kill any of them i re-
plied why should i

  why not he insisted they would have
killed you when they had you prisoner they would
kill you now if they could get their hands on you
and they would eat you into the bargain but i
know why you do not try it-it is because you have
spoken lies your weapon will not kill at a great
distance it is only a queerly wrought club for
all i know you are nothing more than a lowly
bo-lu

  why should you wish me to kill your own
people i asked

  they are no longer my people he replied
the land that time forgot



proudly last night in the very middle of the
night the call came to me like that it came into
my head-and he struck his hands together
smartly once-that i had risen i have been wait-
ing for it and expecting it for a long time today
i am a kro-lu today i go out into the coslupak
unpeopled country or literally no mans land
between the band-lu and the kro-lu and there i
fashion my bow and my arrows and my shield
there i hunt the red deer for the leathern jerkin
which is the badge of my new estate when these
things are done i can go to the chief of the kro-lu
and he dare not refuse me that is why you may
kill those low band-lu if you wish to live for i am
in a hurry

  but why do you wish to kill me i asked

  he looked puzzled and finally gave it up i do
not know he admitted it is the way in caspak
if we do not kill we shall be killed therefore it is
wise to kill first whoever does not belong to ones
own people this morning i hid in my cave till
the others were gone upon the hunt for i knew
that they would know at once that i had become a
kro-lu and would kill me they will kill me if they
find me in the coslupak so will the kro-lu if they
come upon me before i have won my kro-lu weapons
and jerkin you would kill me if you could and
that is the reason i know that you speak lies when
you say that your weapons will kill at a great dis-
tance would they you would long since have killed
me come i have no more time to waste in words
i will spare the woman and take her with me to the
kro-lu for she is comely and with that he ad-
vanced upon me with raised spear

the cave lion

my rifle was at my hip at the ready he was
so close that i did not need to raise it to my
shoulder having but to pull the trigger to send
him into kingdom come whenever i chose but yet
i hesitated it was difficult to bring myself to take
a human life i could feel no enmity toward this
savage barbarian who acted almost as wholly upon
instinct as might a wild beast and to the last mo-
ment i was determined to seek some way to avoid
what now seemed inevitable ajor stood at my
shoulder her knife ready in her hand and a sneer
on her lips at his suggestion that he would take her
with him

  just as i thought i should have to fire a chorus
of screams broke from the women beneath us i
saw the man halt and glance downward and follow-
ing his example my eyes took in the panic and its
cause the women had evidently been quitting the
pool and slowly returning toward the caves when
they were confronted by a monstrous cave-lion
which stood directly between them and their cliffs
in the center of the narrow path that led down to
the pool among the tumbled rocks screaming the
women were rushing madly back to the pool

  it will do them no good remarked the man a
trace of excitement in his voice it will do them
no good for the lion will wait until they come out
and take as many as he can carry away and there
is one there he added a trace of sadness in his
tone who i hoped would soon follow me to the
kro-lu together have we come up from the be-
ginning he raised his spear above his head and

poised it ready to hurl downward at the lion she
is nearest to him he muttered he will get her
and she will never come to me among the kro-lu
or ever thereafter it is useless no warrior lives
who could hurl a weapon so great a distance

  but even as he spoke i was leveling my rifle upon
the great brute below and as he ceased speaking i
squeezed the trigger my bullet must have struck
to a hair the point at which i had aimed for it
smashed the brutes spine back of his shoulders and
tore on through his heart dropping him dead in his
tracks for a moment the women were as terrified
by the report of the rifle as they had been by the
menace of the lion but when they saw that the
loud noise had evidently destroyed their enemy
they came creeping cautiously back to examine the
carcass

  the man toward whom i had immediately turned
after firing lest he should pursue his threatened
attack stood staring at me in amazement and ad-
miration

  why he asked if you could do that did you
not kill me long before

  i told you i replied that i had no quarrel
with you i do not care to kill men with whom i have
no quarrel

  but he could not seem to get the idea through his
head i can believe now that you are not of cas-
pak he admitted for no caspakian would have
permitted such an opportunity to escape him
this however i found later to be an exaggeration
as the tribes of the west coast and even the kro-lu
of the east coast are far less bloodthirsty than he
would have had me believe and your weapon
he continued you spoke true words when i
thought you spoke lies and then suddenly let
us be friends

  i turned to ajor can i trust him i asked

  yes she replied why not has he not
asked to be friends

  i was not at the time well enough acquainted
with caspakian ways to know that truthfulness and
loyalty are two of the strongest characteristics of
these primitive people they are not sufficiently
cultured to have become adepts in hypocrisy trea-
son and dissimulation there are of course a few
exceptions

  we can go north together continued the war-
rior i will fight for you and you can fight for
me until death will i serve you for you have
saved so-al whom i had given up as dead he
threw down his spear and covered both his eyes
with the palms of his two hands i looked inquir-
ingly toward ajor who explained as best she could
that this was the form of the caspakian oath of
allegiance you need never fear him after this
she concluded

  what should i do i asked

  take his hands down from before his eyes and
return his spear to him she explained

  i did as she bade and the man seemed very
pleased i then asked what i should have done had
i not wished to accept his friendship they told
me that had i walked away the moment that i was
out of sight of the warrior we would have become
deadly enemies again but i could so easily have
killed him as he stood there defenseless i ex-
claimed


amazing stories

  yes replied the warrior but no man with
good sense blinds his eyes before one whom he does
not trust

  it was rather a decent compliment and it taught
me just how much i might rely on the loyalty of
my new friend i was glad to have him with us
for he knew the country and was evidently a fearless
warrior i wished that i might have recruited a
battalion like him

  as the women were now approaching the cliffs
to-mar the warrior suggested that we make our
way to the valley before they could intercept us
as they might attempt to detain us and were almost
certain to set upon ajor so we hastened down the
narrow path reaching the foot of the cliffs but a
short distance ahead of the women they called
after us to stop but we kept on at a rapid walk
not wishing to have any trouble with them which
could only result in the death of some of them

  we had proceeded about a mile when we heard
some one behind us calling to-mar by name and
when we stopped and looked around we saw a
woman running rapidly toward us as she ap-
proached nearer i could see that she was a very
comely creature and like all her sex that i had seen
in caspak apparently young

  it is so-al exclaimed to-mar is she mad
that she follows me thus

  in another moment the young woman stopped
panting before us she paid not the slightest at-
tention to ajor or me but devouring to-mar with
her sparkling eyes she cried i have risen i
have risen

  so-al was all that the man could say

  yes she went on the call came to me just be-
fore i quit the pool but i did not know that it had
come to you i can see it in your eyes to-mar my
to-mar we shall go on together and she threw
herself into his arms

  it was a very affecting sight for it was evident
that these two had been mates for a long time and
that they had each thought that they were about to
be separated by that strange law of evolution which
holds good in caspak and which was slowly unfold-
ing before my incredulous mind i did not then
comprehend even a tithe of the wondrous process
which goes on eternally within the confines of
capronas barrier cliffs nor am i too sure that i do
even now

  to-mar explained to so-al that it was i who had
killed the cave-lion and saved her life and that
ajor was my woman and thus entitled to the same
loyalty which was my due

  at first ajor and so-al were like a couple of
stranger cats on a back fence but soon they began
to accept each other under something of an armed
truce and later became fast friends so-al was a
mighty fine-looking girl built like a tigress as to
strength and sinuosity but withal sweet and wom-
anly ajor and i came to be very fond of her and
she was i think equally fond of us to-mar was
very much of a man-a savage if you will but none
the less a man

  finding that traveling in company with to-mar
made our journey both easier and safer ajor and
i did not continue on our way alone while the novi-
tiates delayed their approach to the kro-lu country
in order that they might properly fit themselves in

the matter of arms and apparel but remained with
them thus we became well acquainted-to such
an extent that we looked forward with regret to the
day when they took their places among their new
comrades and we should be forced to continue upon
our way alone it was a matter of much concern to
to-mar that the kro-lu would undoubtedly not re-
ceive ajor and me in a friendly manner and that
consequently we should have to avoid these people

  it would have been very helpful to us could we
have made friends with them as their country
abutted directly upon that of the galus their
friendship would have meant that ajors dangers
were practically passed and that i had accomplished
fully one-half of my long journey in view of what
i had passed through i often wondered what chance
i had to complete that journey in search of my
friends the further south i should travel on the
west side of the island the more frightful would
the dangers become as i neared the stamping-
grounds of the more hideous reptilia and the haunts
of the alus and the ho-lu all of which were at the
southern half of the island and then if i should not
find the members of my party what was to become
of me i could not live for long in any portion of
caspak with which i was familiar the moment my
ammunition was exhausted i should be as good as
dead

  there was a chance that the galus would receive
me but even ajor could not say definitely whether
they would or no and even provided they would
could i retrace my steps from the beginning after
failing to find my own people and return to the
far northern land of galus i doubted it how-
ever i was learning from ajor who was more or
less of a fatalist a philosophy which was as neces-
sary in caspak to peace of mind as is faith to the
devout christian of the outer world

chapter v

we were sitting before a little fire inside a
safe grotto one night shortly after we had
quit the cliff-dwellings of the band-lu when
so-al raised a question which it had never occurred
to me to propound to ajor she asked her why she
had left her own people and how she had come so
far south as the country of the alus where i had
found her

  at first ajor hesitated to explain but at last she
consented and for the first time i heard the com-
plete story of her origin and experiences for my
benefit she entered into greater detail of explanation
than would have been necessary had i been a native
caspakian

  i am a cos-ata-lo commenced ajor and then
she turned toward me a cos-ata-lo my tom is a
woman lo who did not come from an egg and
thus on up from the beginning cor svc jo i
was a babe at my mothers breast only among the
galus are such and then but infrequently the
wieroo get most of us but my mother hid me until
i had attained such size that the wieroo could not
readily distinguish me from one who had come up
from the beginning i knew both my mother and
my father as only such as i may my father is
high chief among the galus his name is jor and
both he and my mother came up from the begin-
ning but one of them probably my mother had
the land that time forgot



completed the seven cycles approximately seven
hundred years with the result that their off-
spring might be cos-ata-lo or born as are all the
children of your race my tom as you tell me is the
fact i was therefore apart from my fellows in that
my children would probably be as i of a higher
state of evolution and so i was sought by the men
of my people but none of them appealed to me i
cared for none the most persistent was du-seen
a huge warrior of whom my father stood in con-
siderable fear since it was quite possible that du-
seen could wrest from him his chieftainship of the
galus he has a large following of the newer
galus those most recently come up from the kro-lu
and as this class is usually much more powerful
numerically than the older galus and as du-seens
ambition knows no bounds we have for a long time
been expecting him to find some excuse for a break
with jor the high chief my father

  a further complication lay in the fact that du-
seen wanted me while i would have none of him
and then came evidence to my fathers ears that he
was in league with the wieroo a hunter returning
late at night came trembling to my father saying
that he had seen du-seen talking with a wieroo in
a lonely spot far from the village and that plainly
he had heard the words if you will help me i
will help you-i will deliver into your hands all
cos-ata-lo among the galus now and hereafter but
for that service you must slay jor the high chief
and bring terror and confusion to his followers

  now when my father heard this he was angry
but he was also afraid-afraid for me who am
cos-ata-lo he called me to him and told me what
he had heard pointing out two ways n which we
might frustrate du-seen the first was that i go
to du-seen as his mate after which he would be
loath to give me into the hands of the wieroo or to
further abide by the wicked compact he had made
-a compact which would doom his own offspring
who would doubtless be as am i their mother the
alternative was flight until du-seen should have
been overcome and punished i chose the latter
and fled toward the south beyond the confines of
the galu country is little danger from the wieroo
who seek ordinarily only galus of the highest
orders there are two excellent reasons for this
one is that from the beginning of time jealousy has
existed between the wieroo and the galus as to
which constituted the higher order and therefore
which would eventually dominate the world it
seems generally conceded that that race which first
reaches a point of evolution which permits them
to produce young of their own species and of both
sexes must dominate all other creatures the
wieroo first began to produce their own kind-
after which evolution from galu to wieroo ceased
gradually until now it is unknown but the wieroo
produce only males-which is why they steal our
female young and by stealing cos-ata-lo they in-
crease their own chances of eventually reproducing
both sexes and at the same time lessen ours al-
ready the galus produce both male and female but
so carefully do the wieroo watch us that few of
the males ever grow to manhood while even fewer
are the females that are not stolen away it is in-
deed a strange condition for while our greatest

enemies hate and fear us they dare not exterminate
us knowing that they too would become extinct but
for us

  ah but could we once get a start i am sure that
when all were true cos-ata-lo there would have been
evolved at last the true dominant race before which
all the world would be forced to bow

a strange tale of trouble continued

ajor always spoke of the world as though noth-
ing existed beyond caspak she could not
seem to grasp the truth of my origin or the fact
that there were countless other peoples outside her
stern barrier-cliffs she apparently felt that i
came from an entirely different world where it
was and how i came to caspak from it were mat-
ters quite beyond her with which she refused to
trouble her pretty head

  well she continued and so i ran away to
hide intending to pass the cliffs to the south of
galu and find a retreat in the kro-lu country it
would be dangerous but there seemed no other way

  the third night i took refuge in a large cave
in the cliffs at the edge of my own country upon
the following day i would cross over into the kro-lu
country where i felt that i should be reasonably
safe from the wieroo though menaced by countless
other dangers however to a cos-ata-lo any fate
is preferable to that of falling into the clutches of
the frightful wieroo from whose land none returns

  i had been sleeping peacefully for several hours
when i was awakened by a slight noise within the
cavern the moon was shining brightly illumining
the entrance against which i saw silhouetted the
dread figure of a wieroo there was no escape
the cave was shallow the entrance narrow i lay
very still hoping against hope that the creature
had but paused here to rest and might soon depart
without discovering me yet all the while i knew
that he came seeking me

  i waited scarce breathing watching the thing
creep stealthily toward me its great eyes luminous
in the darkness of the caves interior and at last
i knew that those eyes were directed upon me for
the wieroo can see in the darkness better than even
the lion or the tiger but a few feet separated us
when i sprang to my feet and dashed madly toward
my menacer in a vain effort to dodge past him and
reach the outside world it was madness of course
for even had i succeeded temporarily the wieroo
would have followed me and swooped down upon
me from above as it was he reached forth and
seized me and though i struggled he overpowered
me in the duel his long white robe was nearly
torn from him and he became very angry so that
he trembled and beat his wings together in his rage

  he asked me my name but i would not answer
him and that angered him still more at last he
dragged me to the entrance of the cave lifted me
in his arms spread his great wings and leaping into
the air flapped dismally through the night i saw
the moonlit landscape sliding away beneath me and
then we were out above the sea and on our way to
oo-oh the country of the wieroo

  the dim outlines of oo-oh were unfolding below
us when there came from above a loud whirring of
giant wings the wieroo and i glanced up simul-


amazing stories

taneously to see a pair of huge jo-oos flying rep-
tiles-pterodactyls swooping down upon us the
wieroo wheeled and dropped almost to sea-level
and then raced southward in an effort to outdistance
our pursuers the great creatures notwithstand-
ing their enormous weight are swift on their
wings but the wieroo are swifter even with my
added weight the creature that bore me maintained
his lead though he could not increase it faster
than the fastest wind we raced through the night
southward along the coast sometimes we rose to
great heights where the air was chill and the
world below but a blur of dim outlines but always
the jo-oos stuck close behind us

  i knew that we had covered a great distance
for the rush of the wind by my face attested the
speed of our progress but i had no idea where we
were when at last i realized that the wieroo was
weakening one of the jo-oos gained on us and
succeeded in heading us so that my captor had to
turn in toward the coast further and further they
forced him to the left lower and lower he sank
more labored was his breathing and weaker the
stroke of his once powerful wings we were not
ten feet above the ground when they overtook us
and at the edge of a forest one of them seized
the wieroo by his right wing and in an effort to
free himself he loosed his grasp upon me drop-
ping me to earth like a frightened ecca i leaped
to my feet and raced for the sheltering sanctuary
of the forest where i knew neither could follow
or seize me then i turned and looked back to see
two great reptiles tear my abductor asunder and
devour him on the spot

  i was saved yet i felt that i was lost how
far i was from the country of the galus i could but
guess nor did it seem probable that i ever could
make my way in safety to my native land

  day was breaking soon the carnivora would
stalk forth for their first kill i was armed only
with my knife about me was a strange landscape
-the flowers the trees the grasses even were
different from those of my northern world and pres-
ently there appeared before me a creature fully as
hideous as the wieroo-a hairy man-thing that
barely walked erect i shuddered and then i fled
through the hideous dangers that my forbears had
endured in the earlier stages of their human evo-
lution i fled and always pursuing was the hairy
monster that had discovered me later he was
joined by others of his kind they were the speech-
less men the alus from whom you rescued me my
tom from then on you know the story of my
adventures and from the first i would endure them
all again because they led me to you

  it was very nice of her to say that and i appre-
ciated it i felt that she was a mighty nice little
girl whose friendship anyone might be glad to have
but i wished that when she touched me those
peculiar thrills would not run through me it was
most discomforting because it reminded me of
love and i knew that i never could love this half-
baked little barbarian i was very much interested
in her account of the wieroo which up to this time
i had considered a purely mythological creature
but ajor shuddered so at even the least mention
of the name that i was loath to press the subject

upon her and so the wieroo still remained a mys-
tery to me

the caspakian races explained

while the wieroo interested me greatly i had
little time to think about them as our waking
hours were filled with the necessities of existence-
the constant battle for survival which is the chief
occupation of the caspakians to-mar and so-al
were now about fitted for their advent into kro-lu
society and must therefore leave us as we could
not accompany them without incurring great dan-
ger ourselves and running the chance of endanger-
ing them but each swore to be always our friend
and assured us that should we need their aid at
any time we had but to ask it nor could i doubt
their sincerity since we had been so instrumental
in bringing them safely upon their journey toward
the kro-lu village

  this was our last day together in the after-
noon we should separate to-mar and so-al going
directly to the kro-lu village while ajor and i
made a detour to avoid a conflict with the archers
the former both showed evidence of nervous appre-
hension as the time approached for them to make
their entry into the village of their new people and
yet both were very proud and happy they told
us that they would be well received as additions to
a tribe always are welcomed and the more so as
the distance from the beginning increased the
higher tribes or races being far weaker numerically
than the lower the southern end of the island
fairly swarms with the ho-lu or apes next above
these are the alus who are slightly fewer in num-
bers than the ho-lu and again there are fewer
bo-lu than alus and fewer sto-lu than bo-lu thus
it goes until the kro-lu are fewer in number than
any of the others and here the law reverses for
the galus outnumber the kro-lu as ajor ex-
plained it to me the reason for this is that as evo-
lution practically ceases with the galus there is
no loss among them on this score for even the cos-
ata-lo are still considered galus and remain with
them and galus come up both from the west and
east coasts there are too fewer carnivorous rep-
tiles at the north end of the island and not so
many of the great and ferocious members of the
cat family as take their hideous toll of life among
the races further south

  by now i was obtaining some idea of the cas-
pakian scheme of evolution which partly accounted
for the lack of young among the races i had so far
seen coming up from the beginning the cas-
pakian passes during a single existence through
the various stages of evolution or at least many of
them through which the human race has passed
during the countless ages since life first stirred
upon a new world but the question which continued
to puzzle me was what creates life at the begin-
ning cor sva jo

  i had noticed that as we traveled northward from
the alus country the land had gradually risen until
we were now several hundred feet above the level
of the inland sea ajor told me that the galu
country was still higher and considerably colder
which accounted for the scarcity of reptiles the
change in form and kinds of the lower animals was
even more marked than the evolutionary stages of
the land that time forgot



man the diminutive ecca or small horse became
a rough-coated and sturdy little pony in the kro-lu
country i saw a greater number of small lions and
tigers though many of the huge ones still per-
sisted while the wooly mammoth was more in evi-
dence as were several varieties of the labyrinth-
adonta these creatures from which god save me
i should have expected to find further south but
for some unaccountable reason they gain their
greatest bulk in the kro-lu and galu countries
though fortunately they are rare i rather imag-
ine that they are a very early form of life which
is rapidly nearing extinction in caspak though
wherever they are found they constitute a menace
to all forms of life

  it was mid-afternoon when to-mar and so-al
bade us good-bye we were not far from the
kro-lu village in fact we had approached it much
closer than we had intended and now ajor and i
were to make a detour toward the sea while our
companions went directly in search of the kro-lu
chief

  ajor and i had gone perhaps a mile or two and
were just about to emerge from a dense wood when
i saw that ahead of us which caused me to draw
back into concealment at the same time pushing
ajor behind me what i saw was a party of band-
lu warriors-large fierce-appearing men from the
direction of their march i saw that they wrere re-
turning to their caves and that if we remained
where we were they would pass without dis-
covering us

  presently ajor nudged me they have a pris-
oner she whispered he is a kro-lu

a prisoner of a higher race

and then i saw him the first fully developed
kro-lu i had seen he was a fine-looking sav-
age all and straight with a regal carriage to-
mar was a handsome fellow but this kro-lu showed
plainly in his every physical attribute a higher
plane of evolution while to-mar was just enter-
ing the kro-lu sphere this man it seemed to me
must be close indeed to the next stage of his de-
velopment which would see him an envied galu

they will kill him i whispered to ajor

  the dance of death she replied and i shud-
dered so recently had i escaped the same fate it
seemed cruel that one who must have passed safely
up through all the frightful stages of human evo-
lution within caspak should die at the very foot
of his goal i raised my rifle to my shoulder and
took careful aim at one of the band-lu if i hit
him i would hit two for another was directly be-
hind the first

  ajor touched my arm what would you do
she asked they are all our enemies

  i am going to save him from the dance of
death i replied enemy or no enemy and i
squeezed the trigger at the report the two band-
lu lunged forward upon their faces i handed my
rifle to ajor and drawing my pistol stepped out
in full view of the startled party the band-lu did
not run away as had some of the lower orders of
caspakians at the sound of the rifle instead the
moment they saw me they let out a series of
demoniac war-cries and raising their spears above
their heads charged me

  the kro-lu stood silent and statuesque watching
the proceedings he made no attempt to escape
though his feet were not bound and none of the
warriors remained to guard him there were ten
of the band-lu coming for me i dropped three of
them with my pistol as rapidly as a man might
count to three and then my rifle spoke close to my
left shoulder and another of them stumbled and
rolled over and over upon the ground plucky little
ajor she had never fired a shot before in all her
life though i had taught her to sight and aim and
how to squeeze the trigger instead of pulling it
she had practised these new accomplishments often
but little had i thought they would make a marks-
man of her so quickly

  with six of their fellows put out of the fight so
easily the remaining six sought cover behind some
low bushes and commenced a council of war i
wished that they would go away as i had no am-
munition to waste and i was fearful that should
they institute another charge some of them would
reach us for they were already quite close sud-
denly one of them rose and launched his spear it
was the most marvelous exhibition of speed i have
ever witnessed it seemed to me that he had scarce
gained an upright position when the weapon was
halfway upon its journey speeding like an arrow
toward ajor and then it was with that little life
in danger that i made the best shot i have ever
made in my life i took no conscious aim it was
as though my subconscious mind impelled by a
stronger power even than that of self-preservation
directed my hand ajor was in danger simul-
taneously with the thought my pistol flew to posi-
tion a streak of incandescent powder marked the
path of the bullet from its muzzle and the spear
its point shattered was deflected from its path
with a howl of dismay the six band-lu rose from
their shelter and raced away toward the south

  i turned toward ajor she was very white and
wide-eyed for the clutching fingers of death had
all but seized her but a little smile came to her
lips and an expression of great pride to her eyes
my tom she said and took my hand in hers
that was all-my tom and a pressure of the
hand her tom something stirred within my
bosom was it exaltation or was it consternation
impossible i turned away almost brusquely

  come i said and strode off toward the kro-lu
prisoner

  the kro-lu stood watching us with stolid indiffer-
ence i presume that he expected to be killed but
if he did he showed no outward sign of fear his
eyes indicating his greatest interest were fixed
upon my pistol or the rifle which ajor still carried
i cut his bonds with my knife as i did so an
expression of surprise tinged and animated the
haughty reserve of his countenance he eyed me
quizzically

  what are you going to do with me he asked

  you are free i replied go home if you
wish

  why dont you kill me he inquired i am
defenseless

  why should i kill you i have risked my life
and that of this young lady to save your life why
therefore should i now take it of course i
didnt say young lady as there is no caspakian


amazing stories

equivalent for that term but i have to allow my-
self considerable latitude in the translation of cas-
pakian conversation to speak always of a beau-
tiful young girl as a she may be literal but it
seems far from gallant

the enmity of the different races

the kro-lu concentrated his steady level gaze
upon me for at least a full minute then he
spoke again

  who are you man of strange skins he asked
your she is galu but you are neither galu nor
kro-lu nor band-lu nor any other sort of man
which i have seen before tell me from whence
comes so mighty a warrior and so generous a foe
it is a long story i replied but suffice it to
say that i am not of caspak i am a stranger here
and-let this sink in-i am not a foe i have no
wish to be an enemy of any man in caspak with
the possible exception of the galu warrior du-seen
du-seen he exclaimed you are an enemy
of du-seen and why

  because he would harm ajor i replied you
know him

  he cannot know him said ajor du-seen rose
from the kro-lu long ago taking a new name as
all do when they enter a new sphere he cannot
know him as there is no intercourse between the
kro-lu and the galu

  the warrior smiled du-seen rose not so long
ago he said that i do not recall him well and
recently he has taken it upon himself to abrogate
the ancient laws of caspak he has had intercourse
with the kro-lu du-seen would be chief of the
galus and he has come to the kro-lu for help
ajor was aghast the thing was incredible
never had kro-lu and galu had friendly relations
by the savage laws of caspak they were deadly
enemies for only so can the several races maintain
their individuality

  will the kro-lu join him asked ajor will
they invade the country of jor my father

  the younger kro-lu favor the plan replied the
warrior since they believe they will thus become
galus immediately they hope to span the long
years of change through which they must pass in
the ordinary course of events and at a single stride
become galus we of the older kro-lu tell them
that though they occupy the land of the galu and
wear the skins and ornaments of the golden people
still they will not be galus till the time arrives
that they are ripe to rise we also tell them that
even then they will never become a true galu race
since there will still be those among them who can
never rise it is all right to raid the galu country
occasionally for plunder as our people do but to
attempt to conquer it and hold it is madness for
my part i have been content to wait until the call
came to me i feel that it cannot now be long
what is your name asked ajor

  chal-az replied the man

  you are chief of the kro-lu ajor continued
no it is al-tan who is chief of the kro-lu of
the east answered chal-az

  and he is against this plan to invade my
fathers country

  unfortunately he is rather in favor of it re-

plied the man since he has about come to the con-
clusion that he is batu he has been chief ever
since before i came up from the band-lu and i
can see no change in him in all those years in
fact he still appears to be more band-lu than
kro-lu however he is a good chief and a mighty
warrior and if du-seen persuades him to his cause
the galus may find themselves under a kro-lu
chieftain before long-du-seen as well as the
others for al-tan would never consent to occupy
a subordinate position and once he plants a vic-
torious foot in galu he will not withdraw it with-
out a struggle

  i asked them what batu meant as i had not be-
fore heard the word literally translated it is
equivalent to through finished done-for as applied
to an individuals evolutionary progress in caspak
and with this information was developed the inter-
esting fact that not every individual is capable of
rising through every stage to that of galu some
never progress beyond the alu stage others stop
as bo-lu as sto-lu as band-lu or as kro-lu the
ho-iu of the first generation may rise to become
alus the alus of the second generation may become
bo-lu while it requires three generations of bo-lu
to become band-lu and so on until the kro-lus
parent on one side must be of the sixth generation

  it was not entirely plain to me even with this
explanation since i couldnt understand how there
could be different generations of peoples who ap-
parently had no offspring yet i was commencing
to get a slight glimmer of the strange laws which
govern propagation and evolution in this weird
land already i knew that the warm pools which
always lie close to every tribal abiding-place were
closely linked with the caspakian scheme of evolu-
tion and that the daily immersion of the females
in the greenish slimy water was in response to
some natural law since neither pleasure nor clean-
liness could be derived from what seemed almost a
religious rite yet i was still at sea and seemingly
ajor could not enlighten me since she was compelled
to use words which i could not understand and
which it was impossible for her to explain the
meanings of

she is mine a competition

as we stood talking we were suddenly startled
by a commotion in the bushes and among the
boles of the trees surrounding us and simultane-
ously a hundred kro-lu warriors appeared in a
rough circle about us they greeted chal-az with
a volley of questions as they approached slowly from
all sides their heavy bows fitted with long sharp
arrows upon ajor and me they looked with covet-
ousness in the one instance and suspicion in the
other but after they had heard chal-azs story
their attitude was more friendly a huge savage
did all the talking he was a mountain of a man
yet perfectly proportioned

  this is al-tan the chief said chal-az by way
of introduction then he told something of my
story and al-tan asked me many questions of the
land from which i came the warriors crowded
around close to hear my replies and there were
many expressions of incredulity as i spoke of what
was to them another world of the yacht which had
the land that time forgot



brought me over vast waters and of the plane that
had borne me jo-oo-like over the summit of the
barrier-cliffs it was the mention of the hydro-
aeroplane which precipitated the first outspoken
skepticism and then ajor came to my defense

  i saw it with my own eyes she exclaimed i
saw him flying through the air in battle with a
jo-oo the alus were chasing me and they saw
and ran away

  whose is this she demanded al-tan suddenly
his eyes fixed fiercely upon ajor

  for a moment there was silence ajor looked up
at me a hurt and questioning expression on her
face whose she is this repeated al-tan

  she is mine i replied though what force it
was that impelled me to say it i could not have
told but an instant later i was glad that i had
spoken the words for the reward of ajors proud
and happy face was reward indeed

  al-tan eyed her for several minutes and then
turned to me can you keep her he asked just
the tinge of a sneer upon his face

  i laid my palm upon the grip of my pistol and
answered that i could he saw the move glanced
at the butt of the automatic where it protruded
from its holster and smiled then he turned and
raising his great bow fitted an arrow and drew
the shaft far back his warriors supercilious
smiles upon their faces stood silently watching
him his bow was the longest and the heaviest
among them all a mighty man indeed must he be
to bend it yet al-tan drew the shaft back until stone
point touched his left forefinger and he did it with
consummate ease then he raised the shaft to the
level of his right eye held it there for an instant
and released it when the arrow stopped half its
length piotruded from the opposite side of a six-
inch tree fifty feet way al-tan and his warriors
turned toward me with expressions of immense sat-
isfaction upon their faces and then apparently for
ajors benefit the chieftain swaggered to and fro
a couple of times swinging his great arms and his
bulky shoulders for all the world like a drunken
prize-fighter at a beach dance-hall

  i saw that some reply was necessary and so in
a single motion i drew my gun dropped it on the
still quivering arrow and pulled the trigger at
the sound of the report the kro-lu leaped back and
raised their weapons but as i was smiling they
took heart and lowered them again following my
eyes to the tree the shaft of their chief was gone
and through the bole was a little round hole mark-
ing the path of my bullet it was a good shot if
i do say it myself as shouldnt but necessity
must have guided that bullet i simply had to make
a good shot that i might immediately establish my
position among those savage and warlike caspakians
of the sixth sphere that it had its effect was im-
mediately noticeable but i am none too sure that
it helped my cause with al-tan whereas he might
have condescended to tolerate me as a harmless and
interesting curiosity he now by the change in his
expression appeared to consider me in a new and
unfavorable light nor can i wonder knowing this
type as i did for had i not made him ridiculous in
the eyes of his warriors beating him at his own
game what king savage or civilized could con-
done such impudence seeing his black scowls i

deemed it expedient especially on ajors account to
terminate the interview and continue upon our way
but when i would have done so al-tan detained us
with a gesture and his warriors pressed around us

a duel with a saber-tooth tiger

ccttthat is the meaning of this i demanded
vv and before al-tan could reply chal-az
raised his voice in our behalf

  is this the gratitude of a kro-lu chieftain al-
tan he asked to one who has served you by sav-
ing one of your warriors from the enemy-saving
him from the death dance of the band-lu

  al-tan was silent for a moment and then his
brow cleared and the faint imitation of a pleasant
expression struggled for existence as he said
the stranger will not be harmed i wished only
to detain him that he may be feasted tonight in
the village of al-tan the kro-lu in the morning
he may go his way al-tan will not hinder him

  i was not entirely reassured but i wanted to
see the interior of the kro-lu village and anyway
i knew that if al-tan intended treachery i would
be no more in his power in the morning than i now
was-in fact during the night i might find oppor-
tunity to escape with ajor while at the instant
neither of us could hope to escape unscathed from
the encircling warriors therefore in order to dis-
arm him of any thought that i might entertain
suspicion as to his sincerity i promptly and cour-
teously accepted his invitation his satisfaction
was evident and as we set off toward his village
he walked beside me asking many questions as to
the country from which i came its peoples and
their customs he seemed much mystified by the
fact that we could walk abroad by day or night
without fear of being devoured by wild beasts or
savage reptiles and when i told him of the great
armies which we maintained his simple mind could
not grasp the fact that they existed solely for the
slaughtering of human beings

  i am glad he said that i do not dwell in
your country among such savage peoples here
in caspak men fight with men when they meet-
men of different races-but their weapons are first
for the slaying of beasts in the chase and in de-
fense we do not fashion weapons solely for the
killing of man as do your peoples your country
must indeed be a savage country from which you
are fortunate to have escaped to the peace and
security of caspak

  here was a new and refreshing viewpoint nor
could i take exception to it after what i had told
al-tan of the great war which had been raging in
europe for over two years before i left home

  on the march to the kro-lu village we were con-
tinually stalked by innumerable beasts of prey and
three times we were attacked by frightful crea-
tures but al-tan took it all as a matter of course
rushing forward with raised spear or sending a
heavy shaft into the body of the attacker and then
returning to our conversation as though no inter-
ruption had occurred twice were members of his
band mauled and one was killed by a huge and
bellicose rhinoceros but the instant the action was
over it was as though it never had occurred the
dead man was stripped of his belongings and left


amazing stories

where he had died the carnivora would take care
of his burial the trophies that these kro-lu left
to the meat-eaters would have turned an english
big-game hunter green with envy they did it is
true cut all the edible parts from the rhino and
carry them home but already they were pretty
well weighted down with the spoils of the chase and
only the fact that they are particularly fond of
rhino-meat caused them to do so

  they left the hide on the pieces they selected as
they use it for sandals shield-covers the hilts of
their knives and various other purposes where
tough hide is desirable i was much interested in
their shields especially after i saw one used in
defense against the attack of a saber-tooth tiger
the huge creature had charged us without warning
from a clump of dense bushes where it was lying
up after eating it was met with an avalanche of
spears some of which passed entirely through its
body with such force were they hurled the
charge was from a very short distance requiring
the use of the spear rather than the bow and arrow
but after the launching of the spears the men not
directly in the path of the charge sent bolt after
bolt into the great carcass with almost incredible
rapidity the beast screaming with pain and
rage bore down upon chal-az while i stood helpless
with my rifle for fear of hitting one of the war-
riors who were closing in upon it but chal-az was
ready throwing aside his bow he crouched be-
hind his large oval shield in the center of which
was a hole about six inches in diameter the shield
was held by tight loops to his left arm while in
his right hand he grasped his heavy knife
bristling with spears and arrows the great cat
hurled itself upon the shield and down went chal-
az upon his back with the shield entirely covering
him the tiger clawed and bit at the heavy
rhinoceros hide with which the shield was faced
while chal-az through the round hole in the shields
center plunged his blade repeatedly into the vitals
of the savage animal doubtless the battle would
have gone to chal-az even though i had not inter-
fered but the moment that i saw a clean opening
with no kro-lu beyond i raised my rifle and killed
the beast

the caspak village

when chal-az arose he glanced at the sky
and remarked that it looked like rain the
others already had resumed the march toward the
village the incident was closed for some unac-
countable reason the whole thing reminded me of
a friend of mine who once shot a cat in his back-
yard for three weeks he talked of nothing else

  it was almost dark when we reached the village-
a large palisaded inclosure of several hundred leaf-
thatched huts set in groups of from two to seven
the huts were hexagonal in form and where
grouped were joined so that they resembled the cells
of a beehive one hut meant a warrior and his mate
and each additional hut in a group indicated an
additional female the palisade which surrounded
the village was of logs set close together and woven
into a solid wall with tough creepers which were
planted at their base and trained to weave in and
out to bind the logs together the logs slanted

outward at an angle of about thirty degrees in
which position they were held by shorter logs em-
bedded in the ground at right angles to them and
with their upper ends supporting the longer pieces
a trifle above their centers of equilibrium along
the top of the palisade sharpened stakes had been
driven at all sorts of angles

  the only opening into the inclosure was through
a small aperture three feet wide and three feet high
which was closed from the inside by logs about six
feet long laid horizontally one upon another be-
tween the inside face of the palisade and two other
braced logs which paralleled the face of the wall
upon the inside

  as we entered the village we were greeted by a
not unfriendly crowd of curious warriors and
women to whom chal-az generously explained the
service we had rendered him whereupon they
showered us with the most well-meant attentions
for chal-az it seemed was a most popular member
of the tribe necklaces of lion- and tiger-teeth bits
of dried meat finely tanned hides and earthen pots
beautifully decorated they thrust upon us until we
were loaded down and all the while al-tan glared
balefully upon us seemingly jealous of the atten-
tions heaped upon us because we had served
chal-az

  at last we reached a hut that they set apart for
us and there we cooked our meat and some vege-
tables the women brought us and had milk from
cows-the first i had had in caspak-and cheese
from the milk of wild goats with honey and thin
bread made from wheat flour of their own grinding
and grapes and the fermented juice of grapes it
was quite the most wonderful meal i had eaten since
i quit the toreador and bowen j tylers colored
chef who could make pork-chops taste like chicken
and chicken taste like heaven

chapter vi

after dinner i rolled a cigaret and stretched
myself at ease upon a pile of furs before
the doorway with ajors head pillowed in
my lap and a feeling of great content pervading
me it was the first time since my plane had topped
the barrier-cliffs of caspak that i had felt any sense
of peace or security my hand wandered to the
velvet cheek of the girl i had claimed as mine and
to her luxuriant hair and the golden fillet which
bound it close to her shapely head her slender
fingers groping upward sought mine and drew them
to her lips and then i gathered her in my arms
and crushed her to me smothering her mouth with
a long long kiss it was the first time that pas-
sion had tinged my intercourse with ajor we were
alone and the hut was ours until morning

  but now from beyond the palisade in the direc-
tion of the main gate came the hallooing of men
and the answering calls and queries of the guard
we listened returning hunters no doubt we
heard them enter the village amidst the barking
dogs i have forgotten to mention the dogs of the
kro-lu the village swarmed with them gaunt
wolflike creatures that guarded the herd by day
when it grazed without the palisade ten dogs to
a cow by night the cows were herded in an outer
inclosure roofed against the onslaughts of the car-
the land that time forgot



nivorous cats and the dogs with the exception of
a few were brought into the village these few
well-tested brutes remained with the herd during
the day they fed plentifully upon the beasts of
prey which they killed in protection of the herd
so that their keep amounted to nothing at all

  shortly after the commotion at the gate had
subsided ajor and i arose to enter the hut and
at the same time a warrior appeared from one of
the twisted alleys which lying between the irregu-
larly placed huts and groups of huts form the
streets of the kro-lu village the fellow halted
before us and addressed me saying that al-tan de-
sired my presence at his hut the wording of the
invitation and the manner of the messenger threw
me entirely off my guard so cordial was the one
and respectful the other and the result was that
i went willingly telling ajor that i would return
presently i had laid my arms and ammunition
aside as soon as we had taken over the hut and i
left them with ajor now as i had noticed that aside
from their hunting-knives the men of kro-lu bore
no weapons about the village streets there was an
atmosphere of peace and security within that village
that i had not hoped to experience within caspak
and after what i had passed through it must have
cast a numbing spell over my faculties of judgment
and reason i had eaten of the lotus-flower of
safety dangers no longer threatened for they had
ceased to be

  the messenger led me through the labyrinthine
alleys to an open plaza near the center of the vil-
lage at one end of this plaza was a long hut
much the largest that i had yet seen before the
door of which were many warriors i could see
that the interior was lighted and that a great num-
ber of men were gathered within the dogs about
the plaza were as thick as fleas and those i ap-
proached closely evinced a strong desire to devour
me their noses evidently apprising them of the
fact that i was of an alien race since they paid no
attention whatever to my companion once inside
the council-hut for such it appeared to be i found
a large concourse of warriors seated or rather
squatted around the floor at one end of the oval
space which the warriors left down the center of
the room stood al-tan and another warrior whom i
immediately recognized as a galu and then i saw
that there were many galus present about the
walls were a number of flaming torches stuck in
holes in a clay plaster which evidently served the
purpose of preventing the inflammable wood and
grasses of which the hut was composed from being
ignited by the flames lying about among the war-
riors or wandering restlessly to and fro were a
number of savage dogs

  the warriors eyed me curiously as i entered
especially the galus and then i was conducted into
the center of the group and led forward toward
al-tan as i advanced i felt one of the dogs sniff-
ing at my heels and of a sudden a great brute
leaped upon my back as i turned to thrust it
aside before its fangs found a hold upon me i be-
held a huge airedale leaping frantically about me
the grinning jaws the half-closed eyes the back-
laid ears spoke to me louder than might the words
of man that here was no savage enemy but a joy-

ous friend and then i recognized him and fell to
one knee and put my arms about his neck while he
whined and cried with joy it was nobs dear old
nobs bowen tylers nobs who had loved me next
to his master

  where is the master of this dog i asked turn-
ing toward al-tan

  the chieftain inclined his head toward the galu
standing at his side he belongs to du-seen the
galu he replied

  he belongs to bowen j tyler jr of santa
monica i retorted and i want to know where his
master is

  the galu shrugged the dog is mine he said
he came to me cor-sva-jo and he is unlike any
dog in caspak being kind and docile and yet a killer
when aroused i would not part with him i do
not know the man of whom you speak

  so this was du-seen this was the man from
whom ajor had fled i wondered if he knew that
she was here i wondered if they had sent for me
because of her but after they had commenced to
question me my mind was relieved they did not
mention ajor their interest seemed centered upon
the strange world from which i had come my jour-
ney to caspak and my intentions now that i had
arrived i answered them frankly as i had nothing
to conceal and assured them that my only wish was
to find my friends and return to my own country
in the galu du-seen and his warriors i saw some-
thing of the explanation of the term golden race
which is applied to them for their ornaments and
weapons were either wholly of beaten gold or heav-
ily decorated with the precious metal they were
a very imposing set of men-tall and straight and
handsome about their heads were bands of gold
like that which ajor wore and from their left
shoulders depended the leopard-tails of the galus
in addition to the deer-skin tunic which constituted
the major portion of their apparel each carried a
light blanket of barbaric yet beautiful design-the
first evidence of weaving i had seen in caspak
ajor had had no blanket having lost it during her
flight from the attentions of du-seen nor was she
so heavily incrusted with gold as these male mem-
bers of her tribe

  the audience must have lasted fully an hour
when al-tan signified that i might return to my
hut all the time nobs had lain quietly at my feet
but the instant that i turned to leave he was up
and after me du-seen called to him but the ter-
rier never even so much as looked in his direction
i had almost reached the doorway leading from the
council-hall when al-tan rose and called after me
stop he shouted stop stranger the beast
of du-seen the galu follows you

  the dog is not du-seens i replied he be-
longs to my friends as i told you and he prefers to
stay with me until his master is found and i
turned again to resume my way i had taken but a
few steps when i heard a commotion behind me and
at the same moment a man leaned close and whis-
pered kazar close to my ear-kazar the cas-
pakian equivalent of beware it was to-mar as
he spoke he turned quickly away as though loath
to have others see that he knew me and at the
same instant i wheeled to discover du-seen striding


amazing stories

rapidly after me al-tan followed him and it was
evident that both were angry

  du-seen a weapon half drawn approached trucu-
lently the beast is mine he reiterated would
you steal him

  he is not yours nor mine i replied and i
am not stealing him if he wishes to follow you
he may i will not interfere but if he wishes to
follow me he shall nor shall you prevent i
turned to al-tan is not that fair i demanded
let the dog choose his master

nobs to the rescue

du-seen without waiting for al-tans reply
reached for nobs and grasped him by the
scruff of the neck i did not interfere for i
guessed what would happen and it did with a
savage growl nobs turned like lightning upon the
galu wrenched loose from his hold and leaped for
his throat the man stepped back and warded off
the first attack with a heavy blow of his fist imme-
diately drawing his knife with which to meet the
airedales return and nobs would have returned
all right had i not spoken to him in a low voice
i called him to heel for just an instant he hesi-
tated standing there trembling and with bared
fangs glaring at his foe but he was well trained
and had been out with me quite as much as he had
with bowen-in fact i had had most to do with
his early training then he walked slowly and very
stiff-legged to his place behind me

  du-seen red with rage would have had it out
with the two of us had not al-tan drawn him to one
side and whispered in his ear-upon which with a
grunt the galu walked straight back to the opposite
end of the hall while nobs and i continued upon
our way toward the hut and ajor as we passed
out into the village plaza i saw chal-az-we were
so close to one another that i could have reached
out and touched him-and our eyes met but though
i greeted him pleasantly and paused to speak to
him he brushed past me without a sign of recogni-
tion i was puzzled at his behavior and then i
recalled that to-mar though he had warned me
had appeared not to wish to seem friendly with me
i could not understand their attitude and was try-
ing to puzzle out some sort of explanation when
the matter was suddenly driven from my mind by
the report of a firearm instantly i broke into a
run my brain in a whirl of forebodings for the
culy firearms in the kro-lu country were those i
had left in the hut with ajor

  that she was in danger i could not but fear as
he was now something of an adept in the handling
of both the pistol and rifle a fact which largely
eliminated the chance that the shot had come from
an accidentally discharged firearm when i left
the hut i had felt that she and i were safe among
friends no thought of danger was in my mind but
since my audience with al-tan the presence and
bearing of du-seen and the strange attitude of both
to-mar and chal-az had each contributed toward
arousing my suspicions and now i ran along the
narrow winding alleys of the kro-lu village with
my heart fairly in my mouth

  i am endowed with an excellent sense of direction
which has been greatly perfected by the years i

have spent in the mountains and upon the plains
and deserts of my native state so that it was with
little or no difficulty that i found my way back to
the hut in which i had left ajor as i entered the
doorway i called her name aloud there was no
response i drew a box of matches from my pocket
and struck a light and as the flame flared up a
half-dozen brawny warriors leaped upon me from
as many directions but even in the brief instant
that the flare lasted i saw that ajor was not within
the hut and that my arms and ammunition had
been removed

  as the six men leaped upon me an angry growl
burst from behind them i had forgotten nobs
like a demon of hate he sprang among those kro-lu
fighting men tearing rending ripping with his
long tusks and his mighty jaws they had me
down in an instant and it goes without saying that
the six of them could have kept me there had it not
been for nobs but while i was struggling to throw
them off nobs was springing first upon one and
then upon another of them until they were so put
to it to preserve their hides and their lives from
him that they could give me only a small part of
their attention one of them was assiduously at-
tempting to strike me on the head with his stone
hatchet but i caught his arm and at the same
time turned over upon my belly after which it took
but an instant to get my feet under me and rise
suddenly

  as i did so i kept a grip upon the mans arm
carrying it over one shoulder then i leaned sud-
denly forward and hurled my antagonist over my
head to a nasty fall at the opposite side of the hut
in the dim light of the interior i saw that nobs
had already accounted for one of the others-one
who lay very quiet upon the floor-while the four
remaining upon their feet were striking at him with
knives and hatchets

  running to the side of the man i had just put
out of the fighting i seized his hatchet and knife
and in another moment was in the thick of the
argument i was no match for these savage war-
riors with their own weapons and would soon have
gone down to ignominious defeat and death had
it not been for nobs who alone was a match for
the four of them i never saw any creature so quick
upon its feet as was that great airedale nor such
frightful ferocity as he manifested in his attacks
it was as much the latter as the former which con-
tributed to the undoing of our enemies who accus-
tomed though they were to the ferocity of terrible
creatures seemed awed by the sight of this strange
beast from another world battling at the side of
his equally strange master yet they were no
cowards and only by teamwork did nobs and i
overcome them at last we would rush for a man
simultaneously and as nobs leaped for him upon
one side i would strike at his head with the stone
hatchet from the other

  as the last man went down i heard the running
of many feet approaching us from the direction of
the plaza to be captured now would mean death
yet i could not attempt to leave the village without
first ascertaining the whereabouts of ajor and re-
leasing her if she were held a captive that i could
escape the village i was not at all sure but of one
the land that time forgot



thing i was positive that it would do neither ajor
nor myself any service to remain where i was and
be captured so with nobs bloody and happy fol-
lowing at heel i turned down the first alley and
slunk away in the direction of the northern end of
the village

  friendless and alone hunted through the dark
labyrinths of this savage community i seldom have
felt more helpless than at that moment yet far
transcending any fear which i may have felt for
my own safety was my concern for that of ajor
what fate had befallen her where was she and
in whose power that i should live to learn the
answers to these queries i doubted but that i
should face death gladly in the attempt-of that
i was certain and why with all my concern for
the welfare of my friends who had accompanied me
to caprona and of my best friend of all bowen j
tyler jr i never yet had experienced the almost
paralyzing fear for the safety of any other crea-
ture which now threw me alternately into a fever
of despair and into a cold sweat of apprehension
as my mind dwelt upon the fate of one bit of half-
savage femininity of whose very existence i had
not even dreamed a few short weeks before

  what was this hold she had upon me was i
bewitched that my mind refused to function
sanely and that judgment and reason were de-
throned by some mad sentiment which i steadfastly
refused to believe was love i had never been in
love i was not in love now-the very thought was
preposterous how could i thomas billings the
right-hand man of the late bowen j tyler sr one
of americas foremost captains of industry and the
greatest man in california be in love with a-a-
the word stuck in my throat yet by my own amer-
ican standards ajor could be nothing else at home
for all her beauty for all her delicately tinted skin
little ajor by her apparel by the habits and cus-
toms and manners of her people by her life would
have been classed as a squaw tom billings in love
with a squaw i shuddered at the thought

  and then there came to my mind in a sudden
brilliant flash upon the screen of recollection the
picture of ajor as i had last seen her and i lived
again the delicious moment in which we had clung
to one another lips smothering lips as i left her
to go to the council hall of al-tan and i could have
kicked myself for the snob and the cad that my
thoughts had proven me-me who had always
prided myself that i was neither the one nor the
other

  these things ran through my mind as nobs and i
made our way through the dark village the voices
and footsteps of those who sought us still in our
ears these and many other things i could not
escape the incontrovertible fact that the little fig-
ure round which my recollections and my hopes
entwined themselves was that of ajor-beloved
barbarian my reveries were broken in upon by a
hoarse whisper from the black interior of a hut past
which we were making our way my name was
called in a low voice and a man stepped out beside
me as i halted with raised knife it was chal-az

  quick he warned in here it is my hut
and they will not search it

  i hesitated recalling his attitude of a few min-

utes before and as though he had read my
thoughts he said quickly i could not speak to
you in the plaza without danger of arousing sus-
picions which would prevent me aiding you later
for word had gone out that al-tan had turned
against you and would destroy you-this was after
du-seen the galu arrived

ajor the beautiful caspakian safe

i followed him into the hut and with nobs
at our heels we passed through several chambers
into a remote and windowless apartment where a
small lamp sputtered in its unequal battle with the
inky darkness a hole in the roof permitted the
smoke from the burning oil egress yet the atmos-
phere was far from lucid here chal-az motioned
me to a seat upon a furry hide spread upon the
earthen floor

  i am your friend he said you saved my
life and i am no ingrate as is the batu al-tan i
will serve you and there are others here who will
serve you against al-tan and this renegade galu
du-seen

  but where is ajor i asked for i cared little
for my own safety while she was in danger

  ajor is safe too he answered we learned
the designs of al-tan and du-seen the latter
learning that ajor was here demanded her and
al-tan promised that he should have her but when
the warriors went to get her to-mar went with
them ajor tried to defend herself she killed
one of the warriors and then to-mar picked her up
in his arms when the others had taken her weapons
from her he told the others to look after the
wounded man who was really already dead and to
seize you upon your return and that he to-mar
would bear ajor to al-tan but instead of bearing
her to al-tan he took her to his own hut where
she now is with so-al to-mars she it all hap-
pened very quickly to-mar and i were in the
council-hut when du-seen attempted to take the dog
from you i was seeking to-mar for this work
he ran out immediately and accompanied the war-
riors to your hut while i remained to watch what
went on within the council-hut and to aid you if you
needed aid what has happened since you know

  i thanked him for his loyalty and then asked
him to take me to ajor but he said that it could
not be done as the village streets were filled with
searchers in fact we could hear them passing to
and fro among the huts making inquiries and at
last chal-az thought it best to go to the doorway
of his dwelling which consisted of many huts joined
together lest they enter and search

  chal-az was absent for a long time-several
hours which seemed an eternity to me all sounds
of pursuit had long since ceased and i was becom-
ing uneasy because of his protracted absence when
i heard him returning through the other apartments
of his dwelling he was perturbed when he entered
that in which i awaited him and i saw a worried
expression upon his face

  what is wrong i asked have they found
ajor

  no he replied but ajor has gone she
learned that you had escaped them and was told
that you had left the village believing that she had
escaped too so-al could not detain her she made


amazing stories

her way out over the top of the palisade armed
only with her knife

  then i must go i said rising nobs rose and
shook himself he had been dead alseep when i
spoke

  yes agreed chal-az you must go at once it
is almost dawn du-seen leaves at daylight to
search for her he leaned close to my ear and
whispered there are many to follow and help
you al-tan has agreed to aid du-seen against the
galus of jor but there are many of us who have
combined to rise against al-tan and prevent this
ruthless desecration of the laws and customs of the
kro-lu and of caspak we will rise as luata has
ordained that we shall rise and only thus no batu
may win the estate of a galu by treachery and force
of arms while chal-az lives and can wield a heavy
bow and a sharp spear with true kro-lus at his
back

  i hope that i may live to aid you i replied if
i had my weapons and my ammunition i could do
much do you know where they are

  no he said they have disappeared and
then wait you cannot go forth half armed
and garbed as you are you are going into the
galu country and you must go as a galu come
and without waiting for a reply he led me into
another apartment or to be more explicit another
of the several huts which formed his cellular
dwelling

  here was a pile of skins weapons and ornaments
remove your strange apparel said chal-az and
i will fit you out as a true galu i have slain sev-
eral of them in the raids of my early days as a
kro-lu and here are their trappings

dressing and arming in caspakian style

i saw the wisdom of his suggestion and as my
clothes were by now so ragged as to but half
conceal my nakedness i had no regrets in laying
them aside stripped to the skin i donned the red-
deer-skin tunic the leopard-tail the golden fillet
armlets and ieg-ornaments of a galu with the belt
scabbard and knife the shield spear bow and
arrow and the long rope which i learned now for
the first time is the distinctive weapon of the galu
warrior it is a rawhide rope not dissimilar to
those of the western plains and cow-camps of my
youth the honda is a golden oval about which is
braided the rawhide making a heavy and accurate
weight for the throwing of the noose this heavy
honda chal-az explained is used as a weapon be-
ing thrown with great force and accuracy at an
enemy and then coiled in for another cast in hunt-
ing and in battle they use both the noose and the
honda if several warriors surround a single foe-
man or quarry they rope it with the noose from
several sides but a single warrior against a lone
antagonist will attempt to brain his foe with the
metal oval

  i could not have been more pleased with any
weapon short of a rifle which he could have found
for me since i have been adept with the rope from
early childhood but i must confess that i was less
favorably inclined toward my apparel in so far
as the sensation was concerned i might as well have
been entirely naked so short and light was the

tunic when i asked chal-az for the caspakian
name for rope he told me ga and for the first time
i understood the derivation of the word galu which
means ropeman

  entirely outfitted i would not have known my-
self so strange was my garb and my armament
upon my back were slung my bow arrows shield
and short spear from the center of my girdle de-
pended my knife at my right hip was my stone
hatchet and at my left hung the coils of my long
rope by reaching my right hand over my left
shoulder i could seize the spear or arrows my
left hand could find my bow over my right shoulder
while a veritable contortionist-act was necessary to
place my shield in front of me and upon my left
arm the shield long and oval is utilized more as
back-armor than as a defense against frontal at-
tack for the close-set armlets of gold upon the
left fore-arm are principally depended upon to ward
off knife spear hatchet or arrow from in front
but against the greater carnivora and the attacks
of several human antagonists the shield is utilized
to its best advantage and carried by loops upon the
left arm

  fully equipped except for a blanket i followed
chal-az from his domicile into the dark and de-
serted alleys of kro-lu silently we crept along
nobs silent at heel toward the nearest portion of
the palisade here chal-az bade me farewell tell-
ing me that he hoped to see me soon among the
galus as he felt that the call soon would come
to him i thanked him for his loyal assistance and
promised that whether i reached the galu country
or not i should always stand ready to repay his
kindness to me and that he could count on me in
the revolution against al-tan

chapter vii

to run up the inclined surface of the pali-
sade and drop to the ground outside was the
work of but a moment or would have been
but for nobs i had to put my rope about him
after we reached the top lift him over the sharp-
ened stakes and lower him upon the outside to
find ajor in the unknown country to the north
seemed rather hopeless yet i could do no less than
try praying in the meanwhile that she would come
through unscathed and in safety to her father

  as nobs and i swung along in the growing light
of the coming day i was impressed by the lessen-
ing numbers of savage beasts the farther north i
traveled with the decrease among the carnivora
the herbivora increased in quantity though any-
where in caspak they are sufficiently plentiful to
furnish ample food for the meat-eaters of each
locality the wild cattle antelope deer and horses
i passed showed changes in evolution from their
cousins farther south the kine were smaller and
less shaggy the horses larger north of the kro-lu
village i saw a small band of the latter of about
the size of those of our old western plains-such
as the indians bred in former days and to a lesser
extent even now they were fat and sleek and i
looked upon them with covetous eyes and with
thoughts that any old cow-puncher may well imag-
ine i might entertain after having hoofed it for
weeks but they were wary scarce permitting me
the land that time forgot



to approach within bow-and-arrow range much less
within roping-distance yet i still had hopes which
i never discarded

  twice before noon we were stalked and charged
by man-eaters but even though i was without fire-
arms i still had ample protection in nobs who
evidently had learned something of caspakian hunt
rules under the tutorage of du-seen or some other
galu and of course a great deal more by experi-
ence he always was on the alert for dangerous
foes invariably warning me by low growls of the
approach of a large carnivorous animal long before
i could either see or hear it and then when the
thing appeared he would run snapping at his heels
drawing the charge away from me until i found
safety in some tree yet never did the wily nobs
take an unnecessary chance of mauling he would
dart in and away so quickly that not even the light-
ning-like movements of the great cats could reach
him i have seen him tantalize them thus until
they fairly screamed in rage

  the greatest inconvenience the man-eaters caused
was the delay for they have a nasty habit of
keeping one treed for an hour or more if balked in
their designs but at last we came in sight of a
line of cliffs running east and west across our path
as far as the eye could see in either direction
and i knew that we had reached the natural
boundary which marks the line between the kro-lu
and galu countries the southern face of these cliffs
loomed high and forbidding rising to an altitude of
some two hundred feet sheer and precipitous with-
out a break that the eye could perceive how i
was to find a crossing i could not guess whether
to search to the east toward the still loftier barrier-
cliffs fronting upon the ocean or westward in the
direction of the inland sea was a question which
baffled me were there many passes or only one
i had no way of knowing i could but trust to
chance it never occurred to me that nobs had
made the crossing at least once possibly a greater
number of times and that he might lead me to
the pass and so it was with no idea of assistance
that i appealed to him as a man alone with a dumb
brute so often does

  nobs i said how the devil are we going to
cross those cliffs

  i do not say that he understood me even though
i realize that an airedale is a mighty intelligent
dog but i do swear that he seemed to understand
me for he wheeled about barking joyously and
trotted off toward the west and when i didnt fol-
low him he ran back to me barking furiously and
at last taking hold of the calf of my leg in an effort
to pull me along in the direction he wished me to
go now as my legs were naked and nobs jaws
are much more powerful than he realizes i gave
in and followed him for i knew that i might as
well go west as east as far as any knowledge i had
of the correct direction went

  we followed the base of the cliffs for a consider-
able distance the ground was rolling and tree-
dotted and covered with grazing animals alone in
pairs and in herds-a motley aggregation of the
modern and extinct herbivora of the world a
huge woolly mastodon stood swaying to and fro in
the shade of a giant fern-a mighty bull with enor-

mous upcurving tusks near him grazed an
aurochs bull with a cow and calf close beside a lone
rhinoceros asleep in a dust-hole deer antelope
bison horses sheep and goats were all in sight
at the same time and at a little distance a giant
megatherium reared up on its huge tail and massive
hind feet to tear the leaves from a tall tree the
forgotten past rubbed flanks with the present-
while tom billings modern of the moderns passed
in the garb of a pre-glacial man and before him
trotted a creature of a breed scarce sixty years
old nobs was a parvenu but it failed to worry
him

  as we neared the inland sea we saw more flying
reptiles and several great amphibians but none of
them attacked us in the middle of the afternoon
as we were topping a rise i saw something that
brought me to a sudden stop calling nobs in a
whisper i cautioned him to silence and kept him
at heel while i threw myself flat and watched from
behind a sheltering shrub a body of warriors ap-
proaching the cliff from the south i could see
that they were galus and i guessed that du-seen
led them they had taken a shorter route to the
pass and so had overhauled me i could see them
plainly for they were no great distance away and
i saw with relief that ajor was not with them

  the cliffs before them were broken and ragged
those coming from the east overlapping the cliffs
from the west into the defile formed by this over-
lapping the party filed i could see them climbing
upward for a few minutes and then they disap-
peared from view when the last of them had
passed from sight i rose and bent my steps in the
direction of the pass-the same pass toward which
nobs had evidently been leading me i went warily
as i approached it for fear the party might have
halted to rest if they hadnt halted i had no
fear of being discovered for i had seen that the
galus marched without point flankers or rear
guard and when i reached the pass and saw a
narrow one-man trail leading upward at a stiff
angle i wished that i were chief of the galus for
a few weeks a dozen men could hold off forever
in that narrow pass all the hordes which might be
brought up from the south yet there it lay entirely
unguarded

  the galus might be a great people in caspak
but they were pitifully inefficient in even the sim-
pler forms of military tactics i was surprised that
even a man of the stone age should be so lacking
in military perspicacity du-seen dropped far be-
low par in my estimation as i saw the slovenly
formation of his troop as it passed through an
enemy country and entered the domain of the chief
against whom he had risen in revolt but du-seen
must have known jor the chief and known that jor
would not be waiting for him at the pass never-
theless he took unwarranted chances with one
squad of home-guard company i could have con-
quered caspak

  nobs and i followed to the summit of the pass
and there we saw the party defiling into the galu
country the level of which was not on an average
over fifty feet below the summit of the cliffs and
about a hundred and fifty feet above the adjacent
kro-lu domain immediately the landscape changed


amazing stories

the trees the flowers and the shrubs were of a
hardier type and i realized that at night the galu
blanket might be almost a necessity acacia anf
eucalyptus predominated among the trees yet there
were ash and oak and even pine and fir and hem-
lock the tree-life was riotous the forests were
dense and filled with enormous trees from the
summit of the cliff i could see forests rising hun-
dreds of feet above the level upon which i stood
and even at the distance they were from me i real-
ized that the boles were of gigantic size

a good bow-shot

at last i had come to the galu country though
not conceived in caspak i had indeed come up
eor-sva-jo-from the beginning i had come up
through the hideous horrors of the lower caspakian
spheres of evolution and i could not but feel some-
thing of the elation and pride which had filled
to-mar and so-al when they realized that the call
had come to them and they were about to rise from
the estate of band-lus to that of kro-lus i was
glad that i was not batu

  but where was ajor though my eyes searched
the wide landscape before me i saw nothing other
than warriors of du-seen and the beasts of the
fields and the forests surrounded by forests i
could see wide plains dotting the country as far as
the eye could reach but nowhere was a sign of a
small galu she-the beloved she whom i would have
given my right hand to see

  nobs and i were hungry we had not eaten since
the preceding night and below us was game-deer
sheep anything that a hungry hunter might crave
so down the steep trail we made our way and then
upon my belly with nobs crouching low behind
me i crawled toward a small herd of red deer feed-
ing at the edge of a plain close beside a forest
there was ample cover what with solitary trees
and dotting bushes so that i found no difficulty in
stalking up wind to within fifty feet of my quarry-
a large sleek doe unaccompanied by a fawn
greatly then did i regret my rifle never in my
life had i shot an arrow but i knew how it was
done and fitting the shaft to my string i aimed
carefully and let drive at the same instant i
called to nobs and leaped to my feet

  the arrow caught the doe full in the side and
in the same moment nobs was after her she
turned to flee with the two of us pursuing her nobs
with his great fangs bared and i with my short
spear poised for a cast the balance bi the herd
sprang quickly away but the hurt doe lagged and
in a moment nobs was beside her and had leaped
at her throat he had her down when i came up
and i finished her with my spear it didnt take
me long to have a fire going and a steak broiling
and while i was preparing for my own feast nobs
was filling himself with raw venison never have
i enjoyed a meal so heartily

  for two days i searched fruitlessly back and
forth from the inland sea almost to the barrier
cliffs for some trace of ajor and always i trended
northward but i saw no sign of any human be-
ing not even the band of galu warriors under du-
seen and then i commenced to have misgivings
had chal-az spoken the truth to me when he said

that ajor had quit the village of the kro-lu
might he not have been acting upon the orders of
al-tan in whose savage bosom might have lurked
some small spark of shame that he had attempted
to do to death one who had befriended a kro-lu
warrior-a guest who had brought no harm upon
the kro-lu race-and thus have sent me out upon
a fruitless mission in the hope that the wild beasts
would do what al-tan hesitated to do i did not
know but the more i thought upon it the more
convinced i became that ajor had not quitted the
kro-lu village but if not what had brought du-
seen forth without her there was a puzzler and
once again i was all at sea

  on the second day of my experiences of the galu
country i came upon a bunch of as magnificent
horses as it has ever been my lot to see they were
dark bays with blazed faces and perfect surcingles
of white about their barrels their forelegs were
white to the knees in height they stood almost
sixteen hands the mares being a trifle smaller than
the stallions of which there were three or four
in this band of a hundred which comprised many
colts and half-grown horses their markings were
almost identical indicating a purity of strain that
might have persisted since long ages ago if i had
coveted one of the little ponies of the kro-lu coun-
try imagine my state of mind when i came upon
these magnificent creatures no sooner had i
espied them than i determined to possess one of
them nor did it take me long to select a beautiful
young stallion-a four-year-old i guessed him

the lasso and the horses

the horses were grazing close to the edge of
the forest in which nobs and i were concealed
while the ground between us and them was dotted
with clumps of flowering brush which offered per-
fect concealment the stallion of my choice grazed
with a filly and two yearlings a little apart from
the balance of the herd and nearest to the forest
and to me at my whispered charge nobs flat-
tened himself to the ground and i knew that he
would not again move until i called him unless
danger threatened me from the rear carefully i
crept forward toward my unsuspecting quarry
coming undetected to the concealment of a bush not
more than twenty feet from him here i quietly
arranged my noose spreading it flat and open upon
the ground

  to step to one side of the bush and throw di-
rectly from the ground which is the style i am best
in would take but an instant and in that instant
the stallion would doubtless be under way at top
speed in the opposite direction yet i felt that i
could accomplish it and especially so if the animal
would but turn for a moment in my direction
then he would have to wheel about when i sur-
prised him and in doing so he would most certainly
rise sliglitly upon his hind feet and throw up his
head presenting a perfect target for my noose as
he pivoted

  yes i had it beautifully worked out and i
waited until he should turn in my direction at
last it became evident that he was doing so when
apparently without cause the filly raised her head
neighed and started off at a trot in the opposite
the land that time forgot



direction immediately followed of course by the
colts and my stallion it looked for a moment as
though my last hope was blasted but presently
their fright if fright it was passed and they re-
sumed grazing again a hundred yards farther on
this time there was no bush within fifty feet of
them and i was at a loss as to how to get within
safe roping-distance anywhere under forty feet
i am an excellent roper at fifty feet i am fair but
over that i knew it would be but a matter of luck
if i succeeded in getting my noose about that beau-
tiful arched neck

  as i stood debating the question in my mind i
was almost upon the point of making the attempt
at the long throw i had plenty of rope this galu
weapon being fully sixty feet long how i wished
for the collies from the ranch at a word they
would have circled this little bunch and driven it
straight down to me and then it flashed into my
mind that nobs had run with those collies all one
summer that he had gone down to the pasture with
them after the cows every evening and done his
part in driving them back to the milking-barn and
had done it intelligently but nobs had never done
the thing alone and it had been a year since he
had done it at all however the chances were
more in favor of my foozling the long throw than
that nobs would fall down in his part if i gave
him the chance

  having come to a decision i had to creep back
to nobs and get him and then with him at my heels
return to a large bush near the four horses here
we could see directly through the bush and point-
ing the animals out to nobs i whispered fetch
em boy

  in an instant he was gone circling wide toward
the rear of the quarry they caught sight of him
almost immediately and broke into a trot away from
him but when they saw that he was apparently-
giving them a wide berth they stopped again
though they stood watching him with high-held
heads and quivering nostrils it was a beautiful
sight and then nobs turned in behind them and
trotted slowly back toward me he did not bark
or come rushing down upon them and then when he
had come closer to them he proceeded at a walk
the splendid creatures seemed more curious than
fearful making no effort to escape until nobs was
quite close to them then they trotted slowly away
at right angles

nobs driving the horses to capture

and now the fun and trouble commenced nobs
of course attempted to turn them and he
seemed to have selected the stallion to work upon
for he paid no attention to the others having in-
telligence enough to know that a lone dog could run
his legs off before he could round up four horses
that didnt wish to be rounded up the stallion
however had notions of his own about being
headed and the result was as pretty a race as one
would care to see gad how that horse could run
he seemed to flatten out and shoot through the air
with the very minimum of exertion and at his fore-
foot ran nobs doing his best to turn him he was
barking now and twice he leaped high against the
stallfons flank but this cost too much effort and

always lost him ground as each time he was hurled
heels over head by the impact yet before they dis-
appeared over a rise in the ground i was sure that
nobs persistence was bearing fruit it seemed to
me that the horse was giving way a trifle to the
right nobs was between him and the main herd
to which the yearling and filly had already fled

  as i stood waiting for nobs return i could
not but speculate upon my chances should i be at-
tacked by some formidable beast i was some dis-
tance from the forest and armed with weapons in
the use of which i was quite untrained though i
had practiced some with the spear since leaving
the kro-lu country i must admit that my thoughts
were not pleasant ones verging almost upon cow-
ardice until i chanced to think of little ajor alone
in this same land and armed only with a knife i
was immediately filled with shame but in thinking
the matter over since i have come to the conclu-
sion that my state of mind was influenced largely
by my approximate nakedness if you have never
wandered about in broad daylight garbed in a bit
of red-deer skin of inadequate length you can have
no conception of the sensation of futility that over-
whelms one clothes to a man accustomed to
wearing clothes impart a certain self-confidence
lack of them induces panic

  but no beast attacked me though i saw several
menacing forms passing through the dark aisles
of the forest at last i commenced to worry over
nobs protracted absence and to fear that some-
thing had befallen him i was coiling my rope
to start out in search of him when i saw the
stallion leap into view at almost the same spot be-
hind which he had disappeared and at his heels
ran nobs neither was running so fast or furiously
as when last i had seen them

  the horse as he approached me i could see was
laboring hard yet he kept gamely to his task and
nobs too the splendid fellow was driving the
quarry straight toward me i crouched behind my
bush and laid my noose in readiness to throw as
the two approached my hiding-place nobs reduced
his speed and the stallion evidently only too glad
of the respite dropped into a trot it was at this
gait that he passed me my rope-hand flew forward
the honda well down held the noose open and the
beautiful bay fairly ran his head into it

  instantly he wheeled to dash off at right angles
i braced myself with the rope around my hip and
brought him to a sudden stand rearing and strug-
gling he fought for his liberty while nobs pant-
ing and with lolling tongue came and threw him-
self down near me he seemed to know that his
work was done and that he had earned his rest
the stallion was pretty well spent and after a few
minutes of struggling he stood with feet far spread
nostrils dilated and eyes wide watching me as i
edged slowly toward him taking in the slack of
the rope as i advanced a dozen times he reared
and tried to break away but always i spoke sooth-
ingly to him and after an hour of effort i suc-
ceeded in reaching his head and stroking his
muzzle then i gathered a handful of grass and
offered it to him and always i talked to him in a
quiet and reassuring voice

  i had expected a battle royal but on the con-


amazing stories

trary i found his taming a matter of comparative
ease though wild he was gentle to a degree and
of such remarkable intelligence that he soon dis-
covered that i had no intention of harming him
after that all was easy before that day was done
i had taught him to lead and to stand while i
stroked his head and flanks and to eat from my
hand and had the satisfaction of seeing the light
of fear die in his large intelligent eyes

  the following day i fashioned a hackamore from
a piece which i cut from the end of my long galu
rope and then i mounted him fully prepared for a
struggle of titanic proportions in which i was none
too sure that he would not come off victor but he
never made the slightest effort to unseat me and
from then on his education was rapid no horse
ever learned more quickly the meaning of the rein
and the pressure of the knees i think he soon
learned to love me and i know that i loved him
while he and nobs were the best of pals i called
him ace i had a friend who was once in the french
flying-corps and when ace let himself out he cer-
tainly flew

  i cannot explain to you nor can you understand
unless you too are a horseman the exhilarating
feeling of well-being which pervaded me from the
moment that i commenced riding ace i was a new
man imbued with a sense of superiority that led
me to feel that i could go forth and conquer all
caspak single-handed now when i needed meat
i ran it down on ace and roped it and when some
great beast with which we could not cope threatened
us we galloped away to safety but for the most
part the creatures we met looked upon us in terror
for ace and i in combination presented a new and
unusual beast beyond their experience and ken

  for five days i rode back and forth across the
southern end of the galu country without seeing
a human being yet all the time i was working
slowly toward the north for i had determined to
comb the territory thoroughly in search of ajor
but on the fifth day as i emerged from a forest i
saw some distance ahead of me a single small figure
pursued by many others instantly i recognized
the quarry as ajor the entire party was fully a
mile away from me and they were crossing my
path at right angles ajor a few hundred yards in
advance of those who followed her one of her
pursuers was far in advance of the others and was
gaining upon her rapidly with a word and a pres-
sure of the knees i sent ace leaping out into the
open and with nobs running close alongside we
raced toward her

  at first none of them saw us but as we neared
ajor the pack behind the foremost pursuer discov-
ered us and set up such a howl as i never before
have heard they were all galus and i soon rec-
ognized the foremost as du-seen he was almost
upon ajor now and with a sense of terror such as
i had never before experienced i saw that he ran
with his knife in his hand and that his intention
was to slay rather than capture i could not under-
stand it but i could only urge ace to greater speed
and most nobly did the wondrous creature respond
to my demands if ever a four-footed creature ap-
proximated flying it was ace that day

a rescue in the quagmire

du-seen intent upon his brutal design had as
yet not noticed us he was within a pace of
ajor when ace and i dashed between them and i
leaning down to the left swept my little barbarian
into the hollow of an arm and up to the withers of
my glorious ace we had snatched her from the
very clutches of du-seen who halted mystified and
raging ajor too was mystified as we had come
up from diagonally behind her so that she had no
idea that we were near until she was swung to aces
back the little savage turned with drawn knife
to stab me thinking that i was some new enemy
when her eyes found my face and she recognized
me with a little sob she threw her arms about
my neck gasping my tom my tom

  and then ace sank suddenly into thick mud to his
belly and ajor and i were thrown far over his
head he had run into one of those numerous
springs which cover caspak sometimes they are
little lakes again but tiny pools and often mere
quagmires of mud as was this one overgrown with
lush grasses which effectually hid its treacherous
identity it is a wonder that ace did not break a
leg so fast he was going when he fell but he
didnt though with four good legs he was unable
to wallow from the mire ajor and i had sprawled
face down into the covering grasses and so had
not sunk deeply but when we tried to rise we
found that there was no footing and presently we
saw that du-seen and his followers were coming
down upon us there was no escape it was evi-
dent that we were doomed

  slay me begged ajor let me die at thy
loved hands rather than beneath the knife of this
hateful thing for he will kill me he has sworn
to kill me last night he captured me and when
later he would have had his way with me i struck
him with my fists and with my knife i stabbed him
and then i escaped leaving him raging in pain and
thwarted desire to-day they searched for me and
found me and as i fled du-seen ran after me cry-
ing that he would slay me kill me my tom and
then fall upon thine own spear for they will kill
you horribly if they take you alive

  i couldnt kill her-not at least until the last
moment and i told her so and that i loved her
and that until death came i would live and fight
for her

  nobs had followed us into the bog and had done
fairly well at first but when he neared us he too
sank to his belly and could only flounder about we
were in this predicament when du-seen and his fol-
lowers approached the edge of the horrible swamp
i saw that al-tan was with him and many other
kro-lu warriors the alliance against jor the chief
had therefore been consummated and this horde
was already marching upon the galu city i sighed
as i thought how close i had been to saving not
only ajor but her father and his people from de-
feat and death

  beyond the swamp was a dense wood could we
have reached this we would have been safe but it
might as well have been a hundred miles away as a
hundred yards across that hidden lake of sticky
mud upon the edge of the swamp du-seen and his
the land that time forgot



horde halted to revile us they could not reach us
with their hands but at a command from du-seen
they fitted arrows to their bows and i saw that
the end had come ajor huddled close to me and
i took her in my arms i love you tom she
said only you tears came to my eyes then not
tears of self-pity for my predicament but tears
from a heart filled with a great love-a heart that
sees the sun of its life and its love setting even as
it rises

  the renegade galus and their kro-lu allies stood
waiting for the word from du-seen that would
launch that barbed avalanche of death upon us
when there broke from the wood beyond the swamp
the sweetest music that ever fell upon the ears of
man-the sharp staccato of at least two score rifles
fired rapidly at will down went the galu and
kro-lu warriors like tenpins before that deadly
fusillade

  what could it mean to me it meant but one
thing and that was that hollis and short and the
others had scaled the cliffs and made their way north
to the galu country upon the opposite side of the
island in time to save ajor and me from almost
certain death i didnt have to have an introduc-
tion to them to know that the men who held those
rifles were the men of my own party and when
a few minutes later they came forth from their
concealment my eyes verified my hopes there
they were every man-jack of them and with them
were a thousand straight sleek warriors of the
galu race and ahead of the others came two men
in the garb of galus each was tall and straight
and wonderfully muscled yet they differed as ace
might differ from a perfect specimen of another
species as they approached the mire ajor held
forth her arms and cried jor my chief my
father and the elder of the two rushed in knee-
deep to rescue her and then the other came closer
and looked into my face and his eyes went wide
and mine too and i cried bowen for heavens
sake bowen tyler

the lost is found climbing the cliffs

it was he my search was ended around me
were all my company and the man we had
searched a new world to find they cut saplings
from the forest and laid a road into the swamp be-
fore they could get us all out and then we marched
back to the city of jor the galu chief and there
was great rejoicing when ajor came home again
mounted upon the glossy back of the stallion ace

  tyler and hollis and short and all the rest of
us americans nearly worked our jaws loose on the
march back to the village and for days afterward
we kept it up they told me how they had crossed
the barrier cliffs in five days working twenty-four
hours a day in three eight-hour shifts with two re-
liefs to each shift alternating half-hourly two
men with electric drills driven from the dynamos
aboard the toreador drilled two holes four feet
apart in the face of the cliff and in the same hori-
zontal plane the holes slanted slightly downward
into these holes the iron rods brought as a part of
our equipment and for just this purpose were in-
serted extending about a foot beyond the face of
the rock across these two rods a plank was laid and

then the next shift mounting to the new level
bored two more holes five feet above the new plat-
form and so on

  during the nights the searchlights from the
toreador were kept playing upon the cliff at the
point where the drills were working and at the
rate of ten feet an hour the summit was reached
upon the fifth day ropes were lowered blocks
lashed to trees at the top and crude elevators
rigged so that by the night of the fifth day the
entire party with the exception of the few men
needed to man the toreador were within caspak
with an abundance of arms ammunition and
equipment

  from then on they fought their way north in
search of me after a vain and perilous effort to
enter the hideous reptile-infested country to the
south owing to the number of guns among them
they had not lost a man but their path was strewrn
with the dead creatures they had been forced to
slay to win their way to the north end of the
island where they had found bowen and his bride
among the galus of jor

  the reunion between bowen and nobs was
marked by a frantic display upon nobs part
which almost stripped bowen of the scanty attire
that the galu custom had vouchsafed him when
we arrived at the galu city lys la rue was wait-
ing to welcome us she was mrs tyler now as
the master of the toreador had married them the
very day that the search-party had found them
though neither lys nor bowen would admit that
any civil or religious ceremony could have rendered
more sacred the bonds with which god had united
them

  neither bowen nor the party from the toreador
had seen any sign of bradley and his party they
had been so long lost now that any hopes for them
must be definitely abandoned the galus had heard
rumors of them as had the western kro-lu and
band-lu but none had seen aught of them since
they had left fort dinosaur months since

  we rested in jors village for a fortnight while
we prepared for the southward journey to the point
where the toreador was to lie offshore in wait for
us during these two weeks chal-az came up from
the kro-lu country now a full-fledged galu he
told us that the remnants of al-tans party had been
slain when they attempted to reenter kro-lu
chal-az had been made chief and when he rose
had left the tribe under a new leader whom all
respected

  nobs stuck close to bowen but ace and ajor
and i went out upon many long rides through the
beautiful north galu country chal-az had brought
my arms and ammunition up from kro-lu with him
but my clothes were gone nor did i miss them
once i became accustomed to the free attire of the
galu

  at last came the time for our departure upon
the following morning we were to set out toward
the south and the toreador and dear old california

i	had asked ajor to go with us but jor her father
had refused to listen to the suggestion no pleas
could swerve him from his decision ajor the
cos-ata-lo from whom might spring a new and
greater caspakian race could not be spared i


amazing stories

might have any other she among the galus but
ajor-no

  the poor child was heartbroken and as for me

i	was slowly realizing the hold that ajor had upon
my heart and wondering how i should get along
without her as i held her in my arms that last
night i tried to imagine what life would be without
her for at last there had come to me the realiza-
tion that i loved her-loved my little barbarian
and as i finally tore myself away and went to my
own hut to snatch a few hours sleep before we set
off upon our long journey on the morrow i con-
soled myself with the thought that time would heal
the wound and that back in my native land i should
find a mate who would be all and more to me than
little ajor could ever be-a woman of my own race
and my own culture

  morning came more quickly than i could have
wished i rose and breakfasted but saw nothing
of ajor it was best i thought that i go thus
without the harrowing pangs of a last farewell
the party formed for the march an escort of galu
warriors ready to accompany us i could not even
bear to go to aces corral and bid him farewell
the night before i had given him to ajor and

to be

  now in my mind the two seemed quite inseparable

    and so we marched away down along the street
  flanked with its stone houses and out through the
  wide gateway in the stone wall which surrounds
  the city and on across the clearing toward the forest
  through which we must pass to reach the northern
  boundary of galu beyond which we would turn
  south at the edge of the forest i cast a last back-
  ward glance at the city which held my heart and
  beside the massive gateway i saw that which
  brought me to a sudden halt it was a little figure
  leaning against one of the great upright posts upon
  which the gates swing-a crumpled little figure
  and even at this distance i could see its shoulders
  heave to the sobs that racked it it was the last
  straw

    bowen was near me good-bye old man i
  said im going back

    he looked at me in surprise good-bye old
  man he said and grasped my hand i thought
  youd do it in the end

    and then i went back and took ajor in my arms
and kissed the tears from her eyes and a smile to
her lips while together we watched the last of the
americans disappear into the forest

in this department we shall discuss every month topics of interest to all of our readers the editors invite correspondence
on all subjects directly or indirectly related to the stories appearing in this magazine only letters of interest to all of our read-
ers will be published and discussed by the editors due to the great influx of mail it is impossible to answer all letters per-
sonally and in case a special personal answer is required a nominal fee of c to cover time and postage is required

critics criticized

editor amazing stories

  i have read the january issue of amazing
stories and certainly enjoyed all the stories
as i did in all the previous issues

  i couldnt resist writing you on the atti-
tude of some of your readers who criticize
your methods

  an editor certainly has some job with the
gimme this and gimme that its a
wonder the magazines dont go to ruin and
the publishers to an asylum

  now if a correspondent would only con-
sider the other readers as he does himself
he could not find fault with your magazine
but no only he himself enjoys reading to
his ideal

  if a reader doesnt like a story why
shouldnt he pass it over and read the next
one the one he almost hates brings joy
and an idea to someone else as an example
we may take the moon hoax if he stop-
ped to realize that the public will pick up
everything but scientific truth he would
see that the moon hoax truly  believed
by many showed the psychology of the many

  some do not like funny stories well as
for me i like a mixture comic sober ex-
citing spiritualistic mysterious gruesome
and your magazine the one great magazine
of scientific literature has satisfied all these
desires

  fosdicks electroplating story hit me so
hard that i immediately coated rats with
graphite and plated them with copper and
also insects were coated in the same manner

  dr oxs experiment also hit me hard i
have been constructing a small yard which
will be almost airtight and small animals
and insects will be experimented on these
two stories are comic yet i found an jdea in
each

  station x i certainly think is a won-
derful masterpiece and i put  dollars in a
low wave transmitter so i could have a
friend of mine who is a physician and pretty
good hypnotist hypnotize a subject the ex-
periment failed this once but im going to
try again

  if a person would follow the science and
invention motto if you do not go beyond
fact you rarely get as far as fact and stop
to consider his fellow readers he would find
no fault with your magazine am i right

  there were only two stories i reallydidnt
enjoy in the magazine since the first issue
but i soon found out that they  were much
admired in some circles now if i put up
my personal objection how could you please
me and them if i dont like a story i let
it pass to the next reader and i certainly
wish the others felt the same

  i can truthfully say that there are seven
stories i derived no idea from but from the
rest i got real good and even tried experi-
ments based on them

  but how do i know what emotions these
seven stories may have caused in other
brains and hearts

  i trust you will be able to publish your
flawless magazine twice a month

             antonio g o gelineau
             burlington vt

  here is a letter that pleases the editor
more perhaps than many others that have
come in here we have at least something
constructive to show where a mans imagin-
ation was aroused to such a degree that he
went out and did things which is as it
should be this is the fulfillment of our
highest hopes namely that amazing stories
will fire the imagination to achieve things
in this world in the editorial of the oc-
tober  issue the editor stated as fol-
lows

  an author in one of his fantastic scien-
tifiction stories may start some one thinking
along the suggested lines which the author
had in mind whereas the inventor in the
end will finish up with something totally
different and perhaps much more important
but the fact remains that the author pro-
vided the stimulus in the first place which
is a most important function to perform

  this is a healthy sign we hope to hear
more from readers who have thus been
stimulated-editor

 from a young reader

editor amazing stories

  i am sixteen years old it is true but
just the same i cant resist praising your
magazine there is something in it which
grips the imagination and sends it to regions
higher than any to which it could e sent
by the ordinary type of fiction  i find it
hard to wait a month for the issues this
month f secured a february copy at your
offices in park place several days before the
magazine appeared on the newsstalls i re-
iterate with many of your readers that
amazing stories should be published twice- a
month i would surely purchase it every two
weeks and many of my friends to whom i
have recommended it would unhesitatingly do
so also

  it may interest you to know that i have
met with an allusion to the moon hoax
which may interest you it is from the north
american review no  october  the
writer is discussing carlyles sartor re-
sartns in short our private opinion is
as we have remarked that the whole story
ie sartor resartusi    has about as
much foundation in truth as the late enter-
taining account of sir john herschels dis-
coveries in the moon

  as to having sequels to such stories as a
columbus of space i think it advisable
not to have them first because sequels are
rarely as good as the originals second be-
cause it would be unwise to introduce too
great a number of lengthy stories dealing
with the same subject

edgar evia new york n y

  this is a very pleasant letter and our
young correspondent in our opinion does
himself great credit by it it is perfectly true
that many sequels have proved great failures
and there is so much good material at hand
that it is f hardly worth while to suggest
special writing of sequels the citation about
carlyles herr teufelsdorsch in this story
about the psychological view of clothes sar-
tor t resartus is quite interesting the
curious thing is that the moon hoax was
firmly believed by thousands-editor

natural history in fiction

 editor amazing stories

    i wish to tell you that  have read with deep in-
 terest your various issues of amazing stories i
 have always been interested in medicine and scien-
 tific subjects and your handling of these matters
 has proved most interesting

    the story of the second deluge was very well
 written and its description of the flood and the
 chaos which it caused in my mind rank with the
 best literature in its descriptive passages the
 island of dr moreau seemed a bit horrible in
 spots but of course was entertaining i really
 prefer something like the red dust one can
 easily close his eyes and imagine himself threading
 these dusky forests with the people of a thousand
 years hence let us hope that civilization may
 go forward and not backward

    some months ago your article on the attack of
 the ants on a brazilian gunboat aroused my curi-
 osity and by consulting encyclopedias i found every
 one of your statements corxect i think such ar-
 ticles with a real scientific basis and giving some
 true facts about natural history or science are a
 real help in the study of science and should prove
 good supplementary reading for the high school and
 college students who too often spend their time in
 reading trashy books with no real value to them
 may amazing stories continue to grow as it has
 in the past

 we agree with our correspondent that the natur-
 al history features of red dust and of the giant
 ant of south america are most interesting and
 striking we believe that such stories as the ones
 cited contain valuable bits of science which can be
 assimilated and made a part of the equipment as
 well as if they came out of a dry text-book-

the moon hoax rotten

 editor amazing stories

    i have just finished reading with great interest
 the discussions in your january  number it
 is not with great surprise therefore that i find one
 fault with amazing stories that i have long
 noticed in science and invention i have read the
 latter since  and the first named since its first
 issue and believe i am qualified to make this critic-
 ism when you receive a letter praising your
 magazine you unqualifiedly agree with it while
 when you receive a letter criticizing the publication
 you declare that the critic is wrong but you do
 not say why i will not desert the stand that i
 wish to take however and knowing from the ex-
 perience of others that you will not agree with me
 i will say together with mr spurling of elgin
  that the moon hoax was-rotten all it
 presented was a string of facts describing an un-
 usual phenomenon this in a scientifiction maga-
 zine true it was fiction in that it was a col-
 ossal hoax but i believe in the manner in which
 scientifiction is supposed to be interpreted this is
 not exactly correct

   i would certainly like to see amazing stories
 in semi-monthly form as this would afford an oppor-
 tunity for mr a b maloirs plan to be put into
 execution to me at least jules vernes stories
 are not old stuff as only two or three of them
 are obtainable at the library that i use and in
 this respect i quite disagree with r h campbell
 of toledo ohio

yours for bigger and better amazing stories

    we are pleased to print the above because it
 gives us an excellent chance to show why for in-
 stance the moon hoax while from mr bow-
 mans standpoint it may be rotten still was good
 enough to fool hundreds and thousands of people
 who actually believed the hoax in qviestion a bit of
 psychology enters into all controversies of this
 kind because what one man likes the other one will
 condemn very few people ever agree on any-
 thing completely it is for instance a simple
 matter to prove that black is not black at all but
 something else  you can take a black inkspot on
 a sheet of white paper which most people may
 call black but when you hold it against strong sun-
 light it becomes grey consequently black is not
 black but grey and so on ad infinitum scienti-
 fiction to our mind is fiction plus science both
 of these requirements we believe were represented
 in a most unusual manner in the moon hoax
 we agree with our correspondent that regarded as
 a story perhaps it is not like the kind that would
 be written today it is old-fashioned as some of
 jules vernes stories are old-fashioned neverthe-
 less they are classics and so was the moon
 hoax -editor j

 four raises in
 two years

 and it hasnt been hard to get them either why
 it seems only yesterday that i was wondering if i
 would ever make as much as  a week and now
 im making 

    tom dawson was speaking about it today gee
 he said i wish i had started studying with the
 i c s when you did here i am plugging away
 at the same old job and the same old salary while
 youve gone way up i bet youre making twice as
 much as i am and to think that two years ago
 we were working side by side

    i told him it wasnt too late if he would only
 make the start and he said he was going to send in
 one of those i c s coupons right away

    i hope he does because an i c s course is the
 very thing he needs to get out of the rut i wouldnt
 be making anywhere near  a week if  hadnt
 started to study just when i did

    every day in office shop and factory you will find
  men who are being given better positions and larger
  salaries because they are studying at home in pare time
  with the international correspondence schools

    an i c s course helped jesse g vincent to rise
 from tool-maker to vice-president of the packard motor
 car company it helped george grieble to rise from
 a stone-mason to the owner of a business paying 
 a year it helped bert  remaley to increase his salary
 ten times and it will help you too if you will only

amazing stories

an invisible spider web

editor amazing stories

  i have just read the man who could van-
ish in your january issue

  in comment i can only repeat your own words
it is the best story of invisibility i have ever
read

  as for the possibility of material things becom-
ing invisible  wish to relate in as few words as
possible a crude instance of the idea

  my sister and i were walking in the florida
woods one day when i noticed about ten or twelve
feet ahead of us one of the large banded spiders
in its beautiful web which was stretched between
the branches of a small tree i could distinctly see
the web with its intricate tracery and its zig-zag
line of heavier tissue the spider also was in plain
sight as large as a bumble-bee

  i tried to point it out to my sister when to my
surprise the spider web and all vanished i
could see the branch where it had been and went
forward to investigate of course i walked right
into the web and the spider quite visible now
ran down over my face and arm and escaped
perhaps you know as i afterward learned and saw
for myself that the zig-zag line of web-tissue is a
spring which on the approach of an enemy the
spider agitates producing so rapid a vibration of
the web that the eye cannot follow it it becomes
invisible just as the spokes of a wheel in rapid mo-
tion become invisible and even transparent to some
extent

  there is an absolutely true story of the vanish-
ing of a living creature house and all perhaps it
may serve as the basis of some future story of in-
visibility help yourselves authors

  to my mind the stories of jules verne wells
poe and other immortals are in excellent company
when reprinted among amazing stories

where will the floods of the
second deluge go

editor amazing stories

  amazing stories is a magazine that hits the
spot with me as no other fiction magazine has ever
done although i do not have any too much time 
to devote to reading i do manage to get through
the book before the next issue comes out

  if you make it a semi-monthly i for one would
welcome a b maloirs suggestion a complete story
in one issue and a bunch of short stories in the
next i think this a very novel idea and would
like to see it tried out

  since reading the second deluge i have been
asking myself repeatedly this question where
would a six-mile layer of water on this earth go to
when it receded even cosmo versals explana-
tion of it seeping into the earths crust seems to
me rather inadequate the idea of it evaporating
into space is of course impossible once it had gath-
ered upon the earth because it could get no
farther than our atmosphere which would hold
no more than a few inches at the most about 
per cent of the earths surface is land and quite a
little of that is solid rock i doubt if even six
miles of hydraulic pressure could force much water
into them

  of course the enormous pressure of the increased
depth over the old ocean beds would exert an up-
heaving influence to the higher ground and perhaps
pop out a few mountain peaks it seems to me
there would never again be much more than  or 
per cent of dry land for millions of years

  the man who could vanish was very good
but the theory seemed rather vague somewhere
several years ago i think it must have been in the
electrical experimenter i read a story in which
invisibility was an issue the principle there was
mirrors and prisms reflecting and refracting the
light around the object

  on the whole i enjoy every one of the stories
even though there may be some little technicality
occasionally which is too much for me to grasp at
once	wesley a kauder

  as to the problem of the six-mile depth of wa-
ters it is admitted that this much water could not
recede into the interior of the earth however it
is quite possible that this condition could have pre-
vailed not only on this planet but on many other
like bodies somewhere in the universe it should
always be remembered that geologically time as
compared to human epochs is infinite it should
furthermore be remembered that a great deal of the
atmosphere and therefore water in the form of
vapor is lost right along into space the grazing
meteorites are responsible for a good deal of this
furthermore at very high points in the atmosphere
the earth continuously loses billions of particles of
air every minute wihile small during the course
of a year-so small in fact that it would be diffi-
cult to measure it-in the course of geological time
such losses reach tremendous figures

  the latest geological time scale based on physics
shows us that the age of mammals-that is the
miocene and oligocene periods-can be placed
about  years ago the mesozoic age of
reptiles dates back at least  years the
paleozoic age of fishes and amphibians dates back at
least  years while the precambrian
dates back at least one billion years during such
time -the losses are of course tremendous and
even a sheet of water six miles deep would have
vanished entirely out into space long before the
passing of such a cycle our water supply even
now is getting smaller and smaller as time goes on
the moon has lost practically all of it and so has
mars-both of these bodies being far older than the
earth

  the point about invisibility regarding the man
who could vanish is explained in the answer to
another letter of one of our correspondents-
editor

 a scientifically disposed critic

editor amazing stories

  one of your writers namely a hyatt verrill
certainly does write amazing stories i am amazed
as to why his crab people should develop a semi-
human mouth a big hooked nose steepled eyes and
big flap ears why should people developed to
such an extent in mental telepathy need ears like
a hunting dog

  why should a civilized people such as those in
through the craters rim walk on their hands
and use their feet when animals such as rats
squirrels kangaroos etc know enough to use the
members nearest their head and eyes

  why should dr unsinn declare that he does not
intend to produce invisibility by causing a body to
permit light rays passing through it how in the
world can invisibility otherwise be produced it is
true that if the reflected light cannot be seen the
object itself cannot be seen but what of the light
rays intercepted by that body if the reflected
light rays of a building are invisible does that
permit reflected light rays from a building in the
next street to pass through the first building un-
altered

                             s w ellis

                              woodlaron pa

  our correspondent asks why mr verrilps crab
people should develop a semi-human mouth a big
hooked nose steepled eyes and big flapped ears
also why should people developed to such an ex-
tent in mental telepathy need ears like a hunting
dog to this we can only answer that if our corre-
spondent has ever visited an aquarium or museum
of natural history he will readily see that the
shapes and varieties of living beings are endless
and most astonishing some of the most fearful
and amazing creatures which have been fished up
or dredged from the depths of the ocean by deep
sea expeditions prove this point there are fish
with a good sawlike instrument other fish are
luminous all oyer while still others have luminous
eves characteristics which have been created by
their curious environment there are so many
things in nature that we can not explain that it
would be futile to try to ennumerate them all
there are many organs in the human body even
such as for instance the appendix for which there
is no good explanation hairs in the face of the
male which certainly are not needed these days and
many other organs which remain for no good
reason as far as we know

  the same answer might hold true about the peo-
ple who walk on their hands it is not at all im-
possible though perhaps a little far-fetched that
such creatures could exist

  regarding the invisibility-we refer to another
letter published here about an invisible spider web
as the correspondent says truly the spokes of a
wheel can not be seen when the wheel is revolv-
ing rapidly the same is true of the blades of
an electric fan or the propeller of an airplane
which certainly are broad and solid you can see
a house or a face right through the blades and
while the object thus viewed may appear a little
darker it is still there with all its characteristics
now take a stick and wave it too and fro rapidly
it becomes invisible is it such a far-fetched idea
then that by means of some apparatus the human
body or anything for that matter may be vilirated
at such a rapidity that although standing station-
ary it will be not seen this is not impossible in
latter-day science-editor
