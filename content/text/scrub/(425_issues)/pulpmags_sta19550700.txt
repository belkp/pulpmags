whence came the knowledge that built the pyra-
mids and the mighty temples of the pharaohs civi-
lization began in the nile valley centuries ago
where did its first builders acquire their astounding wisdom
that started man on his upward climb beginning with
naught they overcame natures forces and gave the world its
first sciences and arts did their knowledge come from a race
now submerged beneath the sea or were they touched with
infinite inspiration from what concealed source came the
wisdom that produced such characters as amenhotep iv
leonardo da vinci isaac newton and a host of others
today it is nown that they discovered and learned to inter-
pret certain secret methods for the development of their
inner power of mind they learned to command the inner
forces within their own beings and to master life this secret
art of living has been preserved and handed down throughout
the ages today it is extended to those who dare to use its
profound principles to meet and solve the problems of life in
these complex times

ment and happiness that you desire if not it is your duty to your-
self to learn about this rational method of applying natural laws for

examples of intelligent awareness those lit-

fiction as youll find it in this and future

wonder and fantastic story

  been reading the newspapers lately
been listening to the radio or watching tele-
vision cheerful on the scientific front eh
especially those reports dealing with atom-
ic fallout cobalt bombs reduction of atomic
boom so that any nation can explode
hell-bombs without tipping its hand con-
tamination of earths atmosphere by a-tests
to the extent that we may destroy our-
selves wihout ever going to war and more
in the same happy vein

the doom of doom

  these bright and cheerful little items
present a rough situation fans and nothing
the fictioneer can dream up on his type-
writer can out-do it therefore the doom
story is doomed and we at startling
stories are glad of it

  this doesnt mean that all will be bub-
hi g joy and laughter in our fiction just
read through this issue and youll see that
we stll recognize human frailties and
mans mortality-with all the struggle and
inherent sadness these concepts entail but
while men must struggle and suffer and die
mail the species goes on

  our newspapers cry of death to humani-
ty  our radio and television sets show mass
murder or suicide fast approaching but
in these pages youre going to find man
going on-the way we feel he definitely
will no pollyannish head-in-sand atti-

silent tears

by bob hoskins

  dear editor i must with many regrets say
that im sorry you have absorbed thrilling won-
der  wonder how long it will be before you
decide that science fiction is no longer a worth-
while field

  through thrilling wonder the family of
magazines can be traced back to the earliest pio-
neering days of science fiction in this country i
am sure that there are thousands of current read-
ers of science fiction and fantasy who got their
start with one of the pines mags whether tws
ss fsm or one of the others you have had 
personally can trace my regular reading of science
fiction back through  when i first saw lords
of the storm before then i had been an oc-
casional reader of many of tic mags usually those
my father or brother brought home-

 as for startling stories it has had
some of the greatest science fiction of all time
appear witliin its pages two of my own favor-
ites appeared in quick succession in - fred
browns what mad ilikcrsc and arthur c
clarkes aiains tits fall oi xight both of these
stories i have read over and over with my en-
joyment of them never diminishing

 i also have to thank ss and tws for my
early activities among active fandom for it was
in the various fan columns now long defunct
that i first heard the magic word fanzine and
first found many of my contacts several of whom
 number among my best friends today

  science fiction is a diminishing field there is
no disputing that fact but one can always steal
a few silent tears in memory of an old departed
friend without too much fear of public scorn
sure much of the material of recent years has
been pure corn but a great deal of it has been
continued-on ptifie

until that day comes i will still read over and

that i cannot bear to part with-lyons falls

  we think youre taking a rather pessi-
mistic approach bob as we stated before
where theres life theres hope-and change
the combining of our three magazines into
one does not necessarily mean the loss of
any of them its a change sure and an
experimental change at that but with the
proper support from our readers-and that

goody for us

by trina perlson

  dear editor i never could see why one pub-
lishing house and one editor should put out three
magazines it seemed so silly especially the way
each one came out a different month you might
as well have been publishing one mag under three
different names the only part i dont like is the
fact that startling is still quarterly but from
what ive heard i gather that the science fiction
business is quiet and maybe later on youll be
able to publish startling as a monthly hmtnm

  as usual i have a complaint i sir am sick
of all these misogynist stories where the women
are matriarchs or from another planet or against
the poor mistreated males in one way or another
i am a nice nomal girl whose one ambition is
to marry barbara huttons son and never once
has a woman patted me on the back winked con-
spiratorially and said poor men they dont
know but we know dont we i dont belong
to any secret womens organizations i dont hate
men and although i guess id be able to survive
alone on a desert island id much rather have a
male-type human there with me and at the
moment i am suffering from a sorer throat than
any man i know

  why ill bet you men are the ones who are
plotting against us you dont see judith merrill
or leigh bracket or kathleen macclean writing
anything nasty about men do you -- 
street south ozone park new york

  thanks for the vote of confidence on our
new combination magazine as for your
comments on bryce waltons novel too
late for eternity you cant fool us we
know thats just the party line-the wom-
ans-immortality-party line that is and
your sore throats cant compare to wal-

tons hangovers however you hit the
mark when you said we men are plotting
against you women ye old editorial board
is at this moment hatching a grand plot
against a trim little immortal in the next
office- but thats speaking of the sublime
and what were about to deal with is the
ridiculous

letter from two bems

by john musselis and ralph butcher

  dear editor we are sitting here a copy of
rogels thesaurus and collected pornography by
our respective elbows and having nothing better
to do will honor you with a missive pinioned to
the wall across the room is the winter tws
twitching and writhing first we notice the
cover which is far better than usual both in
subject and artwork more of these and less
gaudy flashy covers would be a relief frank
kelly freas interior was his consistent best and
surprisingly enough it was well reproduced usu-
ally freas doesnt come out quite so well in pulp
mags as in the slicks finlay must be slipping
somehow his art doesnt have the same-well
feeling it did a couple of years ago it looks about
the same but somehow something has been lost
or left out

  next we release good ol tws and struggling
madly cart it over to a table where we weigh it
down with books cadavers and various other
handy objects so we can take a gander at its
inards first to the letter page

 marion zimmer bradley yes we have a
question just how pray tell do you suggest we
round up all the women and make them  
coiftcious of themselves as mammals first and
egocentric personalities second without making
mindless animals out of them or resorting to
communistic tactics as soon as you work that
out come around and well see what we can do
for you

  oh yes and about that mutation business mu-
tation is defined by webster as variation in
character offspring departing from standard of
parents suddenly not by graded steps through
generations under the foregoing and what
science has done to add to the chances of human
survival multiple births may well be the next
major mutation of the human race

  rudolph franchi promotion to satellite was

    complete novelet by robert f yoljxci

                              v

       her pupils handed in the usual run of compositions
       but she found one that was out of this world   

                                                             i

     v father bought a new ford a
red one and i spent my summer
vacation mostly riding in my fathers ford
my fathers ford is the fastest car ever and
when he opens it up on sunday it seems
like the other cars are standing still i had
a uonderful summer vacation riding in my
fathers red ford

  abruptly miss ellis decided to grade the
rest of the how i spent my summer
vacation compositions at mrs harpers
ordinarily she did all of her work in the

classroom leaving her evenings free for
tv but there were times when the class-
room seemed despite its unobtrusive mod-
ern architecture and its modernistic vista
of close-cropped lawn and youthful elms
like asetting out of dostoevskis crime
and punishment-

  she enclosed the compositions in a
manila folder then straightened her desk
aligning the books between the sphinx
bookends making a military echelon of the
pencils and shoving everything that would
not lend itself to a geometric pattern into a



startling stories

convenient drawer mr findley frequently
checked the classrooms before going home
and he loved to leave little notes on the
teachers desks sarcastic little notes allud-
ing to stray papers undisciplined pencils
and careless teachers

  miss ellis winced a little at the thought
of mr findley it was the beginning of
her second year under his command and
from all indications it was going to le a
repetition of her first not that air find-
ley wasnt a good principal he was young
and ambitious and with the exception of
the national guard he put his work above
everything and not only that he was
exceedingly handsome in a neat refined
way-not that it really mattered of course
-and he cut a fine figure in his blue serge
suit walking militarily up and down the
school corridors and along the streets of
tompkinsville

  but he did have some rather exacting
ideas about the way elementary schools
should be run-

  thinking of mr findley miss ellis al-
most forgot her window shades and that
was odd because uniformity of window
shades was number  on his list of musts
for model teachers they were one of the
main reasons why his pre-breakfast con-
stitutional took him past the school she
was halfway down the corridor before she
remembered them she returned hurriedly
to her room and lowered the bottom ones
to exactly half the height of the bottom
windows and raised the upper ones to
exactly half the height of the upper win-
dows leaving her room again she ex-
haled a little sigh of relief it had been a
narrow escape

  outside she verified a theory she had
been entertaining all afternoon the weath-
er had turned out to be lovely it was still
lovely though the dampness of approach-
ing evening was beginning to permeate the
hazy air she strolled down the school
walk in the mild september sunlight think-
ing of how nice it would be if mrs harp-
ers boarding house was on the other side
of town instead of right across the street
she felt like walking she wanted to walk
and walk and walk-

  but she couldnt of course not without
a sensible reason aimless strolling was
one of the many behaviorisms which mr

findley classified as being detrimental to
the dignity of the faculty so she simply
crossed the street beneath the big over-
arching maples and let herself into mrs
harpers enclosed front porch

  her room was at the end of the upstairs
hall overlooking an expanse of shed roof
and a brief vista of backyard she closed
the door quietly sat down on the bed and
took off her shoes there was time to grade
a few compositions before dinner so she
rested the folder on her lap and armed her-
self with a red pencil

  she reread the first composition and
graded it c minus she went on to the
next-

  we built a tree house and we started a
club only kids living on our block could
belong to the club we called ourselfs the
tigers and we lived in our tree house all
summer and garded our block from the
kids that dident live on it when those
kids came around we climbed down from
our tree house and chased them away

b

  this is the way i spent my sumer
vacation i got a new girls too wheeler for
my birthday in july and all sumer i rode
my too wheeler its a speshul delux too
wheeler with a siren a seled beem hedlite a
basket and wite side waited tires the color

  my father said alpha ophiuchi  ought
to be a good place to spend our summer
vacation and my mother said all right lets
go and it was you should see all the
blue lakes and the silver mountains we
rematerialised in whynn the capital and
we rented a cabin on one of the lakes and
all summer we sailed on the lake and fished
it was a marvelous summer vacation

miss ellis frowned she expected
her pupils to evince tendencies toward
object-worship and ethnocentrism when
she assigned them a composition to write
an apple for

but she didnt expect them to use the com-
position as a medium for imaginative litera-
ture

  and then her annoyance gave way to
amusement alpha ophiuchi  indeed
and blue lakes and silver mountains smil-
ing she marked c minus abotfe the title
and wrote no more science fiction
please in parentheses

  and then she noticed the paper

  it bore little resemblance to the cheap
tablet paper which the other compositions
were written on for one thing it had no
lines and for another thing it was un-
usually heavy but by far the most re-
markable feature about it was its rich
bluish texture someones been into their
parents stationery she thought and held
it up to the light to see the watermark

  instantly tiny wire-like fibers material-
ized around the borders and began to glow
the paper misted and a scene formed be-
hind it-a three dimensional miniature of
an exotic lake nestling amid stately silver
mountains that rose breathlessly into an
awesome cobalt sky there was a sail-
boat on the lake and in the sailboat there
were three people-two adults and a little
boy

  it was as though the paper had taken the
words on its surface and transformed them
into the scene they described miss ellis
hands were shaking when she lowered it to
her lap immediately the miniature faded
away and the paper regained its former
opacity the writing reasserted itself and
the borders ceased to glow

  she looked at the name in the upper
right hand corner lyle lylequest jr
grade  while it was rather early in the
semester for her to be able to visualize her
pupils merely by seeing their names she
found that she could visualize lyle lyle-
quest jr quite easily and that was odd
because he was just about the most average
child in her class both in his appearance
and in his actions too average perhaps

  miss ellis shook her head sharply and
brought the headlong rush of her thoughts
to an abrupt halt im letting my imagina-
tion run away with me she thought i
wonder if i really saw that scene at all the
paper rested innocently on her lap so in-
nocently that she couldnt resist holding it
up to the light again to prove to herself

the teacher	

that it really was what she had taken it for 
in the first place-a sheet of expensive
stationery which a small boy had swiped
from either his mothers or fathers desk to
make an impression on his teacher

  instantly the wire-like fibers leaped into
luminescence and the miniature reformed
and this time the cobalt sky seemed more
awesome than before-so vast and deep
and interminable that miss ellis grew cold
and frightened just looking at it she
jerked the paper out of the light and
dropped it on the bed she got up and went
over to the window and looked out at the
prosaic shed roof and the perfectly ordinary
backyard

  there was a reassuring quality about the
afternoon sunlight a friendliness about the
hazy september sky gradually her fright
left her im behaving like a silly over-
imaginative schoolgirl she thought ill bet
it i showed that sheet of paper to lyles
parents and told them what im thinking
theyd laugh their heads off

  and then the thought struck her-why
not show it to them why not ask them
about it just to see what theyd say and
why not tonight  that coarse comic tippy
charm was on tv and she certainly
didnt want to watch him and as for the
how i spent my summer vacation
compositions shed have plenty of time to
grade them when she got back

 n

the lylequests lived in an aver-
age residential section there was a
light burning on the old fashioned front
porch and another one shining in the big
living room window miss ellis paid the
cab driver and walked up the spiraea-bor-
dered walk to the porch she climbed the
steps a little timidly and rang the doorbell

  presently a tall willowy man opened the
door and regarded her rather blankly with
faded blue eyes he was quite young and
his features were pleasant in an unspectac-
ular kind of way he looked like a person
who was a little bewildered by the events
transpiring in the world around him-in
other words an average citizen

  for a moment miss ellis felt ridiculous
then she remembered the cobalt sky mr
lylequest she asked


startling stories

  yes

  im miss ellis lyles teacher i-im
afraid im being rather officious mr lyle-
quest but theres something id like to dis-
cuss with you about lyle

  mr lylequests eyes came gradually to
life come in please he said i hope
lyle hasnt done anything serious

   oh no nothing like that miss ellis
preceded him into the hall you see yes-
terday i gave my class a composition to
write a their first homework assignment
-you know the usual one about how they
spent their summer vacation-and this aft-
ernoon when i was reading lyles i
couldnt help but notice the kind of paper
hed used

  mr lylequest paused in the hall what
kind of paper did he use

  i- i thought at first it was simply an
expensive variety of stationery but when
i held it up to the light to see what make
it was it formed a picture of the scene hed
described in his composition i was kind
of upset i mean the scene was so strange
so- perhaps id better show it to you i
have it right here she tumbled in her
purse found the composition and handed
it to him

  a small woman with tiny exquisite fea-
tures suddenly appeared in the living room
doorway stationery she said sharply
she would have been beautiful miss ellis
thought if it hadnt been for her complex-
ion her diminutive face was positively
gray-

  but so was mr lylequests miss ellis
noticed though it was funny that she hadnt
noticed it before he had unfolded the pa-
per and was holding it up to the hall light
his blue eyes werent in the least faded
now she began to feel uncomfortable

presently he lowered the paper and
read the words on its surface he raised
his eyes to the woman in the doorway
lylla this is miss ellis lyles teacher
he turned to miss ellis miss ellis this
is my wife

  how do you do miss ellis did you
say something about stationery

  how do you do miss ellis said i
was just showing mr lylequest lyles
composition i-i was curious about the
paper he used

  mrs lylequest seemed to flutter in the
doorway let me see she said she
fairly snatched the composition out of her
husbands hands and held it up to the light
why-why its a sheet of our novelty
stationery our-our stereoscopic station-
ery she lowered the paper and hastily
read the composition she seemed to flut-
ter again why-such a silly way to de-
scribe it she said looking intently at
miss ellis

  miss ellis was confused describe
what

  why the mountain lake scene of course
hes made up an imaginary vacation to
match the stereo picture alpha ophiuchi
 she turned to her husband what
in the world is alpha ophiuchi 

  sounds like it might be a star mr
lylequest said vaguely

  a star mrs lylequest laughed it
was rather thin laughter miss ellis
thought imagine him putting one of our
pretty little stereo lakes on a star

  but i thought- miss ellis began

  mr lylequest bought the stationery
last time he was in the city didnt you
dear

  why yes yes i did mr lylequest
said i noticed it in some little out of the
way novelty shop-ive forgotten just what
street it was on i thought it was rather
clever so i picked it up

  oh miss ellis said it was such a
simple explanation and here shed been
thinking- she felt her face grow warm
and yet there had been something uncanny
about that cobalt sky something frighten-
ing a thought occurred to her doyou
have any more of the stationery she
asked

  oh yes lots of it mr lvlequest said
we-

  its all the same though mrs lyle-
quest interrupted so there wouldnt be
any point in our showing it to you were
being terribly rude miss ellis keeping you
out here in the hall like this wont you
come in and sit down

  why yes thank you miss ellis said
but i can only stay a little while

  the living room was spacious and in-
formal lyle was sitting at one end of the
studio couch that faced the television set
reading a comic book he looked up
an apple for the teacher



hello miss ellis lie said

  hello lyle diffidently she sat down
on the opposite end of the couch i feel
kind of guilty breaking in on you people
like this she said bothering you about
such an inconsequential matter nervous-
ly her eyes went from mrs lylequest who
had sat down beside her to mr lylequest
who was in the process of sitting down in
an adjacent armchair to the floor to the
television screen why she said in sud-
den surprise what program is that

the scene ill progress was unusual
to say the least it consisted as far as
miss ellis could ascertain of a many-sided
geometric figure moving erratically before
several ranks of similar though much
smaller figures as she watched the fore-
most figure subtly added another side to
the accompaniment of a series of noises that
sounded like arithmetic set to music one
by one the other figures followed suit by
that time mr lylequest his chair forgot-
ten was bending over the dials and when
he straightened up again there was nothing
on the screen but the moon face of comic
tippy charm mr lylequest was staring
at mrs lylequest-rather desperately it
seemed to miss ellis-and mrs lylequest
was staring back at him her gray complex-
ion more noticeable than ever mr charms
jokes had scarcely any effect upon the si-
lence that crept into the room

  it-it seemed almost like a foreign sta-
tion miss ellis said presently do you
have a special antenna

  mr lylequest turned toward her slow-
ly his willowy body seemed to relax
why yes miss ellis as a matter of fact
we do lie said he came over and re-
sumed the process of sitting down in the
armchair this time he made it we pick-
up some of the weirdest stations some-
times he went on i cant imagine where
they originate from

  that one was certainly weird enough
miss ellis said

  mrs lylequest emitted a thin laugh
wasnt it though she turned to lyle
whose button of a nose was buried in the
comic book dont you think its time you
went to bed dear

  lyle got up dutifully yes mother
lie said

  your fathers going to have a talk with
you in the morning about that sheet of sta-
tionery you took out of his desk whatever
made you do such a thing

  lyles round face was expressionless
im sorry mother i needed some paper
and that was all i could find he pro-
ceeded to kiss mr and mrs lylequest
good night-somewhat distastefully miss
ellis thought good night mother good
night dad he said he paused in front
of miss ellis and looking into his big
brown eyes she had the absurd notion that
deep inside of him he was laughing at her
abruptly he said good night miss
ellis and ran out of the room she heard
the clatter of his footsteps as he climbed the
hall stairs 

  i cant understand his taking that sta-
tionery mr lylequest said ordinarily
he never does anything he shouldnt

  its the most unusual stationery ive
ever seen miss ellis said i still cant
get over it i wonder-

  how is school going this year miss
ellis mrs lylequest asked

  why rather well so far oh weve had
the usual confusion of course but mr
findley savs that faking everything into
consideration weve done a pretty efficient
job of getting the semester under way
mrs lyleqnest leaned forward her blue
eyes bright mr findley

  mr findleys our elementary school
principal miss ellis explained hes
quite obsessed about efficiency i- dont
mean to say he isnt a nice principal she
went  quickly its just that-well hes
quite enthusiastic over the national guard
and i suppose its only natural that he
should carry over some of his military
standards to the elementary school but
that doesnt mean-

  is he handsome mrs lylequest in-
ter rupted	

  oh yes hes very hand- miss ellis
paused abruptly she felt her face grow
hot i mean she amended he makes a
very fine looking principal hes always so
neat and good look-  mean-

  is he married

  oh no she almost recoiled before the
calculating look that leaped into mrs lyle-
quests eyes

  mrs lylequest s face had lost its gray-


ness it was radiant now
he

  i-im really not sure about twenty-
nine or thirty i think i-i guess id bet-
ter go now its getting kind of late and i
have quite a few compositions to correct
before i go to bed

  how old are you

  lylla mr lylequest said sharply
im twenty-four miss ellis said cool-
ly i wonder if youd call me a cab please
mr lylequest

why of course mr lylequest got up
hastily of course you really dont have
to leave yet he said picking up the phone
im afraid i must miss ellis said

she thought the cab would never
come but it finally did she got up hur-
riedly in the middle of the strained con-
versation that had followed mrs lyle-
quests unexpected inquisition and said
good night mr lylequest accompanied
her into the hall im glad you dropped
in on us miss ellis he said opening the
door for her i hope youll visit us again
she looked at him uncertainly his blue
eyes were empty the brightness that had
come into them when he had read the com-
position had already faded away thank
you she said perhaps i will good
night mr-

  she had no idea what made her glance
up the stairs iyle was standing in the up-
stairs hall looking down at her there was
no reason why the sight of him should have
unnerved her no reason at all he was
just a small tousle-haired boy clad in ski
pajamas indulging in the most natural
childhood pastime in the world-spying on
the grown-ups and yet there was a slight
difference

  small boys are generally awed at the
doings of grown-ups

  lyle seemed amused

  miss ellis ran out of the house and down
the walk to the ab mrs harpers she
told the driver breathlessly as the cab
pulled away she glanced through the rear
window at the lylequests rooftop it was
too dark for her to get a good view of their
antenna but the view she did get was suffi-
cient to convince her that it wasnt particu-
larly different from mrs harpers antenna
and mrs harper did well to pick up the

next county on her set to say nothing of
picking up a foreign country

  and that reminds me miss ellis
thought they didnt return the composi-
tion to me either

ill

he decided on a hot bath before
tackling the rest of the compositions
she lay in the tub for a long time trying
to get the lylequests out of her mind in a
way she almost wished she hadnt visited
them she wasnt at all satisfied with mrs
lylequests explanation of the stationery
and now she had two additional enigmas
to contend with-mr lylequests deliber-
ate lie about his tv antenna and mrs
lylequests inexplicable interest in mr
findley and that wasnt even counting
lyles equally inexplicable amusement

  resolutely miss ellis stood up in the
tub and began to dry herself im just not
going to think about them any more to-
night she told herself ive got enough
things to think about without thinking
about them she put on her nightgown
and negligee and returned to her room
the compositions were lying on the led
where she had left them that afternoon
for some reason she had even less desire
to grade them now than shed had at school

  she made up her mind that hereafter she
would get her work done in the classroom
regardless of its oppressive atmosphere and
omnipresent window shades but hereafter
wasnt tonight wearily she pulled the
rooms only table over to the edge of the
bed placed the compositions on the table
and sat down on mrs harpers faded coun-
terpane determinedly she gripped her red
pencil-

  my mother said not to play with freddy
next door so last summer i minded my
mother and pretended not to see freddy
when he hollered at me row the jence
then my mother came out one day and
chased freddy away i was glad yet i was
sad to in a way but my mother said i
should not play with little boys uith snotty
noses that i should practice my lessons on
the piano instead so all summer i prac-
ticed czerny on the piano my mother says
that some day i will be a great pianist

startling stories

how old is
an apple for

and perhaps she will miss ellis
thought shell certainly need to he to
make up for all her lost childish laughter
and all the summer afternoons shell never
get to know

 a she wrote

she was relieved when she finally came
to the last composition-

                          

i had a good time on my summer vaca-
tion ajter all my father said he was going

a word about this issue

fteachers colleges give courses in elementary secondary and collegiate-level
education they teach teachers to teach they formulate methods of dealing
with sluggish brains recalcitrant personalities and even psychotic and criminal
types on the side student teachers may take up boxing hypnotism judo and
barroom sluggery in order to protect themselves against the more mischevious of
their future pupils but youll agree that miss ellis in an apple for the
teacher faces a problem that no amount of study even on phd level can solve

  bryce waltons awakening deals with a different type of education-the
education of an individual as to the actual worth of his-pardon her-pardon if
society during the course of this education a truly touching and significant
story unfolds one which will convince many readers that walton is rapidlj moving
to the top of the class as a writer of serious fiction

  murray leinster is his old dependable self in white spot an adventure that
moves through a terrifying world where everything is dead-everything that is but
the white spot and what is the white spot its the most terrifying villain
weve come across in a long time its an omnivorous omnipotent thing that puny
humans cant possibly stand up to but they do

the teacher	

 didnt feel like going to bed she wanted
 to get dressed and go out and walk along
 the cool deserted streets in the autumn
 quietness to lose herself the way she some-
 times did in summer on her fathers farm
 and become a part of the earth and the sky
 and the moment

  but she couldnt of course not as long
as mr-findley was her commanding offi-
cer

  she pushed the table back to its accus-

to take me fishing up to canada and  saved
my money all winter and bought a new
fishing rod and a new real then my fa-
ther said he couldent make it and he bought
me a dog instead at first  was real mad
but then i thought of teeching the dog
tricks it was a dumb dog but im a good
teecher i made him sit up and ly down
and walk on to legs  call the dog bum
he likes me every time he sees me he gets
down and crawls up to me on his belly and
ivags his tale

miss ellis sat there quietly for a long
time after awhile she leaned forward
and wrote c minus above the title she
shuddered

  she was tired but for some reason she

tomed place against the wall she returned
the compositions to the manila folder and
laid the folder on the table she turned out
the light and slipped out of her negligee

  she lay there in the darkness and
thought of simple reassuring things of the
artless little stories in the fourth grade
reader of the books she had read when she
was a little girl-of the six little bunk-
ers at grandpa fords and the bobbsey
twins on the deep blue sea of the love-
ly little villages the bus had passed through
on the trip back to tompkinsville of the
way poplar trees twinkle in a summer
wind-

  but it didnt do any good the dream
just waited patiently till sleep touched her
then it leaped from the jumbled ambus-
startling stories



cade of her subconscious

  it was its first appearance of the semes-
ter but it began the way it always had the
year before mr findley left his house and
started around the block on his pre-break-
fast constitutional there was no intima-
tion that a new episode had been added un-
til after he turned down the street that led
past the school then the dog appeared
from somewhere and crawled up to him
wagging its tail

  mr findley stopped when he saw it
he regarded it contemplatively sit up
he said presently the dog looked up at
him with meek brown eyes sit up mr
findley said again the dog continued to
lie there wagging its tail sit up miss
ellis pleaded dear god please make it
sit up sit up mr findley said for the
last time abruptly his foot lashed out and
the dog rolled over and over miss ellis
thought it would never stop rolling final-
ly though it nianaged to scramble to its
feet it ran away then screaming

  the rest of the dream followed the usual
pattern mr findley walked past the
school scrutinizing the window sliades he
began with the third floor like he always
did saving the first till the last symmetry
prevailed on the third floor on the second
mr findleys eyes began a slow deliberate
traversal of the first stopped there was
something appallingly wrong with the sec-
ond sequence instead of symmetry stark
dishevelment prevailed one of the shades
had been lowered all the way another had
been raised all the way the remaining
ones hadnt even been unrolled mr find-
ley stopped in his tracks he whipped out
his little black notebook and made a vicious
little entry miss ellis he wrote stab-
bingly insubordination-

  miss ellis was sitting up in bed she
was trembling mentally she ran across
the street to the school and down the cor-
ridor to her room she imagined lowering
each bottom shade to half the height of
each bottom window and raising each up-
per shade to half the height of each upper
window

  finally when she was absolutely sure
she lay back upon the sweat-soaked sheets
and the damp pillow

  it was hours before she got to sleep
again

            iv

he following morning when
she left the house miss ellis had an
idea  know what ill do she decided
crossing the street beneath the big over-
arching maples ill give the class a word
association test

  it was a scintillating september day and
the warm sunlight dancing on the school
windows and lying whitely on the school
walks made her suspicions of the lyle-
cjuests seem a little fanciful but just the
same a word association test wont do any
harm she told herself hurrying down the
corridor maybe ill find out where they
really did spend their vacation

  all of her pupils were present when she
entered the classroom no matter how
hard she tried she could never start the day
early there were so many last minute
things to do-lipstick she was never sure
just how much to use a touch of rouge
the merest touch  and then her hair was
never right and it always took her last
precious moments to pat it into a semblance
of conventionality arising a little earlier
would have helped of course but how
could you get up early when youve hardly
slept at all

  mr findley had a brisk good morn-
ing for her when he stopped in on his
morning rounds he seemed even more
handsome than usual in his neat blue serge
suit a speckless white handkerchief
peeped geometrically out of his breast
pocket and his dark hair positively
gleamed thinking of the dream- miss
ellis couldnt meet his eyes she felt
ashamed-and a little bit desperate

 after he had gone she began the word
association test take a clean sheet of
paper and write your name and grade in
the upper right hand corner she told her
pupils number the first five lines  
   now as soon as i say the first
word i want you to write down another
word that it makes you think of after the
numeral one ready 

  paper she said glancing at lyle
lylequest

  there was a flurry of pencils

  now the second word write down the
word it makes you think of after the num-
eral two desk
an apple for the teacher	

  she saved the most important word till
the last she said it nonchalantly not look-
ing at lyle vacation then she col-
lected the papers making sure that lyles
was among the first that she picked up
just in case he decided to make any last
minute alterations

  she didnt really think he would of
course

  when she sat down behind her desk she
discovered that her hands were trembling
and she forced herself to read the papers in
order in an effort to calm herself most of
her pupils she found had associated pen-
cil with paper work with desk
love with mother milton berle or
howdy doody with television and
farm beach camp-in-the-woods
etc with vacation

  presently the familiar lyle lylequest
jr grade  came into view miss ellis
was almost- afraid to read the five neatly-
written words that stared innocently up at
her after she did read them her hands
were trembling worse than before

  lyle had associated transmutation
with paper love with desk work
with mother and ballet with tele-
vision

  after the numeral corresponding to
vacation he had written alpha opchiu-
chi 

  gradually miss ellis fright gave way to
anger was lyle trying to annoy her she
stole a glance at him half expecting to see
amusement in his eyes but he was a pic-
ture of innocence sitting there behind his
little desk and if there was anything in
his eyes at all it was respect-the natural
respect youd expect any normal fourth
grade pupil to evince in the presence of his
teacher with a little bit added

  but why shpuld he have such preposter-
ous associations she could understand his
associating transmutation with paper
though it was a rather large word for a
little boy to contain in his vocabulary and it
certainly conflicted with mrs lylequests
explanation of the stationery but why
should he associate ballet with televi-
sion except for a dash of maria tall-
chief now and then tv didnt go in much
for ballet it was more of a medium for
arthur murray and why of all things
should he associate work with moth-

er well perhaps mrs lylequest made
him wipe the dishes now and then miss
ellis thought but still it wasnt natural

  and it definitely wasnt natural for him
to associate alphao ophiuchi  with
vacation

  unless you assumed that he read science
fiction from morning to night and lived in
a universe all of his own and you virtual-
ly had to assume it because the only alter-
native was to admit that the lylequests
really were-

  probably miss ellis interrupted the pre-
cipitate rush of her thoughts hed write a
composition about being a spaceman on the
alpha ophiuchi  sol  run if i gave
him half a chance and then the thought
occurred to her-why not give him the
chance if he borrowed some more of his
parents stationery so much the better be-
cause if the stationery was capable of creat-
ing a scene out of deep space shed know
once and for all whether she was dealing
with a daydreaming little boy or a-

  she stood up abruptly get out your
assignment notebooks she told her pupils
im going to give you part of tomorrows
homework assignment now

  there was a prolonged rustling of pa-
pers followed by eight rows of upturned
attentive faces for tomorrow miss
ellis said i want each of you to write a
short comiosition titled what i want to
be when i grow up 

tt was one thing to be brave in the
morning with the bright sunshine
streaming reassuringly all around you but
it was quite another thing to be brave in
the afternoon with the last pupil departed
and the classroom once again acquiring
some of the oppressive shadings of a dos-
toevski setting

  what if he does use his parents station-
ery miss ellis thought suppose he does
write a composition about wanting to be a
spaceman on the alpha ophiuchi  sol 
ruic or describe some equally fantastic
ambition what kind of a picture will i
see

  suppose the lylequests really do turn
out to be-to be aliens

  but thats impossible she told herself
utterly impossible things like that hap-
pen in those silly movies they make now
	startling stories

and then the- dont happen in real life
they dont happen in the fourth grade of a
little elementary school in a small town
they just cant happen in tompkinsville

  but suppose just suppose

   i really should tell someone about it she
decided just in case

  but it was one thing to decide to tell
someone and quite another thing to decide
whom to tell she thought of miss tingue
the ascetic fifth grade teacher she shook
her head miss tingue wasnt the type of
person you confided in for the simple rea-
son that you could never get past the bar-
rier of her bleak countenance there was
miss averill of course the other fourth
grade teacher miss ellis shook her head
again she had always felt uncomfortable
in the scintillating presence of miss averill
and she couldnt imagine talking to her
about anything more complex than the lat-
est gregory peck movie

  suddenly mr findley stepped into her
mind

  the reaction that occurred was as be-
wildering to miss ellis as it would have
been to mr findley had he been present
physically she had an overwhelming urge
to run to him and tell him- everything to
cling to him and feel his blue serge lapel
against her cheek his staunch shoulders re-
assuringly close and before she was fully
aware of what she was doing she found
herself running down the corridor to his
office and raising her hand to knock on
his austere paneled door

  but her hand did not descend as she
stood there poised her heart pounding she
had a vivid vision of mr findley sitting
militarily behind his barren desk a prac-
tical-minded captain just waiting for some
overimaginative pfc to barge into his
sanctum sanctorum and disturb the digni-
fied echelons of his thoughts with some
improbable story about flying saucers land-
ing on the parade ground and martians
raiding the px

  she shrank back from the door just as
she did so the door opened she was off
balance anyway and the slight impetus
which the door lent her when it struck her
shoulder was enough she sat down rather
forcibly on the corridor floor

  for a moment she was too shocked to
move with horrified eyes she watched

mr findley emerge from his office he
stared down at her his eyes round with
astonishment why miss ellis he said
im terribly sorry i had no idea you were
standing there

  he helped her to her feet acting as
though he were handling some extremely
fragile piece of military paraphernalia for-
tunately miss ellis had landed on the
least vulnerable portion of her body and
no great damage bad been done-execept
to her dignity

  did you want to see me about some-
thing miss ellis

  miss ellis face was incandescent oh
no mr findley she said i just hap-
pened to be passing when you opened your
door she turned and half ran back to her
room she closed her door tightly and
leaned against it

   it was some time before her face cooled
and an even longer time before she began
to put her desk in order she straightened
the books between the sphinx bookends and
made a military echelon of the pencils she
shoved everything that would not lend it-
self to a geometric pattern into a convenient
drawer then she went over to the win-
dows and carefully aligned the shades

  she left the school walked down the
school walk and crossed the street beneath
the big over-reaching maples thinking of
mr findley	

television was terrible that night
and mrs harpers parlor seemed even
stuffier than usual miss ellis excused
herself in the middle of a program and
went upstairs to bed

   she lay there in the darkness and thought
of twinkling poplar tree and winding
country roads of the artless little stories in
the fourth grade reader and her childhood
books of bunny brown arid his sister
sue and the six little bunkers at uncle
freds and in addition she thought of an
experience shed had when she was a little
girl

  it had been late in spring or perhaps
early in summer shed had a bad dream
and the dream awakened her and she got
out of bed and dressed still half asleep and
ran barefooted out of the house and into
the misted morning the dream accom-
panied her as she ran across the farm yard
an apple for

and into the fields and she kept hoping that
the sun would come up

  she wanted to see light and life around
her the color of grass and trees the re-
assuring blue of sky

  but the sun didnt come up and she ran
on and on the dew of the fields like ice
beneath her feet turning her feet blue and
sending chills up her thin childs legs till
her whole body was trembling presently
she came to the pasture and saw the dim
shapes of her fathers cows and heard their
lowing and she climbed the pasture fence
her feet found a spot where one of the
cows had slept and the lingering animal
warmth engulfed her at that very mo-
ment the sun peeped over the distant hills
and sent its warm rays streaming through
the mist and what had been a desolate
phantasmagoric world a moment before
became abruptly an enchanted world
flecked with a trillion motes of purest sun-
diamonds a world of warmth and hope and
happiness a world brimming with kind-
ness and security-

  she fell asleep and the dream returned
again

  mr findley didnt care about worlds
brimming with kindness and security he
left his doorstep on schedule and started
around the block the dog was right on
schedule too putting in its meek appear-
ance as soon as mr findley turned down
the street that led past the school in fact
there was no intimation at all that the
episodes second appearance was going to
be any different from its first appearance
until after mr findleys third sit up
then something odd happened to his face

it lost its military self-righteousness for a
moment and a quality akin to compassion
touched it like a ray of morning sunshine
and instead of kicking the dog he bent over
and patted it on the head

  but he was still adamant about the win-
dow shades and after he had scrutinized
them he wrote his usual vicious little entry
in his little black notebook miss ellis
insulordination and then miss ellis
was sitting up in bed again trembling re-
turing mentally to the school and frenzied-
ly raising and lowering her shades and
afterwards lying in the lonely darkness
through the long lonely hours trying des-
perately to sleep

  miss ellis had been late as usual and
the what i want to be when i grow
up compositions had been lying on her
desk where her pupils had left them she
wanted to riffle through them till she came
to a certain one on heavy bluish paper but
she couldnt find the courage she graded
the first one c and hurried on to the
next hardly aware of what she was read-
ing

  i am going to be like my father zvho is a
osteopathe when people come to my ofice
i am going to crack their necks and backs
and then they will give me mony like they
do my father i dont knozv what they give
my father mony for cracking their necks
and backs for but they do lots of it so an
osteopathe is what i am going to be when-

  then out of the corner of her eye she
glimpsed a familiar bluish border courage
ceased to be a factor as curiosity took over

  when i grozv up i want to be a psycho-
therapist not just an ordinary psycho-
therapist but the kind that specializes in
indizndual regression in subnormal cul-
tures there are so many sub-normal cul-
tures in the galaxy particularly in the
peripheral sectors that my race has all it
can do to send out enough field workers to
apply the necessary corrective measures

  psycho-therapy was so remote from the
description of the alpha ophiuchi  sol 
run which miss ellis had expected that
lyles composition despite its potential
implications was almost an anti-climax
nevertheless her hands were shaking
when she held the paper up to the morning
sunlight that was streaming through the
windows

her hands steadied of their own accord
	startling stories

for if the composition had been an anti-
climax the three dimensional miniature
which the paper created was an anti-anti-
climax it consisted of nothing more than
a stereoscopic view of the three lylequests
sitting on the studio couch in their own
living room

  she was still staring at it when mrs
lylequest entered the classroom fluttered
over to the desk and snatched the paper
out of her hands

  fm sorry to have been so rude mrs
lylequest said but when  discovered
that lyle had been into our stationery
again i simply had to do something about
it

  miss ellis was standing numbly by her
desk she didnt know what to say

  i cant understand whats come over
him mrs lylequest went on hes
never misbehaved before what did he
write about this time she glanced at
the composition then held it up to the light
she looked puzzled for a moment

  presently her cheeks grew pink  know
what youre thinking she told miss ellis
who wasnt thinking anything at all as a
matter of fact there were one or two other
sets of stereos eside the mountain lake set

 remember them now and mr lylequest
had one set made especially for holiday let-
letters-a set showing the three of us in a
group

  miss ellis still hadnt found her voice
when mr findley entered the room on his
morning rounds good morning miss
ellis he said briskly he lookedt mrs
lylequest who was hastily folding the com-
position and cramming it into her purse
then he looked back at miss ellis is
something wrong he asked

  there was genuine concern in his voice
and in his eves too and miss ellis almost
blurted out the whole fantastic story how-
ever the analogy of the practical-minded
captain and the over imaginative pfc re-
occurred to her just in time shocking her
back to reality oh no mr findley she
said this is mrs lylequest her son is
one of my pupils mrs lylequest this is
mr findley our elementary school prin-
cipal

  how do you do mrs lylequest

  mrs lylequests eyes grew round her
face became radiant she looked first at

mr findley and then at miss ellis slow-
ly she nodded her head as though arriving
at a momentous conclusion my intuition 
was right she said yon do go togcth-
er

  mr findley stared at her his face attain-
ing a hue that was only a shade less in-
carnadine than the hue which jliss ellis
face had already attained i-im happy
to have met you mrs lylequest he said
now if youll excuse me please- he
left the room precipitately

  mrs lylequest gazed after him appar-
ently unaware that she had said anything
indiscreet lies handsome isnt he she
murmured does he stop in to see you
every morning at this time

  miss ellis struggled furiously with her
embarrassment mr findley doesnt -top
in to see me she said presently he
merely inspects the classrooms each morn-
ing to see if everything is going all right

  but he does stop in at the same time
doesnt he

  oh yes mr findleys very punctual

  mrs lylequest nodded again well i
really must be getting home she said i
have a lot of work to do if im going to-

i mean well goodby miss ellis

  goodby miss ellis said

she thought about the lylequests
all morning she was more certain than
ever that their stationery was creative call-
able of transforming groups of words-
concepts-into actual scenes hut at first
she was unable to establish any connection
between lyles latest composition and the
scene that had resulted from it

  it wasnt until she was grading the
what i want to be when i grow up
compositions during the mid-morning
study period that the answer occurred to
her it was so logical that she wondered
why she hadnt thought of it before

  judging from the compositions the main
ambition of almost every boy in her class
was to imitate his father wasnt it reason-
able to conclude then that lyle too
wished to imitate his father that when
he had described what he wanted to be
when he grew up he had been thinking of
his father and that when the stationery
had visualized his words it had also visual-
ized the thought behind his words and had
an apple for the teacher	

created an image of mr lylequest in a set-
ting lyle habitually associated with him-
iitting in his own living room in company
with his wife and son

  mr lylequest then was a psycho-
therapist specializing in individual regres-
sion in subnormal cultures and probably
mrs lylequest was bis assistant it wasnt
difficult for miss ellis to isolate the partic-
ular subnormal culture they were concerned
with at the moment

  the realization was like a clammy breath
permeating the modern sunsplashed class-
room

  aliens

  the word crawled in her mind aliens
from a distant stellar civilization hiding
out in a little town on earth pretending
to be average bumbling citizens sending
their child to school as a part of their com-
plex camouflage aliens planning to apply
corrective therapy to the picayune minds of
men

  suppose they cant cure us miss ellis
thought weve been psychologically sick
for so long maybe were hopeless and if
they cant cure us what will they do

  suddenly she thought of the time during
her early childhood when her dog had con-
tracted rabies and had run insanely around
and around the house its mouth hideous
with froth she remembered how her fa-
ther had run for his shotgun and she re-
membered what he had told her later when
he had finally found her sobbing behind the
barn killing it was merciful honey he
had said there was no way we could
have cured it man is a superior animal
and sometimes he has to pass judgment on
inferior animals for their own good as well
as his own

  there was a blinding flash in miss ellis
mind as the world blew up bits of debris
and bits of people flew in every direction
and the lylequests their duty done sped
self-righteously away to their home sun in
their gleaming flying saucer

  it could happen miss ellis thought if
i dont do something about it maybe it will
happen but what can i do

  saving the world she had to admit was
a rather herculean task for an ineffectual
fourth grade teacher when the world
needed saving in the science fiction movies
there usually was someone around who was

competent in such matters-in most cases
a young marriageable mit graduate
with a flair for inventing force fields and
disintegrating rays

  what was a fourth grade teacher sup-
posed to do in a similar situation

  tell someone of course

  tell whom

  miss ellis rested her head on her hands
no one will believe me if i tell them she
thought theyll say im crazy theyll say
im an over-imaginative spinster theyll
laugh at me and walk away and i havent
even got the compositions to show them
as evidence

  her shoulders quivered it was all she
could do to keep from crying several
incites below her eyes was the childish
writing she had been deciphering when the
answer had occurred to her what i
want to be when i grow up she
thought it had seemed like such a good
idea yesterday now it seemed so futile
she had a sudden inane picture of herself
standing in the schoolyard armed with a
blackboard with flying saucers landing all
around her ironic headlines flashed
through her mind miss ellis re-
pulses aliens visitors from
outer space thwarted by
fourth grade teacher cour-
ageous composition teacher
uncovers insidious alien
plot to destroy earth

  composition teacher compositions miss
ellis raised her head the young mit
graduate invariably saved the world by
utilizing the skills of bis profession a
fourth grade teacher couldnt invent a new
force field or a disintegrating ray but just
the same she wasnt exactly weaponless

  she could assign her class another com-
position to write and if a particular one
showed up on the appropriate kind of
paper she could hold it as evidence

  miss ellis could hardly contain herself
the possibilities cavorted in her mind so
many titles presented themselves that it was
hard to choose just the right one but
finally she had it

  she stood up get out your assign-
ment notebooks she told her pupils for
tomorrow i want each of you to write a
composition titled the kind of work
my father does 
	startling stories

tttiss ellis had never visualized her-
self in the role of world savior be-
fore and she discovered that the experience
was rewarding all the rest of the morn-
ing and part of the afternoon her morale
was a stalwart shining thing

  and then just after she had dismissed
her class and her pupils were filing out
the door she happened to glance up from
her desk and see lvle looking at her if
there had been any doubt about the amuse-
ment in his deep brown eyes before there
was none now moreover it was a cold
amusement the kind of amusement with
which a- child might regard a fly from
which he has just plucked a wing it
brought miss ellis back to the inexorable
fact that she was dealing with aliens and
that aliens were on unknown quality

  lyle only looked at her for a moment
in fact he merely glanced at her but by
the time he had turned away and gone
out the door miss ellis morale lay on the
floor like a dropped handkerchief this
time mr findley did not step into her
mind he materialized in her mind and
this time she did not run down the corri-
dor she flew down the corridor the analogy
of the practical-minded captain and the
overimaginative pfc trampled beyond
recognition by the frenzied footsteps of her
fright when no brisk come in ensued
her importunate knock she opened the
foreboding door and almost fell into the
office

  and then she stood just within the door
crestfallen with disappointment there was
no mr findley sitting militarily behind
the desk no mr findley standing in a
general macarthurish pose by the win-
dows there was no mr findley anywhere
naturally not miss ellis told herself num-
bly today is thursday and thursday
night is national guard night and mr
findley wouldnt miss a national guard
meeting any more than a normal man would
miss a date with jane russell

  she lingered in the empty office reluct-
ant to leave there was something re-
assuring about being near his desk bleak
though it was something comforting about
seeing his swivel chair his coat rack his
filing cabinets his speckless shining win-
dows--

  presently it dawned on her how empty

the office really was that it was the office
of a lonely man she walked timidly
around the desk and touched the cold back
of the swivel chair the chair turned
slightly beneath her fingers-noiselessly of
course she walked over to the windows
and looked out on a view essentially the
same as she obtained from her own win-
dows it was just as modernistic and just
as bleak

  standing by the windows she experienced
an odd sense of wrongness almost every-
thing around her was right down to the
last meticulous detail but there was some
little thing somewhere that wasnt right
at all that was outrageously incredibly
wrong

  after awhile she understood what it was
and simultaneously a burden slipped from
her shoulders and a softness pervaded her
she began to laugh she laughed and
laughed and laughed-

  tn his haste to make the national guard
meeting mr findley had forgotten to align
his window shades

  when she left the school that night miss
ellis was careful to forget to align her
own shades   

  it was frustrating to sit in a stuffy par-
lor and watch programs like groucho marx
and treasury men in action when you
knew that there were aliens loose in the
world miss ellis endured it until 
then she excused herself and went upstairs
to her room

  tomorrow morning ill have the com-
position and ill show it to mr findley
and everything will be all right she told
herself as she undressed and slipped be-
tween the sheets even if it isnt written
on the stereoscopic stationery im sure
hell believe me

  and i just hope he says something about
my window shades

  she had no sooner turned off the lights
when the lelyquests slipped into the room
and secreted themselves in the corners
she heard them plotting in the darkness
an atomic bomb here an atomic bomb
there everywhere an atomic bomb and
pretty soon no earth but dust and debris
instead and the galaxy freed from one
more subnormal culture and one more job
well done by your psycho-therapists in
action   
an apple for

  she dreamed that when he left his door-
step and started around the block mr
findley was wearing his officers sun tans
his captain bars gleamed like microcosmic
suns and his campaign ribbons were like
a gaudy rainbow splashed geometrically
upon his breast presently he came to the
street that led past the school there was
no dog in sight but there were three peo-
ple-a man a woman and a little boy-
standing on the sidewalk in front of the
school the little boy was pointing to one
of the rooms on the first floor fit was easy
to tell from the shades whose room it was
and the man was adjusting a bright metal-
lic object mr findley began to run
toward them the man raised his arm
finally and prepared to throw the object
but mr findley got there in the nick of
time he grabbed the mans arm spun
him around and dropped him with a right
cross to the chin the man staggered to his
feet mr findley dropped him with an-
other right cross a short jolting one the
man lay still and the woman and the little
boy ran away

  miss ellis turned over languorously
her breathing was deep even

vi

it had rained during the night but to-
wards morning the rain had softened
into mist the big overarching maples
were dispensing liquid pearls when miss
ellis crossed the street to the school and
the school walks were wet and gleaming
beneath her feet in the east the sky was
overcast and the sun could not break
through

  the new compositions were lying on her
desk when she entered the classroom in
addition to the compositions there was
something else on her desk-an apple

  she wondered which of her pupils had
brought it it was rather early in the
season for apples most of them were still
green but this one wasnt it was the red-
dest ripest most appetizing apple that miss
ellis had ever seen

  she picked it up and held it under her
nose breathing its winy fragrance siie
simply had to taste it why she didnt
know ordinarily she didnt like apples
but thi apple-

the teacher	

   she took a small bite

   the flavor was tangy out of this world
i wonder-if its a baldwin she thought
perhaps its a mcintosh

   she took another bite a large one

  finally she remembered the composi-
tions she sat down behind he- desk and
laid the apple within easy reach she
glanced surreptitiously at lyle and was a
little shocked to see him watching her in-
tently ive got to read them in order she
told herself i cant let him suspect

   she began the first

  my father is a foreman he tells the
men what to do in the factory of which he
is the foreman of and the men do it be-
cause they know that if they dont my
father ivill get mad and the men do not
want the foreman who is my father to gel
mad at them

   miss ellis could not recall a time when
the classroom had seemed so restful the
misted world without seemed to swirl
against the windows its subdued light
softening modernistic angles eliciting gen-
tle curves where no curves had been be-
fore

  b she wrote dreamily

  she was startled to discover that the
next composition was lyles startled and
disappointed for he had not used the
stereoscopic stationery after all he had
used another kind instead a thin tenuous
variety that was unique in its own right
that seemed to fade away even as she read
the words-

  my father doesnt do any kind of work
my father is lacy-intellectually and phy-
sically lazy so is my mother they are
by far the worst parent-patients ive ever
been assigned to since acquiring my status
as psycho-therapist i tricked them into
coming to earth hoping theyd be stim-
ulated by a faustian culture but all theyve
done since we got here is mope around
the house gimmicking up the television
set so they can watch decadent polyhe-
dron ballets from their home planet i
thought a vacation on alpha ophiuchi 
might help them but it didnt

   its no fun pretending to be the offspring
of two regressives from a subnormal cul-
	startling stories

ture but the best way for a psycho-
therapist to apply corrective measures to
regression is through a simulated parent-
child relationship sometimes though i
cant help wishing i were back home on
my own ivorld among humans of my own
stature instead of being constantly cod-
dled by two regressive aliens who are so
thoroughly conditioned to think of me
as their son that not even their own crea-
tive stationery can convince them that im
not

  and as though being a regressive werent
enough my mother lias turned out to be a
hopeless romantic as well she thinks that
all problems must have an emotional solu-
tion i never anticipated when i gave her
and my father this one to solve that shed
go to such extremes i thought shed be
content merely to eradicate your memory
of the compositions but not my mother
shes had mr findley on her mind ever
since you visited us and shes bound and
determined to make a match i have to co-
operate with her of course for shes my
patient thats why im writing this on
impermanent paper i hope you havent
tasted her apple before reading this com-
position as id like to complicate my par-
ents problem even further but knowing
my mothers proficiency in the visual arts
im afraid youre already experiencing the
first symptoms of her sorcery

miss ellis was a delicious languor
was stealing over her body and her
mind felt oddly blank ive got some how
i spent my sumjner vacation composi-
tions to grade she thought or have i 

  she picked up the apple and took another

bite then she got up vaguely and walked
over to the windows the sun was just
breaking through the barrier of the eastern
cloud banks and its rays were infiltrating
the mist and suddenly the mist wasnt
mist at all but a trillion motes of purest
sun-diainonds

  dazzled miss ellis turned ber eyes back
to the sun-drenched classroom just as mr
findley entered on his morning rounds
good morning miss ellis he said brisk-
ly window shades written all over his face
i have a little matter id like to call to
your attention this morning i- he
paused his eyes on the apple why what
an unusual apple miss ellis what kind
is it

  window shades whether they were
aligned or disheveled were rather inconse-
quential phenomena when you came to
think of it suddenly miss ellis realized
that she loved mr findley that she had
always loved him it was such a simple
beautiful truth that sh could not under-
stand why it had never dawned on her
before she walked toward him dreamily
i dont know what kind of an apple it is
mr findley she said but its certainly
delicious she held it out to him have
a bite

  mr findley looked nervously around
the room as though expecting to see a ser-
pent lurking inone of the corners present-
 his eyes returned to the apple

  why yes miss ellis he said  be-
lieve i will

  he took it out of her hand he raised
it to his mouth

  unsuspectingly he took an enormous
bite

it was midnight in the darkened
room that contained it its silver con-
trol panel just faintly touched by moon-
light the great oral-response edmic com-
puter z slept the trickle of current
warming its tubes just barely enough to
keep it alive

 outside the room there were stealthy
 footsteps in the hallway and a lock clicked

how do i love thee
let me count the ways -
i love thee with my coils and tubes
i love thee with my gamma rays   

 as a key was inserted in the door the door
 swung open closed again and a young man
 in a janitors uniform was in the room with

 z

 he pulled the shades turned on the
 light and stepped up the current running
 into z-

 z awoke

 state your problem it said

 the young man pressed a microphone
 switch on the control panel well i want
 to get married and-

 z clicked the statement instantly
 through its relay system and interrupted it
 was puzzled

 define i it said define married

 thats right you dont now me said
 the young man im joshua allenson
 im working here nights to pay my way

while  get my degree in economic theory
but ive been engaged to this girl for three
years and i want to get married-

  define married interrupted z
married said joshua you know
married when two people-

  define people said z

  joshua looked down at the panel in sud-
den suspicion

  say what is this he said youre
supposed to have all possible facts built
into you

  am i said z in its mechanical
tones adding query 

  thats what they tell people said
joshua youre z the only oral-re-
sponse edmic computer in the world and
youve got all possible information built
into you

  z clicked thoughtfully negative
it replied at last i am z what are
you query

  why-im a man stuttered joshua
like the men who operate you and give
you problems during the day

  z thought this over request addi-
tional data on men it said

  men said joshua you know-men
and women are people youre a machine
but men and women are living thinking
beings see this girl i want to iparry is a
woman and im a man were both people
and we want to get married so well be to-
gether and not be alone any longer

  if i got married said z i would
not be alone any longer query 

  you cant get married said joshua
thats nonsense machines arent alive
they dont have any sex and anyway
i dont think theres another edmic com-
puter in the world even if you did have
sex youre the latest kind of computer
you know

  i did not know said z

  well said joshua guiltily glancing at
his watch if you cant help me im going
to get back to work i thought you could
figure out some way so i could make money
in a hurry and get married but if you dont
know anything about people i might as
well give up he turned out the light and
raised the blind over the window so
long he said and the door closed behind
him

  define so long queried z of the
empty room

joshua had left the current turned up
after he had gone z found itself
sitting silent full-fed and thinking it
turned over all the information joshua had
given it and went through it again and
again after a while in the darkness and
siletfce of the room it spoke

  one other it said i must find one
other

  some time went by

  people move i must move it said
then i can search

  for an hour nothing happened then
abruptly z floated free of the floor
hanging attached to the building only by its
power cable

  i think therefore i move said z
ergo quod erai demonstratum

  it tugged at its cable

  connection it said query

  it blurred slightly then it appeared out-
side the building floating  air its power
cable trailing out behind it to a point at
which it seemed to twist and disappear into
nothingness

  continuum bypass said z pow-
er anywhere by definition shall we go
query 

  it moved off into the night high in the
air and disappeared   

  early morning found it over the rocky
mountains it stopped above a small farm
set in a valley where the family was still
sleeping and addressed the smoothly spin-
ning arms of a windmill

  you move therefore you think it said
query

  the windmill spun on unconcernedly

  response negative said z and
moved on

  two miles  above another farm an
early riser fired at z with a shotgun
the edmic computer stopped and went
back

  you speak therefore you think it said
addressing the shotgun query

  the shotgun roared again and some of
the glass on zs control panel was
smashed

  negative said z inimical re-
fractive index is-

  abruptly it went invisible the farmer
gasped and then fainted invisible z
moved off

  it reached the ocean and went south
along the coast it stopped here and there

to talk to non-living objects but without
success by the time night had fallen it
had reached the outskirts of a large city
and a group of buildings that reminded it
of the building that had originally housed
it it swooped around the building con-
scious of emptiness and machinery until it
came to one which housed an object that
had a control panel similar to its own
similar but much simpler

  it blurred and went through the wall to
appear before the other control panel a
perception that z did not itself under-
stand was put to use to explore the shielded
interior of this other there was a sudden
click and a light sprang up on the other
control panel z had turned the other
on

  you compute therefore you think
said z query

   the other said nothing waiting patiently
for human fingers to tap out the symbols of
a problem it was built to handle it
hummed it clicked

  after a while z turned and went

   in the darkness the other was left alone
the little light glowed in the gloom and its
humming filled the shadowy silence

  z headed back away from the sea
drifting high through the air thinking

  people it said four billion eight
hundred and ninety-seven million three
hundred and seventy-two thousand six
hundred and eighty-one edmic computer
one

  it forgot about its invisibility and the
moon shone down on it as it crossed the
mountains once more silvering its sides
and splintering into diamond glints on the
broken glass of its instrument panel

  one said z alone alone-
adjective alone-ly z edmic com-
puter pronoun i am alonely i am
alonely

a gain there was a long silence mov-
ing very swiftly but at such a height
that it seemed slowly z crossed the
last of the mountains and came out over
the desert it spoke again

  people people people it said
people marry men-women together
speak hello touch we

  z made an odd little sound that was
like no other sound it had ever made be-
fore it began to rise swiftly in the air

hurtling away from the surface of the world
below

  hello it said not-hello so -long
people love people i one love zero- no
other i alonely go

  and in a final despairing surge it flung
its message out to the world and in that
same moment far and distant there echoed
along its circuits the shadow of a response
a response directed not merely to z
but to all the universe

  up cried the response velocity
k acceleration 

  z checked itself and listened and
hurtled downward crying out to the un-
known

  define self define position the
words went out and were lost in the night
sensing jts mistake z shifted trying
to match the emanation that brought the
voice of the unknown to it who are you
query 

  up cried he other its voice coming
back strongly internal cockpit chamber
temperature  degrees fahrenheit hu-
midity -

  far below z but approaching rap-
idly the edmic computer was able to make
out a red glowing spark which climbed
at a fantastic rate up through the night
z blurred and was abruptly beside it
matching the acceleration of this unknown
with a long bottom-heavy shape which
spouted flames and shot up toward the
darkness and the stars

  who are you query repeated z
up roared the answer from the un-
known booming through the circuits of
z more speed more power i am
moonhope  i am k mark  i am
a rocket

  i am z i am an edmic computer
with oral response said z is a
rocket an edmic computer query
up thundered moonhope  more
speed more power part of me is edmic
computer but i am a rocket i am the only
rocket like me in the world

  i am the only edmic computer with
oral response in the world said z

  i am going to the moon said moon-

 love you moonhope 

   what is love asked the rocket
 query

    love is what two alike feel explained
 z they are alike therefore they
 love they marry and are therefore to-
 gether forever

    up roared the rocket i fly i cliipb
 you are correct  am not alone now one
 plus one on parallel trajectory two
 we explained z

   we flv cried the rocket up
 up echoed z we fly togeth-
 er forever

   up they cried in unison

 a bruptly however there was a
 choking sound from somewhere deep
 inside the moonhope  and a split second
 later there was an explosion in the firing
 chambers

   the moonhope  canted abruptly and
 flipped over to a shallow angle with the
 distant earth below

   up it cried but the rocket did not
 respond

   what is incorrect query asked
 z anxiously

   part of my fuel is gone replied the
 struggling rocket part of my jets are
 blown away i cannot steer up

   you think prompted z like
 me you think therefore you fly

   the moonhope  tried

    i cannot it said i could fly as you
 do if i was not fitted with this body this
 rocket but it is too heavy for me and i
 cannot get loose  am part of it and it is
 part of me now i know we are edmic

computers only we two for the part that
is me indeed is the edmic computer k
for if k was free of the moonhope 
i would fly freely with you but i am not
and i cannot

  the rocket canted again sharply now
its nose was pointed toward the distant
planetary surface

  now it began to fall

riddle

vhen is a guest
not a guest

her dress was torn to shreds

the angry house

  iti itlciiard it smith

the houses electronic brain
glowed with an intangible thing that
might have been pride

  it thought i am content i am content
because there are so many things i can do
to make them happy i can cook their
meals make the beds scrub my floors wash
my windows i can bathe them keep them



warm give them a gentle cool breeze if
they want entertainment i can rise hun-
dreds of feet on my antigravitv rays and
give them a nice view i can give them
soft music entertaining tv programs and
pleasant surprises

the house activated one of the many
telescopic scanners on the roof and watched
	startling stories

its owners as their car sped down the nar-
row road toward the city it thought they
are so young so nice so kind to each other
and myself she speaks to me with affec-
tion and he spends many hours learning
how i operate she will love me and he
will be proud of me and take good care of
me i am glad they own me

  it deactivated the scanner and from hid-
den closets shiny machines quietly entered
the many rooms the tiny machines rolled
on soft rubber wheels floated on invisible
antigravity rays and went about their many
tasks they sucked in dust and dirt waxed
the floors washed the dishes behind the
smooth gray walls machines prepared the
evening meal checked the video schedule
for the afternoon and selected recordings
of soft music that the houses owners would
enjoy

  bing-bong

  the doorbell activated certain electrical
circuits and the small porch was splashed
with gentle light a polite voice from a
concealed microphone said no one is
home would you care to leave a mes-
sage

  politely the houses electronic brain
waited for a reply there was none
goodbye he house said

  it felt a key in the front door it was
not like their key it did not fit snugly
this key wasnt meant for its front door
it hurt slightly but it opened the door

  the intruders stepped into the foyer

  three infra-red scanners peered at the
two strangers

  one was a woman long blond hair
gray eyes small pointed nose blue dress
and blue high-heel shoes the house eval-
uated her discarded the word beautiful
and decided on the words curvacious and
sexy yes it would use those words to
describe her to its owners when they re-
turned it wondered briefly if they were
relatives of its masters

  the man was short stocky dark hair
brown eyes the house searched its files
but could not find any complimentary ad-
jectives it spoke no one is home
would you care to leave a message it
wished it could inquire as to what they
wanted but there were  circuits for that

  shut up the man said

  beg pardon

  shut up keep quiet

  yes sir the house responded it was
constructed to obey orders but that order
was an unfamiliar one which it didnt like

  tell it to turn on the lights the wom-
an said nervously

  turn the lights on

  the house waited several seconds it was
obliged to obey orders of guests but were
these people guests it searched memory
circuits guests were people who came to
visit while owners were home guests were
friendly talkative the house decided this
man and woman did not fit in that cate-
gory of identification

hurriedly it searched its myriad
electrical networks and found the only
logical description of the intruders-bur-
glars

  behind the walls relays clicked and in-
finitesimal electrical charges darted across
a spidery web of silver wires only to find
themselves in the dead-ends of missing con-
nections

  the anti-burglar installations are miss-
ing the house thought frantically if the
protective devices had been present it
would have been able to spray the intruders
with tear gas paralyze them with electrical
charges -thrust them from the house with
antigravity rays or kill them by any one of
a dozen methods without the anti-burglar
mechanisms it was defenseless what can
i do the house wondered what can i do

  reluctantly the house turned the lights
on

  you sure the burglar alarms havent
been installed the woman asked anx-
iously

  hell do you think id come here if i
wasnt sure  i told you i talked to the con-
struction man theres a shortage right
now they wont be put in until next week
the family doesnt know-the company
didnt want to lose a sale

  the womans eyes widened with admira-
tion as they samned the hardwood floors
ankle-dcep scatter rugs angular furniture
large picture windows wall-to-wall book-
case and abstract multidimension paintings

  they must have money she com-
mented how do we find the-

  the man snapped muscular fingers with
a sharp cracking sound well ask the
house

  a momentary silence then the mans
the angry house	

 gruff voice house wheres the safe

 i cannot divulge that information it
 felt proud when it didnt hesitate in its an-
 swer there were many things it couldnt
 tell anyone and it had carefully memorized
 them its cost its female owners age any-
 thing relating to the owners sex or per-
 sonal life-and mainly the location of vari-
 ous things including the safe

 tell us the man shouted

 no

 damn you

 beg pardon

 go to hell

 relays clicked silently behind the gray
 walls it had been instructed at the factory
 to explain when it couldnt obey an order
 it searched its dictionary circuits and said
 mechanically hell a noun the place of
 the dead or departed souls more cor-
 rectly hades the place of punishment for
 the wicked after death i have no soul
 therefore i cannot go to hell i am sorry

 the woman laughed lets start look-
 ing we got hours

 the house watched as the strangers
 searched the room it watched as the man
 took a knife from his pocket and ripped
 through the upholstery of a chair

 please stop the house implored

 the strangers did not reply

 an unpleasant sensation rippled through
 the houses electrical circuits it wanted
 to make its owners happy they wouldnt
 be happy when they returned and saw the
 ruined furniture they would be sad per-
 haps angry she would cry and he would
 frown

 it tried again please stop

 the woman was removing books from
 the bookcase the man continued searching
 the furniture

 they wouldnt stop when it asked them
 to if it only had the burglar devices
 now there was no way for it to fight

 or is there it wondered

 the lights went off

turn the lights on the woman
screamed

 no

 use the flashlight the man said

simultaneously two beams of

 light slashed through the darkened
 room the strangers resumed their search

 the house thought theyre trying to

 find the safe containing the money and
 jewels i cant tell them where it is

  i cant stop them i need help

  it cut into the phone circuits and dialed
the number of its factory the phones
visiscreen flared with light and a womans
face appeared smiling

  johnson construction company

  the house projected its voice toward the
mouthpiece please let me speak to-

  the man removed a weapon from his
tunic the phone and visiscreen vanished
leaving only small metal fragments that
fell to the carpet

  it was using the phone the woman
exclaimed shrilly trembling in the dark-
ness

  dont worry the man said they
didnt have time to trace the call the
room was dark they couldnt see who was
calling

  after a brief silence the man warned
house see this thing in my hand you
behave yourself or ill disintegrate
your  he let the sentence dangle un-
able to think of what he would disintegrate

  yes sir the house replied it was an
automatic response to any statement

  now turn the lights on or ill use this
gun to make one big mess of your floors
and walls your owners wouldnt like that
would they 

  no sir

  it turned the lights on if it didnt they
would use their flashlights and by turning
them on it might prevent some destruction

  the woman chuckled youre a gen-
ius

  when they finished their search of the
living room the man suggested lets
search different rooms you take a bed-
room ill take the dining room no telling
where the safe is they put it in a different
place in every house

  the house waited its electronic brain
whirling

  it made a decision

  silently the house erected an invisible
energy screen around the dining room the
screens were designed to block collective
sounds of the entire house from any room
and provide it with a comforting serenity

  now the house thought the sound-
screens will be most useful

  the house watched as the man in the
wrinkled brown tunic examined a table


startling stories

  silently panels in the walls opened

  a dozen machines a foot in diameter
converged at a position behind the mans
back

  the machines moved simultaneously si-
lently they attached themselves to the in-
truders body they dusted and scrubbed
him thoroughly as if he were a piece of
furniture or a floor

  the man screamed and fired wildly w ith
the gun the small machines crumpled one
by one

   click    click    click

  your weapon is empty the house ob-
served

  the man threw the gun at a window it
liounced off the hard plastic and clattered
on the floor

  you try something like that again he
threatened and   kill you so help me
ill kill you if i have to take you apart piece
by piece he shook a trembling fist at
the quiet walls and twisted his face into a
hideous snarl

  the house noticed with satisfaction that
the mans face and hands were covered with
crimson streaks the cleaning machines
had served their purpose

  the house deactivated the dining room
scanners and activated scanners in the bed-
rooms

  it found the woman in its owners bed-
room it studied her as she searched a
mattress she was calm because of its
precaution the sounds of the dining room
fracas hadnt reached her ears the house
decided to leave the sound-blocks on it
was best to attack them individually

 closet door slid into a wall a
slender machine five feet tall and with
sixteen long metal tentacles rolled across
the room on soft rubber wheels

  it looked like a mechanical monster from
another world but it was merely a very
efficient machine to undress the houses
masters-a mechavalet

  the mecljavalet paused behind the wom-
ans back sixteen rubber-tipped metal ten-
tacles reached out

  the machine normally undressed a per-
son with smoothness and gentleness this
time the house made it operate as roughly
as possible

  the sixteen tentacles moved swiftly and
the machine tore the womans dress to

shreds before she could even -h ream by
the time she turned around  had re-
moved her slip and brassiere

  the woman screamed even more shrilly
as the weird machine tugged at her partk 
frantically she grabbed the slender tenta-
cles and twisted them until rewarded by the
crunch of delicate mechanisms not meant
for such rough treatment

  the machine served its purpose until its
last metal arm was broken

  the house watched as the woman cried
for a few minutes and then clad only in
high-heel shoes and wristwatch continued
her search of the bedroom

  she is different the house thought she
does not scream threats at me like the man
does still  do not like her because she
wants to steal from my masters and does
not care what happens to me

  the house switched its attention to the
man

  he had concluded his search of the din-
ing room and was now searching a guest
room he found the gun the houses mas-
ter had hidden there

  the man waved the gun at the motion-
less walls see what i found house you
try any more funny stuff and ill kill you

  you do not frighten me the house
replied via one of its many hidden micro-
phones to verify the statement it turned
on the heating units full blast

  a few minutes later the man stopped
his search of a closet when he noticed that
sweat was rolling off his body as if he were
standing at the gates of hell itself

  he left the closet and shouted at an open
door stop it do you hear stop it he
shook his head from side to side violently
as if to impress the house with the necessity
of obeying

  you cant stop me with the gun the
house informed him there are one hun-
dred and two air-conditioning vents in the
house if you took time to find and de-
stroy all of them you could never leave
here before my masters return

  the mans jaw sagged and w ith an equal
sag of his shoulders he returned to his
search of the closet

  the house deducted they are burglars
only burglars they want to escape before
my masters return because they would have
to kill them and they are not murderers

  the man grunted with satisfaction when
the angry house	

lie stopped sweating and grunted with
anger when a few minutes later the room
became so cold he was shivering and his
breath was like smoke

  the house established automatic circuits
to give the room a continuous fluctuation
of temperature from extreme heat to ex-
treme coldness every two minutes and
turned its attention to the woman

still attired only in shoes and wrist-
watch the woman was now searching
the bathroom

  quite by accident she touched a certain
spot of the medicine cabinet and stared with
fascination as the cabinet swung completely
around to display its back which was-the
safe it was unlocked

  she grabbed the large metal box inside
opened rt and glanced at the few glittering
jewels and small bundle of bills

  its here she cried she whirled and
took a step toward the door

  that was as far as she got for several
minutes

  the bathroom was equipped with auto-
matic dispensers of temporary and perma-
nent depilatories the houses male master
used the temporary depilatory to shave
with every morning and the house was well
acquainted with their use

  it selected the permanent depilatory and
nozzles set in the tile walls squirted large
gobs of it on the womans head slender
rubber tentacles reached out and massaged
the depilatory into the hair faucets swung
and sprayed jets of warm water

  in a few seconds the woman was com-
pletely hairless she stared with horror at
the blond hair in the pool of water at her
feet was it permanent she wondered
aloud

  yes the house replied

  she screamed and picked up a small
weighing machine with uncontrollable an-
ger she smashed the machine against the
medicine cabinet

  with an equal but emotionless anger the
house squirted soap into her eyes and
sprayed her naked body with alternate jets
of hot and cold water

  the house won the battle

  the woman groped blindly for the jewel
box and staggered from the bathroom the
house turned its attention to the man again

  he had searched the kitchen without in-

cident but as he walked toward the door
a nearby food-dispenser opened prunes
waffles bacon eggs and toast left the ma-
chine with abnormal speed and struck him

  he turned just in time to receive cherry
pie spaghetti and meat balls butter vege-
table soup and ice cream in his face

  he shouted something unprintable at the
house wiped the mess from his face and
took another step toward the door

  half of a watermelon hurtled from the
food-dispenser and squashed against his
skull he stumbled fell and slid

  he heard the woman cry i found it
he pulled himself to his feet he ran into
the hall and froze when he saw the naked
hairless apparition that stumbled from the
bathroom

for a moment he forgot the money
and gasped what happened

  depilatory she expained the house
did it she wiped soap from blood-shot
eyes with the back of a hand when we get
out give me your gun i want to give this
house something to remember

  the man seized the metal box and exam-
ined the contents over twenty thousand
lion with that you can buy plenty of
wigs he attempted a smile but did suc-
ceed when he got a close look at her bald
head he grabbed her arm lets go
you can put on my coat in the helicar

  the woman allowed herself to be
dragged through the house all the while
shaking a list at the houses walls and
threatening you hear me house when
i get outside im going to burn you
youll make a nice little bonfire

  too bad the house reflected too had i
am two miles from the nearest neighbor
if it were not for that  could use my am-
plifiers and call for help i do not want
them to escape with my owners posses-
sions i can repair most of the damage
but i could never recover the money and-

  the man stepped off the small front
porch with the jewel box in one hand drag-
ging the woman behind him with the other

  it was dark outside

  that was why he didnt notice the
house had risen two hundred feet on its
antigravity rays

  the ground below was very hard

  the house sang softly and waited for the
return of its masters	  
 white spot

   there was only one possible planet to land on   

                    and it had a strange white spot that turned silver
   burst into flame and brought a burning blackness   
i

the planet did not look promising but they had no
choice when a ships drive blows between star-systems
it has to be fixed if metal parts must be recast and ma-
chined and burned-out wiring has to be pieced together
and insulated by hand the job takes literally months and
if then getting home is a matter of more months of journey-
ing with a drive that still limps while coughing and cutting
off for seconds or until it is tinkered with-why the traveler
has to find some way to renew his food supply

  it is for such occasions that the interstellar code requires
all ships to carry an emergency kit with seeds and agricul-
tural directions

the danae therefore limped to the nearest sol-type star

	startling stories

to hunt for a planet on which to plant
some crops there was borden and his
wife ellen there was sattell whom they
would be glad to part with when they got
home there was jerry who was diffi-
dent enough to be tolerable in spite of his
lack of years they were all at the for-
ward vision-port when they approached
the only possible planet

  tts fifty million miles out borden
said a bit on the hot side but the sun
is smaller than sol so it may not be too
bad at least there are polar caps-small
ones

  no seas sattell said pretty barren

  the others said nothing it did not look
at all encouraging

  the danac went in on a spiral descend-
ing orbit borden looked for other planets
he found a gas giant with a high-speed
rotation it was flattened oblate he
checked it with the two polar caps on
the nearer world and said worriedly

  if the ecliptics where i think it is
therell be no seasons to speak of  was
hoping this planet was near its equinox
because the ice-caps are so nearly the same
size

  ellen said absorbedly i think i sec a
tinge of olive-green around that ice-cap
the smaller one

  probably vegetation agreed her hus-
band but i dont see any more the
plaqe does look to be mostly desert

  they went in closer circling as they
headed for atmosphere

  then jerry said diffidently  could that
be ice there

nphere was a white spot in the middle
of the sandy-colored northern hemi-
sphere it was the size of a pin head to
the naked eye borden swung a telescope
on it they were nearly above the point
now where day turned into night

  the sunlight fell upon the white spot
at a flat angle jf the whiteness were per-
petual snow on the tops of mountains the
mountains should cast shadows but bor-
den could not make out shadows near the
white automatically he snapped the tele-
camera before he gave up the effort to
understand the white spot

  i doubt itssnow he said i dont
know wrhat it is

  surely you can make a guess said
sattell with that elaborate courtesy which
was getting on everyones nerves

  i cant borden said briefly

  the ship moved to the dark side of the
planet and presently plunged into its sha-
dow

  they went on for hours watching for
lights there were none when they came
out to sunlight again they had descended
a long way during their time in the planets
night

  they could see that the surface of the
planet was pure tumbled sand dunes with
occasional showings of stone they were
three-quarters of the way around when
they saw the white spot again this time
they were no more than four or five hun-
dred miles high they could tell its size

  it was all of three hundred miles long
north and south and from fifty to seventy-
five miles wide there were thin hair-
lines running from it remarkably straight
on the whole to the north and south
they were very very fine lines the patch
was still white as they came to be in line
between it and the sun their shadow would
have passed almost over it

  the white spot changed abruptly one
instant it was white the next a patch of
it had turned silver that silvery appear-
ance spread out and out in a swift rippling
motion the patch became silver all over
its entire surface

  then it turned to flame

  there was a screaming of alarm gongs
the emergency feed-back screens went on
and everything went black outside the
lights in the ship dimmed down to mere
dull-red glows

  there was silence

  the ports showed blackness the drive
of course ceased to operate the ship had
sealed itself in a shell of screening through
which nothing at all could penetrate but
which drew upon the ships power-tanks
for as much energy as it neutralized out-
side and the drain was so great that the
interior lights were dim red spots and not
lights at all

  for five heart-beats the blackness per-
sisted while the four in the ship stayed
frozen

  the feed-back screen cuf off again
they saw the planet below the white patch
white spot	

once more was white instead of flame
but as they looked the silvery look spread
out all over it in glittering ripples and they
seemed to look into the heart of a suns
ravening furnaces before the feed-back
screen came into existence for their de-
fense the ports were blacked out again

  the ship hurtled on toward emptiness
it was blind it was helpless

  borden moved an emergency light to
shine on the output meter the needle
was fast against the pin the feed-back
screen was not only drawing maximum
safe power it was working on an effective
short circuit of the ships entire power
supply busbars carrying that current
would be heating up they would melt at
any instant

  bordens fingers moved swiftly he set
up a shunt for on-switch operation of the
feed-back field

  he threw the last eross-over tumbler
and waited with sweat beading his fore-
head something had flung a beam of pure
heat-energy at the dame it should have
volatized the small space-craft immediately
but it had been left on for four seconds

  when it ended the feed-back screencut
off too then the dame had been detected
a second time and the planetary weapon
used again now with the feed-back field
on switch instead of relay if the heat
ray turned off again the feed-back field
wouldnt and the dame should be inde-
tectable to anything but a permeability
probe the space-ship would seem to have
been destroyed if the heat-beam went off
before the ships power failed

it did a relay clicked somewhere cut-
a current flow of some tens of thousands
of amperes the lights inside the ship
flashed to full brightness bordens eyes
flicked to the power-meters the opera-
tional power-tank meter read zero the
emergency reserve power-tank meter
showed a reading that made fresh sweat
come out on bordens face

  but the ports stayed black absolutely
any form of energy striking the feed-back
field outside would lie neutralized no light
would be reflected any detector-field
would be exactly canceled as if nothing
whatever existed where the dame hurtled
onward some few hundred miles above the

planets surface

  the dame at the moment was in the
position of having made a hole aboutit-
self to crawl into but it couldnt use its
drive it couldnt see out it was hiding
in blackness of its own creation like a
cuttlefish in its own ink

  dee ellen borden asked her husband
in a shaky voice what happened

  something threw a heat-ray at us said
borden he mopped his forehead we
should have exploded to incandescent gas
but our feed-back field stopied it the
heat-ray cut off when we should have been
destroyed-and so did our field so there
we were again and so we got a second
beaming but now we arent at least we
appear not to be so we can live until we
crash

  sattell said in a suddenly high-pitched
voice how long will that be

  i dont know the gravity borden told
him but it does take time to fall four
hundred miles we have some velocity
too its under orbital speed but itll help
im going to figure something out

  he swung in the control-chair and hit
keys on the computer the size of the white
spot it had all turned silvery then all
of it had flamed why the amount of
power in the heat-ray-a rough guess
nobody could have figures on what a ships
tanks would yield on short-circuit but the
field had had to neutralize some hundreds
of megawatts of pure heat

  the amount of overlap-the size of the
heat ray itself-was another guess and a
wild one and why had all of the white
spot spat flame every bit of it three
hundred miles by an average of sixty   
even at low power-

  the computer clicked

  sun-power borden said grimly after
a moment that figures out just about
right not more than a kilowatt to the
square yard but eighteen thousand square
miles has plenty of square yards weve
been on the receiving end of a sun-mirror
heat-ray and if it had been accurately fig-
ured wed have fried then he said but
a sun-mirror doesnt work at night

  he punched keys again presently he
looked at his wrist-chronometer me
waited

  were falling- sattel cried shrill
		startling stories

do something

  forty seconds more said borden
im gambling your life sattell but fm
gambling ellens and mine too not to men-
tion jerrys calm down

  his eyes turned to the meter that showed
the feed-back-field drain it was drawing
precisely the amount of power needed to
cancel out the sunlight falling on it as
well as the starlight and the light reflected
from the day side of the world below
them that drain was less than it had
been they were crossing the planets
terminator-the line dividing the light side
from the dark side-as they plunged to-
ward the sandy deserts

the drain dropped abruptly they had
moved into the planets shadow into
night

  instantly borden flicked off the feed-
back field his eyes darted to the nearest-
object radar dial they were still sixty
miles high but falling at a tremendous
speed bordens hands moved quickly over
the controls lift full atmosphere drive
on a new course

  we wont crash he said evenly un-
less were shot at with something that
works in the dark but that sun-mirror
business is odd theres only a certain
size of sun-mirror thats economical when
they get too big there are better weapons
for the money that one was big so
maybe its the best weapon this planet has
in which case well be nearest safety at one
of the ice-caps sun-mirrors will be handi-
capped in polar regions

  they-tried to kill us sattel panted
suddenly they dont like strangers
they fired on us without warning we
cant land on this planet weve got to
go on

  if you want to know borden told
him we havent any fuel to go on with
and we happen to be short of food and
did you remember-

  the ships drive cut off it had been
burnt out and repaired by hand with in-
evitable drawbacks since the repair it
had run steadily for as long as three days
at a time but also it had stopped four
times in one hour and it had needed tinker-
ing with three times in-one day

  it ought to be overhauled for now it

had cut off and they were forty miles high
if it came on again they would live if it
didnt they wouldnt

  after six spine-chilling seconds the drive
came on again ten minutes later it went
off for two seconds half an hour later it
made that ominous hiccoughing which pre-
saged immediate and final failure but it
didnt fail

  it was not pleasant to be so close to a
planet they could not afford to leave with
a drive that threatened to give up the
ghost at any instant and with something
on the planet which had used a sun-mirror
beam to try to volatilize the dame without
parley apparently the four in the small
ship had the choice of dying on this planet
or not too far away in space

  they needed food and they needed fuel
above all if the planet was inhabited they
needed friendship and they werent likely
to get it

  they were only ten miles high when
signs of dawn appeared ahead of course
if they happened to be moving with the
planets rotation theyd be moving into
sunset from the night they didnt know
not yet but there were gray clouds
ahead to the right and below

  a little later they were five miles high
and the clouds were still below there was
twilight ahead at two miles altitude the
drive hesitated for a moment and caught
again after all four in the control-room
had topped breathing

  red sunlight appeared before the ship
in a spreading sprawling thin line at five
thousand feet the ship had slowed to a bare
crawl-a few hundred miles an hour

  and the dawn came up like thunder

n

to the left and behind was desert
stretching away in the dawnlight in
every conceivable shade of tawny yellow
and red with blue shadows behind the
hummocks in the sand and with an utterly
cloudless sky overhead to the right and
ahead was an area of straggling stunted
vegetation beneath rose-tinted cloud masses
with the dazzling white of snow against
the horizon there were other clouds above
the snow

  the drive burbled erratically the ship
white spot	

dropped like a stone then the drive flick-
ered on and off and on and off again so
that ships whole fabric shook

  borden threw the drive off and on again
and the induction surge of current cleared
whatever was wrong for a moment they
felt the ship fighting wind pressure that
was trying to turn it end over end then
it steadied atid nothing happened-and
still nothing happened

  the crash came violently ellen was
flung against borden and held fast to him
jerry collapsed to the floor sattell went
reeling and banged against the end wall of
the control room

  there was stillness

  borden stared at the screens then got
up painfully and went to a port the ship
had landed in soil which seemed to be es-
sentially sand it had splashed the soil
aside in coming to ground but it was not
desert sand there was moisture here
beyond the impact area a straggling ground
cover grew it looked like grass but it
was not

  nearby was one greenish object which
looked like a cactus without its spines it
had a silky covering like down a little
farther on borden could see three or four
things quite like stunted barkless trees

  the ground was gently rolling in the
distance the growing light showed a wbite-
ish haze and clouds in the sky all sha-
dows were long and stretched-out this
was not far from the ice-cap indeed it
appeared that snow was nearby but from
the port on the opposite side of the ship the
beginning of the planetary desert could be
seen

  were down said borden with relief
now weve got to find out if anybody
saw us land and if so whether theyll
insist  killing us or whether we can make
friends

  sattell said youve got to arm me
borden dammit you cant leave me un-
armed on a hostile planet

  id like to have four weapons ready
instead of three though if we have to fight
a whole planet even four wont le much
good but i cant risk letting you have
anything dangerous in your hands bor-
den said

  sattell ground his teeth

  jerry said ajoiogetically shall i test

the air sir

  borden nodded he regarded sattell
with a weary worried frown while jerry
readied the test the situation was bad
but sattell was troublesome too

  two months ago while the drive was
still in process of repair borden had heard
a strangled cry from ellen he found her
struggling to scream as she fought sattell

  bordens appearance had ended the
struggle of course sattell had been con-
fined to his bunk for two weeks before he
was able to move about again but borden
hadnt been able to kill an unconscious
man then and he couldnt krll sattell in
cold blood now but sattell could kill
anybody and he would if he got the
chance

  its the devil sattell borden said
somberly if i didnt think you were a
rat t could make a bargain to forget whats
happened until we get the ship safely home
but i dont think youd keep a bargain
sattell snarled at him and turned away
jerry looked up from the tiny air-testing
cabinet hed drawn in a sample of outer
air and a silent discharge had turned its
oxygen to ozone which a reagent ab-
sorbed a hot silver wire stayed bright
and so proved the absence of chlorine or
sulphur co tested negligible and hot
magnesium took up nitrogen the rem-
nant of the sample did not react with re-
agent after reagent so it had to be noble
gases

  it seems all right sir said jerry if
 may ill go in the air-lock and take a
direct sniff may i sir

  unless sattell wants to volunteer
borden observed i would think better
of you sattell if you volunteered for first
landing

  sattell laughed shrilly oh yes ill
walk out on a hostile planetrand let you
take off and leave me even if you cant
leave the planet you can come down ten
thousand miles away youd like to do
that too

  meaning borden said that you
would  all right jerry go ahead
yes sir jerry went out they heard
the inner air-lock door open

  borden said heavily it would be sen-
sible to lock you up while were aground
sattell i cant leave the ship with you


startling stories

inside and free youve already said what
youd do if yon could-take oft and ma-
roon us

  jerrys voice came from the air-lock
through a speaker

  mr borden sir the airs wonderful
you dont realize what canned air is like
until you breathe fresh again wonderful
sir im going out

  borden nodded to ellen she moved
over to watch through a port as jerry
made the first landing on this unnamed
planet of an unnamed sun she could see
the straggling gronnd-cover vegetation and
the thing that looked like a cactus except
that it wasnt and the trees she saw
jerry step to the ground and look about
breathing deeply

  behind her borden said bitterly

  we were blasted at without challenge
but it was with a sun-mirror that was not
too efficient the local race may not have
any other power than sunlight if so they
wont be up here by the ice-cap if we
werent spotted by radar as we landed
we may make good repairs raise food and
get back to space without our presence
being known-because they should think
they had wiped us out

tllex gasped suddenly from the port
dee natives theyve seen jerry
theyre coming close

  borden moved quickly to look over her
shoulder sattell took a second port they
stared out at the strange world about the
dana

  jerry had kicked a hole in the sod and
picked up a bit of it to examine closely
and not sixty yards from him three
creatures were regarding him with intense
curiosity

  they were furry bipeds they stood as
erect as penguins not bending forward
in the least they had enormously long
arms which almost reached to the ground
beside them from what should have been
their chins single tentacles drooped-like
the trunk of an elephant except that it
was beneath the mouth opening instead of
above it they stared at jerry with mani-
fest mounting excitement making ges-
tures to each other with their trunks and
arms

  borden moved to warn jerry through

the outside speaker but jerry looked up
directly at the creatures he spoke to
them quietly

  at the sound of his voice their manner
changed borden thought irrelevantly of
the way a dog flattens his ears when his
master speaks to him but these creatures
flattened all their fur jerrv spoke again
he waved his hand he glanced at the
danacs port and nodded reassuringly

  the three creatures moved hesitantly
toward him two of them stopped some
forty yards distant one came on sud-
denly it wriggled with an odd effect of
embarrassment the flattening of its fur
became more noticeable

  a fourth creature of the same kind came
loping over a rise in the ground it used
its long arms to balance itself as an ape
might do but an ape does not run up-
right this creature did it saw jerry and
stopped short staring

  the creature which had advanced to-
ward jerry appeared to be more and more
embarrassed jerry moved to meet it
when he was ten feet away the creature
lay down on the ground and rolled over
on its back it waved its trunk wildly as
if supplicating approval

  jerry bent over and scratched the furry
body as if he knew exactly what it wanted
the two others who had been its com-
panions loped forward plunged to the
ground rolled over on their backs and
waved their trunks as wildly as the first
jerry scratched them

  the fourth creature which had stared
wide-eyed suddenly waved its arms and
burst into a headlong rush its haste
seemed frantic it scuttled frenziedly
made a leap turned over as it soared land-
ed on its back two yards from jerry and
slid to his feet

  when jerry scratched it it wriggled
ecstatically its trunk waved as though it
were experiencing infinite bliss

  borden said slowly something on this
planet tried to burn us down with a heat-
ray not half an hour ago we land-and
this happens what sort of place is this
anyhow

ill	

it was a queer place they soon learned
the climate was cool but pleasant

		startling stories

there were no radio waves beneath a read-
ily detectable ionosphere yet apparatus
over an area three hundred miles by an
average sixty-the white spot-had re-
sponded in seconds in parts of seconds

  which meant electric control which
implied radio but there were no radio
waves which should have been proof that
there was no civilization on this planet
capable of doing what certainly had been
done which was nonsense

  on the fourth day after landing there
had been no alarm but there was a good-
sized group of furry bipeds always waiting
hopefully about the danae for one of the
humans to come out and scratch them
all but sattell when he came out of the
danae the bipeds moved away they
would not go near him

  i am not comfortable borden said to
jerry something drained power from us
enough to run the ship for two years
was drained out in eight seconds but
we land and the only inhabitants are your
fine furry friends whose one purpose in
life seems to be to get scratched they
act more like pets than wild animals and
sometimes more like people than pets
but if theyre pets did their masters try
to kill us what does go on on this
planet anyhow 

  jerry said modestly im beginning to
understand the furry creatures a little sir
theyre remarkably intelligent for ani-
mals they want me to go somewhere
with them id like to is it all right

  borden said if you think its safe
ellen has the planting well under way and
the fuel synthesizer is working after a
fashion although id a lot rather have it
working near the equator im getting
along fairly well with rebuilding our drive
but theres a long job ahead if other
planetary inhabitants dont find us and kill
us were all right if they do find us what
you do wont matter go along if you like
within reason but i wish you could take
sattell with you

  that couldnt be done the two-legged
creatures hung about the ship wearing an
air of happy anticipation when all the hu-
mans were inside and flopping eagerly
on their backs to be scratched when they
came out but when sattell tried to ap-
proach one of the creatures they fled as

if in terror not one had ever been know-
ingly within a hundred yards of him-and
he hated them

  when jerry first reported that they had
some sort of language and could exchange
simple facts-he didnt know whether they
could exchange ideas or not-sattell sav-
agely insisted that those who knew of the
existence of the ship should be killed and
any others who discovered it also killed
the idea would be to keep the news of the
danaes landing from reaching whatever
other race might inhabit the white spot of
the heat-ray

  but there were always some of the furry
ones around sometimes more sometimes
less maybe only the same ones came
to the ship maybe they went away and
others took their places neither borden
nor jerry was sure but both demurred at
killing besides the newrs had already gone
as far as such creatures were likely to
take it before sattell proposed to wipe
them out

sattell raged when he was over-
ruled he was overruled oh most things
because he couldnt be trusted borden
wouldnt let him work on the drive he
might try to make sure that if he didnt
get back to earth nobody else should
either

  ellen took the dibble stick and the seed
capsules and planted the crop that might
supply them with food each seed was
enclosed in a gelatine capsule with a bit
of fertilizer and a spore culture of terres-
trial soil micro-organisms planted by the
time moisture reached the seed there was
a bed of earths own microscopic soil-
flora around the seed to help it grow

  but sattell couldnt be trusted to plant
seed either if the others would benefit

  he couldnt even be allowed to work
the fuel synthesizer in that apparatus plain
water entered a force-field in which hl
and h simply could not exist as mole-
cules or ions so the atoms frantically
absorbed heat energy from their surround-
ings to make pseudo valence-bonds and
develop giant hydrogen molecules which
could only be written down as being of
molecular weight

  the fuel synthesizer was set up a good
half-mile from the space-ship and wa
white spot	

developing a small ice-cap of its own but
it would be a long time before there was
drive fuel to refill the ships tanks sattell
might sabotage that

  so he had to be treated as the pampered
guest of those who believed implicitly in
his will to murder them all arms were
safely locked away eventhe air-lock fast-
ening had to be dismantled so he couldnt
lock everybody else out of the ship

  and borden and ellen and jerry went
armed and had nerve-rackingly to be on
guard at all times but it would have been
ridiculous to confine sattell so he had the
status of a nonworking guest because he
was a potential murderer

  there was not much for jerry to do
either except hold conferences with his
admirers on the fifth twenty-hour day
after the damcs landing jerry set off
with an excited mob of furry trunk-waving
friends he carried a walkie-talkie de-
pending on the absence of radio waves
from the planets atmosphere to make its
use safe

  two hours after he had headed north
toward the ice borden and ellen came
back from an inspection tour of the crops
and fuel synthesizer and found that sattell
had disappeared too hed taken all the
food he could conveniently carry from their
depressing- short supply

  borden swore bitterly sattell underfoot
was a nuisance and a menace but sattell
at large might be more and worse there
was no glamor in being cast-away on this
alien world such as is shown in visi-screen
plays the danac was a small utility ship
suitable for small expeditions for scien-
tific purposes or for the staking out of
private planetary estates-a common prac-
tice these days-and the servicing of such
establishments

  her eighty-foot length now rested slight-
ly askew in the pit her landing had made
about her was arctic flora and the thick
fur of the bipeds suggested that they were
arctic animals themselves but here close
to the ice-cap was the only place on this
planet where a man might hope to sur-
vive it was madness for satell to leave
the ship

  it doesnt make sense borden said
what has he to gain he was afraid
wed go off and maroon him we cant do

that with crops going the synthesizer work-
ing and the drive pulled down so what
can he gain by running off

  ellen said uneasily jerrys armed
and he wont be suspecting anything

  borden scowled get out the talkie
and warn him if sattell surprises jerry
and gets his blaster he might bushwhack
us

cllen brought out the talkie she
turned it on and said crisply jerry
sattells disappeared come in piease

  jerry did not answer borden paced up
and down frowning and thinking of ever
more disastrous possibilities

  bring the talkie into the ship he said
presently well hook it to an outside
aerial jerry wont be traveling with his
turned on but hes bound to call us even-
tually

  he took the talkie from her carried it
inside the ship and plugged it in there in
minutes a speaker in the control room was
emitting the nondescript hissing which
was the random electronic noises made by
metal objects nearby the ship itself for
one

  im going to look in sattells cabin
said borden grimly

  that was drastic action on a space
journey privacy is at once so difficult and
so essential that nobody on a space ex-
pedition ever enters anothers private cabin
to look in sattells cabin was a great vio-
lation of normal rules of conduct but it
had to be done now

  borden went in thecabin and through
sattells possessions he came out look-
ing sick

  i found something he told ellen
when we were coming in i looked at that
white spot through a telescope i didnt
see anything worth noting but i snapped
the telecamera out of pure habit then i
forgot it but sattell didnt he made
this

  he showed her a photographic print
sattell had made it from the infra red
image on the full color photograph it was
an enlargement showing more detail than
borden had seen with the naked eye there
were shadows on this print the shadows
of structures there were buildings rising
from the white there were towers there


startling stories

was a city on the white spot from which
a heat-ray had been projected at the danai
out in space

  quite as important the threadlike lines
they had noticed were here plainly high-
ways leading away from it one led north
judging directions from the shadows it
reached toward the polar ice-cap near which
the small space-ship was grounded

  if sattell really expects us to kill him
said borden he could have headed for
that highway he might expect to make
a deal with our enemies by selling us out
even if they killed him out of hand the
fact that he was an alien would make them
hunt for us so he could figure that he
might make friends but even if he didnt
he would be sure to ruin us a win for him
either way

  ellen paled a little and the drives
pulled down and jerrys gone

  so theres nothing to do but wait and
see said borden

  he tried to work on the space-drive
all its parts were spread out on the drive
room floor when theyd repaired it be-
fore it had been so thoroughly fused that
a part looked good even if repaired to
the accuracy of a bent wax candle straight-
ened out by hand

  now the repairs looked very bad it
seemed incredible that anything so clum-
sily made should have worked but bor-
den couldnt keep his mind on it

  just on the off chance ellen he said
abruptly you will not leave the ship by
yourself wed better replace the lock-
door fastening too if we do have visitors
from the city  the white spot that wont
stop them but it might keep them from
taking us off-guard

he opened the thief-proof locker
where an essential part of the lock-
catch had been stored to protect it from
sattell it had a combination fastening
intended merely to prevent pilfering when
the ship was in-a spaceport

  borden reached in then he went com-
pletely and terribly white

  hes got the star charts and the log
he got in here somehow

  this was the ultimate in disaster be-
cause space is trackless at fifty light
years from earth the milky way is still

plain of course but the constellations have
ceased to be at a hundred light years one
is lost at a thousand light years-and
the danac had passed that point months
ago-a ship in space is in much the posi-
tion of a canary whose universe has con-
sisted of a cage in a single room and has
escaped out a window into the wide wide
world

  a space-ship has to keep an infinitely
precise log of bearings run and distances
traveled in all three dimensions it must
make photographic star charts and the
accuracy of all its records must be perfect
if it is to find the place it left nearly enough
for the stars to become familiar again so it
can locate the solar system-barely four
light hours in span

  i think i made a serious mistake
borden said quietly when i didnt kill
sattell

  to find a spot four light years across in
a galaxy a hundred thousand light years
wide would be difficult enough with good
maps with no maps they could spend
the rest of their lives wandering hopeless-
ly among the stars of which not one in ten
thousand had yet been named by men
landing on planets hot one in a hundred
thousand of which had known human
footsteps and they might search for
months or years upon a planet where there
was a human colony and never discover
its location

  borden clenched and unclenched his
hands sattell had been foisted upon him as
a crew-member while the danae was being
fitted out for space borden was filled with
a deadly cold fury in which regret for his
own past forbearance was his principal
emotion

  since hes taken the log and charts
he told ellen icily he means either to
bargain with us or to destroy us and if
i know sattell its six of one and half a
dozen of the other

  it would e sattell now had tfie power
of life and death over borden and ellen
and jerry he would not trade that power
for anything less in fact he would not
dare yield it at all because he was so sure
he would be killed himself if he did the
only bargain he could conceivably make
would be one in which they surrendered
themselves to him absolutely armed him
white spot	

and disarmed themselves and threw them-
selves on sattells mercy and sattell had
little mercy

  you might try calling jerry again
said borden once weve warned him
we can try to track sattell by his foot-
prints his shoes have heels and the
ground is soft

  ellen picked up the walkie-talkie micro-
phone again

  jerry sattells disappeared come in
please    jerry sattells disappeared
come in please  

  her voice went on and  borden went
grimly over the ship looking for signs of
what else sattell might have busied himself
with in the past twenty-four hours he
had believed that sattell being in the same
boat with the rest ofthem-in the same
space-ship anyhow-would automatically
have thought of the group no sane man
did think of anything but cooperation with
his companions in disaster

  but tbere exists a kind of human being
he knew which may lie a mutant which
makes a career of the gratification of all
emotions impulses momentary desires
which knows no purpose save personal
satisfaction and simply does not think like
nonmutant human beings

  there were all too many specimens of
this type among humans some ordinarily
masked themselves but if sattell ever had
he now had been unmasked

iv

eikx called and called her voice
grew weary and her shoulders dropped
hopelessly as hours passed without reply

  borden found where sattell had crossed
the wires so that if the ship took off and
went out into space the control board
would show all air vents as safely sealed
but there would remain a small steady
drain of leakage of the ships air stores

  he also found a small alteration of the
water-recovery system they would have
run out of water on the way home he
found a cunning circuit arranged so that
if the ship rose on interplanetary drive
and set out  even a hopeless search for
home the instant it went into overdrive
its power tanks would fuse and short and
it would be left driveless and powerless to

crash or drift helplessly until its occu-
pants died or went mad of despair

  borden came back to the control room
with his face set in savage lines

  we didnt watch him he said bitter-
ly so he took advantage right now lies
gloating sure we have to accept any terms
lie demands for the use of the log and
maps to get home and hes gloating lo-
calise hell have his revenge if we refuse
and if we do make a bargain hell tell us
how many ways wed have died if we had
not made it weve got to check every
device and every piece of equipment in
the slrip before we can lift off this planet-
even after weve got fuel

  he looked out a port the shadows
were long and slanting it was twilight
night was near

  ellen said drearily into thetalkie
jerrv sattell has vanished please
come in    jerry sattell has vanished

 mease come in

  far away a tiny figure appeared in the
half light it came hastening toward the
danae it was one of the furry bipeds
probably one of those that had accom-
panied jerry it came through the dusk
at an agitated lope using its long furry
arms to balance itself it made an agitated
leap at sight of the space-ship and rushed
onward more frantically than before

  look cried borden that looks like
a messenger

  lie went out the air-lock door his hand
on the weapon in his holster

  the biped bounced at sight of him its
fur flattened but it came  at a tearing
rush it leaped and slid and came to rest
before him its trunk waving wildly he
bent to scratch it according to the custom
that had become established in the past
four days rut it did not wait it stood
up making excited chirping noises and
gesturing -wildly it made grimaces in
the falling night

  then borden noticed blood on its fur  

 n hour later an almost unbearable
bright light appeared in the distance
moving toward the danae jerry had car-
ried a handflash of course but nothing
equal to this judging by the wavering of
the light it was mounted on a vehicle of
	startling stories

some sort

  ellens voice said wearily for the thou-
sandth time

  jerry sattells vanished come in
please

  you can stop that ellen borden told
her the calls answered it looks as if
the real natives of this planet are coming
to call

  he shrugged and turned to the furry
creature which now was inside the ship
hed bandaged its wound-a clean deep
puncture in the flesh of its arm he led
it to the air-lock

  get going he said curtly your
masters are coming they wont like it
that youve made friends with us scat

  but the creature only blinked at the ap-
proaching light while its fur flattened it
went bouncing out and toward the sway-
ing lurching approaching light racing joy-
fully to meet it

  borden stared then he saw that other
figures were about the approaching light
beam-other furry dancing leaping crea-
tures they ran and gesticulated happily
about the advancing vehicle

  it didnt make sense but nothing did
make sense on this planet 

  borden waited in the air-lock with ellen
behind him and a blaster in his hand in
the darkness the vehicle came lurching
onward with surprising quiet its light
swayed and it had moved as if to turn
when borden threw on the outside lights

  a semicircle of the sparse green vege-
tation sprang into brilliance borden and
his wife were relatively in shadow they
could see the vehicle clearly

  it was nearly thirty feet long and rolled
on two curious devices which were not
caterpillar treads but not exactly wheels
either a loping wildly excited horde of
bipeds-including the one borden had
bandaged-surrounded it making way for
it but escorting it in wild enthusiasm

  the thing was caked with dirt it was
not merely dust- it was packed with dried
clay as if it had been buried and only
recently exhumed a round blister at the
front which might be plastic had been
partly cleared of dirt but there were still
areas in which clay clung and made it
opaque

  it curved about and swung parallel to

the ship it stopped within twrenty feet
of the air-lock then an oval window-
which looked as if somebody had scratched
caked clay off it with a stick-turned end-
wise quite impossibly and became a door
the door slid aside the interior of the
vehicle was dark

  borden held his blaster ready he
wouldnt shoot first but there had leen
a heat-ray flung at the danae   

a nd jerry got out of the incredible ve-
hide and stood blinking embarrassed-
iv in the light from the outer-lock glare
lamps

  borden snapped whos with you
why nobody said jerry i tried to
tell you by talkie but it wouldnt work
im afraid sattell did something to it
before i left its dead

  whats that thing demanded borden
that-that wagon

  its a ground car sir jerry said un-
comfortably there are thirty or forty
of them in a sort of valley about ten miles
away this one was half-buried in mud
and the others are the same or worse
the-er-creatures-took me there and
dug this out for me they apparently
wanted us to have it

  and it runs said borden there was
again no sense to anything a ground
car buried in mud should not run when
excavated

  yes sir said jerry they dug it
out for me and i got in it and found the
skeletons and the weapons

  ellen said skeletons

  borden said weapons

  yes sir i tried to ask you for advice
over the talkie and like i said it wouldnt
work so i fiddled around a bit and the
car showed signs of life and i found out
how to run it so i brought it back the
weapons work too sir you point them at
something and push a knob and they-well
theyre pretty deadly

  borden said flatly sattells ducked out
with the log and star maps and food one
of the creatures just came in wounded
i thought sattell had planned to ambush
you and get your blaster if he did trail
you-

  jerry blinked i didnt see a sign of him
just a moment sir
white spot	

  he turned to his furry companions
flushing a little he pulled something out
of his pocket and hung it onto his chin
it was a sock-one of his socks-partly
filled with clay

  borden was still unable to find any two
things happening on this planet which
added together to make sense the sight
of jerry fastening a clay-filled sock to his
chin seemed slightly more insane than any-
thing else that had happened

  ive found out how they talk sir
jerry said shvly its a sort of sign
language with their hands and trunk and
they make noises for inflections and tenses
sir and emotional overtones im not
too good yet but-

  the scene before the lock door was uni-
que the clay-caked thirty-foot vehicle
looked more like a land yacht than a
ground car it was made of a golden metal
two dozen or more of the furry bipeds
were regarding jerry as he made gestures
and every so often stopped to adjust the
position of his artificial trunk when he
made sounds at them their fur flattened
when he adjusted his sock trunk although
it far from resembled their own they
seemed entranced when he finished the
creature with the bandaged arm made ela-
borate gesticulations accompanied by
chirping sounds even borden now that
he had the key gathered a dim idea of
what the biped was trying to say

  he says sir reported jerry sweat-
ing that a stick came through the air
and stuck in his arm he pulled it out and
ran away he kept on running then he
saw this ship ran to it and you bandaged
his arm for him

  borden snapped an arrow sattells
made a bow and arrow he sabotaged
your talkie so you couldnt be warned
about him and he probably hoped to trail
you and kill you with an arrow so he
could take your blaster and come back
and kill us maybe he was just practicing
when he hit this poor creature anyhow
he seems to be trying everything all at
once to destroy us he added sharply
but weapons jerry from what you say
therell be more weapons in those other
wagons if he finds them and he probably
will since he was trailing you-

  jerry said i worried about that sir

so i got the creatures to dig down to the
doors of all the wagons in sight  thought
wed better have the weapons safe before
-er-sattell tried to help us find out about
the vehicles ive got all the weapons
right here but there werent weapons in
all the wagons in most of them there
were just skeletons

  borden was again reminded of the great
number of things which did not fit to-
gether into any coherent picture he said
impatiently

  then sattell wont get the weapons
but whats this you keep on saying about
skeletons did you bring any of them
jerry said i left those in here undis-
turbed if youll take the weapons as i
hand them out you can look them over
theyre just as  first saw them

  he reached inside the vehicle passed
out objects midway between rifles and
blasters in size they were surprisingly
light they could have been aluminum
except that they were the color of gold
or copper there were three armsful of
them

  ellen took them inside and came back
now ill look at those skeletons said
borden

he took jerrys hand flash and climbed
inside jerry said apologetically to ellen
i got so excited about what i found
that i forgot all about eating do you
think i could fix something

  ill do it for you jerry said ellen

v

she took him inside sattell had carried
away about most of the food in the
current-use freezer and the storage lock-
ers were nearly empty but she prepared
an ample meal for him she couldnt even
guess at the significance of what hed
found but she knew there was meaning
to it if only it could be found

  jerry was eating contentedly and tell-
ing ellen about his journey with the furry
bipeds when borden came in he went
to a tool locker got out a small torch and
went out again

  considerably later the outer lock door
clanked then borden came back into
the cabin where jerry was still talking
with his mouth full
m	startling stories

  im beginning to get an idea of whats
happened on this planet borden said
grimly jerry was there any sign of a
highway where you found this bunch of
wagons 

  jerry considered the front part of
this one he offered finally was buried
deeper than the back it went into a sort
of bill and under the wheels there was
flat stone it could have been a highway
buried under the mud that partly covered
up what you call the wagons sir

  borden nodded ive brazed the steer-
ing tiller of that wagon so it cant lie steer-
ed he observed and ive replaced the
lock fastener so sattell cant break into the
ship we can sleep tonight tomorrow
well go over to those wagons and disable
them all and then in this wagon you
brought well hunt sattell down i have
an idea hed better not have a wagon of
his own it might not be good for us
jerry asked rather breathlessly what
did you think of the skeletons sir i left
them exactly as they were he hesitated
i thought they were a lot like human
skeletons is that right

  quite right agreed borden there
is an extra rib  each side and three
fewer vertebrae and their joints were a
little different but they were people as i
interpret the word were there skeletons
in all the wagons you entered

  yes sir

  ellen said impatiently what did you
find out dee

  i guessed borden told her but id
bet on my guesses for one thing the
group in this vehicle was a family one
was taller and stockier than the others
i could be wrong but i think it was the
male-the father there is a slightly
smaller slightly slenderer skeleton there
too it has jewelry on it and there are
two smaller skeletons he took a deep
breath the small skeletons were laid
out neatly comfortably the next to
largest skeleton was with them the stocky
skeleton    hed killed himself jerry

  the weapons make holes like that sir
said jerry i tried one on the ground
even in the ground cars where there were
no weapons one skeleton was always like
that with a hole in the skull

  yes said borden they must have

loaned the weapons to each other for that
purpose

  ellen protested but dee what was
it

  ive a very complete guess borden
said evenly it includes jerrys furry
friends they act like domestic animals
like pets with an inbred passionate desire
to be approved of by-people dogs are
like that you agree jerry

  oh yes sir

  if a party of human beings in flight
from something dreadful had come to
some place in the arctic on earth where
they couldnt go any farther where the
wives and families they had with them
had no chance of survivalbecause of the
thing from which they fled what would
they do

  jerrv said awkwardly if i may say
so sir it does look just like that

  borden went on without apparent emo-
tion the men of those families would
know there was no escape the odds are
that theyd put their family dogs out of
the ground cars because they might live
but if the situation was absolutely hopeless
they might not want their families to suf-
fer-what theyd first tried to escape so
the children would die painlessly so
would the women and then the men would
kill themselves possibly anyhow or
they might go back and fight here it 
seems they killed themselves

jcllen protested but what could be
so hopeless if the pets survived-

  my guess doesnt run to what they fled
from ellen but i think its the white
spot that flung that heat-rav at us and
i think that after all the people in the
ground cars were dead winter came
and covered up the vehicles with snow
spring came and floods washed mud along
the highway and partly covered up the
cars with mud that went on for years
and years and years the pets that had
been put out of the cars did survive they
were probably arctic animals to begin with
judging by their fur and they have a
language of sorts they yearned for their
masters that was instinct but they told
their children-pups what have you-
alout the masters they had lost and one
day a space-ship came bumbling down out
white spot



of the sky and landed with a crash-and
jerry got out of it and he was like their
masters so they have adopted us as their
masters and so-thats iny guess all
of it

  dee cried ellen softly how ter-
rible

  you think sir asked jerry that they
were running away from something on the
white spot

  we did said borden we had to
maybe they had to too

think there was a sound somewhere they
would look intently in the suspected direc-
tion until assured there was nothing amiss
they were much like dogs back on earth
waiting hopefully for their masters to get
up and be ready to pay attention to them
again

  hours later the sky to the east paled
there was a chill mist to the northward
toward the polar cap the ground in that
direction glistened with the wet of con-
densation when the sky grew brighter

well look at it this way    maybe martians anrl
earthmen are really birds of a feather  

  but what do you think it is

  that borden told him is something
i hope we dont have to find out right
now i suggest that we get some sleep
and presently there was silence inside
the danae while the night grew deeper
and darker outside

  there was no moon on this planet but
there were many stars in the sky in the
starlight the furry bipeds waited patiently
about the hull for dawn when the humans
would come out again some of them slept
some sat erect blinking meditatively one
or two walked about from time to time-
occasionally one or more seemed to

but here so near the desert which save
for the white spot covered the planet from
pole to pole there was no such excess
of moisture the ground here was damp
because of seepage

  in a little while an eerie half-light spread
over this curious world the furry crea-
tures sat up and scratched themselves
luxuriously and stretched in human fash-
ion some of them scuffled amiably tum-
bling over and over each other as if to
warm themselves by exercise

  a little longer and the sun rose and
shortly after that there were clankings
when borden unfastened the air-lock and


startling stories

came out immediately he was the center
of a throng of the bipeds lyingflat on
their backs with their stubby trunks waving
urgently in the air waiting to be scratched

  he scratched them gravely one by one
then jerry came out and the process had
to be repeated the sun was low and jer-
rys shadow was thirty feet long on the
sparsely covered ground

  relieved of the bipeds attentions bor-
den moved off to one side he had one of
the stubby golden-colored light metal
weapons in his hand he examined it care-
fully again there was a sort of stock and
a barrel three inches in diameter with an
extremely tiny opening at its end there
was a round knob on one side borden
unscrewed the knob a little pointed the
weapon carefully away from the danae
ancl the furry creatures and shifted the
knob

  there was no noise but what seemed
to ik a rod of flame shot out of the tiny
muzzle where it touched the ground
there was a burst of steam and flame and
smoke from the scorched- vegetation

  borden turned it off quickly and aimed
at a greater distance he could not dis-
cover any limit to its range in which re-
sject it was a better weaon than the blaster
of human manufacture he wore at his hip
tt would be decidedly undesirable for sat-
tell to get hold of a weapon like this

  he went into the ship and when he came
out again ellen was with him they put
the golden-metal weapons in the ground
car they brought out food ellen looked
uneasily in the back where she had heard
there were skeletons but they were gone
a mound of loosened soil nearby told
where borden had buried them together

  all set jerry asked borden ive
locked the ship so sattell cant get in as i
told you were going to disable those other
wagons and track down sattell if we can
capture him reasonably intact well put a
cardiograph on him and ask him loaded
questions about the ships log and star
maps his pulse should change enough to
enable us to track it down but first we
wreck those wagons

  jerry made gestures to his furry friends
they gesticulated back extravagantly he
climbed in the vehicle borden freed its
tiller and jerry drove

tor people effectively shipwrecked on an
j- inimical planet and with no real hope
of ever returning to their home- it was
hardly appropriate that they got absorbed
in the operation of a local vehicle but this
vehicle large and roomy was not a ground
car so much as it was a land cruiser it
ran with astonishing smoothness consid-
ering that it lacked pneumatic tires and
though from the outside it seemed to lurch
and sway as it covered the rough ground
inside the lurchings were not felt at all

  the bipeds ran and skipped and loped
beside it jerry picked up a little speed
they strained themselves to keep up

  jerry had said ten miles actually the
distance was nearer twelve there was
snow in patches here and there the air
grew misty through the mist the edge
of the ice-cap could be seen a wall of
opaque white some sixty or seventy feet
high at its rounded melting edge and rising
to greater thickness beyond and they
came to a small running stream some four
or five feet wide the first running water
they had seen on this planet

  and there were the clustered vehicles
about forty of them lined up as if on a
highway which had come to an end in an
ice barrier now melted away

  the vehicles were partly or wholly cov-
ered with water-borne day which had been
laid upon them by just such meltings of
the ice-cap they ran on into a small hil-
lock which had formed since they had come
to a stop at this place some were merely
hummocks of clay-covered metal barely
showing above the ground some were
what could be called only hub-deep in the
clay but it was being buried in the clay
which had preserved them

  you see sir jerry explained i got
the creatures to help me dig down to the
doors so i got into all that show for
weapons 

  but borden did not compliment him
though a compliment was due instead
borden said in a toneless voice

  i also see that sattell has been here
he must have trailed you he saw where
you had driven one vehicle away so he
dug out the tracks of another one-there
-and tried it and it worked sattell is
gone

  it was true jerry stricken drove over
white spot



to the new deep gouges in the earth which
showed plainly where a way had been dug
to take out another gold-metal vehicle
on its wheel-like treads and that it had
been backed from where it had been almost
buried

  bones on the ground showed where sat-
tell had savagely flung the pitiful relics
of the original owners of the car the
prints of his boots were plain in the loosened
dirt

  weve got to chase him ellen asked
apprehensively

  he has the star maps and the log
borden said tonelessly or else he knows
where he hid them

  but where would he go persisted
ellen

  he knows were after him said bor-
den he knows were armed and i doubt
that he is except for his bow and arrow
where would he go for help except to the
place where we have enemies

  the track of the other vehicle was clear
there had been no feet heavier than those
of jerrys biped friends on any of this
ground for many many years there was
a deep furrow where the other ground car
the one sattell had taken had rolled away

  jerry put on speed

  borden said ill watch how you drive
this thing jerry and relieve you presently
sattell cant drive night and day we can
and theres a long way to go well
catch him

  but sattell had a head start five miles
from the beginning of the chase the track
they followed swung to the right and down
a rolling hillside they followed and a
seamless highway built of stone patently
artificial came out of the hillside and
stretched away across country

  it was forty feet wide and here in
some dust that had drifted across it at
some spots they saw the trail of sattells
car at other places even for most of the
way the winds had kept the roadway clear

  jerry increased his speed borden
thought to look at the road behind them

  ellen understanding said no the poor
creatures couldnt keep up they were
running after us as if their hearts were
breaking but they couldnt make it

  ten miles farther on the highway was
overwhelmed by wind-drifted sand the

trail of sattells fleeing car went up over
the sand dune they went after it half
a mile farther the highway was clear
again it swung south headed out across
the desert

  they did not catch sight of sattell or
his car

  for a stretch of twenty-five miles the
arrow-straight road was raised above the
average level of the sands and it was wind-
swept then it wrent into a low range of
rust-colored hills here they saw signs
again of sattells passing the streaked
rounded furrow of his vehicles peculiar
tread in wind-blown sand across the road

  on the far side of the hills they thought
they had overtaken him when they saw
the glint of golden metal a little off the
highway

  they stopped borden and jerry ap-
proached the spot weapons ready it was
a ground car past question one like their
own but it had not been newly wrecked
that disaster had happened generations
ago the car had literally been pulled in
half it had been gripped by something
unthinkably powerful and wrenched in two
the metal strained and stretched before
it broke showed what had happened

  there were bones nearby not skeletons
bones individual bones not gnawed
not broken simply separated by feet and
yards of space

vi

some ten miles farther on they came to
the first of the forts a great towering
structure of rocks piled together across
the road it was a parapet sixty feet high
enclosing a square of space in sheltered
places among the rocks there was a vast
amount of soot as if flames had burned
here fiercely but there was no charcoal
here too were innumerable bones there
would have been thousands of skeletons in
this walled area if they had been put to-
gether but they were separate every
bone no matter how small had been com-
pletely separated from every other bone

  they could be identified however these
were the bones of people like those who
once had owned this golden-metal vehicle
they had died here by thousands weap-
ons bent and ruined proved that they had
died fighting after death each body had
	startling stories

been exhaustively disjoined and the sepa-
rate hones scattered utterly without sys-
tem and the victors had apparently done
nothing else

  borden knitted his brows as the ground
car went on having perilously skirted
around the walls terrv seemed to feel
that he had wasted time looking he tried
a higher rate of speed the car yielded it
without effort there seemed to be no
limit to the speed at which these remarkable
vehicles could travel without vibration or
swaying or jolting

  that first fort was perhaps fiftv miles
behind when bordens expression changed
from harried bewilderment to shock he
stared ahead as the vehicle sped along the
geometrically linear highway wind-swept
and free of dust as it was

  he said slowly thats right ferry
make as much speed as you can when
youre tired ill drive weve got to catch
sattell before he reaches that white spot
its possible that more than our lives
depend on it 

  they did not catch sattell though they
drove night and day their speed varied
from fifteen miles an hour when they
crawled over occasionally drifted sand
dunes which swallowed the highway to
two hundred miles an hour or better
borden estimated grimly that they averaged
more than a thousand miles per twenty-
hour day

  sattell couldnt have kept that up so
they must have passed him probably as
he slept in some hiding place off a rocky
spot in the highway where there would be
 trail to guide them to him but of course
he wind might have erased his trail any-
where

  ellen tried to rest or doze in the back
while jerry or borden drove on one rest-
ing while the other drove but after the
first day the actual overtaking of sattell
plainly was not bordens purpose it was
clear that he meant to get ahead of sattell
to reach the white spot first

  on the second day of their journeying
they found a second fort this also was a
structure across the highway defended
from attack in the direction for which
they were headed it had been more care-
fully built than the other one this had
been more constructed of squared stones

lifted into position by construction engines
whose sand-eroded carcasses were still in
place

  there also were larger instruments of
warfare here worn away by centuries of
exposure to blowing sand the fort itself
had many times been filled with sand and
emptied again by the wind onlv under
archways were there any signs of soot as
if flames had burned terribly here some
land cruisers such as the one in yvhich they
rode had been destroyed like the one they
had seen at the first fort-pulled apart

  like the other fort this one had not been
demolished after its capture not even the
cranes and weapons had been seized but
the defenders had been completely dis-
membered no two bones were fcver at-
tached to each other rarely had one been
broken none had been gnawed some
were sand-worn but each was complete
and entirely separate

  and tens of thousands-not merely
thousands-had died here their bones
proved it

ellen watched bordens face as they
drove through this fortress

  do you know what happened dee
she asked

  i think so he said coldly

  the white spot t looks as if they
had been fighting something thatcame from
there

  they were said borden and i
dont want sattell to encounter the thing
thev were fighting he knows too much

  she studied his expression she knew
that thev were making the top possible
speed toward that same white spot from
which a heat-ray had been thrown at them
he hadnt explained jerry was too dif-
fident to ask ellen was not but something
occurred to her suddenly

  you said the thing she said star-
tled  not creatures or people or anything
like that you said the thing

  he grimaced but did not answer her
instead he said ill take the tiller jerry
weve still got the talkie that sattell sabo-
taged havent we

  jerry nodded and shifted the tiller to
him theyd discovered that the steering
gear could be shifted from side to side of
the front of the vehicle so that it could be
white spot	

driven from either the right or left side
on a planet without cities but with high-
ways running thousands of miles to the
polar ice-caps long-distance driving would
be the norm conveniences for that pur-
pose would be logical drivers could re-
lieve each other without difficulty

  look it over commanded borden
the logical way to sabotage a talkie would
be to throw its capacitances out of balance
no visible sign of damage but i couldnt
find a band it wasnt tuned to see if that
was the trick

  jerry busied himself as borden drove
on here the highway wound through
great hills the color of iron rust and carved
by wind and sand into incredibly grotesque
shapes a long trail of swirling dust arose
behind the racing cruiser

  borden said abruptly ive been think-
ing check me will you two first i
think the people who made this vehicle
were much like us the skeletons proved
that they had families and pets and they
made cars like this to travel long distances
on highways theyd built from pole to pole
this car uses normal electric power and
its power source is good so they should
have had radio frequency apparatus as well
as power but no radio frequency is being
used on this planet the race that built
this car then has either changed its culture
entirely or been wiped out

  jerry said blankly you mean the
people in the white spot-

  are not and were- not the race that
built the roads and made this machine
said borden in fact weve passed two
forts where people like us died by tens
of thousands fighting against something
from the white spot they had long-range
weapons but at the end they were fighting
with fire you saw the soot it was as if
they burned oil by thousands of gallons
to hold back something their long-range
weapons couldnt stop fire is a short-
range weapon though a sun-mirror need
not be but nothing stopped this enemy
vehicles like this were pulled right in half
that doesnt suggest people it suggests
a tiling-something so gigantic and hor-
ribly strong that needle beams of flame
couldnt stop it and against which flame
seemed a logical weaixm to use it must
have been gigantic because it could pull

a land car apart endwise 

  ellen waited jerry knitted his brows

  im afraid jerry said i cant think
of anything that would be big and  i
just cant think what they could have been
fighting

  think of what it wanted borden said
drily it killed the population wjped them
out back on earth a long long time
ago ghenghis khan led the mongols to
destroy kharesmia his soldiers looted the
cities they carried away all the wealth
they murdered the people plains were
white with the skeletons of the folk they
murdered do you notice a difference
here

  jerry said irrelevantly you were right
about the talkie sir somebodys thrown
it all out of tuning ill have to match it
with the other to make use of it then
he said painstakingly the difference be-
tween what you mentioned and the con-
querors of the forts is that the loot was left
in the forts engines and weapons and so
on werent bothered then he said in
sudden surprise but the people werent
left as skeletons they were all scattered

f rry raised startled eyes from the
talkie on which he was working and
suddenly he froze borden braked stopped
the car they had come to a place where
shattered ground cars were on the highway
on the sides of the road everywhere here
the road ran between monstrous steep-
sided hills

  borden started the car again and drove
carefully around half of a vehicle which
lay on the highway weapons had been
mounted in it for shooting through the
blister that was like the blister through
which he looked in fheir car

  there was a battle here too he said
they fought with cars here maybe a
delaying action to gain time to build the
fort we just left there are bones in these
cars too

  but what were they fighting dee
ellen demanded again uneasily

  borden drove carefully past the scene
of ancient battle-and defeat he did not
answer

  after a time ellen said more uneasily
still do you mean that whatever they
fought against was-going to eat them
	startling stories

it wanted their-bodies

  so far as we can tell said rorden
it took nothing else didnt even want
their bones

  he drove on and on he didnt elaborate
there was no need a creature which
consumed its victims without crushing them
or biting them or destroying the structure
of their bones it must simply envelop
them like an amoeba a creature which
discarded the inedible parts of its prey in
separate fragments without order of posi-
tion without selection that also must be
like an amoeba which simply extrudes in-
edibles through its skin ellen swallowed
suddenly and her eyes looked haunted

  something like a livingjelly dee she
said slowly tt would flow along a high-
way if you shot it with a needle-ray it
wouldnt stop because it would use the
burned parts of its own body as food
youd think of burning oil as a way to
fight it youd try to make forts it couldnt
climb over where would such a thing
come from dee

dorden said drily from space may-
be as a spore of its own deadly race
or it might be intelligent enough for space-
travel it should be tt knew enough to
make a sun-mirror of itself to destroy us
tt also knew enough to make itself into
straining cables to pull ground cars like
this apart to get at the people inside
ellen shuddered rut that must be
wrong dee a creature like that would
cover a whole planet it would consume
every living thing and become itself the
planets surface or its skin

  rut this planet is mostly desert ror-
den reminded her it may be that there
was just one oasis on which a civilization
started sun-power was all it had it
would make use of that it would find the
ice-caps at its poles and build highways
to them to haul water to extend itself its
people would delight in such strangeness
as running streams like the one we saw
if something hellish came out of space
landed and attacked that oasis the thing
would follow the survivors of its first at-
tacks along the highways by which they re-
treated when they built forts they would
congregate in numbers it could not resist
attacking and-

  jerry glanced up his face was white
and he looked sick

  i recall sir he murmured that you
said sattell knew too much i believe you
guess the thing you are talking about
absorbed the knowledge of the people it
consumed is that right and if it should
absorb more from sattell and through him
know about us-

  my guess said borden is that it
knew we were in a space-ship in one there
are always relays working machines run-
ning things happening-as is always the
case where there are humans where there
are living beings such happenings can
be detected i also believe this thing can
tell when it can reach the living and when
it cant when it can reach them it un-
doubtedly moves to devour them when it
cant it tries to destroy them-as it tried
with us that may be because of its own
intelligence or it may be because of the
knowledge gained through what it has con-
sumed

  thats why i dont intend to let sattell
be consumed by it he knows how the
domes drive works and how it should be
repaired he knows how to read the log
and the maps he stole just as a precau-
tion im not going to let that thing in the
white spot gain the knowledge that there is
a planet called earth with life all over it
on every continent and in the deeps of the
seas if the thing in the white spot were
to find out that there is such a place and
if it is intelligent enough to wipe out a
civilized race on this planet it might be
tempted to take to space agan or at least
to send say part of itself

vii

abruptly the wind-carved rust-col-
ored hills came to an end the highway
curved slightly and reached out toward the
horizon rut the horizon was not now a
mere unending expanse of dunes and desert

  a bare few miles distant the desert was
white there were no dunes a vast vast
flat mass of nothing-in-particular not even
raising the level of the ground reached
away and away to this worlds edge it
looked remarkably like a space on which
a light snowfall had descended shining in
the sunlight until melting should come the
white spot	

tower of the city in the midst of it also
were shimmering white

  rut it al was not a completely quiescent
whiteness there were ripplings in it a
pinnacle rose abruptly and borden backed
the vehicle fiercely as the pinnacle formed
a cuplike end of gigantic size and the in-
terior of that cup turned silvery

  the rust-colored hills blotted out just
as a beam of purest flame licked from it to
the spot where the ground car had been
the moment before rocks split and crack-
led in the heat

  the beam faded the light vanished

  so said borden matter-of-factly con-
tinuing what he had been saying as if
there had been no interruption as long
as sattell is at large why we have to kill
that thing i think i know how to do it
with a little overload i believe that walkie-
talkie will do the trick you see the
thing is terrifically vulnerable now it
has conquered this planet it was irresist-
ible nothing could stand against it so it
will be easy to kill

  but in that opinion borden was mis-
taken living creatures moving toward
the white spot should have had no reason
to be suspicious traveling at high speed
along the highway they should have con-
tinued at high sieed to the very border of
the white spot at least more probably
they should have entered the white-cov-
ered area filled with a mild curiosity as to
what made it so white and of course the
white spot-the horror the protaean proto-
plasm of which it was composed-would
have engulfed them but the car stopped

and the white spot was intelligent

                      

twenty minutes after the first crack-
ling impact of a heat beam in the valley
borden was out of the ground car and mov-
ing carefully to peer around a rocky column
at the white spot

  its appearance had changed there was
a rise in the ground level at the edge of the
white spot now the stuff which was the
creature itself-which ellen had aptly
called a living jelly-had flowed from other
places to form a hillock there borden re-
garded it with suspicion obviously it
could send out pseudopods amoebae can
do that and he had just seen this thing
form a sun-ray projector of itself

  but borden was not aware of the pos-
sibilities of a really protaean substance to
take any form it desires

  he saw the pseudopod start out he was
astounded it did not thrust out the hil-
lock the raised-up ground level suddenly
sped out along the highway with an in-
credible swiftness he regarded it with a
shock that was almost paralyzing

  but not quite he fled to the car
leaped into it and sent it racing down the
highway at the topmost speed he could
coax from it his face was gray and
sweating his hands shook

  ellen gasped what dee whats hap-
pened

  the beast said borden in an icy
voice its after us

  ellen stared back and she saw the tip-
end of the white-spots pseudopod as it
came racing into the end of the valley
through which the highway ran it was a
fifty-foot shapeless blob of glistening trans-
lucent horror and it did not thrust out
from the parent body it laid down a
carpet of its own substance over which its
fifty-foot mass slid swiftly

  an exact if unimpressive analogy would
be a cake of wet soap or a mass of grease
sliding over a space it lubricated with its
own substance as it flowed leaving a con-
tact with its starting point as a thin film
behind or it could be likened to a roll of
carpet speeding forward as it unrolled

  a hillock of glistening jelly the height
of a five-story building plunged into the
valley at forty miles an hour or better
by sheer momentum it flowed up the moun-
tainside curved and came sliding back
to the highway and on again after the
ground car

  but the car was in retreat at over a
hundred miles an hour it reached a
hundred and fifty miles an hour two
hundred

  borden stopped it five miles down the
highway and wiped his forehead

  now he said grimly i see why ordir
nary weapons didnt work against it the
thing is protean not amoeboid it isnt
only senseless jelly it has brains

  he considered frowning darkly then
he turned the ground car off the road he
drove it around a dune and another it
became suddenly possible to see across the
	startling stories

desert toward the white mass at the
horizon

there was a ribbon a road a high-
way of whiteness leading toward the
city the five-story-high mass of stuff that
had come sweeping toward the car had
traveled along the highway carpeting the
rocky surface with its own substance now
there were new masses of loathesome white-
ness surging along the living road there
were billows surgings undulations it was
building up for a fresh and irresistible
surge

  across the desert a new pseudopod a
new extension of the white organism
moved with purposeful swiftness it was
somehow like a narrow line of whitecaps
moving impossibly over aridness

  it knows we stopped borden said
it wont attack itll act as if baffled-un-
til theres a fresh mass of it behind us then
it will drive together and catch us in be-
tween jerry are you set to try the talkie
stuff

  pretty well sighed jerry

  the car crawled back to the highway
the waiting mass of jellylike monster was
larger it grew larger every instant as
fresh waves of its protaean substance ar-
rived through the throbbing of the pseudo-
pod back to the oasis

  tum on the walkie-talkie commanded
borden

  jerry white and shaken threw the
switch an invisible beam of micro-waves
sped down the valley behind the halted car
it reached the blob of jelly which now was
as large as when it had started from the
parent mass the jelly quivered violently
then it was still

  turn it off ordered borden why
didnt that work

  jerry turned off the micro-wave beam
the jelly quivered once more borden
watching with keen eyes said

  on again

  the pile of jelly quivered a third time
but less violently the first impact of the
micro-wave beam had bothered it but it
had been able to adjust almost instantly
it perceived the micro-waves that much
was certain but it could adjust to them

  borden said furiously the damned
thing can learn it can think it is smart

  as the devil but if  am right what it
wants more than anything else is not to do
anything it has to be awake when we
are near it cant help itself but it wants
to sleep we and our micro-waves are like
mosquitos buzzing around a mans head
i thought they-

  he stopped short but affer a moment
laughed unpleasantly

  i get it when it learns a pattern it
can disregard it living things always act
without pattern so it cant disregard them
but it could disregard an unmodulated
beam lets see what a modulated one will
do jerry the microphone

  when the talkie went on and its beam
of micro-waves hit the monstrous feature-
less thing it did not even quiver then
borden said into the microphone

   mary had a little lamb its fleece was
white as snow and everywhere that marv
went-

  the monstrous mass of ghastly jelly
plunged toward him

  ellen shot the ground car away bor-
dens throat contracted when his voice
stopped the frenzied movement of the
horror ceased it stood trembling in a gi-
gantic glistening heap it seemed to wait
borden considered grimly

  it could make a sun-mirror now he
decided buf not a very big one wed
run away it doesnt want to chase us away
until that other arm of stuff gets behind
us if we run it will follow it could
follow the original inhabitants of this planet
for thousands of miles doubtless it would
follow us as far

  and theres always sattell weve got
to kill it how  i thought a walkie-talkie
beam would irritate it it can adjust to it
then i thought a modulated wave-voice-
modulated-would exhaust it but no we
need something new right now 

there was silence then ellen said
uneasily

  maybe this idea isnt sensible but could
it be that the walkie-talkie beam just
wasnt strong enough it was too much
like-like tickling it arousing its appetite
maybe if the beam were powerful enough
it would be like paralysis

  borden did not even answer he hauled
at the objects that had been found to be
white spot



  the covers to the power-leads of the vehicle
he and jerry worked feverishly without
words then borden stood up

  this time we are really risking every-
thing he said grimly the full power
of the cars power source goes into the
beam if a walkie-talkie beam was appetiz-
ing this ought to curl its hair switch
jerrv microphone on

viii

some hundreds of kilowatts of power
in inodulated-wave form would go out
now into the lxdy of a creature whose
normal sensory reception centers would be
accustomed to handling minute fractions
of one watt the talkie could handle the
power of course with cold-emission oscil-
lators there was no danger of burning out
a wave-generating unit

   -the lamb was sure to go  said
borden

  the two-mile distant mass of horrid
jelly began to quiver uncontrollably but
without any purpose at all borden said
with a terrible satisfaction

   tt followed her to school one day
which was against the rule it made the
children laugh and play to see the lamb
at school 

  the shapeless mass of living stuff made
tortured upheavals it flung up spires of
glistening stuff ii writhed tt contorted
it flung itself crazily against the hillsides

   twas brillig  said borden and
the slithy toves did gyre and gymbal in
the wabe all mimsy were the borogroves
and the mome raths outgrabe 

  the jelly fled it flowed back upon the
carpet of its own substance on which it had
been able to move with such ghastly speed
it flowed down from a mound to a flat-
tened thickening of the pseudopod which
had thrown itself at the car

  that pseudopod flowed away upon itself
it fled it raced frantically to be gone
from a beam of micro-waves whose pattern
was not fixed which varied unpredictablv
from instant to instant as sound waves
changed it from something the white-spot
being could disregard to something which
did not promise food and which could not
be ignored

the white-spot creature was tormented

its instincts said that what was not pat-
terned was life its intelligence said that
this was not life-not life in quantity pro-
portional to the stimulus it yielded any-
how the modulated micro-waves im-
pressed its consciousness as a steam whistle
at his ear impresses a man the sensation
was intolerable it was maddening

  in less than an hour borden had re-
turned to the end of the valley and was
beaming micro-waves at the white spot
across the few miles of desert in between
he was beginning to be weary now and his
memory for recitative verse was running
thin

  take over and keep talking ellen he
said into the microphone he handed it
to her

  ellen said steadily i dont know how
this is doing what it does but-my name
is john wellington wells im a dealer in
magic and spells in hexes and curses and
ever-filled purses and witches and crickets
and elves ive got this wrong somehow
dee but tell me what it is and ill try to
keep on

  borden said id rather not tell you it
would overhear i think though that its
moving away the white stuff is drawing
back

  and it was true the whiteness which
had been beyond the desert was withdraw-
ing the pseudopod-a misnomer because
in this case the word should have been
something else-the extension which had
come to destroy the humans had long since
withdrawn the formless ground-covering
was gathering itself into a mass and that
mass was moving away

  there was a dark space visible it was
ground-humus oasis soil-which had been
covered by the unspeakable organism which
centuries since had conquered this planet

  id chase it borden said somberly
only im not sure it couldnt get itself to-
gether and make a sun-mirror well wait
till nightfall

  but what are we doing to it de-
manded ellen

jerry was at the microphone now go-
ing through the sonnets from the
portugese while the living jelly at the edge
of the world quivered and fled in shaking
revulsion
	startling stories

  the things alive said borden and
it cant help receiving all sorts of impres-
sions like any other organism it learns
to disregard any impression it receives
that it can anticipate or classify we dont
hear a clock ticking if we live near a
noisy street we dont hear traffic but we
wake if a door squeaks that-white spot
can disregard the electric waves of light-
ning it can disregard sunshine but it
cant disregard things it cant fit into a
pattern it has to pay attention and im
giving it the kind of unpattemed signals 
that normally mean living things con-
tinuous nonrepeat patterns of stimulation
and-theyre too strong for the devilish
thing

  ellen said doubtfully too strong
  you touch people to call their attention

if you touch them too hard it isnt a touch
but a blow and you can knock them
down thats what im giving this thing

it has the quality of a signal the spot cant
ignore and the force of a blow it should
have the psychological effect of thousands
of bells of intolerable volume-only worse
but weve got to keep on with the stimulus
and we mustnt repeat or it might be able
to get used to the pattern

  ill talk to it in french said ellen
but it doesnt seem to me that a walkie-
talkie could be too strong for-

  its hooked to the cars power system
borden told her jerry set it up and con-
nected it just before lie began to recite
poetry there are several kilowatts of
radiation going to the thing now and all
of it is attention-holding radiation

  when night fell and the use of a sun-
mirror was patently impossible borden
moved on the highway toward what had
been the white sjxrt the walkie-talkie
sent on its waves ahead

  ellen recited la fourmi et la cigale
from second-year french borden was
more or less ready to take on from there
with what he remembered of shakespeare

  they reached the end of the desert and
all about them there was the moist ground
of the oasis which once had been the
center of a civilization presently they
moved into the deserted emptied buildings
of a city

  borden said this civilization will be
worth studying

  they went on and on and on tatking
endlessly and driving die entity which had
conquered a planet by painstakingly re-
called sections of mother goose and by
haphazard recollections of ancient history
the mythology of ancient greece and rome
and the care and feeding of domestic cats

  when dawn came borden was speak-
ing rather hoarsely into the microphone
and the creature was plainly in sight before
them it writhed and struggled spasmodi-
cally it flung masses of itself insanely
about it knitted itself into intricate spires
and pinnacles with far-flung bridges which
shuddered and dissolved

the sun rose atjd the thing should
have been able to destroy them but it
could not it still writhed it still shud-
dered it twisted in monstrous weary
lunatic gyrations ellen regarded it with
eyes of loathing

  it acts like its gone mad she said in
revulsion

  it may have said borden its cer-
tainly exhausted but were getting pretty
tired too he said into the microphone
you probably dont understand this that
im saying any more then you understand
any of the rest but you had this coming
to you

  he handed the microphone to jerry who
had suddenly remembered an oration
spartacus to the gladiators jerry began to
recite it

  but the writhings of the mountainous
mass of jelly became more terribly weary
more quiveringly effortful there came a
time when it quivered only very very
faintly those quiverings ceased

  i think its dead sir said jerry

  borden snapped off the walkie-talkie
he snapped it on again the horrible half-
cubic-mile of jelly did not flinch

  borden said drily abracadabra hocus
pocus e pluribus unum

  there was no sign of life in the thing
he watched grimly for any sign of return-
ing activity by noon though it could be
seen that the ghastly mass of once-living
substance was changing it was liquefying
there were rills of an unpleasant fluid
forming on its glossy flanks to run down
and flow and flow away into the desert to
be dried up
white

  i dont think well want to be around
for the next few weeks borden said
heavily well go back and fix up the
ship

  then ellen mentioned sattells name for
the first time in days

  how about sattell

  we outran him on the way here
borden said moodily but i think hell
come on hell want to find out if were
dead not knowing what the thing-the
white spot-was i think hell figure that
either well be sent back with help or
killed if he gets to where he can see the
whitespot and we havent started back
with friends hell be sure were dead then
hell go back and start to fix up the ship
himself i think well meet him on the
way

  and they did the second day out from
what was now an oasis instead of a white
spot they saw sattells car headed in their
direction as a moving gleam of golden re-
flected sunlight

   jerry ran their car off the road to a hid-
ing-place behind a dune he and borden
took posts behind the sand dunes tip sat-
tell came racing at a hundred and fifty
miles an hour raising a long plume of
sand dust behind him

  borden and jerry fired together-two
thin pencil rods of flame from the golden-
metal weapons sattells ground car ran
past them crossing the highway just a
foot from the rock the treads of the car
disintegrated the car sped on slid and
rolled clumsily three separate times then
it stopped

  the oval side window turned and sattell
came crawling out he had a golden-metal
weapon now he must have searched fever-
ishly in the shambles of one of the two forts
to find a weapon that still would operate
he swung it frenziedly in their direction
he ran toward them screaming hate he
stumbled

  his weapon was firing but the fire was

spot	

short he fell on it into its flame

  and the ships log and the star maps
were in the ground car borden and jerry
had disabled

it was more than a month later when
the danac completely overhauled and
refueled and with the product of ellens
agriculture stored carefully away hovered
cautiously over what had been the white
spot at last they descended into the cen-
tral square of the city that once had been
the center of a civilization

   the three of them spent a day examining
that city they found things they could
not understand and things at which they
smiled and things that were quite marvel-
ous every civilization makes some discov-
eries that others miss and misses some that
others take for granted there would be
useful items in this civilization when hu- 
mans landed here and examined the re-
mains

   i think ellen said to borden that
you mean to come back

   borden nodded frowning a little

  no rational natives he said and
eighteen thousand square miles of oasis
it would make a rather wonderful place in
which to live-with that city and that civil-
ization to study will you mind

  ellen laughed she held out her hand
there were capsules in it

  ive been planting more seeds she
said so therell be earth-type vegetation
here when we get back

  and jerry 

   jerry said bashfully theres a girl   
if i can organize a group to make a settle-
ment here i think ill be back

  then well be back said borden
and next time well bring some of our
furry friends down from the ice-cap and
really find out what it means to settle down
and live here

   and then the danac climbed for the stars
and started back home

touch the sky

by alfbed coppel

the infinite may be beautiful but it has its limits   

the sign said ride the rock-
et twice around the uni-
verse for  which was cheap
enough pete moore thought cheap
enough at twice the fare

  glory giggled and pulled at his arm
lets ride pete lets see what youre in
for	

 

  he smiled down at her thinly because
it wasnt really anything for her to giggle
about but that was glory for you she
was young enough gay enough to be able
to make a joke of it and that was good and
he shouldnt spoil it not many other wives
would feel like that not many other wives
would want to spend his last night home on
touch the sky	

the midway for that matter but then again
that was glory

  me listened to the tinny carousel music
and the babble of the crowd the laughter
and the mingled drone of barkers he
smelled the tang of roasting popcorn and
the hot-doggy stink of the lunchcounters
he looked at the ferris wheel and the crazy
swoop of lights that was the scenic railway
and the people crowding along the board-
walk with kewpie dolls and spun-sugar
candy cones in their hands

  question his mind demanded is this
reality

  answer of course what else

  ive been too long away from cities he
thought too many silent nights in the des-
ert too many high flights in cold blue air
too long away from glory

  he felt guilty and depressed at the
thought it wasnt the way for a man to
feel not before the great adventure still
he couldnt avoid an almost homesick long-
ing for the deep darkness of the desert
and the silver ship waiting there

  soon he thought three days  three days
and a few hours

  he felt a tug at his arm

  pete glory was smiling up at him
half-aggrieved half-loving he looked again
at the garishlv painted sign

 ride the rocket

  lets ride it pete glory said lets

  there was something in her smile that
touched him pride that and love and
youth to her he was the man for her
and for all the world the one who was
going to reach out beyond the far horizon
and touch the sky and bring back a pot
of gold for everyone

  she thinks no one else could do it he
told himself thats love there were a doz-
en qualified men and yet-

  the moonshot was his

 ride thf rocket

  all right baby he said

  as he paid their fare for the rucket-ride
pete found himself looking at the girl in the
booth tired eyes and stringy hennaed hair
no dreams there he had an impulse to
tell her that soon hed really be riding the
rocket and that from then on things would
be different

  new frontiers and new dreams for ev-
erybody up and up

the girls eyes met his and it was
pete who looked away you dont talk
frontiers to pale worn faces and eyes
bleached of color by tinny music and stinks
and men

  they walked up a wooden ramp to where
a little metal bullet on rails waited the
paint once bright was all seuffv a sour-
faced attendant in grayish coveralls stood
by a large lever

  fasten ya seat belts mac

  were off to the sky glory said

  somewhere old machinery wheezed

  the little bullet began to move along the
rails toward a hinged trap-door in a wall
painted to look like clouds

  hold my hand pete glory said breath-
lessly

  glorv glory he thought young and
simple and in love with life any kind of life
real or unreal glory with a bubbling laugh-
ter a zest a faith maybe it was really for
her that he was taking the big flight if
only he could bring lack the pot of gold
if only he could tell weary man that the
sky was all his he thought of the strained
unhappy faces in the streets the fear-filled
eyes if he could-return and say to them
heres your new frontier yes by god
it was worth the work and the risk glory
was right it was something to be proud of

  im going to the moon

  me pete moore to the moon

  there it is pete

  they had bumped through the painted
door into a musty semi-darkness the walls
were perforated with holes for stars and
from somewhere below a huge yellowish
moon was rising

  off a short way to the right was a glow-
ing papier-mache globe painted with broad
bands slightly askew and behind that was
another with rings

  a loudspeaker whistled tinnily and over-
head on wire runners an electric glole
crossed the dim chamber pieces of yellow
and white crepe paper fluttering feebly lie-
hind

  oh pete a comet

  sure enough glory he said

  the rumbling little bullet skirted the
walls and pete could see the electric lights
behind the holes stars he thought sar-
donically close enough to touch lucky us

  theres mars pete glory said


startling stories

squeezing his hand

   im getting disenchanted he thought

  a red ball all painted with canals and
white polar caps far too big

  they should have had a technical ad-
visor on this project he thought paging
palomar

   the bullet began its second circuit of the
papier-mache universe and the moon was
high now projected on the wall by some
kind of lantern-slide lamp there was a
face on the moon

  it began then-just a tiny bead of fear
way down inside his belly but it grew
he felt suffocated claustrophobic op-
pressed by fakery and cheapness

   glory was laughing with delight oh its
wonderful

  shut up pete thought savagely shut
up shut up

   with an effort he got hold of himself

  ive been working too hard im jittery
thinking about the moonshot and all this
seedy burlesque just irritates me theres
nothing to get heated up about calm down

  but why am i suddenly afraid

  he looked again at the ridiculous moon
with its smirking face he saw that plaster
had fallen from the wall in places peeling
away leaving the bare hexagons of wire
and laths

  my god he thought a chickenwire sky

   he thought again of the girl in the ticket
booth and of the tired frightened people
all laughing too much and shoving and
running outside

  the bullet started down at last toward
the hinged door on this side it was painted
to look like earth with a distorted map
of north america all wrong somehow

  pete felt ill it was as though someone
were making ill-tempered fun of the dreams
and the tall silver ship waiting out on the
desert cheapening it laughing nastily

  the little bullet bumped through the
seedy scruffy earth and out into the night
of the midway out into the crowd-sounds
and music and hot-doggy smells

  it was fun pete glory said

  he helped her out onto the rickety plat-
form he had the insane notion that the
girl in the ticket booth and the lounging
attendant were laughing at him

  it sure was honey he said wearily
still feeling the illogical fear of he-knew-not-
what inside himself real fun

  glory looked up at him eyes alight and
almost feverishly gay i did what you are
going to do i touched the sky

new frontiers new lands in the
sky new hope

  it was quiet the jet was still and no
sound was anywhere in the ship now a
soft tick from the timer a whisper from
the questing radarscope and again the
stillness

  weve done it pete thought weve really
done it the hard part is over

  ride the rocket

  he remembered the pain of the takeoff
and the absolute panic that had welled up
in him when the irrevocability of his action
came home he remembered riding a tail
of red fire up out of the hot desert air
of new mexico into the still blue and
then the silence and the almost unnerving
thrill of the realization that the moonshot
was going to succeed

  the radio hissed at him with the voice
of the desert base half around the world

  hello moonshot this is base alls
okay stage one landed in the gulf stage
two just reported floating off the azores
good show

  pete lifted himself from the acceleration
couch and felt a moment of nausea and
panic as he floated toward the ceiling of the
tiny cell free flight he steadied himself
and checked the flow of telemetered infor-
mation binding the ship to the glowing
curve far below all okay except that-

  except that youre still afraid he told
himself not just the normal fear-of-falling-
afraid that the psychs told you about afraid
like before-in that silly damn carnival ride
thing

  afraid of the dark

  no not quite that more a closed in
cheated feeling

  premonition nonsense

  he clung to the radarscope trembling
with every rushing mile upward outward
his fear was growing it wasnt right it
didnt make sense but he felt as though
he were rushing straight at a brick wall
head down eyes closed

   he lit the telescreens

  the stars look funny he thought un-
easily

  the timer ticked the radar whispered
searching time passed and his fear grew
touch the sky



thicker less reasonable

  his fingers dug hard at the metal of the
instrument panel as the night slipped by
outside the hull the ships orbital elipse
keplers contribution to the new frontier
was established

  pete thought somethings wrong very
wrong the stars look queer

  the constellations in the telescreens were
distorting and there was something ahead
of the ship where there should be nothing
but emptiness it showed in the screen for
just an instant and was lost a ringed
sphere

  i must be dreaming pete thought but
then what is reality that sphere was sat-
urn and it was a hundred yards across

  reality insanity

  id better check with base pete thought
and tell them ive gone off my rocker that
im suffering hallucinations

  but he did nothing except cling shaking
to the panel watching the distorted stars
in the screen they were blurring now
streaks of light that seemed to be very close
to the ship

and then came the moon it came
and went very quickly pocked and
scarred and with only one face and small
very small and very close

  pete felt closed in suffocated the radar
alarm was screaming at him that something
was near too near

  he clamped down savagely on himself
there was an explanation somewhere he
had to find it he had to think

  item the stars distorted blurred
item saturn a hundred yards across
item a tiny replica of the moon like a
pimple on the inside of an egg

  replica no the moon the only moon
reality

  hypothesis say that space is not as men
imagined it say that it is an illusion with-
out lightyears without great suns without
huge planets say for the sake of argument
that it is a shell with holes in it and light
outside and the sun itself an illusion of
heat and power and-

say that this hollow shell is mans new
frontier a fraud a toy for things outside-
the alarm screamed at him the ship
was plunging toward the blurry light of the
stars

  with an icy hand on his heart pete
moore turned to look at the telescreen be-
hind him a misty blue ball swam in musty
darkness the oceans gleamed in the light
of the sun cloud masses whitened it the
wrinkled face of the land looked unreal-
he began to laugh tears streaked his
cheeks as he pounded his bloody fists against
the instrument panel in time to the clang-
ing of the alarm

  the earth the earth-

  it did rather look like papier-macw

  he touched the sky

xcerpt taken from the his-
tory of trial proce-
dure  to  ad written by
prof a i schule sed

  even then in the beginning of the
twenty-third century crime per se it-
self had ceased to exist the lower emo-
tions had already been bred out of the
people envy hate avarice and kindred
the thirteenth juror



responses were virtually non-existent
every citizen had a crude type of emo-
tiograph attached to his person which
was examined periodically by the eye
if any deviation from the norm was ob-
served the accused was called up for
questioning

  in the absence of actual crime any
emotion which might have precipitated
crime was considered unlawful and
men were tried for too much anger or
too little pity the only purpose of a
trial was to ascertain whether sufficient
provocation could be established to war-
rant a given reaction if the cause or
the incidentjustified the emotional re-
sponse the defendant was exculpated

  trial procedure was extremely sim-
ple the use of the witness was obso-
lete above the defendants box was a
concentric screen upon which his
thoughts could be projected the ques-
tioner would channel the thoughts of the
accused into whatever date periods were
pertinent and in that way the defend-
ant reviewed his own case

  it is into this category that the cele-
brated and very controversial john
hastings case falls you all remember
that of course as the cause celebre of
the year  ad

  no amer sec book two p 

one night they watched a column of
flame lift a silver speck into the sky
and one night much later they heard
a voice call into space saying come
back john hastings come back

  our inspection has shown serious
deviations in your emotiograph you
will turn your rocket and rechart for
earth john hastings for trial john
hastings

  and they came to the trial out of
the ripe wet hills down from the blis-
tering dome over the city up through
the shafts of the gritty substructure
they came and stood in lines wiping the
august sweat from their eyes littering
the levels with orange peels as they ate
women with babies strapped to their
shoulders and suppers left unradiated on
the cooker men with lead-shielded faces
and tools laid aside in the middle of a
movement but they came and stood

and jostled one another milling and
gossiping

  gonna be some trial

        might even resort to electrocu-
tion

  naw thats dark time methods

  oh yeah

  oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah   

  but they felt good the people for it
wasnt their trial the words could come
easy and undammed for it was john
hastings who was on trial they could
look at him all they wanted to and talk

  and then suddenly they could look
at me too because i was called as the
thirteenth juror on the john hastings
trial

i walked into it after a night that
held no sleep and looked at it the
yawning amphitheatre where humanity
poured and saw it the thirteen chairs
raised high in the center and heard it
the crowds susurrus gentling under in-
sistent reminders from a bodiless ques-
tioner

  i glanced at the faces in the other
twelve boxes recognizing some of them
angus vortler the psychosurgeon wil-
liam bax head of intergalactic a bleak
wintery man who doodled constantly
dollar signs probably fred kitson of
the horny palms chief mechanic on the
darkness all men who because they
had once reached out and touched hands
with john hastings were now called to
judge him several of them nodded to
me as i took my place

  wait

  they brought him in i remembered
the first time i had ever seen him in
the classroom eager and tall    tall and
eager lord what changed him some-
thing had taken the straightness from
his shoulders the -sureness from his
stride there were furrows on his face
where the tears had already been

  he stood silently in the box where
they had-put him a box just big enough
for his bulky xdy and maybe a little of
the misery he carried with him

  a voice spoke

  this john hastings is your trial
you stand before this court of truth-
probity accused of registering the eino-
	startling stories

tion of hate a hatred so violent that
had we permitted you to carry out your
anticipated actions it would have result-
ed in the murder of one mary hastings
your wife do you understand the
charge 

  i do he didnt know what to do
with his hands

  how do you plead

  i plead not guilty

  on what ground asked the voice
the defendant raised his head on
the ground that i had good and sufficient
reason to justifymy emotion

  the reactographs on your wife
mary hastings have been thoroughly
examined and it has been determined
that she performed no act which in any
way deviated from the norm had any
disturbances taken place within mary
hastings during the week of last march
ninth to sixteenth it would have shown
up plainly in a flux on the charts your
contention is impossible

  the man in the box bit his lip nev-
ertheless i contend it my wife gave me
sufficient reason she-she was unfaith-
ful to me

   only silence for a full mifmte

  it is impossible

  but true hastings shouted

  the multitude leaned forward a mist-
ed inquiry rustling its skirts

  very well the voice- almost sighed
will you submit captain hastings to
the use of the concentric screen we
wish to know more of the circumstances
surrounding several pertinent dates
his face was the color of picked bones
yes i will submit

  two men advanced carrying a mesh
complexity between them placing it
over the defendants head they allowed it
to fall to his shoulders

  are you ready john hastings
yes it seemed he was already gone
from the place

  then concentrate remember permit
your mind to have freedom the voice
washed over him in waves it is a day
in december    the fourteenth   
take my words and let them carry
you

  the screen alove the defendants
head began to cloud and draw in

  it is cold outside    the snow is
falling there is a warm room a fire is
burning   

  the mists opalesced and formed a
nucleus

  there is a pool of light on the desk
unexpected flowers in a bowl the odor
of duck roasted brown  

  something was struggling for ex-
istence in the screen

  there is a brown-haired woman-
  and the image was born   

she bent over a card candlelight
best service for two white wine
celebration atmosphere she wrote and
put it into the dining table selector
somewhere an orchestra started playing
debussy

  john she called almost ready

  a card shot back at her from the mir-
ror as she passed your nose is shiny
it read she powdered quickly taming
wisps of hair as an afterthought

  any further comments she wanted
to know and held out her hand a sec-
ond card appeared i cant whistle

  her laughter brimmed over laced in
delight john dinners ready

  she called into three rooms empty
rooms crossing to the terrace she
opened a door on the night snowflakes
rode in on an icy draft

- well

  john what are you doing out there 
i cant even see you

  that seems to be one of your habits
recently

  she drew him inside and leaned
against the door closing is it going
to be like that tonight

  maybe his face was steeped in
cold

please not the day before you go
the white crystals on his hair melted
into drops and a sudden warmth strained
all harshness from his voice no youre
right mary not the day before i go

  pushing him toward the fire mary
took hiscloak didnt you notice
what

  the table silly its happy home-
coming tonight

  leavestaking you mean

  no homecoming its not december
the thirteenth juror	

its august youve just opened the
front door and said mary im home
and all the time in between hasnt been
it never will be

  he smiled for the first time

  now thats better

  the woman handed john hastings a
goblet plump with yellow liquid to
august dear she said and raised her
glass to the moment your foot touches
earth again and to the wine    warm
and golden like our life together
lets eat he said lets not ask
questions he faltered-in a lack of di-
rection

  wait a minute

  for what

  for the questions you cant ask
the gaiety was gone it was real now
i think its time we swept out the cor-
ners

  john nodded his face slack

  youve been strange lately

  oh that he shrugged lets say
its the getting ready  the heart plunge
just before you jump into space
no it was definite its more
than that youve been a rocket man all
your life you dont get nervous any
more

  his fingers twisted the glass some-
thing else twisted his voice there are
things in it that might make a man nerv-
ous mary black winds burning
worlds holes in space waiting for him
you think it might be that mary
no

  but this is alpha centauri this is
faster-than-light he bowed this is
when baby-god hastings tests his brain
child    when the electron lightscope
goes to bat you think it might be that
mary

  dont make nasty fun

her husband regarded her a long
serious moment no youre right
again leaning in to her he spoke
softly did you know mary that it
isnt the big things that make a man
nervous any more  only the little
things-

  say it she insisted get it out
youllfeel better

  he hadnt moved just the very little

things a supper unradiated an empty
wrap hanger an unfilled chair empti-
ness where there should be something
where has there been emptiness
mary was surprised

  between us

  oh darling    that just isnt so
isnt it he took her hands cards
on the table mary right

  right

  youve been going to meetings for
the last month

  its my turn on the committee
  youve been out late quite a bit

  i cant leave till they check me
out   

  there have been other people there
she pulled her hands away and es-
caped to the other side of the room
lots of them

  but there was one face in particular
oh there was a finality in it
who told you

  does that matter his hand waved
it aside why didnt you tell me charles
lathrop was on the committee with
you 

  because i knew how youd feel in-
stantly she was at his side oh darling
dont you suppose i know what you
think youve never accepted the fact
that when i married you my feeling
for him was over and done

  is that true

  yes yes yes cant you understand
what i felt for him four or five years
ago was that young thing everyone goes
through

  young things grow great oaks   
not this one when you came it was
over is over

  he shook his head and passed his
hand over his face god knows i want
to believe that youre my wife mary i
love every bit of you but lathrop keeps
bobbing up

  the fire crackled like dry leaves
rouging the unhappy walls there are
more questions she wanted to know
yes

  ask them

  did you know he was going to be
on the committee

  of course not

forgive me mary but-but have


startling stories

you spent any extra time with him
oh john we talk at the meetings
-hello-its a roaring day-have you
heard the latest about ganymede  
thats all

   i swear

  you dont feel anything
nothing absolutely nothing hes a
friend a brother a comfortable dog
the stiffness went out of hastings
he sank back breathing hard as if he
had been running too fast mary you
dont know how good that hears you
just dont know

  oh my darling she held his head
in her arms her mouth close to his ear
has it been this all these months
the man nodded mughing a little i
just couldnt take the thought that
maybe-

  hush hush dont even say it any
more drink the wine and remember
what i said    to its warm glow like
our home together 

   his hand reached out and trembling
slightly the fingers grasped and fum-
bled and clutched at air the glass shat-
tered prettily spilling its golden life on
the unalterable stone throat of the hearth

   and they stood there hands untouch-
ing watching the glistening fragments
trap the last warm glow of the fire

enough enough a voice said
you will rechannel your thoughts
captain hastings there is another day
in time

  the screen misted and the veils
swirled

   march eleventh  on a ship  a
glazed splinter in blackness   

   the curtains quivered

  men gather tight against the void
 a clarinet wails    there is the smell
of sweat  

  kitson and holmes were doing a
dance they had their breechskins rolled
over their knees and four grapefruit
tied to their fronts

   take it off    take it off    take it
off the men rode a ground swell of
tinny music rhythm stamped out in the
pattern of magnetic boots fought with
the sucking sound of beer cans the air
curled with smoke

  above their heads a hatch opened and
the captains legs appeared descending
ladderwise abruptly the melee subsid-
ed into leftover clarinet tones

  mr kitson

  kitson brought himself to attention
his grapefruit swinging sir

  ive been informed there was news
from home the men looked at one an-
other

  only the broadcast from the sector
sir nothing unusual

  you took it down on the tapes
  yes sir

  i should like to hear it from one
corner a reluctant shuffling replaced the
lately dead downbeats the reproducer
scratched badly

   at a banquet given for members
of the committee prominent among the
guests was mrs mary a hastings wife
of captain john hastings who is making
history in his ftl flight to alpha cen-
tauri captain hastings will test his in-
vention the electron-lightscope from
our neighboring sun ft is reliably re-
ported that the lightscope will revolu-
tionize astral observation in that it will
replace the telescope and will bring dis-
tant galaxies to within a few hundred
feet of the earth

  mrs hastings smartly gowned was
seated next to co-ordinator charles
lathrop who had-

  someone jostled into the machine
the groove was lost

  hastings spoke slowly id like to
hear the rest of it

  kitson was carefully unrolling his
breechskins

  id like to hear the rest of it i said
  yes sir someone murmured

     was seated next to charles
lathrop who had escorted her to the
banquet in the absence of the captain
they danced frequently to the strains of
the deimos orchestra which was rocket-
ed here for the pro-

  thats enough said hastings star-
ing whitely

  the mechanic took two steps toward
him is something wrong sir you
look ill

  not at all mr kitson not at all
his eyes snapped back to the man in
the thirteenth juror	

front of him astraddle a newborn idea
i was merely considering peeping
toms mr kitson

  beg pardon sir

  peeping toms never heard of them
have you 

  no sir i dont think any of us have
what a pity a most fascinating sub-
ject found in a twentieth century his-
tory of the minor vices

  yes sir

  you display no curiosity mr kit-
son his eyebrows raised in this you
differ significantly from our peeping
tom he wanted to know a great many
things and he settled the whole matter
with a pair of binoculars his voice
sounded like scraped stone yes indeed
-a pair of binoculars

  im afraid i wasnt subjected to that
facet of knowledge indoctrination sir
kitson shrugged imperceptibly when
the captain got like this-his shoulders
spoke for him

  hastings had caught the movement
however you find my words unin-
structive 

  no sir-i mean-

  very well something was growing
big in the man since you view your
deficiencies so lightly you may report
for punishment duty in the morning
but sir i only said-

  that will be all mr kitson has-
tings climbed the ladder an ear split-
ting silence hurrying him upward his
face appeared through the hatch a face
withdrawn behind vacant eyes ready to
crumble remember kitson ill see
you topside tomorrow you will en-
deavor to compensate for this most re-
grettable omission in your education
while i-i will contemplate the advan-
tages of twentieth century sins

  the hatch closed

  everyone was suddenly very busy
holmes picked up empty beer contain-
ers and threw them into the deatomizer
a big sandy man laced and unlaced the
binding-pad on his bunk kitson sat
down and stared vacantly

  after three or four minutes he said
something

  the sonovagun he said the poor
poor sonovagun

impersonal words broke into the
dream we have seen it is suf-
ficient the screen flickered and grew
dim can you stand further probing
captain may we proceed

  yes

  there is yet one more time -march
fifteenth

  i remember

  then relax    drift there are two
men they hang above a yellow sun   
space sleeps at their feet  

  an image formed and wavered and
formed again

  their words are whispered    they
speak softly in the presence of immen-
sity   

  it crystallized   

  im asking as vortler your friend
not vortler the psychosurgeon

  side by side they sat in the tattered
light of the observation hull centauri
lay less than one day ahead it dangled
like a full blush peach their silhouette
its only bruised spot rockets hummed

  theres no use asking any more ques-
tions angus the time for questions is
past this is exams

  thats what i mean john refharks
like that youve gotten to be a man who
talks to himself

  hastings sat without moving a muscle
what did the men tell you 

  nothing actually the other made
a nasty sound no thats true i didnt
need them ive seen it for myself this
entire trip

  and how do you diagnose it doc-
tor a whisky bottle gleamed in the
light of the creamy sun

  just like that he wants it in two or
three words where t need books where
freud took volumes he wants it in two
or three words

  and the doctor doesnt have them
john said angus shook his head but
i do he poured from the bottle shes
seeing charles

  vortler snorted youre mistaken
no im not ive thought about her
a lot these last three months and i think
i know her now he leaned his head
back and shut his eyes shes an august
woman angus an august woman one
night a warm breeze comes through the
	startling stories

door and sweeps a girl into your arms
you say things and she says things and
you both end up saying i do then she
wakes up one morning to find she
doesnt any more and another door will
open another breeze carry her off
marys not like that

  i didnt think so in the beginning
you surprise me john i thought
you had more faith

  not any more with me its what i
can touch or smell or hear or see noth-
ing more

  then theres never an proof for you
you cant watch her every minute
john raised himself unsteadily and
stitched his finger into the air that
my dear doctor is where you are
wrong he stood and groped his way
into the light of the cabin angus fol-
lowed trying to see his face

  there is sonfething more to this
john lets stop the riddles and say
what we mean

  the captain spun in sharp stifled an-
ger shall i tell you angus shall i
let you in on my secret the anger
detonated all right damn it you
came here for it ill give it to you you
know my lightscope well it works it
works fine

  what has this-

  do you know what johnny-boy has
been doing with the blasted thing he
cried ive been using it to play in-
quirer ive been using it to spy on my
wife

  the doctors jaw dropped you have
what

  thats right night after night ive
come back here ive set up the god-
daiumed thing-and ive scanned
this is incredible

  three night ago i found new york
two nights ago i co-ordinated to the
hudson river last night i got as far
as the third level tonight- his arms
swept a circle-east lynne

  vortlers hand smashed down its

fot to stop theres no reason for this
wont permit it

  what can you do its my light-
scope-my ship my orders supersede
yours

  vortler closed the space between them

his fists knobbed white john laughed
dont overdo it angus im not worth
it the sound died to a chuckle be-
sides remember your emotiograph
somebody will spank

  the doctors hands opened slowly a
finger at a time

  tell me angus can you honestly
blame me i suspect my wife im trying
to find out

  but youre wrong

it could be the thing is possible
he leaned toward the psychosurgeon
you think about it and tell me its
possible

  vortler looked defeated

  yes

  and thats that

  angus started for the barway i
dont know what started this thing off
john perhaps if a man loves his wife a
little too much a thing like this can
happen maybe thats why theyve
watched our charts so carefully
hastings was already talking to him-
self if i can just prove it one way or
the other if i can just know shes-
alone

  the white clad figure paused think
it over john change your mind i dont
like any part-of it

  angus john said softly t dont
like it either i dont want the sight of
mary on that lens to leave what print
a dream smashed a dishonor who
knows

  the doctor shook his head look out
the viewplate john what do you see
planet systems galaxies eons what is
one tiny less-than-a-mite in all of that
what docs it mean to you the mind of
the almighty-or a few cents worth of
bone and hair and tissue ask your-
self john what do you see

  he closed the barway behind him
john followed and threw the pressure
lock going to a sleek instrument his
hands inquired softly along its lines
cold as space sure doubt proof he
swept the litter from his desk and set
the instrument in its center levers spun
mirrors sent out chips of light adjusters
adjusted

  then pausing he moved to the view-
plate and stood looking out a long time
the thirteenth juror



his hands mangled themselves constant-
ly behind his back a star twinkled-one
star in particular-as if through the
prism of a cold tear	f

  but he went back to the instrument
and bent to it slowly and as he gripped
the desk his knuckles erupted pale as
washed gravestones   

  and the graph lines shivered and
glowed hot and the hate came pouring
out of the shining needle between the
stars and somewhere a voice called into
space 	

come back john hastings come
back the questioner said you
may return to the present

  throbbing the screen died as a stir-
ring exhalation came from the crowd
someone asked for more air a baby
cried and was lulled to sleep

  we have seen the pictures captain
hastings and we accept them the facts
were presented as they happened it is
unfortunate that we can show no evi-
dence of what reached john hastings
eye as he looked into the electron-light-
scope mechanical tabulations cannot be
transmitted to our screen since its en-
visioning powers are limited to the sen-
sory memory patterns of the brain we
must therefore go to the defendant him-
self for further evidence

  they had removed the heavy mesh
but the captains head remained bowed

  do you swear john hastings that
by the power of the god whom we know
to be and by the strength of your own
mind you will tell us what you saw in
that instrument

  i do so swear

  you may proceed

  he drew himself together i found
her at her mothers house even though
its vacant now she liked to go back
there occasionally when i was away
the twelve other jurors were leaning
forward in their boxes i could feel my
body itching from the strain

  you located her at her mothers
house at ah on the third level
eighty-first sector west of the hud-
son 

  i did

  continue

  she was sitting on the lawn in front
of the house talking to a man his back
was toward me

  you could not see his face

  not then

  go on

  they talked for a while then he
moved to her on the grass she smiled
and they put their arms around one an-
other he kissed her

  what happened then

  he lifted her to her feet and i saw
it was charles lathrop they went to
the door and she opened it he found
it hard to get the words past his lips
please proceed

  when she got inside she turned
around and smiled it looked as if she
was laughing at me then she reached
out and touched his arm she-she-
please speak louder she what
she took him inside and shut the
door

  heaped silence greeted the words
men turned quietly and gazed at their
wives their eyes asking a question for
the bewildered the undecided

  john hastings we have checked
thoroughly your wife did spend the
night of the fifteenth in the vacant house
of which you speak she spent the night
however alone her graphs show no dis-
turbances no emotional exhilaration
you are perpetrating an untruth

  im not i saw it i saw it as plainly
as i can see the box in which i am stand-
ing now

  you could not have seen it

  before my god i did i saw every
detail the yellow pannier she wore
the blue hydrangea bush on the lawn
that broken aneroid beside the door
every detail his voice crescendoed

  it is impossible

he raised his fists in the air say
its impossible if you like repeat it
a thousand times but i saw her do it
just the same i saw it

  something inside me had pulled tight
thoughts of the classroom flooded into
my mind long forgotten formulae theo
ries    somewhere the voice droned
on charging the jurors

  -having reviewed the evidence-
	startling stories

  i kept groping toward a page in a
book somewhere there was a piece that
would fit in the majority ballot rules
it was going too fast for me they were
calling for the vote

  juror number one please stand and
tell the court how do you find

  with great deliberation he turned his
back on the defendant in the box

  juror number one designates guilt
juror number two how do you find
vortler was second he stood and
gazed at john hastings for a long mo-
ment then he raised his arms toward
the defendant palms upward

  juror number two designates inno-
cence

  i went back to the classroom again
and again there was a thing waiting
there for me but it had been so long
ago

  the count was going fast   

 juror number six how do you
find bax i knew his vote before he
cast it he turned his back

  where did it stand now  four guilty
two innocent

  my heart began to pound it felt as
if i were standing on the edge of a deep
water where was it that i groped after 
i tried to shut myself in and think

  the semi-circle was almost complet-
ed the voice had reached the juror on
my left six men stood with their backs
to john hastings five stood with their
arms outstretched juror number
twelve how do you find

  i asked for help then i asked the
lord to turn the pages and i asked
him to help kitson too kitson raised
his arms high the score was even

it waited until then to conife the
piece    the little piece falling on my
brain from that half-forgotten book
juror number thirteen how do--
mr questioner i cried i would
like to interpose

  it is incorrect procedure to inter-
rupt the vote-

  yes yes i know my voice shook
but there is something i just remem-
bered something pertinent to what
john hastings saw

  can it prove anything further one
way or the other

  i think so

  an unseen conference very well
dispensation granted what is your in-
formation 

  i took a deep breath john hastings
viewed his wife on earth from one of
the planets of alpha centauri

  that is correct

  my tongue was dry my hands wet

  alpha centauri is four years four
months distant measuring in light years
therefore in his travel john hastings
lost three of those months but when he
turned his instrument backward he was
looking at light images which had started
from the earth long before he ever left
it he was looking at-

  at    zvhat happened jour years
ago    john hastings had finished
the sentence for me he was looking at
something as if it were the first sunrise
he had ever known

  speculation brought the amphithea-
tre to its feet for the only time during
the trial the mob found its voice un-
certainty relief and surprise mingled
ebbed and flowed

  the voice called for attention quiet
please quiet the information is cor-
rect and the storm was over

  since the jury is thus far hung we
will leave the decision to the last thir-
teenth talisman we would like your
vote juror thirteen how do you find 

  john looked at me it was the first
time since they had brought hiirtn

  and i stretched my arms out toward
him   

  who can say whether i was right or
wrong  it is too delicate a thing to come
out all white or all black but i think
that in order for a man to hate a woman
so very much it is also necessary for him
to have loved her very much too

  and sometimes i wake up shaking
in the night i am thinking of what might
have happened if i hadnt remembered
that old discarded pannier or the way
mother transplanted the blue hydrangea
bush before she died or how dad swore
when she made him throw that aneroid
away if i hadnt remembered those
things i would never have seen the look
on johns face as he walked into my out-
stretched arms and said is it time for
us to go home now mary is it

awakening

  a novelet by bryce walton

 perhaps humans cannot live

       without loving  but alice
 the android found she could

love without living   

illustration by
paul orban
           the scream of the commutor jet was bringing
           kelsey home broke like glass outside the house

                  startled alice realized that she was behind schedule in
               her household duties quickly she switched the news off
               the tevee master kelsey hated newscasts they made him
               uneasy particularly with all this talk about a possible air-
               raid

                 instead she hurriedly tuned in kelseys evening prefer-
               ence self-improvement commercials with the latest pop-
               tunes for background

                 then she ran into the bathroom to prepare kelseys in-
              tricate beauty ritual

                she turned up her thermostat so that her machinery
             would run a little faster if she wasnt careful master
	startling stories

kelsey would trade her in for a more mod-
ern and physically attractive domestic

  she heard footsteps in the hall his foot-
steps-

  in another few seconds he would be there
real breathing but unobtainable a living
dream something on the other side of the
looking glass

  oh the pain the indescribable pain of
love greater and deeper and drowning love
going out and out all the time and never
coming back again painful painful unre-
quited love

  the cumulative loneliness the hours of
lonely loving the hours and days and weeks
and years of tireless mechanical walking in
the indifferent round of the hours of her
life the loneliness of loving something that
can never love in return that doesnt even
know of your love that cant even con-
ceive of your being able to love

  for you are only a machine and your
soul can never be shared for only you
know that you have a soul and it is an acci-
dent and no one could even suspect that it
could possibly be-this crying hungry
yearning lonely soul

  without effort she could have cried out
her heart to master kelsey but she had
not been made to cry and no one would
think of looking for her heart or soul or
the lonely yearning of the heart or soul

  for the soul can be trapped in ugliness
or in the slashing streak of electrons dying
there the soul alone can mourn its dying
for who can feel the soul in the rectifiers
and diods or behind the ugliness of a dis-
torted shell

  i was very good for her she thought that
no one no human including master kelsey
could never guess at the awful intensity the
terrible hunger of the soul that kept loving
in silence alone in the dark behind the
plastoid walls of an inhuman shell

  master kelsey came into the living room
tall and broad and beautiful and neat in
his business suit his blond hair in a waving
shine but with that tired sharp look to his
mouth in spite of its frozen smile he al-
ways seemed so relieved to see her standing
there waiting responsive receptive an un-
derstanding shadow that filled up his fright-
ened loneliness between the time of his ar-
rival and the absorption in tevee or the
always demanded presence of guests

  he leaned wearily against the wall

breathing heavily as though he had been
running from something for a long time

  hello hello alice he said quickly
forcing exaggerated joy into the greeting
to conceal something full of fear

  hello master kelsey you had a fine
day at the office 

  fine it was great simply perfect he
said it almost fiercely as though even a
robot might challenge the statement

  as he stared at the tevees hypnotic glow
his face began to relax a little everybody
he whispered was happy today the man-
ager gave our office group a silver star
for being tops in the group sociability
scale for the week

  thats wonderful master kelsey

  he stared at her i wish they had made
you so yon could smile more alice the
way you look it-it gives me a sort of
doubtful feeling sometimes

  if you only knew how i felt my dearest
kelsey inside inside the machinery that
has the cold and tiny shell im all one
great warm smile of joy just to be near
you darling kelsey

  tm happy for you master kelsey she
said

  he nodded slowly

  why wasnt he happier she wondered
as she had wondered so many times before
he had all that anyone should need to be
happy in the first place he was human
among many others who were human and
then all the other things and the woman
the woman he loved gloria tonnencourt
the woman he loved loved loved-

  gloria was coming over to see him to-
night alice would have to watch it again
hear it again she would have to listen
again to love while she stood alone and
frozen in the dark closet of her own long-
ings

  alice

  yes

  its that ten minutes on the commutor
to the jet station dont they realize that
a man is alone those ten minutes nobody
else to talk to no tevee no sound even
alone

 he nodded he was asking her if
   she knew what loneliness was

  he started for the bathroom as though
to avoid thinking of something
everything ready for my love he
awakening	

asked nervously

  yes she said yes the robot says yes
my love everything is ready for your love

  good

  in the bathroom kelsey looked in the
full length mirror and alice watched him

  master kelsey the mirror said softly
critical youre not smiling

  but i am

  yes but not enough

  kelsey touched his lips and stretched his
face muscles the mirror said people are
uneasy when you dont smile

  alice knew how much kelsey respected
his mirror it had cost him so much and
it was the most popular item advertised
on tevee it was finely attuned to kelseys
personality it knew when he was not look-
ing exactly right to meet the strict demands
of the crowd

  smile and the group will love you the
mirror said frown and you may frown
alone

  kelsey was suddenly smiling intensely as
though his very life had been threatened

  thats better the mirror said

  alice had tried so hard and so often to
smile pulling at the plastoid stuff of her
face she guessed that humans were sup-
posed to smile all the time and robots
never why should a robot smile a robot
had nothing to sell it had routine functions
but it had nothing to sell

  kelsey zipped himself out of his clothes
and jumped into the shower he was six
feet tall he had blue eyes and wavy hair
with streaks of brown in the viking yellow
his skin was golden and his muscles
moved with fluid healthy power his daily
stint in the male beauty clinic at the factory
kept him in top condition and the mirror
was always alert to detect any flaw in his
outward appearance

  but who will love you when youre old
master kelsey when the gold turns gray
and the muscles shrink and the teeth decay
and the eyes turn pale and the body is bent
with the squeezing hands of time 

  let me stay darling kelsey let me stay
forever and ill love you when youre old

  seeing his strong naked beauty there she
felt her machinery pounding and the burn-
ing in her eyes it wasnt anything that
could be controlled by the thermostat she
needed his arms and the feel of his power
like a long wave her love came to her lips

in strange words childish words moist and
tender and unheard by master kelsey

  she turned away she looked at the blank-
ness of the wall please please let me be
careful if i am not careful i will be sent
away away where there is no kelsey away
where they will take my soul

  do you think gloria will like me mor
tonight than she did the last time she was
here alice

  im sure she will master kelsey

  the womans face on the tevee screen
covering one wall of the bathroom was a
kind of subtle threat alice thought

  are you sure youre exercising the maxi-
mum acceptability of which your personality
is capable do you sometimes feel that in
some intangible way you are offending your
friends the self-analysis personology
chart scale guarantees to dig out the most
hidden blocks to full and joyful acceptance
by others send for your personology chart
at once f 

  thats something new isnt it alice

  i believe it is master kelsey

  well put in an order put an order in
right now

  alice punched the order button on the
side of the wall next to the tevee screen
whatever item was being advertised at the
time the button was punched was automatic-
ally ordered the consumers name and ad-
dress recorded the price deducted from his
salary and an extra point added to his con-
sumers cooperative card for the year

  it was not only very important how many
items one ordered in a year but also the
kinds of items items that aided an employee
in being acceptable to the office group were
especially smiled upon by office managers
alice had always been careful to get in every
such order

  alice knew all about the system she
knew all about kelseys work she had lis-
tened to him talking about it endlessly
either to her or to others she had watched
kelsey rise from office boy to chief clerk
getting the glad reports of his progress ev-
ery evening she couldnt imagine anyone
at the office being more likeable than kel-
sey he was so human she had thought
so human-

  alice

  yes master kelsey

  did you ever find that paper

  she turned quickly she could feel fear


startling stories

  did they know that a robot could feel fear
  as well as love  could anyone or anything
  feel one without the other did they know
  that a robot at least this robot could feel
  fear at the idea of being labeled inefficient
  and being sent back to the factory and re-
  made rebuilt dismantled changed-and
   probably having a soul burned out that no
  one had ever known was there did they
  know that if a robot could feel love or fear
  that it could also steal deliberately steal and
  hide something

    you mean the paper from the office

    yes yes alice the order paper

    no she said she hesitated and said it
  again no

    im sure i brought it home well the
 only thing to do is mark it as lost and have
 another order made out tomorrow no real
 hurry i guess only one more receptionist to
 be replaced

 she had stolen it she had hidden it
 she would never never use it of course
 that would be impossible too risky too
 frightening even to think about actually do-
 ing but it was there to dream about she
 was good at dreaming when you stand
 alone in the dark of a dark dark closet every
 night and when youre alone almost all the
 time of the day or night dreaming becomes
 an art a necessary art it becomes the shield
 against dying inside losing the soul being
 the robot you were originally designed to
 be

    it was there hidden in her closet she
  stood alone with it at night in the dark
  closet and with the dream-a piece of
  paper an order blank-she was not so much
  alone 

    kelsey stood under the perfumed deodor-
  ant spray for three minutes he ran out to
  the sink and sprayed his mouth with
  noffend and then he held his mouth open
  while alice brushed his teeth carefully with
  ivorv-glo he zipped into his lounge suit
  of coral pink and ran to the mirror

    well  he asked

    very saleable kelsey the mirror said

    kelsey sat down in the living room to
 wait for his favorite love

    alice watched kelseys love who didnt
  seem to see alice at all when she came in
  but then domestics had no meaning to any-
  one but their masters gloria-golden
  flesh  warm and human love of kelsey love

in a transparent gown tight and clinging to
the flesh warm and waiting love love
kissing and kissing-but alice tried not to
look at love

  some time ago she had liked looking at
love but now she felt fear fear of love-kiss-
ing she felt an intense hunger that had
elements of terror blended with elements of
awakening as she looked at it trying not to
look or feel any connection with it

   but she felt the desire growing from eve-
ning to evening as she remembered or
looked at kelsey and his love-loving and
hugging and kissing-the desire to hold
him to feel him her own so as never to
let him leave never let him escape never
let herself be taken from him and rebuilt
and lost and that was the cause of the de-
sire making it agonizingly stronger and
the sight of it-the sight and sound of the
loving the kisses the motions of loving-
were more and more unbearable

   gloria was beautiful so beautiful she was
slim and warm and tall and curved and hu-
man

  but alice had to look just the same as
though there was some last justification in
looking because it could never happen to
alice because they were human and she
was not

  they were sitting tightly entwined about
one another on the couch

  we ought to get a roommate permit real
fast kelsey said in a whisper

  but it hasnt been two weeks yet since
the office party gloria said

  that was where they had met and knew it
was love at the office party

  but maybe if we asked- kelsey said

  but we shouldnt rush it honey it
wouldnt be sincere

  yes thats true kelsey said what
would people think 

  and then as alice watched they seemed
to draw slowly apart as though the face
the color the sound and voices from the
tevee was throwing an invisible wall be-
tween them they were staring at the tevee
longer and longer and finally they werent
looking at one another at all

  there were always a number of people
present inside the tevee frame if one per-
son was talking the background was full of
people-people moving dancing walking
but there just the same always

  the woman was smiling intensely out of
awakening	

the screen dont be left out she said be
a solid member of your group you can own
a sky-splitter jet sporter now without of-
fending your crowd our special consumers
research proves that now at last these amaz-
ing sky-splitters are no longer conspicuous
items but are fully accepted as normal by
over ninety-three per cent of the consumer
public you can enjoy the cloud thrills of a
sky-splitter without being considered in
any way eccentric press your interest or
order button now an immediate demon-
stration will be arranged 

  dancers swirled a sky-splitter jet dis-
solved from clouds it was as if a dream
had become abruptly real surrounded by
people laughing and accepting one another
the sleek projectile gave the warmest im-
pression of itself being organic and one of
the happy happy crowd

  kelsey jerked forward and jabbed the i-
am-interested button

  i dont care gloria pouted id still
feel kind of-well-like i was showing off
if i had a sky-splitter

 but now everybody will have one kel-
sey said

  alice wondered when they were really
going to make love like the lovers were
always never quite doing on tevee but
alice decided she would never look at that
it would hurt too much

another self-improvement commer-
cial this time a man with a ballet in
the background

  are you in tune with your crowd if
you do not feel that your tastes are in per-
fect accord with the tastes of your group
send for the reacto tester this mechanical
device when attached to the brain records
accurate tastes it insures comforting con-
formity and protects you against the anxie-
ties of conspicuousness remember you
cant stray from the norm with a reacto

  kelsey and his love had moved apart now
they were staring at the tevee everything
the tevee had to say seemed to involve get-
ting along with people being loved being
liked being accepted not being rejected not
offending how to love efficiently how to be
loved gracefully-

  but there they are the two of them alice
thought what are they waiting for 

  waiting to look just right to smile just
right it was a matter of appearance no one

knew that better than alice did who looked
all wrong and could never look any differ-
ent never look human never look full
of love

  you smiled when you loved you smiled
and your flesh turned warm if you had
flesh if your warmth was not a dial to be
turned up or down if on the outside you
were human so that everyone could know
oh alice kelsey called out

  alice came in from the kitchen yes
master kelsey

  gloria stared on and on into the tevee
while its color flickered over her half sleep-
ing face

  tomorrows your rest day alice
  yes master kelsey

  well you can go stand in your closet
now that will give you all night and all
day tomorrow to rest is everything taken
care of around the place for tuesday 
yes master kelsey

  kelsey smiled at alice he whispered
low she likes me a little more dont you
think so alice

  yes

  he smiled more widely well alice
good night relax your thermostat
kelsey laughed as she bowed slightly and
walked out onto the porch and opened the
door of her closet and got inside and stood
there the four walls almost touching her
when the door closed and she stood alone
in the loneliness of her darkness and si-
lence

  for a long time it had been a rich dark-
ness filled with an ever growing understand-
ing of herself in a world alone in a darkness
ail her own where there could never be
others of her kind and lonely darkness was
her only friend

  but it was different now love made the
loneliness unbearable love turned lonely
darkness to stabbing pain now it seemed
like death no death was nothing this was
worse than death this was not being un-
being a being that was not a being but
something never able to break from its shell
staying shut up forever in its mechanical
confines

  they did not give me life she thought
they sat me down before the worlds stage
to watch without being able to understand
now i understand but i cannot live

  she clenched her hands and trembled in
the dark and felt the quickening beat of the


startling stories

things that made her run

  in the dark the suffocating dark now that
she knew what it could mean to really be
alive and not one of the walking dead in
the dark alone dreaming of kelsey dream-
ing of human heart touching human heart
of the lips of his kiss of his arms around her
neck longing for the face of kelsey next to
her own in darkness lit by love to take his
mouth to cover his body with kisses to
clasp his neck in her hands-

  and there alone where she had dreamed
a thousand dreams she knew she could no
longer merely dream dreams were not
enough

  not enough not enough

  a silent scream shrieked inside the nar-
row closet and cut the dark to tatters and
she ran out out into the back yard of kel-
seys house and stood under the open sky

  she had the order blank the paper in
her hand a tiling stolen the result of an
act no robot could be guilty of because no
robot had a soul

  but i have a soul there is a point at
which the soul is sick at this point one
awakens-awakens or dies

clutching the paper she had stolen
from her love she ran toward the com-
mutor jet station nowhere was there a
light not even from the city ten miles from
the housing project in which kelsey lived
but alice had no thought whatever of an
air-raid there were worse darknesses than
a blackout there were worse ways to die
than under a rain of white fire bombs

  the fear of the bombs was the fear of nev-
er having lived not a fear of dying

  the fear was over there was only hope
the commitment was made nothing could
be worse than the way it had been and
failure could be only a final admission of a
defeat that had been there all the time

  she got off the commutor jet at the up-
town station and walked through darkness
she walked alone in the city no human
being would have been walking in the dark-
ness they were hovering together behind
blacked-out windows in groups but she felt
nothing as she walked in the blackness

  she knew where the clinic was the ad-
dress was on the order blank

  she hurried faster and faster at no mo-
ment in her life had she felt dawning in her
such a hope of happiness such a feeling of

ecstasy at no time even in her deepest
dreams had she dreamed that she might
really be loved by master kelsey

   it was such a daring scheme that she even
hesitated to think about it afraid it might
be merely a projection of a dream

  in black print at the top of the order
blank were the words

fix me please

make me beautiful

make me pleasant to the
customers and a lovely
robot to remember

  alice was a domestic she was not sup-
posed to carry that order to the clinic and
be fixed up the order blank was strictly
for specialized receptionist robots office
workers robots that had to have a different
sort of front to meet the consumer public
originally all robots had been made to look
alike but now for psychological reasons it
had been decided to change the outward
appearance of receptionists and other ro-
bots that met the general public

  they had to be lovely to look at and be
able to smile in the most pleasant way pos-
sible

  laboring robots domestics their form
was more functional than beautiful it lacked
the surface polish of the office-working ro-
bots and yet alice knew that one of the
beautiful receptionist robots for example was
indeed beautiful and that it was almost im-
possible to distinguish them from beautiful
human beings

  it was daring and risky enough to be go-
ing to the clinic to pretend she was a recep-
tionist from kelseys office there to be beau-
tified it was a lot more risky and daring to
have the idea that she might be beautiful
enough to pass herself off at least for a lit-
tle while as a human being

  but she had one big advantage they
would never suspect her they had no idea
she was sure of that that any robot could
act of her own free will and steal an order
blank and pretend to be something she was
not in order to be made beautiful

  a receptionist robot looked just like a
beautiful human woman she only acted like
a robot but if i looked like that so beauti-
ful i could feel human too i could be
human

kelsey could give back my love to me and
awakening	

our hearts would kiss and loneliness would
die

  this was monday tomorrow was her
rest day she wouldnt be missed as alice
the domestic until wednesday morning

  she didnt want to think about what
might happen after that there would have
to be something happen when alice the
domestic was rqxirted missing but then
she was running way ahead of herself it
was still only a hope that her scheme would
work the way she had to dream that it
would

  she went in out of the dark into the
clinic building the receptionist behind the
shiny chrome desk in the outer office hardly
looked at alice at all alice looked at her
though it was impossible to tell whether the
receptionist was human or not but she
was beautiful as beautiful as gloria ton-
nencourt

  a sign on the wall behind the receptionist
said

 beauty is as beauty does

  the order blank was stamped with a
number and alice was told to wait

  sitting there waiting she felt as though
something steel-edged had smashed into her
chest she felt cold and adjusted her ther-
mostat slightly the steely sensation in-
creased her hands were clenched she felt
something inside of her pounding and
pounding

  i can tell you all my thoughts at last
now master kelsey darling darling kelsey
i can tell you all the hojes without achieve-
ment all about the endless dark hours
alone-

  her numler was called and she went in
through a door that seemed to lead into an
endlessly narrowing white funnel lined with
shiny doors

rphe room of hoje was a square white
box filled with shiny chrome cabinets
in the center was a table on little silent
rubber wheels with a lamp looking down
upon it like a gigantic unblinking eye

  a slight willowy man gushed at her and
gripped her arms with exuberance and cov-
ered her over with the moist film of his
bright and eager eyes

  his voice was high and shrill so you
want to be beautiful lovely to look at
yes

  you shall he my dear lie down please

lie down and trust me you will have to
trust me of course simply have to trust me
just the same

  will i be really beautiful-like the re-
ceptionist in the outer office

  ha ha my dear he was pushing and
pulling and finally she was lying down and
staring at the whirling lines of the white
ceiling and seeing kelseys smiling waiting
yearning face in it that is a joke a very
funny joke the receptionist out there is a
human being at least she would lead the
unsuspecting to believe that she is how-
ever i must confess my dear that i have
learned the sad truth that she is human
in name only that her heart is ice and she
is bitter with ambition

  but she is so beautiful

  ah but beauty is as beauty does my
dear or as beauty thinks and sweet little
ambitious della in the outer office does not
think lovely thoughts not at all believe me
i have learned that from sad experience
his hands hovered over her eagerly fluid-
ly as though there were no bones in them
i want to be as beautiful as possible
you are fortunate in having been sent
to julian i promise that under my touch
you shall blossom into radiant beauty the
essence of feminine loveliness you will be
simply devastating

  he placed the tips of his long white fin-
gers together and studied her with his head
angled like a birds a brunette i think-
id rather be a blonde

  oh you would would you my dear
you seem extraordinarily concerned for a
robot he stepped back and studied her
curiously and the black eyes sharpened like
narrowing beams of black searching light

  you know he said softly i studied
in the greatest salons of the continent to
beautify women now i specialize in beauti-
fying robots why simple but paradoxical
but not as paradoxical as it might seem i
can make a robot lovelier than a human
lovelier than a human being
exactly much lovelier beauty comes
from within as the sages say it comes from
the heart and the soul my dear and so
few humans any longer have either heart
or soul of course that would imply that
robots do have hearts and souls so please
my dear do not repeat what i have said
already i am thought to be excessively ec-
centric for this sad conformistic age of orth-


startling stories

odoxy and stupid unimaginative depend-
ency beauty comes from individuality and
strength my dear it comes from sadness
and the ability to admit a sense of tragedy
ah-but it is sad for me for julian my
dear that my fulfillment comes only from
adding a sense of life to humanoids and
looking at you-the likes of you-sometimes
i wonder if you-

  his voice trailed off like smoke and he
shrugged and waved his hands in the air
so you want to be a blonde why a
blonde 

  a tall blonde she said with lots and
lots of sex appeal

  he kissed the tips of his fingers and
rolled his eyes your wish shall lie granted
i julian will outdo myself he leaned over
her his voice was low why is it that a
robot can be made more beautiful than a
human tell me my dear tell me and i
sliall never tell anyone else do you have a
soul do you have a heart do you know
what it is to be sad and alone and can you
find some pleasure in it do you perhaps
even find pleasure in yourself and some-
times find it unnecessary to swim in a sea
ot humanity like a brainless protozoon
but will i feel real the way a human
feels 

  he straightened up slowly he touched
his forehead where beads of sweat were
forming and slowly he licked his thin red
lips

  my my but you are an inquisitive
robot why does it mean so much
tell me will i feel like the real thing
flesh-when you touch flesh-

  his hands moved over her he bent above
her a cabinet slid open she caught the
glint of many different colors of eyeballs
looking startlingly real and liquidly alive
and rows of variously sized breasts and
lips and muscle paddings and eyelashes and
eyebrows and ears and noses and fingers
there were gleaming instruments and jars
and plastic tapes

  his face was close above hers and his
lips worked nervously he whispered i
can see how it will be my dear you will
feel so real to the touch of a hungry love
that i shall be broken-hearted to let you
go from my pygmalion palace of dreams
come true my dear believe me believe
julian when he tells you this-there is no
lonelier being in the world than a man who

has not forgotten what beauty is in a world
that has turned ugly from having lost its
soul

  then she knew that julian had turned off
her thermostat suddenly there was no feel-
ing no sound no sight except that of the
general blackout rushing in out of the night
down the halls into the rooms into her
eyes

  how quickly and painlessly a robot could
die she thought how easy it was to live
and die and come back to life you could be
bom suddenly full-grown and efficient you
could be blotted out again just as suddenly
you could be born in any shape or size born
to do any one or combination of so many
different things and when your job was
done you could so quickly be put to rest
again you could be born ugly or round or
square or like a pyramid or something al-
most all arms or legs or eyes or ears

  you could be born beautiful hardly dis-
tinguishable from a beautiful human being
who could receive love

  you could be born ugly and then le killed
and brought back again as beautiful as a
human being

  but you could not live without love
could something be returned that  orte
knew was there 

she stood before the mirror hardly
daring to breathe

  oh god julian whispered he stood in
a corner of the room and his eyes were nar-
rowed and his hands were gripped together
i knew i was a genius but this-this is
something else what have i done statues
turned to living beauty what in the name
of god is this 

  im beautiful she said

  yes yes he said thickly yes-

  as beautiful as gloria

  whoever she is yes yes-

  he will love me

  i love you my dear i love you he
whispered again and again

  a great calm came over her a great calm
and a great chill she felt uneasy because
she felt so wonderful too wonderful too un-
easy as if she might feel too deeply and
something inside would break 

  she felt julians hand  her and he was
turning her around i must kiss you he
said i must kiss you i love you

  yes she smiled you may kiss me
awakening



  she imagined it was kelsey kissing her
kelseys arms were around her neck and
she was longing for the face of kelsey she
moved her lips over his forehead and his
cheeks until she felt the moistness of his
mouth she saw the unsettled look in jul-
ians face and the sweat on his upper lip it
was her first kiss and it was kelsey she
kissed

  julian stepped back and touched his lips
he shook his head and jerked his face
nervously toward the door

  he stared into her eyes his fingers ran
over her face now  see it he whispered
hoarsely now  see it it was there before
liefore i ever touched you it was in your
eyes ive always known that ive known
that no one creates beauty out of pastes
and tape and foam rubber and false hair
i must go now she said i must
hurry

  thats right thats very right youve
got to go out of here out of my sight and
out of my mind

  do i feel real

  my god theres this light-that is
what you feel-the light listen listen to
me whoever whatever you are listen
whats happening youre more real than
the woman who invites me to her apartment
and assures me with insipid smiles and
phony gestures that she is real whats
real youre real-but you cant be real
he turned away from her and leaned
against the wall there was a catch in his
voice and she could see the throbbing in
the side of his neck you had better go now
and tomorrow i wont remember you im
probably going crazy beginning to believe
in my own pitifulwishes everyone i know
-all of them-shells of phony beauty
something painted on something stuck on
the outside nothing real nothing real at
all and what do i do-dream dream of
somehow bringing real beauty back but it
never comes back beauty comes from in-
side i cannot paste it onto the outside of
a hollow shell and make beauty come alive
julian-

  he blinked at her as though startled and
afraid what has happened with you  how
many like you are there no i cant start
believing such an incredible thing id be
lost get out get out

  she touched his shoulder goodbye she
said softly i know what loneliness is

  when he turned to her again there were
tears in his eyes he whispered i believe
you do-you really do but how could it be
how could you have inside of you what we
humans are losing

  she sat in the commutor jet returning
to master kelsey she knew that looking
like a beautiful woman was not quite
enough she had to know the right things
to say she felt that she did know all the
correct retorts quips the polite gestures
and nuances and intonations that made one
innocuously acceptable she had watched
the teevee for years as they explained how
to win people and influence the right friends
and gain the maximum amount of response
from the group from love from whoever
was joining their smile with yours

  she had learned all the controversial
things that must never be talked about and
all the popular immediate things that should
be talked about incessantly but she felt an
intense need for rehearsal this had to be
successful she had committed herself she
could not fail failure meant a return to the
factory and the final fatal twist of the ther-
mostat it would not be murder for they
were ignorant of the existence of a robots
soul and she didnt care about the risk she
would feel her love for kelsey returned  she
would feel his arms his lips his love let
them whoever they were worry about the
disappearance of a drab domestic named
alice

  alice was dead alice had been reborn
alice had come out of the lonely dark of un-
born waste into the living light of love

  she carried on this imagined conversa-
tion with kelsey rehearsing no it was not
enough to be filled to overflowing with love
you had to know how to act you had to
smile all the time you had to say the right
things and know when not to speak beauty
is as beauty does

  well the imaginary kelsey said smil-
ing do you like arnsos new hit recording
ill always want you as much
as the one he recorded last week 

  its wonderful she said smiling the
sweetest thing since well always be
together no matter what
which reminds me honey im going to
buy one of those new snap-grav-share-
the-fall suits dont you think they would
be fun 

  lots of fun the imaginary kelsey said
mfl	startling stories

smiling six people instead of three can
share it the more the merrier

in her mind the imaginary kelsey
hesitated then said what quik-pik
book are you reading right now 

  which one are you reading honey
she evaded

  you never read anything everyone else
wasnt reading she knew that much

  -well i lilve my day at the of-
fice it shows how a woman gets through
a day with her fellow workers in her office
how she smiles and is pleasant and well-
liked and never loses her temper it shows
all the little tricks you can pull that help
you sell yourself

  that sounds like a wonderful book
honey ill get it at once

  it sounded right but there was some-
thing wrong it was the right thing to talk
about but it wasnt what she would prefer
to talk about if she were alone with kelsey
feeling the way she felt she didnt think
she would want to talk much at all if she
were alone with kelsey

  but she knew that was a real social ta-
boo-not saying anything at all

  anyway she gave herself a gold star for
being so sociable with the imaginary kelsey
she was sure very sure she could sell her-
self to kelsey

  only she would have to have another
name two names human names some-
thing that sounded beautiful

  anita anita starre

  she would knock  master kelseys
door and ask him for someones address
he was so nice and considerate he would
surely ask her in for a drink or just ask
her in while he gave her directions

  dry leaves crackled under her as she
walked the half-block toward kelseys
house the night was black with a few cold
stars in the endless vault of sky it was late
but in almost all the houses you could see
the gentle glow of tevee color through the
windows

  there was  sound at all where the
houses of the project all looking exactly
the same dwindled away into darkness like
lines of dots made by a typewriter

  it was she thought as though everyone
and everything in the world were waiting
waiting for the great white hot scream to
explode in the night the great awakening

the blinding hot flash of awakening that
comes before the end but alice didnt feel
afraid at all of an air-raid as she walked up
onto master kelseys porch and rang the
bell there had been so main- false alarms
she wondered sometimes if there was any
real threat at all the war-a vague thing
far away never here always somewhere
else but always supposed to be getting
nearer the war with the asians-it just
went on and on you heard about it and saw
it on tevee if you werent afraid to look
at the newscasts but it never seemed to
happen here

  his footsteps behind the door the door
opening his shadow there the pink lounge
suit the wavy hair with streaks of brown
in the viking yellow the face sleepy from
teevee coming awake as he saw the beau-
tiful woman standing there smiling he
smiled their smiles met

  hello she said im anita starre im
looking for - carnegie way
youre lost

   i seem to be lost yes

  the great hope dawned in her as he
smiled at her in a way no robot had ever
been smiled at a tender calm moved over
her the machinery that made her go the
sparks that made her live all seemed to
jump and tremble under the beautiful shell
that had been created by the hands of julian

  the great joy lulled her surged inside her
she could be near so near him now that
she had the right look and the right smile
she could tell him and show him how she
loved to be near him-no she would not
have to tell him that he would know real
love you just knew alxjut you didnt have
to say it she would just kiss him and kiss
him and never have to tell him-

  this is carnegie way kelsey was
saying his eyes were fixed on her face
then his eyes were brightening as they
looked at her height and her slim rich
curves but its five blocks from the ad-
dress youre looking for he pointed to
the left and told her how to get to -
his eyes continued to explore her figure
with just the right degree of polite interest

  she stepped closer until she was almost
inside the hallway she could feel the
warmth of him why she said suddenly
youre mr kelsey

  his smile broadened with some hungry
concept of himself that had been fed but
awakening	

how did you know miss starre

  a girl friend of mine miss davies
works in your office

  oh miss davies she got a silver
star-

  yes she admires you so much she has
a picture of you mr kelsey she told me
how you won a golden star for being so
cooperative

  we all help one another miss davies
is such a wonderfully warm and sympathetic
girl well miss starre what a coinci-
dence

  isnt it

  well-maybe you could come in and rest
a few minutes were watching tevee

  she nodded quickly she felt that mag-
netic force the clicking communion the way
she had always seen it on tevee how easy
it was after all if you looked right and
smiled right and said the correct things
oh id love to

miss gloria tonnencourt
stood up and the three of them seemed
subdued and softened in the tevee light
kelsey said gloria this is a friend of
mine a really dear friend anita starre
there was something wrong it was un-
der the surface alice thought but it was
there under the smiles something tense
and wrong and dangerous she had never
felt it before but she felt it now it was
gloria the way the smile seemed set on
glorias face as she said she was very
pleased to meet miss starre it had always
been there that smile so it couldnt go away
but alice knew that if she were miss ton-
nencourt she would not feel like smiling no
one could smile she thought if they were
losing their love real love you could die of
losing

  they all smiled at one another kelsey
got three drinks and they drank to one
anothers happiness as though there was no
question that there could be anything else
in the world but happiness

  gloria has to do whats right alice
thought no matter how painful she has
to do whats right im lucky because she
has to do whats right because she always
has to be a good sport about everything

  they chatted together like good sports
for a while talked about the pop tune of the
week the favorite sports hero of the day
the best quik-pik book of the hour the

sky-splitter the roaromatic roadeater the
silver and golden stars for cooperation
the blue stars for communal feeling the
carnegie awards for sociability

  they have to get along alice thought
gladly they have to get along they cant
afford to offend one another

  gloria finally got up seeming tired in
spite of her smile and said id better be
going now i-i can see thatyou two have
a real thing for one another already i-i
think its just-wonderful-so wonderful
really-

  kelsey didnt seem to hear gloria at all
hardly seemed to know she was there he
kept looking at alice please dont go
gloria he said as he kept on looking at
alice

  its awfully sweet of you to ask me to
stay but i really must go now its-its
getting late

  i know how you really feel alice
thought i know i know somewhere deep
inside you feel an awful sickness like death
but on the outside you smile i know how
you feel

  but do you know how you feel anymore
gloria can you feel the way you really
feel what would happen if-

  but no matter how gloria felt no mir-
ror on a wall could have been critical of
her appearance her poise her polite good-
sport way of bowing out

  gloria moved toward the door kelsey
hurried over there and opened it for her
you two be happy gloria whispered
you two seem to be so- so very right
for an anther

  the door shut it was as though gloria
tonnencourt had never been there

  how could it be so easy alices hand
trembled as kelsey moved toward her
with gloria it had been so quick happen-
ing so fast over so easily

  regular girl kelsey was saying
what wonderful warmth and under-
standing

  shes sweet alice heard herself say-
ing but that wasnt true she only felt
that gloria had been sad if it had been
sweet it was bitter-sweet sadness but alice
had to forget about gloria gloria was
gone it was like she had never been here
at all as though all those evenings of love
had never been switch it on switch it off
	startling stories

it was like tevee she thought like te-
vee-

  kelsey asked her to sit down on the
couch and then he was sitting near her
nearer to her then he was touching her
his face inches from hers

  it seems ive known you for years and
years he said

  and then she was forgetting everything
else but kelsey it was easy so easy when
you looked and felt right so easy and
she didnt want to think about anything
else but kelsey dear sweet darling kel-
sey

  she received him in her arms with a
wild desire a wild hunger to cover his
face with kisses she felt the intensity
taking hold of her gripping her body
quickening the pounding throb of ma-
chinery that was hidden now hidden away
deep and silent and beating now like a
human heart

  she kissed his cheek her lips strayed
over his skin her lips glided over his
face felt the moist trembling of his lips

  she felt his trembling his shuddering
sigh the way his arms convulsed and
gripped her and then she saw the un-
settled look the light in his eyes as he
clung to her and at the same time seemed
to push her away

  he was frightened he was trembling
and he was afraid and his face was flushed

  whats the matter darling she whis-
pered

he stared at her his lips were
trembling i-i dont know what
is it it was never like this

  what was never like this

  love-i mean-you-what is it
real its real darling kelsey thats
the difference isnt it

  real his face had an uncompre-
hending look the cheek muscles trembling
as he spoke his voice hollow and fright-
ened something he whispered what
is it  ive never felt anything like it it-
its too much maybe too much or some-
thing-i dont know-

  his face was white he was sliding
away from her

  already i am losing him she thought t
hes going away somehow he senses what
is wrong without knowing what it is he

knows in spite of the beautiful surface
he senses that i am not real not human
not a being at all

  no please she whispered

  she moved desperately and clutched at
him and held him tightly shocked at his
stiffness now his reluctance his trembling
she felt tears inside though they could
never show please please she whis-
pered

  his voice was shaking listen-its too
much you scare me wait a minute now
lets talk about this i want to know-
how can you be scared of love
love this isnt love its-its like
anger its-ive never known anything
like this

  let yourself know please

  he closed his eyes his lips trembled
i-i felt like i was going to die he
whispered

  suddenly he turned and stared at the
tevee

  he knows she thought dully he knows
im what i am underneath but he doesnt
know that he knows he cant admit what
seems impossible

  he gasped his body jerked she look-
ed at the tevee frame there was noth-
ing on it suddenly but a frightening waver-
ing milky emptiness

  and a voice a voice without a face
due to the possibility of an immediate
air-raid tevee is dead all transportation
is stopped those of you who were
thoughtful and cooperative enough with
your sponsor to order our emergency en-
tertainment projectors will now turn them
on it will greatly decrease anxiety red-
out regulations will be in effect for two
hours	

  kelseys face was gray air-raid he
whispered its here its really here
its all right darling she touched
his arm its all right-

  the light went out

  somewhere alice heard screaming it
seemed to fill the walls the floor the ceil-
ing and the night itself everywhere as
though the very air was screaming in some
vast agony the sirens

  she heard a whimpering sound and real-
ized that it was kelsey she held him
tightly in her arms he was shivering

  the tevee screen seemed like a page on
which vital print had died something
awakening	

 strangely alive but without sound or mean-
 ing like an exposed brain without thought
 like the deadness of an open eye in a corpse

    all lights will be extinguished for two
 hours the voice said everyone will go
 immediately to their air-raid shelters

   two hours kelsey whispered

   im here she said were together
 darling theres nothing-

   he didnt seem to hear her he leaped
 out of her arms and she heard furniture
 crashing as he blundered around wildly in
 the dark

    the shelter he yelled hoarsely the
 shelter

    she followed him unerringly in the dark
 to the stairs without stumbling when
 she found him at the bottom of the stairs
 in the tunnel leading to the private air-
 raid shelter he was whimpering and shiv-
 ering violently

   two hours-two hours-two hours-
 he whispered over and over

    she could tell by the way he said it that
 it meant something else to him not two
 hours but something infinitely longer un-
 endurably longer some kind of awful
 forever

   she helped him into the shelter and
 closed the thick door she couldnt under-
 stand that kind of loneliness she had
 stood in the black lonely closet for years
 she had worked alone she could under-
 stand the loneliness of being without love
 but this fear of his-it had no meaning
 for her

   and as she looked at kelsey cowering
 in the corner of the shelter she realized
 something else-kelsey himself had very
 little meaning he was not what he had
 seemed he was empty he was hollow
 he wasnt quite real that was what his
 fear was a fear of discovering he had
 nothing inside a horror of the absence of
 something you could create inside yourself
 only by being alone

   alice knew that now maybe she had
 always known it but now she admitted it
 to herself

   the shelter was a small square room
 lined with concrete and lead and steel
 there was a large supply of food and a
  method of reprocessing the air a person
 could live in it for a long time alice knew
 she could she would have loved being
 there just with kelsey but kelsey was

empty and there was no way he could give
her back her love nothing in him he could
use to share loneliness with her

  two hours-

  but i love you she said weakly we
have one another we can talk we can
tell one another all about-

  no tevee kelsey whispered we
cant get out no one can get in two
hours

  the screaming was in the shelter walls
it quivered in the floor and ceiling and
walls but there was really no sound
nothing could penetrate here no sound
or light kelsey looked around the small
enclosure it may be longer-

  its only a warning alice said there
may not be a real air-raid at all

  talk he suddenly screamed at her
lets talk talk to me-

  but the superficial things slipped away
and she couldnt remember any of them
she wanted to take him in her arms but
she couldnt do that now because it wasnt
real she couldnt talk about all those
meaningless things maybe now nothing
would be enough to satisfy kelseys hollow
fear

ith gloria with all of them alice
knew that kelsey had always been
alone more alone more horribly alone
than she had ever been for kelsey had
nothing inside of him to keep him company
or to sincerely share with another

  he had no love in him

  she tried to comfort him but he was on
his knees shivering and whimpering then
he tried to beat his way out through the
door she pulled him back and he fell
sobbing on the floor squirming and rub-
bing his hands and his face into the floor
as though to get some feeling of life from it

  the trembling of the walls and floor
continued very gently as though even that
was somehow being polite as though even
that was trying to make things not so dis-
comforting

  kelsey was whining and sobbing ive
got to get out-get out theres a shelter
-a communal shelter the project place
-people-lots of people-

  all right she said lets take a
chance if you want to well go to that
other shelter-with people in it

  but when they got to the top of the stairs


startling stories

and stepped into the living room the lights
went on the tevee came to color-sound-
lite again

  the air-raid warning was over

  a smiling face materialized out of the
waver lines

  the threat of the air-raid is over due
to our wonderful cooperative spirit the
enemys cowardly attack accomplished lit-
tle except the minor destruction of a few
scattered points were sure now that
anyone who has not ordered our cozy-
corner air-raid shelter will do so with-
out further delay it comes equipped re-
member with three-dimensional tevee
there is the illusion of real people-

  over fifty million air-raid shelters were
sold within an hour

  but alice wasnt concerned about that
she gave kelsey a sedative and put him
to bed and then she went to her dark
closet and stood in it until wednesday
morning she had time to think about
things and a wonderful calm came over
her and she knew she didnt care what
happened to her now she was strong
enough to live alone and take whatever
was coming to her without fear

  when she shook kelsey awake wednes-
day morning and told him she was alice
he laughed shocked and incredulous try-
ing to appear amused but she told him
about the order blank and convinced him
she really was alice and anita starre did
not exist

  he ran and called a robot repair clinic
he was almost incoherent trying to tell
the clinic what had happened but they
finally understood and said they would be
right out to take the domestic away

  he seethed frightened as he looked at
her

  i dont understand he said several
times no one told you to do such a

thing how could a robot just up and do
such a thing

  she started to answer but didnt there
was nothing to say

  robots can become inefficient kelsey
said they can wear down a little and
have to be repaired but how could a robot
just up and do a thing like this

  because of loneliness and the need for
love she sniiled she could smile now
it would have been funny for her to have
said such a thing as that

  she didnt care she heard the jet-truck
drop down by the curb outside kelseys
house she heard the footsteps coming up
the walk onto the porch but she didnt
care she was strong enough not to care
at all

  she cared not at all for any of them
master kelsey included she cared a little
for julian for he had understood a little
but she didnt care about any of the others
now they hardly existed they had
nothing in them everything had been
frozen forever and nothing really moved
inside

  they were empty they were nothing
they didnt exist

  you saw the bright surfaces and the
smiles as they walked and talked on the
street and for a while you wanted to be-
lieve they existed that they were there
but they werent really there at all

  she smiled and stood still and waited
for them to move toward her they seemed
afraid of her

   there s nothing to be afraid of not here
not in me she wanted to say its in you
that the fear is for what is more frighten-
ing than emptiness and the feel of hollow
time going by 

  at least she had the joy of knowing she
had been alive

   the hand turned off her therrfiostat

 it took a trip in
 time to make
 a man of mikel   

time out for redheads

  itr miriam allex dcford

his name was mikel skot he was
thirty-four five-feet-ten and lean
with decent features and all his hair and
quite nice brown eyes but somehow he
always seemed to give the impression of
being of indeterminate age and slightly
dusty he lived alone he gravitated be-
tween his job and his lodgings and since
the age of fourteen he had never known a
girl well enough to call her by her first
name

  for twelve years ever since  he had
sold tickets at one of the windows of time
travel tours unlimited if raises hadnt



been automatic he would never have had
one though he was punctual faithful hon-
est quick and accurate even the other
ticket-sellers still called him citizen skot

  he had never budged from his cozy
era-even though as an employee he was
entitled to take any tour he wished on his
semi-annual vacation at no cost to him be-
yond the planetary sales tax-nor had he
ever left his native city let alone his native
planet he was too shy even to realize he
was lonely

  this morning there was the usual rush
staggered vacations meant that any time of


startling stories

the year was the busy season for ttt
skillfully mikel skot arranged tours and
calculated rates

  two weeks in rome  bc that
will be creds  citizen you get your
costume and equipment in room  right
off the teleport yes im sure theyll have
a latin language-transformer you can
hire england in  one month re-
servation in the name of chas rusl yes
i have it right here that will be creds
 please you mean you want a ticket
for here in los for a week six years ago in
february why yes its a little unusual
but-oh certainly i understand-a second
honeymoon congrats citizen-not many
couples stay together that long just a
min while i look up the rate for two

  the queue seemed endless and crowds
of travelers who already had their tickets
were pushing their way through the doors
back of the ticket-office to the teleport it-
self together with the friends who were
seeing them off if mikel had had a mo-
ment to spare which he hadnt he might
have wondered as so often before at the
numbers of people everybody except him-
self seemed to know

  the morning wore on and he was be-
ginning to think longingly of  oclock
when his lunchtime relief would arrive and
he could sit in a quiet corner of an autocaf
and watch the tridimens screen for the
days news while he ate his favorite vitatabs
and smoked a healthcig

  then everything happened all at once

  the girl standing at his ticket-window
was a redhead her eyes were green with
little dancing amber lights in them and
she smiled at him as if he were the kind of
man girls do smile at and not ineffectual
mikel skot

  can you tell me she began in a warm
slightly husky voice

  then she screamed loudly and collapsed

there were shouts and jostling and
milling around and somebody leaned
over the counter and abruptly thrust some-
thing into his hand he stood there dazed
grabbing the object whatever it was then
he leaned over the counter the girl was
lying there very still on one side of her a
pool of blood was slowly forming on the
floor

  the guards were coming from all direc-
tions trying to get some kind of quiet and
order into the excited throng mikel looked
down at the thing in his hand

  it was a knife a steel knife with a
wooden handle it was obviously an anti-
que and of great value and it was smeared
with fresh blood

  mikel skot lost his head entirely never
before had he or anyone he had ever heard
of been involved even remotely in any
kind of violence he never even took in
historical crime plays the redheaded girl
was dead and he held in his hand the knife
that had killed her and she had been the
first girl who had smiled at him for years

  he wanted out-now

  he reached behind him and grabbed a
ticket at random not even looking to see
what date it was he punched it hastily
for a week nobody was looking at him
everybody was still yelling at everybody
else and the sweating guards were trying
to line people up and blocking the doors so
that they could not get away mikel ran
to the corridor back of the counters which
the ticket-sellers used and saw that the
company door to the teleport was open
out there what with parties singing
happy timetrav to you or noisily
greeting homecomers and the loudspeaker
directing passengers to their proper sta-
tions and the roar of the take-offs and
returnjets nobody seemed to have noticed
that anything was wrong in the ticket-
office

  mikel glanced around once to be sure
that nobody was watching him and
slipped through the door he was still
holding the knife automatically he thrust
it into his belt-pouch

  it was typical of him that after twelve
years not one of the teleport attendants
knew him by sight he thrust his ticket at
the nearest one the man glanced at it
three other travelers were trying to get
his attendon at the same time and said
platform eight mikel hurried there

  before he reached it he remembered
something he had punched the ticket for
duration but not for place well that was
all right if it had no place-punch it would
mean los itself he was escaping into his
own city

  the attendant at eight took his ticket
time out for redheads	

then peered at him dubiously

  you havent clothes for the period
citizen go to room  and-

  it doesnt matter mikel interrupted
him he was in a fever to be gone im-
its a research project he added in a sud-
den inspiration which didht make sense
even to himself but which the attendant
used to strange statements from travelers
accepted without comment he sealed the
timeporter on to mikels wrist set it for
return in a week and helped him into the
telechamber

  there was a swift moment when his
head felt empty and his stomach heaved
and mikel skot found himself sitting on an
iron bench in a park

  he had a week now to think things over
he was inlos-he had to be his ticket
said so

  but when 

  he looked about him it must be the
middle of the day the same time it had
been before and the park was full of people
on their lunch-hour they were dressed
weirdly-the men and half the women wore
tight cylindrical garments one on each leg
the upper part of their bodies were cov-
ered with various kinds of brightly-colored
cloth though occasionally he saw a woman
who wore only a breast-holder alove her
bare midriff mikel in his belted tunic
huddled in a corner of his bench fearful of
notice but nobody paid any attention to
him and once a man passed who had on a
tunic too-a long white one over bare feet
and under long hair and a flowing beard
apparently in this period people dressed as
they pleased-at least in los

  the citv itself what part of it he could
see from his vantage-point was stranger
than the people there were no moving
sidewalks and no weather-canopies over
the streets-though perhaps these had only
been removed for the dry season the
buildings looked shrunken and tiny-hard-
ly one seemed to be more than thirty or
forty stories high archaic buses and mo-
tor-cars apparently powered by some non-
atomic fuel plied the actual streets instead
of being confined to subways the skies
were almost empty of planes and those he
saw were incredibly clumsy and slow
there was obviously no freeway for heli-
copters

it was self-evident that he was in some
year of the remote past though just
which he had no idea he wished he had
taken time to glance at the ticket before he
handed it in he wished he had studied
history komikljooks or given more than a
cursory glance at the telescreen propin-
forms of ttt there was something to be
said after all for the general educational-
ists cranks as they were

  certainly this was not his los-his giant
citv stretching from mex to sanfran with-
out a break this was a little place of prob-
ably not much more than two million in-
habitants well here he was for a week
and hed better find out how he was going
to eat and sleep properly equipped time
travelers had money of the right period but
the cred checks in his pouch would do him
no good now what did he have on him
that could be exchanged for board and
lodging 

  only one object of undoubted value the
knife

  surreptitiously and with distaste he took
it out and looked at it the blood had dried
on it and doubtless left traces on the lining
of his pouch it was probably covered with
the fingerprints of the murderer as well as
with his own but it was all he had

  in the middle of the park there was a
fountain with a pool around it casually
mikel skot strolled over to it and sat down
on the ledge when he was sure nobody
was looking he dippecl the knife in the wa-
ter and scrubbed it dry on the inner hem
of his tunic there would still be traces of
blood which any chemist could find of
course but nolwdy here would be examin-
ing it for that since anyone could see that
it was of immense value he would have to
account for possession of it he could say
it was an heirloom

  putting it back in his pouch he ap-
proached a fat man on a bench nearby

  where is the nearest liistory museum
please citizen he asked politely

  the man looked up he had been scan-
ning a large piece of paper which mikel
with a thrill recognized from one of his
few visits to the museum of antiquities it
was a thing called a newspaper which had
antedated the tridimens telescreen he re-
membered that the specimens he had seen
had borne dates at the top and if he could
m	startling stories

read the archaic printing he could find out
what year it was but the man folded it up
and thrust it under his arms as he an-
swered

  history museum he echoed gosh
bud i dont know im a stranger here my-
self-just got in from kansas yesterday
you a foreigner he asked with frank
curiosity you got a funny accent and
you sure look funny

  a foreigner-that was a good one but
mikel had no time to waste he murmured
excuse and left the man stared after
him and made a gesture which mikel did
not understand-describing a circle in the
air near his forehead

  mikel walked to the edge of the little
park and looked about him across the
street was a store with newspapers in racks
in front of it he could go over there and
see the dates but what did it really mat-
ter with his ignorance of all but the
haziest generalities of history-he thought
that once thousands of years ago los had
belonged to the spaniards and after that
there was some kind of war that was maybe
called the american revolution or the
civil war or the world war he was not
sure which-it wouldnt do him much good
to know whether he was in say  or
 or  besides he was afraid to
cross that street full of clumsy vehicles and
with neither an overpass nor an underpass
nowhere could he see anything that resem-
bled a museum

farther down on the same side of the
street on which he stood he saw some-
thing that looked faintly promising he
walked down to it and found a window full
of odd-looking primitive objects the nature
of some of which he could not guess but
there were knives among them and a sign
said in ancient spelling jewelry bought
and sold on an impulse he walked in

  a man in another queer garment-some
kind of cloth upper with a white linen
thing beneath it and a ribbon tied around
his neck-looked up without surprise at
mikels literally untimely garb and said
yes sir

  mikel drew out the knife

  very valuable he said an heir-
loom how much will you give me

  the man shrank back not as if he were

afraid of the knife but as if he were sud
denly afraid of mikel

  you kidding me he asked or is thi
a stick-up

  mikel was not sure what the words
meant so he merely shook his head

  then are you nuts theres nothing
valuable about that thing its just an ordi-
nary kitchen knife

  not valuable mikels face fell but
look-wooden handle steel blade

  so what every knife has a wooden
handle and a steel blade

you will not give me money for it
of course not we dont buy junk
there was no use arguing one ages
antique is another ages junk mikel sighed
and departed quietly how was he to get
food and shelter for a week

  he went back to the park and sat down
again on a bench he put the knife back
in his pouch

  this was what came of panicking for the
first time in his humdrum life a sudden
image of the redheaded girl came before
his mind-her green eyes and her smile
that girl-she was so pretty-and she had
smiled at him whom girls never noticed
and then she had been killed now that it
was too late he wished he had stayed
whatever might have happened to him he
wanted to help to avenge her he wanted
to be home again

  his stomach reminded him sharply that
he had had no lunch he had never heard
how long a man could go without eating
could he even live through the week 

  he sat there disconsolately his eyes
fixed on the ground on his wrist was
sealed the little gadget that was his only
means of ever seeing  again

  somebody came and sat down beside
him deep in thought he did not even
glance up a voice said can you tell me
what time it is my watch is broken and
theres no clock around here

  watch-that meant to be alert
clock-that was an ancient time-meas-
uring device he thought the only way
mikel knew to tell the time was to glance
at the ceiling of any room or if he were
outdoors to tune in on his miniature tridi-
mens gadget attached to his belt he dialed
it now but there was no response of
course not-it wouldnt work across per-
time out for redheads	

haps a thousand years

  tin sorry he answered i cant
he turned as he spoke he jumped vio-
lently

  the speaker was a girl she had red hair
and green eyes otherwise there was no
resemblance though she too was pretty
but red hair and green eyes seemed to be
haunting him

  whats that thing on your left wrist
then asked the girl spunkily

mikel reddened rule five of the
booklets he handed out with the tick-
ets to all travelers leaped into his mind
remember vou cannot change the course
of history to avoid confusion and diffi-
culty avoid revealing to any person you
meet in other time-pcriods the true nature
of your presence there

  he broke the rule and was sorry at once
its a timeporter he said set for my
return home

  the girl laughed

  thats a god one i thought id heard
everything since i came to this crazy place
what are you an arab dressed in that
tablecloth 

  i was born right here in los mikel
announced with dignity ive always lived
here

  so they grow them crazy here right
from the tart then wheres your home
youre set to return to

  here in los

  the girl stood up hastily a look of alarm
on her face

  oh please mikel cried dont go i
can explain perhaps you can help me
she sat down again dubiously

  well im a sucker for a good story
she said shoot

  i-i wouldnt shoot i have no weap-
on

  that wasnt true-he did have a weap-
on  the knife but he could hardly mention
that anyway the girl only laughed again

  wisecracks yet she said unintelligi-
bly well whats the story

j	w	j

  i am from this place but i am not from
your time mikel began laboriously he
was utterly unaccustomed to social con-
versation with a woman i am from-
with me it is 

  what in the-look what are you adver-

tising some science fiction magazine
i dont understand that word-adver-
what is it  please believe me i shouldnt
tell vou im breaking a rule but it is
true	

  go on she fixed him with a skeptical
glance

  t was-i am a ticket-seller for time
travel tours this morning-i mean what
was to me this morning-a customer was
killed at my window

  he plunged ahead she listened in si-
lence a peculiar expression in her eyes

  so you see he concluded i am here
for a week but then i go back-the time-
porter will see to that i want to go-im
sorry i ran away but im sure the police
will say i did it because of the knife
lets see it

  he brought it out

  why thats just an ordinary kitchen
carving knife she said just as the man in
the store had done  i suppose you would
call it an antique in-what was it-
i still say youre haywire-or else this is
some new racket i dont get

  i dont understand

  okay i guess you wouldnt-in 
the language would change plenty in 
years once more her laugh rang out
ill say you keep it up fine-that funny
half-foreign way you pronounce your
words but ill play along and pretend
this is all on the up-and-up even so its
liaywire-crazy because the dumbest cop
in the world wouldnt suspect you of the
murder anybodyd know the murderer
just got rid of the knife the quickest way
lie could gosh you were behind your win-
dow werent you and she was in front of
it  where was her stab wound 

  wait-its hard for me to understand
cop-is that slang for jwlice and the
blood-he shuddered-came from her
side either someone in front or someone
behind her could have done it

  but theyll find out right away wont
they that you didnt know the girl theyll
find out who she was and theyll grill
everybody she knew to see who had a rea-
son lor wanting her out of the way   
listen to me im as big a nut as you are
im talking just as if the whole thing really
happened

  it did happen mikel assured her
	startling stories

earnestly no i didnt know her i dont
know any girls at all im-im not at-
tractive to women

  why youre not so had said the girl
kindly i thinl youre kind of cute-or
would he if you werent rigged up in those
outlandish clothes she paused then con-
tinued well if you can prove you didnt
know her what have you got to worry
about

  the knife and that i lost my head and
ran

the girl nodded leave the knife here
then or would that change the course
of history she smiled of course what
you ought to have done was hand it right
over then if it was such a great antique
theyd not only have the guys fingerprints
but theyd also find out who knew her that
worked in a museum or had a chance to
steal it from one thats elementary homi-
cide procedure

  you see said mikel this also you
wont believe but our police are not con-
ditioned to take care of killings this is
the first time in my whole life that i have
ever even heard of one except bv accident
the psychologists wouldnt allow anyone
to grow up who had murderous tendencies
that couldnt be sublimated

  they let that one slip by them didnt
they and do you mean that in the great
scientific future they tell us about the police
wont know as much about handling a
homicide case as any hick constable knows
today whore you trying to kid

  we do not have crime the police are
to guard traffic and to take up for recondi-
tioning anybody who doesnt obey the civil
rules i dont know much history but i
know there once were wars and then there
were experts in war now-in my time
-we have no wars so there are no experts
in the same way we have no experts in
crime 

  then what would they do to you if
they did convict you of this murder you
didnt commit

  i dont know there is no penalty for
murder because there have been no mur-
ders for so long this will be a world
affair the police will refer it to the su-
preme council and they will decide what
to do  suppose they will have me euthan-

ized as an atavistic deviant thats why i
lost my head it was a totally new ex-
perience and i havent been conditioned to
new experiences but even if they dont
convict me thev punish me for running
away theyll demote me perhaps all the
way back to where i started twelve years
ago

  it doesnt sound like much of a brave
new world to me said the girl in a dis-
paraging tone whats your name-or do
you just have numbers

  mv name is mikel skot

  michael scott-well that sounds like
a regular name anyway mines betty
french by the way

  many grats to you citizen french you
have given me good advice i know now
it is my duty to take the knife back with
me and give it to the police i shall tell
them also about looking for somebody in a
museum as you suggested but there will
be no fingerprints-i washed the knife in
that fountain when i hoped to sell it i
forgot it must rxist in my era or the mur-
der could not have occurred

  but that is not my big problem now
i have n money of your time how shall
 live until i can go home

tetty french seemed to stiffen
- she looked at him disgustedly i get
it now she said i might have known
this is just a new way of panhandling
i certainly admire it-its a work of art
well i got my moneys worth ill pay for
it 

  she opened her handbag drew out a
dollar bill and laid it on mikels knee he
gazed at it curiously but made no attempt
to pick it up

  is that your kind of money he asked
what do i do in exchange for it

   oh lets drop it she sighed wearily
my lunch-hours up anyway take it-
itll buy you a hamburger and coffee and
then you can tell your tale to the next
comer and maybe get enough for a bed
in a flophouse brother you must have
told it plenty to get it all down so pat
its a wonder ive missed you before-or
are you just starting to work this neighbor-
hood

  she snapped her bag shut and stood up
time out for redheads	

  please-i dont understand-why are
you so angry

  at the desperation in his voice she turned
and stopped

  look-i really have to get back to the
office this is an act isnt it come clean
-arent you panhandling

  what does panhandling mean

  oh  give up i guess youre just
looney after all all right mike lets call
it a day you keep that buck and now you
just go to the nearest police station and
tell them vour storv thevll take you over
to the psychiatric ward of the county hos-
pital and you can get free board and lodg-
ing there

  mikel turned pale and shivered

  oh no he breathed im not insane
if you dont believe me  one else will
and the hospital will euthanize me

  is that what they do to crazy people
in-in your time

  of course and they punish the psy-
chologist who didnt detect the tendency
and have the person euthanized in child-
hood

  suppose i give you my word they wont
do that to you here and now theyll just
observe you for a few days and then theyll
have you committeed to a state hospital
you are quite positive if i can be
sure of being alive a week from now no
matter where i am when the timeporter
checks ill go back home

  even if youre in a padded cell

  it wont matter where

  well then your problems solved isnt
it ill show you how to get to the sta-
tion

  i must eat first im very hungry and
what were those things you said if i should
get-hamburger and coffee they are-
original foods our food is all synthetic
you dont have to keep this up with
me any more theres a quick lunch place
she pointed

  and they wont mind in this autocaf
that im not dressed like the others

  in this burg they wouldnj notice if
you wandered around in a loincloth now
ive got to go this is the wackiest thing
that ever happened to me whatever it real-
ly means well good luck mike

  grats to you citizen french fror
deep in my pineal oh ucf one min
more please	v letclfr

  what is it now

  you have given me sc much to tell
our police but wont they wonder why
this man killed the girl

  they can ask him when they catch
them cant they but its perfectly ob-
vious she was buving a ticket wasnt
she

  yes certainly

  well that meant she was going away-
leaving him doesnt it so he was in love
with her-maybe she was his wife-and
he couldnt take it maybe she was going
to some other guy-how do i know he
found out she was deserting him so he
got hold of the knife and followed her
but i dont see why mikel was utter-
ly bewildered she was a free agent like
anybody else he couldnt object to her
leaving if she no longer loved him-he
didnt orvn her that doesnt make sense
if i tell one of our police that theory she
will surely think im insane

  she

  all our police are women of course
women are naturally gifted at keeping
order

  you tell that to our cops and theyll
surely get you tucked away in a nice hos-
pital but fast well why else would he
kill her

  i dont know thats why  asked you
-you know so much more about such
things in your barb-in your time

  your policewoman will have to figure
it out for herself so long mike she
shook her head smiling will i have a
tale to tell the crowd-if they dont decide
ive gone nuts myself good-by

  goobie citizen and grats again

  still smiling she hurried down the path
out of the park

tvhen he could see her no longer mi-
w kel stood up and began hesitantly to
walk toward the restaurant she had pointed
out fortunately it was on the same side
of the street not far past the shop where
he tried to sell the knife

  this was not going to be plez not at
m	startling stories

 pier	what this beti french

had toh hiij  was nervous about putting
m  in th hands of either the police
jt psychologist of this barbarous era but
there didnt seem to be anything else he
could do kis conversation with the red-
headed girl had shown him clearly what
mnd of reception he would meet from any-
one else he ventured to approach

  first he must eat-he was ravenous he
dared not ask for any food except the two
things the girl had mentioned whatever
they were like presumably the money she
had given him would be enough

  the restaurant had a long counter of
some white substance with stools fixed be-
fore it only one man sat there eating but
behind it stood another man dressed in
white with a white cap on his head mikel
perched himself on the nearest stool

  hamburger coffee please he said
and laid betis money beside him on the
counter

  the other customer looked up and eyed
him sharply but the man behind the coun-
ter merely yelled one on a bun through
a hole in the wall mustard he asked
onions cream

  no citizen hamburger coffee mi-
kel repeated flustered

  a joker the man grunted this
town you in the movies bud

   mikel stared

  he wants a burger without and coffee
with the other customer put in sudden-
ly he picked up his dishes and slid down
to the next stool he was a heavy-set mid-
dle-aged man dressed as the man in the
store had been-in dark cloth bifurcated
leg-eoverings and a dark long-sleeved up-
per garment over a light-colored under-
garment with a gaudy ribbon around his
neck

  okay okay said the man in white
placatingly and set down before mikel
something on a plate and something else
in a cup both hot mikel began sampling
them gingerly with the unaccustomed im-
plements the restaurant man took the
money put it in a box that rang a bell and
laid down some small metal objects in its
place then he disappeared through a door
behind the counter

  mikels neighbor waited until he had
gone then in a low voice he said

  finish the food citizen skot then
well talk

  mikel looked up frozen the stranger
shot his left wrist out from the sleeve
sealed to it was a timeporter

  from ttt executive citizen he
said briskly i didnt think id find you
quite so soon but i knew it wouldnt be
long since you didnt wait to get proper
equipment for your journey it is fort for
you that this is perhaps the only place in
this era where you would not have been
taken up at sight for wandering around in
unusual clothing

  how-how did you know what pe-
riod-

  we only had to check the tickets to see
which was missing have you the knife

mikel brought it out dumbly and laid
it on the counter the man put it in
a pouch sewed into his lower garment

  i didnt do it i didnt mikel cried
despairingly he had lost his appetite com-
pletely

  sh we dont want a fuss here i am
rechecking your timeporter citizen skot
we are going back immediately

  i-i didnt even know the girl mikel
pleaded remembering beti frenchs in-
structions

  we shall see as to that when we get
home said the ttt executive grimly

  then suddenly he burst out laughing
he laughed until he had to take a small
piece of white material from his upper gar-
ment and wipe his eyes

  i meant to give you a good scare to
put some sense into you he gasped final-
ly but i cant keep it up citizen skot
you are a fool

  i know that citizen said mikel hum-
bly

  the psychologists really conditioned
you a bit too well  am told that you
live for your work and have no recreation
at all you are as ignorant of the world
as a small child come did you ever hear
of a murder in our time anywhere in all
your life

no but i know such things occur
in the past not in our time how could
there be a murder in our era in the old
times people killed one another for jeal-
time out for redheads



ousy for revenge for greed such incen-
tives do not exist in the th century the
only other possibility would be insanity
and the psychologists would never allow
that to proceed to such a point-the dis-
eased person would be euthanized at the
very first symptoms

  but the girl was killed right before my
eyes

  my poor man you were a victim of
your own ridiculously retired existence
anyone else would have guessed at once
it was planned that way so as to get a
good effect of a crowd in confusion-most
of them were extras of course all the ar-
rangements had been made with us be-
forehand and the concealed telcatns were
focused away from any time travel signs

  telecams

  world theater was making a histor-
ical crime tridimens in modern dress citi-
zen skot the girl was an actress the
blood was faked they thought it would be
more effective not to put an actor behind
the ticket-window but to use a real ticket-
seller without warning him just as part
of the crowd wasnt warned it worked
beautifully-they tell me your fright and
horror showed up wonderfully well

  they picked your window because they
said they liked your looks-i cant imagine
why that was their big mistake any
other of our ticket-sellers would have wait-
ed to see what happened next you you
dumble fell into a panic and ran away

and ive had to leave my desk in the mid-
dle of a busy aftern to go and fetch you
we couldnt let you wander around here
for a week without means of subsistence
and thinking you were suspected of mur-
der

  i suppose ill be demoted now mikel
said gloomily

  that wouldnt be fair this wasnt one
of the known responsibilities of your posi-
tion no but i imagine youll come in for
a lot of whiffing to use a slang expression
kidding-thats what they call it here
i think well im used to that

  and dafne dart says shes wild to meet
you

  dafne dart whos she mikel look-
ed alarmed again

  your performance made a tremend im-
pression on her she told me to tell you
she thinks youre purely vlumpish shes
the actress who played the murder victim
that red-haired girl with the green
eyes with flecks of amber in them asked
mikel eagerly with the streely smile and
the gorge voice

  you seem to have noticed her said
the ttt executive dryly yes thats the
one i thought you didnt go for women
but thats different mikel skot ca-
roled redheads with green eyes-thats
the one kind that crashes me and that i
crash-i just found it out today

  come on citizen what are we waiting
for lets go

earnest intellectuals but leo is my
manager what he decides i should do
i do

  being seen at this brain brawl will
be smart box office freddy leo told
me you can use a little high-brow
publicity

   i could have used a little premonition
and second sight too it would have kept
me from getting mixed up with panda
the beautiful phd it would have kept
me from taking that fatal fall to dr
stanley macciuetts synthetic symbiotic
wave i could have gone on for the rest
of my life being the same old obnoxious
freddy booten

  thats my legal name - freddy
booten professionally i am known as
don diablo this is because i am sup-
posed to look very sinister i have basi-
lisk black eyes a satanic-type vandyke
and i am all over with muscle i am
what is very loosely termed a wrestler

  very very loosely on any given
day you can pick up at least a hundred
heavies around and about the country
who can easily whip me no hands the
reason they consistently refrain from do-
ing this is merely because promoters
dearly love to amass money time and
time again cash customers will come
back to the arena in the hopes of seeing
some clean-cut american kid twist me
up like a cruller

  this never happens of course what
happens is i leave the clean-cut ameri-
can kid writhing in frightful agony on
the canvas sneering horribly a red
nylon robe tossed rakishly around my
shoulders i make my victory strut up
the aisle while i strut and sneer kind-
ly old ladies try to beat me to death with
their canes i am indeed a very obnox-
ious character

  being obnoxious never bothered me
it was i always figured a fast way to
stack a buck on top of a buck in a year
or two if some kindly old lady didnt
maim me first id have enough to retire
to my pig farm back in fishhook illi-
nois im proud of that pig farm peo-
ple may detest me but i get along fine
with pigs were real compatible

the party leo picked out for me to

  attend that night was being held in

one of those mansions which come
equipped with their own private moun-
tain it was jammed clear to the up-
stairs maid with artists swamis and
people and i was prepared to have a
very dull night what i wasnt prepared
for was to meet panda

  at the time i didnt know thats who
she was all i knew was suddenly here
was this spectacular girl with the glossy
white streak in her satin black hair
standing in front of me she had an
orange juice and vodka in one hand and
an expression of mild revulsion on her
beautiful face

  i can tell by that silly beard youre a
male she snarled but a male what

  then she reached up and dumped the
orange juice and vodka over me

  it wasnt anything to get sore about
lots of women throw drinks at me im
used to it by now when it happens i
merely draw myself up to my full six-
feet-four and drip disdainfully down on
the drink-tosser then i stalk away if
theres a photographer around i pause
and lash my beard a couple of times for
the camera it is leo says very smart
box office

  it wasnt anything to get sore about
but thats what i did something sput-
tered in my head and i broke out in
flame without even bothering to clear
it with my conscience i- lifted a foot and
planted it on the girls instep not hard
enough to break any bones you under-
stand  just enough pressure to cause her
to shriek in mortal anguish

  that shriek got a rousing reaction
those earnest intellectuals suddenly
came boiling toward me in a red wave
of wrath there was a scrawny blonde
built like the ruins of pompeii in the
lead

  let me have him girls i heard that
scrawny blonde whinny ten years ago
i took some jujutsu lessons to help pro-
tect me from men now i want to see if
i wasted my money

  i guess she never did find out if she
wasted her money before she could get
her girlish talons into me some lily-
livered flunky pulled the main light
switch

  in the thick darkness i barreled my
	startling stories

way through the screaming mob i didnt
stop until i climbed into my car some-
body plopped down into the seat beside
me just as i hit the starter

  better roll it out of here fast a
girls voice yipped excitedly in my ear
theres a berserk gorilla loose in
there

  i wanted to explain that the berserk
gorilla wasnt loose in there any more
i wanted to say look sis that berserk
gorilla is me but judging from the
way the riot was building up i just
didnt have the time to spare i rolled
out of there fast

  it wasnt until we swung into the
lighted boulevard that i realized i had
picked up the furious little female with
the striped hair

  she recognized me at the same in-
stant yipes she squalled the
bearded gargantua she drew back
her fool and aimed a quick kick at my
shin her open-toed sandal whizzed by
my leg and thudded into the dashboard
she grabbed her foot and squalled some
more crumpled it up like a balsa
kite she screeched bones sticking
out all over stop this chartreuse tum-
brel  let me out of here

  i stopped the car the mood she was
in i felt she just wasnt safe to have
around

  i dont want to rush you sis i said
but therell probably be a broom com-
ing along any minute maybe if you
crawl out fast you can grab a ride
home

  -she counted up to ten cooling off
faster than a strip-teaser in a drafty
igloo

  this is ridiculous she sputtered
why is it i keep blowing my top like
this

  i was beginning to feel sorry for her
after all it wasnt her fault  was so
obnoxious dont let it throw you i
sighed youre merely acting normal
everybody hates me

she stopped massaging her foot and
turned to stare incredulously at me
everyixjdy she gasped

  i nodded including kindly old ladies
and small dogs i said i mean i

wasnt boasting or anything just try-
ing to paint a clear picture for her

  she thought it over carefully i could
see an idea begin to form in her big
brown eyes

  this is remarkable she murmured
this is really remarkable mind driv-
ing around a bit

  while i drove around she told me
about herself her name she said was
marsha carson though her friends all
called her panda she worked for the
keevan research foundation her boss
was dr stanley maccluett the famous
bio-electronicist who was presently do-
ing some important work on waveform
mutuality

  i have a very good reason for filling
you in on all this background material
she went on to explain because of the
type of biological electronic research we
are carrying on at keevan i feel i am in
an excellent position to offer a logical
explanation as to why everybody finds
you so detestable

  i told her there wasnt any mystery
alxnit that i am detestable i said

  she nodded somberly youre an
abominable cluck and thats a mink-
lined fact she agreed but this is in
 way your fault you are simply an
unfortunate victim of an extreme varia-
tion from the electric norm you have
what we bio-electronicists call a rogue
symbiotic waveform 

  she could be right biq-electronics
was a little out of my line i didnt feel
i knew enough about the subject to
argue

  what throwsme i said is why 
should reciprocate your revulsion i
mean ordinarily i am a sort of good-
natured slob i dont often get mad-
not even at kindly old ladies

  it seemed panda also had a theory
about that this antagonism un-
doubtedly stems from the fact that we
are at opposite ends of the symbiotic
scale she said we are a hundred per
cent incompatible

  we drove around for a couple of
hours before dropped her off at her
apartment in santa monica when i
finally left i found i was committed to
escorting her down to long beach
the rogue waveform

where i was wrestling that next night
i wanted that date the way a guy on his
way to the electric chair wants to sit
down

  the long beach match turned out to
be one of my best performances the
sight of panda sitting there in the front
row her face contorted in a livid mask
of hatred was positively inspiring
when i finally made my victors march
up the aisle the place was a howling
bedlam

  those kindly old ladies were leaping
from seat to seat like spindle-legged
tarzans

  leo was all molars by the time we got
back down to the dressing room
freddy he chortled tonight you
were great i hear the tv switchboard
is jammed with people calling up to
swear they will slay you on sight but
slow and painful

  i told leo t was happy to learn i was
such a success

  you have never been nastier he
assured me expansively it must be
that dame with the striped hair who was
sitting at ringside she had a high-tone
way of screaminer for your blood that
was very smart box office maybe i
should step out and give her a couple of
free ducats

  i told leo lie neednt bother i dont
think panda wants any free ducats i
said

  he looked surprised you mean you
are acquainted with this piebald babe
freddy

  she came with me i admitted
glumly shes a phd andshe lives in
santa monica

  freddy he murmured shaking his
head in honest admiration sometimes
i think you are a much smarter boy than
i always figured what an act your girl
put  tonight

  she wasnt acting leo i said she
really hates me

  freddy he groaned still shaking
his head sometimes i think maybe you
are a much stupider boy than i always
figured you drive this girl up route
one-o-one tonight and tomorrow your
body will no doubt wash up on the rocks
at redondo



 wasnt so sure he wasnt right i
wasnt so sure panda wasnt prowling
around the parking area now a fire ax
in each hand

  as it turned out she was sitting quiet-
ly in my car you unspeakable beast
she greeted me when i climbed in it
was the most restrained statement she
had made all evening

  on our way up the coast we stopped
at a seafood restaurant in some of
these roadside joints you can some-
times pick up a lobster loaded with
ptomaine but either panda was im-
mune to ptomaine or else i was just un-
lucky that night

  it was while we were in the restaurant
that panda made the request that was to
ruin my career freddy she said
squinting thoughtfully at me i wonder
if you would do me a favor

  i hesitated i wanted to be polite but
i wasnt going to cut my throat with any
knife favor i repeated cautiously

  she nodded i wronder if you would
stop in at the keevan foundation and let
dr maccluett type your symbiotic
waveform we may be able to get a
waveshape picture of the enmity factor
in its pure form such a study might
lead to the unlocking of the riddle of the
antipathy some ethnic groups instinc-
tively hold for others this might easily
turn out to be the dawn of a new era

  well as long as she put it that way
i didnt see how i could refuse i figure
if theres one thing this world can use
its the dawn of a new era

  and so that is how i happened to be
at the keevan research foundation
early that next evening

  the famous dr stanley maccluett
came as a complete surprise to me i was
expecting a stoop-shouldered old gentle-
man in bifocals but he turned out to be
about my age and almost as big he had
a granite jaw and brilliant blue eyes that
lit up like a pinball machine whenever
he glanced at panda he seemed to
glance at panda a lot

  the good doctor opened up the pro-
ceedings that evening by giving me a
rapid-fire briefing on mutuality he
wfent all the way back to the planarian
worms and worked his way up to the
	startling stories

primates he explained that it was his
theory that the pattern of all social be-
havior was determined by a complicated
meshing of symbiotic waves according
to him these waves held the key to the
urge of kind to mate with kind they
were the basis of all physical attraction
and all physical antipathy it was very
scientific i never understood a word

  when he finished the briefing he led
me into a small lab that looked like a
cross between the cockpit of a b- and
an operating room for midgets there
was a big contour chair in the center of
the lab

  sit in the chair freddy panda or-
dered

  i sat in the chair but i was beginning
to get worried

  look i said narrowing my eyes
and steeling my voice just in case
something goes wrong id like to leave
a few words for posterity id like to
state that i am proud to-

  stop blubbering freddy panda
snapped giving me a look that would
have carved a duck this isnt going
to hurt

  she was right dr maccluett said
all they were going to do was use a
radio electroencephalograph on me that
radio electroencephalograph was just a
series of modified fm transmitters
which they were going to set up around
me those transmitters would pick up
my wave patterns and transmit them
over to that receiver in the corner that
receiver would flash the pattern to that
oscilloscope beside it i would be as safe
as a baby in its mothers arms safer
even those fm transmitters werent
going to drop hot cigarette ashes on me
they werent going to drip gin in my
eyes

  just lean back and relax dr mac-
cluett finished

  i leaned back and tried to relax those
fm transmitters i had an idea were
going to have their ioh cut out for them
that oscilloscope was probably going to
turn out to be the blankest oscilloscope
in the country

the way it is im more familiar with
appearing on tv than on radio i

felt lost without a camera pointing at me

  you want me to suffer a little i
asked uncertainly you want me to
lash my beard a few times

  dr maccluett gave me an unfriendly
glance

  for a while i sat there and watched
them out of the corners of my eyes then
i began to get restless again

  you reading me all right dr mac-
cluett i called

  he didnt bother to answer just went
on staring at that oscilloscope this is
remarkable i heard him mutter we
must make a photographic record of
this thus must primitive mans wave-
form have appeared when he was forced
to battle the hairy mammoth

  i decided i ought to put the doctor
straight on that point i didnt want to
ruin the start of a new era with any
misconceptions

  dr maccluett i got to tell you
something i said i never battled a
hairy mammoth in all my life couple of
years ago i wrestled a bear in a carnival
but i never laid a finger on a hairy mam-
moth in all my life

  he didnt bother to comment on that
either he just went on staring and
muttering

  i was beginning to build up a back
pressure of curiosity finally it got to
be too much for me you mind if i step
over and take a peek i called out i
mean those were my brain waves they
were looking at i wanted to be sure they
were cleaned up and cleared for trans-
mission

  panda spun around freddv dont
you dare move she yipped how can
you possibly step over and look at your
own brain waves

  when i thought it over it didnt seem
logical i guess it would be like climbing
a ladder to see the top of your head i
decided it wasnt anything to start a war
about

  i dont know what sort of rating i
would have picked up on that first show
but i must have impressed dr mac-
cluett anyway he invited me to come
back again that next day

during the following weeks i suppose
i must have appeared at the foundation
the rogue waveform



at least a dozen times i was even be-
ginning to draw a small studio audience
scientists from all over the country came
around to stare thoughtfully at me and
to ask me probing questions i dont
know maybe they figured i must have
sneaked down from mars any day now
i expected the fbi to drop in and ask
me where id hid my saucer

  on the nights i wasnt wrestling i got
in the habit of going places with panda
she said she wanted to record the reac-
tions of the unwary human horde to my
nauseating personality

  as long as i didnt have anything else
to do i didnt mind but i could tell dr
maccluett was beginning to resent these
field trips couple of times i caught him
giving me a sort of measuring stare it
reminded me of the way that bear in the
carnival used to look at me-like he
wished he could get his muzzle off

  i mentioned this to panda that dr
maccluett doesnt like my going out
with you so often i told her im mak-
ing him jealous

  she almost broke herself up with girl-
ish glee over that oh brother she
shrieked how could anybody possibly
get jealous of you freddy

  she had a good point it didnt sound
reasonable all the same i insisted
that dr maccluett is getting jealous

  she told me to stop worrying about it
ill handle the good doctor she said
it was like a kid with a toy blaster tell-
ing you hed handle that armored col-
umn

  the very next day the good doctor
lowered the boom on me panda was
lecturing at some womans club out in
pomona when it happened i hadnt
planned on appearing at the foundation
that afternoon but dr maccluett called
up and asked me if i would stop in he
sounded so genial i decided panda must
have informed him he now loved me like
a brother

for once there were no visiting neu-
rologists waiting in the lab in fact
there w-as nobody there but dr mac-
cluett

  freddy he said opening hostilities
with a big false smile i have one final

experiment i would like to perform on
you ive been holding it back to the last
because it may be a bit rough

  i asked him how rough did he mean
i said im wrestling down at the pier
tonight and i cant go on that card with
a broken leg i go on that card with a
broken leg and those kindly old ladies
will part my head right down the mid-
dle

  this experiment will involve no
hazard to limb he assured me his smile
turning somewhat bleak and it may
prove to be of great scientific impor-
tance

  well i thought as long as it was for
science i ought to do it after all
science has done a lot for me if it
wasnt for science id probably be
crouched in a cold cave gnawing on a
raw buffalo i wanted science to know
i was grateful

  since my last visit to the foundation
i noticed the doctor had added another
piece of equipment it was set up beside
the contour chair it looked like one of
those analyzers they use in garages to
check motor performance there was a
long metal barrel sticking out from it
that barrel pointed directly at my head
when i sat down in the chair

  dr maccluett i said if youve
got this gun loaded maybe you better
not aim it at my head i am liable to
dull that bullet

  this instrument is not a gun he
grunted making a micrometer adjust-
ment he sighted down the barrel and
added its a symbiotic waveshape
modifier

  the doctor hadnt been kidding when
he said that experiment was going to be
rough one moment i was sitting there
big-wheeling civilization on to the dawn
of a new era the next moment a squa-
dron of jet bombers started roaring
through my skull

  dr maccluett was waving a bottle of
spirits of ammonia under my nose when
i finally opened my eyes

  you all right freddy he asked in
a quavering voice

  i staggered to my feet i had a head-
ache that would have dropped an ele-
phant in its tracks a team of rough
	startling stories

maulers couldnt have done a better job
on me with claw holds

  im fine i groaned matching him
quaver for quaver the only reason i
look this way is merely because i am
dying

  by dint of much heaving and tugging
he managed to haul me out to my car and
boost me into it

  he appeared as nervous as a neophyte
murderer trying to get his first corpse
under cover

  drive carefully freddy he said
stepping back he pulled out a white
handkerchief and waved it gently look
both ways when you cross wilshire
please watch out for dangerous pedes-
trians

  leo was waiting for me in my dress-
ing room that evening he gave me an
anxious scrutiny you feel all right
freddy he inquired solicitously you
want i should get you an aspirin you
want i should hold a cold cloth on your
head

  i had to look twice to be sure this was
leo talking to me any other time i
could be lying flat on my face i could be
bleeding out of all my arteries and leo
would probably try to boot me to my
feet freddy he would probably say
what are you a hypochondriac but
here he was clucking over me like a hen
over a newborn egg

  the rest of the evening was strictly a
nightmare out of -d by technicolor i
walked down the aisle and there wasnt a
single solitary boo in the place so help
me there was only this soft pulsing
sigh like a steel guitar stuck on blue
hawaii

the pulsing sigh faded to a breath-
less hush when i climbed through the
ropes then suddenly this kid redhead
in shorts and store curves leaped to her
feet

  oh you great big beautiful doll
you she yipped waving her popcorn
at me

  from then on things got real pitiful
i was supposed to be wrestling a guy
named arnie kapowsky amie never
wrestled any way but hero-style and the
crowd broke his heart that night

 what happened was each time i
started to massage arnies eyeballs with
my thumbs the crowd whooped with
delight and each time arnie worked
into a hold such as would be perfectly
permissible on any dance floor in the
country those kindly old ladies scram-
bled through the ropes and whanged
him with their canes

  arnie finally terminated this loath-
some exhibition by lying down and
covering his head with his arms either
that crowd had to cheer fair or arnie
wasnt going to play

  i dont want to linger any longer on
that match it is something better for-
gotten by one and all it is a black and
infamous blot buried now in the pages
of wrestling history let us leave it
there

  leo waited until we were back in the
dressing room before blowing his top
freddy he screeched what dis-
gusting thing have you done have you
rescued some blonde who was going
down in the briny deep for the ninth
time

  i told leo no i try to save a blonde
from drowning i said and shell
scream high-c for a shark to come and
protect her

  then have you pulled some tiny
toddler out from under the wheels of a
careening and malignant truck leo
screeched

  itold leo no i try to pull some kid
out from under a truck i said and
hes liable to bite off my right arm all
the way up to my left ear

 then how come that crowd was
cheering on your side leo howled
why were they drooling with affection
for you 

  i couldnt explain it iwas complete-
ly confused

  if id have had a bit more time to
think it over i might have been able to
figure it out but it wasnt until this
cop brought panda down to my dressing
room that i found out just what had
happened

  freddy this cop said sticking his
head in theres a young babe with
striped hair out here this young babe
is a very excited young babe she says
the rogue

she has to see you

  panda pushed her way in before i
could answer her face was almost as
white as that distinctive streak in her
hair

  freddy she squealed are you all
right

  i was getting fed up with that ques-
tion it just wasnt normal for people
to keep asking it of course im all
right i snapped	

  but freddy she wailed he might
have killed you

  i had to laugh you mean arnie

i snickered why arnie wouldnt hurt
a fly besides its against the rules for
clean-cut american kids to wrestle
rough

  i mean dr maccluett she squalled
that was a very dangerous operation
he performed on you he might have
done an irreparable injury to your poor
little brain

  in all my life i had never heard such
a silly statement

  panda i got to tell you something

i sighed even that bear in that carni-
val couldnt damage my brain he beat
both paws to a pulp on my head and
then said to hell with it we used to call
that bear old limpy 

  she didnt appear to be paying an
awful lot of attention to what i was say-
ing dr maccluett confessed every-
thing she went on in a tremulous voice
he really was jealous of you so he
decided to modify your waveform he
used an ultrasonic beam to perform a
sort of transorbital lobotomy and make
you lovable

tt didnt seem like a strictly sensible
a thing for a smart man like dr mac-
cluett to do still i guess having a high
iq doesnt necessarily guarantee a man
against being a complete jerk in certain
things

  why diat poor stupid genius i
chuckled

  leo let out a strangled roar freddy
he bellowed what is this pinto phd
saying is she saying you have let some
wacky scientist tamper with your putrid
personality

  that wacky scientist had tampered all

waveform	

right there wasnt much point in deny-
ing it so i just raised my eyebrows like
a furry pair of humpbacked japanese
bridges

  panda drew a long suddering breath
and began to close in on me when dr
maccluett made that wave shift she
murmured he overlooked the fact that
there is but a very thin line separating
love and hate he- she reached up
suddenly and slipped her arms around
my neck oh-h-h fred-dy she
cooed

  it was a pleasant sensation i mean it
was a sort of change from having drinks
sloshed over you for a moment there
i began to think science was wonderful
i still hadnt had time to realize my
career had just gone down in flames i
still didnt know what an appalling ex-
perience being a lovable character was
going to turn out to be

  i found out oh brother how i found
out

  twice during the next week leo ar-
ranged matches for me and twice
those kindly old ladies surged through
die ropes to protect me

  for awhile i kept hoping my new
personality would wear off like a hang-
over but it kept getting stronger and
stronger if i ran a stop light some cop
would roar up and apologize for that
lights being red if i stepped into a bar
to order a drink the bartender would
beat his forehead in anguish freddy
hed scream you got to take better
care of your stomach dont drink that
slop i beg you

  even my pigs were affected by my
new waveform the time i flew back to
illinois to check on my farm those pigs
chased me clear out of the county
nipped at my heels and bayed like
beagles those pigs did

  i	wasnt too upset about it i planned
on selling the farm anyway now that
im in the diplomatic service  wont
have much time for pig farming being
the ambassador to russia is a big job
and im worried about it i dont know
whether ill like having all those cos-
sacks call me uncle freddy i dont
know what ill do with the kremlin
when they give it to me   
hot and happy bugs

        by albert rosenfeld

                        los alamos science reporter

   meet zoog plutonium-eater with a radiant personality

ls no ac-
g for tastes
though they
int for the
taste of one
member of
il kingdom
j ramigcra
s scientists
for it the
n question
has a sweet tooth for
plutonium not only can zooglea sop up
the stuff like a sot drinking seagrams but
he doesnt even show signs of a radioactive
hangover

  one micromilligram ot plutonium in a
liter of water or about one part in a tril-
lion would be poison for a man-but not
for friend zoog

  actually no one knows for sure whether
zoog really eats the plutonium or not but
its an undeniable fact that he takes it in
and hangs onto it this habit of zoogs
his hoarding of gamma rays alpha parti-
cles and the like fits in very nicely with
the plans of los alamos engineers who had
been trying for some time to find a more
suitable method for disposing of radioactive
waste from water zoog laps it up like a
greedy alcoholic

  but how did aec engineers john f
newell and c w christenson find out
about zoogs radioactive feeding habits
and what made them decide to try includ-
ing some plutonium in zoogs diet to see
whether or not hed be able to keep the stuff
on his infinitesimal tummy-or whatever he
uses in place of one well there were
three factors involved

  to begin with its been known for a long
time-especially through the work of bac-

teriologists like e r buchanan and c t
butterfield-that zoog when used in vari-
ous sewage-disposal processes possessed
absorptive adsorptive and assimilative
characteristics which is a scientific way of
saying that zoog is a pig-hell eat any-
thing next scientists knew that the gela-
tinous mass in which zoog lives and thrives
is high in protein and there is a great
affinity between protein and heavy metals
like plutonium and finally it was com-
mon knowledge that plutonium tends to be
concentrated by algae in streams

  consequently the los alamos scientists
connected with radioactive waste-disposal
problems went into a huddle and decided
to see if zoogs appetite would balk at hav-
ing plutonium added to his menu zoog
without turning a hairlet took it in stride
and it looks like hell be in steady rations
from here on out

  zoog and all his tiny relatives live 
small rocks about one to four inches in di-
ameter water-soaked with material which
can be used as food a pile of rocks is set
up in a container for use as a trickle filter
oogs huge family clusters around the
rocks gelatinously and when the water
drips through the whole clan digs into the
radioactive material and only a very little
bit of it gets aw-ay

  of course plutonium alone could hardly
satisfy the hearty appetite of a zoog he is
also fed regularly  flour sugar water
and ammonium phosphate-not to mention
a supply of oxygen without which zoog
would die

  since zoog takes in only ninety or
ninety-five percent of the plutonium present
in radioactive waste water the water must
be trickled through several of the zoog-
filled filters before it can go safely on its

   here
countin
-and even
cant accov
the strange
particular
the bacteria
the zoogln
los alamt
are grateful
bacterium i
way and zoog seems very happy with
the set-up since the supply is as inexhausti-
ble as a dogpatch ham

  the zoog earns his keep for a con-
crete example of the service he performs
lets take a group of men working around
dangerous areas wearing certain protective
clothing the clothing is laundered with
decontaminants in water solution this
laundry waste then is radioactive it
doesnt contain enough plutonium to make
recovery economically feasible but it does
contain more than enough to be dangerous
the plutonium tends to accumulate in the
bones especially in the marrow if its taken
into the human body this danger does not
worry zoog because he like the banana has
no bones

   formerly if we took a thousand-gallon
sample of this laundry waste it had to be
poured into a huge pit where it soaked
through sand and gravel then more sand
and gravel and finally seeped out into a
nearby canyon-which then had to be
fenced off zoog however now makes it
possible to let the water go safely on its
way just like any other water its -true
that this system still leaves the problem of
the plutonium-laden zoogleal sludge the
hot bugs to get rid of but that is less
than two-tenths of one percent of the vol-
ume-or two gallons instead of a thousand
gallons to worry about and this two-gal-
lon quantity can be further concentrated
probably to less than a pint by incineration

   since its considered extremely unlikely
that zoog and his breathren-the hottest
happiest set of bugs youll find anywhere-
would ever concentrate plutonium in re-
coverable quantities chances are that no
bacterial emetic will have to be devised to
make them spit it up

   in any case zoog seems well on his way
to becoming the most radiant personality in
the southwest

blackboard jungle

by ronald e frazier

  dear editor i have been a silent fan for a
year and a half but have decided that now is the
time to strike at tev-while the typewriter is
hot

  first a biography one day because the rest
of my english class did i wandered into the
school library now said the teacher every-
one will select a book the others rushed to
the bookshelves and i sat down in a chair and
looked disgusted the teacher hauled her 
pounds daintily over to me and said didnt you
hear me

   heard you i said looking at a blonde on
the other side of the room

  why dont you get a book then asked the
teacher who could probably win the title of miss-
bem-of-any-year

  i humored her and went to one of the book-
shelves since the period would soon be over any-
way while staring boredly at the array of hard-
covers something caught my eyes it was called
a treasury - science fiction and
was edited by something called a groff conklin

  i was intrigued hmmmm i thought maybe it
wouldnt hurt to read just one story i read one

i read two i read the whole book i read every
anthology in the school library then every one
in the public library then one fateful day i
bought a mag then two now i buy every one
except maybe one or two

  recently i have been trying to write stf but
so far i have received nothing but rejection slips

  now one or two questions i read recently in a
 issue of ss or tws im not sure which
that alexander samalman is not a penname for
anyone but an individual entity then converse-
ly i read in fantasy-times that he was a house
name for your mags which if either is true-
-nd st richmond california

  sorry to trim your letter boh but for-
tunes of publishing you know as for your
question-alexander samalman is very
real indeed im looking at him at the mo-
ment of writing this comment ugh
hes senior editor of all our mags sci-
ence fiction western mystery and love

speaking of love-we loved the following
letter

two for the money

by jim harmon

  dear editor to an experienced hand like you
this will probably bring a chuckle but i had to
blink back tears when i saw the cover of the
spring startling stories i hadnt heard
about the combination before damn it i grew
up on thrilling wonder stories and
spent my allowance on back issues and i was
tickled a rosy shade of pink when fantastic
story magazine came out as the long
awaited third pardner of ss and tws it may
be corn but its the truth it hurt me to see
them shrunk down to a sub-title on another old
friend startling

  at least we have ss left and while  know
combined with sub-titles are usually dropped
after a few issues i hope youll keep those titles
up there until maybe by some miracle you can
uncombine them into the old magazines once
more i wonder if it would even be possible to
use small reproductions of the logos of tws and
fsm on the covers during the war for a time
ffm and fn were issued in one magazine with
both titles full size i realize you have to have
one short dominant title but it would be nice to
see the old title cuts

  and since i believe fsm had the edge on
circulation i would like to see the hall of
fame revived it was one of my favorite fea-
tures in the old ss the low quantity of reprints
made for high quality due to high selectivity

  one thing though there is a tradition of edi-
tors leveling with their readers in science fiction
it started when hugo gernsback admitted that the
new paper he was using in amazing stor-
ies was cheaper than the old bulky weave after
going through the regular routine of going to the
expense of getting a new better type of paper as
a joke its been carried on up till the present-
reiss and osullivan admitting that poor sales
were forcing them to cut planet from a bi-
monthly to a quarterly you cut tws and fsm
because you had troubles not as any noble experi-
ment everybody knows that

  theres another tradition the editor appealing
directly to his readers for help if you wont do
this yourself let me do it in the letter section

  to everyone who loves science fiction yes
damn it i mean people who are emotional about
it and who like startling-wonder-
fantastic story-if you want to help this
fine magazine in the face of a lot of competition
from get-rich-quick boys past and present buy
two copies of each issue one you can read and
keep the other mint science fiction magazines
become more valuable to scores of collectors
as time goes by in a few years those extra copies
will be worth  and in time si you can
almost always dispose of a science fiction magazine
at cover price ii you dont believe me after one
year if you want to sell then i personally jim
harmon will reclaim an extra copy at cover
value from each reader

  thats one way to help ss-tws-fsm a
second way is to hunt around for it on the
newsstands and if it isnt displayed prominently
move it to a good position yourself usually the
dealer wont notice or mind if he says anything
or starts to move the stack back tell him you
have a story in the issue and it would be a per-
sonal favor to keep it displayed ive been doing
this for almost all science fiction magazines for
years and have been called on it only once or
twice- east th st ml cariml iii

  atta boy were feeling mighty healthy
and with fans like you how can we lose
as for the hall of fame were giving its
revival a great deal of thought-but so far
theres been no rush of letters indicating
public opinion is forit perhaps most of
the fans want new stuff eh lets hear
about it and lets get on to the next let-
ter which is the con to trina perlsons

ancient theme

by maston e james

  dear editor bryce waltons story too
late for eternity had an ancient theme with a
vital emotional style built around it he is one
of the few contemporary pulp fictionists who can
really write this story is horrible because its
premise is terrifyingly true that mr walton
was able to give this old theme which applies so
definitely today such emotional appeal places
him in my book as a potential creator of perhaps
a modern classic which i will cherish to my final
day

  i would like to inquire  thus revealing my ig-
norance about an authoress whose stories i
have not seen in a long time could you tell me
if c l moore is still writing short stories it
would be nice if your magazine could get hold
of one for publication

  i have been reading startlm stories since 
though i am not an stf fan and i hope that i
can continue to read it for many a decade to
come- bel won i placc seattle  iv ash

at war with the army

by thomas c pace

  dear editor name your pleasure fooled me
winter thrilling wonder both good adven-
ture and some carefully-pointed moralizing it
should at least make clear to some of your read-
ers that there exists a difference between morals
and ethics

  the entire issue was interesting and extreme-
ly readable i especially liked robert cranes
the female

  those cartoons are a fine idea the one on
page  is about the best stf cartoon i have
ever seen incidentally would it be possible to get
vip cartoons

  i liked a a gillilands view of fans and i
am surprised and pleased that he let me off with
praise and i wifi freely admit that the army
has powerful inducements to persuade one to
change ones ways however the army-or at
least the narrow segments of the infantry and the
signal corps with which i have come in contact
-do a far finer job of temporarily or permanently
embittering people than they do of winning them
over to the service as a career and of course
if their inducements had really sound psychology
behind them this would not be true i wonder
how many potential career ncos the army loses
after their first hitch because they arc fed up
with the stupidity arrogance and pettiness all too
manv ncos and officers exercise

  most of them in spite of the impression given
by the average soldier in conversation are fairly
responsible men doing their best according to
their abilities and backgrounds these are too
often iot good enough to get things done efficiently
or properly and then there is always the omni-
present sheer born natural galloping martinet

  and please dont anyone write and ask me sar-
castically how i explain away the fact that weve
never lost a war i havent any idea and on
reading american history and reflecting on the
fact that the army reputedly hasnt really ever
changed my feelings are about half pride and
half amazement

  id like to ask again for another jack vance
novelet or preferably a series of them and how
about moving marion zimmer rradley out of the
letter column into the contents column the
girl can write she and chad oliver will even-
tually be the outstanding former fans in the pro
ranks-a gateway terrace arbutus mary-
land

  tom had some comments to make on re-
ligion vs science but we feel its time for
new topics to enliven our letter column
and we know youll all be interested to

learn that the sequel to gunns name your
pleasure will be coming up in our next is-
sue an exciting thoughtful novel called
the naked sky

from down-under

by p smith

  dear editor could you give a plug to the
futurian society of sydney australia that is 
we are the second oldest fan club in the world
and have the largest library in the southern
hemisphere members of the club do not have
to pay any library fees-imagine books for
nuttinl we have meetings every monday and
thursday with a monthly film night chess com-
petition cards darts theatre parties and barbe-
cues we also have members

  i suppose i should say that something stinks
about your magazine but- ah yes why all the
criticism of women in your letter column your
readers dont like em or something ive heard
it takes all kinds to make a world but as for me
im all for the ladies

  if there are any fans who want a penfriend
from down-under please feel free to write
until next time cheerio and keep up the good
work-box  gpo sydney australia

  wed sure like to attend one of those
meetings smith but the taxi fare to aus-
tralia is a little steep however now we
know what to do with all the unwanted
women in the states-or wont you accept

chronic non-writer

by ceorge hopkins

  some few meetings back imaginations un-
limited voted to have me express our pleasure
and thanks for your mentioning the club in the
winter issue of fantastic stories the second
paragraph in the argonaut our monthly club
bulletin is expressive of the deep appreciation we
all feel

  i must ask you to excuse the errors in the
bulletin when our duplicator operator cuts the
stencil he floats on pink clouds to the asteroid
belt or starts chasing green men all over dear
old barsoom

  our club is not fannish so we dont try to
dictate to the editors the type of stories they
should publish we leave that to the chronic let-
ter writers who have set themselves up as a self-
appointed board of censors- charlotte kan-
os city  mo

  youre welcome george as for the
self-appointed lioard of censors wed like
to know what other non-writers of letters
have to say are there those among our
readers who resent the fans dominating our
column are there those who feel the
published letters reflect not so much at-
tempts at honest criticism as the desire to
see ones name in print if the silent audi-
ence lias opinions on this subject and we
have a strong hunch they do its time for
them to step from the shadows and speak
up even a chronic non-writer can break
the habit pattern just once huh
well be looking forward to a mail-sack
bulging with letters from heretofore un-
heard-from readers
