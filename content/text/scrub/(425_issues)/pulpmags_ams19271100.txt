 this month represents the scene from the machine man of

 author will be the evolution of man  years hence
 with the aid of his array of tubes this strange being talks
 feeds himself and travels these rays are the only things
 that will penetrate the glass-like substance in which these
 beings live the illustration shows the machine man of the

 hold him suspended in the air for several minutes-making a
 fine substitution for human hands and arms

amazing stories



  many times in the old days
while i trudged home after work
to save carfare i used to gasp
enviouiiy at the shining cars
gliding by me the prosperous
men and women within little
did i think that inside of a year
i too should have my own car
a decent bank account the good
things of life that make it worth
living

i thought success was for others

      believe it or not just twelve months ago
      i was next thing to down-and-out

today im sole owner of the fastest
growing radio store in town and im
on good terms with my banker too-not like
the old days only a year ago when often i
didnt have one dollar to knock against an-
other in my pocket my wife and i live in
the snuggest little home you ever saw right
in one of the best neighborhoods and to
think that a year ago i used to dodge the
landlady when she came to collect the rent
for the little bedroom i called home

  it all seems like a dream now as i look
back over the past twelve short months and
think how discouraged i was then at the
end of a blind alley i thought i never
had had a good chance in my life and i
thought i never would have one but it was
waking up that i needed and heres the story
of how i got it

i was a clerk working at the usual miser-
able salary such jobs pay somehow id
never found any way to get into a line where
i could make good money

  other fellows seemed to find opportunities
but-much as i wanted the good things that
go with success and a decent income-all the
really well-paid vacancies i ever heard of
seemed to be out of my line-to call for some
kind of knowledge i didnt have

  and i wanted to get married a fine situa-
tion wasnt it mary would have agreed to
try it-but it wouldnt have been fair to her

  mary had told me you cant get ahead
where you are why dont you get into an-
other line of work somewhere that you can
advance 

  thats fine mary i replied but what
line ive always got my eyes open for a bet-
ter job but i never seem to hear of a really
good job that i can handle mary didnt
seem to be satisfied with the answer but i
didnt know what else to tell her

  it was on the way home that night that i
stopped off in the neighborhood drug store
where i overheard a scrap of conversation
about myself a few burning words that
were the cause of the turning point in my
life

  with a hot flush of shame i turned and left
the store and walked rapidly home so that
was what my neighbors-the people who
knew me best-really thought of me

  bargain counter sheik-look how that suit
fits one fellow had said in a low voice
bet he hasnt got a dollar in those pockets
oh its just useless anderson said an-
other hes got a wish-bone where his back-
bone ought to be

  as i thought over the words in deep hu-
miliation a sudden thought made me catch
my breath why had mary been so dissatis-
fied with my answer that i hadnt had a
chance did mary secretly think that toof
and after all wasnt it true that i had a
wish-bone where my back-bone ought to
be wasnt that why i never had a chance
to get ahead it was true only too true-
and it had taken this cruel blow to my self-
esteem to make me see it

  with a new determination i thumbed the
pages of a magazine on the table searching
for an advertisement that id seen many
times but passed up without thinking an ad-
vertisement telling of big opportunities for
trained men to succeed in the great new
radio field with the advertisement was a
coupon offering a big free book full of infor-
mation i sent the coupon in and in a few
days received a handsome -page book
printed in two colors telling all about the
opportunities in the radio field and how a
man can prepare quickly and easily at home
to take advantage of these opportunities i
read the book carefully and when i finished
it i made my decision

whats happened in the twelve months
since that day as ive already told you
seems almost like a dream to me now for
ten of those twelve months ive had a radio
business of my own at first of course i
started it asa little proposition on the side
under the guidance of the national radio in-
stitute the outfit that gave me my radio
training it wasnt long before i was getting
so much to do in the radio line that i quit
my measly little clerical job and devoted my
full time to my radio business

  since that time ive gone right on up al-
ways under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute they
would have given me just as much help too
if i had wanted to follow some other line of
radio besides building my own retail busi-
ness-such as broadcasting manufacturing
experimenting sea operating or any one of

the score of lines they prepare you for and
to think that until that day i sent for their
eye-opening book id been wailing i never
had a chance

now im making real money i drive a
good-looking car of my own mary and
i dont own the house in full yet but ive
made a substantial down payment and im
not straining myself any to meet the install-
ments

  heres a real tip you may not be as bad
off as i was but think it over-are you sat-
isfied are you making enough money at
work that you like would you sign a con-
tract to stay where you are now for the next
ten years making the same money if not
youd better be doing something about it in-
stead of drifting

  this new radio game is a live-wire field of
golden rewards the work in any of the 
different lines of radio is fascinating ab-
sorbing well paid the national radio in-
stitute--oldest and largest radio home-study
school in the world-will train you inex-
pensively in your own home to know radio
from a to z and to increase your earnings
in the radio field

  take another tip-no matter what your
plans are no matter how much or how little
you know about radio-clip the coupon be-
low and look their free book over it is filled
with interesting facts figures and photos
and the information it will give you is worth
a few minutes of anybodys time you will
place yourself under no obligation-the book
is free and is gladly sent to anyone who

space flying

by hugo gernsback

ver since time immemorial the human mind
lias taken wings and soared out into free space
among the planets and the stars scientifiction
writers of note have always taken with avidity
to this fascinating subject while some of the
greatest minds have occupied themselves with
the problem of space flying since the advent of the air-
plane many schemes have been proposed to launch a space
flyer by which it would be possible to negotiate the distance
between the earth and the moon and then from the earth
to the various planets many schemes have been proposed
for space flying and some of the more recent ones notably
the goddard rocket flyer seem to conte closest toward a
strictly scientific solution of the problem

  let us now make a general survey of the possibilities of
space flying in the light of present-day science if it becomes
possible to navigate a space flyer outside of the terrestrial
atmosphere even if only to such a comparatively near body
as the moon then immediately an important popular con-
ception becomes a certain impossibility i refer to the pres-
ent inhabitation of reasoning beings on other planets at least
of our own universe

  the reason is simple if we can navigate a space flyer
let us say to mars or venus then it may be assumed that
none of the planets is now peopled by teasoning intelligent
beings

  this theoretical reasoning is elementary simply because
if we do the thing first vve are probably the only reasoning
beings in our own universe otherwise older civilizations
would undoubtedly have visited us first there is a reser-
vation to this in the case of mars and of the moon it is
quite within the bounds of possibility that were mars or
the moon inhabited by highly intelligent beings they might
have tried a landing on earth loir before the earth had
become habitable for other f ligent beings if a landing
had been tried the reconnoirng party in their space flyers
would probably have had to turn back because the shores
of the earth several million years ago were probably unfit
to set foot uoon thus it is quite possible that if intelligent
bcines existed on the moon or mars thev have had tn return
t their own abode where their race finally died out

  if this were the case traces of their civilizamon would
very likely be found by the first space flying prtv tht set
foot  either the moon or mars this reasoning is anal-
ogous to that concernimr the cycle through which the earth
is passinsr now tf for instance we were to try to make
a landing on either jupiter or saturn today we would
find that it was impossible because these planets are still in
a semi-plastic state which of course would make them im-
possible to live  these planets and a number of others
are thus in the same condition as the earth was millions of

  the term spaee-fiyer was first used by the author in his story
ralph c- published in 

years ago and they are slowly cooling and solidifying

  next we come to some other important considerations
there is a chance that mars and indeed other planets
belonging to other parts of our universe may be peopled
with beings of intelligence far higher than our own they
may have space flyers and yet may be prevented from visit-
ing our earth for the following reasons

  it is one thing to construct a practical space flyer which
its many conditions theoretically but it is another thing
altogether to navigate it successfully in space an analogy
to this might be found in the present achieved state of the
airplane it is theoretically possible to fly an airplane across
any of our oceans hut for practical reasons it is a tre-
mendous risk and will remain so for some years in space
flying however we have obstacles that may never be over-
come and which make the attempt so hazardous that it
becomes folly to attempt it

  it is well known today that the space between our heavenly
bodies is not just one great and empty vacuum quite the
contrary it is pretty much alive with meteors and other
small bodies that constantly hurtle through space at tre-
mendous speeds nor are these meteors infrequent it is
known that their distribution is rather dense and it may
be doubted whether a space flyer could be sent from the
earth to the moon without encountering dozens of such
celestial projectiles traveling at speeds of as high as four
miles per second which would annihilate anything with
which they came in contact

  we are fortunate that our earth possesses an atmosphere
because the meteors entering the upper strata of our gaseous
envelope are ignited by th friction and usually are reduced
to dust before they travei very far this meteoric dust
settles upon the earth gradually

  out in free space where there is no atmosphere  such
protection exists the space flyer would probably not know
of his impending fate until one of these bodies was imme-
diately upon him and then it would be too late there is
a chance that srnc instruments might be invented with
which to ascertain the approach of a meteor while it
is still thousands r f miles away thus its course could be
plotted quickly enough by some electrical means perhaps
by using high vacuum tube amplification and so possibly
enable the space flyer to steer away quickly enough if there
are too many as is most likely the case then even with such
protection it would certainly be impossible to dodge all the
meteorites at all times

  furthermore another danger of which we know little
as vet is the newly discovered milliken cosmic ray we
know that these rays abound in open space to a much
greater extent than  earth what these rays are capable
of doing to the space flyer has not yet been ascertained it
may be that the forces of this cosmic ray arc such that it
would prevent a space flyer travelling any distance at all

survives stark-naked vivid little gipsies as active
as monkeys and as full of chatter though a little
wanting in words

  their elders were hidden from the wallowing
hippopotami by the crest of the knoll the human
squatting-place was a trampled area among the dead
brown fronds of royal fern through which the
crosiers of this years growth were unrolling to the
light and warmth the fire was a smouldering heap
of char light grey -and black replenished by the old
women from time to time with brown leaves most
of the men were asleep-they slept sitting with their
foreheads on their knees they had killed that morn-
ing a good quarry enough for all a deer that had
been wounded by hunting dogs so that there had
been no quarrelling among them and some of the
women were still gnawing the bones that lay scat-
tered about others were making a heap of leaves
and sticks to feed brother fire when the darkness
came again that he might grow strong and tall
therewith and guard them against the beasts and
two were piling flints that they brought an armful
at a time from the bend of the river where the chil-
dren were at play

  none of these buff-skinned savages were clothed
but some wore about their hips rude girdles of adder-
skin or crackling undressed hide from which de-
pended little bags not made but torn from the paws
of beasts and carrying the rudely-dressed flints that
were mens chief weapons and tools and one
woman the mate of uya the cunning man wore a
wonderful necklace of perforated fossils-that others
had worn before her beside some of the sleeping
men lav the big antlers of the elk with the tines
to sharp edges and long sticks hacked at

   what do you think conditions on this earth were thou-
 sands upon thousands of years ago in the stone age for
 example there were no electric lights no radio and
 for that matter no stiff collars no shoes and no forks
 not even the wheel had been invented

   the first effective weapon of man namely the stone
 ax-a tremendous invention by the way-was yet to be
 evolved

 a really credible work which in the light of present-

chapter i

ugh-lomi and uya

his story is of a time beyond the mem-
ory of man before the beginning of his-
tory a time when one might have walked
dryshod from france as we call it
now to england and when a broad and
sluggish thames flowed through its marshes to meet
its father rhine flowing through a wide and level
country that is under water in these latter days and
which we know by the name of the north sea in
that remote age the valley which runs along the foot
of the downs did not exist and the south of surrey
was a range of hills fir-clad on the middle slopes
and snow-capped for the better part of the year
the cores of its summits still remain as leith hill
and pitch hill and hindhead on the lower slopes
of the range below the grassy spaces where the wild
horses grazed were forests of yew and sweet-chest-
nut and elm and the thickets and dark places bid the
grizzly bear and the hysena and the grey apes clam-
bered through the branches and still lower amidst
the woodland and marsh and open grass along the
wey did this little drama play itself out to the end
that i have to tell fifty thousand years ago it was
fifty thousand years-if the reckoning of geologists
is correct

  and in those days the spring-time was as joyful
as it is now and sent the blood coursing in just the
same fashion the afternoon sky was blue with
piled white clouds sailing through it and the south-
west wind came like a soft caress the new-come
swallows drove to and fro the reaches of the
river were spangled with white ranunculus the
marshy places were starred with ladys-smock and
lit with marshmallow
wherever the regiments of
the sedges lowered their
swords and the northward
moving hippopotami shiny
black monsters sporting
clumsily came floundering
and blundering through it
all rejoicing dimly and
possessed with one clear
idea to splash the river
muddy

  up the river and well
in sight of the hippopot-
ami a number of the little
buff - coloured animals
dabbed in the water there
was no fear no rivalry
and no enmity between
them and the hippopotami

as the great bulks came
crashing through the reeds and smashed the mirror of
the water into silvery splashes these little crfeatures
shouted and gesticulated with glee it was the sur-
est sign of high spring boloo they cried
baayah boloo they were the children of the
men folk the smoke of whose encampment rose
from the knoll at the rivers bend wild-eyed
youngsters they were with matted hair and little
broad-nosed impish faces covered as some children
are covered even nowadays with a delicate down
of hair they were narrow in the loins and long
in the arms and their ears had no lobes and had

eudena had hidden herself among the alders
because she was afraid of uya she was still
a girl and her eyes were bright and her smile pleas-
ant to see he had given her a piece of the liver a
mans piece and a wonderful treat for a girl to get
but as she took it the other woman with the neck-
lace had looked at her an evil glance and ugh-lomi
had made a noise in his throat at that uya had
looked at him long and steadfastly and ugh-lomis


amazing stories

face had fallen and then uya had looked at her
she was frightened and she had stolen away while
the feeding was still going on and uya was busy
with the marrow of a bone afterwards he had
wandered about as if looking for her and now
she crouched among the alders wondering mightily
what uya might be doing with the flint and the
bone and ugh-lomi was not to be seen

  presently a squirrel came leaping through the
alders and she lay so quiet the little man was within
six feet of her before he saw her whereupon he
dashed up a stem in a hurry and began to chatter
and scold her what are you doing here he
asked away from the other men beasts peace
said eudena but he only chattered more and then
she began to break off the little black cones to throw
at him he dodged and defied her and she grew
excited and rose up to throw better and then she
saw uya coming down the knoll he had seen the
movement of her pale arm amidst the thicket-he
was very keen-eyed

  at that she forgot the squirrel and set off through
the alders and reeds as fast as she could go she
did not care where she went so long as she escaped
uya she splashed nearly knee-deep through a
swampy place and saw in front of her a slope of
ferns-growing more slender and green as they
passed up out of the light into the shade of the
young chestnuts she was soon amidst the trees-
she was very fleet of foot and she ran on and on
until the forest was old and the vales great and the
vines about their stems where the light came were
thick as young trees and the ropes of ivy stout and
tight on she went and she doubled and doubled
again and then at last lay down amidst some ferns
in a hollow place near a thicket and listened with
her heart beating in her ears

  she heard footsteps presently rustling among the
dead leaves far off and they died away and every-
thing was still again except the scandalising of the
midges-for the evening was drawing on-and the
incessant whisper of the leaves she laughed silently
to think the cunning uya should go by her she
was not frightened sometimes playing with the
other girls and lads she had fled into the wood
though never so far as this it was pleasant to be
hidden and alone

  she lay a long time there glad of her escape and
then she sat up listening

  it was a rapid pattering growing louder and com-
ing towards her and in a little while she could hear
grunting noises and the snapping of twigs it was a
drove of lean grisly wild swine she turned about
her for a boar is an ill fellow to pass too closely on
account of the sideway slash of his tusks and she
made off slantingly through the trees but the pat-
ter came nearer they were not feeding as they
wandered but going fast-or else they would not
overtake her-and she caught the limb f a tree
swung on to it and ran up the stem with something
of the agility of a monkey

  down below the sharp bristling backs of the swiae
were already passing when she looked and she
knew the short sharp grunts they made meant fear
what were they afraid of a man they were
in a great hurry for just a man

  and then so suddenly it made her grip on the
branch tighten involuntarily a fawn started in the
brake and rushed after the swine something else

went by low and grey with a long body she did
not know what it was indeed she saw it only mo-
mentarily through the interstices of the young
leaves and then there came a pause

  she remained stiff and expectant as rigid almost
as though she was a part of the tree she clung to
peering down

  then far away among the trees clear for a mo-
ment then hidden then visible knee-deep in ferns
then gone again ran a man she knew it was young
ugh-lomi by the fair colour of his hair and there
was red upon his face somehow his frantic flight
and that scarlet mark made her feel sick and then
nearer running heavily and breathing hard came
another man at first she could not see and then
she saw foreshortened and clear to her uya run-
ning with great strides and his eyes staring he
was not going after ugh-lomi his face was white
it was uya-afraid he passed and was still within
hearing when something else something large and
with grizzled fur swinging along with soft swift
strides came rushing in pursuit of him

eudena suddenly became rigid ceased to
breathe her clutch convulsive and her eyes
starting

  she had never seen the thing before she did not
even see him clearly now but she knew at once it was
the terror of the woodshade his name was a
legend the children would frighten one another
frighten even themselves with his name and run
screaming to the squatting-place no man had ever
killed any of his kind even the mighty mammoth
feared his anger it was the grizzly bear the lord
of the world as the world went then

  as he ran he made a continuous growling grum-
ble men in my very lair fighting and blood
at the very mouth of my lair men men men
fighting and blood for he was the lord of the
wood and of the caves

  long after he had passed she remained a girl of
stone staring down through the branches all her
power of action had gone from her she gripped
by instinct with hands and knees and feet it was
some time before she could think and then only
one thing was clear in her mind that the terror
was between her and the tribe-that it would be
impossible to descend

  presently when her fear was a little abated she
clambered into a more comfortable position where
a great branch forked the trees rose about her so
that she could see nothing of brother fire who is
black by day birds began to stir and things that
had gone into hiding for fear of her movements
crept out   

  after a time the taller branches flamed out at the
touch of the sunset high overhead the rooks who
were wiser than men went cawing home to their
squatting-places among the elms looking down
things were clearer and darker eudena thought of
going back to the squatting-place she let herself
down some way and then the fear of the terror of
the woodshade came again while she hesitated a
rabbit squealed dismally and she dared not descend
farther

  the shadows gathered and the deeps of the forest
began stirring eudena went up the tree again to
be nearer the light down below the shadows came
out of their hiding-places and walked abroad over-
a story of the stone age



head the blue deepened a dreadful stillness came
and then the leaves began whispering

  eudena shivered and thought of brother fire

  the shadows now were gathering in the trees
they sat on the branches and watched her branches
and leaves were turned to ominous quiet black
shapes that would spring on her if she stirred then
the white owl flitting silently came ghostly through
the shades darker grew the world and darker
until the leaves and twigs against the sky were black
and the ground was hidden

  she remained there all night an age-long vigil
straining her ears for the things that went on below
in the darkness and keeping motionless lest some
stealthy beast should discover her man in those
days was never alone in the dark save for such rare
accidents as this age after age he had learnt the
lesson of its terror-a lesson we poor children of
his have nowadays painfully to unlearn eudena
though in age a woman was in heart like a little
child she kept as still poor little animal as a hare
before it is started

  the stars gathered ahd watched her-her one
grain of comfort in one bright one she fancied
there was something like ugh-lomi then she fan-
cied it was ugh-lomi and near him red and duller
was uya and as the night passed ugh-lomi fled
before him up the sky

  she tried to see brother fire who guarded the
squatting-place from beasts but he was not in sight
and far away she heard the mammoths trumpeting
as they went down to the drinking-place and once
some huge bulk with heavy paces hurried along
making a noise like a calf but what it was she could
not see but she thought from the voice it was yaaa
the rhinoceros who stabs with his nose goes always
alone and rages without cause

  at last the little stars began to hide and then the
larger ones it was like all the animals vanishing
before the terror the sun was coming lord of
the sky as the grizzly was lord of the forest eudena
wondered what would happen if one star stayed
behind and then the skv paled to the dawn

  when the daylight came the fear of lurking things
passed and she could descend she was stiff but
not so stiff as you would have been dear young
lady by virtue of your upbringing and as she had
not been trained to eat at least once in three hours
but instead had often fasted three days she did not
feel uncomfortably hungry she crept down the
tree very cautiously and went her way stealthily
through the wood and not a squirrel sprang or deer
started but the terror of the grizzly bear froze her
marrow

  her desire was now to find her people again her
dread of uya the cunning was consumed by a greater
dread of loneliness but she had lost her direction
she had run heedlessly overnight and she could not
tell whether the squatting-place was sunward or
where it lay ever and again she stopped and lis-
tened and at last very far awav she heard a meas-
ured chinking it was so faint even in the morning
stillness that she could tell it must be far away
but she knew the sound was that of a man sharpen-
ing a flint

  presently the trees began to thin out and then
came a regiment of nettles barring the way she
turned aside and then she came to a fallen tree
that she knew with a noise of bees about it and

so presently she was in sight of the knoll very far
off and the rivei under il and the children and
the hippopotami just as they had been yesterday
and the thin spire of smoke swaying in the morning
breeze far away by the river was the cluster of
alders where she had hidden and at the sight of
that the fear of uya returned and she crept into a
thicket of bracken out of which a rabbit scuttled
and lay awhile to watch the squatting-place

the men were mostly out of sight saving wau
the flint-chopper and at that she felt safer
they were awafv hunting food no doubt some of
the women too were down in the stream stooping
intent seeking mussels crayfish and water-snails
and at the sight of their occupation eudena felt
hungry she rose and ran through the fern design-
ing to join them as she went she heard a voice
among the bracken calling softly she stopped
then suddenly she heard a rustle behind her and
turning saw ugh-lomi rising out of the fern there
were streaks of brown blood and dirt on his face
and his eyes were fierce and the white stone of
uva the white fire stone that none but uya dared
to touch was in his hand in a stride he was beside
her and gripped her arm he swung her about
and thrust her before him towards the woods
uva he said and waved his arms about she
heard a cry looked back and saw all the women
standing up and two wading out of the stream
then came a nearer howling and the old woman
with the beard who watched the fire on the knoll
was waving her arms and wau the man who had
been chipping the flint was getting to his feet the
little children too were hurrying and shouting

  come said ugh-lomi and dragged her by the
arm

  she still did not understand

  uya has called the death word said ugh-lomi
and she glanced back at the screaming curve of fig-
ures and understood

  wau and all the women and children were coming
towards them a scattered array of buff shock-headed
figures howling leaping and crying over the
knoll two youths hurried down among the ferns
to the right came a man heading them off from the
wood ugh-lomi dropped her arm and the two began
running side by side leaping the bracken and step-
ping clear and wide eudena knowing her fleetness
and the fleetness of ugh-lomi laughed aloud at the
unequal chase they were an exceptionally straight-
limbed couple for those days

  they soon cleared the open and drew near the
wood of chestnut-trees again-neither afraid now
because neither was alone they slackened their
pace already not excessive and suddenly eudena
cried and swerved aside pointing and looking up
through the tree-stems ugh-lomi saw the feet and
legs of men running towards him eudena was
already running off at a tangent and as he too
turned to follow her they heard the voice of uya
coming through the trees and roaring out his rage
at them

  then terror came in their hearts not the terror
that numbs but the terror that makes one silent and
swift they were cut off now on two sides they
were in a sort of corner of pursuit on the right
hand and near them came the men swift and heavy
with bearded uya antler in hand leading them and


amazing stories

on the left scattered as one scatters corn yellow
dashes among the fern and grass ran wau and the
women and even the little children from the shallow
had joined the chase the two parties converged
upon them off they went with eudena ahead

  they knew there was no mercy for them there
was no hunting so sweet to these ancient men as the
hunting of men once the fierce passion of the
chase was lit the feeble beginnings of humanity in
them were thrown to the winds and uya in the
night had marked ugh-lomi with the death word
ugh-lomi was the days quarry the appointed feast

  they ran straight-it was their oqly chance-tak-
ing whatever ground came in the way-a spread of
stinging nettles an open glade a clump of grass out
of which a hyaena fled snarling then woods again
long stretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under
the green trunks then a stiff slope tree-clad and
long vistas of trees a glade a succulent green area
of black mud a wide open space again and then a
clump of lacerating brambles with beast tracks
through it behind them the chase trailed out and
scattered with uya ever at their heels eudena kept
the first place running light and with her breath
easy for ugh-lomi carried the fire stone in his
hand 

   it told on his pace-not at first but after a time
his footsteps behind her suddenly grew remote
glancing over her shoulder as they crossed another
open space eudena saw that ugh-lomi was many
yards behind her and uya close upon him with
antler already raised in the air to strike him down
wau and the others were but just emerging from
the shadow of the woods

  seeing ugh-lomi in peril eudena ran sideways
looking back threw up her arms and cried aloud
just as the antler flew and young ugh-lomi ex-
pecting this and understanding her cry ducked his
head so that the missile merely struck his scalp
lightly making but a trivial wound and flew over
him he turned forthwith the quartzite fire stone
in both hands and hurled it straight at uyas body
as he ran loose from the throw uya shouted but
could not dodge it it took him under the ribs
heavy and flat and be reeled and went down without
a cry ugh-lomi caught up the antler-one tine of
st was tipped with his own blood-and came running
on again with a red trickle just coming out of his
hair

  uya rolled over twice and la a moment before
he got up and then he did not run fast the colour
of his face was changed wau overtook him and
then others and he coughed and laboured in his
breath but he kept on

at last the two fugitives gained the bank of the
l river where the stream ran deep and narrow
and they still had fifty yards in hand of wau the
foremost pursuer the man who made thg smiting
stones he carried one a large flint the shape of an
oyster and double the size chipped to a chisel edge
in either hand

   they sprang down the steep bank into the stream
rushed through the water swam the deep current
in two or three strokes and came out wading again
dripping and refreshed to clamber up the farther
bank it was undermined and with willows grow-
ing thickly therefrom so that it needed clambering
and while eudena was still among the silvery

branches and ugh-lomi still in the water-for the
antler had encumbered him-wau came up against
the sky on the opposite bank and the smiting stone
thrown cunningly took the side of eudenas knee
she struggled to the top and fell

   they heard the pursuers shout to one another
 and ugh-lomi climbing to her and moving jerkily
 to mar waus aim felt the second smiting stone
 graze his ear and heard the water splash below him

   then it was ugh-lomi the stripling proved him-
 self to have come to mans estate for running on
 he found eudena fell behind limping and at that
 he turned and crying savagely and with a face ter-
 rible with sudden wrath and trickling blood ran
 swiftly past her back to the bank whirling the antler
 round his head and eudena kept on running
 stoutly still though she must needs limp at every
 step and the pain was already sharp

 	so that wau rising over the edge and clutching
 the straight willow branches saw ugh-lomi tower-
 ing over him gigantic against the blue saw his
 whole body swing round and the grip of his hands
 upon the antler the edge of the antler came sweep-
 ing through the air and he-saw no more the water
 under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crim-
 son six feet down the stream uya following stopped
 knee-high across the stream and the man who was
 swimming turned about

   the other men who trailed after-they were none
 of them very mighty men for uya was more cun-
 ning than strong brooking no sturdy rivals-slack-
 ened momentarily at the sight of ugh-lomi standing
 there above the willows bloody and terrible between
 them and the halting girl with the huge antler wav-
 ing in his hand it seemed as though he had gone
 into the water a youth and come out of it a man full
 grown

  he knew what there was behind him a broad
 stretch of grass and then a thicket and in that
 eudena could hide that was clear in his mind
 though bis thinking powers were too feeble to see
 what should happen thereafter uya stood knee-
 deep undecided and unarmed his heavy mouth
 hung open showing his canine teeth and he panted
 heavily his side was flushed and bruised under the
 hair the other man beside him carried a sharpened
 stick the rest of the hunters came up one by one
 to the top of the bank hairy long-armed men clutch-
 ing flints and sticks two ran off along the bank
 down stream and then clambered to the water where
 vvau had come to the surface struggling weakly
 before they could reach him he went under again
 two others threatened ugh-lomi from the bank

   he answered back shouts vague insults gestures
 then uya who had been hesitating roared with
 rage and whirling his fists plunged into the water
 his followers splashed after him

   ugh-lomi glanced over his shoulder and found
 eudena already vanished into the thicket he would
 perhaps have waited for uya but uya preferred to
 spar in the water below him until the others were
 beside him human tactics in those days in all seri-
 ous fighting were the tactics of the pack prey that
 turned at bay they gathered around and rushed
 ugh-lomi felt the rush coming and hurling the antler
 at uya turned about and fled

   when he halted to look hack from the shadow of
 the thicket he found only three of his pursuers had
 followed him across the river and they were going
a story of the stone age



 back again uya with a bleeding mouth was on
 the farther side of the stream again but lower down
 and holding his hand to his side the others were
 in the river dragging something to shore for a
 time at least the chase was intermitted

    ugh-lomi stood watching for a space and snarled
 at the sight of uya then he turned and plunged
 into the thicket

   in a minute eudena came hastening to join him
 and they went on hand in hand he dimly per-
 ceived the pain she suffered from the cut and bruised
 knee and chose the easier ways but they went on
 all that day mile after mile through wood and
 thicket until at last they came to the chalk land
 open grass with rare woods of beech and the birch
 growing near water and they saw the wealden
 mountains nearer and groups of horses grazing to-
 gether they went circumspectly keepingalways
 near thicket and cover for this was a strange region
 -even its ways were strange steadily the ground
 rose until the chestnut forests spread wide and blue
 below them and the thames marshes shone silvery
 high and far they saw no men for in those days
 men were still only just come into this part of the
 world and were moving but slowly along the river-
 ways towards evening they came on the river again
 but now it ran in a gorge between high cliffs of
 white chalk thdt sometimes overhung it down the
 cliffs was a scrub of birches and there were jnanv-
 birds there and high up the cliff was a little shelf
 by a tree whereon they clambered to pass the night

 they had had scarcely any food it was not
 the time of year for berries and they had 
 time to go aside to snare or waylay they tramped
 in a hungry weary silence gnawing at twigs and
 leaves but over the surface of the cliffs were a
 multitude of snails and in a bush were the freshly
 laid eggs of a little bird and then ugh-lomi threw
 at and killed a squirrel in a beech-tree so that at
 last they fed well ugh-lomi watched during the
 night his chin on his knees and he heard young
 foxes crying hard by and the noise of mammoths
 down the gorge and the hyaenas yelling and laughing-
 far away it was chilly but they dared not light a
 fire whenever jie dozed his spirit went abroad
 and straightway met with the spirit of uya and
 they fought and always ugh-lomi was paralysed
 so that he could not smite nor run and then he would
 awake suddenly eudena too dreamt evil things
 of uya so that they both awoke with the fear of
 him in their hearts and by the light of the dawn
 they saw a woolly rhinoceros go blundering down
 the valley

   during the day they caressed one another and
 were glad of the sunshine and eudenas leg was so
 stiff she sat on the ledge all day ugh-lomi found

	great flints sticking out of the cliff face greater
 than any he had seen and he dragged some tp the
 ledge and began chipping so as to be armed against
 uya when he came again and at one he laughed
 heartily and eudena laughed and they threw it
 about in derision it had a hole in it they stuck
 their fingers through it it was very funny indeed
 then they peeped at one another through it after-
 wards ugh-lomi got himself a stick and thrusting
 by chance at this foolish flint the stick went in and
 stuck there he had rammed it in too tightly to
 withdraw it that was still stranger-scarcely

funny terrible almost and for a th-ne ugh-lomi did
not greatly care to touch the thing it was as if
the flint had bit and held with its teeth but then
he got familiar with the odd combination he swung
it about and perceived that the stick with the heavy
stone on the end struck a better blow than anything
he knew he went to and fro swinging it and strik-
ing with it but later he tired of it and threw it
aside in the afternoon he went up over the brow
of the white cliff and lay watching by a rabbit-
warren until the rabbits came out to play there
were no men thereabouts and the rabbits were heed-
less he threw a smiting stone he had made and
got a kill

  that night they made a fire from flint sparks and
bracken fronds and talked and caressed by it and
in their sleep uyas spirit came again and suddenly
while ugh-lomi was trying to fight vainly the fool-
ish flint  the stick came into his hand and he
struck uya with it and behold it killed him but
afterwards came other dreams of uva--for spirits
take a lot of killing and he had to lie killed again
then after that the stone would not keep on the
stick he awoke tired and rather gloomy and was
sulky all the forenoon in spite of eudenas kind-
liness and instead of hunting he sat chipping a
sharp edge to the singular flint and looking strangely
at her then he bound the perforated flint on to
the stick with strips of rabbit skin and afterwards
he walked up and down the ledge striking with it
and muttering to himself and thinking of uya it
felt very fine and heavy in the hand

  several days more than there was any counting
in those days five days it may be or six did ugh-
lomi and eudena stay on that shelf in the gorge of
the river and they lost all fear of men and their
fire burnt redly of a night and they were very
merry together there was food every day sweet
water and no enemies eudenas knee was well in
a couple of days for those ancient savages had
quick-healing flesh indeed they were very happy

  on one of those days ugh-lomi dropped a chunk
of flint over the cliff he saw it fall and go bound-
ing across the river bank into the river and after
laughing and thinking it over a little he tried another
this smashed a bush of hazel in the most interest-
ing way they spent all the morning dropping stones
from the ledge and in the afternoon they discovered
this new and interesting pastime was also possible
from the cliff brow the next day they had for-
gotten this delight or at least it seemed they had
forgotten

but uya came in dreams to spoil the paradise
three nights he came fighting ugh-lomi in
the morning after these dreams ugh-lomi would
walk up and down threatening him and swinging
the axe and at last came the night after ugh-lomi
brained the otter and they had feasted uya went
too far ugh-lomi awoke scowling under his heavy
brows and he took his axe and extending his hand
towards eudena he bade her wait for him upon the
ledge then he clambered down the white declivity
glanced up once from the foot of it and flourished
his axe and without looking back again went strid-
ing along the river bank until the overhanging cliff
at the bend hid him

  two days and nights did eudena sit alone by the
fire on the ledge waiting and in the night the beasts
 

amazing stories

howled over the cliffs and down the valley and on
the cliff over against her the hunched hyaenas prowled
black against the sky but no evil thing came near
her save fear once far away she heard the roar-
ing of a lion following the horses as they came
northward over the grass lands with the spring all
that time she waited-the waiting that is pain

  and the third day ugh-lomi came back up the
river the plumes of a raven were in his hair the
first axe was red-stained and had long dark hairs
upon it and he carried the necklace that had marked
the favourite of uya in his hand lie walked in the
soft places giving  heed to his trail save a raw
cut below his jaw there was not a wound upon him
uya cried ugh-lomi exultant and eudena saw
it was well he put the necklace  eudena and
they ate and drank together and after eating he
began to rehearse the whole story from the begin-
ning when uya had cast his eyes on eudena and
uya and ugh-lomi fighting in the forest had been
chased by the bear eking out his scanty words with
abundant pantomime springing to his feet and whirl-
ing the stone axe round when it came to the lighting
the last fight was a mighty one stamping and hout-
ing and once a blow at the fire that sent a torrent
of sparks mip into the night and eudena sat red
in the light of the fire gloating on him her face
flushed and her eves shining and the necklace uya
had made about her neck it was a splendid time
and the stars that looked down on us looked down
on her our ancestor-who has been dead now these
fifty thousand years

chapter ii

the cave bear

in the days when eudena and ugh-lomi fled
from the people of uya towards the fir-clad
mountains of the weald across the forests of
sweet chestnut and the grass-clad chalk land and hid
themselves at last in the gorge of the river between
the chalk cliffs men were few and their squatting-
places far between the nearest men to them were
those of the tribe a full days journey down the
river ancl up the mountains there were none man
was indeed a newcomer to this part of the world in
that ancient time coming slowly along the rivers
generation after generation from one squatting-place
to another from the south-westward and the ani-
mals that held the land the hippopotamus and rhi-
noceros of the river valleys the horses of the grass
plains the deer and swine of the woods the grey
apes in the branches the cattle of the uplands feared
him but little-let alone the mammoths in the moun-
tains and the elephants that came through the land
in the summer-time out of the south for why
should they fear him with but the rough chipped
flints that he had not learnt to haft and which he
threw but ill and the poor spear of sharpened wood
as all the weapons he had against hoof and horn
tooth and claw 

  andoo the huge cave bear wlio lived in the cave
up the gorge had never even seen a man in ali bis
wise and respectable life until midway through one
night as he was prowling down the gorge along the
cliff edge he saw the glare of eudenas fire upon
the ledge and eudena red and shining and ugh-
lomi with a gigantic shadow mocking him upon the

white cliff going to and fro shaking his mane of
hair and waving the axe of stone-the first axe of
stone-while he chanted of the killing of uya the
cave bear was far up the gorge and he saw the
thing slanting-ways and far off he was so sur-
prised he stood quite still upon the edge sniffing
the novel odour of burning bracken and wondering
whether the dawn wascoming up in the wrong place

  he was the lord of the rocks and caves was the
cave bear as his slighter brother the grizzly was
lord of the thick woods below and as the dappled
lion-the lion of those days was dappled-was lord
of the thorn-thickets reedbeds and open plains

 le was the greatest of all meat-eaters he knew no
fear none preyed on him and none gave him battle
only the rhinoceros was beyond his strength even
the mammoth shunned his country this invasion
perplexed him he noticed these new beasts were
shaped like monkeys and sparsely hairy like voung
pigs monkey and young pig said the cave bear
it might not be so bad but that red thing that
jumps and the black thing jumping with it yonder
never in my life have  seen such things before

  he came slowly along the brow of the cliff
towards them stopping thrice to sniff and peer and
the reek of the fire grew stronger a couple of
hyaenas also were so intent upon the thing below
that andoo coming soft and easy was close upon
them before they knew of him or he of them they
started guiltily and went lurching off coming
round in a wheel a hundred yards off they began
yelling and calling him names to revenge themselves
for the start they had had ya-ha they cried
who cant grub his own burrows who eats roots
like a pig    ya-ha for even in those days the
hyaenas manners were just as offensive as they are
now

  who answers the hyaena  growled andoo peer-
ing through the midnight dimness at them and then
going-to look at the cliff edge

  there was ugh-lomi still telling his story and
the fire getting low and the scent of the burning
hot and strong

  andoo stood  the edge of the chalk cliff for
some time shifting his vast weight from foot to
foot and swaying his head to and fro with his mouth
open his ears erect and twitching and the nostrils
of his big black muzzle sniffing he was very curi-
ous was the cave bear more curious than any of
the bears that live now and the flickering fire and
the incomprehensible movements of the man let alone
the intrusion into his indisputable province stirred
him with a sense of strange new happenings he
had been after red deer fawn that night fo the
cave bear was a miscellaneous hunter but this quite
turned him from that enterprise

  ya-ha yelled the hyaenas behind ya-ha-ha

  peering through the starlight andoo saw there
were now three or four going to and fro against the
grev hillside thev will hang about me now all
the night    until t kill said andoo filth of
the world  and mainly to annov their he resolved
to watch the red flicker in the gorge until the dawn
came to drive the hyaena smim home and after
a time they vanished and he heard their voices like
 party of cockney beanfeasters away in the befech-
woods then they came slinking near again andoo
yawned and went on along the cliff and they fol-
lowed then he stopped and went back
a story of the stone age



  it was a splendid night beset with shining con-
stellations the same stars but not the same constel-
lations we know for since those days all the stars
have had time to move into new places far away
across the open space beyond where the heavy-
shouldered lean-bodied hyaenas blundered and
howled was a beech-wood and the mountain slopes
rose beyond a dim rftystery until their snow-capped
summits came out white and cold and clear touched
by the first rays of the yet unseen moon it was a
vast silence save when the yell of the hyaenas flung
a vanishing discordance across its peace or when
from dowm the hills the trumpeting of the new-come
elephants came faintly on the faint breeze and
below now the red flicker had dwindled and was
steady and shone a deeper red and ugh-lomi had
finished his story and was preparing to sleep and
eudena sat and listened to the strange voices of
unknown beasts and watched the dark eastern sky
growing deeply luminous at the advent of the moon
down below the river talked to itself and things
unseen went to and fro

  after a time the bear went away but in an hour
he was back again then as if struck by a thought
he turned and went up the gorge   

the night passed and ugh-lomi slept on the
waning moon rose and lit the gaunt white cliff
overhead with a light that was pale and vague the
gorge remained in a deeper shadow and seemed all
the darker then bv imperceptible degrees the day
came stealing in the wake of the moonlight eude-
nas eyes wandered to the cliff brow overhead once
and then again each time the line was sharp and
clear against the sky and yet she had a dim percep-
tion of something lurking there the red of the
fire grew deeper and deeper grey scales spread upon
it its vertical column of smoke became more and
more visible and up and down the gorge things that
had been unseen grew clear in a colourless illumina-
tion she may have dozed

  suddenly she started up from her squatting posi-
tion erect and alert scrutinising the cliff up and
down

  she made the faintest sound and ugh-lomi too
light-sleeping like an animal was instantly awake
he caught up his axe and came noiselessly to her
side

  the light was still dim the world now all in black
and dark grey and one sickly star still lingered over-
head the ledge they were on was a little grassy
space six feet wide perhaps and twenty feet long
sloping outwardly and with a handful of st johns
wort growing near the edge below it the soft white
rock fell away in a steep slope of nearly fiftv feet
to the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river
down the river this slope increased until some wav
off a thin grass held its own right up to the crest of
the cliff overhead forty or fifty feet of rock
bulged into the great masses characteristic of chalk
but at the end of the ledge a gully a precipitous
groove of discoloured rock slashed the face of the
cliff and gave a footing to a scrubby growth by
which eudena and ugh-lomi went up and down

  they stood as noiseless as startled deer with even
sense expectant for a minute they heard nothing
and then came a faint rattling of dust down the gullv
and the creaking of twigs

  ugh-lomi gripped his axe and went to the brow

of the ledge for the bulge of the chalk overhead
had hidden the upper part of the gully and forth
with with a sudden contraction of the heart he saw
the cave bear half-way down from the brow and
making a gingerly backward step with his flat hind-
toot his hind-quarters were towards ugh-lomi
and he clawed at the rocks and bushes so that he
seemed flattened against the-cliff he looked none
the less for that from his shining snout to his
stumpy tail he was a lion and a half the length of
two tall men he looked over his shoulder and
his huge mouth was open with the exertion of hold-
ing up his great carcass and his tongue lay out   

  he got his footing and came down slowly a yard
nearer

  bear said ugh-lomi looking round with his
face white

  but eudena with terror in her eyes was pointing
down the cliff

  ugh-lomis mouth fell open for down below
with her big fore-feet against the rock stood another
big brown-grey bulk-the she-bear she was not
so big as andoo but she was big enough for all that

  then suddenly ugh-lomi gave a cry and catching
up a handful of the litter of ferns that lay scattered
on the ledge he thrust it into the pallid ash of the
fire brother fire  he cried brother fire  and
eudena starting into activity did likewise brother
fire help help brother fire

  brother fire was still red in his heart but he
turned to grey as they scattered him brother
fire they screamed but he whispered and passed
and there was nothing but ashes then ugh-lomi
danced with anger and struck the ashes with his fist
but eudena began to hammer the firestone against
a flint and the eyes of each were turning ever and
again towards the gully by which andoo was climb-
ing down brother fire

suddenly the huge furry hind-quarters of the
bear came iito view beneath the bulge of the
chalk that had hidden him he was still clambering
gingerly down the nearly vertical surface his head
was yet out of sight but they could hear him talk-
ing to himself pig and monkey said the cave
bear it ought to be good

  eudena struck a spark and blew at it it twinkled
brighter and then-went out at tltat she cast down
flint and firestone and stared blankly then she
sprang to ner feet and scrambled a yard or so up
the clift above the ledge how she hung on even
for a moment i do not know for the chalk was
vertical and without grip for a monkey in a couple
of seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with
bleeding hands

  ugh-lomi was making frantic rushes about the
ledge-now he would go to the edge now to the
gully he did not know what to do he could not
think the she-bear looked smaller than her mate-
much if they rushed clown on her together one
might live ugh said the cave bear and ugh-
lomi turned again and saw his little eyes peering
under the bulge of the chalk

  eudena cowering at the end of the ledge began
to scream like a gripped rabbit

  at that a sort of madness came upon ugh-lomi
with a mighty cry he caught up his axe and ran
towards andoo the monster gave a grunt of sur-
prise in a moment ugh-lomi was clinging to a


amazing stories

bush rig underneath the bear and in another he
was hangup to its back half buried in fur with one
fist clutched in the hair under its jaw the bear
was too astonished at this fantastic attack to do more
than cling passive and then the axe the first of
all axes rang on its skull

  the bears head twisted from side to side and
he began a petulant scolding growl the axe bit
within an inch of the left eye and the hot blood
blinded that side at that the brute roared with
surpie and anger and his teeth gnashed six inches
from ugh-lomis face then the axe clubbed close
came down heavily on the corner of the jaw

  the next blow blinded the right side and called
forth a roar this time of pain eudena saw the
huge fiat feet slipping and sliding and suddenly the
bear gave a clumsy leap sideways as if for the
ledge then everything vanished and the hazels
smashed and a roar of painjmd a tumult of shouts
and growls came up from far below

  eudena screamed and ran to the edge and peered
over for a moment man and bears were a heap
together ugh-lomi uppermost and then he had
sprung clear and was scaling the gully again with
the bears rolling and striking at one another among
the hazels but he had left his axe below and three
knob-ended- streaks of carmine were shooting down
his thigh up he cried and in a moment eu-
dena was leading the way to the top of the cliff

  in half a minute they were at the crest their hearts
pumping noisily with andoo and his wife far and
safe below them andoo was sitting on his haunches
both paws at work trying with quick exasperated
movements to wipe the blindness out of his eyes
and the she-bear stood  all-fours a little way off
ruffled in appearance and growling angrily ugh-
lomi flung himself flat on the grass and lay panting
and bleeding with his face on his arms

  for a second eudena regarded the bears then she
came and sat beside him looking at him   

  presently she put forth her hand timidly and
touched him and made the guttural sound that was
his name he turned over and raised himself on
his arm his face was pale like the face of one
who is afraid he looked at her steadfastly for a
moment and then suddenly he laughed waugh
he said exultantly

  waugh said she-a simple but expressive con-
versation

  then i gh-lomi came and knelt beside her and
on hands and knees peered over the brow and exam-
ined the gorge his breath was steady now and the
blood on his leg had ceased to flow though the
scratches the she-bear had made were open and wide
he squatted up and sat staring at the footmarks of
the great bear as they came to the gully-they were
as wide as his head and twice as long then he
jumped up and went along the cliff face until the
ledge was visible here he sat down for some time
thinking while eudena watched him presently she
saw the bears had gone

  at last ugh-lomi rose as one whose mind is made
up he returned towards the gully eudena keeping
close by him and together they clambered to the
ledge they took the firestone and a flint and then
ugh-lomi went down to the foot of the cliff very
cautiously and found his axe they returned to
the cliff as quietly as they could and set off at a
brisk walk the ledge was a home no longer with

such callers in the neighbourhood ugh-lomi car-
ried the axe and eudena the firestone so simple
was a palaeolithic removal

they went up-stream although it might lead
to the very lair of the cave bear because there
was no other way to go down the stream was the
tribe and had not ugh-lomi hilled uya and wau
by the stream they had to keep-because of drinking

  so they marched through beech trees with the
gorge deepening until the river flowed a frothing
rapid five hundred feet below them of all the
changeful things in this world of change the courses
of rivers in deep valleys change least it was the
river wey the river we know to-day and they
marched over the very spots where nowadays stand
little guildford and godalming - the first human
beings to come into the land once a grey ape chat-
tered and vanished and all along the cliff edge vast
and even ran the spoor of the great cave bear 

  and then the spoor of the bear fell away from the
cliff showing ugh-lomi thought that he came from
some place to the left and keeping to the cliffs edge
they presently came to an end they found them-
selves looking down on a great semi-circular space
caused by  the collapse of the cliff it had smashed
right across the gorge banking the up-stream water
back in a pool which overflowed in a rapid the
slip had happened long ago it was grassed over
but the face of the cliffs that stood about the semi-
circle was still almost fresh-looking and white as
on the day when the rock must have broken and slid
down starkly exposed and black under the foot
of these cliffs were the mouths of several caves and
as they stood there looking at the space and disin-
clined to skirt it because they thought the bears
lair lay somewhere on the left in the direction they
must needs take they saw suddenly first one bear
and then two coming up the grass slope to the right
and going across the amphitheatre towards the caves
andoo was first he dropped a little on his fore-foot
and his mien was despondent and the she-bear came
shuffling behind

  eudena and ugh-lomi stepped back from the cliff
until they could just see the bears over the verge
then ugh-lomi stopped eudena pulled his arm
but he turned with a forbidding gesture and her
hand dropped ugh-lomi stood watching the bears
with his axe in his hand until they had vanished into
the cave he growled softly and shook the axe at
the she-bears receding quarters then to eudenas
terror instead of creeping off with her he lay flat
down and crawled forward into such a position that
he could just see the cave it was bears-and he
did it as calmly as if it had been rabbits he was
watching

  he lay still like a barked log sttn-dappled in
the shadow of the trees he was thinking and
eudena had learnt even when a little girl that when
ugh-lomi became still like that jawbone on fist
novel things presently began to happen

  it was an hour before the thinking was over it
was noon when the two little savages had found
their way to the cliff brow that overhung the bears
cave and all the long afternoon they fought des-
perately with a great boulder of chalk trundling it
with nothing but their unaided sturdy muscles from
the gully where it had hung like a loose tooth
towards the cliff top it was full two yards about
a story of the stone age



it stood as high as eudenas waist it was obtuse-
angled and toothed with flints and when the sun
set it was poised three inches from the edge above
the cave of the great cave bear

  in the cave conversation languished during that
afternoon the she-bear snoozed sulkily in her cor-
ner-for she was fond of pig and monkey-and
andoo was busy licking the side of his paw and
smearing his face to cool the smart and inflamma-
tion of his wounds afterwards he went and sat
just within the mouth of the cave blinking out at
the afternoon sun with his uninjured eye and
thinking

  i never was so startled in my life he said at
last they are the most extraordinary beasts at-
tacking met

  i dont like them said the she-bear out of the
darkness behind

  a feebler sort of beast i never saw i cant
think what the world is coming to scraggy weedy
legs    wonder how they keep warm in winter
very likely they dont said the she-bear

  i suppose its a sort of monkey gone wrong
  its a change said the she-bear	

  a pause

  the advantage he had was merely accidental
said andoo these things will happen at times

  i cant understand why you let go said the she-
bear

that matter had been discussed before and
settled so andoo being a bear of experience
remained silent for a space then he resumed upon
a different aspect of the matter he has a sort of
claw-a long claw that he seemed to have first on
one paw and then on the other just one claw
theyre very odd things the bright thing too they
seemed to have-like that glare that comes in the
sky in daytime-only it jumps about-its really
worth seeing its a thing with a root too-like grass
when it is windy

  does it bite asked the she-bear if it bites
it cant be a plant

  no-i dont know said andoo but its
curious anyhow

  i wonder if they are good eating said the she-
bear

  they look it said andoo with appetite-for
the cave bear like the polar bear was an incurable
carnivore-no roots or honey for him

  the two bears fell into a meditation for a space
then andoo resumed his simple attentions to his
eye the sunlight up the green slope before the
cave mouth grew warmer in tone and warmer until
it was a ruddy amber

  curious sort of thing-day said the cave bear
lot too much of it i think quite unsuitable for
hunting dazzles me always t cant smell nearly
so well by day

  the she-bear did not answer but there came a
measured crunching sound out of the darkness she
had turned up a bone andoo yawned well he
said he strolled to the cave mouth and stood with
his head projecting surveying the amphitheatre he
found he had to turn his head completely round to
see objects on his right-hand side no doubt that
eye would be all right to-morrow

  he yawned again there was a tap overhead
and a big mass of chalk flew out from the cliff face

  dropped a yard in front of his nose and starred
  into a dozen unequal fragments it startled him
  extremely

    when he had recovered a little from his shock
  he went and sniffed curiously at the representative
  pieces of the fallen projectile they had a dis-
  tinctive flavour oddly reminiscent of the two drab
  animals of the ledge he sat up and pawed the
  larger lump and walked round it several times try-
  ing to find a man about it somewhere   

    when night had come he went off down the river
  gorge to see if he could cut off either of the ledges
  occupants the ledge was empty there were no
  signs of the red thing but as he was rather hungry
  he did not loiter long that night but pushed on to
  pick up a red deer fawn he forgot about the
  drab animals he found a fawn but the doe was
  close by and made an ugly fight for her young
  andoo had to leave the fawn but as her blood was
  up she stuck to the attack and at last he got in a
  blow of his paw on her nose and so got hold of
  her more meat but less delicacy and the she-bear
  following had her share the next afternoon curi-
  ously enough the very fellow of the first white rock
  fell and smashed precisely according to precedent

    the aim of the third that fell the night after
  however was better it hit andoos unspeculative
  skull with a crack that echoed up the cliff and the
  white fragments went dancing to all the points of
  the compass- the she-bear coming after him and
  sniffing curiously at him found him lying in an
  odd sort of attitude with his head wet and all out
  of shape she was a young she-bear and inexperi-
  enced and having sniffed about him for some time
  and licked him a little and so forth she decided to
  leave him until the odd mood had passed and went
  on her hunting alone

    she looked up the fawn of the red doe they had
  killed two nights ago and found it but it was
  lonely hunting without andoo and she returned
  caveward before dawn the sky was grey and over-
  cast the trees up the gorge were black and unfamil-
  iar and into her ursine mind came a dim sense of
  strange and dreary happenings she lifted up her
  voice and called andoo by name the sides of the
  gorge reechoed her

    as she approached the caves she saw in the half
  light and heard a couple of jackals scuttle off and
  immediately after a hyaena howled and a dozen
  clumsy bulks went lumbering up the slope and
  stopped and yelled derision lord of the rocks
  and caves-va-ha came down the wind the dis-
  mal feeling in the she-bears mind became suddenly
  acute she shuffled across the amphitheatre

    ya-ha said the hyaenas retreating ya-ha

    the cave bear was not lying quite in the same
  attitude because the hyaenas had been busy and in
  one place his ribs showed white dotted over the
  turf about him lay the smashed fragments of the
  three great lumps of chalk and the air was full
  of the scent of death

    the she-bear stopped dead even now that the
  great and wonderful andoo was killed was beyond
  her believing then she heard far overhead a sound
  a queer sound a little like the shout of a hyaena but
  fuller and lower in pitch she looked up her little
  dawn-blinded eyes seeing little her nostrils quiver-
  ing and there on the cliff edge far above her
  against the bright pink of dawn were two little


amazing stories

shaggy round dark tilings the heads of eudena and
ugh-lomi as they shouted derision at her but
though she could not see them very distinctly she
could hear and dimly she began to apprehend a
novel feeling as of imminent strange evils came into
her heart

  she began to examine the smashed fragments of
chalk that lay about andoo for a space she stood
still looking about her and making a low continu-
ous sound that was almost a moc i then she went
back incredulously to andoo to make one last effort
to rouse him

chapter iii

the first horseman

in the days before ugh-lomi there was little
trouble between the horses and men they
lived apart-the men in the river swamps and
thickets the horses on the wide grassy uplands be-
tween the chestnuts and the pines sometimes a
pony would come straying into the clogging marshes
to make a flint-hacked meal and sometimes the tribe
would find one the kill of a lion and drive off the
jackals and feast heartily while the sun was high
these horses of the old time were clumsy at the fet-
lock and dun-coloured with a rough tail and big
head they came every spring-time north-westward
into the country after the swallows and before the
hippopotami as the grass on the wide downland
stretches grew long they came only in small bodies
thus far each herd a stallion and two or three mares
and a foal or so having its own stretch of country
and they went again when the chestnut-trees were
yellow and the wolves came down the wealden
mountains

  it was their custom to graze right out in the open
going into cover only in the heat of the day they
avoided the long stretches of thorn and beechwood
preferring an isolated group of trees void of ambus-
cade so that it was hard to come upon them they
were never fighters their heels and teeth were for
one another but in the clear country once they were
started no living thing came near them though per-
haps the elephant might have done so had he felt
the need and in those days man seemed a harm-
less thing enough no whisper of prophetic intelli-
gence told the species of the terrible slavery that
was to come of the whip and spur and bearing-rein
the clumsy load and the slippery street the insuffi-
cient food and the knackers yard that was to replace
the wide grass-land and the freedom of the earth

  down in the wey marshes ugh-lomi and eudena
had never seen the horses closely but now they saw
them every day as the two of them raided out from
their lair on the ledge in the gorge raicjing together
in search of food they had returned to the ledge
after the killing of andoo for of the she-bear they
were not afraid the she-bear had become afraid
of them and when she winded them she went aside
the two went together everywhere for since they
left the tribe eudena was not so much ugh-lomis
woman as his mate she learnt to hunt even-ras
much that is as any woman could she was indeed
a marvellous woman he would lie for hours watch-
ing a beast or planning catches in that shock head

of his and she would stay beside him with her
bright eyes upon him offering no irritating sugges-
tions-as still as any man a wonderful woman

  at the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn
and then beechwoods and going through the beech-
woods one came to the edge of the rolling grassy
expanse and in sight of the horses here on the
edge of the wood and bracken were the rabbit-
burrows and here among the fronds eudena and
ugh-lomi would lie with their throwing-stones ready
until the little people came out to nibble and play
in the sunset and while eudena would sit a silent
figure of watchfulness regarding the burrows ugh-
lomis eyes were ever away across the greensward
at those wonderful grazing strangers

  in a dim way he appreciated their grace and their
supple nimbleness as the sun declined in the eve-
ning-time and the heat of the day passed theyr
would become active would start chasing one an-
other neighing dodging shaking their manes com-
ing round in great curves sometimes so close that
the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thun-
der it looked so fine that ugh-lomi wanted to join
in badly and sometimes one would roll over on
the turf kicking four hoofs heavenward which
seemed formidable and was certainly much less al-
luring

  dim imaginings ran through ugh-lomis mind as
he watched-by virtue of which two rabbits lived
the longer and sleeping his brains were clearer
and bolder-for that was the way in those days he
came near the hrses he dreamt and fought sniit-
rng-sjtgne against hoof but then the horses changed
to men or at least to men with horses heads and
he awoke in a cold sweat of terror

  yet the next day in the morning as the horses
were grazing one of the mares whinnied and they
saw ugh-lomi coming up the wind they all stopped
their eating and watched him ugh-lomi was hot
coming towards them but strolling obliquely across
the open looking at anything in the world but
horses he had stuck three fern-fronds into the
mat of his hair giving him a remarkable appearance
and he walked very slowly whats up now said
the master horse who was capable but inexper-
ienced

  it looks more like the first half of an animal
than anything else in the world he said fore-
legs and no hind

  its only one of those pink monkey things said
the eldest mare theyre a sort bf river monkey
theyre quite common on the plains

  ugh-lomi continued his oblique advance the
eldest mare was struck with the want of motive in
his proceedings

  fool said the eldest mare in a quick conclusive
way she had she resumed her grazing the mas-
ter horse and the second mare followed suit

  look lies nearer said the foal with a stripe

  one of the younger foals made uneasy move-
ments ugh-lomi squatted down and sat regarding
the horses fixedly in a little while he was satisfied
that they meant neither flight nor hostilities he be-
gan to consider his next procedure he did not
feel anxious to kill but he had his axe with him and
the spirit of sport was upon him how would one
kill one of these creatures--these great beautiful
creatures
a story of the stone age



eudena watching him with a fearful admira-
tion from the cover of the bracken saw him
presently go on all fours and so proceed again but
the horses preferred him a biped to a quadruped
and the master horse threw up his head and gave
the word to move ugh-lomi thought they were off
for good but after a minutes gallop they came
round in a wide curve and stood winding him
then as a rise in the ground hid him they tailed
out the master horse leading and approached him
spirally

   he was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse as
they were of his and at this stage it would seem
he funked he knew this kind of stalking would
make red deer or buffalo charge if it were persisted
in at any rate eudena saw him jump up and come
walking towards her with the fern plumes held in
his hand

  she stood up and he grinned to show that the
whole thing was an immense lark and that what he
had done was just what he had planned to do from
the very beginning so that incident ended but
he was very thoughtful all that day

  the next day this foolish drab creature with the
leonine mane instead of going about the grazing
or hunting he was made for was prowling round
the horses again the eldest mare was all for
silent contempt  suppose he wants to learn some-
thing from us she said and let him the next
day he was at it again the master horse decided
lie meant absolutely nothing but as a matter of
fact ugh-lomi the first of men to feel that curious
spell of the horse that binds us even to this day
meant a great deal he admired them unreservedly
there was a rudiment of the snob in him i am
afraid and he wanted to be near tl se beautifully-
curved animals then there were vague concep-
tions of a kill if only they would let him come
near them but they drew the line he found at
fifty yards if he came nearer than that they moved
off-with dignity i suppose it was the way he had
blinded andoo that made him think of leaping 
the back of one of them but though eudena after
a time came out in the open too and they did some
unobtrusive stalking things stopped there

  then one memorable day a new idea came to
ugh-lomi the horse looks down and level but he
does not ook utj no animals look up-they have
too much common-sense it was only that fantastic
reature man could waste his wits skyward ugh-
lomi made no philosophical deductions but he per-
ceived the thing was so so he spent a wearv day
in a beech that stood in the open while eudena
stalked usually the horses went into the shade in
the heat of the afternoon but that day the sky was
overcast and they would not in spite of eudenas
solicitude

  it was two days later that ugh-lomi had his de-
sire the day was blazing hot and the multiplying
flies asserted themselves the horses stopped graz-
ing before mid-day and came into the shadow below
him and stood in ouples nose to tail flapping

  the master horse by virtue of his heels came
closest to the tree and suddenly ther was a rustle
and a creak a thud    then a sharp chipped
flint bit him  the cheek the master horse stum-
bled came on one knee rose to his feet and was off
like the wind the air was full of the vhirl of limbs
the prance of hoofs and snorts of alarm ugh-lomi

was pitched a foot in the air came down again up
again his stomach was hit violently and then his
knees got a grip of something between them he
found himself clutching with knees feet and hands
careering violently with extraordinary oscillation
through the air-his axe gone heaven knows whither
hold tight said mother instinct and he did

  he was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face
some of it between his teeth and of green turf
streaming past in front of his eyes he saw the
shoulder of the master horse vast and sleek with the
muscles flowing swiftly under the skin he perceived
that his arms were round the neck and that the vio-
lent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm

  then he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree-
stems and then there were fronds of bracken about
and then more open turf then a stream of peb-
bles rushing past little pebbles flying sideways
athwart the stream from the blow of the swift hoofs
ugh-lomi began to feel frightfully sick and giddy
but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because
he was uncomfortable

  he dared not leave his grip but he tried to make
himself more comfortable he released his hug on
the neck gripping the mane instead he slipped
his knees forward and pushing back came into a
sitting position where the quarters broaden it was
nervous work but he managed it and at last he was
fairly seated astride breathless indeed and uncer-
tain but with that frightful pounding of his body at
any rate relieved

slowly the fragments of ugh-lomis mind got
into order again the pace seemed to him ter-
rific but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust
his first frantic terror the air rushed by sweet
and wonderful the rhythm of the hoofs changed
and broke up and returned into itself again they
were on turf now a wide glade-the beech-trees a
hundred yards away on either side and a succulent
band of green starred with pink blossom and shot
with silver water here and there meandered down
the middle far off was a glimpse of blue vallev-
far away the exultation grew it was mans first
taste of pace

  then came a wide space dappled with flying fal-
low deer scattering this way and that and then a
couple of jackals mistaking ugh-lomi for a lion
came hurrying after him and when they saw it was
not a lion they still came on out of curiosity on
galloped the horse with his one idea of escape and
after him the jackals with pricked ears and quickly-
barked remarks which killswhich  said the first
jackal its the horse being killed said the second
they gave the howl of following and the horse an-
swered to it as a horse answers nowadays to the
spur

   o they rushed a little tornado through the quiet
day putting up startled birds sending a dozen un-
expected things darting to cover raising a myriad
of indignant dung-flies smashing little blossoms
flowering complacently back into their parental turf
trees again and then splash splash across a torrent
then a hare shot out of a tuft of grass under the very
hoofs of the master horse and the jackals left them
incontinently so presently they broke into the open
again a wide expanse of turfy hillside-the very
grassy downs that fall northward nowadays from
the epsom stand


amazing stories



  the first hot bolt of the master horse was long
since over he was falling into a measured trot
and ugh-lomi albeit bruised exceedingly and quite
uncertain of the future was in a state of glorious
enjoyment and now came a new development the
pace broke again the master horse came round on
a short curve and stopped dead   

  ugh-lomi became alert he wished he had a flint
but the throwing flint he had carried in a thong
about his waist was-like the axe-heaven knows
where the master horse turned his head and
ugh-lomi became aware of an eye and teeth he
whipped his leg into a position of security and hit
at the cheek with his fist then the head went down
somewhere out of existence apparently and the back
he was sitting on flew up into a dome ugh-lomi
became a thing of instinct again-strictly prehen-
sible he held by knees and feet and his head seemed
sliding towards the turf his fingers were twisted
into the shock of mane and the rough hair of the
horse saved him the gradient he was on lowered
again and then-whup said ugh-lomi aston-
ished and the slant was the other way up but
ugh-lomi was a thousand generations nearer the
primordial than man no monkey could have held
on better and the lion had been training the horse
for countless generations against the tactics of roll-
ing and rearing back but he kicked like a master
and buck-jumped rather neatly in five minutes
ugh-lomi lived a lifetime if he came off the horse
would kill him he felt assured

  then the master horse decided to stick to his old
tactics again and suddenly went off at a gallop he
headed down the slope taking the steep places at a
rush swerving neither to the right nor to the left
and as they rode down the wide expanse of valley
sank out of sigfit behind the approaching skirmishers
of oak and hawthorn they skirted a sudden hollow
with the pool of a spring rank weeds and silver
bushes the ground grew softer and the grass
taller and on the right-hand side and the left came
scattered bushes of may-still splashed with belated
blossom presently the bushes thickened until they
lashed the passing rider and little flashes and gouts
of blood came out on horse and man then the way
opened again

  and then came a wonderful adventure a sud-
-ix den squeal of unreasonable anger rose amidst
the bushes the squeal of some creature bitterly
wronged and crashing after them appeared a big
grey-blue shape it was yaaa the big-horned rhinoc-
eros in one of those fits of fury of his charging
full tilt after the manner of his kind he had been
startled at his feeding and someone it did not mat-
ter who was to be ripped and trampled therefore
he was bearing down on them from the left with
his wicked little eye red his great horn down and
his tail like a jury-mast behind him for a minute
ugh-lomi was minded to slip off and dodge and
then behold the staccato of the hoofs grew swifter
and the rhinoceros and his stumpy hurrying little
legs seemed to slide out at the back corner of ugh-
lornis eye in two minutes they were through the
bushes of may and out in the open going fast for
a space he could hear the ponderous paces in pursuit
receding behind him and then it was just as if yaaa
had not lost his temper as if yaaa had never existed

  the pace never faltered on they rode and on

  ugh-lomi was now all exultation to exult in
those days was to insult ya-ha big nose he
said trying to crane back and see some remote speck
of a pursuer why dont you carry your smiting-
stone in your fist he ended with a frantic whoop

  but that whoop was unfortunate for coming close
to the ear of the horse and being quite unexpected
it startled the stallion extremely he shied violently
ugh-lomi suddenly found himself uncomfortable
again he was hanging on to the horse he found
by one arm and one knee

  the rest of the ride was honourable but unpleas-
ant the view was chiefly of blue sky and that was
combined with the most unpleasant physical sensa-
tions finally a bush of thorn lashed him and he
let go

  he hit the ground with his cheek and shoulder
and then after a complicated and extraordinarily rap-
id movement hit it again with the end of his back-
bone lie saw splashes and sparks of light and
colour the ground seemed bouncing about just
like the horse had done then he found he was sit-
ting on turf six yards beyond the bush in front of
him was a space of grass growing greener and
greener and a number of human beings in the dis-
tance and the horse was going round at a smart
gallop quite a long way off to the right

  the human beings were  the opposite side of
the river some still in the water but they were all
running away as hard as they could go the advent
of a monster that took to pieces was not the sort of
novelty they cared for for quite a minute ugh-
lomi sat regarding them in a purely spectacular
spirit the bend of the river the knoll among the
reeds and royal ferns the thin streams of smoke go-
ing up to heaven were all perfectly familiar to him
it was the squatting-place of the sons of uya of
uya from whom he had fled with eudena and
whom he had waylaid in the chestnut woods and
killed with the first axe

  he rose to his feet still dazed from his fall and
as he did so the scattering fugitives turned and re-
garded him some pointed to the receding horse
and chattered he walked slowly towards them
staring he forgot the horse he forgot his own
bruises in the growing interest of this encounter
there were fewer of them than there had been-
he supposed the others must have hid-the heap of
fern for the night fire was not so high by the flint
heaps should have sat wau-but then he remem-
bered be had killed wau suddenly brought back to
this familiar scene the gorge and the bears and
eudena seemed things remote things dreamt of

  he stopped at the bank and stood regarding the
tribe his mathematical abilities were of the slight-
est but it was certain there were fewer the men
might be away but there were fewer women and chil-
dren he gave the shout of home-coming his
quarrel had been with uya and wau-not with the
others children of uva he cried they an-
swered with his name a little fearfully because of
the strange way he had come

  for a space they spoke together then an old
woman lifted a shrill voice and answered him our
lord is a lion

  ugh-lomi did not understand that saying they
answered him again several together uya comes
again he comes as a lion our lord is a lion
he comes at night he slays whom he will but
a story of the stone age



none other may slay us ugh-lomi none other may
slay us

  still ugh-lomi did not understand

  our lord is a lion he speaks no more to men

  ugh-lomi stood regarding them he had had
dreams-he knew that though he had killed uya
uya still existed and now they told him uya was
a lion

  the shrivelled old woman the mistress of the
fire-minders suddenly turned and spoke softly to
those next to her she was a very old woman in-
deed she had been the first of uyas wives and he
he had let her live beyond the age to which it is
seemly a woman should be permitted to live she
had been cunning from the first cunning to please
uya and to get food and now she was great in
counsel she spoke softly and ugh-lomi watched
her shrivelled form across the river with a curious
distaste then she called aloud come over to us
ugh-lomi

a girl suddenly lifted up her voice come
over to us ugh-lomi she said and they all
began crying come over to us ugh-lomi

  it was strange how their manner changed after
the old woman called

  he stood quite still watching them all it was
pleasant to be called and the girl who had called
first was a pretty one but she made him think of
eudena

  come over to us ugh-lomi they cried and the
voice of the shrivelled old woman rose above them
all at the sound of her voice his hesitation re-
turned

  he stood on the river bank ugh-lomi-ugh the
thinker-with his thoughts slowly taking shape
presently one and then another paused to see what
he would do he was minded to go back he was
minded not to suddenly his fear or his caution got
the upper hand without answering them he turned
and walked back towards the distant thorn-trees the
way he had come forthwith the whole tribe started
crying to him again very eagerly he hesitated and
turned then he went on then he turned again and
then once again regarding them with troubled eyes
as they called the last time he took two paces
back before his fear stopped him they saw him
stop once more and suddenly shake his head and
vanish among the hawthorn-trees

  then all the women and children lifted up their
voices together and called to him in one last vain
effort

  far down the river the reeds were stirring in the
breeze where convenient for his new sort of feed-
ing the old lion who had taken to man-eating had
made his lair

  the old woman turned her face that way and
pointed to the hawthorn thickets uya she
screamed there goes thine enemy there goes
thine enemy uya why do you devour us nightly 
we have tried to snare him there goes thine
enemy uya

  but the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking
his siesta the crv went unheard that day he had
dined on one of the plumper girls and his mood was
a comfortable placidity he really did not under-
stand that he was uya or that ugh-omi was his
enemy

  so it was that ugh-lomi rode the horse and heard

first of uya the lion who had taken the place of uya
the master and was eating up the tribe and as he
hurried back to the gorge his mind was no longer
full of the horse but of the thought that uya was
still alive to slay or be slain over and over again
he saw the shrunken band of women and children
crying that uya was a lion uya was a lion

  and presently fearing the twilight might come
upon him ugh-lomi began running

chapter iv

uya the lion

the old lion was in luck the tribe had a cer-
tain pride in their ruler but that was all the
satisfaction they got out of it he came the
very night that ugh-lomi killed uya the cunning
and so it was they named him uya it was the old
woman the fire-minder who first named him uya
a shower had lowered the fires to a glow and made
the night dark and as they conversed together and
peered at one another in the darkness and wondered
fearfully what uya would do to them in their
dreams now that he was dead they heard the mount-
ing reverberations of the lions roar close at hand
then everything was still

  they held their breath so that almost the only
sounds were the patter pf the rain and the hiss of
the raindrops in the ashes and then after an in-
terminable time a crash and a shriek of fear and
a growling they sprang to their feet shouting
screaming running this way and that but brands
would not burn and in a minute the victim was be-
ing dragged away through the ferns it was irk
the brother of wau

  so the lion came

  the ferns were still wet from the rain the next
night and he came and took click with the red hair
that sufficed for two nights and then in the dark
between the moons he came three nights night after
night and that though they had good fires he was
an old lion with stumpy teeth but very silent and
very cool he knew of fires before these were not
the first of mankind that had ministered to his old
age the third night he came letween the outer
fire and the inner and he leapt the flint heap and
pulled down irm the son of irk who hadseemed
like to be the leader that was a dreadful night
because they lit great flares of fern and ran scream-
ing and the lion missed his hold of irm by the
glare of the fire they saw irm struggle up and run
a little way towards them and then the lion in two
bounds had him down again that was the last of
irm

  so	fear came and all the delight of spring passed
out of their lives already there were five gone out
of the tribe and four nights added three more to
the number food-seeking became spiritless none
knew who might go next and all day the women
toiled even the favourite women gathering litter
and sticks for the night fires and the hunters
hunted ill in the warm spring-time hunger came
again as though it was still winter the tribe might
have moved had they had a leader but they had no
leader and none knew where to go that the lion
could not follow them so the old lion waxed fat
and thanked heaven for the kindly race of men two
of the children and a youth died while the moon was


amazing stories

still new and then it was the shrivelled old fire-
rninder first bethought herself in a dream of eudena
and ugh-lomi and of the way uya had been slain
she had lived in fear of uya all her days and now
she lived in fear of the lion that ugh-lomi could
kill uya for good-ugh-lomi whom she had seen
born-was impossible it was uya still seeking his
enemy

  and then came the strange return of ugh-lomi
a wonderful animal seen galloping far across the
river that suddenly changed into two animals a
horse and a man following this portent the vision
of ugh-lomi on the farther bank of the river   
yes it was all plain to her uya was punishing
them -because they had not hunted down ugh-lomi
and eudena

  t he men came straggling back to the chances of
the night while the sun was still golden in the sky
they were received with the story of ugh-lomi she
went across the river with them and showed them
his spoor hesitating on the farther bank siss the
tracker knew the feet for ugh-lomis uya needs
ugh-lomi cried the old woman standing on the
left of the bend a gesticulating figure of flaring
bronze in the sunset her cries were strange sounds
flitting to and fro  the borderland of speech but
this was the sense they carried the lion needs
eudena he comes night after night seeking eu-
dena and ugh-lomi when he cannot find eudena
and ugh-lomi he grows angry and he kills hunt
eudena and ugh-lomi eudena whom he pursued
and ugh-lomi for whom he gave the death-word
hunt eudena and ugh-lomi

  she turned to the distant reed-bed as sometimes
she had turned  uya in his life is it not so my
lord she cried and as if in answer the tall
reeds bowed before a breath of wind

  far into the twilight the sound of hacking was
beard from the squatting-places it was the men
sharpening their ashen spears against the hunting
nf the morrow and in the night early before the
moon rose the lion came and took the girl of siss the
tracker

  in the morning before the sun had risen siss the
tracker and the lad wau-hau who now chipped
flints and one eye and bo and the snail-eater the
two red-haired men and cats-skin and snae all
the men that were left alive of the sons of uya
taking their ash spears and their smiting-stones and
with throwing stones in the beast-paw bags started
forth upon the trail of ugh-lomi through the haw-
thorn thickets where yaaa the rhinoceros and his
brothers were feeding and up the bare downland
towards the beechwoods

  that night the fires burnt high and fierce as the
waxing moon set and the lion left the crouching
women and children in peace

  and the next day while the sun was still high
the hunters returned-all save one eye-who lay
dead with a smashed skull at the foot of the ledge

  when ugh-lomi came back that evening from
stalking the horses he found the vultures already
busy over him and with them the hunters brought
eudena bruised and wounded but alive that had
been the strange order of the shrivelled old woman
that she was to be brought alive-she is no kill
for us she is for uya the lion her hands were
tied with thongs as though she had been a man and
she came weary and drooping-her hair over her

eyes and matted with blood they walked about
her and ever and again the snail-eater whose name
she had given would laugh and strike her with his
ashen spear and after he had struck her with his
spear he would look over his shoulder like one who
had done an over-bold deed the others too looked
over their shoulders ever and again and all were in
a hurry save eudena when the old woman saw
them coming she cried aloud with joy

  they made eudena cross the river with her hands
tied although the current was strong and when she
slipped the old woman screamed first with joy and
then for fear she might be drowned and when
they had dragged eudena to shore she could not
stand for a time albeit they beat her sore so they
let her sit with her feet touching the water and her
eyes staring before her and her face set whatever
they might do or say all the tribe came down to
the squatting-place even curly little haha who as
yet could scarcely toddle and stood staring at eu-
dena anl the old woman as now we should stare at
some strange wounded beast and its captor

the old woman tore off the necklace of uya
that was about eudenas neck and put it on
herself-she had been the first to wear it then
she tore at eudenas hair and took a spear from
siss and beat her with all her might and when
she had vented the warmth of her heart on the girl
she looked closely into her face eudenas eyes were
closed and her features were set and she lay so still
that for a moment the old woman feared she was
dead and then her nostrils quivered at that the
old woman slapped her face and laughed and gave
the spear to siss again- and went a little way off
from her and began to talk and jeer at her after her
manner

  the old woman had more words than any in the
tribe and her talk was a terrible thing to hear
sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently
and sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was
the mere phantom of thoughts but she conveyed to
eudena nevertheless mucn of the things that were
yet to come of the lion and of the torment he would
do her and ugh-lomi ha ha ugh-lomi is
slain 

  and suddenly eudenas eyes opened and she sat
up again and her look met the old womans fair and
level no she said slowly like one trying to re-
member i did not see my ugh-lomi slain  did
not see my ugh-lomi slain

  tell her cried the old woman tell her-he
that killed him tell her how ugh-lomi was slain

  she looked and all the women and children there
looked from man to man

  none answered her they stood shamefaced

  tell her said the old woman the men looked
at one another

  eudenas face suddenly lit

  tel her she said tell her mighty men tell
her the killing of ugh-lomi

  the old woman rose and struck her sharply across
her mouth

  we could not find ugh-lomi said siss the
tracker slowly who hunts two kills none

  then eudenas heart leapt but she kept her face
hard it was as well for the old woman looked at
her sharply with murder in her eyes

  then the old woman turned her tongue upon the
a story of the stone age



men because they had feared to go on after ugh-
lomi she dreadeclno one now uya was slain she
scolded them as one scolds children and they
scowled at her and began to accuse one another
until suddenly siss the tracker raised his voice and
bade her hold her peace

  and so when the sun was setting they took eu-
dena and went-though their hearts sank within
them-along the trail the old lion had made in the
reeds all the men went together at one place
was a group of alders and here they hastily bound
eudena where the lion might find her when he came
abroad in the twilight and having done so they hur-
ried back until they were near the squatting-place
then they stopped siss stopped first and looked
back again at the alders they could see her head
even from the squatting-place a little black shock
under the limb of the larger tree that was as well

  all the women and children stood watching upon
the crest of the mound and the old woman stood
and screamed for the lion to take her whom he
sought and counselled him on the torments he might
do her

  eudena was very weary now stunned by beatings
and fatigue and sorrow and only the fear of the
thing that was still to come upheld her the sun was
broad and blood-red between the stems of the distant
chestnuts and the west was all on fire the evening
breeze had died to a warm tranquillity the air was
full of midge swarms the fish in the river hard by
would leap at times and now and again a cockchafer
would drone through the air out of the corner of
her eye eudena could see a part of the squatting-
knoll and little figures standing and staring at her
and-a very little sound but very clear-she could
hear the beating of the firestone dark and near to
her and still was the reed-fringed thicket of the lair

  presently the firestone ceased she looked for the
sun and found he had gone and overhead and grow-
ing brighter was the waxing moon she looked to-
wards the thicket of the lair seeking shapes in the
reeds and then suddenly she began to wriggle and
wriggle weeping and calling upon ugh-lomi

  but ugh-lomi was far away when they saw her
head moving with her struggles they shouted to-
gether on the knoll and she desisted and was still
and then came the bats and the star that was like
ugh-lomi crept out of its blue hiding-place in the
west she called to it but softly because she feared
the lion and all through the coming of the twilight
the thicket was still

so the dark crept upon eudena and the moon
grew bright and the shadows of things that had
fled up the hillside and vanished with the evening
came back to them short and black and the dark
shapes in the thicket of reeds and alders where the
lion lay gathered and a faint stir began there but
nothing came out therefrom all through the gather-
ing of the darkness

   she looked at the squatting-place and saw the fires
glowing smokv-red and the men and women going
to and fro the other way over the river a white
mist was rising then far away came the whimper-
ing of young foxes and the yell of a hyaena

  there were long gaps of aching waiting after a
long time some animal splashed in the water and
seemed to cross the river at the ford beyond the lair
but what animal it was she could not see from the

distant drinking-pools she could hear the sound of
splashing and the noise of elephants-so still was
the night

  the earth was now a colourless arrangement of
white reflections and impenetrable shadows under
the blue sky the silvery moon was already spotted
with the filigree crests of the chestnut woods and
over the shadowy eastward hills the stars were mul-
tiplying the knoll fires were bright red now and
black figures stood waiting against them they were
waiting for a scream    surely it would be soon

  the night suddenly seemed full of movement she
held her breath things were passing-one two
three-subtly sneaking shadows    jackals

  then a long waiting again

  then asserting itself as real at once over all the
sounds her mind had imagined came a stir in the
thicket then a vigorous movement there was a
snap the reds crashed heavily once twice thrice
and then everything was still save a measured swish-
ing she heard a low tremulous growl and then
everything was still again the stillness lengthened
-would it never end  she held her breath she bit
her lips to stop screaming then something scuttled
through the undergrowth her scream was involun-
tary she did not hear the answering yell from the
mound

  immediately the thicket woke up to vigorous
movement again she saw the grass stems waving in
the light of the setting moon the alders swaying
she struggled violently-her last struggle but
nothing came towards her a dozen monsters seemed
rushing about in that little place for a couple of
minutes and then again came silence the moon
sank behind the distant chestnuts and the night was
dark

  then an odd sound a sobbing panting that grew
faster and fainter yet another silence and then
dim sounds and the grunting of some animal

  everything was still again far away eastwards
an elephant trumpeted and from the woods came a
snarling and yelping that died away

  in the long interval the moon shone out again be-
tween the stems of the trees on the ridge sending
two great bars of light and a bar of darkness across
the reedy waste then came a steady rustling a
splash and the reeds swayed wider and wider apart
and at last they broke open cleft from root to
crest    the end had come

  she looked to see the thing that had come out of
the reeds for a moment it seemed certainly the
great head and jaw she expected and then it dwin-
dled and changed it was a dark low thing that
remained silent but it was not the lion it became
still-everything became still she peered it was
like some gigantic frog two limbs and a slanting
body its head moved about searching the shadows

a rustle and it moved clumsily with a sort
of hopping and as it moved it gave a low
groan

  the blood rushing through her veins was sud-
denly joy ugh-lomi she whispered

  the thing stopped eudena he answered softly
with pain in his voice and peering into the alders

  he moved again and came out of the shadow be-
yond the reeds into the moonlight all his body
was covered with dark smears she saw he was
dragging his legs and that he gripped his axe the


amazing stories

first axe in one hand in another moment he had
struggled into the position of all fours and had
staggered over to her the lion he said in a
strange mingling of exultation and anguish wau
-i have slain a lion with my own hand even
as i slew the great bear he moved to emphasize
his words and suddenly broke off with a faint cry
for a space he did not move

  let me free whispered eudena   

  he answered her no words but pulled himself up
from his crawling attitude by means of the alder
stem and hacked at her thongs with the sharp edge
of his axe she heard him sob at each blow lie
cut away the thongs about her chest and arms and
then his hand dropped his chest struck against
her shoulder and he slipped down beside her and
lay still

  but the rest of her release was easy very hast-
ily she freed herself she made one step from the
tree and her head was spinning her last conscious
movement was towards him she reeled and
dropped her band fell upon his thigh it was
soft and wet and gave way under her pressure he
cried out at her touch and writhed and lay still
again

  presently a dark dog-like shape came very softly
through the reeds then stopped dead and stood
sniffing hesitated and at last turned and slunk back
into the shadows

  long was the time they remained there motion-
less with the light of the setting moon shining on
their limbs very slowly as slowly as the setting
of the moon did the shadow of the reeds towards
the mound flow over them presently their legs were
hidden and ugh-lomi was but a bust of silver the
shadow crept to his neck crept over his face and
so at last the darkness of the night swallowed them
up-

  the shadow became full of instinctive stirrings
there was a patter of feet and a faint snarling-
the sound of a blow

there was little sleep that night for the wo-
men and children at the squatting-place until
they heard eudena scream but the men were weary
and sat dozing when eudena screamed they felt
assured of their safety and hurried to get the near-
est places to the fires the old woman laughed at
the scream and laughed again because si the little
friend of eudena whimpered directly the dawn
came they were all alert and looking towards the al-
ders they could see that eudena had been taken
they could not help feeling glad to think that uya
was appeased but across the minds of the men
the thought of ugh-lomi fell like a shadow they
could understand revenge for the world was old
in revenge but they did not think of rescue sud-
denly a hyaena fled out of the thicket and came gal-
loping across the reed space his muzzle and paws
were dark-stained at that sight all the men shouted
and clutched at throwing-stones and ran towards
him for no animal is so pitiful a coward as the
hysena by day all men hated the hyaena became he
preyed on children and would come and bite when
one was sleeping on the edge of the squatting-place
and cats-skin throwing fair and straight hit the
brute shrewdly on the flank whereat the whole tribe
yelled with delight

  at the noise they made there came a flapping of

wings from the lair of the lion and three white-
headed vultures rose slowly and circled and came to
rest amidst the branches of an alder overlooking the
lair our lord is abroad said the old woman
pointing the vultures have their share of eu-
dena for a space they remained there and then
first one and then another dropped back into the
thicket

  then over the eastern woods and touching the
whole world to life and colour poured with the ex-
altation of a trumpet blast the light of the rising
sun at the sight of him the children shouted to-
gether and clapped their hands and began to race
off towards the water only little si lagged behind
and looked wonderinglv at the alders where she had
seen the head of eudena overnight

  but uya the old lion was not abroad but at
home and he lay very still and a little on one side
he was not in his lair but a little way from it in a
place of trampled grass under one eye was a little
wound the feeble little bite of the first axe but all
the ground beneath his chest was ruddy brown with
a vivid streak and in his chest was a little hole that
had been made by ugh-lomis stabbing-spear along
his side and at his neck the vultures had marked
their claims for so ugh-lomi had slain him lying
stricken under his paw and thrusting haphazard at
his chest he had driven the spear in with all his
strength and stabbed the giant to the heart so it
was the reign of the lion of the second incarnation
of uya the master came to an end

  from the knoll the bustle of preparation grew
the hacking of spears and throwing-stones none
spake the name of ugh-lomi for fear that it might
bring him the men were going to keep together
close together in the hunting for a day or so and
their hunting was to be ugh-lomi lest instead he
should come a-hunting them

  but ugh-lomi was lying very still and silent out-
side the lions lair and eudena squatted beside him
with the ash spear all smeared with lions blood
gripped in her hand

chapter v

the fight in the lions thicket

ugh-lomi lay still his back against an alder
and his thigh was a red mass terrible to see
no civilized man could have lived who had
been so sorely wounded but eudena got him thorns
to close his wounds and squatted beside him day
and night smiting the flies from him with a fan of
reeds by day and in the night threatening the hyaenas
with the first axe in her hand and in a little while
he began to heal it was high summer and there was
no rain little food they had during the first two
days his wounds were open in the low place where
they hid were no roots nor little beasts and the
stream with its water-snails and fish was in the
open a hundred yards away she could not go abroad
by day for fear of the tribe her brothers and sisters
nor by night for fear of the beasts both on his ac-
count and hers so they shared the lion with the
vultures but there was a trickle of water near by
and eudena brought him plenty in her hands

  where ugh-lomi lay was well hidden from the
tribe by a thicket of alders and all fenced about with
bulrushes and tall reeds the dead lion he had
a story of the stone age



killed lay near his old lair on a place of trampled
reeds fifty yards away in sight through the reed-
stems and the vultures fought each other for the
choicest pieces and kept the jackals off him very
soon a cloud of flies that looked like bees hung over
him and ugh-lomi could hear their humming and
when ugh-lomis flesh was already healing-and it
was not many days before that began-only a few
bones of the lion remained scattered and shining
white

  for the most part ugh-lomi sat still during the
day looking before him at nothing sometimes he
would mutter of the horses and bears and lions and
sometimes he would beat the ground with the first
axe and say the names of the tribe-he seemed to
have no fear of bringing the tribe-for hours to-
gether but chiefly he slept dreaming little because
of his loss of blood and the slightness of his food
during the short summer night both kept awake
all the while darkness lasted things moved about
them things they never saw by day for some
nights the hyaenas did not come and then one moon-
less night near a dozen came and fought for what
was left of the lion the night was a tumult of
growling and ugh-lomi and eudena could hear the
bones snap in their teeth but they knew the hyaena
dare not attack any creature alive and awake and
so they were not greatly afraid

  of a daytime eudena would go along the narrow
path the old lion had made in the reeds until she
was beyond the bend and then she would creep into
the thicket and watch the tribe she would lie close
by the alders where they had bound her to offer her
up to the lion and thence she could see them on
the knoll by the fire small and clear as she had
seen them that night but she told ugh-lomi little
of what she saw because she feared to bring them
by their names for so they believed in those days
that naming called

  she saw the men prepare stabbing-spears and
throwing-stones on the morning after ugh-lomi had
slain the lion and go out to hunt him by leaving the
women and children on the knoll little they knew
how near he was as they tracked off in single file
towards the hills with siss the tracker leading
them and she watched the women and children
after the men had gone gathering fern-fronds and
twigs for the night fire and the boys and girls run-
ning and playing together  but the very old woman
made her feel afraid towards noon when most of
the others were down at the stream by the bend
she came and stood on the hither side of the knoll
a gnarled brown figure and gesticulated so that eu-
dena could scarce believe she was not seen eudena
lay like a hare in its form with shining eyes fixed on
the bent witch away there and presently she dimly
understood it was the lion the old woman was wor-
shipping-the lion ugh-lomi had slain

and the next day the hunters came back weary
l  carrying a fawn and eudena watched the
feast enviously and then came a strange thing
she saw-distinctly she heard-the old woman
shrieking and gesticulating and pointing towards
her she was afraid and crept like a snake out of
sight again but presently curiosity overcame her
and she was back at her spying-place and as she
peered her heart stopped for there were all the men

with their weapons in their hands walking together
towards her from the knoll

  she dared not move lest her movement should be
seen but she pressed herself close to the ground the
sun was low and the golden light was in the faces
of the men she saw they carried a piece of rich
red meat thrust through by an ashen stake pres-
ently they stopped go  screamed the old wo-
man cats-skin grumbled and they came on search-
ing the thicket with sun-dazzled eyes here said
siss and they took the ashen stake with the meat
upon it and thrust it into the ground uya cried
siss behold thy portion and ugh-lomi we have
slain of a truth we have slain ugh-lomi this
day we slew ugh-lomi and to-morrow we will bring 
his body to you and the others repeated the
words

  they looked at each other and behind them and
partly turned and began going back at first they
walked half turned to the thicket then facing the
mound they walked faster looking over their shoul-
ders then faster soon they ran it was a race at
last until they were near the knoll then siss who
was hindmost was first to slacken his pace

  the sunset passed and the twilight came the fires
glowed red against the hazy blue of the distant chest-
nut-trees and the voices over the mound were
merry eudena lay scarcely stirring looking from
the mound to the meat and then to the mound she
was hungry but she was afraid at last she crept
back to ugh-lomi

  he looked round at the little rustle of her approach
his face was in shadow have you got me some
food  he said

  she said she could find nothing but that she would
seek further and went back along the lions path
until she could see the mound again but she could
not bring herself to take the meat she had the
brutes instinct of a snare she felt very miserable

  she crept back at last towards ugh-lomi and heard
him stirring and moaning she turned back to the
mound again then she saw something in the dark-
ness near the stake and peering distinguished a
jackal in a flash she was brave and angry she
sprang up cried out and ran towards the offering
she stumbled and fell and heard the growling of
the jackal going off

  when she arose only the ashen stake lay on the
ground the meat was gone so she went back to
fast through the night with ugh-lomi and ugh-
lomi was angry with her because she had no food
for him but she told him nothing of the things she
had seen

  two days passed and they were near starving
when the tribe slew a horse then came the same
ceremony and a haunch was left on the ashen stake
but this time eudena did not hesitate

  by acting and words she made ugh-lomi under-
stand but he ate most of the food before he under-
stood and then as her meaning passed to him he
grew merry with his food i am uya he said
i am the lion i am the great cave bear i who
was only ugh-lomi i am wau the cunning it is
well that they should feed me for presently i will
kill them all

  then eudenas heart was light and she laughed
with him and afterwards she ate what he had left
of the horseflesh with gladness

  after that it was he had a dream and the next


amazing stories

day he made eudena bring him the lions teeth and
claws-so much of them as she could find-and hack
him a club of alder and he put the teeth and claws
very cunningly into the wood so that the points were
outward very long it took him and he blunted
two of the teeth hammering them in and was very
angry and threw the thing away but afterwards he
dragged himself to where he had thrown it and fin-
ished it-a club of a new sort set with teeth that
day there was more meat for them both an offering
to the lion from the tribe

  it was one day-more than hands fingers of days
more than anyone had skill to count-after ugh-
lomi had made the club that eudena while he was
asleep was lying in the thicket watching the squat-
ting-place there had been no meat for three days
and the old woman came and worshipped after her
manner now while she worshipped eudenas little
friend si and another the child of the first girl siss
had loved came over the knoll and stood regarding
her skinny figure and presently they began to mock
her eudena found this entertaining but suddenly
the old woman turned on them quickly and saw
them for a moment she stood and they stood mo-
tionless and then with a shriek of rage she rushed
towards them and all three disappeared over the
crest of the knoll

presently the children reappeared among the
ferns beyond the shoulder of the hill little si
ran first for she was an active girl and the other
child ran squealing with the old woman close upon
her and over the knoll came siss with a bone in
his hand and bo and cats-skin obsequiously behind
him each holding a piece of food and they laughed
aloud and shouted to see the old woman so angry
and with a shriek the child was caught and the old
woman set to work slapping and the child screaming
and it was very good after-dinner fun for them
little si ran on cf little way and stopped at last be-
tween fear and curiosity

  and suddenly came the mother of the child with
hair streaming panting and with a stone in her
hand and the old woman turned about like a wild
cat she was the equal of any woman was the chief
of the fire-minders in spite of her years but before
she could do anything siss shouted to her and the
clamour rose loud other shock heads came into
sight it seemed the whole tribe was at home and
feasting but the old woman dared not go on
wreaking herself on the child siss befriended

  everyone made noises and called names-even
little si abruptly the old woman let go of the
child and made a swift run at si for si had no
friends and si realizing her danger when it was
almost upon her made off headlong with a faint
cry of terror not heeding whither she ran straight
to the lair of the lion she swerved aside into the
reeds presently realizing now whither she went

  but the old woman was a wonderful old woman
as active as she was spiteful and she caught si by
the streaming hair within thirty yards of eudena
all the tribe now was running down the knoll and
shouting and laughing ready to see the fun

  then something stirred in eudena something
that had never stirred in her before and thinking
all f little si and nothing of her fear she sprang up
from her ambush and ran swiftly forward the old
woman did not see her for she was busy heating

 little sis face with her hand beating with all her

 heart and suddenly something hard and heavy struck
 her cheek she went reeling and saw eudena with
 flaming eyes and cheeks between her and little si
 she shrieked with astonishment and terror and little
 si not understanding set off towards the gaping
 tribe they were quite close now for the sight of
 eudena had driven their fading fear of the lion out
 of their heads

   in a moment eudena had turned from the cower-
 ing old woman and overtaken si si she cried
 si she caught the child up in her arms as it
 stopped pressed the nail-lined face to hers and
 turned about to run towards her lair the lair of the
 old lion the old woman stood waist-high in the
 reeds and screamed foul things and inarticulate
 rage but did not dare to intercept her and at the
 bend of the path eudena looked back and saw all
 the men of the tribe crying to one another and siss
 coming at a trot along the lions trail

   she ran straight along the narrow way through
 the reeds to the shady place where ugh-lomi sat
 with his healing thigh just awakened by the shout-

 	ing and rubbing his eyes she came to him a wo-
 man with little si in her arms her heart throbbed
 in her throat ugh-lomi she cried ugh-lomi
 the tribe comes

   ugh-lomi sat staring in stupid astonishment at
 her and si

   she pointed with si in one arm she sought among
 her feeble store of words to explain she could hear
 the men calling apparently they had stopped out-
 side she put down si and caught up the new club
 with the lions teeth and put it into ugh-lomis
 hand and ran three yards and picked up the first axe

   ah said ugh-lomi waving the new club and
 suddenly he perceived the occasion and rolling over
 began to struggle to his feet

   he stood but clumsily he supported himself by
 one hand against the tree and just touched the
 ground gingerly with the toe of his wounded leg
 in the other hand he gripped the new club he
 looked at his healing thigh and suddenly the reeds
 began whispering and ceased and whispered again
 and coming cautiously along the track bending down
 and holding his fire-hardened stabbing-stick of ash
 in his hand appeared siss he stopped dead and
 his eyes met ugh-lomis

 ugh-lomi forgot he had a wounded leg he
 stood firmly on both feet something trickled
 he glanced down and saw a little gout of blood had
 oozed out along the edge of the healing wound he
 rubbed his hand there to give him the grip of his
 club and fixed his eyes again on siss

   wau he cried and sprang forward and siss
 still stooping and watchful drove his stabbing-stick
 up very quickly in an ugly thrust it ripped ugh-
 lomis guarding arm and the club came down in a
 counter that siss was never to understand he fell
 as an ox falls to the pole-axe at ugh-lomis feet

   to bo it seemed the strangest thing he had a
 comforting sense of tall reeds on either side and an
 impregnable rampart siss between him and any
 danger snail-eater was close behind and there was
 no danger there he was prepared to shove behind
 and send siss to death or victory that was his
 place as second man he saw the butt of the spear
 siss carried leap away from him and suddenly a
a story of the stone age



dull whack and the broad back fell away forward
and he looked ugh-lomi in the face over his prostrate
leader it felt to bo as if his heart had fallen down
a well he had a throwing-stone in one harid and an
ashen stabbing-stick in the other he did not live to
the end of his momentary hesitation which to use

  snail-eater was a readier man and besides bo
did not fall forward as siss had done but gave at
his knees and hips crumpling up with the toothed
club upon his head the snail-eater drove his spear
forward swift and straight and took ugh-lomi in
the muscle of the shoulder and then he drove him
hard with the smiting-stone in his other hand shout-
ing out as he did so the new club swished inef-
fectually through the reeds eudena saw ugh-lomi
come staggering back from the narrow path into the
open space tripping over siss and with a foot of
ashen stake sticking out of him over his arm and
then the snail-eater whose name she had given had
his final injury from her as his exultant face came
out of the reeds after his spear for she swung the
first axe swift and high and hit him fair and square
on the temple and down he went on siss at pros-
trate ugh-lomis feet

  but before ugh-lomi could get up the two red-
haired men were tumbling out of the reeds spears
and smiting-stones ready and snake hard behind
them one she struck on the neck but not to fell
him and he blundered aside and spoilt his brothers
blow at ugh-lomis head in a moment ugh-lomi
dropped his club and had his assailant by the waist
and had pitched him sideways sprawling he
snatched at his club again and recovered it the
man eudena had hit stabbed at her with his spear as
he stumbled from her blow and involuntarily she
gave ground to avoid him he hesitated between
her and ugh-lomi half turned gave a vague cry at
finding ugh-lomi so near and in a moment ugh-
lomi had him by the throat and the club had its
third victim as he went down ugh-lomi shouted
-no words but an exultant cry

  the other red-haired man was six feet from her
with his back to her and a darker red streaking his
head he was struggling to his feet she had an
irrational impulse to stop his rising she flung the
axe at him missed saw his face in profile and he
had swerved beyond little si and was running
through the reeds she had a transitory vision of
snake standing in the throat of the path half turned
away from her and then she saw his back she
saw the club whirling through the air and the shock
head of ugh-lomi with blood in the hair and blood
upon the shoulder vanishing below the reeds in pur-
suit then she heard snake scream like a woman

  she ran past si to where the handle of the axe
stuck out of a clump of fern and turning found
herself panting and alone with three motionless bod-
ies the air was full of shouts and screams for
a space she was sick and giddy and then it came
into her head that ugh-lomi was being killed along
the reed-path and with an inarticulate cry she leapt
over the body of bo and hurried after him snakes
feet lay across the path and his head was among the
reeds she followed the path until it bent round
and opened out by the alders and thence she saw
all that was left of the tribe in the open scattering
like dead leaves before a gale and going back over
the knoll ugh-lomi was hard upon cats-skin

  but cats-skin was fleet of foot and got away and

so did young wau-hau when ugh-lomi turned upon
him and ugh-lomi pursued wau-hau far beyond
the knoll before he desisted he had the rage of
battle on him now and the wood thrust through his
shoulder stung him like a spur when she saw he
was in no danger she stopped running and stood
panting watching the distant active figures run up
and vanish one by one over the knoll in a little
time she was alone again everything had hap-
pened very swiftly the smoke of brother fire
rose straight and steady from the squatting-place
just as it had done ten minutes ago when the old
woman had stood yonder worshipping the lion

  and after a long time as it seemed ugh-lomi
ix reappeared over the knoll and came back to
eudena triumphant and breathing heavily she
stood her hair about her eyes and hot-faced with
the blood-stained axe in her hand at the place where
the tribe had offered her as a sacrifice to the lion
wau cried ugh-lomi at the sight of her his face
alight with the fellowship of battle and he waved
his new club red now and hairy and at the sight
of his glowing face her tense pose relaxed some-
what and she stood sobbing and rejoicing

  ugh-lomi had a queer unaccountable pang at the
sight of her tears but he only shouted wau the
louder and shook the axe east and west he called
manfully to her to follow him and turned back strid-
ing with the club swinging in his hand towards the
squatting-place as if he had never left the tribe and
she ceased her weeping and followed quickly as a
woman should

  so ugh-lomi and eudena came back to the squat-
ting-place from which they had fled many days be-
fore from the face of uya and by the squatting-
place lay a deer half eaten just as there had been
before ugh-lomi was man or eudena woman so
ugh-lomi sat down to eat and eudena beside him
like a man and the rest of the tribe watched them
from safe hiding-places and after a time one of
the elder girls came back timorously carrying little

si	in her arms and eudena called to them by name
and offered them food but the elder girl was afraid
and would not come though si struggled to come
to eudena afterwards when ugh-lomi had eaten
he sat dozing and at last he slept and slowly the
others came out of the hiding-places and drew near
and when ugh-lomi woke save that there were no
men to be seen it seemed as though he had never
left the tribe

  now there is a thing strange but true that all
through this fight ugh-lomi forgot that he was lame
and was not lame and after he had rested behold
he was a lame man and he remained a lame man to
the end of his days

  cats-skin and the second red-haired man and
wau-hau who chipped flints cunningly as his
father had done before him fled from the face of
ugh-lomi and none knew where they hid but
two days after they came and squatted a good way
off from the knoll among the bracken under the
chestnuts and watched ugh-lomis rage had gone
he moved to go against them and did not and at
sundown they went away that day too they found
the old woman among the ferns where ugh-lomi
had blundered upon her when she had pursued wau-
hau she was dead and more ugly than ever but

ditor of amazing stories

dear sir 

  as a constant reader of amazing
stories i have always been greatly
interested in the various opinions ex-
pressed by your readers regarding the stories which
have been published i have been particularly struck
by the fact that no two seem to agree as to the best
or worst stories or as to the improbability or impos-
sibility of the incidents related personally i always
feel that a story laid in the distant future or on
another planet never seems to carry conviction
rather at the very outset taxes the credulity of the
reader but this is quite apart from the matter
regarding which i am writing to you

  among the many themes which have been criti-
cised and which many of your readers have declared
impossible are those dealing with the elimination of
time or which send the hero if so he may be called
into the future or into the past a short time ago

i	too agreed that it was utterly impossible and had
no scientific foundation and were it not for your
editorials in which you have so often pointed out
that the impossibility of today may become the pos-
sibility of tomorrow and have shown yourself so
liberal and broadminded in your views i would not
now dare to address this communication to you with
the expectation that you would give it the least seri-
ous consideration

  to be brief and to the point not only is it pos-
sible to eliminate time and enter either the past or
the future these things have actually been accom-
plished

  do not think when i make this bold statement
that i am of unsound mind that i am perpetrating
some new hoax or that i am trying to put fiction in
the form of fact on the contrary i am merely
calling to your attention the remarkable and gener-
ally unknown feats of a friend of mine a highly
educated and eminently scientific gentleman who for
several years past has held
the position of instructor
in applied physics in the
second oldest university in
america the univcrsidad
santo tomas at lima

peru

  dr fenomeno menti-
roso is as anyone in peru
can testify a man whose
word and honor cannot be
questioned his works on
the higher mathematics of
physics and his clear and
concise exposition of the
einstein theory which
was first read as a paper
before the fourth pan-
american scientific con-
gress in lima in  are
familiar to every scientist
throughout the world he
would be the last man to attempt to foster a hoax
or to allow his imagination to wander into unproven
fields but he is withal a very modest individual and
dreads more than anything else lest any statement
or declaration he may make should be considered
fictional and his latest exploit is so sensational

and to many persons will appear so utterly impos-
sible that he has absolutely refused to make public
his discoveries or his unparalleled feat moreover
what he has done is as you will see merely a begin-
ning and should full details of his work be made
public his further experiments and inventions might
be greatly hampered still another reason that he
has remained silent is that he expects that his remark-
able invention in its perfected form will ultimately
prove such an irresistible weapon of offense and de-
fence that his country will be forever free from
any fear of hostilities on the part of its traditional
and warlike neighbor the republic of chile

  it was solely because of the numerous allegations
on the part of your readers that time could never
lie eliminated and my insistence that his own ac-
complishment would prove the fallacy of such state-
ments and would at the same time set at rest the
question of a fourth dimension that doctor menti-
roso reluctantly gave me permission to relate the
facts to you

  but as i am no scientist save for the interest i
take in your scientifiction tales and as physics
higher mathematics and fourth dimensional problems
are quite beyond me i shall recount verbatim as
far as possible my conversation with doctor menti-
roso

some twomonths ago during a visit to lima i
had called as i invariably do when in peru upon
doctor mentiroso i bad just received a copy of
amazing stories and somewhat jocularly presented
it to the doctor with the remark that it might give
him some new ideas

  he glanced rather idly over the magazine until his
eye caught a page which instantly aroused his inter-
est and indignation idiots he exclaimed in his
impulsive latin way idiots that people are did
you read this don alfeo then without awaiting
my reply he continued

  will the world never
learn that there is no such
wordas impossible will
people never cease to call
impossible everything
they do not understand
of a truth my good
friend the stupidity of my
fellow men at times makes
me ashamed of the human
race

  what i asked do
you refer to now

  to these letters he
exclaimed pointing to the
paragraphs he had read
to these letters wherein
the writers who obviously
know nothing of the sub-
ject find fault with senor
wells and other authors
stories because they say
there is no fourth dimension and because it is impos-
sible to be in the future or the past coincidently with
ones existence in the present

  i laughed but that obviously is impossible i
replied and as for a fourth dimension-why
amigo rnio how can there be any dimenston other

   tf this story does not bring forth the greatest amount
  of applause from our readers that we have had since
 the magazine started we will be willing to confess that
 we do not know their likings the editor read this story
 three times in succession and will probably read it a
 dozen times before he gets through with it it is one
 of the most remarkable scientifiction stories that we have
 ever inspected tremendous is the one word that will
 do the story justice you will be dizzy and gasping for
 breath before you get through it

   in this story our zvcll-knoivn author delves into the
 mysteries of time and it contains excellent science and
 excellent scientific facts throughout is it possible to
 step into the future is it possible to witness something
 now that happened yesterday and is it possible to
 actually see something that will happen tomorrozv

   the author shows you by giving you obvious proofs
 that all this is not only possible but can apparently be
 done even now

   the big question mark however remains is all this
 possible or is it not but read the story and see for
 yourself


amazing stories

than length breadth and thickness these stories
don fenomeno are merely fiction fiction glossed
with science it is true but pure imagination none
the less you do not understand perhaps that they
are not intended to be taken seriously

  the doctor shrugged his shoulders and regarded
me pityingly fiction i grant he said but fic-
tion only inasmuch as the names of persons and their
particular adventures and feats are concerned the
basic facts in senor wells story and in the others
also are science it is hard to explain to one who is
unfamiliar with the involved theories of the great
einstein of infinity and of electronic forces but a
fourth dimension is as essential to the universe and
to science as is any one of the three recognized
dimensions and if a certain thing is essential to
the universe then most truly my friend that thing
exists

  but i objected if there is a fourth dimension
what is it  and why has no one discovered it 

  it has been discovered declared my friend posi-
tively i doctor fenomeno mentiroso have dis-
covered it and i will try to explain to you what
it is though i doubt if you can grasp it for so
accustomed have men become to think of the exist-
ence of things which do not exist that the ordinary
mind cannot grasp the existence of matters which
they think do not exist

  i threw up my hands in despair its beyond
me i declared if a thing exists which doesnt
exist and things which exist do not exist then we
must all be mad and the whole world must be topsy-
turvy

  on the contrary he continued smiling pity-
ingly at my apparent ignorance it would be mad-
ness not to admit such obvious truths you dream
my friend and as you dream all that occurs is to
your brain real and existent and yet when you
wake you feel convinced that your dreams were
unreal that nothing existed in them and that only
during your waking hours do your senses record
matters which truly exist but suppose if you can
that matters are in reality reversed that your dreams
are actualities and your impressions during waking
hours phantasies or imagine again that both your
dreams and your waking-hour experiences are both
equally real but that during your slumbers you
enter into another sphere into the unknown unex-
plored realm of a fourth dimension what proof
have you that your dreams are not as existent as
your other impressions none my friend not a
shred of proof merely the fact that for generations
we have been taught that dreams were imaginary
figments of the brain it is just as true of count-
less other matters does space exist do length
breath and thickness exist

  of course i interrupted otherwise no object
neither you nor i could exist and geometry and
other mathematics could not exist i-

t ardon me he broke in smiling deprecat-

   ingly but are you quite sure of that a
mathematical line a mathematical plane does not
exist and hence a mathematical cube or parallelo-
gram cannot exist and if we accept senor einsteins
theory two parallel lines will eventually meet the
fact is my friend that we-or most of us at least-
cannot grasp the infinite we are bound down tied

hand and foot to our own petty sphere to this earth
of ours which is an infinitesimal atom in the uni-
verse and we measure everything by earthly stand-
ards and by our own five senses we can conceive
of nothing that we cannot smell taste touch see or
hear no living man can conceive or describe any
form totally unlike anything on earth no man can
conceive or describe a color or a sound unlike any-
thing he has ever seen or heard did you ever think
of that amigo mio and only a comparatively few
men can realize that there is-scientifically speaking
-no such thing as solid matter a few years ago
a thousand things in common use today would have
been scoffed at as impossible even today it is hard
for the average man to understand radio to under-
stand why an airplane flies and it is still harder to
realize that objects which we speak of as solids are
merely the result of combinations of electrons and
protons and it is a thousand times more difficult
for the average man to conceive of everything being
as is unquestionably the case merely the result of
vibratory waves

  hold on i exclaimed you are getting be-
yond me and i cannot see where your highly enter-
taining lecture is leading what has all this to do
with the elimination of space  and how can matter
be composed of waves doctor mentiroso sighed
and shrugged his shoulders expressively

  i forget dear friend that you are an example
of the average man he laughed all that i have
said has a direct bearing on the elimination of space
and the fourth dimension but to answer your last
question we know that light heat sound elec-
tricity radio color smell are all the result of vibra-
tory waves and beyond question there are count-
less thousands of vibratory waves too short or too
long to be received or intercepted by the human
organs heat vibrations are invisible until they are
reduced to a length perceptible to the eye light
vibrations are not detectable by the sense of touch
or feeling until they are lengthened to the point
where they are known as heat only a small per-
centage of sound vibrations are within the range of
the human ear and electro-magnetic vibrations can-
not be detected by any human organ until so altered
as to become sound waves

  i shook my head before you proceed i begged
can you make this a bit clearer you say that heat
vibrations can be made visible that light waves can
be made detectable by touch how 

  if replied don fenomeno speaking slowly and
choosing his words if you heat a bar of iron up to
a certain point it will burn wood or your- skin and
yet you cannot detect its heat by your eyesight but
if heated slightly more it becomes red and you
know it is red hot as you say because you see it
in other words you have gradually decreased the
length of the heat vibrations until they become
visible if the iron is heated still more the red
becomes white or in other words the vibrations have
been shortened until they appear as white light to
your eyes conversely the white or red vibrations
may be lengthened to invisible heat rays by allowing
the metal to cool in other words light waves are
lengthened until they become invisible but recogniz-
able by touch and are considered heat -

  then said i quite pleased with myself accord-
ing to your theory light and heat are identical

  in a way yes replied don mentiroso but in
discoveries of doctor mentiroso



the same way all vibrations are identical for all are
caused merely by the movement of electrons-forc-
ing more electrons into a given space or depriving
some space of its normal number of electrons pos-
sibly your mind cannot conceive the fact but never-
theless every force every power every motion
every body and in fact everything we know-per-
haps our thoughts our senses and our so-called life-
are merely the results of electronic motion

  well even if i grant all this what has it to do
with the original subject of our discussion i
demanded

  everything declared my friend granted that
everything is the result of electronic movement and
you know of course that the electrons are in effect
miniature satellites revolving about a central nucleus
much as the earth and moon revolve about the sun
then we must admit that nothing actual as we know
it exists that everything is merely relative and that
time itself must be the mere expression in arbitrary
terms of some electronic force or vibratory waves

  nonsense i exclaimed i suppose you will be
claiming that time does not exist

t know it does not was his astounding reply

  a it is merely a relative term coined for the
convenience of the human race but permit me to
proceed i will demonstrate this to you presently
you asked about the fourth dimension a moment ago
now let me ask you a question has a circle length
breadth or thickness

  why of- i hesitated certainly i declared
after a moments thought a wheel or a disk has
thickness and its diameter is its breadth

  doctor mentiroso laughed right he agreed
but neither a wheel nor a disk is a circle it is
merely an object or form bounded by a circle what
is the definition of a circle a mathematical plane
with its boundary equidistant from its centre every-
where did not your geometry attempt to solve all
problems by dividing the circle into triangles  and
yet a triangle has three straight boundaries whereas
a circle has no portion of its boundary or circumfer-
ence straight in other words amigo mio as a circle
possesses neither length breadth nor thickness it
must of necessity possess a fourth dimension and
the mathematicians knowing nothing of a fourth
dimension must of necessity fit their geometry to
the occasion and attempt crudely to transform it into
triangles which have length and breadth and yet
circles may be transformed to length or breadth just
as triangles or parallelograms may be transformed
into cubes or pyramids then i laughed you
consider the circle the fourth dimension  not at
all he exclaimed a bit impatiently i am merely
trying to demonstrate to you that a fourth dimension
must exist or otherwise there could be no circles and
consequently no spheres and consequently no revo-
lutions or rotations of electrons atoms stellar bodies
or anything else the earth could not rotate on its
axis it could not follow its orbit about the sun for
none of these things would be possible with the
existence of length breadth and thickness alone with
parallel lines which never meet and with mathemati-
cal planes no my friend the fourth dimension
exists it is ever present it is essential to our lives
to our existence and to our universe but being as
yet inconceivable to us we cannot describe it meas-
ure it or understand it it is in fact beyond our

present senses just as the higher and lower sound
vibrations the shorter and longer light waves and
the radio waves are undetectable by our organs
that is a safe way of putting it i said of
course if we assume that no one can detect it then
no one can be positive that it does not exist but
dont you think all that is negative evidence and
how does it affect the question of time elimination
of going into the past or future while still in the
present which was don fenomeno the original mat-
ter under discussion

  i presume he replied after a moments thought
that you do not consider it possible to enter the
future while still in the present

  i certainly do not i assured him if that were
possible one might foretell with certainty what
would occur tomorrow or a year hence

  precisely he agreed and what if i assure
you that you or i ran foretell what will occur in the
future

  i should think my friend that you were abso-
lutely mad i replied

  don fenomeno arose crossed the room to a table
and returned with a copy of el ticmpo in his hand
glancing over it he pointed to a paragraph and
handed the newspaper to me

  will you be good enough to read that news
item he asked

  nothing remarkable i declared as my eyes
glanced over the indicated paragraph merely the
report of a railway accident in india and the death
of sixteen persons

  quite so agreed doctor fenomeno and
when is the despatch dated

  december th  replied

  and does it state at what hour the accident oc-
curred he asked

  yes i replied reading from the paragraph at
seven p m today the jarabad local train which left
marajpore at    

  enough he interrupted the accident then
occurred at  p m of december th will you
glance at the date at the top of the page and tell me
on what day this copy of el ticmpo was printed 
why on the th of course i replied
exactly he smiled and as you know el
tiempo is on the streets of lima at  a m hence
a paper sold on limas streets at  a m contained
news of a railway accident in india which did not
occur until  p m of the same day in other
words el ticmpo foretold exactly what would oc-
cur in another part of the world thirteen hours
before the event took place and yet he added
shrugging his shoulder you assure me that it is
impossible to enter the future while in the present
but but i expostulated it did not actually
occur thirteen hours later its merely the differ-
ence in time between peru and india it was  p m-
there when  a m here thats not-

pardon my interruption he exclaimed

  a you say that it is merely the difference in
time then you admit that time is merely a relative
term and you were about to state if i am not
mistaken that the fact that the accident was reported
thirteen hours before it occurred did not actually
constitute entering the future ah my friend how
inconsistent you are suppose for the sake of argu-
ment that you or i possessed means of traveling to


amazing stories

or from india instantaneously or even at undreamed
of speed-at a speed which let us say enabled us
to visit india and return in an hour or two in that
case amigo mio had you been in india when the
unfortunate accident occurred you could have flown
here and could have declared-with absolute cer-
tainty-that a railway accident would occur and that
sixteen persons would lose theic lives at  p m even
though you reached lima at  a m and suppos-
ing again that no wireless communication existed
and that in due course of time mail from india con-
firmed your statement would not the public have
declared you a prophet who could foretell the
future 

  i was actually stumped but presently i gathered
my wits together this was i knew utter nonsense
it was all the result of the variation in time due to
the earths rotation on its axis and i felt-that my
friend was merely arguing for the sake of trying to
convince me the impossible was possible by scientific
theory doctor mentiroso listened patiently and
with a half-pitying half-indulgent smile as i ex-
pressed these sentiments

  you are in a way dealing with the pith of the
whole matter he announced when i ceased speak-
ing that is you refer to the variation of time to
the rotation of the earth and by so doing you tacitly
admit that time is actually non-existent that scien-
tifically speaking there is no past no present and no
future for if time as you understand it exists if
the past vanishes and the future is never present
then time would be the same everywhere your so-
called time therefore is merely a relative term used
to describe the motion of the earth in its relation
with the sun in other words human beings have
discovered that our sphere rotates upon its axis and
follows its orbit about the sun and for convenience
mankind has seen fit to divide the rotation and the
orbit into periods which we are pleased to call hours
days months and years but time literally is a far
different matter it is in fact infinite it goes on into
infinity and springs from infinity nothing in na-
ture amigo mio is ever wasted or destroyed al-
though it may alter in form or substance the light
we see here the image which such light throws upon
our brains by the medium of our eyes does not end
here any more than it began here it is merely a
vibratory wave which has travelled millions of miles
and will continue to travel millions trillions of miles
-into infinity in fact-and as it requires an appre-
ciable period for even light to travel every visible
event of the past must be somewhere in that infinity
just as every event of the future must be recorded
somewhere and is travelling toward us to be revealed
when it reaches us in the same way time is but a
vibratory wave a movement of electrons and could
one but follow the path of time at a greater speed
than the vibratory wave travels then most assuredly
could one witness events which transpired a hundred
or a hundred thousand years ago or going in the
other direction he could see events which would not
transpire on earth for thousands of vears to come
i-

  hold on i cried you are merely theorizing
carrying scientific hypotheses to the ultimate degree
and besides even if i admit your preposterous state-
ments to be theoretically sound you are carrying the
whole matter beyond the range of possibilities of
human beings and into space they do not apply to

happenings on earth and hence as i said before it
is impossible for us to enter either the past or the
future

  i thought i had stumped my friend but i was
mistaken

t rlry well he agreed it is hard i admit

  v for the average man to visualize or comprehend
anything beyond the confines of our own planet
so my friend we will confine ourselves to this petty
earth of ours and to prove to you that my state-
ments and theories are sound let me call your atten-
tion to a few facts which with a little reflection you
must recognize as irrefutable the earth you know
revolves from west to east at an approximate speed
of  miles per hour and hence each so-called
hour of time represents approximately one thousand
miles of the earths greatest circumference bear
in mind please that in speaking of these matters
i am referring always to approximate figures-
though if you wish i can give you the exact figures
but to resume granted then that it is according
to the accepted ideas of time noon monday in
lima it will be approximately six p m in london
or barcelona  p m in calcutta and  a m in
hawaii yes i assented roughly speaking
that is so

  very well continued doctor mentiroso sup-
pose for the sake of argument that you are pro-
vided with a machine which can travel through the
air at a speed of  miles per hour and suppos-
ing that in this machine you start eastward from
lima at noon today it is also assumed that you will
set your watch in accord with lima time and will not
alter it until you again arrive at lima at what
time would you reach barcelona

  i did a bit of mental calculation and replied con-
fidently at  p m don fenomeno laughed
heartily oh my dear friend he exclaimed
wrong at the very start you forget that at the
moment you left lima it was noon and hence  p m
in spain and as you have supposedly consumed
six hours in reaching your destination it will be 
p m when you arrive there although your watch
will tell you that it is but  p m so you have
already traveled six hours into the future very
well suppose you leave at once for calcutta at
what hour will you arrive at that indian city 

  this time i was a bit more careful and after a
moments hesitation replied at noon on tuesday

  exactly-according to calcuttas clocks as-
sented my friend but suppose you glance at your
watch you will find that it is only  p m on
monday so that you have now entered twelve hours
into the future but continue eastward and head for
hawaii reaching that delightful spot what time
do you find it is

  rapidly figuring with a pencil on a scrap of paper
i gave my answer approximately  p m
monday

  and according to your watch  a m tuesday
chuckled the doctor in other words you find
hawaiis time precisely the same as was calcuttas
six hours before while you have traveled back from
the future six hours towards the present and con-
tinuing your mad flight to lima you will discover
that you complete your journey around the earth at
noon on tuesday-twenty-four hours after leaving
and remarkable as it may seem your watchand the
discoveries of doctor mentiroso



clocks in lima agree on the hour by some myste-
rious means you have come back to the present after
entering the future to the extent of twelve hours
but i objected you forget that in crossing the
approximate th degree of longitude in the pacific
a day is added or subtracted according to whether
one is traveling east or west

  quite true agreed the doctor but supposing
you had done so then when you arrived in lima it
would have been a day later whereas it would of
necessity-considering that you circumnavigated the
earth in twenty-four hours--be the same day and
to further prove the fallacy of your argument sup-
pose you start from lima in a westerly direction
stopping at the same
points as before in
that case amifo mio
be good enough to tell
me at what hour and
on what day you would
arrive at hawaii 

that is easy i de-
clared  i would ar-
rive at honolulu at
approximately  p m
on monday

 by your own
watch yes chuckled
my friend but at
noon on monday ac-
cording to the time in
the hawaiian islands

in other words you
might truthfully be
said to have traveled
from lima to hono-
 u  u instantaneously

but if you continue
on your westward
flight at what hour
b y calcutta time
would you arrvie at
that town

  i suppose theres a
catch in it i replied

and i confess im
getting so confound-
edly confused that i
might as well guess at
it i should say at 
a m tuesday

  doctor mentiroso
laughed good natured-
ly no my friend
he announced it
would be at noon on
tuesday for during
the twelve hours which
have passed since you
left lima twelve
hours have also passed
in calcutta although
your own timepiece
would indicate that it
was  p m on mon-
day so you would again be  hours in the future
but continuing on your way you would find on arriv-
ing at barcelona that it was still noon on monday al-
though  a m tuesday by your watch so that you

had leaped from twelve hours into the future and
were now back six hours towards the present con-
tinuing onwards you would reach lima at  noon
on tuesday your watch would indicate noon on
tuesday and you would suddenly discover that you
had been in three places separated one from the
other by nearly six thousand miles at precisely the
same hour

i threw up my hands in despair i know you
are juggling figures i declared but ill be
hanged if i see where it comes in i suppose you
still have something up your sleeve well fire away
ill be the goat

   don fenomeno nod-
ded and smiled then
let us assume that
your purely imaginary
aircraft is capable of
traveling at the rate of
 miles per hour
or that in an hours
time you can circum-
navigate the earth in
that case starting
from lima at noon on
monday and rushing
eastward you would
arrive in barcelona at

	p m on mon-
day though your
watch would show it
to be  p m
you would reach cal-
cutta at  a m tues-
day although still only

	on monday by
your watch at ha-
waii you would find
time had leaped back
to  a m mon-
day despite the fact
that your watch
showed  of the
same day and at  p
m on monday by
your watch you would
be back in lima where
the clocks would prove
to you that it was 
p m despite the fact
that you had been ab-
sent only one hour

   and what marvel-
lous thing would occur
should i reverse my
flight and travel west-
ward i asked

   in that case he
replied you would be
at honolulu at 
monday by your
watch but at  a
m by the local clocks
at calcutta you would
find the inhabitants soundly sleeping at  a m
tuesday although by your own time it would be
barely half an hour after noon on monday at
barcelona the working people would be going home

amazing stories

from their labors at  p m on monday despite
your watch telling you that it was  and you
would get back to lima at  p m on monday to
find that your watch agreed with limas time and
now if you are not being bored let me give you a
still more striking illustration of the purely imagi-
nary and relative status of what we ordinarily call
time if when in your  mile per hour craft
you set your watch in accord with the local time at
each point of call it would work out thus when going
east leaving lima at noon on monday you reach
barcelona at  p m monday and setting your
watch to agree you proceed to calcutta where you
arrive at  a m on tuesday to find your watch
indicates  p m monday again altering your
watch and heading for hawaii you arrive there at

	a m monday regardless of the fact that your
watch says  a m tuesday and having read-
justed the latter you proceed and reach lima at
 p m monday and find your watch is at 
a m monday thus you will have been in the
future over six hours at barcelona and over eleven
hours in calcutta but you will have been into the
past eighteen hours in hawaii and back in lima
five and one-half hours before you left this city

  that i ejaculated is ridiculously impossible

  but nevertheless true declared don fenomeno
moreover should you follow out the same system
and travel west you would return to lima to find
that according to your watch you had consumed six
hours on your journey although you knew you had
been away only one hour its all bosh i de-
clared its like proving black is white or that a cat
has three tails by mathematical formulae anyhow
its impossible for it is impossible to travel one
thousand miles per hour much less twenty-four
thousand

  my peruvian friend raised his dark eyebrows and
shrugged be very sure my good friend how you
use the word impossible he advised me do not
forget that twenty years ago anyone would have
declared it impossible for man to fly in air at over
one hundred miles per hour and that scarcely longer
ago it would have been deemed equally impossible
to construct a motor car which would reach a speed
of fifty miles an hour not to mention one hundred
miles and more but before challenging your state-
ment let me for the sake of clarity give you a brief
summary of the examples i have been drawing for
your edification your watch as you have seen if
kept at lima time would be constantly in the pres-
ent speaking approximately and regarding for our
purpose the space of one hour as present and yet
you would have been at spots where yesterdays
events were occurring and at others where tomorrows
happenings were taking place and this my friend
is important provided the speed of the machine in
which you travel could be accelerated so as to travel
faster than light you could go backward or forward
into the past or present or into the fourth dimension
moreover as the human eye is incapable of register-
ing the alternating effects of darkness and light at a
speed greater than about  per second as exempli-
fied in the cinema if you were passing rapidly
enough about the earth you could see no difference
between light and darkness could not realize time
and would appear to remain stationary and with time
non-existent and at the same time you would be
quite invisible to the eyes of any human beings

but even if your speed were not greater than the
moderate speed of  miles per hour you would
of necessity go farther and farther into the past and
future at every lap about the earth until-

mderate speed  interrupted i like

  ivx your idea of speed why at that speed any
machine would become incandescent through friction
and would be transformed to gas and ashes now
dont try to kid me into-

  dont think for a moment i am endeavoring to
kid you as you call it said doctor mentiroso in
injured tones nothing is farther from my
thoughts i started out to convince you that the
elimination of time was not impossible and that a
fourth dimension exists and has been discovered by
me doctor fenomeno mentiroso your most humble
servant and very good friend i admit that under
ordinary conditions a machine traveling at such high
speeds as i mentioned would become heated to the
incandescent point but such a result would be due
entirely to the friction of the air suppose then that
the machine should travel beyond the atmospheric
envelope of the earth or that means could be found
for eliminating air friction in that case you must
admit there would be no fear of heating

  you can suppose anything i replied but sup-
positions are not actualities and no one will ever be
able to travel through space or overcome air friction
that at least you must admit is impossible on
the contrary declared don fenomeno i insist that
it is not only possible but that it actually has been
accomplished

  i gazed at my friend in incredulous amazement
had doctor mentiroso taken leave of his senses
or was he merely trying to lead me on for the sake 
of argument unquestionably i decided it must be
the latter for my friend was obviously as sane as
ever and was smiling at me in such a supercilious
or rather i might say triumphant manner that i was
quite sure he had something up his sleeve

  perhaps i suggested with a laugh you mean
it has been accomplished theoretically and by the
way did i not understand you to say that you had
discovered the fourth dimension lets hear about
that

  you understood correctly amigo mio replied
don fenomeno i have discovered the fourth di-
mension and instead of accomplishing the feat of
overcoming friction on a rapidly moving body on
paper i have accomplished it in fact moreover
the two discoveries are closely correlated or shall
i say dependent one upon the other had i not
discovered the secret of the fourth dimension i
could not have accomplished the even greater feat
and paradoxical as it may seem had i not accom-
plished the latter i would not have discovered the
secret of the fourth dimension

  i suppose i remarked sarcastically that you
will now inform me in all seriousness that you actu-
ally have constructed an apparatus capable of travel-
ing one thousand miles an hour or more

  decidedly more was his calm response to be
exact very nearly ten thousand miles an hour
and-

  youre absolutely mad my friend  i exclaimed
but go on one must humor the insane next i
presume you will assure me that you have flown in
your dream machine perhaps have even circum-
discoveries of doctor mentiroso



navigated the world and have thus proved the pos-
sibility of entering the future

  i shall begin to believe in mental telepathy if
you continue he laughed your presumptions are
extraordinarily correct i have flown-or rather
traveled in my dream machine as you see fit to call
it and i have circumnavigated the world at a speed
nearly eleven times the speed of the earths rota-
tion i-

  wait a bit i cried now convinced that my
friend had taken leave of his senses but anxious to
see how far he had gone you spoke of your ap-
paratus traveling ten thousand miles an hour and
now you tell me you have traveled around the earth
eleven times faster than the globe rotates on its axis
i dont get that

  i forgot to mention he explained that the dis-
covery of the principle of the fourth dimension also
included the elimination of gravitational attraction
as it is commonly called and as i have already told
you that my discoveries do away with atmospheric
friction you will at once understand that a machine
traveling at an initial velocity of ten thousand miles
an hour and free from atmospheric friction and
gravitational pull will when headed eastward travel
at that speed plus the speed of the earths rotation
or approximately  miles per hour i think-
very good i agreed still determined to humor
him but if there is no attraction of gravitation why
did you not fly off into space 

  the fourth dimension again he answered it
will of course be difficult for you to understand
but ill try to explain it in terms which are familiar
to you and i see that you think i am crazy im
not surprised my friend but as a matter of fact i
was never saner i think before i am through that
you will realize this but to reply to your most
natural query if for example you jump into the
air you temporarily overcome gravitation through
the use of muscular power which is greater than the
force of gravity on your body but you can only
jump so far in other words your limit is one of
the three recognized dimensions if you jump longi-
tudinally the same thing occurs for your leap is
limited by length and here let me call your attention
to a very ordinary but hitherto entirely overlooked
matter which is of the utmost importance when
you leap upward you return to your original posi-
tion or to the earth in an approximately straight
line but when you leap longitudinally you travel
from start to finish in a curved line although so
far as i am aware this phenomenon has never at-
tracted much attention it is an indication of the
existence of the fourth dimension but i am di-
gressing just as your recognized three dimensions
measure your jump perpendicularly or horizontally
so the fourth dimension regulates or controls the
distance my apparatus can move against gravitational
pull perhaps it might be better to say that the gravi-
tational pull controls the fourth dimension

  another point i insisted if you over-
a come air friction how do you propel your
machine  i may be a layman but i fail to see how
any apparatus can be propelled without friction i
have always understood that it was frictional resist-
ence which propelled an airplane

  usually it is he replied but in the present
case no my apparatus embodies an entirely new

principle i am very sorry but i scarcely like to
divulge it at present and he added with a laugh
you probably wouldnt be any the wiser for the
explanation

  i might if i could see it i suggested

  possibly he repeated with an odd smile but
we will leave that until later as i remarked it is
difficult for me to convey an adequate idea of my
apparatus but i will do my best relieved of what is
known as the attraction of gravitation the machine
of course rises or is thrown violently upward from
the earth its upward flight controlled by the use of
the fourth dimension which for reasons i will ex-
plain i have called esnesnon being free from air
friction as i have already said it remains stationary
while the earth and its envelope of atmosphere whirls
from east to west at  miles per hour the result
being the same as if the apparatus were traveling
eastward at  miles per hour

  but you stated that your machine traveled at a
speed of  miles per hour i objected

  so it does he declared as calmly as though
speaking of fifty or one hundred miles an hour
and that speed added to the speed of the earths
rotation equals the  miles i referred to but
my good friend i have already told you that  how
many times must i repeat such simple matters
they may appear simple to ycu i said and you
may be sane as you say but to me the mere thought
of such speed is too staggering to believe and i
still fail to see how you propel your machine when
as you claim you eliminate air friction or pressure or
whatever you may call it

  i was coming to that very point when you inter-
rupted me he replied a bit impatiently as i said
the earths atmospheric envelope is sweeping past the
apparatus at a speed of  miles per hour in
other words the apparatus stands isolated in the
centre of a one thousand miles per hour hurricane
is that clear

  perfectly clear i assured him

  very well he continued now let me ask you
a question did you ever hear of the so-called rotor-
ship a vessel invented and constructed a few years
ago by a german

  certainly i replied the vessel as i recall it
was provided with large cylindrical masts or towers
which were revolved at high speed the idea being
that wind impinging on a rotating surface produces
a vacuum and forces the rotating surface forward
but the rotor ship i believe proved a complete
failure anyhow what has that to do with your
discoveries 

  nothing directly he said i was merely seek-
ing some familiar thing which i could use as a com-
parison to enable you to grasp the basic principles of
my apparatus and i might add that the rotor-ship
was not a failure from a mechanical or scientific
point of view but was merely commercially imprac-
tical owing to various factors which in no way affect
its principle but to continue if when within the
mass of air moving at  miles an hour a portion
of that force of air were permitted to strike upon a
revolving surface my apparatus would rush forward
exactly as the rotor-vessel was propelled only im-
measurably faster

  i can understand that i admitted but it cer-
tainly would not move forward at  miles an


amazing stories

hour when the speed of the air was only  miles
an hour moreover what means could you employ
to prevent the air friction if you used that friction
for your propelling force  it seems to me my friend
that you are contradicting yourself

  again don fenomeno smiled that superior and
condescending smile suppose the entire frictional
force were exhausted in propelling the machine he
observed and by rotating the rotors as we may
call them rapidly enough to absorb all the friction
and by allowing the friction of the air to act upon
certain properly designed surfaces elsewhere the ap-
paratus would and actually did travel at the speed
i have mentioned although i admit i employ the
gravitational pull as an auxiliary force just as an
airplane rises and moves forward because of the angle
of incidence upon its planes so by utilizing the
gravitational force which would tend to draw my
machine to earth and then by special apparatus pre-
venting it from descending i would achieve a similar
result and force the machine forward

  but tell me i broke in now thoroughly inter-
ested and quite oblivious of the seeming impossibil-
ities he was describing tell me what power you
use to accomplish these marvels and what is this
fourth dimension or esnesnon as you call it

  ill answer your last question first he replied
although as a matter of fact i cannot exactly ex-
plain what esnesnon is myself

  i laughed you say youve discovered something
you cannot describe i exclaimed come now
don fenomeno arent you trying to see how far
you can spoof me as the british say

octor mentiroso flushed if it were
not for the fact that you are a very old and
dear friend of mine and inexpressibly stupid i
should take offense at that remark and should refuse
to say another word he declared but under the
circumstances amigo mio and knowing that you are
really most simpatico and that it is most difficult to
convince one of anything quite new and revolu-
tionary i shall with patience control myself and will
do my little best to convince you that i am serious
and at the same time make clear to your uncom-
prehending mind exactly what i have done and how
it has been accomplished you say i contradict my-
self my friend you no doubt admit the existence
of oxygen of hydrogen of nitrogen of electricity
of radio waves and of numerous other things which
the world accepts and uses in every walk of life
you admit unquestionably that the entire life of
our planet if not other planets as well the existence
of the universe in fact depends upon the gases i
have mentioned but can you or any other man de-
scribe them  can you give a clear definition of what
oxygen for example is like have you or has
anyone else ever seen it and yet it has been dis-
covered it is in daily hourly use it iscombined
isolated confined and in combination with other
materials it assumes tangible forms the same is
true of electricity of radio waves of countless other
things i might mention esnesnon is much the
same it is invisible intangible indescribable and
yet without it the universe could not exist and like
many other things it can be isolated utilized and
combined with other things

  hmm there may be something in that i ad-
mitted you say the esnesnon is not a force but a

dimension what then is the power or force you em-
ploy to achieve your amazing results 

  the greatest force or power in the entire uni-
verse declared don fenomeno the force which
for want of a better term is known as the attraction
of gravitation the force which holds the planets to
their orbits the earth to its rotation the spheres in
place and prevents you and me and the world about
us from being transformed into attenuated gaseous
matter

  i shook my head in despair youre getting be-
yond me again i expostulated ive always un-
derstood that the attraction of gravitation is down-
ward or towards the centre of the earth in that
case i cant see how you can utilize the power ex-
cept for coming down

  of course the pull is downward or rather to-
wards the centre of the earth-or towards the actual
mass of any object he exclaimed every body has
its gravitational force which is exerted upon other
bodies but please understand my friend that the
so-called attraction of gravitation is an electronic
force and not a magnetic force as far as your
other question is concerned may i call your atten-
tion to the fact that the force of water is also down-
ward you never saw a waterfall flow upward and
yet as you know water power may be utilized for
innumerable purposes and to produce force for driv-
ing mechanisms in every direction the same is
true of the force of gravitation once its mysteries
are mastered it may be used as freely as water
steam electricity or any other force and being the
supreme force of all forces and the source of all
its power properly directed is millions of times
greater than any other known power

  but how on earth did you happen to discover all
this  i demanded at last convinced that doctor
mentiroso had actually accomplished seemingly im-
possible feat beyond my wildest dreams

  in a way he replied i cannot claim to have
discovered these things i have rediscovered them
they have been known for centuries-perhaps thou-
sands of years no do not look so skeptical amigo

i	am speaking the unvarnished truth and will ex-
plain as you know far more inca than spanish
blood flows in my veins and for long i have devoted
much time to studying the history and remains of
my ancestors the stupendous works of the pre-
incas in particular have always been a source of
marvel and wonder to me as to yourself and to
countless thousands of other men feats which they
performed seem almost supernatural as you know
the massive walls about cuzco and lake titicaca
walls composed of stupendous blocks weighing scores
of tons blocks of twenty to thirty or more faces
and each so perfectly cut and so accurately fitted
that even today a pen-point cannot be inserted be-
tween the stones the cyclopean monuments and
buildings the tunnels cut through many feet of liv-
ing rock the enormous fortresses the marvellous
metal work all these facts performed by the long-
dead race have puzzled every archeologist and no one
has hitherto been able to explain by what unknown
means they were accomplished but to me and now
that i am about to divulge it to you the secret is
known at last all these great feats my friend were
simple matters to my ancestors for they of all- men
had discovered the fourth dimension and the key to
utilizing the forces of gravitation two years ago
discoveries of doctor mentiroso



in the unknown and unexplored territory east of
lake titicaca i learned of a ruined city from the
indians there i went and found hidden in the
forest the ruins of a pre-lncan city of vast extent
in all peru no other such ruin had ever been found
no other had remained so well preserved for the
spanish conquerors had never reached it and it had
remained unmolested and free from looting and
vandalism for hundreds perhaps thousands of years

tere i set up my camp and for days studied

  ll	the countless carvings and inscriptions that
covered walls columns and monuments here for
the first time i found hieroglyphs that seemed to me
possible of interpretation but i could make little
of them familiar as i was with the language of the
incas at last luck or fortune or perhaps the
spirits of my ancestors favored me an earthquake
rent the ground and threw down a massive piece of
wall to disclose a hidden chamber wherein were
stored priceless records of the race who once had
dwelt there and who as i soon learned were the
highest caste of the mysterious pre-lncan people

  here too and most wonderful of all was the
key to the glypths besides countless strange instru-
ments and utensils wonderful works in copper
bronze and gold plans of the monuments the for-
tresses and the walls which exist throughout peru
today and here as franctically fascinated i studied
the glyphs and records i learned that my ancestors
fully twenty centuries before the coming of pizarro
had mastered the secrets of the fourth dimension and
of gravitational force and had harnessed them and
by their aid had accomplished the seeming miracles
of cyclopean work which we wonder at today it
would be of little interest and would be a long story
to tell you all the details of my discovery amigo mio
but to me a descendant of that strange highly civil-
ized but forgotten race was given the fortune to
learn the secrets and laws of nature which centuries
ago had been discovered and centuries later had
been lost through wanton destruction of a nation
and herein my friend my ancestors failed all they
had learned they had applied to peaceful arts never
did it occur to them that the tremendous the ir-
resistible forces they alone knew could lie used
against their enemies that no beings could resist
them but i i don fenomeno mentiroso senor i
am not so blind with the powers and forces i have
rediscovered from the records of my ancestors i
have within my grasp that which will place my coun-
try forever beyond fear of conquest or of war the
united powers of the world might attempt to subdue
or to humble peru but they would be as powerless
as so many buzzing flies their navies could be de-
stroyed their armies wiped out their artillery ren-
dered useless their aircraft annihilated as fast as
they could be assembled this could be done by means
with which they could not cope it is for - that
reason that i will never divulge my secrets but do
not think that i fail to realize the importance of my
discovery to the arts of peace but greater to me is
the importance of my accomplishments as a safe-
guard to my country i   

  yes yes i interrupted seeing that my tem-
peramental and patriotic friend was rapidly working
himself into a fervor and latin-like would continue
his oratorical talk indefinitely yes don fenom-

eno my good friend i can clearly see your point
it is indescribably noble of you and worthy of a
son of the incas but let us leave this side of the
matter for the present and confine ourselves to a
further consideration of the scientific and practical
side of your most marvellous discoveries

  most certainly he exclaimed pardon me for
so far digressing from the theme let me see i was
telling you of the power i employ and you asked
how i happened to discover it now---

  you have explained that i reminded him and
while i do not fully grasp all the technicalities of
your twin discoveries or of your apparatus i think
i understand the principles although i admit the
whole affair is so absolutely astounding as to seem
incredible and i freely admit that were anyone but
yourself to make such statements i should unhesitat-
ingly put him down as worthy rival of baron
miinchhausen

  my friend rose and bowed thank you a thou-
sand thanks to you amigo for the implied compli-
ment he laughed

  but there is another question i continued did
i understand you to say that you actually had
traveled around the earth on your or in your secret
apparatus 

  you did and i have he assured me not once
but several times and each time my observations and
records proved conclusively that my deductions and
calculations were sound and correct and that with
the proper means at my command i can go into the
future or the past and can eliminate time as you
call it strictly speaking of course time is but a
relative term a mere arbitrary word whereas actual
time is a wave governed and controlled by the
esnesnon and is no more like your arbitrary con-
ception of time and bears no more relation to it than
oxygen does to water or nitrogen bears to nitrate
of potassium in other words my friend your so-
called time is governed by the esnesnon while the
true time and by that i mean the phase of the vibra-
tory time wave is not in any way affected by your
conception of time is that clear

  about as clear as mud i grinned but if you
have traveled about the earth at  miles an hour
how in the world could you see or observe anything
while moving at that rate of speed

h my poor friend he exclaimed pityingly

  vycan you not grasp the fundamental truth
that all things are relative to you a speed is great
or small merely by comparison with your much
slower motions and surroundings were you dropped
from a thousand foot precipice you would see noth-
ing but a blurr as you hurtled earthward but the
condor or the eagle dropping for thousands of
feet and at terrific speed sees the smallest bird or
animal and strikes it unerringly and so in an
apparatus wherein your cloying arbitrary time is
non-existent and surrounded and controlled by the
fourth dimension a speed which to you would seem
incomprehensibly swift seems merely a slow and
steady jog to me indeed though perhaps you will
not believe it my circumnavigation of the earth ap-
pears to me at the time to be no shorter than when
several years ago i went around the world in one
of the dollar line steamships not until i return
and step from the fourth dimensional machine into


amazing stories

the humdrum present do i realize that the journey
has consumed only an hour or two now if only
you too-

  nothing doing i announced positively before
he could complete his sentence ill leave it to you
but tell me when did you make your last trip

  don fenomeno glanced at his watch by your
time i returned to lima at  pm yesterday he
replied as casually as though referring to a motor
ride of a few miles

  and at what hour did you start on this wondrous
trip i asked

  he laughed at midnight last night was his
amazing reply

  what i gasped what nonsense is this you
say-

  he raised his hand and checked me have you
forgotten so soon all the examples i gave you he
asked do you not remember that i pointed out
that if you should travel eastward at a speed greater
than the rotation of the earth you would be back
in lima before you started for example i am
planning another trip today and as i travel at a rate
of approximately  miles per hour and start
at eleven thirty-precisely one hour from now-
i will of necessity be back this morning at  the
slight difference in figures between my example and
the actuality being due to the fact that my route does
not precisely follow the equatorial circumference of
the earth

  i sank back in my chair and rail my hands through
my hair its all the dreamiest weirdest hodge-
podge the most involved and incomprehensible thing
i ever heard i cried why man alive if im
hearing aright and youre serious then in an hour
youll start off and this morning at seven-thirty youll
be back and ill be here at nine and youll tell
me all this damned nonsense over again and start
again and    why confound it all if thats true
to-dayll go on forever or    good heavens it
makes my head reel to think about it

  doctor mentiroso laughed heartily my dear
good friend  he exclaimed do not be so perturbed
about it you forget that you are talking and think-
ing of arbitrary time whereas i am referring to
fourth dimensional or real time no my friend
though by your time i may set forth at half after
eleven today and return this morning at seven thirty
yet by actual time i set out and returned at precisely
the same moment of your time no-be patient a
moment for there are many puzzling features of the
matter some of which i confess i have not fully
mastered myself as yet but it is obvious amigo
mio that did i actually arrive at seven thirty this
morning from a trip on which i am to start out
four hours after i arrive then i certainly could not
be present in the interim but i propose my friend
that you witness a most interesting experiment which
if i am not mistaken will convince you of the
soundness of my statements you can be of great
help to me then

t  gladly do anything within reason to help you

   i assured him still a bit dazed at the night-
marish problems his words had started in my mind
but ill do nothing rash and i will not try any
stunts in that mad machine of yours for that mat-

ter im beginning to think its all bosh and you have
no such machine

  ill soon convince you of that he declared but
what i am about to ask of you is neither rash nor
risky i would merely like to have you witness my
departure and return and check up on the phenomena
if as you and others claim your so-called time really
exists then beyond question i cannot encircle the
globe-no matter how fast i travel and yet be back
hours before i set forth or even instantaneously on
the other hand if i am right and your time is a ridi-
culous nonsensical and childish thing with no basis
and true time is entirely distinct then i will of a
certainty be back before i start or at least at the
same moment are you willing amigo mio to try
the test

  gladly i declared  come show me your

-mile-an-hour machine and hop off for a trip
around the earth and ill wait and time you you
cant keep up this joke much longer old man

  once again don fenomeno smiled in his oddly
superior way and rose from his chair very well
my good friend he remarked i think within a
few moments you are due to have a rather astound-
ing surprise

  he led the way through a heavily barred and pad-
locked door to a large windovvless room or rather
i might say an open court enclosed by high massive
walls in the centre and resting on a sort of pedestal
of black stone was an elliptical or egg-shaped contri-
vance of a peculiar bluish color reminding me of
blued steel and about thirty feet in length by eight
or ten feet in diameter i regret that i cannot give
a detailed description of the thing for one of the
conditions on which doctor mentiroso insisted be-
fore granting me permission to make public his dis-
coveries was that i should omit all detailed descrip-
tions of his apparatus or its mechanism i may state
however that the exterior of the machine was cov-
ered with spiral flanges or bands so that it had
somewhat the appearance of a gigantic screw that
several pyramidal or mushroom-shaped projections
broke its surface and that it had no wings or planes
like an airship

  this announced my friend is the machine
which i referred to

  it appears to be a machine all right i admitted
but it certainly does not appear capable of rising
or of progressing and even more certainly not at
any such speed as you claim for it

  don fenomeno laughed appearances he re-
minded me are often very deceptive but as you
say in english the proof of the pudding is in the
eating in a few moments my friend you will
change your mind and let me forewarn you you
may witness some rather disconcerting events but
you need not be either surprised or alarmed at any-
thing which may transpire it now lacks but three
minutes of the time for my departure will you
amigo mio stand here and time me in my flight
around the earth 

  gladly i replied provided your flight does not
consume too much time for i have not eaten lunch
as yet and if you are not back within an hour or two
-and i havent the least expectation that you will be
-i warn you that my appetite will overcome my
curiosity and i shall go out to eat

  you will not have to go hungry long he de-
discoveries of doctor mentiroso



clared even if you are right it will be a short time
before i return

  that is if you go or return at all i said but
let us get this clear you claim youll return before
you start or at the same time which i claim is mani-
festly impossible i claim that granting theres no
fake to all this and that by some incredible means
you can fly around the earth in that contraption at
the speed you state youll be back here in approxi-
mately two hours am i right

  absolutely he agreed while he approached the
mechanism and stopped to examine some knobs and
dials on the black rock pedestal would you mind
he asked standing about here youll be better able
to witness some of the phenomena which may take
place he indicated a step leading to the pedestal
it was as he said a fine point of vantage and
anxious to make sure that there was no trickery
about the matter despite my faith in don fenomeno
i took my place as he suggested smiling my friend
then stepped to his machine climbed upon it and
opening a sliding panel stepped within dont leave
until im back he cautioned me as with only his
head visible he prepared to close the door its im-
portant for you to remain exactly where you are
you see he added as if in explanation i cannot be
a witness of the phenomena and i want you to tell me
about everything that takes place now take out
your watch and time me for ill be off in a jiffy

as he spoke he ducked into his machine and
 drew the panel shut wondering what if any-
thing would happen next i glanced at my watch and
found it precisely eleven thirty as i did so there
was a strange roar from the machine before me a
sudden wind seemed to sweep with terrific force
across the courtyard i swayed on my feet my head
swam dizzily i had the impression of being hurled
over and over and then as suddenly as it had begun
the noise ceased the air was calm and still and my
head cleared i glanced at the pedestal and stared
with unbelieving eyes the egg-shaped apparatus
had vanished  it was true then my friend had ac-
tually taken flight in his strange machine un-
doubtedly that explained the rush of air and my sen-
sations for assuredly a mass of that size could not
have hurtled upward at over ten thousand miles an
hour without creating a terrific vortex in its wake
hardly had these thoughts rushed through my brain
when once more the blast of a hurricane roared about
me i clung for dear life to the stone pedestal for
a brief second i seemed to lose consciousness and
as before the wind ceased my brain cleared and as
i raised myself from my recumbent position i al-
most cried out in amazement before me and resting
within six feet of where i stood was the bluish
ovoid thing into which doctor mentiroso had van-
ished it was incredible that he could have gone far
in the few brief seconds which had elapsed no
doubt i thought he had had trouble or had re-
turned for some other reason and i momentarily ex-
pected to see him emerge from the thing so great
had been my excitement and confusion that i had
completely forgotten to look at my watch a glance
showed me however that less than one minute had
elapsed

  the next second the slide in the machine opened
don fenomenos head appeared and as i stared at

him he sprang from the machine as he did so a
sudden wave of darkness seemed to envelop me i
had the terrifying sensation of having gone blind
and with a sharp cry i put my hands to my eyes
instantly it was full sunlight once more my friends
laugh sounded in my ears and i looked up to find
him standing beside me with a triumphant smile on
his face

  well what think you now amigo mio he ex-
claimed

  i think im mad i replied do you mean to
tell me-

  that i have again circumnavigated the old
earth he chuckled i certainly do my friend
but what time did i return 

  at eleven thirty-one if you actually did re-
turn i replied

  and will you kindly glance at my watch he
asked

  great scott i ejaculated yours says 

  assuredly was his calm response i returned
from my little jaunt approximately six minutes ago
or at  am in other words four hours before
i started and we are now conversing easily although
i am in the past four hours while you are in the
present or else i am in the present and you are four
hours in the future

  i sank limply upon a settee if you keep this up
ill be hopelessly mad if im not already i gasped
its all too involved for me and i believe its some
devilish hallucination anyhow

  did you not see me start and return  he asked

  the lord knows i cried one instant your
contraption was gone the next instant it was back
i was nearly blown away by a cyclone i seemed to
be whirled topsy-turvey ive been temporarily blind
and i know its absolutely preposterous for you to
claim that you flew around the earth in one minute

  less than that he corrected me you were a
trifle confused i expect and forgot to look at your
watch the moment i arrived i might add that for
a moment or two you were partially in the fourth
dimension you inadvertently stepped away from
the spot where i posted you its a bit lucky you
didnt go farther or i might have had trouble in
getting you back

  i was too stunned and nonplussed to speak it was
all too thoroughly ridiculous and impossible some-
how i was sure that my friend had gone hurtling
through space and yet i could not credit it and i
could not account for my peculiar sensations or why
his watch should have leaped back four hours still
his explanation could not i felt be true

ook here don fenomeno i exclaimed at

  j-j last its utterly preposterous for you to
claim you have traveled twenty-four thousand miles
in one minute or less especially when you yourself
claim only eleven thousand miles an hour for your
machine that would mean over two hours at the
best

  but my dear sir he replied you forget that
you are talking arbitrary time according to that
time absolutely no appreciable period elapsed be-
tween my start and my return whereas if you wish
to argue along the lines of true time i might point
out that i encircled the globe in four hours less than
nothing of your time


amazing stories

  but i dont admit that you have proved you en-
circled the globe i persisted

  then you are still unconvinced laughed don
fenomeno it s i think fortunate that i possess
the patience and determination of my indian an-
cestors or i should despair of convincing you but
i have an idea certainly if i actually passed
through the places i have mentioned then i should
have knowledge of events transpiring there let
me see ah i have it when in barcelona the most
notable occurrence was the tragic death of a famous
bullfighter a matador known as manuelito who was
killed by an infuriated bull in the arena that was
let me see at approximately  pm today and as i
passed through calcutta a fire was raging on the
docks and had spread to vessels moored there that
would have been at about  tonight

  i laughed of course you can say that i re-
plied but how can you prove that such occurrences
took place

  easily enough he responded we will hurry
to the cable office and see what foreign news has ar-
rived and if my statements are verified i am sure
that even such a doubting thomas as you my friend
will be convinced most assuredly you must admit
that unless i had actually been at barcelona and cal-
cutta i could not have known what was taking place
there

  in a few moments we reached the office of the
all america cables to find a boy just attaching the
latest cabled news to the bulletin board and as i read
the heading of the uppermost sheet my head fairly
reeled and i stood gaping in astonishment there
unmistakably was the announcement that as the
final bull of the afternoon was about to be killed by
the favorite matador manuelito the man had slipped
on a pool of blood and had instantly been charged
and gored by the infuriated bull

  doctor mentirosos self-satisfied chuckle brought
me to my senses

  ah he exclaimed so you do believe i was in
barcelona this evening if i am not mistaken my
statement regarding calcutta will also be verified in
a moment here comes the boy with another sheet
this time i was scarcely surprised as i read the
outstanding news on the latest bulletin for i had al-
most expected it but as i read the account of the
disastrous dock fire in calcutta i had the strange
sensation of being in a dream

  i admit it now i muttered as i turned away
but i still feel that the thing is impossible and that
it must all be a dream but man if you really can
do these things you will be the most famous and the
richest man on earth why there is no limit to what
you may accomplish think what it will mean to
commerce to civilization to linking the nations of
the world together

  doctor mentiroso shook his head and smiled sadly
i realize all of this he said with a sigh but it is
not for me to profit by my discovery as i said be-
fore i shall keep the matter a secret a secret known
only to you and to myself and to be used solely for
my own scientific investigations and if my beloved
country should be threatened by a foe it can be
used as a means of national defense

  but you are robbing mankind of the most
astounding and revolutionary discoveries ever made
i protested surely you could manage to keep the

details the processes of your inventions secret so
that perus enemies could not construct similar ma-
chines

  that would be impossible he declared did
you ever know of any national secret being kept from
an enemy no amigo mio only by keeping what i
know locked in my own brain can i hope to hold the
key to the situation but i cannot resist the fascinat-
ing lure of exploring the mysteries of space and the
fourth dimension and in that way i hope to discover
facts which may be used for the benefit of my fellow
men

    x hat i asked him do you propose to do
vv next you have proved you can conquer
time and space i shall no more question your state-
ment that you have discovered the fourth dimension
nor shall i doubt that you have harnessed the forces
of gravitation but what more can you do i can
scarcely see what new facts you can discover regard-
ing the elimination of time

  ah there you show the laymans lack of imagina-
tion and ignorance of the possibilities of science
he exclaimed as yet my friend i have but touched
the fringe of the unknown i am like an explorer
about to enter a new and unknown land i have en-
tered the outer fringe of the territory but i have yet
to plunge into the mysterious depths before me

  i confess i declared that i do not get the drift
of what you are saying it seems to me that as far
as exploring is concerned you might go on flying
around the world forever and ever and really find out
nothing that you do not already know now if you
should test your machine for  

  around the earth he ejaculated surely you
do not imagine that i intend to confine my observa-
tions to circumnavigating the globe no it is the
realm of space i shall explore if by merely travel-
ing around the earth i can conquer time and travel
into the future for an hour or two just stop and
think what it may reveal if i travel through the
earths orbit think what discoveries of science i
might make by beating our terrestrial globe around
the sun why friend i could gain months years
where i now gain hours i could learn the innermost
secrets of time of the past and of the future i   
i stopped in my tracks and stared at him sure-
ly i cried you are not serious in this you surely
do not intend to attempt to leave the earths atmo-
sphere on any such mad fools errand

  why not he replied is it any madder any
more impossible than you thought my statements of
an hour or two ago yes my friend i not only in-
tend to attempt such a journey but i start today
this very afternoon and you alone of all men are to
witness the first departure of a human being for the
uncharted unknown realms of space

  and if i asked you should succeed in hurling
your confounded machine through space without kill-
ing yourself when do you expect to return to relate
your experiences

  doctor mentiroso was silent for a space evidently
thinking deeply then taking a note book and pencil
from his pocket he made some rapid calculations

  if i am correct in my deductions and my appa-
ratus does not fail me i should be back here in lima
in the early part of the year  was his amazing
statement
discoveries of doctor mentiroso



  what i almost shouted youll be back in
 and this is 

  of course he chuckled if i can encircle the
globe and get back to my starting point four hours
before i leave why shouldnt i tear off through
space follow the earths orbit around the sun and get
back twenty or thirty years before i start or if i
reverse my direction why shouldnt i go an equal
time mto the future

  ill be hanged if i know i admitted but for
my part id far rather remain in the present

  but you will be present when i leave wontyou
he begged i want some witness so that if i should
return in the future or the
past there wont be any
question as to when i
started

  i suppose ill have to

i told him but im not
approving it

  by this time we had re-
turned to don fenomenos
house and he was leading
me to the enclosed court
with its strange time-defy-
ing machine i was i think
in a sort of daze for other-
wise i cannot account for
my action in countenancing
his mad scheme but the
astounding things i had
heard and seen had had an almost hypnotic effect
and scarcely realizing what he was about to under-
take i saw him approach the apparatus draw back
the sliding panel and prepare to enter

  you need not worry over my physical welfare
he remarked ive been preparing for this trip and
i am well provisioned though i do not believe food
is essential in the fourth dimension

  i suppose i remarked dryly that as you are go-
ing several years into the past the food which you ate
for the past twenty years or so will serve just as well
something of that sort perhaps he grinned
and now please record the exact time when i
leave good bye amigo mio i will not ask you to
await my return but ill notify you at once when
im back ill have some very interesting informa-
tiotf to impart im sure

    could scarcely be expected to wait back a
a score of years i reminded him and i agree
with you that if you do return you will most cer-
tainly have an abundant mass of interesting informa-
tion personally though i feel that both you and
your discoveries are lost to science and the world
from this moment

  im sorry you wont accompany me he declared
ignoring my caustic remarks well once more
good friend adios or perhaps better hasta luego
for this is au revoir and not good-bye

  i leaped forward arid grasped his hand and bade
him a warm farewell then suddenly remembering
that i might be within his
damnable fourth dimension
limit i sprang back and
away from the black stone
pedestal the next moment
the panel had been closed
and he had disappeared
within the machine recol-
lecting my former experi-
ence i hurried away from
the machine but before i
had taken ten steps i was
swept from my feet by the
rush of air i had felt be-
fore glancing about as
best i might i saw that the
machine with doctor men-
tiroso had vanished

  despite the fact that i was not to await his
return i felt compelled to remain within the
court and torn by a thousand conflicting emo-
tions i maintained my lonely vigil throughout the
night indeed forweeks i visited the place daily
each time hoping against hope that the strange
machine would once more gladden my eyes as it
rested upon its pedestal but don fenomeno has
not returned

  but still though my common sense tells me he has
gone forever i cannot rid myself of the conviction
that some day my peruvian friend frill sweep down
triumphantly from his journey through space but
perhaps he really returned twenty-seven years ago
to this day i do not know whether he was serious or
was merely joking when he spoke of returning in
the year 

the end

what is the answer

 sjow that you have read the astounding
  discoveries of dr mentiroso you will want
 to take a deep breath and come up for air no
 doubt if you are at all human your head must
 be in a whirl and you probably mill not know
 what is fact and what is fiction at any rate
 what is the answer to dr mentirosos experi-
 ences

 perhaps you can figure it out yourself but
 it ivill take you quite a while before you hit
 upon the right solution at any rate you may
 wish to discuss it with your friends for a
 month it will make excellent discussion the
 answer will be published in the december issue

out his right hand commandingly speaking a volley of harsh words demanding the thing she held in her hand


what went before	

     lair a newspaper man while seeking an interview
with thomas priestley who was on the point of losing
ins inheritance of several millions because it seemed
impossible to obtain within several hours the signatures of
three living relatives who were scattered in different corners
of the earth comes to the laboratory of professor rufus
fleckner scientist and inventor who in the presence of
twelve eminent men of science is demonstrating his latest
invention the telephonoscope which penetrates all matter
eliminates space and catches the lowest sounds it is also
possible to project images and sound by means of the tele-
phonoscope rays

  by projecting young priestleys image before his three
respective relatives fleckner obtains the signatures of all
releasing their claims on the fortune

  before leazing the laboratory that day a chance remark
by blair made in newspaper fashion to the effect that
fleckner had undoubtedly established a corner on privacy
set fleckner thinking about such possibilities and later results
in near disaster and panic

  unexpectedly they priestley as one of the stockholders
of the new company formed to manufacture this marvelous
machine blair as a newspaper man sworn to secrecy for a

while and ruth stimson confidential secretary unearth a
gigantic working crime trust which boasted for its member-
ship some of the best known and trusted business men
bankers politicians statesmen etc by throwing rays in
different places at the same time they soon learn all the
secret workings of this perfect-working organization engaged
in criminal acts they also learn that the acting head of
the trust is none other than the president-elect mortimer
chandler and that his three chief aides are judge tanner
assistant district attorney winter and dorgan who form
a council of three

  the hiding-place of the vast treasures that are periodically
looted from banks and large corporations etc however is
still a mystery and prof fleckners main goal has now be-
come the finding of the treasure trove one day while they
are all intently watching the journey of the truck containing
the last haul and feel certain that at last they will discover
the hiding place of the treasure trove for chandler meets
the truck and is about to proceed with it alone miss stimson
jerks a lever and projects a cry of warning to chandler he
abandons the truck in panic fear they watch for a long
time but can see no attempt to recover it

  after an interval of half an hour blair returns to the
machine to find that the van has disappeared

the crime trust retaliates

nudged fleckners shoulder sharply
he awoke with a start

  humph been asleep he ejaculated
he glanced at the clock
four oclock dozed pretty nearly
a half-hour three thirty when i looked last how
long you been out here anything happened

  he looked at chandlers restless image first then
at the section of mountain road he too rubbed
his eyes and looked again then he leaped to his
feet excitedly

 wheres the van he demanded you and
priestley been up to something 

  he whirled on me accusingly

  priestley is presumably still asleep i replied
coldly i just came out
of my room at any rate
we could hardly have en-
gineered the stealing in the
few minutes youve been
asleep even if we could
have done it without wak-
ing you

  but he seemed still sus-
picious of us he tiptoed
over to priestleys room
and looked in i followed

t confess i wondered a
little preposterous as the
idea seemed if priestley could have had a hand in
it but priestley was sleeping the sound sleep of

healthy exhaustion fleckner shook him roughly
and when he was awake told him what had happened
but he did not repeat the imputation he had hurled
at me in the first excitement of his discovery priest-
leys astonishment seemed too genuine to be simu-
lated

  priestley came out and under fleckners direc-
tions we each took a ray and made a systematic
search of the hills all about the spot where the
van had stood the ground was frozen and there
was no snow so we had no tracks to guide us

  at daybreak we gave it up and sat in discouraged
discussion of many possible theories my suspicions
of the girl i kept to myself without knowing exactly
why perhaps it was my consciousness of their
vagueness possibly it was natural chivalry it may
have been the lingering appeal of a pair of violet
eyes i suspect it was all three at any rate i
contributed no suggestions of value and neither of
the other two thought of
miss stimson in connec-
tion with the vanished van

  fleckner was inclined to
fancy some belated mo-
torist had discovered the
van and salvaged it in
that case if the finder was
honest he would advertise
his find it would make a
most sensational news
story the finding of two
million dollars out on a
lonely road without a
guardian it would become even more sensational
when it developed that no one had missed this tidy

little sum and that there were no lawful claimants
for it

  of course if the owner were dishonest he would
hide his treasure-trove and in the course of time
try to use it in that case he would doubtless give
himself away eventually

  priestley however stubbornly clung to the belief
that chandler had somehow got word to a confed-
erate while fleckner slept that man he believed
had flown out in a swift plane and taken the van to
a safe hiding-place where it would await another
attempt by the chief

  that well be able to determine as soon as chand-
ler gets back in touch with his men the professor
decided

  at eight oclock miss stimson returned to her
duties as usual there was no hint in her manner of
any remaining embarrassment over the occurrences
of the night before her green shade was in place
again so i caught no more glimpses of her disturbing
eyes fleckner greeted her rather curtly and priest-
ley with a politely impersonal inquiry as to her
health

  but we were immediately afterward engrossed
with chandlers movements he went back to town
on the  train and at  was closeted alone in
his office in his town house immediately he went
into the telephone booth and turned one of the
secret rings fleckner swung on the direction-
finder and a moment later switched one telephono-
scope ray on the little private dining-room where the
telephone bell was ringing merrily

  chandler meantime having started the call to the
riccadona came out of the booth and began pacing
the floor

  a few minutes later a waiter at the cafe passing
down the corridor heard the bell in the private
room he went in and pressed a button at the
side of the instrument and the ringing ceased at
the same instant the phone in chandlers office gave
one sharp ring evidently a signal that his call had
been noted

  the waiter at the cafe hurried downstairs and to
the desk

  the other bell is ringing in no  he said
and departed on his duties

  the cashier went into the phone booth back of
him and called up judge tanner at his chambers

  this is tom he said your reservation for
no  is o k

  judge tanner hung up the phone put on his hat
and fifteen minutes later was in no  at the ricca-
dona

  an ingenious system for getting in touch with
his gang at almost any time fleckner commented
he didnt dare use it when he got in last night i
suppose for fear a too unseasonable hour would
arouse suspicion

  tanner went through the form of ordering a
breakfast and then connected with chandlers study
by the will phone chandler looked his intense
relief when he found himself again in touch with
his chief aid

  the goods arrived at no  on time and the
man in charge left after getting the signal as
agreed chandler related but the man sent to
get them was trapped and had to clear out and leave
them

  some one jumped out of the bush and another

voice sounded like a womans he said called for
him to stop he barely escaped i dont think he
was identified but i didnt dare order a move for
fear wed been betrayed and would be caught send
a discreet tracer over the road to see if he can
locate the goods dont have him make a move
to claim them unless its perfectly safe there may
be a trap there set another tracer after the traitor

  chandler hung up the professor looked at
priestley triumphantly

  what did i tell you he remarked tauntingly
you see chandler is as much in the dark as we are
i wonder now what could have happened to that
van

  he looked speculatively through the open door to
where miss stimson sat bent over her notes i was
afraid for a moment that he might be about to
question her but judge tanner claimed his attention

  the judge had connected with the underground
clubroom and repeated chandlers news to one of
the black-robed brethren who immediately busied
himself with a series of cryptic calls as a result
a swift airplane left an up-town hangar an hour
later its passenger an innocent-looking traveling
salesman for the new york sun motor company
he flew over putnam county back and forth for
hours at a three-mile level his plane blurred by a
thin screen of vapor scouring the earth with a power-
ful field-glass

  at the same time the new york state agency for
the heatless light company decided suddenly to
put its field force on for an intensive house to house
campaign in putnam county every canvasser our
records showed was a member of the crime trust

  also during the day word was sent in cipher to
every district representative in the country and the
dragnet was thoroughly set for the missing van

  meanwhile we as well as the agents for the
trust were scouring every edition of the papers for
a story of the finding of a mysterious van loaded
with treasure but the day passed without news
and the day lengthened into a fruitless week the
judge took all his meals at the riccadona and had
long conferences with chandler which brought them
nowhere

  during all this time the trust company continued
doing business without the slightest suspicion of its
loss

   at length on the eighth night after the disappear-
ance of the van tanner got a call from a man in
the secret clubroom who was a new one to us
apparently from the conversation that followed he
was in charge of a section appointed to ferret out
and punish traitors in the confusion of trying to
watch all the complicated communications sent out
the day after the robbery we had evidently over-
looked this particular thread in the tangled skein

  we think weve located a traitor this man de-
clared we havent positive evidence but its pretty
strong we believe he knows nothing of what be-
came of the van later but probably he had a griev-
ance and tipped off the state police who nearly
caught the man sent to meet the van we believe
the police are keeping the facts from the public
hoping to trap us

  ill call you back in a few minutes said the
judge

  then he switched to chandler and reported

  what do you recommend  chandler asked
treasures of tantalus



  wed better take no chances the judge advised
suppose were mistaken better to sacrifice an in-
nocent man than run the slightest risk of having the
lot of us caught

  youre right chandler agreed use your
judgment

  tanner switched back to the detective

  the order is to take extreme measures he re-
ported

  the detective left the phone booth and strolled
about the main room after a moment he jogged
an elbow of a man he passed and a few minutes
later met him in one of the little council-rooms

  no  is condemned the detective said laconi-
cally

  ill attend to him at once the other responded
in a most matter-of-fact tone any idea who he
is

  not the slightest replied the other thats for
you to find out

  ill shoot a little perfume into his clothes and
identify him outside

  very good  agreed the other we all sat chilled
with horror as the sense of impending tragedy
dawned on us

  priestley was the first to speak

  this is murder he gasped we must stop it

  well have no exposures at present fleckner
declared sternly weve mixed things up enough
already

  priestley remained silent but i knew he was un-
convinced

  the executioner roamed about the main room until
he came upon no  standing in a little group
about a billiard-table watching a game the execu-
tioner had taken from his pocket a small atomizer
filled with a colorless fluid holding this in his
hand under his robe he casually walked up behind
his victim and pretending to become absorbed in
the game placed the nozzle of the atomizer against
the others back and pressed the bulb

  carrying odors is the one thing the telephono-
scope wont do fleckner remarked

  the scent must have been a delicate one for no
one about the billiard-table gave any signs of noting
an offensive odor the executioner strolled away
after a moment and a little later signaled another
man to one side

  ive put the scent on a victim he whispered
go up and stand at the store end of the exit trail
any one who comes out that way with the scent on
his clothes ill take the other exit

  the executioner then left the club appearing pres-
ently in ordinary clothes on the sidewalk in front
of the rear entrance to the little tobacco shop he
was a dapper-looking blond young man having the
appearance of a gilded youth with nothing on his
mind presently his assistant a pale dark fellow
rather slouchily dressed took up his post in the
store

  it was over an hour before no  emerged he
went directly to the street almost brushing against
the dapper little man who had been ordered to kill
him

  the executioner gave no sign of noticing the
heavy uninteresting-looking stranger who walked
by him and down into the street but we noted that
his nostrils dilated and his eyes gleamed with satis-
faction he crossed the avenue leisurely and keep-

ing his prey in sight strolled along in the direction
he was following

  do you mean to say you refuse to prevent a
murder priestley demanded fiercely turning on
fleckner

   the professor winced a little but held his ground
i absolutely refuse he said there is nothing
we could do that wouldnt give us away now and
spoil our future plans its too risky anyhow
the fellow deserves death	

   priestley stood over him with clenched fists his
face a blaze of fury

  i warned you once before fleckner interposed
hastily that if you resist me it will be disastrous
to your fortune and your reputation as well as to
the good you hope to accomplish in the world by
your investment

   i fully expected to see priestley defy him at any
cost instead after a moment he pulled himself
together and turned on his heel

  very well he muttered at any rate i wont
stay and see murder committed im going out for
a while till its over

  good  fleckner exclaimed in relief youve
stuck too close here your nerves are unstrung
better run home and get some sleep ill call you
if anything interesting happens

   priestley went out without another word

  i had a fleeting thought that we ought to keep
priestley covered by one of our rays but checked
the idea without voicing it such a suggestion to
fleckner might seem to indicate suspicion of my new
friend anyhow the professor and i had about all
we could attend to alone miss stimson was in the
other room catching up on some neglected records
which left only two of us to keep the ramifications
of the trust plot on the screen at once

  i wished many times afterward that i had obeyed
-my impulse to trail priestley

   meantime the victim of the trusts suspicion con-
tinued on to his home a few blocks down went
in and after a little to bed his shadower after
carefully studying the surroundings from the out-
side entered the apartment-house where his victim
had just disappeared and said to the hall attendant
i came to call on some one who i think just
came in-the thick-set dark gentleman

  you mean mr gersten

  gersten doesnt seem as if that was his name
i met him only once and ive lost his card i have
a business appointment with him what apartment
is he in

   sixtieth floor apartment 

  oh thats not he then the man jm after
lives on the thirty-first floor isnt this apartment-
house no 

   oh no its no 

  ah ive mistaken the house he went out
hastily with the information he sought apparently
the blow was not to fall at once for he took the
subway and a little later reached his own home and
went to bed

   but here again our vigilant rays missed something
as it turned out later

  fleckner seeing no likelihood of any more ex-
citement that night left one ray fixed on the sleeping
form of gersten alias no  another on the under-
ground club and a third on gerstens would-be exe-


amazing stories

cutioner chandler and tanner of course also held
a place on other sections but they too were asleep

  fleckner stretched himself wearily looked at the
clock and called miss stimson

  there was no reply

  shes gone some time ago i remarked its
long past time

  she should have spoken to me before she went
he said irritably

  at that moment a door slammed outside there
was a clatter of feet in the ante-room the labora-
tory door burst open and miss stimson hurled her-
self in

  theyve got him theyve got him she cried

  we sprang to our feet in astonishment got
whom what do you mean who are they de-
manded the professor

  mr priestley-he tried to save mr gersten-
the trust caught him and took him away in a cab
-i tried to trail it-lost it

  she sank to the floor in a faint

chapter xiii
at grips with the crime trust

we stared in doubt and amazement at the
limp figure of the girl then by common
impulse we searched the screen to verify
her startling announcement of the kidnaping of
priestley all was quiet around the apartment house
in which gersten the condemned trust agent lived
there was no sign of disturbance in the apartment
itself gersten was still sleeping peacefully without
any appearance of having moved since we last looked
at his reflected image

  fleckner began frantically trying out all the tele-
phonoscope connections we had-the young assassin
chief in his home the underground club even chand-
ler no sign of activity he even swept the ray up
and down the quiet streets radiating from gerstens
home peering in every taxicab hoping to find the one
in which priestley had been taken prisoner but
that was a futile proceeding begotten of panic and
he quickly abandoned it

  certain it was that priestley had not arrived home
he made doubly certain of that by searching the
house and calling the drowsy butler on the telephone

  meantime i was doing what i could to restore
the girl to her senses she revived presently but
it was some time before she could tell a coherent
story even then she was strangely reticent and
evasive at some points in her narrative

  i heard mr priestley arguing with professor
fleckner about trying to keep the trust from mur-
dering this man gersten she said when mr
priestley went by my desk something in the way he
looked and walked made me think he was going to
try to interfere with those murderers all by himself
i knew he would be in great danger i thought i
might help him or at least warn the police if neces-
sary

  i followed without his knowing it i dont be-
lieve he knows me anyhow with my hat and coat on
and my eye-shade off he went to the public phone
booths on the corner and called up mr gersten i
listened in i cant tell you how i managed it i
learned the secret when i was a telephone manager

before i came here do you know that mr gersten
this no  weve been watching is an old friend of
mr priestley

   hello john this is tom priestley he said
when he got his connection

   why hello tom gersten answered where
you been keeping yourself and what do you mean
pulling a man out of bed this time of night 

   listen john he said your lifes in danger
ive just overheard a gang youve got mixed up
with plotting to kill you they think youve been
betraying them theyre watching your place now
i cant tell you any more youll know best how
to handle it i advise you to call up the district
attorney himself in the morning and get protection
stay off the street youll know how to handle it
better than i anyhow you know the gang ill
help you if i can i think i know a way i cant
tell you more im surprised to find youre in with
such a gang but i cant see you killed 

  but fleckner broke in gersten didnt talk
with any one on the phone weve been watching
him right along hes been asleep

  then its just as i thought the girl exclaimed
one of the trust tapped his phone circuit with an
instrument as soon as they located him at home
tie disguised his voice and answered instead of ger-
sten when mr priestley called thats how they
trapped him

  mr priestley came out of the telephone station
and started to walk back here i watched him from
across the street a man hurried along by him in
the same direction and must have sprayed an an-
esthetic in his face because mr priestley stopped
suddenly and staggered the strange man turned
and caught him before he fell just then a cab
whirled up a man stepped out and helped the
other man put mr priestley in the cab then they
both got in and drove away i started to scream but
saw a policeman coming and knew i mustnt attract
the police theyd kill mr priestley right away
if they thought the police were after them as it
is theyll keep him alive for a while and try to dis-
cover what he knows i couldnt find a cab to follow
in so i came back here thats all but you must
find him quick you must

  she showed signs of becoming hysterical we
tried to question her but all she would say was-
get your rays to work dont bother with me
i dont know any more

  there seemed to be nothing to do but follow her
advice but though we searched for the rest of the
night we accomplished nothing more than to verify
miss stimsons belief that the trust agents had
killed the telephone antenna connecting with the
instrument in gerstens apartment by the use of a
high power wave sender which burned out the deli-
cate connections they had then evidently tuned
their own outlaw instrument into the same wave
length and as she had surmised answered his calls
we tried the expedient of calling up his number
but apparently the listeners-in now suspected a trap
and refused to answer

  at half-past eight in the morning our screen
showed judge tanner appearing for breakfast in
the private dining-room at the riccadona immedi-
ately he called the underground club and got a report
from the assassin chief
treasures of tantalus



  i identified no  and had him trailed hell
die a natural death within twenty-four hours if you
say the word but something happened again
things are going wrong and its getting on my
nerves im even beginning to wonder if  is
guilty anyhow he isnt the only one you know
young tom priestley the priestley millionaire
well it seems hes a friend of  and tried to call
him up late last night and warn him we cut in and
caught priestley and are holding him for orders

  the question now is is priestley a member of
the organization  if he is hes a traitor if he isnt
then theres a leak to the outside and weve got to
find it and see how far its gone and kill as many
people as is necessary to stop it or our whole game
is up

  judge tanner turned pale and trembled visibly
as he got this startling information he thought
for some moments before replying

  ill call you back he managed to say at last

  he cut off the assassin chief and rang on chand-
ler in a halting manner strangely at variance with
the suave judges usually assured address he broke
the news to his unknown chief who was hardly less
affected by it than his subordinate

  this connects up with the disappearance of the
van-load of money chandler ruminated its a
deeper plot than we thought tell your men to keep
this priestley alive till theyve got all they can out
of him find out if possible if he belongs to the
organization try the supreme sign on him no
use to try tracing back through the recruiting chain
every one is bound to name no names unless of a
proven traitor theyd suspect trickery and refuse
for the most part get at it quick meantime let
 live till this is cleared up

  tanner transmitted these orders back to the as-
sassin who promptly left the clubroom we fol-
lowed this fellow closely all day with our ray but
learned nothing of priestleys whereabouts he
talked with numerous people and telephoned fre-
quently but apparently when treachery was afoot
all members of the trust used excessive precautions
all communications were strictly in a code and quite
different from the one he had previously unraveled

  by evening we were in the depths of despair and
alarm professor fleckner and i managed to pre-
serve a moderately calm exterior but miss stim-
son was frankly hysterical over the situation we
sat in the laboratory by the telephonoscope screen
all that night dozing at intervals from sheer weari-
ness but for the most part trying many new but
futile angles of ray-search and debating various
schemes of learning priestleys whereabouts and
effecting a rescue

  i was all for trying a scheme of scaring some
one of the members higher up in the trust into re-
vealing priestleys hiding-place by using our ray
projector and presenting one of our images carefully
disguised to the right man

  but fleckner objected whom would you ap-
proach chandler tanner any of the others
whom we have identified positively as concerned in
priestleys disappearance i doubt if any one of
them even the chief assassin knows where he is
that detail has been left to agents whom we havent
placed yet if any one excepting chandler him-
self was frightened into trying to find priestley

theyd simply kill him and priestleys jailer then
maybe your suggestion might work failing that
ill try the lever on chandler im not hopeful of
the result conditions arent ripe yet for a direct
approach to that gentleman but we cant afford to
risk leaving priestley with them until he breaks
down and gives us all away

  i had a feeling as he spoke that the old man was
more concerned for his own safety and the success
of his schemes than he was for priestley himself
nevertheless his argument appealed to me as sound

  it was nearly eight in the morning when i awoke
with a start after a longer doze than usual miss
stimson had arisen and crossed over to where pro-
fessor fleckner sat moodily studying the screen her
hysteria had passed there was in its place an air
of calm determination

  professor fleckner she announced coolly ill
release mr priestley

  you he shouted in amazement

  how i demanded

  i cant tell you how not at present anyhow
just let me go for a while meantime keep mr
chandler covered closely you remember he is to
be out at conferences all day to-day

  she went out before we recovered sufficiently from
our amazement to make any comment

  what do you make of it fleckner demanded
is the girl crazy shes certainly acted strangely
ever since that night when she warned chandler
away from that van-load of money

  i dont know i admitted i do think she ad-
mires our friend priestley greatly and his danger
may have unbalanced her a little i think it would
be wise to keep one of the rays on her while she is
out if she goes wild altogether we can warn a
policeman to take her in charge and pay no attention
to what she says

  good idea he agreed

  he got miss stimson on the screen before she
reached the street we watched her progress from
then on with such absorbing interest that it became
almost impossible to keep our other rays adjusted
properly on all the persons we were trying to watch
at once

  the girl went first to her home in an apartment
a few blocks away and when she came out again
she was veiled and dressed so differently that it was
hard to recognize in her the demure little office
mouse of the green eyeshade she went by subway
up to the street corner nearest to chandlers home
there she ascended to the upper street level and
a position in a public telephone station opposite the
chandler home where she could watch it through
an open window

  in a little while the president-elect came out got
into his car and was driven away we had half
expected the girl to waylay and plead with him or
make some wild threat fleckner was on the point
of projecting my image before a police officer on
the next corner and having the girl apprehended
before she took any such disastrous step but
to our relief chandler was driven off without any
move on her part

  instead we were amazed to see her calmly cross
the street and push the announcer button at the
chandler front door

  i wish to see mrs simmons the housekeeper


amazing stories

she announced with quiet dignity when the butler
appeared i am a friend of hers

  a few minutes later a gray haired woman of
about sixty appeared and regarded her caller with
considerable perplexity

  they were in a small reception room off the main
hall the girl stepped past the housekeeper and to
that good womans obvious amazement softly closed
the door

  then she turned back to the housekeeper and
before the latter could protest she raised a warning
hand

  dont give me away mrs simmons some one
might overhear

  with that she raised her veil

  the woman choked back an exclamation her
face showed mingled affection and alarm

  you here she whispered

  i had to look inside once more i watch for
him sometimes i saw him drive away just now
i couldnt resist one more peep cant you take me
up to his study where he lives so much if any of
the family see me say its a young friend of yours
youre taking up to your rooms and wanted to sjiow
around a little

  the girls voice trembled and there were tears in
her eyes if she was acting it was an exceedingly
clever bit of work

  fleckner chuckled dryly

  another dark chapter in the good chandlers life
i certainly am surprised at miss stimson however

  the housekeeper hesitated

  its a risk she said but you know id do any-
thing for you ruth

  the good woman was weeping quietly

  thats the same dear old mrs simmons the
girl exclaimed patting her on the shoulder

  mrs simmons opened the door and peered out
there was no one in the hall she motioned the
girl to follow and they went cautiously out and up
a rear elevator that led directly into chandlers study
on the top floor

  the girl sank in a chair and gazed raptly about
her for some minutes finally she roused herself
with an effort and glanced at her watch

  oh i promised to phone a friend at ten she
exclaimed may i use this one

  she indicated the booth containing the phone with
the secret attachments through which we had so
often watched chandler issue orders to his followers

  why certainly dearie the housekeeper agreed

  miss stimson entered the booth closed the
sound-proof door and then to our sudden illumina-
tion twisted the ring that threw on the secret con-
nection with the little dining-room at the riccadona
where judge tanner was just finishing his break-
fast

  a moment later she was giving orders to the de-
luded agent of the crime trust in the same husky
half-whisper in which the real head of that dis-
reputable band was wont to issue his fnandates

chapter xiv
miss stimson uses direct methods

the sheer audacity of the girl took our breath
away what her former connection with the
 chandler household had been i could not
imagine for the sinister suggestion made by fleckner

somehow did not ring true my instincts rebelled
against it then there was the evident respect of
that manifestly conventional mrs simmons

  but another possibility flashed into my mind had
this girl all along been an agent of the crime trust
spying upon us would that account for the episode
of the treasure van if so why had she not be-
trayed us long before on the other hand she was
now evidently working against the organization had
her devotion to priestley which i had been quietly
noting converted her to our side i wondered if
professor fleckner had thought of these startling
possibilities and what action he might take

  but be all that as it might her quick feminine
mind had grasped a simple and direct plan of action
and she had the courage to carry it out promptly
we gasped in admiration at her boldness and in-
genuity as we listened to the orders she was giving
to judge tanner over the secret telephone

  ive just got some important information about
our latest prisoner young priestley she whispered
and from judge tanners expression it was evident
that he was entirely deceived by the disguised voice
he is refusing to give information about the rest
of his crowd because he expects to be rescued soon
they had advance information somehow as to
where he was to be hidden and they have a number
of our men spotted weve got to make a quick
shift and get him in the hands of an entirely new
group that theyre not yet wise to my plan is to
let him escape and pull the old crowd off his trail
altogether then while hes free hell go straight to
his men my new bunch of trailers will follow and
well grab the whole gang what do you think of
that scheme

  an excellent one tanner agreed enthusiastic-
ally

  that girl has a great head fleckner exclaimed
i never half appreciated her before but i dont
quite understand it i dont think i can ever trust
her again shes too clever and women are flighty
variable creatures at best and theres been some
sort of tie between her and chandler thats evi-
dent

  fleckner was too absorbed in present happenings
to follow out his reasoning but for me a sudden
light was shed on her hysterical performance which
had frightened chandler away from the treasure van
that night just as he was about to lead us to the main
treasure the girl i was convinced had acted with
a purpose on that occasion she had not wanted
chandler to guide us to the treasures of tantalus
was it sentiment for chandler that prompted her
or had she an interest in the treasure itself that
was what bothered me at any rate she seemed now
to be acting in our behalf

  but was she that was another question that
popped into my head a second later priestley re-
leased from the trust would be in her power was
he safe there or was the girl a deserter from the
trust and was now a member of a rival gang which
through her aid had stolen the treasure van and was
now cleverly using professor fleckners great inven-
tion for its own ends 

  that last fleeting suspicion seemed at that moment
so fantastic that i instantly dismissed it and gave
my undivided attention to the screen again

  this is my plan the girl was saying follow
closely and act quioklv theres no time to lose
treasures of tantalus



get your present attendants on priestley out of the
way as far and fast and secretly as you can look
out for trailers have a new man bring him in a
cab down to the esplanade in van cortlandt park
arriving there exactly at noon my new men will be
on hand to trail him to his gang right at the center
of the esplanade in front of the wright statue
have him slow down and tell priestley that he had
been ordered to take him away and kill him but that
he couldnt commit murder so he was going to rebel
and let him escape then have him untie priestley
and turn him loose have the man drive away as
quickly as possible my other men will do the rest

  tanner agreed without comment as was his custom
on getting commands from chandler his careful
repetition of the orders to his agent in the under-
ground club made it evident that he suspected noth-
ing wrong

  but again from there on we lost the trail in the
confusion of multiple messages all in code this
time however it was not important that we should
trace the orders further

  for promptly at noon we enjoyed the immense
relief of seeing miss stiinsons directions carried out
to the letter

  van cortlandt park esplanade even in those days
was thronged with noon-hour strollers from the fac-
tories along its southern margin and a steady stream
of motors filled its roadways miss stimson could
not have chosen a better place in which to carry out
her scheme than this spot where any slightly unusual
occurrence would pass unnoticed in the throng
for a half hour before the appointed time we swept
the locality with our ray studying every loiterer to
see if we recognized a known trust agent but we
failed to see any familiar face or suspicious character

  it was exactly twelve oclock when a cab which
had been circling slowly around the esplanade drew
up and stopped for a moment in front of the wright
statue

  the door opened and priestley stepped out a pale
and haggard priestley but with bearing undaunted
he stood for a moment in front of the statue and
looked about him suspiciously the cab drove
rapidly away

  just then he noticed miss stimson strolling to-
ward the statue she was dressed differently than
in the morning but was still veiled catching sight
of priestley she stepped up to him briskly

  good morning she greeted him cheerily you
are a little late  then she added quickly in an un-
dertone its miss stimson dont look surprised
youre safe now but we cant be too careful

  priestley rose to the occasion and checked his
momentary confusion with a laugh

  i didnt see you coming and you startled me he
said im sorry im late what can i do to atone

  you can buy me a nice luncheon at briarcliff
inn my car is right over here im going to show
you how fast a real lady can drive

  this delxmair easy-speaking young woman was
still another miss stimson to us i realized more
than ever that the girl was a consummate actress

  she led the way across to the parking station and
they entered a swift-looking little coupe the girl
backed the car skilfully out of the line and it glided
swiftly away northward

  then just as we swung the ray forward to follow
the speeding coupe a cab flashed on the other side

of the screen breaking all speed limits in defiance
of the traffic officer at the southern entrance of the
esplanade

  better throw on another ray and investigate that
cab professor fleckner directed anxiously as he ad-
justed the ray he was controlling so that we might
keep a close-up of miss stimsons coupe on the
screen

  i swung in a second ray and as i picked up the in-
terior of the cab my instinctive fear was realized
it was the cab which had brought priestley to the
wright statue just now still driven by the man
who had released him this mans face was a pic-
ture of desperate fear beside him sat another man
registering both anger and alarm in his pugnacious
countenance they were both straining their eyes
toward miss stimsons fleeing car into which they
had evidently seen priestley enter

  the situation was as evident as though it had been
told in words miss stimsons haste had been justi-
fied somewhere along the line the crime trusts
momentarily deluded gang had discovered the trick
played  them the second man in the pursuing
cab had evidently been sent in haste to undo the
error and arrived near the scene in time to meet the
man who had just released priestley

  and for the moment it seemed that miss stim-
sons clever artifice had been wasted all uncon-
scious of pursuit she was driving northward as fast
as speed regulations permitted but far too slowly
to keep ahead of the pursuing cab for more than a
few minutes

  the crime trusts agent in his desperation hurled
speed regulations to the winds pedestrians fled in
every direction vehicles shot toward the curbing
to the right and left

  warn the girl ill get a traffic officer after the
cab  i shouted to fleckner above the tumult of the
crowd and the snorting of motor-horns that filled our
little room from our sounding screen as though we
were actually on the edge of the throng

  fleckner projected his voice into the coupe
warned the girl with a word and in terror she threw
her car into full speed and shot out of the esplanade
into a park road with the swiftness of an airplane
at that she was barely holding her own against the
swiftly pursuing cab

  in less than a minute some quarter of a mile
away i located a motor-cycle traffic-officer trundling
his machine leisurely along the speeders hidden
from his sight by a clump of shrubbery

  to avoid creating public consternation by a seem-
ing miracle i projected my image among the bushes
and seemed to step out of them into the path of the
officer

  theres a speeder playing havoc with the crowd
over there i shouted excitedly pointing across the
esplanade

  without a question he jumped on his cycle and
was gone like a flash hopefully i drew my image
back into the bushes and cut off the projector if
the officer should overhaul and arrest the driver of
the cab it would give our friends a chance after all

  breathlessly fleckner and i followed the triple
race on our screen the coupe slowly losing its lead
over the recklessly driven cab but-thank heaven
-the motor-cycle gaining on it much more rapidly

  they left van cortlandt park behind and flew un


amazing stories

the yonkers boulevard a few minutes later they
were swinging perilously around the sharp curves
of the westchester park drives

  meantime miss stimson behind the screen of her
car top had been ordering a lightning change act
that seemed rather futile under the circumstances
under her directions priestley had hauled a feminine
outfit-cape skirt hat veil and gloves-from under
the seat and put them on over his own clothing
without too close inspection he looked like a large-
framed middle-aged woman

  miss stimson turned the wheel over to him while
she changed her own hat veil and jacket for an
assortment of entirely different style she looked
fifteen years older and a dowdy contrast to the trim
stylish figure of a few minutes before

  she evidently hoped to get out of sight of her
pursuers long enough to turn about and in these
disguises give them the slip fleckner heartened
her by telling her that the motor officer might give
her that chance though a dubious one at best

  within five minutes that hope seemed about to be
realized the motor-cycle drew along side the cab
and its rider signaled the driver to stop then our
hopes were dashed again

  the second man in the cab turned back his coat
lapel and to our consternation displayed the badge
of a central office detective he shouted something
to the motor-cycle officer and the latter instead of
insisting on stopping the cab let his cycles speed out
another notch and shot by in pursuit of the coupe

  by invoking the aid of the law we had merely
made the capture of our friends doubly sure the
trust had played the same game it was only a
matter of minutes now when the motor-cycle would
overtake them and miss stimsons pitiful little sub-
terfuge would avail them nothing the pursuers
had long since noted the number and style of the car

  but just as i was in despair the genius of fleck-
ner again came to the rescue

  let me handle your lever a minute blair he
exclaimed suddenly get one of those spare lengths
of power cable out of the storeroom

  now he directed when i had brought the small
roll containing about a rod of half-inch wire cable
bend one end so it will hook over that window-
catch then carry the other end across the room
stretching it in front of the screen ill turn on the
magnifier and then project this cable so it appears
in image like a two-inch hawser stretched across the
road in front of that motor-cycle and cab thatll
stop em for a minute ill guarantee

  the scheme worked the motor-cycle and the
cab flew around the bend ancj their drivers saw across
the road a few rods ahead what appeared to be a
heavy cable stretched taut at a height that meant a
sure wrecking for both vehicles brakes screeched
and they came to a dead stop within two yards of the
apparent obstruction

  all three men swore roundly and stared stupidly
at the cable the speeding coupe in the meantime
lengthened its lead by a quarter of a mile

  theyve stopped fleckner told miss stimson
again projecting his voice into the coupe better
slip off on a by-path and trust to throwing them off
the scent theyll be on again in a moment

  ill do better than that replied the girl calmly

  she brought the car to a grinding halt reversed

and turned squarely around she threw over the
lever beside the seat and the coupe top folded down
out of sight leaving the car looking like an ordinary
open roadster thereupon she pulled out false num-
ber plates from under the seat hooked them over
the old ones and was back in the car in barely a
minute

  at the same instant the motor-cycle officer who
by good chance had not yet attempted to  touch the
unsubstantial cable image started to shove his ma-
chine under the obstruction to go on with the pursuit

  snatch it loose and pretend to run fleckner
directed me

  i jerked the end of the cable off the window-catch
and went through a pantomime of running profes-
sor fleckner threw my projected image across the
park green apparently dragging the cable after me

  ill get him you two go on shouted the pseudo
detective leaping from the cab

  he raced after my image pouring a stream of
automatic pistol bullets at it till fleckner ran it into
a thicket and dissolved the thing how long my sup-
posed pursuer beat about that bush in search of a
mirage i dont know for i had more important
matters on hand

  the fellow was barely out of the cab when it
leaped into full speed with the motor-cycle already
gaining on it in an effort to make up for lost time

  and around the next bend they barely avoided
collision with an open roadster containing apparently
a pair of middle-aged ladies to whom they accorded
hardly a glance as they swept by

chapter xv

a chamber of horrors

an hour later to our immense relief we wel-
comed miss stimson and priestley still in
l their outlandish disguises back into the safe
shelter of the laboratory immediately after meet-
ing their deluded pursuers they had turned off the
road over which they had been fleeing and worked
south over a circuitous route until they reached the
getty square garage where miss stimson had rented
the car a new interchangeable model that had ad-
mirably suited her purposes the false number-
plates she had made herself with card-board and a
little paint

  in returning the car disguised as she was she
avoided the garage-mans suspicion by saying that
she was bringing it back for her sister who had
rented it

  in the meantime as our following ray showed
the motor-cycle officer and the man in the cab ran on
for over a mile before they became convinced that
they had lost the scent then they turned back
looking for clues but of course in vain finally
they came to the point where they had dropped the
supposed central office man there the motor-
cycle officer left them and so did we for we saw no
profit in following them further

  priestley was too worn and exhausted with his
experience to talk at first fleckners man brought
him some food which he ate in silence then he
retired to the room he had been using and slept for
twelve hours straight

  meantime fleckner miss stimson and i took
treasures of tantalus



turns at watching the screens and resting but what-
ever action the chief men of the crime trust had
taken on priestleys escape had been put through
while we were distracted by the chase we never
did learn how chandler found out so soon the trick
that had been played on him by the time we got
him and tanner and the others back on the screen
whatever excitement it had caused had subsided or
been suppressed

  nevertheless we soon learned that appropriate
action had been started

  when priestley finally awoke about six the next
morning i had also just finished my last nap of the
night he followed me out into the laboratory
where fleckner sat in front of the screen which at
this hour in the morning showed nothing but a series
of pictures of still life-a choice assortment of
sleeping villains

  where is miss stimson i want to thank her
properly for rescuing me i was too groggy last
night were almost his first words

  i sent miss stimson home about an hour ago
said fleckner she insisted on watching with us
on and off all night and she was pretty well worn out
to begin with too excited to sleep i guess i
made her go home where she could get away from
the atmosphere for a while

  shes a remarkable young woman priestley de-
clared do you know ive paid so little attention
to her that at this moment i hardly know what her
face looks like she wears that confounded eye
shade all the time around here and has a veil on
whenever she goes out

  shes a good deal of a mystery fleckner ad-
mitted i dont suppose she explained to you what
connection she had with the chandler household in
the past

  no she told me only the barest details of how
she fooled judge tanner she said she knew chand-
lers housekeeper when she was a little girl and that
helped her in getting in what do you mean
fleckner related in detail what took place in
chandlers house when miss stimson entered it the
morning before

  strange isnt it was priestleys only comment
but i saw he was deeply disturbed and that he re-
sented fleckners innuendoes

  but come the professor demanded impatiently
what about you you have the story were most
anxious to hear what happened when they grabbed
you 

  priestley shuddered it was some minutes before
he answered when he did it was slowly falteringly
as a sufferer speaks between spasms of pain

  its an experience hard to talk about he said at
last what i have to tell wont help us much its
merely an exposition of what the crime trust will do
to a man when it gets him in its clutches

  he paused for a moment and then with visible
effort continued

  during all the time i was in their hands i saw
no one and talked to no one directly except the man
who let me go i saw him for a moment or two
only just before he left me and he was evidently so
disguised that i wouldnt recognize him again
theyre exceedingly clever in their disguises im
convinced that when they have to work together in
the open as when they robbed the trust company
they are disguised even from each other i havent

  the slightest idea where they kept me or how i got
there and came away

  to begin with i believe miss stimson has al-
ready told you that no  the man named gersten
whom the trust condemned as a traitor is or rather
was an old friend of mine we were chums in
college and for a time i was aigaged to his sister
but we broke the engagement by mutual agreement
and later she married paul tilford another close
friend of mine gersten became an electrical en-
gineer and has apparently been quite successful
his wife is an intimate friend of my sister so you
see how close is the tie between us and how great
a shock it was when i found not only that he was
a criminal but that he was about to be murdered

  it may be all right to view a prospective murder
impersonally especially when you feel that the world
will be better off with the victim out of the way but
instincts revolted against allowing it to go on and as
you remember i protested when i realized how
helpless i was in the matter and how much greater
things were at stake i gave in

  but when i found the victim was to be john
gersten i had to do something to think that he is
one of the criminal defectives and the others we
had discovered in the last few months it is ap-
palling it makes one wonder whom he can trust
the whole world seems crime mad under its smug
cover of conventional respectability it makes one
distrust his very self

  at any rate i rushed out from here and did the
utterly reckless thing of trying to call up and warn
gersten you know

  i came out of the phone booth and started down
the street i vaguely recall meeting a man who
passed me so closely that our elbows almost grazed
i was too preoccupied to notice him at all and
that instant i had a sudden dizzy feeling and then
everything went black thats all i know about my
kidnaping of course the man who passed me must
have sprayed an anesthetic in my face

  when i came to i was in total darkness and ab-
solute silence i might have been in an old-fashioned
grave for all i could tell in fact the close air added
to that impression i was lying on my back on what
seemed to be a slab of stone or concrete i tried to
move but found that my hands and feet were
shackled

  about my head was fastened some sort of con-
traption that seemed to consist mainly of pads over
my ears and mouth which i thought was to keep
me from hearing sounds or calling for help but i
was quickly undeceived

  following the instinct to call for help i tried to
cry out and to my surprise succeeded amazingly
i emitted a thunderous sound which seemed to be
concentrated in my own ears it nearly burst my
ear drums

  at that i heard a low chuckle i stiffened and
wrenched at my shackles but was unable to break-
free

   so you are awake are you priestrey some one
said in a low casual tone that came apparently from
right beside me i strained my eyes to see him but
couldnt make out the slightest outline in the dense
blackness

 no use yelling your head off or straining your-
self trying to break away the voice warned that
outfit on your head is a telephone receiver and trans-

mitter so that you can hear what we have to say and
tell us what we want to know thats your only

through which well feed you a little air if you want
to use it to talk with and talk right

   where am i  i demanded

  again came the taunting chuckle but somewhat
louder

   i cant give you the street and number very
well it isnt allowed but if itll be any consolation
to you i can tell you that youre in a strong alumi-
noid coffin buried under ten feet of earth in an un-
used subcellar im the only one in the world who
knows where you are and i own the building so
you can see what a lively chance of rescue you have

  for once in my life i nearly fainted away with
horror i believed instinctively that he was telling
the truth though i never got further proof of it
than his bare statement and my own impression of
my surroundings

   now whenever you are ready to tell us who
are the rest of your friends who think they know
some of our secrets i will listen and if what you tell
me is true your situation will be made easier for
you went on the voice

  just what i said in reply doesnt matter i gave
him to understand he had better kill me at once and
save his time as i wasnt the kind of yellow dog who
would find life tolerable after he had betrayed his
friends that wasnt as a matter of fact as heroic
as it sounds for i knew how badly they wanted to
know the names of their enemies they could gain
nothing by killing me for as long as they kept me
a prisoner i could do them no harm on the other
hand if they did kill me theyd lose their only present
chance of learning the names of those who were
endangering their whole organization if i gave
them the information theyd have no further use
for me and would doubtless promptly kill me i
knew they would try to keep me alive in the hope of
finally breaking down my resistance every moment
gained was giving you people so much more chance
of rescuing me i didnt realize the chances against
the rescue or the torture i would go through mean-
time or i think i would have wished to die right
then

  priestley paused and shuddered again at the recol-
lection of it

  did either of you ever happen to use that instru-
ment of misery the old-fashioned wired telephone
whose connections were made by hand at switch-
boards-one of those complicated contrivances gen-
erally out of order and at best working in most hap-
hazard fashion from which our fathers suffered a
century ago you may remember them as a boy
professor fleckner blair may have seen one in a
museum well when i was a youngster about fif-
teen i ran across a short line of that sort while
traveling with my father in a back-woods section of
northern alaska i remember well the mixture of
buzz clack and rattle that nearly split my ear-drums
while the so-called central was trying quite often
in vain to get a number with an especially violent
attack preceding her frequent announcement that the
line is busy

  well the telephone instrument that was attached
to my head had the same set of tricks whether
it was really an old-fashioned early-twentieth-century

  affair i dont know you have read of the ancient
practise of torturing prisoners by a steady drip drip
f water on the shaven skull or of the amiable art
of tickling a victim to death or driving him insane
by continuous light taps on the soles of his feet i
am sure i would have welcomed those methods-any
or all of them-in preference to that infernal crack-
ling in my ears that kept up hour after hour broken
only at intervals when my torturer paused to ask me
if i was ready to talk

  finally i seemed to lose all sense of hearing as
such each click of the instrument was marked by
a sharp pain that seemed to shoot through my skull
and down every nerve in my body to my very toes
i tottered on the verge of delirium but fought
against it with all my remaining will

  at last i must have lapsed into momentary un-
consciousness i came to again with a name on my
lips i knew that in my half-consciousness i had
spoken aloud the name of some acquaintance but
whose i did not know nor do i know now and i
am half crazy with the fear that i may in that instant
have betrayed one of you

  he stopped again and rubbed his head slowly like
a man still in a daze his face a picture of utter
misery fleckner and i looked at each other and
each read in the others face an uneasy echo of
priestleys fear

chapter xvi

the crime trust invokes the law

the rest of priestleys story made little im-
pression on me i was too absorbed in specu-
lation as to what he might have said in that
moment of half-delirium had we been betrayed
and could we expect at any moment some insidious
attack by the gang 

  i gathered half hearing that when priestley came
to with the unrecognized name on his lips the click-
ing of the telephone instrument had ceased it must
have been at about that moment that word came to
the watcher above his prison-grave to release him
for he became conscious of a sweetish suffocating
vapor evidently an anesthetic sent down through
the tube mentioned by his tormentor he lost con-
sciousness completely this time and did not recover
it again until he had been carried in the cab almost
to the point where he was let go

  his story completed he sat back exhausted and
listened apathetically to fleckner and myself discus-
sing our next steps the possibility that one or more
of our names in addition to priestleys was in the
possession of the crime trust was the most serious
thing to consider

  we were keeping the crime trust principals on the
screen as usual but recent events had made them
more than ever cautious and we gleaned nothing of
value as to their information and plans our chief
dread was that priestley had let slip the name of
professor fleckner in that case we could expect
an attack on the laboratory at any moment what
insidious form it would take we could not imagine
and hence could not prepare very intelligently to
meet it

  one thing was certain if fleckner had been be-
trayed and the secret of the telephonoscope dis-
covered by the trust our game was up
treasures of tantalus



    at the least i said we must all stay hidden
 here at the laboratory priestley certainly cant show
 his face in public until weve got this bunch nipped
 i advise keeping even your servants shut in on some
 pretext or other

   right fleckner agreed and we must use ex-
 treme caution in answering both the door and tele-
 phones ill have miss stimson stand guard over
 those matters

    but miss stimson is out priestley cried in sud-
 den alarm we must get her back at once they
 may have her name and be after her now

   he sprang for the telephone unmindful of his
 physical weakness

   fleckner made a move as if to stop him but im-
 mediately seemed to think better of it

    dont say whos calling he warned priestley in-
 stead i instructed her when i hired her to keep
 her employment absolutely secret

   miss stimson lived alone at an apartment hotel
 in a moment priestley had the desk clerk there on
 the phone and asked for her

    after listening to the clerks report he hung up
 and turned back to us his face even paler than be-
 fore

    they say she isnt there and hasnt been in her
 room for several days

   then theyve got her i exclaimed

    priestley sank into a chair and dropped his face
 in his hands too overcome to speak

    professor fleckner was lost in thought but said
 nothing and his masklike countenance betrayed 
 emotion

   the poor girl i exclaimed theyll torture
 her horribly there must be some way of rescuing
 her

 	ill give myself up in exchange priestley de-
 clared let me at the instrument

    he went to the switchboard of the telephonoscope
 and threw over the control lever professor fleck-
 ner watched him with a sardonic smile

   but to our bewilderment nothing happened in re-
 sponse to priestleys manipulation of the levers the
 screen remained blank

    fleckner chuckled

   it wont work will it he taunted you see
 i have noted that you boys didnt quite approve of
 my methods and might get rebellious so while you
 slept i changed the combination of the instrument so
 that no one but me can work it hereafter

   furthermore i had this apartment built over
 some years ago when i began making secret inven-
 tions i didnt propose to have my ideas stolen
 the doors and windows have secret electric locks
 steel bare that thrust across them out of the interior
 of the adjacent walls so that its as impossible to get
 out as in ive just pressed a secret button that puts
 those locks in operation ive also pressed another
 button ihat put our phone out of commission and
 another summoning james and his able assistant
 here they are

    into the laboratory came james the gigantic ex-
 athlete whom fleckner employed as butler and valet
 with him was another man equally competent-look-
 mg from a physical standpoint

    james said his employer some gentlemen on
 the outside are trying to get at our secrets or kidnap
 us or both ive told you a little about it already

ive thrown all the outside locks and cut off the
phone you may break the news to the cook he
will get his regular food supplies up the delivery tube
as usual and send back a written order for each day
so we wont starve these two young gentlemen are
friends of mine but dont quite agree with me just
now keep them under guard especially while they
are in the laboratory theyll have access to this
and their two bedrooms only you take the day
watch and john the night watch

  then he turned to us

  i think i understand some things a little better
than you boys he said i think i can guarantee
that miss stimson will suffer no serious harm be-
fore i rescue her i also think i can control the
crime trust pretty well from now on and i dont
propose to have any misguided interference

  priestley threw up his hands and gave in without
further words and i followed his example

  at that moment the newspaper delivery tube
clicked and dropped the morning papers on the table
back of us we each picked up one and sat down
to read not expecting much of interest in the news
that found its way into print it served rather as
a welcome distraction from the tension

  but on this particular morning we found that in-
stead of furnishing distraction the news bore vitally
on our troubles at last the crime trusts activities
had broken into public print

  not that the startling tales on the front pages
would reveal to the uninitiated the handiwork of that
evil coterie even i read for some distance into the
first item that caught my eye before i suspected it
the heavy three-column head ran

 twelve rich men vanish
        victims of kidnaping plot

  in the last twenty-four hours it seemed reports
had come to police headquarters one after the other
of the mysterious disappearance of a dozen of the
best known business  men or bankers in the city
ten of them had responded to mysterious telephone
calls at their offices hurrying out without any ex-
planations and saying they would be back within an
hour or so none of them had been seen or heard
of since

  the remaining two so office associates testified
had received calls of a mysterious nature to which
they had refused to respond one of them was
driving home from the theater that night when his
car was stopped by a pair of masked men in a quiet
spot he had been dragged out of his car and car-
ried off before his frightened family who were with
him realized what was happening

  the other had been called to his door just before
retiring by a thick-set bearded man as the butler
described him who refused to come in when the
master failed to return after some time the butler
went to the door to find him gone he had not been
heard of since

  i read the list of the victims over twice before its
significance dawned on me i had copied the list of
names on my memorandum pad in this very room
less than a year ago it was a complete catalogue
of the men fleckner had invited to witness the first
exhibition of the telephonoscope on that memorable
new years eve


amazing stories

   why i exclaimed this is the crime trusts
work theyve caught every man excepting our-
selves who knows anything at all of the existence of
the telephonoscope

   huh grunted fleckner oh you are reading
the other story i was reading the one on the right-
hand side of the page

   the old man had turned deadly pale i saw him
visibly frightened for the first time

   then before i could turn to the account that had
caused this remark i heard a groan from priestley
he too was staring at head- ines opposite the ones
that had just bowled me over i noted them now
for the first time and my own feelings were hardly
less acute than that of my companions

   this is what caught my eye

thomas priestley multimillionaire
flees justice after indictment

accused of obtaining huge fortune by fraud
he escapes officers after thrilling auto
race through city parks

   the crime trust defeated in its purpose to hold
priestley an illegal prisoner had laid a clever plot
and invoked the aid of the law against him

chapter xvii

 i

fleckner usurps the crime throne

priestley controlled himself with difficulty
while we read the two stories through ac-
cording to the second article a cousin of priest-
leys-evidently the one whose life we had saved
from the bolshevik outlaws on that pacific island last
new years eve-had just returned to civilization
after long isolation in the south seas he had
learned for the first time that thomas priestley held
the family fortune by virtue of the signatures of the
other descendants thereupon he had gone to the
district attorneys office and declared he had never
signed the release

   it was significant that he fell into the hands of
assistant district attorney winter accredited mem-
ber of the crime trusts inner councils winter in-
vestigated the alleged signature of the returned
cousin on the release document and his expert had
pronounced it a forgery moreover it was shown
that on the date the signature was signed december
  the cousin was in the south seas and the
paper had been filed long before it could possibly
have reached new york from there the reader
will remember that this cousin like the other two
signed the projected shadow of the release and that
the signature was actually recorded by a photo-
graphic process on real paper in new york

   the grand jury being in session an indictment
had been jammed through immediately and an order
for arrest obtained priestley not being found in
his usual haunts and not having been seen there for
several days a general alarm had been sent out for
him a detective had seen him that noon getting into
a car with a heavily veiled young woman whose
identity was unknown he had summoned help and
given chase

   then a strange thing had happened proof of a
carefully worked out conspiracy the story went on

to tell how the detectives had been foiled by a heavy
cable stretched across the road

  it was a plausible tale and sensational in the ex-
treme it not only ruined priestleys reputation both
by direct statements and countless cleverly put and
evidently inspired innuendoes but from a legal stand-
point seemed to present a pretty clear case against
him that could be contested only by exposing the
secret of the telephonoscope which in the present
circumstances would do more harm than good

  further than that the only persons who could
testify as to the genuineness of the signature of
priestleys cousin barring fleckner priestley and
myself had been kidnaped so that nothing of that
sort would interfere with the trusts plans i pointed
this out to fleckner

  and in addition to that-i went on if they
knew enough about us to capture all the men who are
in the secret they certainly know your connection
with it and will be after us at once i only wonder
they havent been here already

  quite so fleckner agreed their delay is prob-
ably caused by the necessity for keeping such moves
secret well well prove an alibi as far as this place
is concerned

  james he directed tell the cook to order
enough food staples sent up this morning to last
about a month together with the canned and con-
centrated supplies we have on hand then you bring
a couple of trunks and a bag out here and you and
john and the cook put on your own things and get
your valises then call up and have a big motor
hack down at the door in half an hour tell them
we want to catch the ten thirty at the pennsylvania
station

  priestley looked up in amazed alarm

  youre not going to attempt to leave he ex-
claimed and keep me locked up here alone
keep your seat thomas fleckner reassured
him im going to do nothing of the sort the
management of the building and the crime trust
sleuths are simply going to think they see us depart-
ing oh by the way james-also call up the super-
intendent and tell him were going away for a month
or so taking a trip down through the andes or any
other remote place that sounds good to you

  a half-hour later fleckner turned on the tele-
phonoscope and got the front entrance of the build-
ing on the screen the motor hack he had ordered
stood waiting fleckners two men brought one of
the trunks in front of the screen and went through
the motions of walking while the professor turned
on the projector and sent their images out into the
hall down the elevator and out to the hac he held
the image of the trunk in the hack while with an-
other ray he brought the images of the men back up
to the laboratory to go through the motions with the
other trunk

  then all four of us carrying bags were projected
in image down aboard the hack fleckner told the
chauffeur to draw down the curtains and drive to
the pennsylvania station the professor kept our
images and those of the trunks and bags aboard the
hack all the way to the station

  this is on my account at the livery he said to
the driver on the hacks arrival at the station he
could not of course satisfy the man with shadow
money by the way while im having the baggage
treasures of tantalus



taken in would you mind telephoning for me ive
just time to catch the train call up the superin-
tendent of my building and tell him that my attorney
mr forsyth will attend to my rent while im gone
i forgot to tell him add a dollar for yourself to
my bill

  this of course was mere by-play to get the driver
away long enough to dissolve our images without
causing him undue astonishment

  all this -time fleckner had kept another ray play-
ing about watching for trailers of the hack but if
the trust had any emissaries watching our supposed
movements we failed to catch them at it

  well fleckner said at last it looks as if we
were all snug and could defy the trust indefinitely
if they try breaking in here illegally theyll get an
unpleasant surprise if they try invoking the law
through a permit to secure evidence i have another
sort of surprise

  as for your case priestley dont worry about it
i will arrange to have no further action taken on it
until you are caught which will be never unless i
see fit when were good and ready provided you
make me no more trouble well clear your name in
such spectacular fashion that therell be no doubt left
in the public mind

  do you mind telling us how you expect to ac-
complish all these marvels priestley asked rather
sarcastically

   youll see little by little the professor replied
imperturbably from now on i am the real head
of the crime trust im going to rule with a lightning
rod im going to stand it on its head and all not
without profit to myself for the treasure of tan-
talus is mine to have and to hold

  priestley and i remained silent we had learned
by now the unwisdom of arguing with him there
was a wild almost mad gleam in the old mans eyes
i wondered if the vision of too much power had
unbalanced his reason or had we in our desire to
root the hidden criminals from society put ourselves
in the hginds of a master criminal 

  priestley and i often discussed these questions
cautiously between ourselves during the coming
weeks when we were alone together in one of our
rooms and were sure the old man was preoccupied
with his screen

  and as the days went evidence piled up that this
old genius who had so enthusiastically started on the
hunt for high-grade defectives had himself devel-
oped a defective streak i began to wonder more
than ever who of us was immune from this obscure
mental malady there were times when i found
myself applying tests to myself to see if i was mor-
ally normal

  all that day after fleckner had put his house in
order for a possible siege he sat by his desk in deep
thought now and then making notes on a pad dur-
ing that time he made no use at all of the tele-
phonoscope he was evidently as we came to learn
later planning out the details of one of the most
ambitious bids for power that the world has ever
known a campaign that had for its aim the sub-
jection of society holding its privacy for ransom

  at six oclock that evening he sprang suddenly into
action he retired to his bedroom for a moment and
when he returned we were amazed to see him attired
ln a black robe and mask like those worn in the
crime trusts secret clubroom

  im going to pay some of my new subjects a
visit he remarked casually as he sat down at the
telephonoscope switchboard

  he then switched on the ray by a new and com-
plicated combination derice of which we could make
nothing though we watched closely at once the
private dining-room at the riccadona was on the
screen then we sat and waited

  a half-hour later judge tanner dorgan and win-
ter entered they removed their overcoats and sat
down they had just turned to their menu cards
when professor fleckner arose turned on his pro-
jector and clapped his hands

  the trio of rascals at the little table miles away
leaped to their feet in startled amazement just as
the heavy draperies of one of the windows seemed to
melt silently into the frames and a black-robed
masked figure stepped off the sill and stood before
them

  pray sit down gentlemen dont be alarmed
he commanded in a good imitation of the hoarse
whisper tanner had heard so many times over the
secret telephone circuit

  the three obeyed pale and shaken

  i am the man higher up before you in person
at last announced the apparition solemnly i
never expected to give you a personal interview here
you remember i said to you judge tanner on elec-
tion night that i would like very much to thank you
in person but that it was not possible you and mr
dorgan made it clear when you initiated mr winter
here that it wasnt done

  the three winced at hearing their names pro-
nounced in this offhand manner they had evidently
believed that the man higher up was as ignorant of
their identity as they were of his

  priestley and i standing behind the black-robed
figure of the real fleckner and peering over at his
projected image on the screen hardly dared breathe
lest the slightest sound from us be likewise projected
into the tense atmosphere of the little dining-room
miles away and mar the illusion the professor was
creating

  but new conditions have arisen the black-robed
image went on while his hearers their first terror
subsiding stared at the blank mask in hypnotized
fascination somewhere in this carefully worked
out organization a leak has sprung it has proven
so mysterious and baffling that i dared not use our
regular indirect methods in conducting a conference
so i am here though you will appreciate the wisdom
of my concealing my personality

  in the first place judge tanner dont use this
secret telephone circuit again im afraid its un-
safe recent events make me think some of our
telephone communications have been tapped when
i need to confer with you ill call you on the regular
telephone at your home or your chambers and simply
ask has there been a decision in that last case
yet you will simply answer that there has not and
hang up

  then you will come immediately to this room
ill be here when you have orders to transmit to
your helpers below ill see that they get there im
explaining to them also that they must not use the
phones for organization business till this mystery
has been cleared up	

  priestley and i looked at each other unwilling
admiration in our faces at one clever stroke


amazing stories

fleckner had cut chandler off from all communica-
tion with the crime trust of which he had been the
head

  now the apparition went on ive decided on
a different course toward the prisoners we are hold-
ing well have no executions and no more tortures
well keep them comfortable make each one think
some one else has confessed and promise him immu-
nity if hell corroborate the confession

  prisoners tanner asked finding his voice for
the first time we have only one prisoner-gersten
-and i was about to report to you to-night that
weve proved him innocent and ask your permission
to release him

  ah fleckner exclaimed im glad to hear it
release him by all means by prisoners i meant
also priestley i forgot for a moment i had not yet
told you my special corps has just recaptured him
so we are safe from him personally but he has
friends we must catch by the way winter let that
indictment lie idle until i give the word i may
decide to have it quashed have you learned any-
thing new as to the methods by which our secrets
are leaking out or how priestley escaped

  not a thing tanner admitted we are still
absolutely in the dark

  didnt priestley make any remark under torture
that could give you a clue  pursued the pseudo crime
trust chief

  tanner looked distinctly uncomfortable and hesi-
tated

  i trust you are not trying to conceal anything
fleckner went on sharply

  i wont conceal anything tanner admitted but
first may i beg immunity from the usual punishment
for having obtained forbidden knowledge i cant
believe anyhow that what priestley said was true
priestley clutched my arm convulsively we were
about to learn what my friend had revealed in his
delirium that half-remembered shouting of a name
which haunted him ever since with the fear that he
had betrayed one of us

  have no fear fleckner consoled tanner this
is an unusual occasion we must grasp at any straw
of information we can get ill see that all precedent
is waived in this case

  well then tanner faltered the young man
shouted once just as he was coming out of a semi-
delirious stupor brought on by his suffering the
attendant heard him clearly so theres no mistake
mortimer chandler president-elect of the united
states is the real head of the crime trust is what
he said

chapter xviii

chandler springs a surprise

professor fleckner started visibly at
this announcement that priestley in his deli-
rium had revealed to the members of the crime
trust the carefully guarded name of their mysterious
chief priestley and i as well as the three uneasy
figures around the table in the little dining-room
waited breathlessly for his reply

  he was not quick to make it for some moments
he stood in silence evidently debating how he should
meet this unexpected situation at length he spoke
solemnly deliberately

  it has been our policy neither to affirm nor to
deny guesses as to the identity of any of our mem-
bers but to punish swiftly those who venture to
guess this case is different i feel that i should set
you right

  i am troubled to know that young priestley has
learned so much as to guess rightly at the existence
of our secret organization and that we are interested
in mortimer chandler whom for our purposes we
have put up for president of the united states for
the rest of his delirious statement while he was
buried alive and under nerve racking torture its at
most a very bad guess chandler and i are not one
and the same person at all nor does he even dream
who i am i am head of the crime trust as our
prisoner was pleased to call it therefore chandler
is not thats all for now follow my instructions
and ill appoint another meeting soon

  his image backed to the window again the drap-
eries seemed to melt and he vanished he threw
off the projector snatched off his black mask and
turned to us wiping beads of sweat from his face

  well he remarked with great satisfaction ive
spiked chandlers guns and found out what i wanted
to know the gentlemen of the crime trust havent
learned a thing about the telephonoscope and never
will for every one who knows anything about it is
safely out of their reach

  but priestley protested in bewilderment what
about miss stimson and the twelve men who were
present at the demonstration on new years eve  i
thought we were satisfied they were in the power of
the trust  have they escaped 

  you mean you were satisfied fleckner chuckled
i might as well tell you about that now they have
not escaped they were never kidnaped by the trust
for the simple reason that i took good care that they
shouldnt be by kidnaping them first myself

  what i exclaimed do you mean to say that
all this time you have known where miss stimson
was 

  exactly he agreed miss stimson never left
this building that night i said i sent her home while
you and priestley slept nor has she since she is
perfecdy safe and comfortable though rather closely
confined you see i rent four adjoining apartments
in this house the twelve missing gentlemen are
here also ten of them came unsuspectingly in re-
sponse to my telephone invitation of which the
papers spoke the other two dallied so they had to
be carried here by my two men james and john
incidents whjch the papers also told about luridly
the safety of all of us depended on such precautions
to say nothing of the success of my future plans
the feelings of priestley and myself were too
mixed to allow us to speak we stared at the pro-
fessor in amazed silence then another suggestion
intruded itself in my mind

  and the disappearance of the two-million-dollar
treasure van after chandler was scared off was
that also engineered by you  i asked

  exactly he agreed when we were watching
chandler on his way to meet the treasure van i had
john and james-who by the way are expert aero-
nauts-in a swift plane of mine in my hangar on
the roof of this building ready to fly to the spot the
moment chandler revealed to us the hiding-place of
the main treasure when i saw there was no hope
that chandler or any agent of his would dare try to
treasures of tantalus



go back to the van after he was frightened by miss
stimson i decided i wouldnt let an unclaimed treas-
ure even a paltry two million dollars lie around idle
so after you and priestley were asleep i directed
the boys to fly out and retrieve the van and take it
to a good hiding-place of my own where it now
lies safe

  this coasting confession too priestley and i re-
ceived in silence i remember wondering at this in
priestleys case such a sharp contrast to his usual
vehement protests against fleckners doubtful meth-
ods which now had passed quite beyond the doubt-
ful stage i was disturbed too by my own
acquiescence

  i no longer had any doubts that fleckner had
passed into the ranks of pronounced criminal defec-
tives what disturbed me almost as much was the
fear that priestley and myself were to some degree
infected with the germs of the same defectiveness

  professor fleckner was now busy with further
plans after consulting his notes and spending a
few minutes in thought he turned again to the tele-
phonoscope control board and brought the home of
mortimer chandler on the screen chandler was
shown alone in his study hard at work over some
reports a hasty search about the house with the
rays made it apparent that the family and his secre-
tary were out for the evening the servants were
in their own quarters in a distant part of the house

  a very opportune moment for visiting my prede-
cessor on the crime trust throne and letting him
know he is out of office chuckled the professor
also i may add this is the evening in which i take
over officially the custody of the treasures of
tantalus

  he slipped on his black mask again got a heavy
automatic pistol from the storeroom which he held
conspicuously before him stepped in front of the
screen and threw on the projector

chandler bent over the papers at his desk
heard a soft step and looked up to find himself
face to face with the black-robed masked image that
had so startled the council of three a little while
before

  the president-elect leaped to his feet his face
showing amazement and anger rather than fright

  who the devil are you and how did you get in 

  quiet stand where you are dont press any
call-buttons if any one finds us together youll die
first he next fleckner rapped out sit down
over in that chair out of reach of push-buttons

  chandler obeyed as any reasonable man would
but he still showed no sign of fear he already
had himself in hand and was eyeing the apparent
intruder cooly

  thats better the apparition went on dont
be alarmed you wont suffer the slightest harm if
you are reasonable as you will be im sure when
ive shown you that your life and reputation are
entirely in my hands

  now as to your questions to answer the sec-
ond one first i got in by a method i shall use often
from now on for it will be necessary for us to
confer frequently

  and who am i  well we dont name names
as a rule in our organization do we  ill just keep
mine to myself as you have kept yours till now i
am however a member of the secret organization of

which you have been the head a member who was
not afraid to use his brains and inquire into things
instead of blindly taking orders

  i have located you for instance and can expose
you at will if i choose i know the machinery of
the organization from a to z i have in my pos-
session a complete list of the members and records
of every order you have issued for a year back
where you have allowed a leak to break out in the
system which nearly wrecked it i have found the
leak stopped it and altered the system so that you
can no longer handle it and i can

  in short i am the new head of the organization
and have come here tonight to announce my as-
sumption of leadership and offer to retain you as
my first lieutenant provided you are amenable to
reason

  my admiration for the poise of chandler increased
as i watched him while fleckner pronounced this
remarkable mixture of truth and fiction there was
not the slightest flicker of expression in his face as
he replied

  this is very interesting he said with sneering
emphasis some secret fraternity i suppose and
this is the rather original and startling method of
installing a new officer i fancy you had a little
too much to drink and got in the wrong house
otherwise i havent the remotest notion of what
you are talking about now just go out quietly the
way you came and well overlook it this time

  eleckners answer was to draw a packet of photo-
graphic prints from a pocket of his robe his
counterfeit image seemed to lay them on chandlers
table at the same time keeping the automatic ready
with the other hand he picked up the prints one
by one and held them before chandlers face

  there was a photograph of chandler in his tele-
phone booth followed by a close-up of the mechanism
of the secret circuit and a picture of the council of
three in the private room at the riccadona judge
tanner at the phone taking chandlers orders sev-
eral views of the underground clubroom followed

  there were photos of the robbing of the trust
company showing chandlers part in it from start to
finish there were views of the counterfeiting
plant under the cotton mill at fall river and others
showing how the bogus money reached chandler

  it was a pretty complete and unanswerable argu-
ment chandlers eyes widened a little as he watched
the pictured story unfold but otherwise he showed
no signs of emotion

  now fleckner announced as he slipped the
prints back in his pocket in addition to this i have
phonograph records of the conversation that went
with these photographs so there isnt much evidence
lacking i have other photos too if you arent sat-
isfied yet

  i must be brief and get away before i am inter-
rupted he went on when chandler made no sign
in a nutshell the situation is this i have learned
the system by which you held your power that
alone ends your usefulness as head of the organiza-
tion further certain outsiders began to get a clue
to your system of communication with subordinates
you know that already that renders that system
useless ive therefore been around and established
a new system which i know and you dont ive
explained to the leaders that the old is unsafe and


amazing stories

that they must acknowledge no more orders over
it so you are entirely cut off and helpless

  still further i have built up my own secret inner
circle of assistants within the organization and
broken up yours as you will learn if you try to give
any more orders

  now not a man but you and me know that the
headship of the organization has changed and
they wont know you will be surprised to learn
though that one of your recent prisoners knew you
by name for the head of the organization and under
torture told it

  for the first time chandler showed signs of
alarm

  i thought that would startle you fleckner
laughed well dont worry as long as you obey
me i have assured them the prisoner was crazy
and altogether in error meantime i have put the
fellow where he will do no harm unless i choose but
mark me if you are rebellious i have only to ex-
pose you and the old machinery you controlled and
go right on with the new one i have created will
you act as assistant and obedient adviser to me or
face disgrace and residence at ossining farm 

  chandler stood in thought for some moments
he was now controlling his emotions with evident
effort

  you have me he admitted at last i yield
theres nothing else to do what do vou wish
first 

  theres only one thing to-night said fleckner
triumph in his voice and that is to complete the
transfer of authority bv turning over the custodv of
the secret treasure

  chandler was studying him curiously as he said
this his own face had become a complete mask
again

  i noticed that you had no photo of the big trea-
sure chest i suspect that you with all your knowl-
edge know no more about the treasures hidine-
place than i

  what do you mean  fleckner demanded
sharply

  i mean that youve made the natural mistake of
assuming that i was the ultimate man higher up i
was not i was head of the working organization
it is true but above me was the only man who
knows the secret of the treasury i havent the re-
motest idea who he is or where he keeps the treas-
ure

          chapter xix
          a reign of terror

for long minutes after chandlers almost cat-
astrophic announcement that his overthrower
had not yet reached his goal chandler and
fleckners image faced each other in intense defiant
silence

  it was a poker game with wealth and power im-
measurable at stake the spectacle of a napoleon
wagering with the devil his soul against the dominion
of hell but i defy any mortal man to have read
in the mask of stone that was chandlers face
whether he was risking his last vestige of power and
self-respect on a royal flush or a pure bluff

  fleckner uncertain wavered and lost

  very well he said at length ill let your

statement go as it stands for the present if it is
true you and i are equal now as far as the treasure
goes in the end  will conquer its secret and deal
with its guardian as i have with you at least he
will receive no further tribute from the crime trust
and wield no more power over that organization
if you have lied  will soon know it and i will
handle you without mercy

  he paused impressively

  do you wish to alter your statement in any way
he added

   not in the least chandler responded colorlessly
i have told you the truth make the most of it

  very well then fleckner said finally well
meet again soon good night

  chandler made no reply he stood silently watch-
ing the black mirage of fleckner until it passed from
his sight through the door into the hall and there
vanished into the air he made no attempt to follow
it or to investigate how this supposedly material
being had gained entrance

  instead he sank into his chair and for an hour
sat bowed head in his hands his iron self-control
abandoned once he believed himself without an audi-
ence finally he arose and staggered into his bed-
chamber a man suddenly stricken with age

  meantime professor fleckner was raging about
the laboratory like a caged lion robbed of his meal
he seemed oblivious to our presence

  was the man lying how can i prove it
i reasure of i antalus indeed slipped away again
but  get it yet meantime theyll pay through
the nose he muttered as he paced the floor

   i believe this final disappointment and his baffled
tage was the ultimate blow that broke down the last
inhibitions of his gradually warping moral nature
even his normally powerful intellect seemed for a
time unbalanced

  at any rate priestley and i were doomed to sit
helplessly by and witness at its evil source the devel-
opment and spread of a world-wide reign of terror
-a period when no man felt safe against the public
revelation of his most private words and acts or
the contents of his most secret documents-when
most carefully guarded money and securities were
stolen the thief betraying uncanny knowledge of the
secret measures of protection family skeletons
were rattled in the ears of wealth till large sums
were despatched to mysterious sources to buy silence
secret business pacts were laid bare sending the
stock market rocketing skyward or plunging to the
depths political intrigues were unfolded for the
benefit of rival parties and all these infernal ac-
tivities priestley and i knew emanated from the
mind of professor fleckner through the control-
board of his miraculous telephonoscope

  in the mean time this evil wonder-worker was
reported as being seen and interviewed in various
sections of south america through which continent
he was believed to be making an airplane tour the
crafty professor thus maintained an alibi by pro-
jecting his image to one of those points everv few
days

  he no longer took us into his confidence he
made no objection to our watching his screen when
we wished but some of his most spectacular coups
were performed while we slept we followed them
mainly through the sensational newspaper stories
that appeared each morning for the papers were
treasures of tantalus



delivered through the tube regularly fleckner had
taken care not to order these stopped when he made
his pretense of closing his apartment and going
abroad

  he must have worked the larceny squad of the
crime trust overtime and have taken no pains to
conceal the robberies by replacing the stolen money
with counterfeit as in the case of the theft we had
witnessed in the trust company vaults hardly a
morning passed in which the papers did not feature
a series of widely scattered bank hauls

  a rival inventor of fleckners dr hayward
bernstorm was manufacturing a superior quality of
dye by a secret process which he had not entrusted
to the patent office only the inventor knew the
vital part of the ingredients administering the final
touches with his own hand to each batch of the
product the only written formula lay in a safe-
deposit vault in one of new yorks most substantial
banks yet suddenly another chemical concern in
which i happened to know fleckner was a large
stockholder began to manufacture the dye by the
same process the owner of the secret sued the
bank for allowing access to the safety-deposit box
by an unauthorized person

  but the secret formula was found intact and
apparently undisturbed and there was no valid evi-
dence that any one but its owner had seen it the
suit was lost

  a man prominent in new york social and finan-
cial circles made a scurrilous and as it turned out
mistaken statement about a business rival it was
made only to the makers wife in strictest confidence
in the privacy of their apartments the next day
he was sued for slander the complainant stated
in court that an unknown stranger had stepped up
to him on the street and quoted the slanderous re-
mark even the wife of the defendant apparently
voluntarily though weeping and reluctant appeared
on the stand and corroborated the evidence against
her husband

  she explained that she did so because she had
received an anonymous letter threatening that if she
refused an unfortunate but supposedly secret inci-
dent in her own recent career would be exposed
no evidence as to who this mysterious blackmailer
was appeared of course but fleckner reminded us
as he chuckled over the newspaper account that the
defendant in the slander suit had once disputed in
the papers a public statement of the professors

  in similar fashion fleckner vented his personal
spleen in many directions in other instances he
seemed to have no personal interest other than the
gratification of his whimsical humor or a display of
power

thus when a serious dispute arose between the
shop council of employees and the rrianage-
ment of the united states airplane company each
side held a series of secret conferences in its efforts
to get the best of the other that is why they tried
to hold secret conferences unfortunately the pa-
pers each morning published detailed reports of the
meetings of each side as a result each organiza-
tion was ruptured by a wrangle in which every one
accused every one else of breaking faith

  there was panic in the political world when after
each secret caucus of party leaders preparatory to

organizing the coming congress the papers of the
other parties published full reports of the proceed-
ings

  and these mysterious revelations of secrets spread
to international circles the plottings of a circle of
berlin royalists who aimed to restore the german
monarchy was revealed to the republican govern-
ment just before the coup was to be sprung on the
other hand the minutes of the executive sessions
of the council of the league of nations suddenly
began to be printed in full in the papers without any
official sanction and as a result an effort to make
certain delicate readjustments in the far east in
favor of japan had to be abandoned

  such are only a few of thousands of incidents
picked at random from the reign of terror that
accompanied these mad attacks on the privacy of the
world of course some good did spring out of this
evil certain revelations of business and political
chicanery resulted in making business men and poli-
ticians alike more straightforward in their dealings
for a long time to come when it finally dawned on
the public that some mysterious spy system was ren-
dering thick walls distance and darkness of no avail
in the keeping of secrets

  a newspaper humorist revived the fable of the
little black man who went about prying and tell-
ing secrets presently it ceased to be a joke the
sophisticated were convinced that some clever black-
mailing agency was at work those inclined to be
superstitious became positively so all shared in the
panic no man knew when his most secret act or
word might-not be publicly quoted to his detriment

  men lost confidence in banks and in business en-
terprises as the secret drain into professor fleckners
coffers continued unchecked

  as this proceeded i continued to wonder vaguely
why priestley and i were no more actively indignant
at what we witnessed or why we were not earnestly
plotting measures to thwart this new archvillain
priestley shared my wonder in the same vague way
and we discussed it occasionally in half-hearted fash-
ion we seemed to sleep or doze heavily most of
the time and to be in a semistupor even when awake

one day while we two were at luncheon to-
gether priestley accidentally upset his cup of
coffee before he had tasted it he wiped up the
mess and did not ask james who waited on us for
another cup that afternoon instead of dozing
about in his chair as usual and as i did he was wide
awake

  he walked restlessly about and chaffed me for my
drowsiness late in the afternoon he paused in
front of my chair as i roused myself from one of
my frequent naps and declared that hed give a good
part of the treasure of tantalus for the cup of
coffee he had spilled at noon

  i never realized what a slave i had become to
that drink he complained

  i showed no interest in his habits suddenly his
face lighted he shook me by the shoulders

  wake up and listen he exclaimed ive got it
now theyve put drugs in our coffee right along
to keep us doped and tractable

  and that proved to be the truth after that we
emptied our coffee cups in our wash-bowls when our
attendant was out of the room and straightway


amazing stories

our chronic drowsiness and lack of moral sensitive-
ness vanished we took good care to conceal this
change from fleckner and to watch his manipula-
tions of the revised crime trust machinery with re-
newed interest

  the professor had now wearied of bank robberies
and was using the crime trust agents as collectors
in a continuous series of blackmailing enterprises
with his malicious rays he followed the sun around
the globe keeping all the civilized world in constant
terror

   in addition he was steadily widening the influence
of his agents in the big business corporations of the
world by crafty use of his knowledge of inside his-
tory he alternated this with busy schemes for pro-
moting liberal legislation in the parliaments of the
world and in the council of the league of nations
he was wielding a power such as chandler in his
wildest moments never dreamed of

  as for the president-elect of our country he was
destined for some time to hold no more conferences
with the black-robed phantom that had usurped his
place that first visitation had been too much for
him chandler took to his bed next day with a
severe attack of nervous prostration and eventually
was declared physically impotent to assume the office
to which he had been elected hence on march 
vice-president horace kildare was inaugurated in
his place

  this turn of events irritated fleckner the more
he intended wresting from chandler the details of
how he turned the loot of the trust over to the real
custodian of the treasure and from that starting-
point he would trace down its hiding-place and its
keeper for in the midst of all his multifarious
activities fleckner never lost sight of his chief object
to get his clutches upon that enormous accumulation
of years of successful plunder

  one evening shortly after inauguration when
priestley and i were alone in my room and had made
certain that the professor was busy manipulating
society priestley confided to me that he had at last
deciphered the new combination of the telephono-
scope at work by cautiously watching fleckner at
work

   ill get a chance some day before long to use it
he said im going to end all this ill connect
with the district attorney and tell our story what
if  do sacrifice myself and my fortune this cant
go on

  far into the night we discussed plans for carrying
out this scheme the main difficulty was to get at
the telephonoscope without being blocked by fleck-
ner or one of his two men

  the chance came by mere accident a week later
james who had the watch at the time had brought in
the dinner trays for all four of us something
proved to be missing and he returned to the kitchen
for it fleckner at the moment was bent over his
note with his back to us priestley acting on sud-
den inspiration reached over and quietly changed
our coffee cups around that evening fleckner and
james drank the drugged coffee half an hour later
the worthy pair were asleep in their chairs

   at length priestley after testing the soundness of
their slumbers went triumphantly to the control
board of the telephonoscope successfully worked the
combination and a moment later the screen glowed
with the ray in full action then he seized the

directing lever and turned the ray in the direction of
the home of the district attorney

  now for the end of the crime trust he whis-
pered excitedly

chapter xx

the voice from nowhere

the district attorney of new york county
lived in a handsome apartment in upper river-
side drive the brilliant lights of that thor-
oughfare flashed across the screen as priestley ran
his ray along the higher house numbers until he came
to the one he sought then just inside he pro-
jected his own image and advanced it across the big
tapestried hajl to the desk and announced that mr
thomas priestley wished to see the district attorney

  the hall attendant got the sensation of his life
fie was a reader of the newspapers to have an
indicted criminal of prominence who had effected
an escape that had been a sensation for weeks calmly
walk in for a social call on the prosecutor after all
hope of catching him had been abandoned was too
much the young man stared at priestley incredu-
lously for a moment then gathered his wits and in
a frightened voice announced the visitor through
the phone after an awe-struck moment he re-
ported to- priestley that the district attorney was in
and would see him

  eightieth floor apartment twenty- he began

but his voice was drowned as far as we were con-
cerned by a sudden whirring roar the screen went
blank save for a pale yellow glow that showed the
ray was still on but that it was registering no images

  the roar penetrated even fleckners drugged con-
sciousness and he awoke with a start

  whats this whats this he demanded jump-
ing up what are you boys doing

  the machine seems to have run wild we were
trying to stop it i hastily lied

  the combination has been tampered with who
did that fleckner demanded leaping for the con-
trol-board

  you must have left it on when you went to sleep
i found it that way when i heard the roar and came
out of my room priestley ventured ably seconding
my mendacious efforts

  but now fleckner was struggling with the levers
and for the time paid no attention to us he confi-
dently threw off the power switch and examined the
intricate network of wires he seemed to find no
trouble then he threw on the power again and the
roaring was renewed again the screen glowed pale
yellow he tried manipulating the ray but got no
results nothing appeared on the screen and the
roaring continued

  again he studied every detail of his mechanism
wiring control-board power-cables and transform-
ers

  i can only guess that some big terrestrial electric
disturbance has interfered with the ray and has put
it temporarily out of control he ventured at length
a most interesting phenomenon

  he sat up the rest of the night making various
tests and setting down extensive notes on the phe-
nomenon which i confess interested priestley and
me but little we were too disgruntled at the loss
of our opportunity to communicate with the outside
world
treasures of tantalus



  i wondered grimly how long the district attorney
stood waiting eagerly to greet the man he had sought
all over the world and what happened to the nervous
system of the hall attendant when he saw that amaz-
ing hero melt into the thinnest air before his eyes

  but just before daybreak our interest in the
vagaries of the telephonoscope suddenly awakened
for some time that roar as of the tumult of many
waters had been slowly dying down first a cataract
then a rill then the low drone of distant rain and
finally the faint sighing of a summer breeze fol-
lowed by silence

  as the sound faded the light on the screen grew
gradually in strength till it was a bright glow for
a moment it became an intense white light then
slowly dimmed till it resembled the last faint flush
of a sunset afterglow

  fleckner had for the moment given up his investi-
gation at a loss what to do next we sat all four
of us staring curiously at the screen which after
doing our bidding so long had suddenly turned rebel
then into the hushed stillness of the room there
came from the screen the sound of a human voice
a soft girlish voice of ineffable sweetness singing
an eery haunting melody

  for long moments we sat breathless enchanted
the song rose and fell now near now distant like
music borne over wide waters on a fitful breeze it
haunts me yet after all these years

  i make no attempt to reproduce it here none of
us were musically trained we kept a phonographic
record of it but musical composers who have since
listened to that record found that the melody did not
conform to conventional scales and it defied their
efforts to record it on paper and reproduce it from
notes with anything approximating the original ef-
fect the words too though pronounced slowly
and with beautifully clear enunciation meant noth-
ing to us and their syllables defied all attempts to
record them by any alphabetical symbols with which
we were familiar

but meantime our efforts were bent on trying to
locate the strange singer in this priestley and
i took a lively interest on our part it was in a
measure idle curiosity and relief at this welcome
change from the sordid drama we had been witness-
ing an anodyne to our disappointment at not being
able to communicate with the outside world but
more particularly we were enthralled by that voice
and consumed with desire to see the singer

  and yet mingled with that desire i was conscious
of a certain dread of the revelation i do not know
if it be possible for a man to fall genuinely in love
with a woman from having merely heard her voice
i have never made a study of the amorous psychol-
ogy of the blind but i do know that the voice of
this strange woman moved me deeply and i dreaded
seeing her face lest it destroy the illusion 

  priestley and i exchanged no confessions on this
score but i noted with a foolish feeling almost akin
to jealousy that his manner indicated a feeling even
stronger than mine

  i thought suddenly of miss stimson and became
perversely indignant at him i have admitted that
my momentary glimpse of the violet eyes of that
young woman had intrigued my susceptible and
rather fickle heart my admiration for her sub-
sequent conduct had deepened the sentiment dan-

gerously i had tried to stifle it however con-
vinced that her heart was pledged to unrequited
affection for priestley i had believed that he held
for her no feeling but a kind of impersonal gratitude
for saving his life his ready interest in the voice
of this unknown young woman made me sure of it
and as i say i was unreasonably indignant

  but while we youngsters were thus mooning about
the room fleckner forgetting for a moment all
sordid and utilitarian considerations was lost in a
problem of pure science

  this pet invention of his of whose every whim
he had supposed himself master had suddenly dis-
played a new trait he must learn its secret

  the dominion of the world and the treasure of
tantalus could wait once more for the moment
the master criminal was the calm cold devotee of
the intellect

  the song ceased a few minutes after we first
heard it but the light stayed on the screen showing
that the ray was still active and it seemed to re-
main focused on one region for at intervals through-
out the day we heard the song again now far and
now near but always the same words once when
the song came from a point so close to the fore-
ground of the ray focus that it seemed the singer
must be in the room itself just behind the screen
the singer stopped abruptly in the midst of the re-
frain then in a melodious speaking voice she
pronounced a few rapid words she was answered
by a heavy though not unpleasant masculine tone
a lively dialogue followed for a few minutes then
silence again

  its most baffling fleckner admitted i pride
myself on my knowledge of languages but i catch
no syllable that seems to bear any relation to the
european family of tongues

  means nothing to me either priestley declared
ive picked up in my travels a smattering of vari-
ous dialects among the american indians the afri-
can and mongolian tribes but i catch no familiar
sound of course my knowledge covers only a
minute fraction of the known dialects

  you can prove nothing by me i declared
english french and spanish sum me up

  james the muscular contributed nothing but
stolid silence the drugged coffee was still troub-
ling him a little anyhow acts and not words were
his specialty

  as for trying to locate this thing by any known
electrical test fleckner went on im completely
stumped i dont want to take the machine to pieces
for fear of losing the connection for good and i
want to locate that language as a matter of curiosity
my range and distance indicators register nothing
at all i cant understand it im simply going to
watch developments for a while perhaps something
will appear on the screen that will give us a clue
and late that evening just as we were about to
give up and retire for the night his patience was
rewarded priestley and i had already gone to our
rooms when fleckner who had taken one last look
at the screen before settling back in his chair for a
nap suddenly shouted out excitedly

  somethings happening come out here

  we ran out and looked at the screen which a
moment before had been showing only a faint green-
ish yellow it now glowed with a clear white light


amazing stories

excepting for faint shadings here and there which
presently began to take definite form in a few
moments more the slowly developing screen showed
the interior of a big open room

  we seemed to be looking down the broad aisle of
a warehouse on the right of the aisle was a row
of bins full of something that looked like coarse
gravel on the left was piled high a long tier of
slabs apparently some sort of building material
shaped something like old-fashioned bricks only
larger we saw it all dimly as through a thin haze

  we studied this picture curiously trying in vain
to determine in what obscure corner of the world it
might be suddenly the misty obscuration of our
vision cleared and we saw it all plainly the con-
tents of the nearest bin and the end of the long tiers
of bricks stood out in bold relief a moment we
gazed at it wonderingly then fleckner jumped to
his feet and shouted

  the treasure of tantalus at last

  the supposed gravel pebbles were precious stones
millions on millions of them glittering and shimmer-
ing with fairy light the bricks were of solid gold

chapter xxi

the singer revealed

there could be no doubt of it by this
strange fortuitous accident we had been per-
mitted to peer in to a treasure-house stored
with fabulous wealth fleckner verified our first
judgment of the material in the bins and bricks by
applying the new reflective spegtrum test which he
had invented not only were the supplies of these
most precious materials in the big storehouse but we
discovered that the building itself was made of
bricks and slabs and girders of gold the floor was
a priceless concrete of jewels bedded in golden ce-
ment

  here indeed it seemed was moral defectiveness
developed into madness chandler or the alleged man
above him who received the crime trusts treasure
had apparently converted the vast stores of the or-
ganizations stolen wealth into this fantastic mate-
rialized dream of grandeur rivaling the ancient con-
ception of a golden hereafter

  but where was this trove  of its location we were
as ignorant as ever it was more than before our
treasure of tantalus lying in plain sight but as
much as ever out of our reach

  it had ceased to be an academic problem with
professor fleckner gone was the calm concentra-
tion of the scientist and man of pure intellect in
his place was again the feverish avaricious searcher
for hidden riches

  back and forth across the laboratory he paced
never taking his eyes from the maddening picture of
the gleaming treasure and cudgeling his brain in vain
for some method he had not yet tried for determin-
ing where the end of our magic ray rested so the
night wore away priestley and i dozed at intervals
in our chairs morning came and we ate breakfast in
moody silence the mystery was beginning to bore
us

  then suddenly there broke again that eery song

  if we could only determine the language or
dialect shes singing we might locate the general
quarter ol the globe in which your treasure lies

priestley ventured pity we dont dare invite in
some language experts to identify it

   fleckner stopped short and clapped his hands to-
gether in glee

  an idea he exclaimed good for you priest-
ley we cant bring the experts to us but we can
take our mysterious song to them

  priestley and i looked at each other in alarm
during all the reign of terror he had inspired
fleckner had never been so presumptuous as to ap-
pear outside his apartment or to abandon for a
moment the pretense that he was traveling in south
america secure as was his secret hold on the crime
trust and through it upon the machinery of the law
it was still entirely possible that some person or per-
sons unknown to us might connect him with priest-
ley and the general public was still clamoring for
the capture of priestley and the twenty-million-
dollar fortune he was believed to have fraudulently
diverted from the public treasury fleckner once
caught and held as a witness in the priestley case
would have a hard job concealing any longer the
secret of his telephonoscope and the universal havoc
he had wrought with it

  now he was mad enough to propose calmly going
forth and exposing to various outsiders one of the
results of the use of that instrument

but the old man was not mad enough to fail to
notice our alarm i think in his preoccupation
with the pranks of his invention he had not realized
until now that his prisoner-guests were no longer
in the drugged stupor in which he had been keeping
them

  he looked sharply from one to the other of us
but naturally made no comment on our renewed
mental acuteness i wondered uneasily if he would
suspect die tampering with the coffee and shift the
drug to some other article of our diet perhaps in
larger and more effective doses i resolved at the
first opportunity to warn priestley that we must eat
sparingly of every tiling set before us

   at any rate he set our minds at rest as to his next
move

  tm not going to expose us to any danger he
explained remember im still supposed to be
traveling in the andes and it will be perfectly
plausible that i should use a long-distance telephone
from there just watch me work and see how simple
and safe it is

  while he was talking he must have pressed the
secret switch connecting up the apartment telephone
for he now punched up a number on the call-board
of his desk phone

   may i speak with dr bonstelle he asked after
a moment

  i recognized the name of the head of the lan-
guage department of columbia university a world-
famous philologist

   dr bonstelle fleckner continued in a moment
this is professor rufus fleckner you may have
 noticed by the papers up north that im taking a
vacation tour in the andes mountains im calling
now from the city of santa brazos in northern
chile ive struck a curious phenomenon in your line
and wanted to get your opinion on it i would like
to follow it up before i leave the region so i am ven-
turing to consult you by long-distance phone a
treasures of tantalus



group of wandering minstrels apparently a gipsy
tribe came down from the mountains yesterday and
gave a musical in the plaza here they sang for
the most part in the zingaro or spanish gipsy
dialect but one young woman sang a little thing
in an utterly different tongue neither i nor any
of the natives i interviewed-including indians
of several different tribes-who were about the
plaza could find any resemblance in it to any fam-
iliar tongue i tried interviewing the gipsies but
got only suspicious shrugs they wouldnt let me get
to the girl herself i made a phonographic record
of the song and would like to transmit it to you if
youll put a phonograph in front of your receiver
you can let the different men in your department
have a try at it in case it isnt at once familiar to
you

   apparently dr bonstelle swallowed the story and
readily consented to the request for fleckner
brought out the song record put it in a machine and
placed it in front of his phone transmitter again
i was forced to admire the consummate skill of the
old liar

   just a moment professor fleckner i said plac-
ing a cautious hand over our transmitter why not
try him with the spoken dialogue too that might
be easier to read than the words of the song

   he looked at me pityingly

  bright idea he sneered it would be quite a
help in case they recognize this language and the
conversation of our mysterious pair happened to give
away the story of the treasure

  he pushed me away from the phone and i sub-
sided abashed

   but dr bonstelle after listening to the song and
taking a record of it declared himself as much in
the dark as we he recognized not a trace of re-
semblance to any of the general families of lan-
guages he agreed however to have the men of his
department try it out professor fleckner arranged
to call him up in twenty-four hours and get his re-
port

   soon after fleckner had completed these arrange-
ments there were further developments on the
screen the picture began to sway back and forth
revealing different sections of the golden ware-
house to grow dim and bright by spells

   the professor became nervous at this

  i hope we arent going to lose it now just as
theres a chance of solving the riddle thats the
exasperating part of being unable to control the in-
strument ive proved this much though a ter-
restrial current of electricity of tremendous power
has been set up by some seismic disturbance our
rays have been caught and held by it they arent
powerful enough to break away or be directed in-
dependently well just have to let thiscurrent play
with them until i can increase the power of the
generators enough to offset the big current

  he spent the greater part of the day equipping
some additional generator units out of odds and ends
of spare parts in his storeroom he was nearly ready
io connect in these new units when something else
happened on the screen

  the swaying of the picture had been growing
more violent at intervals as the day passed sud-
denly it shifted abruptly to the right the interior
of the big building slid off the screen and left us

gasping in unbelieving amazement at what took its
place

  we seemed to be gazing down the length of a
broad deep canon down its center flowed a wind-
ing stream along the margin of which rested curious
one-story houses flat-roofed and rambling tower-
ing rugged walls arose on either side of the canon
deep-cut irregular ravines branched off in various
directions there was a little curious stunted veg-
etation here and there of unfamiliar varieties but the
swaying of the picture prevented our examining it
closely

  the overwhelming wonder of the place however
was this not merely all the houses in sight were
built of the same precious materials as the big ware-
house we first saw the ground of the great valley
also was of glittering soil strewn with boulders of
gold and emerald and diamonds and other precious
minerals in sizes such as no man had ever before
dreamed outside the pages of fable or the vision of
the apocalypse the great precipices were of solid
gold streaked with veins of silver and studded with
gems the river flowed over golden sands and
sparkling pebble gems

  the treasure of tantalus indeed

  but now the ray shifted again and on the screens
foreground lay a little dell at the mouth of a ravine
that opened on the shining sands of the river-shore
there a little pocket of ordinary soil had washed
down and the dell was screened with dwarf trees and
carpeted with moss and curious grasses all the
foliage was of pale greenish-yellow as though its
golden habitat had permeated its veins

  this scene became steady for a moment and as we
drank in its details the now familiar song burst again
on our ears

  an instant later the shrubbery parted and the
singer herself stepped forth

chapter xxii

the lady of tantalus

i think even our case-hardened old jailer-
scientist fleckner forgot his sordid aims for
a moment as we saw before us for the first
time the materialization of the golden voice whose
haunting melody had so enchanted us i knew from
the gasping sigh that escaped priestley that he was
at least as hard hit as i even the ultra-phlegmatic
john fleckners second man whose turn at watch it
was let go a deep-chested bit of blasphemy so in-
flected however that it expressed the greatest meas-
ure of awed admiration of which his nature was
capable

  my fear that the singer once faced would fall
below the promise of her voice had been utterly
groundless it was as though one of raphaels angels
had suddenly stepped forth from the canvas pal-
pitant with life-a figure of slenderest grace draped
in a robe of shimmering cloth of gold a cataract of
golden hair flowed well below her golden gem-
studded girdle unbound except for a finely engraved
circlet of gold about her exquisitely modeled head
the perfect oval of her face was as if carved from
old ivory excepting for the thin ruby line of her
descate mouth and eyes blue as the sapphires in her
girdle


amazing stories

  but why should a fatuous old man bore his
readers with a feeble attempt to paint a word-picture
of a face that enthralled him for a moment a half-
century ago enough that my enthralment complete
as it was lasted only a moment for i suddenly
found myself contrasting this idealization of wom-
ankind with the intensely human face of little miss
stimson into whose eyes of violet i had been per-
mitted to gaze so briefly once my enthralment with
the vision passed leaving behind it only a feeling of
satisfaction over my sense of feminine beauty tom
priestley would have been saved some bitter hours
if he had experienced the same change

  but professor fleckner was wasting no time over
mere admiration of a glorious face he was busily
adjusting his cinema machine and phonograph at-
tachment to catch every move and word of the girl

  meanwhile she stood by the river-brink gazing
abstractedly into the gleaming water and softly
humming over again the familiar song

  suddenly she stopped singing and with a little
exclamation of delight knelt swiftly and darted a
slender hand into the waters edge she drew out a
small irregular pebble rusty black in color and
still kneeling gazed at it raptly with frequent repeti-
tions of her little cry of delight

  what this precious find could be we were unable
to guess from the fleeting glimpse we got she was
now holding it close in her cupped hand out of out-
range of vision

  she was so preoccupied that she failed to hear
steps on the jewel-pebbled beach around a clump
of shrubbery a man appeared he was a tall well-
shaped figure clad in a simple tunic skin-tight
trousers and sandals all of the same golden fabric
as the girls garments his hair was a shade darker
than hers and fell uncut to his shoulders he wore
likewise a long untrimmed yellow beard

  the cut of his features suggested a relationship
to the girl which his age and subsequent attitude to-
ward her clearly indicated to be that of father but
the blue eyes of the father were cold steel the
girls glowed with the warmth of a summer sky
avarice was the keynote of his expression there
was the same calculating gleam in his eyes that i
had noted so often in the pale orbs of professor
fleckner

  he stood for a moment regarding the kneeling
figure curiously then he crept stealthily forward
and peered over her shoulder at sight of what she
held in her hand he uttered a harsh cry and seized
her by the arm

  she leaped to her feet and faced him with wide
startled eyes shrinking back and clutching her
bauble to her bosom

  the father held out his right hand commandingly
and held her arm roughly with his left speaking a
volley of harsh syllables

  a moment the girl hesitated and then reluctantly
handed over what she held the man held it up to
his face and with a grunt of satisfaction thrust it
in his tunic and strode away the girl as soon as he
was out of sight threw herself on the ground and
shook with sobs

  all this time we had caught only a fleeting glimpse
of the object that had caused two people so much
agitation

  the girl was gradually getting her grief under

control when again a step sounded on the bank above
her the bushes parted and a young man about her
own age stepped out he was as perfect a speci-
men of masculine beauty as she was of the feminine
he was dressed in the same general style as her
father his complexion also was fair and his face
shone with the idealism of healthy young man-
hood

  he caught sight of the girl and ran toward her
with a cry of solicitude arms outstretched she
scrambled to her feet in confusion and shrank back
blushing but evidently not displeased at seeing him

  he seemed to ask her numerous questions to
which she replied in monosyllables at length she
led him to the edge of the stream and pointing to
the spot where she had picked up the bauble broke
into voluble speech she was evidently telling the
story of her find and of her fathers action

  the young man knelt down eagerly and began
digging furiously in the shimmering sand suddenly
there was a call from the bank above in the harsh
voice of the girls father

  the girl started guiltily spoke a low word to the
youth and with an answering call to her father ran
swiftly up the bank the young man arose and
looked after the girl for a moment with an expression
of mixed affection and anger then he walked down
the rivershore and disappeared

  though the little dell remained fixed on the screen
for some time after that there were no more signs
of life manifested and it finally faded to a barely
perceptible outline

  fleckner took advantage of this interlude to turn
back to the building up of a higher power ray and
as he worked we debated the meaning of the scene
we had witnessed

  for my part i had become convinced that pro-
fessor fleckner was wide of the mark in believing
his errant rays had hit by accident on the crime
trusts treasure trove which we had hunted so long
in vain

  if we had found nothing more than the ware-
house full of treasure that we first sighted i would
believe you might be right i admitted but when
i saw an entire grand canon made of solid gold and
jewels i knew at once the crime trust could never
have stolen enough wealth for that even if their chief
were fantastically crazy enough to convert the bulk
of it into such unusable forms as mountains more-
over there is no section of this part of the world
where such a huge freak could be hidden it must
be in some remote and comparatively unexplored
region of the south polar continent made habitable
by escaping volcanic vapors there is apparently
concentrated a great natural deposit of gold and rare
minerals

  i think you are partly right and partly wrong
fleckner countered i agree with you on the prob-
able remoteness of this region i also agree with you
in saying that the mountains and soil we saw are a
natural phenomenon but remoteness is no bar to a
man in an airplane i think now chandler told the
truth when he said he turned the treasure over to a
man still higher up and that the older man we saw
on the screen father pf the singing girl is that man
i believe he discovered a remote tribe of attractive
barbarians in this golden valley while searching for
a place to keep his treasure there he lives part of
his time surrounded by wealth beyond his dreams
treasures of tantalus



and adds to it the stolen millions of the trust hes
not normal of course but you note that a great mass
of gold was in bar form and the diamonds and other
jewels were stored in bins either that is some of
the wealth he has brought in or it is some ready to be
taken out and tised in the outer world think of the
power such wealth gives we must find and control
it

  yes priestley agreed to my surprise we
must find it as soon as possible its time professor
fleckner to call up dr bonstelle again and see if
they have locate- that language yet there must be
no delay in tracing out this region

  he seemed suddenly to be as greedily obsessed
with the idea of the treasure as was fleckner him-
self

  fleckner agreed to this suggestion and got bon-
stelle on the telephone the had a long conference
mostly monosyllabic on fleckners side from which
i gathered that the head of columbias language de-
partment could give us no aid

  neither he nor any one in his department can
make anything out of it the professor reported
after he had hung up he gave me a long discourse
on the history and philosophy of language the only
significance in what he said was that certain funda-
mental sounds in the song could not possibly be re-
produced by any normal human-speaking apparatus
the mystery seems deeper than ever

  fleckner turned back to his generators and priest-
ley after standing for a moment in unseeing ab-
straction went to his room

  i sat for a few moments moodily ruminating on
the strangeness of priestleys attitude then obey-
ing a sudden impulse i stepped over to his door it
stood slightly ajar i had no intention to eavesdrop
i started to knock but at that moment i heard his
voice within he was pacing the floor and talking
to himself

 my little treasure of tantalus he murmured
poor little girl i must find her i must find her
and save her from that golden hell

chapter xxiii

a scrap of strange history

it was not until the middle of the next forenoon
that fleckner completed the assembling of his
additional generator units and was ready to try
them in the hope that he would be able now to over-
come in a measure the influence of the master cur-
rent and have a little better control of the screen
picture of this mysterious valley of tantalus

  meantime we had continued to catch vague
glimpses of it at intervals but no more that were as
steady and clear as that scene by the river shore
nor did we hear the strange song again though we
caught occasional scraps of conversation 

  priestley roamed about in impatient restlessness
every few minutes urging fleckner to hurry his
work for my part the novelty of the thing had
worn off and i found my thoughts straying else-
where i was wondering about the comfort of little
miss stimson hidden awav in solitary confinement
somewherein the big building i resolved to speak
a word for her when at length fleckner had com-
pleted his reconstruction job and sat down for a
minute to rest before trying it out

  dont you think professor i ventured that
you re being a little unfair to miss stimson  shes
missing a most interesting spectacle she was in on
all the forepart of our experiments and naturally has
great curiosity as to what is going on now what
harm could she do in here as long as she has no
communication with the outside

  theres something in what you say the old man
agreed besides she has a keen mind as weve
discovered and might be able to help us with sug-
gestions but it wont be necessary to have her in
here there is a small portable telephonoscope equip-
ment in the storeroom one of my early experiments
ill have john set it up in her room shell be able
then to watch in on our screen ill give her the
cinema films of what shes missed too so she can
bring the story up to date

  he called john and gave the order and assured
me presently that the young lady was now enjoying
the same privileges of outlook as we were

  the test of the additional ray units met with con-
siderable success when fleckner switched them
on the picture on the screen which a moment before
had been an indistinguishable blur suddenly leaped
into clear relief we were looking once more down
the broad aisle of the big treasure warehouse on
one side as before we saw the bins full of gems
on the other the long piles of golden bricks but
now instead of being silent and lifeless the scene
was one of the busiest human activity

  groups of short thick-set men clad only in
breech-cloths of gold net were hard at work mov-
ing the treasure these men were in sharp contrast
to the handsome specimens of manhood we had al-
ready seen not merely in the shape of their bodies
and the lower intelligence of their countenances
their skins were of a ghastly greenish hue

  there were several gangs of these repulsive crea-
tures at work about the warehouse in charge of
each gang was one of the evidently superior race we
had first seen ivory white of skin alert and intel-
ligent

  professor fleckner found that the increase in the
power of his rays enabled him to manipulate them
with a fair degree of control within certain limits
he was able to move the focus about pretty much
at will now shifting various sections of the golden
valley on his screen but he was still unable to do
any of his former close work to control close-ups
or look beneath surfaces the projector refused ab-
solutely to respond he tried to throw one of our
images into a lonely spot jn the valley to see if it
could be done but got no results

  but with the power we had we were able to learn
much our interest centered on the scene of activity
in and around the big warehouse professor fleck-
ner was positive that some of the treasure was now
about to be transported to the outer world andthat
he would be able to follow it with his reinforced
rays and at last learn the location of the valley

  some of the green-hued men were hitched like
draft animals to low rude trucks made like every-
thing else we had seen so far of solid gold the
workers were piling golden bricks into some of these
and were shoveling precious stones into others

  with all my constitutional indifference to wealth
it gave me a curious sensation to see those trucks
piled high with uncountable riches as though they
were so much gravel or clay bricks the contents


amazing stories

of any one of the trucks would have made me a
rich man for life

  eagerly fleckner followed with his ray the first of
the trucks to leave the warehouse it went out a
winding gold-paved road along the river shore past
many houses of gold to a spot where a square ex-
cavation had been dug here beside piles of similar
material the trucks were dumped masons were
laying the cellar foundations of a house with these
bricks mixing the gems with cement and preparing
a concrete to make the cellar bottom

  again fleckners hopes were dashed it was
gradually dawning on him and the rest of us that
here was a land where gold and jewels took the place
of earth and rock and had no value except as or-
dinary building materials

  so with a snort of disappointment the professor
turned his rays back to the warehouse

  for the present he said i think wed better
study these people and get some clue to the meaning
of their tongue when we can understand their
speech we can learn something of what all this
means i still think blair that ive located the real
master of the crime trust a defective with a fan-
tastic oriental type of mind who has carried out
here on earth his dream of a heaven of golden
splendor

  we were able quite clearly to catch the scraps
of conversation that went on in the foreground of
our warehouse picture so we sat down to a steady
period of linguistic study keeping as usual cinema
and phonographic records of all that occurred and re-
turning to our old system of taking turns at watch

  miss stimson now took an active part in our
study flashing occasional suggestions from her
screen in the other apartment to ours in the labora-
tory

  we learned another curious fact about this golden
valley of tantalus there seemed to be no day or
night there only a steady unbroken glow of soft
light the men in the warehouse worked for a period
roughly corresponding to our day and then rested
for a like period

  that tends to confirm your guess that this valley
might be somewhere within the south polar circle
fleckner said to me it is now daylight for six
months there this seems to be our first real clue
to location

  the weeks that followed were monotonous enough
excepting for the occasional discovery of the mean-
ing of a word each new word caught by associating
it with some object or with an act of the speaker be-
came an event to be looked forward to eagerly it
became a game with us each trying with the rest to
see who could locate the greatest number of new
words

great was our triumph one day when by con-
tribution to the translation we were able to
catch the general drift of a conversation between
two of the foremen who sat on a pile of bricks in
the foreground and talked earnestly for over an
hour after the laborers had stopped work we had
seen these two in conference many times before

  we took advantage of the laborers sleeping period
that day to go back over all our phonographic records
of speech and make translations

  patching all our scraps together we made out a
connected story of absorbing interest it seemed that

                                                                    

one of the two foremen was a new man in the valley
he had recently wandered in by accident through the
great ravine from beyond his companion in
dieir conferences was telling him the history of the
valley and instructing him in its ways

  the story we gleaned hinged abolit a mysterious
treasure which the people of this valley possessed
in thi strange land where gold and precious jewels
were common as the dirt under the feet of us ordi-
nary earthlings there was an article so precious that
men lived for it slaved for it committed crimes and
died for it what such a treasure could be was
beyond our power of imagination

  for many ages the green men lived happily in this
valley in savage simplicity wearing no clothing and
dwelling in caves or rough huts of gold never
having heard of the treasure they were happy and
never fought among themselves for each had all he
desired and sought nothing from his neighbor

  then down through the great ravine from the
beyond came and settled among them the men of
ivory skins straight tall and beautiful to look upon
and they dressed in robes of spun gold and had im-
plements and dishes of gold and tools with which to
fashion them they had also each man some more
and some less a portion of the treasure which being
new and very rare the green men looked upon
eagerly and coveted

  then said the ivory-skinned ones to the green-hued
men of simpler minds if you will work for us and
build us houses of gold fashioned as we shall show
you we will give you bits of our treasure

  and so the green men worked for these new
masters and were paid in bits of treasure but being
stupid men could build these houses only as the
masters watched and directed their labors

  and when the green men saw how comfortable
were the houses of gold they asked the masters to
direct them while they built houses for themselves
this the masters agreed to do if they would pay them
back in the treasure they had given them and so
they did

  then when the green men did more work for the
masters the masters paid them with leaves of worth-
less gold that were promises to give them treasure
later on meantime said the masters we are
keeping the treasure hidden and safe but these leaves
of gold will mean that you hold a share in it now
there is more of the treasure out in the ravines we
will show you how to find and dig it up and let you
keep half of it

  so the green men found a little treasure and kept
half of it until they saw how useful were the masters
tools and dishes and how beautiful was their cloth-
ing then the masters sold them these thirigs for the
treasure the green men still had but they paid the
green men for the work they did only in the gold-
leaf promises to pay treasure

  so the green men continued to work more and
more for the masters in hope of some day getting
back some of the treasure and they fought and stole
among themselves for the little treasure that was left
among them but they never dared fight the masters
because they were too cunning and powerful

  then there had come down from the great ravine
madga the great with his beautiful daughter
olanda who was then only a baby

  and madga was more cunning yet than the other
masters and he had with him more treasure than
treasures of tantalus



any of them the other masters all sought his favor
and he traded among them till he had most of their
treasure also and so he came to rule over them
and also over the green men

  and now that olanda the beautiful daughter of
madga had grown up many of the young masters
desired her for a mate but her cruel and covetous
father had decreed that he should have her who first
brought him one full measure of treasure

  such was the story we gathered from our frag-
mentary records and i tried to setit down as nearly
as possible in the simple speech of the narrator

  looking back to the record of the little scene by
the river between olanda and her father madga
and the young man whosa name we now knew was
grudga we were able to interpret that grudga was
one of olandas suitors and apparently the one she
favored most she had found a bit of the mysterious
treasure and her father had snatched it from her

  here miss stimson broke in from her screen in
the other apartment

  none of you has translated the song yet she
said triumphantly ive just worked it out would
you like to hear it

by all means priestley exclaimed eagerly
these are the words she chanted in a surprisingly
close rendering of the original melody and a voice
which for me i confess held more charm than that
of the singer of tantalus

         i am the treasure of the valley
         where my proud sire rules in glory

        many there are who seek me

         one there is who shall find me

         he who is worthy to hold me
         must bring of his lesser treasure
         and pay it fully and freely
         in proof that his heart is single

         for i -am the treasure of the valley
         where my proud sire rules in glory

chapter xxiv

beneath our feet

when the girl finished this rendition of her
rivals vainglorious song i glanced at
priestley out of the cornef of my eyes to
see how he had taken it he looked a little crest-
fallen i was conscious of an unreasoning feeling of
jealousy at the thought that the singer of the transla-
tion might have put some of her own feeling toward
my friend priestley into her voice mingled with my
jealousy was a little inconsistent indignation that he
did not reciprocate her feelings but was lavishing
his emotions futilely on this unknown barbaric
beauty

  i am sick of the very sight and sound of treas-
ure was his final petulant comment on the song
it seems quite essential- though even in affairs of
the heart come were wasting time have you
any more inspirations professor fleckner for locat-
ing this mysterious place

  professor fleckner eyed him shrewdly and
chuckled i think that he realized for the first time
that our romantic coworker was madly in love with
the mysterious lady of tantalus

  priestley he laughed for a young man who
scorns treasure so much i must say you show an
amazing impatience to get at it i suppose what
youre after is to find out the nature of the mvs-

terious stuff these fellows in the valley have beej
making so much fuss over and grab off one full
measure of it ahead of the other young bucks in the
list it beats me though what that stuff can be-
that is so much more valuable than gold and jewels
that they use the latter for building materials

  however i havent any more ideas about locat-
ing the thing ill have to keep experimenting with
the adjustments of my instruments ad if neces-
sary add further ray units until i can get the in-
dicators to record direction and distance again per-
haps in the mean time the terrestrial current thats
playing havoc with us will subside

  i see our green and white folk are stirring again
in the valley lets get on with the story

  so we turned back to the screen on which were
shown the images of our strange people beginning
their tasks again professor fleckner succeeded this
time in exploring the valley a little more widely
presently we came upon a house of gold much larger
than the rest half hidden in a big rock cleft sur-
rounded by high golden palings a cohort of green
men armed with heavy gold clubs guarded it

  while we were examining this curious structure
olanda the singer came out of the gate we judged
then and rightly as it proved that this was the
palace of madga her father and chief of the valley

  the girl hurried down the river shore until she
came to the little cove where we had first seen her
she had in her hand a little golden spade and with
this she began hastily digging in the sands along the
waters edge it was here shehad found that bit of
the mysterious treasure which her father had
snatched away at the time when we first saw her
evidently she was looking for more of it it was
evident too from marks along the shore that she
or others had dug there many times since the find-
ing of the first treasure

  after an hour of fruitless search she threw down
the spade petulantly and turned away in despair
for a long time she stood staring off over the water
in deep thought now and then stooping and picking
up a diamond or amethyst or ruby and abstractedly
tossing it into the stream

  suddenly her eyes widened as with the dawning
of an idea she clapped her hands in delight and
sped away down the river road in front of one of
the houses that lined this highway her steps lagged
and she began to hum softly her familiar melody

she had nearly passed the house when a young
man came out of the door and ran toward her he
was not the favored lover we had first seen with her
olanda he called may i walk with you
you may she replied if youll comfort me a
little im in trouble

  trouble he said falling in step with her there
could be no doubt from the expression on his face
that he was one of her suitors you know i would
do anything i can to help you what is it

  you cant help me she answered it takes
treasure to help me

  treasure he exclaimed stiffening a little but
 have it a little of it i have been saving it for a
purpose i must have a full measure of it before long
if t am ever to be hapjy olanda

  she smiled back at him so understanding that his
face flushed with hope

  but i need only one little nugget and i need it
now she said t must have a new robe and my


amazing stories

father wont let me have it unless i find and give him
one nugget of treasure he is growing more of a
miser all the time he thinks i am finding treasure
and hiding it from him but im not oh if you
could only let me have one little nugget to get my
robe i will repay you when i get another

  the infatuated youth hesitated only an instant
then bidding her wait he went into his house
and returned in a few minutes with something tightly
clutched in his hand he gave it to the girl and she
hastily concealed it in her robe the look she gave
him was a rich reward

  now i must go home and get my new robe she
said and left him to his musings

  but she was no sooner out of his sight than she
slowed her pace and went thoughtfully along head
bowed as though considering her next move

  olanda came a joyous hail from the mouth of
a ravine she was passing another youth stepped
into sight and beckoned her

  come in a little way where we wont be seen
he said i have something to show you

  the girl obeyed wonderingly

  first tell me olanda the young man asked
anxiously can i hope that you wish it to be me who
brings the measure of treasure to your father 

  the warm shy look she-gave him was answer
enough

  never was there a surer hope she whispered
then look he said proudly displaying a golden
measure he drew from his robe

  their heads bent over it together we could not
see the contents but they caused the girl to cry out
with delight

  almost half a measure already she exclaimed
where did you come by such wealth 

  i searched and found them during sleep times
when no one could spy on me i dug them from
the rocks up along the big ravine there are no
more there for ive searched every space but i
know ill get the rest

  and if i had only three of them now i would
be happy the girl sighed and then she repeated
the story of the new robe only this time she placed
her fathers demand at three nuggets

  but if i give them to you the youth demurred
it will take me that much the longer to win you
she turned away in disdain

  if you are to turn miser like my father you will
never win my heart shq sneered

  at that he capitulated and in a moment the fair
schemer left him with the three nuggets stored away
in her robe beside the first

  all that day she roamed about the river shore and
contrived to meet altogether twenty love-sick swains
each of whom in his turn listened to some variation
of the story of the new robe and parted with one 
more nuggets of the treasure he was accumulating to
buy her from her father each was made to think he
was the favored suitor and that greatly strengthened
his generosity three times during the day when
the collection of nuggets under her robe threatened
to become conspicuous she went down to the little
cove where she had been fruitlessly digging and
buried them	g

  the last time she visited the cove she stopped first
at her fathers palace and when she reached the
burial place of the treasure she took out from under
her robe a golden measure she scooped out the

buried nuggets and piled them in this measure then
reburied the whole

  again she kept the treasure hidden under the edge
of her robe so cautiously that we got no chance to
analyze it

  by now it was sleep time again in the valley but
the girl instead of going directly home strolled a
little way up the glen and sat down on a golden
boulder as if waiting for some one

  a few minutes later steps were heard above her
and grudga her favored lover swung himself down
the bank

  she sprang to her feet and went to him in excite-
ment

  i must leave at once she whispered drawing
close to him after you are sure all others are
asleep come here again and dig in the sands by the
river where i found the nugget that day you will
find there the measureful you seek

  then she turned and fled her lover his face
shining with elation left the glen in the opposite
direction and in a few moments all was silent in
the valley

  i had been so absorbed by this clever plot that i
had forgotten to watch priestley but now at this
final revelation of the character of his lovely lady
of tantalus and this decided setback to his romance
he arose and went abruptly to his room and closed
the door

  i think ill snatch a little sleep too i said
call me if there are any complications when the
young man digs up his treasure or if you get any
new clues

  i must have slept for some time when i was
awakened by an excited cry from fleckner priestley
was already by the screen when i got there

  nothing new has happened in the valley fleck-
ner explained but ive made a surprising discovery
it isnt a valley at all but a great cave

  i put in another generator unit after you two
left me and tried the machine out again i had a good
deal better control of it i began exploring up and
down the cliffs with the rays and suddenly found that
where there should be blue sky overhead was a solid
roof of gold about a thousand feet above the river
level this roof is white-hot probably from a molten
lava deposit above it and that furnishes light and
heat to the inhabitants of the cave there must be
openings to the air somewhere but i havent dis-
covered them yet

  but thats not the best of my discoveries after
that i tried my ray direction indicator again and
found it working the ray is pointing straight down

  our treasure of tantalus is directly beneath our
very feet

chapter xxv

olandas plot overreaches

rofessor fleckners delight at his
discovery was unbounded

treasure of tantalus he raved here
weve been hunting for months to find the puny
stealings of the crime trust and right beneath us
right under little old new york is treasure greater
than the present combined wealth of the world
and its ours ours for the taking wait till i get
my instrument to working perfectly again and well
treasures of tantalus	

make old madga our slave hell bring cartloads of
gold and jewels to our door whenever we send for
him i believe chandler told the truth he
wouldnt be wasting time trying to be president if
he had known where this treasure lay

  but i broke in do you really think this madga
is the real head of the crime trust  why should he
need to direct a big organization for plundering
society when nature gave him such wealth

  ah my boy fleckner countered it was pow-
er he wanted what is treasure without the power
it brings he created his organization to give him
that power he had to use wealth as a bait to make
them work for him why should he reveal his great
natural treasure-house or pay them out of it when
he could make them steal their own pay and then
hand it over to him to keep as well the stealing
was just to jolly them along you see he employed
the same methods that he is using below ground
with this mysterious other treasure by which he
rules his barbarous followers

  and those other people in the cave who are
they i persisted

  oh doubtless the green men are prehistoric sav-
ages who got lost underground ages ago the white
men are probably descended from early white set-
tlers who wandered into the cave and also got lost
but i must get busy and tinker up this old machine
so i can find the entrance to our cave of tantalus
while fleckner worked over the telephonoscope
controls priestley more restless than ever was un-
able to sit still two minutes in succession i could
read his thoughts in his transparent countenance as
easily as though he had spoken them the duplicity
of the beautiful olanda had not destroyed his infatu-
ation he was consumed with a fever to get to her
before the lover she so far favored could reap the
fruits of her trickery and claim her from her father
if the professor was right in his conclusions priest-
ley might be able within a few hours to present him-
self before her in person 

  i confess that i myself was more than half con-
vinced and not a little anxious to bring on the
denouement to mitigate my impatience i whiled
away the time by reading the newspapers which in
our excitement over the affairs of tantalus we had
neglected for some days

  professor fleckners preoccupation with other
matters and his inability any longer to use his tele-
phonoscope at will had of course removed his guid-
ing hand from the malicious activities of the crime
trust for many days

  but a glance at the papers showed that the reign
of terror he had started had gone on under its own
mmentum increasing like a snowball rolling down
a hill it was to be assumed that organized trust
activities had ceased as the gang would not dare to
act without its leaders orders but the publicity
given to the series of inspired robberies and black-
mailing plots had evidently stirred to life the morally
defective traits of many individuals all over the globe
who had not been enrolled in the organization for
the papers teemed each day with reports of a world-
wide crime wave

  the distrust in banks and business corporations that
he had started had grown until the nations were in the
throes of a financial panic countless business and
bank failures were noted unemployment for the first
time in half a century had again become epidemic

  in the political world the results were even more
serious the two or three instances of apparent
bad faith on the part of statesmen manufactured by
the professor had set the imagination of the poli-
ticians to work no one any longer trusted any one
else dissensions were breaking out everywhere be-
tween the component nations of the league the
league council wa rent with strife it looked as
though the permanence of the league itself were
threatened and as if another world war were im-
minent

  a minor phase of the activities of fleckners
frankenstein was an epidemic of reports of dis-
appearing persons started by the kidnaping of the
twelve men who knew the telephonoscope secret 

  every man woman or child who was lost sight
of by family or business associates for a few hours
was reported kidnaped miss stimsons disappear-
ance had been noted in lurid headlines among others

  i had nearly finished my reading when on the
front page of the paper of the day before there
leaped before my eyes a story that at first amused
me greatly in spite of my heartsickness over the tales
of havoc i had been digesting then as i read it
through i was filled with consternation this was
the headline

world famous scientist reported
among missing

professor rufus fleckner celebrated inventor

believed kidnaped by south american bandits
-last seen in northern chile

  the fiction of a trip through the andes which
fleckner had arranged as an alibi by projecting his
image into various south american cities and giving
out interviews there had proved a boomerang

  there was a sensational interview with dr bon-
stelle of columbia university in which he told of
the telephone call from professor fleckner and the
strange language he had consulted him about hear-
ing nothing from fleckner after his second phone
call bonstelle eager to learn more had tried to get
in touch with the professor through brother scholars
in chile but when they attempted to trace him
from town to town it had become apparent that he
had disappeared in the mountains after he had
been missing for some time the chileans became
alarmed reported it to the government and searching
parties of soldiers were now beating the mountain
passes for news of him

  meanwhile his friends in new york had become
greatly exercised and now proposed asking the police
to break into his apartment to seek possible clues as
tothe itinerary he had planned

  it was this last proposal that filled me with alarm
i tried to show the article to fleckner but he waved
me away so impatiently that i decided to wait a little
till i could get him to give his attention to the seri-
ousness of this new development

  in case of a legalized attempt to enter his home
fleckner had counted on getting any such order
revoked by his hold on the legal machinery through
his power over crime trust agents with the tele-
phonoscope out of control this of course was im-
possible

i therefore became as interested as fleckner and
priestley in seeing the repairing of the instrument


amazing stories

hastened he was now putting the finishing touches
on a new set of generators i watched with breath-
less eagerness while he was connecting them up if
he found this time that he could now break the rays
away from the terrestrial current and use them at
will as before i meant to show him the last news-
paper article i had read and warn him to take steps
at once to head off the proposed police raid on the
laboratory

  but jut as he tightened the last screw of the new
battery something happened on the screen that
diverted my attention from affairs on the surface of
the earth i was destined to forget for some time
to come all newspapers and their sinister warnings

  grudga the favored suitor of olanda was stealth-
ily entering the little dell by the river to dig up as
the girl had told him to do the measure of treasure
that she had so craftily gathered and buried there
he reached the point she had indicated and with
trembling eagerness dug in the sand with a golden
spade until he uncovered the measure the girl had
buried

  he clutched it to his breast and drew a fold of his
tunic over it then as stealthily as he had come he
started to leave the ravine

  now olanda dear heart you are mine  he mur-
mured joyously

  but at that the shrubbery parted and a sinister
figure stepped forth grudga stopped in alarm

  hendriga the half-breed he gasped

  he turned to flee but the other leaped forward
and bore him to the ground

  the newcomer was a powerful figure with the
heavy muscular development of the green men and
the tall straight frame of the white men combined
his hue was light but a slight greenish cast showed
the strain of inferior blood his youthful features
were regular but their expression was one of cruel
cunning

  so olanda is yours  he sneered not while
hendriga has power in his arms

  he clutched his mighty fingers into the throat of
his prostrate rival until the latters gasping breath
ceased then he transferred the measure of treasure
to his own tunic and contemptuously tossed the life-
less body into the stream

  now hendriga will claim the fair olanda he
muttered as he walked swiftly away

chapter xxvi

time slips its cogs

  t was the voice of priestley that first broke the
     spell of horror that held us

    we must stop him  we must stop him try
the projector now he cried leaping for the con-
trol-board

  but fleckner was ahead of him and already work-
ing frantically at the lever that might project our
images down and confront the fleeing murderer

  it was of no use the projector failed fleckner
had to content kioiself by following with his ray the
form of hendriga who was now well on the way to
the house of madga his prospective father-in-law

  the rest period was just ended beyond the
golden stockades could be heard the bustle of the
awakening household the green men who had
stood guard during the rest period were about to
change watches with the work period guards there

was a voluble chatter of greetings and scraps of
gossip

  hendriga made known to the guard at the gate that
he wished to see madga the chief while the guard
took the message within the half-breed stood eagerly
eyeing the shining gold wicket as if he could ill re-
strain his impatience to state his triumphant errand
we heard the shuffling steps of the guard returning
and heard him fumbling at the chain within

  at that instant there was the snap of a broken
circuit in the network of the telephonoscope wires
under the control-board and the screen went blank

  a curse on that fuse  fleckner muttered throw-
ing open the fuse-box ripping out the melted metal
and slipping in a new one with the swift precision
of his practised fingers that added battery of
generators overloads the thing a little

  he made some rapid adjustments among the be-
wildering mass of coils and switches

  there thats better he announced ill get a
little more power in the ray now

  i had anxiously watchcd the clock while this was
going on a shade less than three minutes passed
between the cutting off of the picture on the screen
and the instant when it flashed back as fleckner
switched on the power of his repaired instrument

  we stared in bewilderment at first it seemed
that the ray must have shifted and given us an
entirely different outlook

  but closer inspection showed the same outline of
overhanging precipice and the house in its deep cleft
the dwelling was of the same form and size the
river passed it at the same sweeping curve there was
the same vista of the valley visible from the gate

  yet the gate which three minutes before had been
in perfect repair now hung half open from a single
hinge a broken bit of chain dangled from its
latch the golden palings when we last saw them
had gleamed with the brilliancy of frequent polishing
by green-hued slaves now they were dull and bat-
tered as from long neglect and lack of repair

  the roadway in front of the house that had been
kept in perfect condition showed great cracks and
worn gaps what had been neat grass-plots be-
tween the road and the paling three minutes before
were patches of weeds between the palings and
the house where before had been close-clipped
shrubbery were big trees

  and the sturdy laughing voting guards who had
stood alertly in front of the palings a moment be-
fore some dozen strong were all gone in their
place there perched on a boulder by the gate a dirty
dejected old man looking more like a beggar than
a guard

  what could it mean  this could not be the same
place our rays must have been diverted by the
blowing out of the fuse this must be another
near-by cavern i conjectured in which a prosperous
race had formerly dwelt perhaps madga himself
had once lived there and built this house and later for
some reason moved to the other and strikingly simi-
lar valley and duplicated the structures in it it
would not  be out of keeping with the other per-
formances of this strange master-defective i voiced
these theories to fleckner

  that may be he agreed i was thinking some-
thing of the sort myself well soon find out

  he started to swing the rays about and search for
another cave when we heard voices within the great
treasures of tantalus

house high-pitched angry voices speaking in the
now familiar tongue of the cavern

  fleckner sent our rays through the open gate past
the neglected garden into the house his last addi-
tion to his generator power had enabled them once
more to penetrate surfaces

  in the main hall were three people engaged in a
heated wrangle there was something about each
of them strangely familiar yet weirdly different
there was a middle-aged woman tall and still slen-
der and fair of skin her features were strikingly
like those of olanda daughter of the chief indeed
she might well be the girls mother but the ex-
pression of the face was hard cold and petulant

  the old well-preserved man beside her was even
more like madga father of olanda than was the
woman like his daughter his was the same erect
figure arrogant bearing and crafty avaricious ex-
pression the features seemed an almost exact
duplicate of madgas save for more pronounced
lines of age the only difference between them was
in their flowing hair and beard madgas was rusty
gold this mans snowy white

  and the third member was startlingly like hen-
driga the half-breed excepting that he was older and
his hair streaked with gray

the first words of the woman startled and be-
wildered us even more than what we had already
seen

  you treat us like children my father she com-
plained facing the older man with blazing eyes
they call me olanda daughter of madga chief of
the valley i am more like madgas slave not for
twenty years now have i so much as seen a bit of
treasure not since this creature bought me from
you

  we looked at each curiously each wondering if
the others saw and heard the same thing

  yes he bought you dearly worthless girl and i
made well in the selling you ask me for treasure
now have i not kept and clothed you both these
many years and when did you pay me any treasure
for it

  we have worked and slaved for you when your
old slaves fled from you because you abused them
and never gave them pay except useless promises of
treasure  the man broke in if i had not had
some of the blood of the green men in my veins and
been able to control them therefore they would have
murdered you long ago

  the woman looked at the speaker in loathing

  dont talk of murder hendriga she shuddered
i have not forgotten how you won me and dont
boast of your blood before me t-

  she broke off suddenly

  enough of this she added in a whisper here
come the children it is not necessary that my beys
hear how their father won their mother by killing the
man she really loved

  nor how their mother furnished her purchase
treasure by robbing a score of other suitors he
retorted

  at that three half-grown boys rushed into the
room

  mother mother dont let them get me cried
the smallest of the three rushing up to the woman

  hes found treasure mother one of the others



cried were just playing you know were rob-
bers trying to steal it from him

  what has the boy got demanded the old man
excitedly snatching the chubby fist of the youngest
boy and prying out of it a small nugget

  the old man gave one look at it and threw it
away in disgust

  nothing but gold he muttered will no one
ever give me any more treasure 

  at that there was another loud report under the
telephonoscope control-board and again the screen
went blank

  we sat and stared at each other for a full minute
without speaking priestley was trembling like a
man wth the ague he was the first to break silence

  did you two see and hear what i saw and
heard  he demanded

  fleckner who was himself visibly agitated looked
at me as if to read my face i could only nod
dumbly

  we think we did fleckner said at length
what it means i cant imagine

  he began mechanically to repair the blown-out
fuse while priestley and i communed with our be-
wildered thoughts

  this time he took some fifteen minutes at the
work and seemed in no hurry to turn back to that
sordid maddening mystery of the underground

  at length he threw on the current

  i put in a larger main cable he said itll
carry the current better and give the ray more
power

  the golden palace again flashed on the screen
at the first glance we saw that still another change
had taken place now the road in front of the
building was almost obliterated the palings were
torn away the yard was a tangle of underbrush and
big trees that almost hid the house from sight

  fleckner handled the control levers in a half
daze he sent the ray once more into the big room
where we had just witnessed such a strange scene

  here we got another shock for which it is true
the appearance of things on the outside had in a
measure prepared us on a couch by the far wall
lay an emaciated old man gasping for breath twice
we looked before we recognized madga the chief

  he looked as though twenty years had passed
since we had last seen him erect and virile scarcely
twenty minutes before

  beside him sat a gray-haired woman a little bent
a little wrinkled but still strong and alert her
face was as cold and cruel as that of the aged wreck
on the couch but it was nevertheless the face of
olanda the singer-olanda suddenly grown old and
terrible by some malignant alchemy that left us
doubting whether after all these years of scientific
skepticism the arabian tales of black niagic were not
the literal truth

  food  food  olanda give me food  will you
starve your old father to death quavered the sick
man

  i will answered the harsh cold voice of the
metamorphosed olanda you get no food till you
tell me where you have hidden the treasure this is
the last time tll ask you tell me now or ill leave
you to die

  i give up he gasped lean close or your
sons may hear

  she bent over him while he whispered something


amazing stories

we could not catch then she arose and sped from
the room not seeming to hear the feeble cry from
the couch of food food

  in the next room four people awaited her eagerly
one hendriga now an old man still erect and
sturdy ugly malignant avaricious as ever the
others were men in early middle life fine of form
and regular of features but in the complexion of
each a faint touch of green hue and in their coun-
tenances a predominant expression of cruel avarice

  they were young dandies in dress tunics trousers
and sandals new and bedecked with glittering gems
about the head of each was a circlet of gold each
bearing over the forehead a single great gem one a
diamond one a ruby and one an emerald so closely
did they resemble each other that they could be dis-
tinguished only by these gems

  olanda looked at her husband then at the younger
men

  my sons she said haughtily leave us i wish
to speak to your father alone

  the three young men glanced at each other ques-
tioningly and nodded with secret understanding he
of the diamond circlet acted as spokesman

  no he said firmly addressing his father we
can no longer be ordered about like children the
old man our grandfather has told you where he has
stored the treasure that is not a secret for your
keeping the old mans life is done let him die
you too are old and could not rule for many years
you have already shown yourselves unfit to rule as
we believe this valley should be ruled the green
slaves have fled our white race too has nearly
deserted us

  we have decided to take the rule into our own
hands and bring back the old days of prosperity
you will tell us the secret of the treasure we will
take it and use it rightly dont deny us you are
but two and old and one a womali we are three
young strong men

  we have already barred the windows tell us
where the treasure is or we will go out and bar the
door and leave you here to starve as you have
starved our grandfather we will leave you now for
a little time to think it over and will return for our
answer-

  as the three unnatural sons strode out of the room
the fuse of the telephonoscope again blew out and
left the screen in darkness

chapter xxvii

after a thousand years

to me it was an intense relief when the break-
ing down of the instrument gave us another
respite from watching this tragic sordid
miracle unfold i was limp with horror and amaze-
ment yet shaken as i was myself my pity went
out to priestley he had seen his high ideal dashed
down

  it simply cant be its absurd utterly impos-
sible and yet- tell me blair what did you

see i wonder if ive been dreaming

i shook myself together and considered my answer

  i saw or seemed to see i replied finally a
generation pass in less than an hour fifty years of
time roll away in a flash characters changed in a
twinkling from fresh youthful innocence to sordid

age through the evil influence of a perverted lust
for material wealth

  did you see that too professor fleckner
priestley asked

  fleckner looked at me searchingly i think my
reference to the degeneration of character stung him
a little

   i seemed to he admitted or else i was look-
ing upon some equally mysterious picture prophecy
of events to be or perhaps what some hidden prophet
believes they will be

   then we have all been hypnotized  priestley ex-
claimed i wonder if olanda ever existed or if she
was merely a dream picture of some ones imagin-
ing

  the answer to that is our complete cinema and
phonograph records the professor reminded him
you cant hypnotize a wax disk or a celluloid film

   as if to verify his own faith he tried several of
the familiar records one or two of them reproducing
the scenes in which time had apparently slipped a cog

  there is no doubt that the pictures we thought
we saw on the screen and the sounds we thought we
heard we really did see and hear im beginning to
wonder however if we have not been the victims of
some colossal hoax though what it may be i cant
imagine depend upon it nevertheless miracles
dont happen this thing has a natural explanation
and im going to find it

  why not consult miss stimson i asked sud-
denly remembering the clever young woman who was
supposedly listening in and watching over her auxil-
iary telephonoscope feminine intuition coupled
with a brain as clever as hers might have some good
suggestions to offer

  thank you mr blair i heard that came her
voice from the screen i have seen and heard the
same things as you gentlemen apparently perhaps
im silly but heres what i thought might be the
explanation perhaps weve been simply looking at
a motion-picture show no im not joking some
one in the crime trust may have learned of the tele-
phonoscope and with the aid of a clever scientist
invented a counter-instrument that has caught and
held your telephonoscope ray

   then they may have conceived the idea of getting
up this fantastic film picture with the idea of baffling
and bewildering you they could put it on a screen
in front of your ray and get the effect couldnt
they

  they could my dear young lady fleckner
agreed but they didnt pictures of dummy gold
and diamonds would not respond to the spectrum
test that cave of gold is real as i proved when we
first saw it

   that might be she persisted and at the same
time they could stage a picture play there couldnt

they 

   well fleckner agreed improbable as your sug-
gestion seems at least it has a scientific basis and
isnt as absurd as the jumping ahead fifty years in
time that we seemed to see ill get my instrument
going again and try to test that theory out a little
im hoping ill be able to get a second ray in opera-
tion and work it independently of the first then i
can locate our picture again and by placing the
second ray around it discover if there are any stage-
trappings or other trickery
treasures of tantalus



it was nearly an hour this time before the instru-
ment was again ready for use fleckner made
several readjustments finally he turned on the ray
and disclosed once more the dilapidated golden palace
as we had seen it last there had been no great slip
in the passage of time since our last view for in the
big sealed-up room where their unnatural sons had
imprisoned them we still found old olanda and her
half-breed husband

  nevertheless more time seemed to have elapsed
in the picture story than the clock on our laboratory
wall showed for the old couple had the appearance
of having starved for several days they were weak
and emaciated the arrogance had gone from their
countenances

  i can stand it no longer olanda whispered
when our sons return again we must tell them the
hiding-place of the treasure and beg for food

  yes i suppose we must-curse them hendriga
muttered feebly	

  fleckner had been adjusting his reflection-spec-
trum analyzer and testing the materials reflected in
the picture

  see he exclaimed those materials are real
gold and precious stones and actual human flesh
if we were looking at photographs reflected on a
screen at the other end the analyzer would show
nothing but the material in the canvas of their screen

  well check it another way now if i can work
the rotater of the ray end after that last readjust-
ment well be able to look in turn at all sides of
the bodies in the picture and determine if they are
solid or merely flat reflections

  he tried the rotation control and this time the
ray responded perfectly the room and the two
wretched occupants slowly revolved on the screen
showing the scene from every angle

no doubt of it fleckner concluded were
looking at a real spectacle containing real people
but protested the voice of miss stimson from
the other apartment it may be play-acting for our
benefit nevertheless

  well said fleckner lets try a second ray on
the outside of the house

  he turned on a second ray and as he had hoped
it worked independently of the first keeping the
interior on one end of the screen we showed the
outside of the house on another section

  but now another amazing change had taken place
inside of the house seen by the first ray was still the
period of madgas death and olandas and hen-
drigas old age and their sons middle age outside
the house was the state in which we had seen it that
day when we had found olanda and her husband
then in early middle life and their sons small boys
there was even the single old green-hued slave
guarding the half-broken gate

  while we were wondering at this we were struck
with new amazement around the corner of the
house came the middle-aged olanda her three little
boys playing around her

  by now our capacity for experiencing the emotion
of amazement had been overstrained we gazed
dully at the parallel pictures of the sturdy matronly
olanda without and the aged emaciated olanda
within

  even as we looked there entered into the picture
of the interior of the room by way of our first ray
the three grown-up sons to make final demand for

revelation of the secret from their aged parents and
at the same time outside of the house seen over the
second ray were those same sons innocent children
playing around their mothers robe

  in this strange underground world it would seem
that time did not merely leap forward with lightning
speed but in some places leaped back again but
professor fleckner had suddenly lost his late bewil-
derment he was manipulating his levers with an
intent eagerness i knew the old scientist was on
the trail of a clue to this puzzle

  im going to swing in a third ray he muttered
half to himself	

  at once another section of the great cave valley
appeared seen through the third ray on the other
end of the screen and here time had slipped back
still another notch the valley once more spruce
trim and prosperous was teeming with the life we
had first seen there

  fleckner shifted this first ray about till he located
the little ravine where we had first seen olanda
again our ears were enchanted by that marvelous
song and again we saw her in the beauty of her
fresh maidenhood and beside her her murdered
lover returned to life

  at this priestley leaped to his feet his face aglow
with incredulous joy i think for the moment he
was half mad he seemed to have forgotten our
presence

  olanda olanda he cried i knew id see
you again the rest has been a bad dream he
recovered himself immediately let me handle that
third ray he pleaded i-i want to watch her a
little

  	go as far as you like my boy fleckner con-
ceded i think by increasing the strength of that
ray you can follow the lady right back to her infancy
if you wish for im sure ive solved the riddle

  but this was lost to priestley who was raptly
watching the picture of his lady of tantalus living
her life over again

  i watched the professor with intense curiosity
while he set down elaborate calculations on his desk-
pad stopping now and then to make readings of ray
directions and strength on his instrument dials

  at length he looked up and regarded priestley
curiously a touch of pity in his hard old face

  ive got it he said quietly our cave of tan-
talus and its treasure and its people are not on our
earth at all but on a distant planet so far away that
it takes its light a thousand years to reach us priest-
ley my boy im sorry your olanda was very real
once but she lived her life and died a thousand
years ago

chapter xxviii

fleckner dethroned

wike everything else its very simple when
 you understand it the professor went on

  -- while we stared at him stupidly unable to
grasp his astounding statement i wouldnt have
been deceived so long if i had kept track of the di-
rection our rays were turned after i got the control
apparatus restored

  you see the first time i got the direction of our
ray and found it pointing straight down i jumped
to the conclusion that our tantalus land was in the


treasures of tantalus

bowels of the earth directly underneath us that
idea seemed to be confirmed by our finding that land
to be located in a great cave i was so absorbed in
our treasure hunt that it didnt occur to me to test
the ray direction again until a few minutes ago
then i found it pointing straight up

  i knew at once that our cave of tantalus was on
mother heavenly body than ours our earth had of
course swung around in its orbit and revolved on its
axis and the direction naturally was changing con-
stantly

  in a flash the whole explanation of the apparently
miaculous shifting back and forth of time came to
me i was right in believing that a general electrical
current had caught and held our feebler ether ray
out of control but instead of a mere earth current
it was a great interstellar torrent of electrical energy

  now the ether wave motion that carries light
electricity and other radio manifestations as every
student of physics knows travels at the rate of one
hundred and eighty-six thousand miles a second
that is practically instantaneous for all ordinary dis-
tances but distances between stars are another mat-
ter some stars are so far away that it takes cen-
turies for light to reach us from them

  such a star is this one on which our cave is
located by certain computations based on the known
power of my various rays and the lapses in time be-
tween the visions they showed i have found that
sights and sounds that started over the ether waves
from this star-tantalus well call it-a thousand
years ago would j-ust be reaching us now a thousand
years after they happened

  well our rays from the telephonoscope which is
variable in speed according to its intensity shot out
into space against this current only a comparatively
short distance at first perhaps twenty light years
in other words it picked up the scenes and sounds
from tantalus only a little before the ether waves
bearing them would naturally reach the earth our
ray with its vastly greater speed transferred those
scenes to our screen practically instantly they hap-
pened to be the scenes of olandas youth

  then i doubled the power of our ray and it shot
out twenty light years farther and gathered scenes
coming over the ether waves twenty years later all
in an instant again i increased its speed another
twenty light years and in an instant we saw olanda
as an old woman

  just now we set three rays of three different
lengths and speeds at work as a result we saw the
same general locality in tantalus in three different
periods at once

  but now i must readjust the rays to still higher
speed and watch olandas sons claim the grand-
fathers wealth i must find out what is that
mysterious treasure of tantalus that is so much
more precious than gold and jewels it may give us
a hint of something valuable on our earth that we
have overlooked i want to see too what success
those three young men had in rehabilitating their
valley

  thus while priestley and i sat still overwhelmed
by this stupendous revelation of vast spaces and the
solemn moral lesson that had been borne to us over
the bridge of a thousand dead years the old scientist
dismissed the marvel with a contemptuous wave of
the hand and set out again on the trail of his sordid
curiosity he fell to work at the adjusting of his in-

strument at first with methodical precision but i
noticed presently that his hands trembled and that he
was laboring under suppressed excitement

  the work didnt proceed smoothly he made
little mechanical slips more and more frequently and
had to undo and repeat parts of his work he would
fly into a rage each time this happened i fell to
studying his face i noted for the first time how
haggard and deathly pale he had become from weeks
of neglect of sleep and proper food during which his
brain had been continually afire with his mad obses-
sion

  at length he threw on the power of the ray section
he had been working on and it failed to work at all
he had forgotten to replace a perfectly simple con-
nection of one of the main cables

  at that he flew into a still more violent rage he
thrashed about the laboratory waving his arms in
the air and snarling inarticulately like a maddened
animal priestley john and i leaped to our feet
and stood hack in alarm the man was evidently
mad

  suddenly he stopped short in the middle of the
floor and clasped his head tensely between his hands

  my mind has failed me he shrieked i cant
find the treasure the sons of olanda will hide it
from me i cant-

  he swayed and before any of us could catch him
he fell forward on his face and lay there deathly
quiet

gently we raised the gaunt figure now so
completely powerless and laid him on the bed
in his own room he was breathing heavily but
was unconscious

  in this emergency priestley became the embodi-
ment of cool masterful efficiency he despatched
john to the drug-closet for a stimulant and admin-
istered it the professor revived partially under its
influence and began muttering incoherently

  go and release miss stimson john priestley
directed next we need an emergency nurse at once
and only a woman will answer you stay in the
room here with her to help in case he gets violent

  now we must get a doctor in immediately weve
got to throw secrecy to the wind and before the
doctor arrives weve got to get up a plausible story
to account for things ill start off by calling a doc-
tor and giving him a yarn

  at this moment miss stimson returned with john
i could not see clearly what effect her long confine-
ment and intense excitement had on that remarkable
young woman for her face was as usual partly ob-
scured by the green eye-shade i felt a wave of
tenderness and embarrassment pass over me when i
saw her once more but tny heart sank again with the
old hopelessness when i perceived that she scarcely
noticed me but was shyly studying priestleys alert
face

  but he was already calling up dr arthur thorn-
dyke who he learned from the girl was fleckners
physician we waited with breathless interest to
hear what explanation he would give the doctor

  dr thorndyke he said when he reached the
physician this is thomas priestley-yes thomas
priestley the very same the man whos wanted by
the district attorney whats that oh doivt let
that worry you im going to give myself up as soon
as i can im the victim of a conspiracy thats all
treasures of tantalus



ill clear myself easily enough its a long story and
ill tell you all about it later this is professional
confidence now

  ive been kept prisoner by the conspirators
whove been using professor rufus fleckners apart-
ment as a rendezvous and prison for me ever since
the professor went to south america on his trip
they waylaid the professor in chile and kidnaped
him too he escaped and got back last night by
airplane the bunch here fled when they found hed
escaped

  now we want you up here at once please pro-
fessor fleckners experience knocked him out he
collapsed a few minutes ago hes unconscious and
in a critical condition youll be right up thank
you

  now he said as soon as hed hung up get
james and john and the cook in here and well
frame up our story well he went on when we
were all present its obvious we cant reveal the true
story of the crime trust that would create worse
world-wide panic even than already exists

  consequently we cant give fleckners perform-
ances away even if we wanted to we dont want
to if he dies theres no use in disgracing the
memory of a great scientist whose mind temporarily
went wrong if he lives well need him to help undo
the harm he has done

  now our story i suggest should be this well
admit the existence of a band of criminals but well
profess to know nothing of their identity well
give no hint that any prominent persons were in-
volved well allege that they learned of professor
fleckners invention the telephonoscope and wanted
to make use of it they had to get everybody out
of the way who knew about it they learned- that
the professor and blair here were starting for
south america so that automatically disposed of
them they hatched up a charge against me to make
my disappearance plausible and then kidnaped miss
stimson and me out from under the nose of the law
and hid us here after fleckner went then they
meantime captured the twelve other gentlemen who
knew the secret

  when the criminals representatives sent to
south america to keep track of the professor
learned he was about to return they kidnaped him
and blair they escaped and returned here last
night by airplane entering by the roof of course
and surprising the gang here who promptly fled

  that makes it possible to give out the secret of
the telephonoscope and explain in a measure the mis-
chief it has wrought but put the blame on an un-
known person we have several tangled situations
to unravel and several mysteries to solve we must
move with extreme caution and im afraid practise
some justifiable deception or we will do more harm
than good

  first the telephonoscope itself what shall we
do with it weve seen the terrible results of this
power to invade privacy shall we force fleckner
to destroy it and let his secret die with him 

  then what shall we do with the crime trust if
we expose it and its entire personnel well smite
every community in the country with tragedy and
disgrace well fill the world with even greater dis-
trust than at present we must find some way to
stop its evil activities without creating a revolution in
the present social organization by exposing it

  we must restore the plunder of the trust we
have three mysteries to solve there was there a man
higher up than chandler where is the secret plun-
der of the old trust where is the plunder that
fleckner gathered

  then there is the problem of retiring the im-
mense amount of counterfeit money in the country
without causing further financial panic

  now in order that i may be free to help solve
these mysteries and the problems involved im going
to give myself up to the district attorney at once get
released on bail and have my trial put off until
fleckner is well enough to testify in case he lives
and his reason is restored

  now the doctor will be here at any moment is
our story all straight are there any other prob-
lems we havent thought of 

  i looked at miss stimson at that moment and
again caught her shy glance toward priestley i
thought then there was a serious heart problem that
promised to be the most difficult of all in the solving

chapter xxix

priesdey heads the crime trust

of all the lurid tales that had filled the papers
since the beginning of professor fleckners
reign of terror none created a greater sen-
sation than those which followed his breakdown i
had returned to my own paper that afternoon and
had the great glory and poor satisfaction of writing
the first story the fact that i was scoring the big-
gest beat in my newspaper career was entirely off-
set in my own mind by the knowledge that for the
first time in thai humble career i had perpetrated a
fake i assure the reader that the writing of this
true history after all these years has been a great
relief to my conscience

  after outlining briefly in my introduction the story
priestley had suggested i told how our party after
being kidnaped in the andes by supposed chilean
bandits had discovered that our captors were new
york gangsters whose names however we had not
learned we had escaped in a running fight during
which we had killed the leaders of the gang

  we had returned the whole distance to new york
by plane and surprised another section of the gang
in fleckners apartments they had been so taken
by surprise that they had fled

  then followed a description of professor fleck-
ners great invention the telephonoscope all the
mysterious invasions of the worlds privacy in recent
months were attributed to the unauthorized use of
that instrument by the gang while occupying his
apartment in his absence

  i told of the capture of priestley ruth stimson
and the twelve men who knew of the telephonoscope
all these prisoners t went on to relate had been
found in the fleckner group of apartments and re-
leased the twelve capitalists had been kept drugged
and could tell nothing of how they got there or what
happened

  dr thorndyke was quoted as having found pro-
fessor fleckner suffering from a complete nervous
collapse and temporary insanity the doctor how-
ever predicted his gradual recovery

  the rest of the story hinged on priestley the
afternoon following dr thomdvkes visit he had


amazing stories

called at the district attorneys office and given him-
self up he had been arraigned pleaded not guilty
and released on heavy bail to be tried when fleckner
was able to testify

  to the district attorney priestley confided that he
and miss stimson had overheard some things which
led him to believe that given time he would be able
to make certain that the criminal band had been
broken up and possibly restore much of the loot of
the recent epidemic of thieving as he believed most
of it had been accomplished by that gang

  priestley promised to bring this about by organiz-
ing a secret detective corps and following up the
clues he had picked up while a prisoner of the gang
he pledged half of his fortune if need be to the
task

  the district attorney at priestleys request as-
signed assistant district attorney winter secret
member of the upper council of three of the crime
trust to assist priestley in this work

  the conversation that took place a little later be-
tween priestley and that crime trust representative in
the latters private office in the criminal courts
building was a memorable one to both of them

  mr winter priestley said when they were
alone for your own good much more than mine
i warn you before i begin that there must be no
record made of this conversation and no eavesdrop-
ping so you will kindly disconnect your dicto-
graph

  they sat looking each other hard in the eyes for
a moment whatwinter saw in the face of his
vis-a-vis taught him discretion he smiled a little
sheepishly opened a drawer in his desk and threw
off a secret switch

  now do you feel better he asked with a forced
attempt at gaiety

  no not exactly priestley replied evenly but in
a minute you will feel not quite so badly as you would
if you realized that other ears or eyes than yours
were going to take in what im about to say per-
haps youll understand what i mean when i say that
i am the head of the crime trust

  what cried winter leaping to his feet

  he was too surprised and alarmed to think of
pretending not to understand

  sit down and dont get excited mr winter
priestley adjured him all you have to do is to
listen and obey ill do the talking

  when i say i am the head of the crime trust i
dont mean that i am the original head i am a
usurper of late date i have overthrown your secret
chief and have him entirely in my power i know
all of his secrets furthermore i have on file a
complete list with records of each of every mem-
ber of the secret organization i have also an inter-
esting collection of photographs and phonographic
records of various crime trust episodes and con-
ferences these might interest you as samples

  he laid on the desk before winter some of the
photographs fleckner had shown chandler that
memorable night when the professor had taken over
the leadership of the crime trust omitting of course
the ones in which chandler himself was portrayed

  with trembling hands winter turned them over
one by one

  well he said at last this is rather convincing
i assure you i will give you the same loval service i
gave the old chief whoever he was i hope you will

overlook the treatment that was given you while you
were prisoner i was not personally responsible for
that

   priestley raised a deprecating hand

  well overlook that he said ive picked you
because for many months now i have been studying
you over professor fleckners telephonoscope which
youve just heard me describe to the district attorney
ive made up my mind you are the best man to act
as my lieutenant

  winter began to regain his poise at this

  im sure im glad i have your confidence he
said

  now let me explain further priestley went on
a complete set of such photographs as this together
with moving pictures of the episodes they are taken
from and phonographic records of conversations
and also a full list of all trust members with their
careers is in the hands of each one of a little group
im working with also several sets are in safe-
deposit under control of trustees with instructions
to open and publish them if anything happens to me
or any one of our group

  so any attempt on the part of the old organiza-
tion to put me or any of my associates out of the way
will be automatically punished by exposure and if
that happens god pity you the public will never
let you get as far as a prison farm youd be torn
to shreds by a mob any refusal to carry out my
orders will lie likewise punished well know be-
cause we  keep you checked up with the telephono-
scope

  i understand winter replied humbly tell me
what you want me to do i have no choice in the
matter

  theres where i have a surprise for you priest-
ley went on from this moment on the crime trust
is going to cease being a criminal organization and
become a secret association for the enforcement of
law and recovery of stolen property organized by
mysel f and my associates as far as the general public
will know and cooperating with the new york
county district attorneys office through you a
single criminal act by any member hereafter will
mean instant exposure of his past record

  winter leaped to his feet his face alight with in-
credulous joy

  do you mean that mr priestley i cant tell
you how glad i am to hear it im sure a lot of the
rest of us will feel the same way we made one little
slip once and attracted the attention of the organiza-
tion we got caught in the net and couldnt escape

  im glad to hear you say that priestley replied
heartily now its up to you to pass the word along
to every last man but youve all got to atone for
your past you have all been receiving a share of
the crime trust profits you must restore it every
man of you set the machinery of the organization
in motion call for a report of money transferred
to every branch and demand it back by instalments
where necessary but get it have each consignment
go by van at night to point no  in putnam
county where that  treasure van was lost
a van manned by men from the district attorneys
office will meet it there and bring it into one of the
trust companies which you will name as repository

  meantime compile a list from all over the coun-
try of every one who has been robbed since the
crime trust began operation announce that our
treasures of tantalus



secret agents are locating the lost plunder through
crooks who have turned states evidence and begin
paying back the money in instalments as fast as it
comes in

  but winter demurred much of our money is
counterfeit

  ive thought of that priestley admitted but it
cant be told from real to announce publicly that
our paper money had been inflated by such an enor-
mous amount of indistinguishable counterfeit stuff
would complete our present panic depreciate our
currency almost to the vanishing point destroy all
confidence in our government issues and create gen-
eral financial ruin no we must simply stop the
counterfeiting plant at fall river utterly destroy it
and then let our present currency run its course
it will rectify itself when i discover the secret
hiding-place of the stolen gold and we get it back
into circulation when the acute danger has passed
a few years from now we can use indirect methods
to get the government to retire all present issues
gradually thats the best policy

  now ill leave you to carry out these orders while
i get after the hiding-place of the crime trusts treas-
ure ill admit that the old head of the trust hasnt
revealed it yet but hes in my power and hell do so
rather than face exposure then ill begin to ship
gold to point no  and let you know when to
meet it

  this interview with winter priestley reported to
me in detail but of course i printed only the version
meant for public consumption a few days later i
had the pleasure of publishing the first results of
the new regime of the former crime trust under the
leadership of priestley when the first vanload of
restored money was met at the trysting-place by
the district attorneys men winter had some trouble
getting his chief the district attorney to agree to
priestleys terms that the criminals who were sup-
posed to have turned states evidence should not
have their identity revealed but he finally conceded
the point

  the radical element of the public however were
loud in criticism of this blind following of an in-
dicted man some radical papers even hinted that
priestley had guilty knowledge of the original thefts
to the day of his death my old friend suffered from
this suspicion but refused to let me write the truth
in his vindication as long as he or the other prin-
cipals in this secret episode were alive

  he was soon cleared of the technical charge
against him however when it became apparent
that fleckner would be a very sick man mentally
and physically for many weeks to come priestleys
counsel consented to go to trial without his testi-
mony the evidence of the rest of us proved suffi-
cient and priestley was acquitted it was ruled that
the long distance method he used for getting his
cousins signature to the release of his fortune was
valid and the telephonoscope was thus given a definite
standing under the law

chapter xxx

treasures revealed

but all this time the mystery that had baffled
us so long the puzzle that had unseated
fleckners reason remained as much a mys-
tery as ever we were no nearer than eyer to locat-

ing the hidden wealth of the crime trust for that
matter the second collection of loot gathered and
hidden by fleckner himself during the months of
his regime proved as elusive

  our earthly treasures of tantalus were still as
much out of our reach as that mysterious treasure of
the star tantalus a thousand light years away

  between us and those great stores of hidden wealth
were the disordered minds of two sick men chandler
and fleckner

  for the ex-president-elect was still pitifully weak
though convalescing and common humanity forbade
our applying threats to him in the hope of getting a
clue to the funds of his old organization

  as for professor fleckner he had occasional lucid
intervals as he gradually grew stronger in body but
all inquiry regarding his secrets at such times threw
him into a fury which resulted in a relapse into irra-
tionality so ruth stimson who continued to care
for him as tenderly as though he were her father
finally forbade our troubling him further

  the old man grew very fond of her and never
wanted her out of his sight one night after he had
been restless and almost violent at times he settled
down at last for a fitful sleep muttering deliriously
now and then

  ruth ruth he whispered suddenly half rous-
ing

  she bent over him solicitously

  yes what is it

  i cant keep it from you any longer youve
been so good to me its under the old mill race near
where the treasure van was lost that time its all
yours

  then he fell into the first natural sleep he had en-
joyed since his attack

  the reader will recall that fleckners two men
john and james had according to his statement
when he first boasted to us of his stealing of the
treasure van assisted in hiding that loot afterwards
he had evidently arranged with another agent by way
of the telephonoscope but john and james had de-
parted for parts unknown the moment the professor
collapsed that day so we got no chance to quiz them

  however they did not seem to have dared touch
any of the treasure for priestleys agents found it
intact where fleckner in his delirium indicated and
it was presently back in its home vaults

  that left the big mystery of the original treasure
to solve there was also the problem of what should
be the future of the telephonoscope which had
proven itself such a dangerous implement professor
fleckner was convalescing now he had never been
irrational again since he unconsciously gave away his
secret he was still confined to his bed and was
gentle and affectionate with ruth stimson but cold
and uncommunicative toward us he was evidently
unrepentant he did not know yet that his treasure
had been restored to its owners and he still discussed
his schemes with miss stimson for finding the crime
trust loot alternating this with speculation as to
what was finally accomplished by the three sons of
olanda on tantalus the star and what their mys-
terious treasure really was

  it was a serious problem then as to what would
happen if the unrepentant fleckner continued to use
his invention against the privacy of the world there
was no law to prevent his so using it if he chose
though now that his invention was known he could


amazing stories

no longer employ it for criminal purposes on the
other hand if he turned it over to general use what
mischief might not be done with it by an irrespon-
sible public

  we were discussing these vexatious problems in
the laboratory one evening priestley ruth stimson
and i it had been a light day on the paper and i
was off early professor fleckner was asleep and
ruth had tiptoed out of his room and joined us

  priestley had turned the telephonoscope on
chandlers home earlier in the evening and found
him much improved in health he was alone in the
house with two nurses and his servants it was gen-
erally known that relations between him and his
family had become strained since his breakdown had
lost him his political honors mrs chandler was a
cold selfish woman and their children shared her
disposition

  priestley was inclined to regard this as just retri-
bution for his sins but ruth was warmly sympathetic
i recalled her strange visit to chandlers home that
time when she had procured priestleys release by
impersonating the president-elect i also remem-
bered the night when she warned chandler away
from the van when we were about to trace him to
his treasure-trove i wondered what had been her
relations to the chandler household and again re-
called my vague suspicion that she might once have
been a member of the crime trust herself

  priestley was arguing that now was the time to
appear before chandler and compel him to give up
the secret of the treasure or if he was telling the
truth about a man still higher up to force from him
some clue by which we might locate that person

  no ruth demurred vehemently it isnt the
best way to force people to do right better to per-
suade them my womans intuition tells me that there
is no man higher up that he really knows where
the treasure is and would like to get it off his soul
im going to try it

  wonderingly we watched her go to the telephono-
scope board and throw on one of the lesser rays
that had not been tuned up for the long distance work
on the star tantalus she found chandlers house
and in a moment she revealed him asleep in his
bedroom

  then she threw on the projector and stood in front
of it it was dark in his room but as you know our
rays were independent of light that the eye can see

  are you awake she asked gently

  the man in the bed miles away opened his eyes
and stared unseeing into the darkness

  whos there he cried out

  it is i dont be alarmed  want to talk to
you she replied

  agnes he exclaimed hoarsely where are you 
am i asleep oh ive wanted you so much lately
since theyve left me alone oh i loved you after
all have you forgiven me at last and come back
tt cant be im dreaming

  no you are not dreaming the giri answered
with a little catch in her voice but im not agnes
agnes has been dead ten long years im agness
daughter and your daughter ruth

  priestley and i started violently and stared at her
in amazement

  you are ruth agnes is dead the sick man
was saying how did you get in  where have you
been all these years turn the light on so i can see

you you were a little thing a year old when i left
your mother turn the light on so i can see you
no she answered you cant have a light now
the nurse has forbidden it you can see me in the
morning if yo tell me what i want to know
what ust i tell you he asked tensely

  that you are sorry for the wrong youve done
n the world and are ready to give back the money
you stole

  you know about that he gasped

  everything she said except where the money
is i want to help you give it back

  he was silent for a long time

  will you tell me she prompted

  i cant give it back he answered at length but
i can tell you where it is it is at the bottom of the
deepest part of the pacific ocean ten miles below the
surface

  again priestley and i gasped

  i never wanted the money the sick man ex-
plained i wanted only the power i didnt dare use
the monev or let any one else use it for fear it would
be traced so i invented a counterfeiting scheme to
pay my followers then i was afraid to hide the
money anywhere for fear it would be found i had
to keep ordering robberies to satisfy my followers
but the money worried me so i took it each time
in a big seaplane flew out over the ocean and
dumped it where it would never betray me thats
all i find im very weak still i cant talk any
more

  ill come to you in the morning she promised
and threw off the ray she was weeping when she
turned on us

  now you know my secret she said without
waiting for our questions he divorced my mother
when i was a baby to marry this other woman his
marriage to mother was a secret one she wasnt in
society and he grew ashamed of her but she con-
tinued to love him when i was a little girl she used
to bring me secretly to his house and leave me with
his housekeeper so i could see my father i came to
love him wicked as i knew he was im going to
him in the morning he needs me im going to my
room now i want to cry alone

  she hurried out tears streaming from under the
green eyeshade

  not till that moment did we see professor fleck-
ner he stood in his bedroom door a gaunt figure
in a flowing bathrobe he was smiling sardonically

  so he said the treasure of tantalus has been
located under ten miles of sea-water

  evidently he had been standing and listening for
some time we made no answer

  well he went on its a pity to lose all that
money chandler was an awful fool but theres
more where that came from

  meanwhile im going to satisfy my curiosity as
to that other mysterious treasure that made so much
trouble on our star tantalus a thousand years ago
im feeling pretty fit to-night ive thought up a way
of giving that no  ray a little more speed im
going to have another look at tantalus t recalled
a little while ago where old olanda told her enter-
prising sons to look for their treasure you two
were so busy at the moment watching the young
olanda that you missed it

  he made a rapid adjustment of the instrument
and flashed on the ray it was still under control of
treasures of tantalus



the interstellar current and instantly the great cave
on tantalus was on our screen once more

  but now it was a scene of absolute desolation not
a sign of human life the houses were broken
empty wrecks

  fleckner was a little taken aback at this

  i expected to see the valley flourishing again
he said

  he drove the ray along the river to the great
ravine and up to a point where he picked out back of
some bushes the low entrance to a cave

  heres where she told me to look he said send-
ing his ray into the opening

  a little way in the passage opened into a cave of
considerable size

  near together in the center of the cave lay three
skeletons their torn robes and the heavy gold clubs
told the story of a death battle long ago a band of
gold jewel-studded around the crown of each grin-
ning skull identified the remains of the three sons
of olanda

  a little apart from the other two lay the skeleton
crowned with the diamond-studded band once the
oldest and strongest of the three sons of olanda
he lay with his arms thrust into a little pile of rusty
nuggets the mysterious treasure-trove at last

  professor fleckner turned on his analyzer did a
little figuring on a pad and without a word showed
us the result it was the climax of absurdity in the
midst of this scene of tragic desolation

  thetreasure of tantalus was ordinary every-
day iron ore

  fleckner left his gruesome picture on the screen
and fell to pacing the floor with slow rather uncer-
tain steps at length he stopped and gazed at us
intently

  so iron was the treasure beyond price in a land
where gold and jewels were common dirt what is
treasure anyhow one says gold one says iron
the indian said glass beads it seems to be anything
that a man has so little of that he doesnt dare make
any real use of it when he has it chandler had a
lot of it and it bothered him so that he threw it in the
ocean it makes trouble any way you look at it
i guess ive been a lot of a fool for the last year or
two-a little crazy i guess im sane again now
boys im going to undo the trouble ive made give
back the money ive stolen and bust up the crime
trust that finished the business im converted

  he pointed a bony finger at the cave of death

  im going to give the telephonoscope to the world
and retire ive just discovered something out there
in tantalus that will make it safe people can defend
their privacy as well as ever see that gray spot on
the opposite wall of the cave about a foot wide
i flashed the ray into that wall while i was adjusting
the ray on the interior of the cave the ray pierced

the wall all around that spot but wouldnt go through
it that spots ray proof i analyzed it at the same
time that i analyzed that fool treasure there its
made up of minerals common here ill work out the
formula in the morning for a ray-proof-paint and
you boys can manufacture it along with the tele-
phonoscope itll be cheap everybody can paint
every part of his house with it except a little section
where he wants to give and receive telephonoscope
messages so well all be happy and private again

  im all in good night

  at that the amazing old inventor staggered off to
bed

   priestley and i sat for a time in thoughtful silence
at length he arose hesitantly and approached the
screen he stood and stared for a time at the grue-
some picture

  so thats the end of the story of the treasure of
tantalus he said at last i wonder if i couldnt
throw the ray power back far enough to see olanda
again and hear her sing once more before we leave
her to rest in her thousand-year-old grave

  he turned to the control-board and swung the ray
out of the cave and down the valley to the little dell
where we had first seen the singer of tantalus but
before he could readjust the ray power to throw time
back again to the days of olandas youth there was
a flash and another girl figure appeared on the screen
apparently in the very spot where we had first seen
olanda

  but it was not olanda it was one to me far more
alluring at that moment than olanda had ever been
she wore a modern american dress her figure was
slender and straight her face was not too perfectly
oval but fine sweet and sincere over it was a mass
of wavy brown hair and above all else was the
glory of her eyes

  and dangling from one capable little hand was a
big green eyeshade

  we both stared at her for a moment before i saw
that priestley still failed to recognize her

  its ruth i exclaimed shes thrown her image
on the screen from the little telephonoscope in her
room

  ruth he exclaimed why ruth i dont be-
lieve i ever really saw your face before

  she was looking into his with a light in her eyes
that shines for only one man in the world and from
where i stood i could catch a little of the expression
of his

  i turned and tiptoed out of the room with an ache
in my heart that wasnt entirely cured until i met the
lady who is sitting placidly beside me at this moment
while i write these lines

  for i knew when i saw the answering light in
priestleys eyes that he had found his treasure of
tantalus at last

bp rtrancts tlctgg

 i was conscious of being scooped up anddrawn forward with inconceivable speed for one breathless moment i hung euspended   


the machine man of ardathia



do not know what to believe some-
times i am positive i dreamed it all but
then there is the matter of the heavy
rocker that undeniably did disappear
perhaps someone played a trick on me
but who would stoop to a deception so bizarre
merely for the purpose of befuddling the wits of an
old man perhaps someone stole the rocker but
why should anyone steal the rocker it was it is
true a sturdy piece of furniture but hardly valuable
enough to excite the cupidity of a thief besides
the rocker was in its place when i sat down in the
easy-chair of course i may be lying

  peters to whom i was misguided enough to tell
everything on the night of its occurrence wrote
the story for his paper and the editor of the chief-
tain says as much in his editorial of the th when
he remarks that mr matthews seems to be the
possessor of an imagination equal that of an h g
wells and considering the nature of my story i
am quite ready to forgive him for doubting my
veracity

  however the jew friends who know me better
think that i had dined a little too wisely or too well
and had been visited with a nightmare

  hodge suggested that the jap who cleans my
rooms had for some reason removed the rocker
from its place and that i merely took its presence
for granted when i sat down the jap strenuously
denies having done so

  i must pause a minute here to explain that i have
two rooms and a bath on the third floor of a modern
apartment house fronting the lake since my wifes
death three years ago i have lived thus taking my
breakfast and lunch at a restaurant generally taking
my dinners at the club i may as well confess that i
have a room rented in a down-town office building
where i spend a few hours every day to work on my
book which is designed to be a critical analysis of
the fallacies inherent in the marxian theory ofecono-
mics embracing at the same time a thorough refuta-
tion of lewis morgans ancient society a
rather ambitious undertaking you will admit and
one not apt to engage the interest of a person given
to inventing wild yarns for the purpose of amazing
his friends no i emphatically deny having invented
the story however the
future will talk for itself i
will merely proceed to put
the details of my strange
experience on paper jus-
tice to myself demands that
i should do so so many
garbled accounts have ap-
peared in the press and
leave the reader to draw
his own conclusions

contrary to my usual custom t had dined
that evening with hodge at the hotel oaks
let me emphatically state that while it is well known
among his intimates that hodge carries a flask on
his hip i had absolutely nothing of an intoxicating
nature to drink hodge will verify this about eight-
thirty i refused an invitation to attend the theatre
with him and went to my rooms there i changed
into smoking-jacket and slippers and lit a mild
havana the rocking-chair was occupying its ac-
customed place near the center of the sitting-room

floor i remember that clearly because as usual i
had either to push it aside or step around it wonder-
ing for the thousandth time as i did so why that
idiotic jap persisted in placing it in such an incon-
venient spot and resolving also for the thousandth
time to speak to him about it with a note-book ancj
pencil placed on the stand beside me also a copy of
frederick engels origin of the family private
property and the state i turned on the light in
my green-shaded reading lamp switched off all
others and sank with a sigh of relief into the easy-
chair it was my intention to make a few notes from
engels work relative to plural marriages showing
that he contradicted certain conclusions of morgans
when he said    but there it is sufficient to state
that after a few minutes work i leaned back in my
chair and closed my eyes i did not doze i am posi-
tive of that my mind was actively engaged in try-
ing to piece together a sentence that would clearly
express my thought

  i can best describe what happened then by saying
there was an explosion it wasnt that exactly but
at the time it seemed to me there must have been an
explosion a blinding flash of light registered with
appalling vividness through the closed lids on the
retina of my eyes my first thought was that some-
one had dynamited the building my second that the
electric fuses had blown out it was some time be-
fore i could see clearly when i could   

  good lord i whispered weakly whats that
occupying the space where the rocking-chair had
stood though i did not notice its absence at the
time was a cylinder of what appeared to be glass
standing i should judge about five feet high en-
cased in this cylinder seemed to be a caricature of a
man-or a child i say caricature because while the
cylinder was all of five feet in height the being in-
side of it was hardly three you can imagine my
amazement while i stared at this apparition after
awhile i got up and switched on all the lights to
better observe it

  you may be wondering why i did not try to call
someone in i can only say that thought never oc-
curred to me in spite of my age i am sixty my
nerves are steady and i am not easily frightened i
walked very carefully around the cylinder and
viewed the creature inside
from all angles it was
sustained in the center of
the cylinder midway be-
tween top and bottom by
what appeared to be an in-
tricate arrangement of
glass and metal tubes
these tubes seemed to run
at places into the body
and i noticed some sort of
dark fluid circulating
through the glass tubes the head was very large and
hairless it had bulging brows and no ears the
eyes were large winkless the nose well defined  but
the lower part of the face and mouth ran into the
small round body with no sign of a chin its legs
hung down skinny flabby and the arms were more
like short tentacles reaching down from where the
head and body came together the thing was of
course naked i drew the easy-chair up to the cyl-
inder and sat down facing it several times i
stretched out my hand in an effort to touch its sur-

amazing stories

fact but some force prevented my fingers from
making the contact which was very curious also
i could detect no movement of the body or limbs of
the weird thing inside the glass

  what id like to know i muttered is what you
are where you came from are you alive and am i
dreaming or am i awake

  for the first time the creature came to life one
of its tentacle-like hands holding a metal tube
darted to its mouth from the tube shot a white
streak which fastened itself to the cylinder

  ah came a clear metallic voice english
primitive i perceive probably of the twentieth cen-
tury

  the words were uttered with an indescribable in-
tonation much as if a foreigner were speaking our
language yet more than that  as if he were
speaking a language long dead i dont know why
that thought should have occurred to me then per-
haps   

  so you can talk i exclaimed

  the creature gave a metallic chuckle

  as you say i can talk

  then tell me what you are

  i am an ardathian a machine man of ar-
dathia and you    tell me is that really hair on
your head

  yes i replied

  and those coverings you wear on your body are
they clothes

  i answered in the affirmative

  how odd then you really are a primitive a
prehistoric man

  the eyes behind the glass shield regarded me in-
tently

  a pre-historic man  i exclaimed what do you
mean 

  i mean that you are one of that race of early
men whose skeletons we have dug up here and there
and reconstructed for our schools of biology mar-
velous how our scientists have copied you from
some fragments of bone the small head covered
with hair the beast-like jaw the abnormally large
body and legs the artificial coverings made of cloth
   even your language

for the first time i began to suspect that i was
the victim of a hoax i got up and walked care-
fully around the cylinder but could detect no out-
side agency controlling the contraption besides it
was absurd to think that anyone would go to all the
trouble of constructing such a complicated apparatus
as this appeared to be merely for the sake of a prac-
tical joke nevertheless i looked out on the landing
i came back and resumed my seat in front of the
cylinder

pardon me i said but you referred to me as
belonging to a period much more remote than yours
that is correct if i am not mistaken in my cal-
culations you are thirty thousand years in the past
what date is this

  june th  i replied feebly

  the creature went through some contortions
sorted a few mental tubes with its hands and then
announced in its metallic voice

  computed in terms of your method of reckon-
ing i have travelled back through time exactly
twenty-eight thousand years nine months three
weeks two days seven hours and a certain number

of minutes and seconds which it is useless for me to
enumerate exactly

  it ws at this point that i endeavored to make
sure i was wide awake and in full possession of my
faculties i got up selected a fresh cigar from the
humidor struck a light and began puffing away
after a few puffs i laid it beside the one i had been
smoking earlier in the evening i found it there later
incontestable proof   

  i said that i am a man of steady nerves i am i
sat down in front of the cylinder again determined
this time to find out what i could about the in-
credible creature within

  you say you have traveled back through time
thousands of years how is that possible

  by verifying time as a fourth dimension and
perfecting devices for traveling in it

  in what manner

  i do not know whetheri can explain it exactly
in your language and you are too primitive and un-
evolved to understand mine however i shall try
know then that space is as much a relative thing as
time in itself aside from its relation to matter it
has no existence you can neither see nor touch it
yet you move freely in space is that clear

   it sounds like einsteins theory

   einstein 

  one of our great scientists and mathematicians
i explained 

  so you have scientists and mathematicians
wonderful  that bears out what hoomi says i
nust remember to tell    however to resume my
explanation time is apprehended in the same man-
ner as is space-that is in its relation to matter
when you measure space you do so by letting your
measuring rod leap from point to point of matter
or in the case of spanning the void let us say from
the earth to venus you start and end with matter
remarking that between lies so many miles of space
but it is clear that you see and touch no space
merely spanning the distance between two points of
matter with the vision or the measuring rod you
do the same when you compute time with the sun
or by means of the clock which i see hanging on the
wall there time then is no more of an abstraction
than is space if it is possible for man to move freely
in space it is possible for him to move freely in
time we ardathians are beginning to do so

  but how

  i am afraid your limited intelligence could not
grasp what i could tell you must realize that com-
pared to us you are hardly as much as human when
i look at you i perceive your body is enormously
larger than your head this means that you are
dominated by animal passions and that your mental
capacity is not very high

  that this weirdly humorous thing inside a glass
cylinder should come to such a conclusion regarding
me made me smile

  if any of my fellow citizens should see you i
replied they would consider you-well absurd
that is because the would judge by the only
standard they know-themselves in ardathia you
would be regarded as bestial in fact that is exactly
how your reconstructed skeletons are regarded tell
me is it true that you nourish your bodies by taking
food through your mouths into vour stomachs
yes

  and are at that stage of bodily evolution when
the machine man of ardathia



you will eliminate the waste products through the
alimentary canal

  i lowered my head

  how disgusting

  the unwinking eyes regarded me intently then
something happened which startled me very much
the creature raised a glass tube to its face from
the end of the tube leaped a purple ray which came
through the glass casing and played over the room

qphere is no need to be alarmed said the

  a metallic voice i was merely viewing your
habitat ancl making some deductions correct me if
i am wrong please you are an english-speaking
man of the twentieth century you and your kind
live in cities and houses you eat digest and re-
produce your young much as do the animals from
which you have sprung you use crude machines
and have an elementary understanding of physics
and chemistry correct me if i am wrong please

   you are right to a certain extent i replied but
i am not interested in having you tell me what i am
i know that i wish to know what you are you
claim to have come from some thirty thousand years
in the future but you advance no evidence to sup-
port the claim how do i know you are not a trick
a fake an hallucination of mine you say you can
move freely in time how is it you have never come
this way before  tell me something about yourself 
i am curious

  your questions are well put replied the voice
and i shall seek to answer them know then that
i am a machine man of ardathia it is true we
are beginning to move in time as well as in space
but note that i say beginning our time machines
are very crude as yet and i am the first ardathian
to penetrate the past beyond a period of six thousand
years you must realize that a time traveler runs
certain hazards at any place on the road he may
materialize inside of a solid of some sort in that
case he is almost certain to be blown up or other-
wise destroyed such was the constant danger until

i perfected my enveloping ray of- cannot name

or describe it in your tongue but if you approach
me too closely you will feel its resistance this ray
has the effect of disintegrating and dispersing any
body of matter inside of which a time traveler may
materialize perhaps you were aware of a great
light when i appeared in your room i probably
took shape within a body of matter and the ray de-
stroyed it

  the rocking-chair i exclaimed it was stand-
ing on the spot you now occupy

  then it has been reduced to its original atoms
this is a wonderful moment for me my ray has
proved an unqualified success for the second time
it not only removes any hindering matter from about
the time-traveler but also creates a void within which
he is perfectly safe from harm but to resume

  it is hard to believe that we ardathians evolved
from such creatures as you our written history
does not go back to a time when men nourished
themselves by taking food into their stomachs
through their mouths digested it or reproduced
their young in the animal-like fashion in which you
do the earliest men of whom we have any written
records were the bi-chanics they lived about
fifteen thousand years before our era and were al-
ready well along the road of mechanical evolution

when their civilization fell the bi-chanics vapor-
ized their food substances and breathed them
through the nostril excreting the waste products of
the body through the pores of the skin their chil-
dren were brought to the point of birth in ecto-
genetic incubators there is enough authentic evi-
dence existing to prove that the bi-chanics had per-
fected the use of mechanical hearts and were crudely
able to make  i cannot find the words to explain
just what they made but it doesnt matter the
point is that while they had only partly subordinated
machinery to their use they are the earliest race of
human beings of whom we possess any real knowl-
edge and it was their period of time that i was seek-
ing when i inadvertently came too far and landed
in yours

  the metallic voice ceased for a moment and i took
advantage of the pause to speak i do not know a
thing about the bi-chanics or whatever it is you call
them i remarked but they were certainly not
the first to make mechanical hearts i remember
reading in the paper only several months ago about
a russian scientist who kept a dog alive four hours
by means of a gasoline motor which pumped the
blood through the dogs body

  you mean the motor was used as a heart
  exactly

  the ardathian for so i will call the creature in
the cylinder henceforth made a quick motion with
one of its hands

  i have made a note of your information it is
very interesting

  furthermore i pursued a year or two ago i
read an article in one of our current magazines tell-
ing how a vienna surgeon was hatching out rabbits
and guinea pigs in ecto-genetic incubators

  the ardathian made another quick gesture with
its hand i could see that my news excited it

  perhaps i said not without a feeling of satis-
faction for the casual allusion to myself as hardly
human had irked my pride perhaps you will find it
as interesting to visit the people of five hundred
years from now let us say as you would to visit
the bi-chanics

  i can assure you replied the metallic voice of
the ardathian that if i succeed in returning suc-
cessfully to ardathia those periods will be thorough-
ly explored i can only express surprise at your
having advanced as far as you have and wonder
why it is you have made no practical use of your
knowledge

  sometimes i wonder myself i returned but
i am very much interested in learning more about
yourself and your times if you would resume your
story  

  with pleasure replied the ardathian in ar-
dathia we do not live in houses or in cities neither
do we nourish ourselves as do you or as did the bi-
chanics the chemical fluid you see circulating
through these tubes which run into and through my
body has taken the place of blood the fluid is
produced by the action of a light ray on certain
life-giving elements in the air it is constantly be-
ing produced in those tubes under my feet and driven
through my body by a mechanism too intricate for
me to describe the same fluid circulates through
my body only once nourishing it and gathering all
impurities as it goes having completed its revolu-
tion it is dissipated and cast forth by means of an-


amazing stories

other ray which carries it back into the surrounding
air have you noticed the transparent substance
enclosing me 

  the cylinder of glass you mean 

  glass what do you mean by glass

  why that there i said pointing at one of the
panes of glass in the window

the ardathian directed a metal tube at the spot
indicated a purple streak flashed out hovered
a moment on the pane and then withdrew

  no came the metallic voice not that the
cylinder as you call it is made of a transparent sub-
stance very strong and practically unbreakable
nothing can penetrate it but the rays which you
see and the two whose action i have described above
which are invisible know then that we ardathians
are not delivered of the flesh nor are we introduced
into incubators as ova taken from female bodies as
were the bi-chanics among the ardathians there
are no males or females the cell from which we
are to develop is created synthetically it is fertilized
by means of a ray and then put into a cylinder such
as you observe surrounding me as the embryo
develops the various tubes and mechanical devices
are introduced into the body by our mechanics and
become an integral part of it when the young
ardathian is born he does not leave the case in
which he has developed that case-or cylinder as
you call it-protects him from the action of a hostile
environment if it were to break and expose him
to the elements he would perish miserably do you
follow me

  not quite i confessed you say that you
have evolved from men like us and then go on to
state that you are synthetically conceived and ma-
chine made i do not see how this evolution was
possible

  and you may never understand nevertheless
i shall try to explain did you not tell me you had
wise ones among you who are experimenting with
mechanical hearts and ecto-genetic incubators tell
me have you notothers engaged in tests tending to
show that it is the action of environment and not the
passing of time which accounts for the aging of
organisms 

  well i said hesitatingly i have heard tell of
chicken hearts being kept alive in special containers
which protect them from their normal environment
ah exclaimed the metallic voice but hoomi
will be astounded when he learns that such experi-
ments were carried on by pre-historic men fifteen
thousand years before the bi-chanics listen
closely for what you have stated about chicken
hearts provides a starling point from which you may
be able to follow my explanation of mans evolution
from your time to mine of the thousands of years
separating your day from that of the bi-chanics i
have no authentic knowledge my exact knowledge
begins with the bi-chanics they were the first
among men to realize that mans bodily advance-
ment lay on and through the machine they per-
ceived that man only became human when he fash-
ioned tools that the tools increased the length of
his arms the grip of his hands the strength of his
muscles they observed that with the aid of the
machine man could circle the earth speak to the
planets gaze intimately at the stars we will in-
crease our span of life on earth said the bi-chanics

by throwing the protection of the machine the things
that the machine produces around and into our
bodies this they did to the best of their ability
and increased their longevity to an average of about
two hundred years then came the tri-namics
more advanced than the bi-chanics they reasoned
that old age was caused not by the passage of time
but by the action of environment on the matter of
which men were composed it is this reasoning
which causes the men of your time to experiment
with chicken hearts the tri-namics sought to per-
fect devices for safe-guarding the flesh against the
wear and tear of its environment they made
envelopes-cylinders-in which they attempted to
bring embryos to birth and to rear children but they
met with only partial success

  you speak of the bi-chanics and of the tri-
namics i said as if they were two distinct races
of people yet you imply that the latter evolved
from the former if the bi-chanics civilization fell
did any period of time elapse between that fall and
the rise of the tri-namics and how did the latter
inherit from their predecessors 

  it is because of your language which i find very
crude and inadequate that i have not already made
that clear answered the ardathian the tri-
namics were really a more progressive part of the
bi-chanics when i said the civilization of the
latter fell i did not mean what that implies in your
language you must realize that fifteen thousand
years in your future the race of man was scien-
tifically speaking making rapi-d strides it was not
always possible for backward or conservative minds
to adjust themselves to new discoveries minority
groups composed mostly of the young forged ahead
made new deductions from old facts proposed radi-
cal changes entertained new ideas and finally
culminated in what i have alluded to as the tri-
namics inevitably in the course of time the bi-
chanics died off and conservative methods with
them that is what i meant when i said their
civilization fell in the same fashion did we follow
the tri-namics when the latter succeeded in rais-
ing children inside the cylinder they destroyed them-
selves soon all children were born in this manner
in time the fate of the tri-namics became that of
the bi-chanics leaving behind them the machine
men of ardathia who differed radically from them
in bodily structure--so many human nucleii inside
of machines-yet none the less their direct descend-
ants

  for the first time i began to get an inkling of
what the ardathian meant when it alluded to itself as
a machine man the appalling story of mans final
evolution into a controlling center that directed-a
mechanical body awoke something akin to fear in
my heart if it were true what of the soul spirit
god 

  the metallic voice went on

  you must not imagine that the early ardathians
possessed a cylinder as invulnerable as the one which
protects me the first envelopes of this nature were
made of a pliable substance which the wear and
tear of environment wore out within three centuries
the substance composing the envelope has gradually
been improved perfected until now it is immune for
fifteen hundred years to anything save a powerful
explosion or some other major catastrophe

   fifteen hundred years  i exclaimed
the machine man of ardathia



  barring accident that is the length of time an
ardathian lives but to us fifteen hundred years is
no longer than a hundred would be to you remem-
ber please that time is relative twelve hours of
your time is a second of ours and a year    but
suffice it to say that very few ardathians live out
their allotted span since we are constantly engaged
in hazardous experiments and dangerous expeditions
accidents are many thousands of our brave ex-
plorers have plunged into the past and never re-
turned they probably materialized inside solids
and were annihilated but i believe i have finally
overcome this danger with my disintegrating ray

  and how old are you 

  as you count time five hundred and seventy
years you must understand that there has been
no change in my body since birth if the cylinder
were everlasting or proof against accident i should
live forever it is the wearing out or breaking up
of the envelope which exposes us to the dangerous
forces of nature and causes death some of our
scientists are engaged in trying to perfect means for
building up the cylinder as fast as the wear and
tear of environment breaks it down others are seek-
ing to rear embryos to birth with nothing but rays
for covering-rays incapable of harming the organ-
ism yet immune to dissipation by environment and
incapable of destruction by explosion so far they
have been unsuccessful but i have every confidence
in their ultimate triumph then we shall be as im-
mortal as the planet on which we live

i stared at the cylinder at the creature inside
the cylinder at the ceiling the four walls of the
room and then back again at the cylinder i pinched
the soft flesh of my thigh with my fingers i was
awake all right there could be no doubt about that

  are there any questions you would like to ask
came the metallic voice

  yes i said at last half fearfully what joy
can there be in existence for you you have no
sex you cannot mate it seems to me i hesitated
it seems to me that no hell could be greater than
centuries of living caged alive inside that thing you
call an envelope now i have full command of my
limbs and can go where i please i can love  

   i came to a breathless stop awed by the lurid light
which suddenly gleamed in the winkless eyes

  poor pre-historic mammal came the answer
how could you groping in the dawn of human
existence comprehend what is beyond your lowly
environment compared to you we are as gods
no longer are our loves and hates the reaction of
viscera our thoughts our thinking our emotions
are conditioned molded to the extent we control the
immediate environment there is no such thing as
mind-of the    but it is impossible to continue
your vocabulary is too limited your mentality-
it is not the word i like to use but as i have re-
peatedly said your language is woefully inadequate
-has a restricted range of but a few thousand
words therefore i cannot explain further only
the same lack-in a different fashion of course and
with objects instead of words-hinders the free
movements of your limbs you have command of
them you say poor primitive do you realize how
shackled you are with nothing but your hands and
feet you augment them of course with a few
machines but they are crude and cumbersome it

is you who are caged alive and not i i have broken
through the walls of your cage have shaken off its
shackles have gone free behold the command i
have of my limbs

  from an extended tube shot a streak of white-
like a funnel-whose radius was great enough to en-
circle my seated body i was conscious of being
scooped up and drawn forward with inconceivable
speed for one breathless moment i hung suspended
against the cylinder itself the winkless eyes not an
inch from my own in that moment i had the sen-
sation of being probed handled several times i
was revolved as a man might twirl a stick then i
was back in the easy-chair again white shaken

   it is true that i never leave the envelope in which
i am encased continued the metallic voice but
i have at my command rays which can bring me any-
thing i desire in ardathia are machines-machines
it would be useless for me to describe to you-with
which i can walk fly move mountains delve in the
earth investigate the stars and loose forces of which
you have no conception those machines are me-
chanical parts of my body extensions of my limbs
i take them off and put them on at will with their
help i can view one continent while busily employed
in another with their help i can make time ma-
chines harness rays and plunge for thirty thousand
years into the past let me again illustrate

  the tentacle-like hand of the ardathian waved a
tube the five foot cylinder glowed with an intense
light spun like a top and so spinning dissolved into
space even as i gaped like one petrified-perhaps
twenty seconds elapsed-the cylinder reappeared
with the same rapidity the metallic voice an-
nounced 

  i have just been five years into your future
my future i exclaimed how can that be
when i have not lived it yet 

  but oi course you have lived it

   i stared bewildered

  could i visit my past if you had not lived your
future

  i do not understand i said feebly it doesnt
seem possible that while i am here actually in this
room you should be able to travel ahead in time and
find out what i shall be doing in a future i havent
reached yet

  that is because you are unable to grasp intelli-
gently what time is think of it as a dimension-
a fourth dimension-which stretches like a road
ahead and behind you

  but even then i protested i could only be at
one place at a given tirm on that road and not where
i am and somewhere else at the same second

  you are never anywhere at any time replied the
metallic voice save always in the past or the future
but i see it is useless to try to acquaint you with a
simple truth thirty thousand years ahead of your
ability to understand it as i said i traveled five
years into your future men were wrecking this
building

  tearing down this place nonsense it was only
erected two years ago

  nevertheless they were tearing it down i sent
forth my visual ray to locate you you were  
yes yes i queried eagerly

  in a great room with numerous other men they
were all doing a variety of odd things there
was  
 

amazing stories

   at that moment a heavy knock was heard on the
 door of my room

 mttthats the matter matthews called a loud
 vv voice what are you talking about all this
 time  are you sick 

   i	uttered an exclamation of annoyance because i
 recognized the voice of john peters a newspaper
 man who occupied the apartment next to mine my
 first intention was to tell him i was busy but the
 next moment i had a better idea here was some-
 one to whom i could show the cylinder and the
 creature inside of it someone to bear witness to
 having seen it besides myself i hurried to the door
 and threw it open

  quick i said grasping himby the arm and haul-
 ing him into the room what do you think of that 
 think of what  he demanded

   why of that there i began pointing with a
 finger and then stopping short with my mouth wide
 open for on the spot where a few seconds before
 the cylinder had stood there was nothing the en-
 velope and the ardathian had disappeared

  authors note the material for this manu-
script came into my hands in an odd fashion
about a year after the press had ceased printing
garbled versions of matthews experience i made
the acquaintance of hodge i asked him about
matthews he said

  did you know theyve put him in an asylum
you didnt well they have hes batty enough
now poor devil he was always a little queer i
thought  i went to see him the other day and it
gave me quite a shock you know to see him in a
ward with a lot of other men all doing something
queer by the way peters told me the other day
that the apartment house was to be torn down the
city is going to remove several houses along the
lake shore to widen the boulevard he says they
wont wreck them for three or four years yet funny
eh would you like to see what matthews wrote
about the affair himself 

  i	would and did and like matthews i submit
the story to the reading public herewith and leave it
to them to draw their own conclusions

 ugh-lomi stood before the women and mocked them

   the next day they sat again nearer-without
 stones or sticks and with the same offerings and
 cats-skin had a trout it was rare men caught fish

in those days but cats-skin would stand silently in
the water for hours and catch them with his hand
and the fourth day ugh-lomi suffered these three to
come to the squatting-place in peace with the food
they had with them ugh-lomi ate the trout

editor amazing stories

  let me express my appreciation of the june
number of amazing stories i have too much to
say to enclose it in the voting coupon in regard
to the prize stories i wish to say that i befieve
the judges choice to be perfectly in line with
my own preference all three were very ood
stories i myself was a candidate for the prizes
and i can well appreciate the fine work which
was done

  i have one criticism for mr wates story
frankly i cousider such a thing as a substance
opaque to gravity impossible when one considers
the matter closely it becomes utterly preposterous
obviously a material substance could not be opaque
to gravity the very fact that it is a material sub-
stance makes it susceptible and not impervious to
gravity that is the very essence of gravity all
matter is attracted to all other matter and where
there is anything there is gravity i can conceive
of a screen of some sort of ray or ethereal wave
through which the action of gravitation cannot
function but a material substance never and
furthermore above a screen opaque to gravity no
matter of what it was constituted a man could

the june issue of amazing stories

never assume an attitude of suspension once
gravitation is removed he would go flying off into
space never to return thrust there by centrifugal
force however this does not detract from the-
interest of the story

  and there is another matter of gravity in the
electronic wall i hardly believe that a ship
even the size of the woodrow wilson would
have sufficient gravitational attraction to enable a
man to walk comfortably about it on the other
band assuming paulo to be a solid body the at-
traction of this body would far overcome the grav-
ity of the ship unless the electronic wall is opaque
to gravitation in this case however the passen-
gers would find themselves in the unpleasant situa-
tion of being unable to stay on the ship comfort-
ably weighing naturally only a few grains or less

  i was unable to find any scientific error in the
third story perhaps because it contains less science
than the others

  the lost comet was very good  solanders
radio tomb however has only a very faint hint
of scientific taint and i believe that it has no
place in your magazine to cap the climax t do
not believe that the author intended to put the

slightest bit of science into it other than that
necessary to make it comprehensive ellis parker
butler is a fine humorist and writer but he has
no connection with amazing stories

  the four-dimensional roller-press was a
very interesting manuscript although i fail to sec
what the age of the inventor had to do with the
story and although i understand practically
nothing of the fourth-dimension i have always
considered it to be time and even if it were not
it is clearly a non-material dimension this being
the case will you kindly explain to me how this
fourth-dimensional substance which sidelburg pro-
duced inside his quaint arrangement of spheres
could possibly have a material existence if the
creation of such a substance were possible by a
mere mechanical arrangement of spheres how could
a material substance come instantaneously into
existence where nothing before existed and if
it were not a material substance obviously it
would not be perceptible to the touch as it was
set forth to be in the story

the moon pool is without question the best
story you have yet published it is written in the

 the tarzan stories however all of which i have
 read with intense interest would be fine lessons for

   the moon pool contains a staggering amount
 of imagination in fact there is so much that 
 had to reread the first installment before i could
 begin the second-it seemed so like a new story
 always referring to points  did not remember
 ever having seen before one thing which it brings
 out is the true significance of things that we sec
 every day in regard to the weapons-mr merritt
 brings out the fact that the revolver is really more
 effectual than the keth yet hearing of the

annual or semi-annual

 editor amazing stories

    i just received my copy of the amazing stories
  annual and in looking it through noticed the
  coupon in the back i would like to say that i
  for one approve of the amazing stories annual
  and would like to sec it published every six
  months as a semi-annual and i am sure many
  others feel the same way about it although they
  may not write and say so probably some of them
  think oh well what good will just one more vote
  do but if we all felt that way about it we never
  would get anywhere but ill wager they will
  all buy the annual if it is published every
  six months i would like to say that i think
  the annual would sell better if all the stories in
  it were new ones that had never been published
  in amazing stories before several of my
  friends never bought the annual because you
  stated that it was to be a group of the best stories

 already published in amazing stories magazine
 i am a new reader but i have read the people
 of the pit and under the knife in amazing
 stories before i was glad to see the small illus-
 trations scattered through the master mind of
 mars and would like to see them every month
 in amazing stories in the august amazing
 stories the stories i liked best were the shadow
 on the spark the ultra elixir of youth
 and the chemical magnet i like many others
 would like to see more interplanetary stories and
 afco more stories by edgar rice burroughs and
 jtiles verne

    we have received a good many letters about
 the number of issues of amazing stories which
 should come out per annum a great many desire
 a semi-monthly publication while others prefer it
 as it now is recently we published the amazing
 stories annual giving tnc best stories of the
 year already published and some new ones now
 the question comes up of whether there should he
 two issues of this publication in other words
 whether we should publish a semi-annual rather
 than an annual we should like to hear from
 all of our readers about this question as our
 desire is naturally to please them and to keep
 them for our friends and this with us is a true
 sentiment-editor

the age limit for the interna-
tional science club

 editor amazing stories

   i have been a reader of amazing stories since
 the first edition and i have enjoyed them very
 much but there has always seemed to be something
 lacking that something was a science club in
 co-operation with amazing stories mr lindgren
 has hit the idea all right but why have the age
 limit at eighteen you speak of youth being in-
 terested in the study of science so why not give
 them a chance at this club i should have said
 us because i am one of them as you have prob-
 ably guessed i am fifteen myself and in reading
 discussions you will see there are several more
 about that age who would surely be interested in
 joining so why not put a lower age limit on the
 requirements for membership

   another idea would he to have neighborhood
 chapters where the members could get to-gether
 and discuss various topics and maybe outfit a small
 experimental laboratory and workshop

                          donald l campbell
  chicago iii
  we think you are perfectly right-the age limit
  for membership of the club should be well under
  eighteen in the october issue you will see a
  portrait of a seven year old devotee of amazing
  stories and we firmly believe that he would be
  a valuable accession to the international science
  club-editor

 lot of constructive criticism

editor amazing stories

  after finishing reading this letter the reader
of it may be inclined to ask me why i read
amazing stories my answer would be because
i like it  have read every story in every
issue of amazing stories since the first issue
and have no intention of missing any in the
future and  am not a magazine reader amazing
stories is the only magazine  ever did read
and right now is the only one i have any inten-
tion in reading at all regularly  am telling you
this first because i am going to give you a few
of my ideas in the way of constructive criticism
some of which perhaps will not be very favorable

i wrote you once before and gave you some of
the same ideas and now i am going to do it
again i might remark also that if  did not like
amazing stories l would not bother about writing
you and giving you any of my time i never did
it for any other magazine and never will until
something else as good in general as your maga-
zine comes out

 your motto is extravagant fiction today cold
fact tomorrow an excellent and undoubtedly
true motto but sometimes  find your magazine
does not stay with it every true scientist admits
that anything which is intrinsically possible no
matter how wild and extravagant it may seem may
be cold fact some day but the scientist at the
same time also admits that nothing can ever be
fact which of itself is impossible a square
circle can never be made the definition of a
scientifiction story coujd be thus stated a story
which depicts the intrinsically possible but not
actually existent as actually existent it is obvi-
ous that a story which depicts the intrinsically im-
possible as actually existent is an effrontery to
the intelligence for the reason that the human
intelligence is so constructed that it refuses to
function in the presence of known falsehood some
things are evidently intrinsically impossible as the
square circle but others are not so evident but at
the same time just as impossible for instance the
situation in the story about the lost continmt of
atlantis which i will take up presently you
should carefully guard against allowing such stories
to get into your magazine because they refute
your motto and t have noted quite a number of
rtich instances in various ones

  now for a few of my objections as i say
above you sometimes print poor science in that
you allow authors to depict intrinsically impossible
situations in the story about the lost continent
the passengers on the ship view the inhabitants of
the lost continent going far into the past to do
so and the inhabitants look up at the
ship an intrinsic impossibility the
passengers were viewing that which had taken place
much as an audience in a picture show views what
the actors did when the picture was being taken
an action which has been completed can no more
be changed than can a circle be squared when
the inhabitants lived the ship was not there and
so they did not look up at it therefore the
author has made his characters do something which
had already been completed over again and in
another way that story had no business in your
magazine it was entertaining it is true but that
makes no difference it has no place in a scien-
tiiiction magazine as it is merely fiction not
science

  my really most serious objection to your stories
in general is the lack of imaginative nerve of
so many of the authors there is entirely too
much ruthless slaughtering of innocent heroes and
heroines and entirely too much blowing up and
losing of valuable new inventions the authors
get to the end of their imaginations and take the
easiest way out they do not seem to reaize that
most readers of this class of story are imagina-
tively inclined themselves or they would read
something else and being so the reader can get
just as much if not more enjoyment out of con-
tinuing the story in his own imagination as he
did out of the story itself and this useless
slaughter and unnecessary explosions eliminate this
pleasure to the reader a rare instance of where
the author has allowed this privilege to his readers
is in the master mind of mars in your annual
neither valla dia nor paxton were unceremoni-
ously removed at the end of the story as so many
great heroes and heroines are but are allowed
to remain happily wedded on mars the reader
is permitted by the author to change his own name
to paxton and have a grand time carrying on
in his own imagination his own elevation through
deeds of prowess to the lordship of mars and the
beautiful results of valla dias rise with him
to be the queen of mars or any other flight of
the imagination to which the turn of mind of the
particular reader may direct him the master
mind of mars is well on in its sequel in my
imagination and t am having as much pleasure
out of my own sequel as t did out of the story
itself a columbus of space offered the same
if not even better possibilities for the readers
imagination but the author would have none of
it finding it necessary in the temerity of his own
imagination to dispose of his wonderful hero and
heroine by letting them get caught in nothing but
a common fire when they had already escaped
many more dangerous situations thereby denying
the reader the enjoyment of imagining his ow
sequel that author simply lost his nerve the
same way why always blow up wonderful new
inventions after barely allowing the inventor to
show what he has whv not let the reader con-
tinue with it if the author does not want to go
on with it lots of readers could have a wonderful

    a very breezy criticism

  editor amazing stories

    no doubt we could tbink of a great many ex-
  tremely flattering and complimentary remarks to
  make about your magazine but inasmuch as every-
  one else has made them repeatedly we shall in-
  stead devote our letter to a few criticisms and
  suggestions

   to begin with why in -hades- do you
 insist on printing those detestable boring out-
 of-place and otherwise obnoxious detective stories
 railed amazing merely because they include a short
 paragraph or so explaining the marvelous and com-
 plicated mechanism of the spyrogyroheliospermato-
 graph or something of similar nature stories which
 by no conceivable line of reason can be called
 up to the standard of most of the others

    kick no  and when we say others we em-
  phatically exclude painfully humorous atrocities as
  solanders radio tomb doctor fosdick
  hicks inventions with a kick a big kick and
  others of their ilk

    no  our aesthetic tendencies are extremely
  excited-or rather pained by certain of your illus-
  trations all except those by mr paul whose pic-
  tures are for the most part excellent

    if you have read this far without tearing this
  epistle into myriad shreds we would like to sug-
  gest

    first another cover contest

    second if possible more new stories

    third semi-monthly as-is publication

    fourth less detective stories

    fifth less detective stories

    sixth less detective stories ctc

       but on the whole we appreciate the difficulties
  under which you are laboring and in spite of its
  few and unfavorable defects we will continue our
  yearly and monthly stipends respectively we con-
  sider it rather improbable that you have read this
  far and practically inconceivable that you will print
  a contribution so apparently deprecatory we
  really didnt mean to sound so heartless

                           paul l stanchfield
                           robert d swisher

                              ann arbor mich
  fthis is the kind of letter which we are sure will
  meet with the approval of our flagstaff corre-
  spondent or rather its publication will receive his
  commendation all we can say in answer to the
  criticism is that the detective stories have met
  very wide approval that the stories where science
  is made to contribute to the gaiety of nations de-
  light many and we are sure that mr paul will
  be greatly delighted to read the third kick we
  shall take care that he sees it we find that your
  presumably scolding letter simply radiates good
  humor-editor

  editor amazing stories

    whether he did read your magazine or not
  the gentleman who is the cause of the enclosed
  clipping is surely a find for your side of the
  case to have the same thing occur in everyday
  life that had been foretold by your author in the
  story about jones dollar is a strike for your
  score i am sure the gentleman was inspired
  by your author if not heap on the more olive
  leaves on his noble brow

   who said the amazing things in amazing
 stories cannot become realities

    i am a reader of your magazine since the first
  number and as i have a right to note thumbs up
  or down about my choice all i will say is that
  always you will find two bits in my pocket
  when i see a fresh copy on the newsstand

    and as to praising or knocking your work i
  know all the people cannot be satisfied if each
  man had his way we all would be sultans in a
  world wide harem

    but joking aside-

    i like your magazine and will always purchase it
  as to pictures science proof merit serials and
  other things argued over by people over your ar-
  ticles all i say is that it is your business that
  is what you are being paid for so you know cause

    a fruit dealer made a novel investment in a
    local bank by which his male descendants will
    benefit  years hence

      he deposited  accompanied with in-
    structions that the accumulative compound in-
    terest cannot be distributed until the year 
    then those of his descendants who are living
    in michigan will receive  per cent and 
    per cent will go to those living in other states

  we wish to thank this correspondent for the
  clipping if he will get a table of logarithms and
  calculate the amount that the one dollar bill will
  produce in five hundred years at compound in-
  terest he will be amazed at the result we hope
  that he will always have the two bits in his
  pocket suppose he takes it out of the one dollar

 time using some of the inventions in the world
 of their own imaginations just consider the man
 v ho could vanish  have certainly had a great
 time in the world of my imagination vanishing
 but darn the objector in that story he had no
 sense of humor  have ridden into town many
 a time in my car the car being apparently with-
 out a driver  have paid for my gas with money
 appearing out of thin air i have been a marvelous
 magician i have used it in games such as foot-
 ball throwing au invisible pass into the waiting
 arms of an end down between my own goal posts
 gosh but doc unsin wasa nut to let the thing
 alone and his friend needed a good swift kick
 he was just an old grouch for the lords sake
 let the heroes and heroines live in the end and be
 happy they have a hard enough life so that
 they deserve happiness in the end and let the in-
 ventions go on in the world of the imagination
 it cannot hurt anyone other than the possible
 overworking of the imagination of the author and
 it may give great pleasure to those able to build
 their own sequels

   another of my objections is that so many of
 the stories are strung out apparently with the
 only purpose of making them long the war
 of the worlds is a good one in point the tirst
 installment was good but the second in this
 months issue was awfully dry the exper-
 iences of my brother could just as well have
 been told in one paragraph including the exodus
 of the people the reader of this story did not
 give two whoops about my brother or the exo-
 dus of the people other than just the fact that
 they lit out what the reader wanted to know
 was what were the martians like and what were
 they doing had this story been but the first in-
 stallment plus about three pages it would have
 been fairly good but as it is it got to be an awful
 bore while  am on this story just a few of
 mv impressions while i was reading it mr
 wells certainly commands a punk army his
 cannoneers could not hit the broad side of a barn
 his guns were efficient enough to be effective for
 one did accidentally hit a martian and knock him
 out but at very close range the martians fought
 in  foot towers and mr wells gunners got a
 great number of shots at them mostly from a
 range of about  yards gosh give an ameri-
 can gun crew one good six inch gun and the
 chances that mr wells army had and they could
 clean out the martians in short order men in
 this story are certainly depicted as a lot of ignor-
 amuses and ought to be wiped out what were
 the men doing with the nine spheres after the
 first one lit and men found out what was in them
 why did they not blow them up mr wells does
 not relate that the first ones protected the second
 and later arrivals how greatly would it have
 improved this story if in the end men had figured
 out the martians susceptibility to disease and fed
 them the germs instead of just letting them acquire
 them naturally the men would have won a
 great battle against great odds while as it was
 they just got off lucky without using any inven-
 tiveness or human intelligence i would certainly
 hate to think that the united states army would
 light out and be incapable of fighting no more
 formidable foe than as mr wells depicts the mar-
 tians mr wells certainly drew on his imagina-
 tion when he conscripted his army not construc-
 tively but just the opposite his army was not
 half as good as armies which actually exist right
 now let mr wells martians appear in this
 country today and how long would they last
 gosh lets let men in our imagination at least
 have as much intelligence and ingenuity as they
 have in actuality whats the use of imagining
 if we are going to go the other wav

    a suggestion which i would like to make is this
   hy not publish the name and address of contribu-
  tors to your discussions so that other readers
  could write them damning them or commending
  them as they wish i had a letter published in
  radio news once and got a flood of letters on
  account of it one from as far as finland and i
  may assure you that i consider myself well paid
  ij te jrube f writing that letter as it has
  led to friendships which could not have been
  brought about in any other way

   another suggestion occasionally publish a
 letter which candidly and openly gives your mag-
 azine the royal razz publish the name and address
 of the writer let the editor refrain from com-
 ment to the effect that the writer is wrong and
 let the readers hop on him you may he assured
 that we will do it  and with a vengeance lets
 start a real discussion and let the editor keep out
 of it lots of us readers are somewhat of scien-
 tists ourselves and we do not need the editor to
 put us rieht if there is not space in the maga-
 zine to puoiish it publish names and addresses
 and let us  have our arguments in private we
 will enjoy it and learn a lot through it

    i like your magazine and wish to add my name
 tc hose who want it twice a month it takes me
 about a week to finish it and then there is noth-
 ing to do but go to bed early for the other three
 if you put it out weekly i will read it weekly
 let those who object to its coming twice a month
 on the ground  that too much of a good thing
 spoils it read it only once a month they are
 welcome there are things t do not like about
 it stories which t do not like hut you cannot
 be expected to please everyone in my opinion
 you sometimes allow poor science to creep in you
 print dry uninteresting stories sometimes your
 authors often are not courageous imaginers and
 rob us of the pleasures of our own sequels they
 kill the heroes destroy forever wonderful inven-
 tions with many other faults but the fact remains
 that i read your magazine religiously and intend
 to continue doing so and want it ntener which

  speaks for itself i often feel that i could write
  a really good story for the magazine but then i
  read the discussions and realize that if i were to
  try it it would have the fate of others some
  would like it and some would not  have no
  doubt that many many of your readers think the
  same of themselves they would write the way
  their turn bf mind directs and  mine while it
  is your  task to jdease everyone and this in my
  opinion you are doing admirably

    this we regard as a most interesting letter
 as the writer certainly gives truly constructive
 criticism which we are always delighted to re-
 ceive and puts it into very picturesque language
 the stories must be interesting and even if some-
 thing that seems impossible is described the author
 has at least the excuse and an old time one it
 is now that the impossible has over and over again
 proved to be possible the einstein theory is
 now widely accepted and if by following it out
 the lorenz-fitzgerald contraction is taken as pos-
 sible a lot of the most curious conclusions will
 follow we firmly believe that if before the ein-
 stein theory was promulgated a story had been
 written including all its features bringing them
 down to the concrete making full use of the
 fourth dimension as a reading topic it would have
 been pronounced by most readers quite prepos-
 terous we enjoy writing comments on our cor-
 respondents letters but this one is so good and
 suggestive that it speaks for itself however we
 must refer to one of its suggestions we art-
 asked to publish occasionally a letter which
 candidly and openly gives your magazine the royal
 razz this we have done in the past and shall
 continue to do in the future these unfavorable
 letters or brickbats as they arc sometimes called
 will we are sure reach us in abundance and we
 will publish them in this issue will be seen the
 totally opposite views entertained by our readers
 on identical stories such as the colour out of
 space and strangely enough about the writings
 of h g wells one of the most esteemed authors
 of the present day-editor

h g wells and his stories

 editor amazing stories

    no need to say i suppose that i am an inter-
  ested reader oi your excellent publication amaz-
  ing stories and have been since the first copy
  appeared on the stands

   a number of times ive been on the verge of
 taking advantage of your published invitation to
 make myself heard in regard to my opinions of
 stories youve printed however ive always
 come to the decision to keep still and let others
 do the talking

   ive enjoyed most of the yarns amazing stories
 has given the public so far ill frankly say the
 majority of them have been well told by the dif-
 ferent authors and with the exception of a single
 one the malignant entity theyve all been
 new to me im not of a scientific turn of mind
 or even of mcchanical inclination but i believe
 that like the majority of us  too have my share
 of imagination  appreciate a good story well
 told and thats that i

   i havent so far attached myself to any one
 author who writes for amazing stories-that is
 made a favorite of him most oi them seem to be
 good however i am beginning to tire of one
 of them that particular one is h g wells
 ive seen only one story by this author which
 has been able to hold my interest the time
 machine the rest of the stuff he has given us
 has been i believe but mediocre reading there
 is no snap no life to his stories take for in-
 stance that last story of his youve given us
 the war of the worlds honestly this is the
 rankest poorest would-be yarn ive ever laid eyes
 on whats it all about anyway whats he try-
 ing to tell and why he uses a multi-
 tude of meaningless words and phrases brew-
 ing out of them the sleepiest sort of quatch
 and gets nowhere how does a writer rated as
 high as you rate mr wells get that way anyhow

    i dont mean to do mr wells any sort of injus-
  tice with a criticism like this but i surely do
  agree with mr fred w fisher jr of knoxville
  tenn in saying that this particular story the
  war of the worlds is rotten and 
  agree with him as to the reason why its rotten
  to wit    he is always having one of his
  characters come out of his story to scratch his
  chin or tug his whiskers or expectorate or some-
  thing and   all of his talcs are generally
  disconnected ill say they are mr editor and
  also mr fisher he gives one the impression of
  an amateur trying to raise a tempest in a tea-
  pot in other words much ado about nothing

   i read this story through after seeing mr
 fishers criticism under discussions oi the
 august issue and your defense of mr wells and
 i second mr fishers request not to reprint h
 g wells stories unless lie comes across with
 something worth while in my opinion the war
 of the worlds can easily be boiled down to two
 or three at the most four pages for all the
 science or fiction it contains because the rest of
 it is just plain waste of space and very markedly
 negatives any of that realistic touch which if
 might otherwise contain

   i want to say in conclusion that jules vernes
 off on a comet was very good heres a
 writer who no matter how lie draws out his story
 still is able to hold ones interest and attention
 and im not saying this because im unduly pre-
 judiced against mr wells and favor verne in par-
 ticular station x was good the second

  the work of the distinguished author h g
wells fails to impress some of our readers the
curious feature of mr wells work is that it has
an enormous acceptance by the reading public and
so high is the degree of approval awarded him
that we feel that nis very name carries weight
one can criticize paradise lost there is a
fault in prosody in the first line but john milton
shows in his epic the veritable glories of the
english language so do not be too hard on mr
wells-editor

  about some of our authors

editor amazing stories

  having been one of your constant readers from
the first issue ill take the liberty to write you
a few of my ideas regarding your good magazine

  i am a lover of good scientifiction i especially
like interplanetary stories of all the different
worlds and distant universes i would be glad for
you to give us more of these kind of stories and
while on this subject let me ask you why dont you
publish some of the stories written by homer eon
flint i have read several of his planetary stories
and all of them i enjoyed reading i remember
in particular one of his stories that i liked very
much the planeteer this story was published
several years ago in another magazine in
argosy  or au-story magazine about  or
 i would enjoy reading this story again
and also some of his other stories can you print
this story and any of his others

  of the stories you have printed some of my
favorite authors are a merritt edgar rice bur-
roughs garrett p serviss and a few by h g
wells  the trouble with wells in some of his
stories is he uses too many words in describing
a situation and it becomes tiresome however
some of his stories are very good and his science
is usually good i consider station x one of
your best stories and as for your comedy stories
i consider your magazine is no place for them
none of them are interesting and i think most
of your readers will agree with me it will please
me if you will leave them out of your magazine
entirely and i have a suggestion to make you
and mr a merritt you have stated that mr
merritt will give us a sequel to his story the
face in the abyss why cant he combine this
sequel with another of his stories the moon
pool that was an excellent story and deserves
a sequel mr merritt could easily put the char-
acters of these two stories together into one real
good sequel covering both stories both stories are
somewhat similar in their texture science and

merrttsetting wiu you take this up with mr
 with best wishes for the success of your maga-
zine and hoping to see this letter printed in your
next issue and with your answers to my above
questions	charles knight

  we are sure that this letter will be read by
our authors with much interest and we will take

cattor amazing stories

  in the first place i wish to say how much
pleasure i derive from reading amazing stories
you could not have chosen a better title for
amazing they are some of them i read some
years ago the second deluge was very good
but others like the land that time forgot is
a great strain on the imagination for i should
say it was an utter impossibility for types of
fauna and flora of palaeozoic mesozoic and ceno-
zoic to be living at the same time i should
say that atmospheric conditions of the mesozoic
period was unfit for life of the cenozic to ex-
ist in life of the pliocene time to be in ex-
istence with the jurassic doesnt sound feasible
again as regards the astronomical writers whv
do they always give poor little mars such a bad
time simply because the planet is reddish in
tint doesn t necessarily mean it is of a sanguinary
disposition which all fiction in regard to it seems
to suggest the presumption is that being a
much older planet than the earth it is by thou-
sands of years more civilized if life exists at all
lake edgar rice burroughs latest brain wave
master mind of mars and all his other yarns
about mars it is nothing but battle murder and
sudden death besides having the most grotesque
forms of life imaginable tnere are men of pur-
ple green yellow and every color of the spectrum
dressed like roman warriors with short swords
and ye gods radium guns can you beat it
again consider the man who saved the
earth once more poor little mars she tried
to drain the atlantic ocean then we have h
g wells the war of the worlds this is an
old story but it is good fiction but at the same
time highly improbable i think mars is a very

  much maligned planet if there is a form of high
  intelligence on mars i dont suppose for one
  moment it bears the slightest resemblance to man
  mars being many millions of years in advance of
  the larth has presumably passed beyond the man
  stage of existence just as certainly as man will
  pass from earth to give place to an infinitely
  higher form of life and a beautiful form at that
  and not a monstrosity like h g wells would have
  us belieye in the law of evolution nature never
  retrogrades always advances it may possibly
  appear to retreat at times but it is for a pur-
  pose she re-advances with renewed energy i
  hope this letter has not bored you mr editor for
  i am earnest in my humble efforts and i cer-
  tainly do believe in an almighty intelligence which
  stands supreme this is my faith and my knowl-
  edge life is continuous and indestructible

  it is not safe to differentiate the climates of
  geologic eras too definitely undoubtedly in the
  carboniferous era conditions were very favorable
  to vegetable growth but there was much animal
  life then and it seems to be going too far to
  affirm that it was climate alone that controlled and
  governed the fauna and flora of past epochs in
  the worlds history we find man living in vari-
  ous climates on the present sphere the difference
  between the climate of the arctic zone and of the
  temperate zone and still more of the torrid zone
  is extremely great yet man lives in all of them
  on the coast of peru the natives are more fright-
  ened at a rainstorm which occurs perhaps once in
  several years than they are at an earthquake
  which visitations are extremely frequent there
  so man at least could have endured the climatic
  conditions of pretty nearly any of the ages you
  mention it is hard to say why mars is picked
  upon we say that nature never retrogrades
  is it not fair to say that humanity devoting its
  highest science to the development of lethal gases
  for the next world war and devising other methods
  of destroying human life preparing for war
  times of peace has been forced to take a retro-
  gressive step-editor-

a very short and sharp criticism
of h g wells

  editor amazing stories

    while reading the august number of amazing
  stories i became interested in h g wells
  war of the worlds i learned that a shot from
  a cannon was capable of putting a martian war
  machine out of commission ana as later it was
  found that it was impossible to use cannons why
  didnt they send out airplanes immediately
  after learning this fact i lost all interest in the
  story	s kaufman

                                 new york

    we suppose that the above letter may be con-
  sidered a sort of a metaphorical shot from a can-
  non to knock a very distinguished author from the
  pedestal on which thousands of admirers have
  placed him he may fairly be termed a present-
  day classic-editor

 a curious movement in florida-

amazing stories is a monthly

  editor amazing stories

    find the enclosed clipping from one of the
  newspapers to put it slangily they are all wet
  i refer generally to the opposition to h g wells
  i think some of his stories are the best that ive
  ever read i hope you continue inserting at least
  one in every issue

    i have procured your annual and was very well
  pleased with it i think such a book as that should
  be published every six months i for one would
  surely be eager to get it i especially liked the
  master mind of mars

     among the stories that i like best since i have
  been getting amazing stories are the following
  the moon pool the time machine the
  war of the worlds the green splotches the
  star of dead love i hcpe you put more of
  mr merritts work in the coming issues mr
  merritt deserves a merit for this story it was
  one of the best that you have published

    when i bought my annual i also asked for
  amazing stories for september and they said that
  you didnt publish one for september but that
  the annual came out in its place i think there
  must be a mistake isnt there i got so inter-
  ested in the war of the worlds and then found
  that i had such a long wait until the second in-
  stallment

    i am sixteen years old and have been taking
  amazing stories for about nine months im
  sorry i missed the first issues

    i	wish much success to amazing stories for the
  future

our october issue

  editor amazing stories

    i want to tell you my impressions of the oc-
  tober issue of amazing stories

    ray cummings story around the universe
  was delightful and but for one thing would be great

  i mean the feeling the reader gets that the author
  is laughing at him satire is different-it is laugh-
  ing at every one but yourself but somehow
  mr cummings gives me the atmosphere of ridicul-
  ing me on every page you know a reader is a selfish
  animal-the author must please him its a vague
  point though and the story was good inci-
  dentally more of the same type will be welcome

     wells is always the master  get tired eulogiz-
  ing hitn every mouth

     the winged doom was great gigantic thril-
  ling-again except for one thing the atmosphere
  is nothing more than a reproduction of anti-german
  propaganda during the war a scientific story-
  to be scientific-must be universal mr gilbert
  has done the same thing burroughs did in the
  land that time forgot and merritt in the
  moon pool  wish your authors would cut
  that out-the germans or mr gilberts unnamed
  future enemy that resembles the germans so much
  are human beings

     garret smith easily takes his place with bur-
  roughs for interest-and is less fantastic the
  story so far is good

    there seem to be some attraction to you mr j
  editor in a foreign story in the last issue you 
  had the malignant flower bv anthers from
  germany-poorly written and an idea too much 
  used now you have the p adise of the ice
  wilderness from norway vv-ich is only better i
  written you know i se great store by two
  things style and atmosphec

     your editorial was interesting but i take it
  with a grain of salt n that  believe a person
  must have a wide reading and must have thought
  of scientific and philosophic subjects on his -wn
  account in order to understand and appreciate and
  be safe from harming himself scientifically do
  you get me to be frank the e is harm in your
  magazine to one who has not the qualifications
  set out above science is not everything and the
  future is not everything g k chesterton sets
  this forth much better than i can in ivhats wrong
  with the world

    im not going to quit reading amazing stories
  just the same	abraham segal

                            philadelphia penna

     fan editor is always delighted when he is made
  the target for a well directed brickbat you
  will not harm yourself bv readint the stories we
  publish nor we believe will ny ot our other
  readers everything pu-flishet by us is fiction
  but there is science galoie in our pages and our
  magazine will be found to give a vast amount of
  scientific instruction your letter is thoroughly
  appreciated therefore as an enlightened criticism
  should always be whether we agree with the writer
  or not we are glad you like the paradoxical
  chesterton we are sure you will never stop read
  ing amazing stories-editor

   a reader in the far north

  editor amazing stories

    allow me to compliment you on publishing such
  a remarkable story the colour out of space
  it is one of the best i have read in your magazine
  for a long time

    although i am only twenty-one i have been
  very interested in scientific inventions and super-
  natural stories for the last ten years stories by
  edgar allan poe shx rhomer and other sensa-
  tional writers are my favorites and i have dabbled
  a little in electrical experiments unfortunately
  funds would not allow of my purchasing instru-
  ments which  required in a year or two i hope
  to be in a position where i can obtain certain in-
  struments with which to experiment

     may i offer a suggestion as to the contents of
  amazing stories why not have a one-page
  article every month on the construction of some
  piece of apparatus e g television telephotography
  etc giving particulars how to build a cheap yet
  working instrument right at the moment i cannot
  give you an idea as to the different apparatus which
  i would like to sec described but if you decide to
  commence such a series i could give you a list

     being so far from civilization up here  miles
  north of edmonton has a number of disadvan-
  tages if i require books or chemicals or apparatus
  i need to send outside for them and sometimes have
  to wait two weeks for them however i do not
  intend to be here very long and when i get down
  to a city i will start once more on my experiments

  it must lie four years now since i handled the
  junk of my experimenting apparatus and i look
  forward to the day when i can devote all my time
  to some work i have in view

     wishing you every success

                                  berwyn can

     we have gone nearly to the arctic circle for
  this great compliment bestowed upon the story
  entitled the colour out of space we are
  especially interested in a letter about this story
  because so many of our readers have expressed
  so many opinions about it how happy an editor
  would be if he could please everybody

    it is not impossible that your suggestion refer-
  ring to articles on constructing apparatus might be
  carried out but our sister magazine science and
  invention covers this field so thoroughly and so
  well and embodies the work of such distinguished
  authors that we feci that there is no need of our
  trespassing on its territory-editor

  a young readers good wishes

 editor amazing stories

    the object of this letter is to thank you for
 something i have always desired and that is a
 magazine like amazing stories

    i have been on this earth but fifteen years but
  ever since i was old enough to read  have had
  an unconquerable desire for scientifiction i soon
  had read all of jules verne h g wells e r
  burroughs and edgar a poe that treated on
  such class of fiction and was just getting to the
  point where i could find no more when the first
  issue of amazing stories came out it didnt
  take me long to discover it and since then i have
  been a steady reader of your excellent magazine

    i have a very vivid imagination and for this
 reason i like highly imaginative storses likfe
 the moon pool the land that time for-
 got a columbus of space station xm the
 visitation etc i would like to see more stories
 by e r burroughs and some by ray cummings

   however i like the slower type of h g
 wells and jules verne none the less and i cant
 agree with m fisher who in the august issue
 described the war of the worlds as rotten
 it is one of my favorite books

    am in favor of a semi-monthly and more
 and better illustrations but just so long as you
 keep your good work up to the high standard you
 have set i will be more than satisfied

   thanking you for your kind attention and
 wishing you every success patten jackson
 brookline mass

    a good proof of the merit of amazing stories
 can be found in the friendship which it has made
 with younger readers no magazine is so hard to
 edit as one for the younger generation and
 really successful ones may be taken as true classics
 this indefatigable reader does not agree with one
 of our critics about the war of the worlds
 the old proverb sas what is  one mans meat
 is another mans poison and this seems to apply
 to our stories-editor

our september issue

  editor amazing a stortes 

    being an invalid for some time at least i have
  nothing to do but read and as i am a book-worm
  i read anything i can find provided it is scien-
  tifically interesting i have bought amazing
  stories ever since it first came out and find it
  far better than any other magazine i have ever
  read

    i have enjoyed your discussions department
 very much and would like to offer some com-
 ments

  up to the september issue i have not found
            lplain  

           i expct  -t- i hp

  all right but the malignant flower and the

 much to complain about but the september issue

 wasnt what

 pectcd most of the stories were

  colour out of space were not good at all there
  was nothing of scientific value in the colour out
  of space it was a good story but it did not fit
  the standard of your magazine it had more of
  a weird ghostly trend

    i would like to see ray cummings stories re-
  printed from science and invention i noticed
  an amusing cartoon by briggs in the oakland
  tribune last night entitled someone is always
  taking the joy out of life it depicted a man
  who picked up a magazine and sat down to read
  it as he read further his interest was aroused
  and in the last picture he was having conniptions
  because it said to be continued in the next is-
  sue i have known people to lose interest and i
  myself have often lost interest in a magazine of
  that sort and have not bought the next issue i
  hope this will never be the case with amazing
  stories

     just finished reading e r burroughs story
  in the annual and i consider it a masterpiece
  also the face in the abyss is very good t
  should like very much to see sequels to both of
  them published soon

   just one more thing about the binding al
 though it can be laid flat on the table i would
 sooner lipid it open and be sure of having my
 back numbers whole with the covers attached
 as they are now they are too frail

    yours for semi-monthlies and semi-annuals

                     gordon w richmond
                     richmond calif

   we are glad to feel that amazing stories has
 done something to cheer the weary lot of an in-

 valid your appreciation is so warmly expressed
 that it repays us for the many hours of wfcrk
 which must be devoted to such a magazine as

 ours as regards the story entitled the colour
 out of space consujt the letters about this
 to see what others think of it our personal
 opinion of the malignant flower is that it is a
 particularly fine conception an elaborate de-
 scription of the sacrifice of one of the madagascar
 women lo such a flower forms the opening chapter
 of a book treating of the island continent of
 course it is not published in the book as a true
 story your favorable comment on the annual
 induces us to ask you to consider it a sort ot
 pledge for the future issues of amazing stories
