for several years he was just like a score of other
men in the plant-a good honest fairly capable
worker but only that there was nothing distinc-
tive about him or his ability-nothing to make him
stand out from the crowd-no reason as a matter
of fact why he should ever receive a raise
i then one fortunate day he decided that the
reason he wasnt getting anywhere was because he
lacked special training he searched around a bit
-asked a great many questions-and then en-
rolled for a home-study course with the inter-
national correspondence schools

   soon after i began studying he wrote to us
the other day we had a change in management
at our plant the new superintendent said that only

men who had really studied their work were ini
line for positions as foremen

  i certainly was glad then that i had decided to
study in my spare time for thanks to my i c s
course i was the only man in the organization who
could talk to the superintendent in his own lan-
guage as a result i was promoted over men who
had been here from ten to twenty years

  what are you doing with the hours after supper
can you afford to let them slip by unimproved
when you can easily make them mean so much

  one hour a day spent with the i c s in thd
quiet of your own home will prepare you for suc-
cess in the work you like best yes it taill put it

how do you know
 you cant write

have you ever tried	 -

   have you ever attempted even the least bit or
 training under competent guidance

   or have you been sitting back as it is so easy to
 do waiting for the day to come some time when you
 will awaken all of a sudden to the discovery i am
 a writer

   if the latter course is the one of your choosing
 you probably never iciu write lawyers must be law
 clerks doctors must be internes engineers must be
 draftsmen we all know that in our times the egg
 does come before the chicken

  it is seldom that any one becomes a writer until he
 or she has been writing for some time that is why
 so many authors and writers spring up out of the
 newspaper business the day-to-day necessity of
 writing-of gathering material about which to write
 -develops their talent their background and their
 confidence as nothing else could

   that is why the newspaper institute of america
 bases its writing instruction on journalism-con-
 tinuous writing--the training that has produced so
 many successful authors

jlearn to write by writing

 tvtgwspaper institute training is based on the
 new york copy-desk method it starts and keeps
 you writing in your own home on your own time
 week by week you receive actual assignments just as
 if you were right at work on a great metropolitan
 daily your writing is individually corrected and
 constructively criticized a group of men whose
 combined newspaper experience totals more than
  years are responsible for this instruction un-
 der such sympathetic guidance you will find that instead of
 vainly trying to copy some one elses writing tricks you are rapidly
 developing vour own distinctive self-flavored style-undergoing an
 experience that has a thrill to it and which at the same time de-
 velops in you the power to make your feelings articulate	

    many people who should be writing become awe-struck by fabulous
  stories about millionaire authors and therefore give little thought
  to the   and  or more that can often be earned for ma-
  terial that takes little time to write-stories articles on business
  fads travels sports recipes etc-things that can easily be turned
  out in leisure hours and often on the impulse of the moment

 how you start

    we have prepared a uniqtie writing aptitude test this tells
  you whether you possess the fundamental qualities necessary to
  succesful writing-acute observation dramatic instinct creative
  imagination etc youll enjoy taking this test the coupon will
  bring it without obligation newspaper institute of america

doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the
prescription cystex because of its splendid ingredients
and quick action for instance dr w r george
graduate medical dept university ol indiana former
health commissioner of indianapolis and medical di-
rector for insurance company  yean recently wrote
the following letter

there is little question but what properly func-
tioning kidney and bladder organs are vital to tbe
health insufficient kidney excretions are the cause of
much needless suffering with aching back weakness
painful joints and rheumatic pains headaches and a
general run-down exhausted body- this condition also
interferes with normal rest at night by causing the
sufferer to rise frequently for relief and results in
painful excretion itching smarting and burning i am
of tho opinion that cystex definitely corrects frequent
causes poor kidney functions of such conditions and
i have actually prescribed in my own practice for
many years past the same ingredients contained in
your formula cystex not only exerts a splendid in-
fluence in flushing poisons from the urinary tract but
also has an antiseptic action and assists in freeing the
blood of retained toxins believing as i do that so
meritorious a product deserves the endorsement of the
medical profession i am happy indeed to lend my
name and photograph for your use in advertising

  lo you can see how impossible it
allis rod finished jerkily his
eyes not quite meeting melinas
i thought you were - 

  some one rich and important
she supplied dryly and if you
hadnt seen the hurt in her dark eyes
you might have thought it didnt
matter that the man who had pro-
fessed his undying love for her not
two days ago was now backing out
lamely

  she looked away from his hands
fumbling nervously with the tiny
cup of after-dinner coffee outside

the plate-glass window of the quiet
side-street cafe the first eddying
wisps of fog circled about the street
lamps inside it was all warmth
and soft light-and heartbreak

  but cant you see what a fix im
in he protested his handsome face
sullen and darkened im poor i
cant afford to get mixed up with a
working girl

  melina inwardly shrank from the
harshness of his voice there was
no need of that

  she mused aloud because i had
the bridal suite ou the empress you
two in a fog



thought i was rich remember i
told you i had only been to bermuda
on business

  he shrugged impatiently i
thought you were kidding he mut-
tered

  there came the soft clatter of sil-
ver and china rising over the room
and from beyond the wide door the
muted clamor of traffic melina
shivered and picked up her purse

  why did you see me again
then she demanded curiously it
would have been easier to just-just
not show up

  rods lips tightened and for once
he didnt look quite so handsome

  how did i know what you might
do he said callously

  melinas smooth olive skin flushed
darkly and for a moment her lips
trembled then they parted in a
swift breath of anger

  i cant forgive you for that
she looked beautiful then brilliant
with fury alive with suppressed
emotion i may be one of those
fools who work for a living but im
not cheap if it had killed me i
should never have sought you out
her knees were lax with the fierce-
ness of her anger and for a moment
it looked as if she couldnt move
then she rose leaning for a second
on the table

  you have nothing to fear from
me she told him bitterly from
this moment on i dont know you
never knew you never expect to
know you

  he was on his feet too his face
white his lips curled

  which is  k with me he
muttered just as a slim dark man
with gray eyes under a shock of blue-
black hair strolled up to the table
and said mildly

  i see im just in time roddy my
boy to meet your charming dinner
guest

  rod turned his head jerkily and
melina saw him falter and then look
at her with a mingling of fear and
annoyance she read him correctly
in an instant this man who had
just come up was some one impor-
tant and rod hated to introduce
them

  it brought her head up proudly
and her softly rounded chin took on
a determined look

  so sorry-she moved a step
away-i must hurry

  but the gray-eyed man wasnt to
be put off so easily

  he put out a detaining hand if
you think i walked across this entire
room just to speak to rod landers
youre terribly mistaken and
again if you think i shall let you
run off without being introduced
then you dont know edward erin
omoore

  rod broke in hastily his voice al-
most fawning melina thought
how are you old man im just

back from bermuda-

  but edward erin omoore wasnt
paying him one seconds attention
from his considerable height he
was looking down at the averted
outline of melinas face

  now what is your name he
was demanding coolly i cant go
on calling you lady or lassie all
our lives

  rod was trying to break into a
situation that was rapidly growing
into a twosome with him very much
on the outside he cleared his
throat and essayed speech which
again fell on deaf ears

  i say omoore-

  melina lifted her eyes to the gray
ones just over her head

  my name is melina otis spauld-
ing and i work for a living she
said bitterly her glance drifting to
rods suddenly scarlet jace and then
back to the gray-eyed man she


street  smiths love story magazine

drew on her gloves slowly knowing
that if she hurried her hands would
tremble furiously and now if you

will let me pass-

  you may call me erin the
 gray-eyed man told her as he fell
into step beside her leaving rod
with a bare nod of his head i
rather like the name melina its
odd just a bit old-fashioned

   she was stumbling a little by then
because a sudden mist had come
over her eyes erin omoore took
her elbow lightly and guided her as
if it were the most natural thing in
the world  

 he pushed the door open and the
damp cottony fog rolled to meet
them somewhere on the way to the
street he had acquired a topcoat and
a battered felt hat and now while
melina hesitated blindly in the en-
trance he pulled the coat on

 shall we walk a bit he had
her arm again this time gripped
companionably tight to his side i
like the feel of the fog-its so damp-
ish and clammy sometimes look at
it against the lights

 slow burning tears were seeping
out from under melinas long lashes
there seemed no way to stop them
theyd been gathering a long while
-ever since rod had told her
brutally that their shipboard ro-
mance was ended almost before it
had begun

  the man at her side sensed the
tension across the cafe he had seen
enough in both pairs of eyes to un-
xlerstand

  you may as well get it out of
your system he said casually lead-
ing her across an intersecting street
where red and green lights were just
a colorful blur talk or yell its
the same -to me ive listened to
both in my time

  melina stiffened she had almost
forgotten that erin omoore was

there she had been so immersed in
her own misery

  she looked up at his profile
sharply cut against the drifting fog
and thought how different he was
from rod rod had perfect features
and a collar-ad smile but this man
with his almost beaklike nose and
twisted grin had something rod
never would have-something hard
to put ones finger on

   she said harshly wont it spoil
 your chances or something if some
 one sees you walking with a work-
 ing girl or is it that the fog will
 protect you

  go on he murmured equably
it starts amazingly well

   melina shivered and drew the fur
collar higher about her chin

   im sorry she said thickly but
 im all in the air ive just discov-
 ered that romance and the working
 girl doesnt mix despite the cinder-
 ella myth the movies are all
 wrong-so are magazines and
 novels everythings all wrong
 apple strudel he scoffed and
 then stopped suddenly against a post
 that had appeared from the mist
 shades of st patrick i just missed
 carving my nose on that blasted
 post

  they stood momentarily still
looking up at the dark outlines of
the iron post the fog had thick-
ened to a soupy consistency

  didnt know new york could go
london one better erin omoore
muttered listening to the continu-
ous hooting of cars half stalled in
the avenues wed best get out of
this for a while

   melina frowned slightly coming
alive to the problem of the moment

  where are we have you any
idea

  he dropped her arm and shinned
 rapidly up the iron post before she
could close her mouth his voice
two in a fog

 came down from the
 mist above

    were practically on
 my home street he
 slid down the post and
 wiped his hands with
 a large handkerchief

 would you share my
 fireside and a high ball
 for an hour or so las-
 sie or do i look dan-
 gerous

    melina hesitated she
 knew no matter where
 they were then that
 she was a long way
 from her one
 room apart-
 ment over-
  ooking the
 park rod had
 picked this cafe
 in which to
 dine with an
 eyeto its being
 out of the way

    im not ex-
 actly a good
 companion to-
 night she said
 restlessly id
 like to break
 dishes and
 things

   then erin
 omoore took
 her arm again
 and turned left
 into the side
 street that showed even
 darker than the avenue

   even that he as-
 sured her placidly

 might be arranged

 theres some old crock-
 ery in the kitchen that
 im tired of looking at

 youd be doing me a
 great favor if youd break--

and then melina laughed-a

 if you
 think i
 walked
 across
 this entire
 room just
 to speak
 to rod
 landers

   youre
  terribly
  mistaken
  and if
  you think
  i shall let
  you run
  off with-
  out being
  intro-
  duced
  then you
  dont
  know
  edward
  erin

 omoore

 iter to be sure but
nevertheless it was a step onward


street fc smiths love story magazine

  youre ridiculous

  i made you laugh

  is that something to crow over
she tried hard not to be bitter

  absolutely it shows you arent
too far gone to be saved

  then he led her into a low door-
way hospitably lighted by two old-
fashioned iron lanterns inclosing
electric bulbs the warm coziness of
a narrow entrance hall enveloped
them and the man led the way up
long white steps to a high door set
with brass knob and knocker

  -	my  domain-bowing low and
ushering her into a high-ceilinged
room that breathed of peace and
comfort 

  melina dropped her coat on a red
leather bench and looked appre-
ciatively about dark woodwork
and pale walls lighted by ivory-
shaded lamps that cast a subdued
light over bookcases built in half-
way to the ceiling leather chairs and
a fireplace scatter rugs worn and
velvety warm red drapes drawn
over sheer window curtains and the
gleam of brass here and there

  do you like it he asked eagerly
and looking at her eyes he knew
without words im glad he
added simply

 she sat down in front of the
smoldering fire and stretched slim
white hands toward the welcome
warmth while the man busied him-
self at the liquor cabinet

  so you met rod on the empress
he began casually over his shoulder
melina stiffened resentfully how
do you like the ship ive been on
her once or twice

  she relaxed feeling rather silly 
i liked it at first she admitted
with a burst of honesty i work
for the company and i had to do
some business for them down there
thats why i had the bridal suite
it was the only cabin not sold

  	erin omoore came over with a
glass for her so rod thought you
were at least miss empress he ven-
tured

  melina nodded -she knew sud-
denly she was going to tell him
everything she couldnt help it

  it was lovely while it lasted she
confessed thickly id never been
flirted with so expertly before he
made the two days heavenly i
hated to get back to new york
then--	

 he found out you werent a
bankers daughter right

  right she told him flatly and
then lifted her glass a toast to
the working girl

  may she discover that all men
arent alike he added swiftly and
they drank in silence

  he sat down opposite her  and
stretched with a sigh of relief toward
the heat

  this is something like it-tilt-
ing back his head and closing his
eyes-with the fog outside and
peace and a good companion inside

  melina relaxed under the spell of
his voice it was soothing com-
pelling in its very quietness she
found some of the misery stealing
from her heart and soul - every-
thing except this room this man
was far away and unreal

  eyes closed she let it all seep into
her blood and across the width of
the hearth erin omoore watched
her from under half-closed lids and
wondered at the faint stirrings in his
heart

  they were like this when there
came the muffled sound of voices
from below then the clatter of feet
and the sharp tap-tap of the
knocker

  the man frowned with annoyance
and sprang to his feet

  some pests i suppose to spoil a
perfect evening he groaned
two in a fog



  he crossed the room slowly and
flung open the door almost imme-
diately the air was filled with laugh-
ter and a feminine voice followed by
a familiar masculine one

  melina turned her head automati-
cally and looked straight into the
amazed eyes of rod

 edward erin omoore a
lovely red-haired girl in pale-green
satin dropped an ermine coat care-
lessly on the floor to give both hands
to the gray-eyed man youve
treated me shamefully not a call

not a line not a word-

  her glance slipped past him and
fixed itself sharply on- melinas
frozen face something jealous and
ugly flamed for a moment in the
topaz eyes of the newcomer

  oh im so sorry darling she
purred coming into the room eyes
frankly surveying melina if we

had known we were intruding-

  erin omoore sauntered behind
her not at all jada my own
were just hiding from the fog for
a bit this is miss spaulding-
miss van dykerman he looked
obliquely at rod shifting uneasily -
in the background i believe you
know mr landers

  melina smiled frostily no im
afraid not she said clearly how
do you do	

  jada slid gracefully onto the
hearth rug the faint light from the
fire making her hair sparkle show-
ing her skin to be even whiter than
it appeared

  its the fog that brought us in
she explained narrowing her eyes
seductively at erin omoore we
were on our way to the ritz and the
taxi bumped into a post at the cor-
ner here so here we are

  melinas nerves tingled from the
tip of her head to the end of her
little toe rod here in the same

room handsome and poised now
he was leaning against the mantel

  hope you dont mind old man
he was saying easily to erin but
jada would have it that we drop in
in on you

  guess i can stand it erin
drawled and jada laughed as though
he had complimented her

  yet her eyes when they sought
melinas were cold and just a bit
cruel

  and who are you darling she
demanded brightly

  at the liquor cabinet mixing
drinks erin omoore paused and
listened his generous mouth grim

  melina looked down at the other
girl at some other time perhaps
she might have felt ill at ease facing
an obvious society girl but now
somehow it was a matter of no im-
portance

  im a working girl she said
smoothly you should try it some-
time its good for the figure

  jada stiffened and the smile
wreathing her lips grew just a bit
forced

i dont think my figure needs it
she cooed do you think so erin

 he came over with two tall
glasses what reducing he
raised his brows well a bit off
the waist might help

  jada flushed darkly and drank
half her high ball in a furious gust
of anger

  rods eyes darkened and his lips
too tightened in anger-ranger at
melina she caught him glaring at
her when she lifted her eyes indif-
ferently to his face

 whats the matter mr
landers she asked coolly did
your drink go down the wrong
way

  erin omoore laughed suddenly
and went to turn on the radio

i think a bit of music might


street  smiths love story magazine

help he chuckled into a tense si-
lence

  the music that drifted so en-
chantingly into the room didnt help
much it served only to send jada
nearer erin and left rod uneasily
trying to carry on a one-sided con-
versation with melina

  melina sipped her drink and
gazed absent-mindedly into the
dying fire she was analyzing her
feelings sorting them out carefully
and laying them at her feet

  rod after that first amazing mo-
ment when he had walked into the
room had done nothing to her heart
except perhaps harden it a little
his obvious relief when she had ac-
cepted erin omoores introduction
filled her with contempt and
again his too obvious eagerness to
be with jada van dykerman was
overpoweringly offensive

  at this moment he was glancing
uneasily at jada sitting on a stool
at erins feet resting her lovely
white arms on his knees while she
tallied softly to him melina could
see the impotence of his anger surg-
ing within him

  whats the matter-she glanced 
up at rod carelessly-is your big
fish nibbling at another bait

  he flushed angrily and turned his
back on her

  i say jada-going to bend over
the red-haired girl-dont you 
think we could barge along i
imagine the fog has lifted a bit by
now	

  erin got to his feet and glanced
humorously across-at melina

 i hope the fog is thinning out
he said innocently

  but when he yrent to draw aside
the red drape the fog was even
worse it clung thickly to the
glass outside

  erin whistled looks worse he
muttered just as the radio inter-

rupting its dance program issued a
news bulletin

  the police department is send-
ing out a warning-the voice of the
announcer came with startling sud-
denness-that all those who are in-
doors remain there until the fog
lifts somewhat right now it is ex-
ceedingly dangerous in the streets
already there have been more than
a score of fatal accidents

  oh r jada sighed ecstatically
how delicious

  it is the worst fog ever to hit
new york went on the radio it
is due to lift sometime in the early-

morning hours until then-

  what rotten luck rod mut-
tered under his breath and kicked a
footstool out of his way

  erin raised his crooked dark
brows i should be the one to say
that me lad

  melina was on her feet staring
in bewilderment at her host then
that means i cant leave yet she
asked slowly

  erin omoore shook his head his
eyes kindling suddenly it will give
me the greatest pleasure to be your
host for a few hours longer

  jada tossed her head and slid her
hand through his arm taking his
speech as a direct compliment to
herself

  youre absolutely precious erin
darling its no wonder i love you
so terribly she purred

  but erin slid just as easily away
from her and crossed to a door
opening into another room you
love too easily jada me girl  tis
not the way of the irish

  any one would think youd been
born over there she pouted in-
stead of in new york itself

  he disappeared into the other
room and lights flashed on a mo-
ment later he was back

  there now girls-looking

ls-f
two in a fog



straight at melina-theres every-
thing handy foryou if you get tired
and want to rest there are clean
sheets on the bed clean towels on
the rack and pajamas slightly big
but serviceable if you want to
sleep

  melina looked at the clock on the
mantel why it was almost mid-
night already she should be in bed
now getting ready for to-morrows
work

  i think if you dont mind she
ventured ill take a nap

  erin came over and took her arm
his hand somehow compelling arrest

  is there any one you should
notify he wanted to know quietly

  she shook her head feeling some-
thing warm and comforting steal
into her heart

  no one at all

  she went into the other room just
as jada reached erin again and
drew his arm close about her waist

  cant you find a place for rod to
nap a bit she cooed then you
and i could talk

  melina heard erin omoore laugh
softly just before she closed the door
and because it was the tolerant
laugh of one who brushed away a
persistent insect melina was some-
how glad

  she looked about the bedroom it
was typically masculine-the dark
furniture that was severe yet com-
fortable the wide windows with
tailored curtains and off to one side
a sedate bath done in black and
white

  melina slipped off her dress and
hung it carefully on a rack then
she went into the bathroom to
luxuriate in steaming hot water and
faintly scented soap

  later feeling refreshed and
ready for sleep she entered the room
to find jada curled up on the foot of
the bed surveying her nails
ls-f

  after a moment she looked up
and stared shrewdly at melina
then she smiled slightly

  so youre a working girl she
murmured

  melina disliked her intensely 
she knew it definitely how

  yes she returned shortly
thinking how very beautiful the
other girl actually was in the mir-
ror she could see her own reflection
and to herself she looked plain and
shiny-faced

  i dont suppose you make an
awful lot jada went on i mean
you wouldnt turn up your nose at 
making a bit- of extra money would 
you

 faint alarm rang somewhere
within melina she stood quite still 
and watched jada through the glass

  what do you-mean she asked
sharply	

  jada uncoiled herself and stood
up if i made it worth your while
would you get out of here no ill
put it this way get out and ill -
make it worth your while she
looked at melina boldly challeng- 
ingly and if you dont get out
well it wont make much difference

  melina brushed her hair mechani-
cally while a string of bewildered
thoughts rushed through her mind

 what for she demanded
bluntly why should i risk break-
ing my neck in this fog

  jada drew in a sibilant breath and
her eyes were pieces of yellow flint

  i dont know why i bother to ex-
plain she said icily as if melina
were too insignificant a person to ad-
dress at all it just happens that i
want to be alone with mr omoore
and you are in my way now do
you understand

  challenging yellow eyes glared at
her insolently but somehow
melina wasnt much impressed

  oh she drawled so thats the


street  smiths love story magazine

in an instant melina had her dress on and was fastening it up while erin
pushed open the door and peered in ive decided not to take a nap
she said i think ill come in and keep you company

way they do it on the avenue
frame the man when you cant get
him otherwise

 jada gave a sudden furious

scream why you cheap little-

she seemed about to leap at melina
her gleaming nails curved for battle
but melinas slim white hands
reached out and gripped the others
narrow wrists holding them away
from her face

  for a long moment she stared at
her disgust in her eyes 

  if you think she began grimly
releasing her with a push that sent
jada stumbling back to the bed
that ill be a party to any scheme
of yours for trapping mr omoore
youre crazy

  jada sat up striving for non-
chalance youre making a play
for him yourself she sneered

  melina shrugged no im not
she said slowly but now that you
mention it he is worth fighting for
isnt he a charming person
two in a fog



  jada stood up her face ashily
pale you keep away from him do
you hear me she cried clenching
her teeth desperately hes mine
and no one else shall have him
melina dreamily surveyed herself
in the mirror he seemed to like
me she murmured hed be so

comfortable to live with-

  shut up jada shrieked and
then a knock sounded on the door

  hello in there erin omoores
voice came anxiously through
whats all the noise about

  in an instant melina had her
dress on and was fastening it up
while erin pushed open the door and
peered in his eyes sought hers
first and somewhere deep inside her
melina was glad

  it was she thought vaguely get-
ting to be a habit feeling glad about
erin omoore

  whats up he was asking his
eyes very intent though his voice
made his words of no consequence

  melina went to him without look-
ing at jada not a thing she as- 
sured him only ive decided not
to take a nap i think ill come in
and keep you company

  erin omoore grinned widely and
bowed low the best news ive had
since you decided to take a nap
enter lady fair

  rod was standing by the window
scowling out at the fog when
melina came in he turned and di-
rected his scowl at her but she
merely raised her brows madden-
ingly and strolled over to sit be-
fore the dead embers of the fire

  her host followed something bril-
liant yet soft glowing in his eyes
standing over her arms folded
across his chest he said simply

  it took those minutes out of my
sight to make me know

  melina flushed hotly and -then
wondered why across the room

rod cleared his throat loudly but
erin went on as if they were alone
i had begun to wonder about my-
self and you for some reason you
drew my eyes clear across the cafe
to-night i couldnt eat with the
same appetite afterward he
stopped and his eyes searched her
face intently	- 

  melina stirred restlessly she
felt strange taken up out of herself
something of what this man felt en-
tered her blood

  were strangers  she mur
mured you know nothing of me

  he flung up his head do any
of us ever truly know one another
even after years of living together
she mused on that remembering
things she had heard - they say
that-

  that there is no such thing as
love at first sight he put in
quickly perhaps there isnt his
eyes held hers but whatever this
is i feel for you if it isnt love it

might just as well be because-

  jadas voice issuing from the bed-
room interrupted him and melina
was conscious of quick resentment
she had to hear more

 rod come here will you
jada called and rod with a mut-
tered excuse disappeared into the
other room and closed the door
erin shrugged a lovely couple
melina smoothed her skirt care-
fully you were saying she
prompted casually-too casually

  and in an instant erin omoore
was kneeling at her feet so that he
could look up into her eyes his
whole face lit up with tenderness his
hands strong and steady on hers

  then you arent exactly bored
he asked gently even if you dont
believe in love at first sight 
melina took a deep breath it
was becoming difficult to breathe the
way she should it was being so


street  smiths love story magazine

 close to him she thought the
 strength of him flowing out robbed
 her of sane reasoning

    i-i didnt say i didnt believe in
 it she stammered a little its
 just well after all weve never
 seen each other before

 	he lifted her hands one by one
 and kissed them his lips lingering
 warmly on their coolness and his
 eyes never once left her face

im not rushing you he told
her im just warning you that
you may as well startthinking of
x me because one-day soon-youll have
to make upyour mind-

   nowheie a sound save the low
 murmur of his voice and the steady
 ticking of a clock and then break-
 ing the moment wide in two came
 rods voice and this time he called
 melina-	t

   -he stood in the door of the bed-
 room i wonder if youd come in
 and help jada he asked politely
 she doesnt feel so well

    melina- even while she moved to
 go into the room wondered there
 was something distinctly peculiar
 about this

    erin raised his brows inquiringly
 something more he muttered
 under his breath	x

   melina passed rod and saw jada
 lying across the bed her face buried
 in her arms she went over and
 asked

   whats the matter what can i

 do

   jada rolled over and sighed
 some water i think

   melina glanced at rod who had
 closed the bedroom door behind her
 then she went into the bathroom
 and got a glass the sound of the
 water running must have deadened
 the sound of rods steps for with-
 out even the  faintest warning
 melina looked up and saw him in
 the bathroom door

	listen melina  weve got to
talk he said urgently something of
his old fascination gleaming in his
eyes he had looked like this on
the empress melina thought re-
motely-eager and in love

  theres nothing more to say
she said thinly thats all over
and done with

  he came further in and half shut
the door it cant be over-not
the way i feel about you

  she stood backed against the
glass-inclosed shower whats got-
ten into you

  i love you thats what it is
he took-a long step that brought
him to her side im mad about
you it doesnt matter if you arent
rich- nothing matters except our
love

 our love she evaded his
hands and stepped back of the wash
bowl tell me when to laugh she
added bitterly

 he was so handsome-handsome
and weak and shallow melinasaw
him clearly in an ugly light and
what she saw she didnt like

  gome with- me now he begged
lets go to my place where we can
be alone ive so much to say
slowly she shook her head if
every word you uttered was worth
ten dollars you couldnt give me
two cents

  he flushed darkly and bit his lips
i canmake you change your mind
he warned sulkily were all alone
in here you know

  then melina knew what the trick
had been jada was probably pay-
ing rod well to keep her out of the
way while she worked on erin

  even as she thought it a scream
rang out from the other room
melina startedj but rod barred her
way

  its only jada doing her stuff
two in a fog		

he grinned unpleasantly erin
omoore will be glad to do whatever
she says when she gets through put-
ting on her act clever isnt she

           melina reached for the
glass she had put down
filled it calmly with water
and then before rod knew
what she was up to flung
it squarely in his face
and while he yelled and
blinked in the sudden
deluge she was around
him and into the bed-
room - - 

  it took only a moment
to cross to the living room
and then standing in the
door she looked -swiftly
about there was jada
standing open-mouthed in
the center of the floor
staring wildly about

 melina stared too
there was no erin
omoore-no oneat all there except
the two of them

  melina said dryly you may as
well put on your dress miss van

melina went
into the room
and looked
swiftly
about there
stood jada
melina said
dryly you
may as well
put on your
dress miss
van dyker-
man the ob-
ject of your
affections has
neglected to
remain


street  smiths love story magazine

dykerman the object of your
affections has neglected to remain
jada whirled to face the door
oh you-you little-- she
screamed just as a thundering
knock sounded on the door and an
authoritative voice demanded
open in the name of the law
melina looked questioriingly at
jada shall i or will you do the
honors

  jada grabbed up her dress and
flung it about her shoulders then
she flounced into the bedroom

  melina crossed to the door and
flung it open on two policemen

  whats going on in here the
first one growled we heard a
woman yelling

  melina raised her eyebrows
really she seemed amazed
you must have made a mistake in
the house officer no one screamed
in here she stepped back from
the door invitingly you may
come in if you  wish and look
around

  the first officer looked at the sec-
ond who shrugged

  well-the spokesman touched
his cap-we wont come in but
we wont be far away in case it
comes  again we aint taking
chances to-night what with the fog
and all

  melina closed the door behind
them and leaned weakly against it
for a moment

  get out of my way jada sailed
into the room her dress on again
and behind her stalked rod un-
comfortably wet and angry

  he refused to even look at melina
going straight for his hat and coat
and flinging them on hastily jada
threw her ermine about her shoul-
ders and tossed her head

  are you coming rod she de-
manded harshly  together they
marched through the door

  melina was alone then in the quiet
room-alone and wondering what
had happened to erin omoore

  psst a faint hissing drew her
attention to a corner near the win-
dows that was in deeper shadow
than the rest of the room 

   who-what-whos there she
called nervously beginning already
to back away toward the door

  are we alone it was erin
omoores voice and while she
looked around he stepped from be-
hind one of the red drapes his black
hair more tousled than ever and a
devilish twinkle in his eyes

  glory be he laughed softly
coming over to her to think that
a son of ireland should find himself
running away-hiding from a slip
of a girl

  melina dropped suddenly into the
nearest chair conscious of a strange
weakness about her legs

  i think she said weakly im
going to faint

  he was at her side in an instant
sober anxious darlin dont do
that i didnt mean to frighten you
come look at me

  her head slid to his shoulder as if
it had the right to be there and
when she lifted her lashes she could
look right into his eyes

  what happened she wanted to
know wonderingly

  his eyes twinkled again jada
pulled a beautiful scene worthy of a
better cause  all about love and
how no one would get me-you know
the sort of thing melina nodded
and when she started pulling off
her things welli just disappeared
a tiny chuckle began to ripple up
in melinas throat you should
have seen her face when i came in
he was serious then his eyes
somber what did rod do to you
in there i heard no sound

  melina edged away from him
two in a fog



he tried to sell me an old yarn
that wasnt worth a moments con-
sideration

  erin omoore studied her eyes at
length sure of that

  very slowly very seriously
melina nodded very sure

  he sighed abruptly and drew her
to her feet

  its time to be walking home
now he said his arms slipping
easily across her shoulders i have
much to say to you and i dare not
say it here  it is too easy to love
you

  his eyes dreamed down into hers
and somehow her heart rose lightly
to answer

j she smiled at-him tenderly

  do you think he asked wist-
fully there is a chance for me
 for answer melina reached up
and drew his head down and then
she kissed him lightly on both
cheeks he reached out for her con-

vulsively and then with main effort
drew back his arms

  if i touch you now he said
thickly adoringly ill never let
you go

 her arm slid about his neck
swiftly im thinking she whis-
pered amazingly that i wont want
to go

  he held her with fierce tenderness
cradling her close his lips tasting
the sweetness of hers lingering on
her cheek her eyes her hair they
remained so until finally an alien
note sounded from the dim outer
world-the clatter of milk bottles

  it is time my sweet to go home
now he held her aside with one
arm and reached for her coat with
the other but later-nine oclock
to be exact-we have an engage-
ment at the municipal building
am i right colleen

  always right dearest melina
sighed dreamily from his shoulder

everly standing on the bal-
cony outside the hotel room
sighed at the loveliness of the
night the moon was painting a
silvery dancing path on the lakes
dark surface soft strains of music
floated up from below and some-
where down there was that hand-
some dark-eyed young man whose
name she did not even know

-	she turned her head and called
arent you ready yet mother the
dancing in the grill has com-
menced

just a minute more darling 
beverly left the balcony and en-
tered the room where her mother
sat at the dressing table fastening
a rope of pearls about her throat
mother be sure to have that
young and beautiful



necklace put in the hotel safe to-
night reminded beverly you
forgot to last night and i was so
nervous i couldnt sleep

  you worry too much said mrs
fenwick gayly dont forget that
these pearls are insured for fifty
thousand dollars

 yes mother but a robbery
wouldnt be funny and youre so
careless about picking up new ac-
quaintances

  oh stop lecturing beverly
speaking of new acquaintances-
after dinner the hotel hostess in-
troduced me to that distinguished-
looking man we noticed in the din-
ing room his name is luis se-
bastian hes very charming and
what do you think he said to me
that he thought you and i
looked like sisters instead of mother
and daughter answered beverly
promptly

  how did you ever guess
good heavens mother dont
people say it wherever we go bev-
erly asked somewhat mournfully

  well yes they do smiled mrs
fenwick with a pleased look at her
reflection

  the glass mirroring their images
testified that mrs fenwick and her
nineteen-year-old daughter did in-
deed look like sisters beverlys fig-
ure was no slenderer in her white
evening gown than her mothers in
a blue one mrs fenwicks hair
due to daily treatment was an even
more lustrous gold than that of her
daughter the mothers eyes were
a light blue while beverlys eyes
shaded toward violet

  both had the gorgeous com-
plexions that go with such fair col-
oring both were beautiful mrs
fenwicks beauty was doll-like and
dainty compared with the healthy
glowing attractiveness of her daugh-
ter

  really mr sebastian is very in-
teresting mrs fenwick went on
he has traveled all over the world
and hes a delightful talker and
oh by the way i also met that ath-
ietic-looking young man

  which one do you mean bev-
erly spoke calmly but her heart
gave a queer little flipflop of an-
ticipation	

  you know-the only other at-
tractive man in the hotel the
quiet one whos been sitting shyly
on the porch reading his name
is gordon larrimore what do you
say beverly we go down now
gather him and mr sebastian in
and hint that they take us to the 
grill for dancing

  mother beverly was partly
thrilled partly apprehensive
please dont ask them outright
of course not laughed mrs
fenwick leave it to me to be
subtle and stop looking so wor-
ried sometimes i feel youre ten
years older than i

  beverly selecting a wrap sighed
she felt the same way her mother
seemed so irresponsible it was nice
to have a young beautiful mother
but sometimes she envied other
girls girls who had stout middle-
aged mothers with graying hair-
mothers who were not always sur-
rounded by fascinated young men
who did not eclipse their shy youngs
daughters

  beverly was not unsympathetic
with her mothers keen enjoyment of
being youngish and sought-after
she knew that mrs fenwick mar-
ried when very young to a man
twenty years her senior had for
years led a dull existence it was
only several years ago that left a
widow with a good income she had
really blossomed out and begun to
enjoy life

  because of her earlier repression


street  smiths love story magazine

mrs fenwick now craved gayety in
deep gulps she wanted to make up
for the lost years of youth she rev-
eled in the admiration of younger
men beverly often squirmed un-
comfortably feeling that her mother
was a bit too frivolous especially
when enlivened by an extrii cock-
tail she lived in constant dread of
mrs fenwicks becoming too fool-
ish over some romantic youth

  fifteen minutes after they went
down to the lobby due to skillful
maneuvers on mrs fenwicks part
mother and daughter were seated in
the grill with them were gordon
larrimore and luis sebastian

   while her mother chattered gayly
beverly quietly studied the two
men both had dark hair but gor-
dons was dark-brown and crisp
while sebastians was dark and
sleek sebastians eyes were black
and penetrating  gordons were
hazel and had a glint of humor in
them  sebiastian might be the
handsomer but she preferred gor-
dons  bronzed broad-shouldered
good looks

 as the orchestra struck up both
men turned to ask mrs fenwick
-for the first dance beverly was
used to that she was delighted to
xsee her mother choose sebastian as
a partner she felt a sense of de-
licious contentment as she and gor-
don glided out upon the dance floor

  his first words however robbed
the moment of its pleasure

  you have a very beautiful
mother he observed his eyes
were following mrs fenwick and
sebastian

  you thrill me answered bev-
erly do you always say such
charming things

  he looked a trifle confused as he
met her gaze

  well i was about to add that
you greatly resemble her in fact

when i first saw you together i
thought-

  that we were sisters finished
beverly youre only the nine
hundred and fiftieth man to say
that

  his eyes twinkled she felt that
he perceived her inner exasperation
then im not being very original
am i i might as well say all the
usual things how do you like it
here at this quiet lake resort
theres lots to do she told him
boating swimming riding tennis
how are you ait those things
only fair he replied sounds
too energetic for one who has come
from an office for a few days rest
she felt chagrined his whole ap-
pearance suggested a love of the
outdoors the average young man
would have eagerly sought her com-
pany in a round of sports why did
he evade her-she wondered her
heart sank at the thought that per-
haps his interest was all for her fas-
cinating mother 

  her suspicions were borne out by
the alacrity with which he asked
mrs fenwick for the following
dance for the next hour he and
sebastian alternated in dancing with
mother and daughter beverly had
the all-too-familiar sensation of be
ing an outsider at the party her
vivacious mother dominated the
scene and claimed most of the two
mens attention

  youre so silent to-night bev-
erly remarked mrs fenwick dur-
ing an interval between numbers
i have a very quiet daughter gen-
tlemen she throws the whole bur-
den of conversation on me

  she is listening to you and learn-
ing declared sebastian with an
arch glance and she is a lucky
girl to have such a charming in-
structress 
young and beautiful



beverly decided that she could not en-
dure to watch gordon acting like other
young men who had fallen under her
mothers spell i have a headache  she
announced if youll excuse me ill go
to my room

  flatterer said mrs fenwick
who loved compliments dont
europeans say the sweetest things
mr larrimore

gordon smiled at her who
wouldnt with you as an inspiration
mrs fenwick

her mother-beamed with pleasure
and beverly decided that she could
stand no more she rose from the
table she could not endure to
watch gordon acting like other
young men who had fallen under her
mothers spell

i have a headache she an-
nounced if youll excuse me i
think ill take a stroll in the gar-
den before going to my room

the men rose politely and her
eyes met those of gordon his were
regretful and for a fleeting second
she fancied he was about to accom-
pany her then his gaze dropped
and she left the room alone there
were tears of vexation-and some-
thing deeper than vexation-in her
eyes

  beverly breakfasted alone the
next morning she liked to go for
a canter before the sun was high

mrs fenwick seldom arose before
ten oclock

  as she was leaving the dining
room beverly met gordon coming
in his eyes widened at sight of her
in her trim white riding habit she
looked her charming youthful best
and she knew it

  he stammered a good morning
and added youre really dazzling
miss fenwick if you dont mind my
saying so

  i dont she smiled wickedly
youre complimentary to mothers
and daughters both i see how do
you get on with grandmothers

   he looked taken aback at her sar-
casm then his jaw squared grimly
oh im a riot in an old ladies
home would you like tohear my
memoirs sometime

  of course she returned some
rainy day by the fireside and you
can wear yoiir slippers and relax

  then she went out to where the
groom stood with her horse mount-
ing she galloped along the bridle
trail that circled the lake the
fresh morning air brightened her
eyes-ancf stung vivid color into her
cheeks it would have been per-
fect if gordon had been riding with
her

  she kept remembering the baffled
look on his face her gibes had
hurt him well if she could hurt
him perhaps he was not indifferent
to her there had been undisguised
admiration in his eyes too no-doubt
of that

  but the glow induced by these
thoughts vanished two hours later
as she rode back to the hotel she
heard the gay voices of approaching
riders through the trees her
mother galloped into sight and rid-
ing with her were gordon and se-
bastian

  beverly smilingly returned the
greetings of her mother and sebas-

tian but her face froze a little as
she met gordons pleasant smile

   so you finally tottered out into
 the sunshine she said as if ad-
 dressing a whitebearded old man

   this time he refused tolook hurt
 he reined in come along with
 us he invited and ill race you
  five miles little one

   no thanks she declined you
might -collapse and not be able to
play checkers to-night

  a spark leaped into his eyes
look out i might take the pre-
rogative of the elders you class me
with and give you the spanking you
need

   she laughed tantalizingly happy
to see him stung by what she had
said

   it isnt that i class you with my
 elders she returned its that you
 cant tear yourself away from them
 and its beginning to get you
 youre aging right before my eyes

   as he started to reply an impulse-
 of deviltry seized her raising her
 riding crop she brought it down
 sharply on his horses flank the
 startled animal bolted giving him
 plenty to do to manage it looking
 after him she saw by the way he got
 the mount under control that he was
 an accomplished horseman

   she rode back to the hotel won-
dering what had possessed her to
act like that was it love was it
love that made her so exasperated
at gordon that she felt she hated
him yet wanted to be in his arms
did love make you so wistful and
unhappy and yet so thrilly inside
of you

   after lunch beverly arranged to
have a canoe held for her at the
landing she hoped that gordon
would seeher embarking perhaps
it was this thought that led her to
don her most becoming-and dar-
ing-bathing suit
young and beautiful



  to her joy gordon was stand-
ing on the side porch as she went
toward the landing she pretended
not to see him until he hailed her

  not going swimming in that icy
lake are you

  pausing she looked up she had
seen the eyes of many men widen
with keen admiration at sight of her
in a bathing suit but to se such
a look on his face fairly made her
tingle

  im going to paddle my own
canoe she said that is unless
i can find a strong man to help me
howd you like to ship on a voyage
around the lake

  im awfully sorry j deepen-
ing warmth of sincerity was in his
tone but ive promised to make
a fourth at bridge with mr sebas-
tian your mother and another
lady

  oh she caught her breath
and again exasperation swept over
her if his eyes really meant what
they said why was he always at her
mothers side

  better be careful she advised
him mockingly youll be tired
out lifting those heavy cards i
dont know how you stand the
jpace 

   he glared down at her it isnt
only your canoe that needs pad-
dling he growled for a moment
she thought he was going to vault
the railing and carry out his threat

   then he glanced out over the lake
and his expression changed lots
of whitecaps on the water dont
you think its too choppy to go ca-
noeing

   maybe for bridge players bev-
erly retorted but i dont think
so

  she swung on her heel and walked
away disappointed that heajled no
reply after her as she starteapad-
dling from shore she could see him

on the porch watching her then
he went inside during the next
two hours he reappeared at inter-
vals no doubt when he was dummy
she derived some satisfaction from
believing that he was following her
with his eyes

  pride alone kept her on the lake
after the first half hour the water
was choppy and the wind had a
knifelike edge but she felt that
to go ashore would be admitting that
gordon had been right

  presently the wind increased and
she decided  to turn back she
veered too sharply however letting
the canoes bow leap out of the
water the swirling waves rushed
under it and beverly found herself
in the lake with the canoe capsized

  the water was icy-cold but after
she caught her breath she was not
alarmed she was an excellent
swimmer about to start for shore
she glanced toward the hotel there
on the porch stood gordons famil-
iar figure knowing that she was
cleanly visible to him she sent out
a long piercing scream

  she saw him leap the railing and
run to the landing there he re-
moved his coat kicked off his shoes
and dived into the lake as he cut
through the water toward her with
long strong strokes she perceived
that he was an exceptionally good
swimmer

  nearing the capsized canoe to
which she clung he blinked the wa-
ter from his eyes and called
hoarsely miss fenwick bev-
erly are you all right

  never better she responded
cheerfully it was nice of you to
swim out and visit me

  she smiled gayly at him his face
grew grim- as treading water he
stared at her

  you dont seem to need help he

said ominously what was all the anxious face of her mother and the
screaming for	cduiitenance of the hotel physician

  i wanted- to see if youd leave im sorry she whispered weakly
your  bridge game she asserted to gordon

now that youre here ill race you he smiled softly and let his hands
back to shore	come away from her slowly reluc-

  for answer he lunged toward her tantly then he stepped aside for
the next moment beverly was the doctor

grasped in his strong arms placed beverly emerged from the esca-
faoe down against the overturned pade with nothing worse than a se-
canoe and spanked twice stingingly vere cold she was forced to keep

to her room for the rest
of the week ordinarily
this would have been
hard enough on her
active temperament
now it meant not see-
ing gordon and that
made it ten times worse

  he sent her a large
bouquet of flowers and
she was thrilled almost
totears there was no
florist at the resort
she realized that he
must have plucked
those wild flowers after
hours of tramping
away and let me alone you brute about the slopes they wilted in a
im going with you he an- day but she would not have them
nounced resolutely	thrown out his flowers

  if the water had not been so icy after dining in her room several
beverly would have remained there nights  later she announced
obstinately but she was becoming mother i feel well enough to go
chilled she struck out for shore at downstairs this evening in fact i
her fastest pace hoping to outdis- could stand a couple of hours of
tance him to her irritation he dancing

dizzy she turned a puzzled help- once he trails me everywhere i go
less look toward gordon he swam  and i havent had five minutes alone
closer to her his brawny arm went with that fascinating mr sebas-
across her shoulders and she sighed tian

then she lost consciousness	really said beverly faintly

                                her mother had no idea how her
when she opened her eyes gor- wordsre at the girls heart so
don was lowering her gently into her he was still pursuing her mother

when he released her

cried how dared you
do that to me

attentions mrs fenwick rattled
on he and sebastian are both
handsome both interesting--
and both years younger than
you especially gordon finished
beverly i hope youre not tak-
ing either of them seriously

  there you go always remind-
ing me of my age her mother
pouted other people dont think
im as ancient as you do beverly
im only five or six years oldefthan
luis sebastian and i dont look it
sometimesi think youre jealous be-
cause men seem to prefer my
beauty

  im not jealous mother bev-
erly protested nevertheless she
felt a twinge of conscience she
never had been jealous until gor-
don appeared but i wish youd
become interested in older men like
our lawyer who has adored you for
years im always afraid youll get
silly over some young man and

then--

  her voice trailed off mrs fen-
wick burst into tears

you begrudge my having any
fun in life ill be old soon enough
i think its horrid of you beverly
beverly sighed her mother was
just like a child

  im sorry mother lets forget
it she said putting her arms about
the older woman affectionately all
such scenes inevitably ended with
beverly apologetic and remorseful

  mrs fenwick dabbing at her
eyes took advantage of her daugh-
ters softened mood

  darling do something for me
wont you were leaving to-mor-
row so thisis the last night i can
spend with luis

  what can i do asked beverly
wonderingly

  you can get rid of gordon for
me when you see him in the lobby
tell him fm staying in my room for

the evening then ill phone luiss
room and well steal away to the
lakeside casino for a few dances
beverly hesitated and her mother
reading her thoughts urged her
please dear ill enjoy it so ill
probably never see him again and
i promise not to drink more than
two cocktails

  all right mother ill do it
promised beverly she felt a cer-
tain pleasure in the thought that
though she did not relish the decep-
tion it would enable her to have
gordon to - herself for a last few
hours

  he was not in the lobby when
beverly stepped from the elevator
sebastian was there however

  you are charming this evening
miss fenwick he said bowing his
gaze traveled over her lithe form in
its close-fitting gown of jade green
you are like a goddess of the dance
all green and gold

  beverly smiled coldly she did
not like his bold eyes  they made
her feel creepy

  mother has not come down yet
she informed him abruptly she is
still in her room

  he smirked complacently as if
there were some secret understand-
ing between them then he bowed
and left the lobby

  a moment later gordon sauntered
in her heart leaped at his ap-
proach

  being confined to your room has
improved your looks if that were
possible he smiled golden hair
-green gown-blue eyes reflecting
the green-i call it bewitching
where sebastians compliments
had repelled her gordons words
caused her to glow with inner hap-
piness

  youre looking quite fit your-
self she said how you stand up


street  smiths love story magazine

under bridge and other indoor ath-
letics i dont know

  are you going to start that
again he groaned his eyes went
past her to the elevators how is
your mother this evening

 this query set beverlys teeth on
edge and are you going to start
that now suppose i ask about
your parents  then well inquire
after each others grandparents and
settle down to a cozy chat about
the civil war

  youre a brat he muttered
but there was a touch of embarrass-
ment in his manner that made her
take pity on him 

  mother asked me to tell her pub-
lic that she will stay in her room 
this evening she told him keeping
as close to the truth as possible

  really his face lighted with
apparent relief it puzzled her

  that was her message can i
help you to kill a lonely evening at
dominoes or checkers

  instead of being annoyed he-
broke into laughter

	you have a lovely sense of hu-
mor i like it he asserted lets
declare a truce and go down to the
grill and dance

  fine she accepted enthusiasti-
cally

 they danced until near midnight
the hours passed like a roseate rap-
turous dream to beverly at last
she had gordon all to herself he
proved a delightful companion-a
perfect one she thought for she
was gloriously completely in love
with him and she admitted it to
herself without reservation

 and it seemed to her that his
feeling toward her was more than
casual a man reveals so much
when he looks in a certain way at
a girl keeps his eyes on her alone
trembles when his hand touches
hers as the evening wore on they

became a little graver a little shyer
with each other as if deep emotions
were surging within them

  lets take a turn in the air he
suggested finally 

  they went out to the terrace arid
around to the deserted porch of the
hotel an intimate silence fell be-
tween them as they gazed out over
the moonlit waters of the lake

  i wonder what is at the end of
that moonglade beverly mused at
last is it like a rainbow do you
think	s

  he looked at the long path of sil-
ver stretching to the horizon no
theres no pot of gold there ill
tell you what i think if we could
reach the moonglades end wed find
the answer to our dreams what
would yours be

  she met his glance intently chal-
lenging

  i hope you wont laugh she
said what id want to find there
would be just a home

  just a home he stared in sur-
prise 

  yes it neednt be a big one
nor a grand one but a home a
real home you see mother and i
travel from hotel to hotel she
loves it but im deathly tired of it
so i dream of a home of my own

  she was really afraid he might be
amused but he looked at her with
deepening approval and his voice
was tender when he spoke

  i like that he declared a
home but wouldnt you want
some one to share it with you bev-
erly

  he was gazing intently at her
a strange timidity assailed her and
she could not raise her eyes to his
how could she let him read what
was so plainly written there

  youre asking too many ques-
tions she parried suppose you
answer one what dream would you

ls-f
young and beautiful



sheclutched at his arm almost frantically gordon i dont understand
you she cried what can it matter to you if my mother is out with
luis sebastian but gordon freed his arm and ran to his car

hope to find answered at the end of
the moonglade

  it was his turn to display a sort
of shyness

  the answer to my dream his
voice was hesitant but vibrant with

rising emotion well-

  a sudden gust of wind came from
the lake and beverly pulled her
wrap closer about her his hands
went out to help her she felt his
fingers trembling at her shoulders
ls-f

as his hands hovered reluctant to
draw away almost insensibly she
swayed toward him then his arms
went about her and he drew her to
him and held her close -

  she raised her eyes to his and
then swiftly crushingly his lips
were on hers he kissed her again
and again as though he could never
have enough she returned his
kisses afloat in a warm sea of lan-
guorous delight athrill with the con-


street  smiths love story magazine

tented rapture of love given and
returned

  at last breathless she drew back
with a -smile and a faint shake of her
head now she wanted to have him
speak to put his endearments into
words

  he gazed down at her his eyes
melting into hers

  thats the answer to my dreams
darling he began you in my

arms and-

  footsteps behind them made him
pause beverly drew away from him
as some one came up the steps it
was the young assistant manager of
the hotel

  oh good evening miss fen
wick he murmured and mr
larrimore how are you

  he looked fully- as embarrassed as
they over having interrupted their
tete-a-tete trying to ease the situa-
tion he paused and turned just be-
fore he entered the lobby

  i saw that charming mother of
yours at the casing he said to
beverly she was certainly enjoy-
ing herself

  then he left them blissfully igno-
rant of having hurled a verbal bomb-
shell	-

  gordons manner underwent a
complete change he looked at bev-
erly accusingly his brows knitting
together i thought you said your
mother was staying in her room

 thats what she wanted me to
say explained beverly but in-
stead she went to the lakeside

casino with-

  with sebastian he burst out
and she nodded wondering at his
vehemence then to her greater
astonishment he started across to-
ward the steps

  bewildered she clutched- at his
arm almost frantically

  gordon i dont understand
you she cried her voice breaking

what can it matter to you what

my mother does if-

  but with an impatient shake of
his head he freed his arm and fairly 
ran down the steps and around the
drive toward the hotel garage two
minutes later he roared past the
porch in his roadster the sound of
his motor died away in the direc-
tion of the casino

  beverly moving as in a dream
went down the steps and gazed
blankly after him so rapidly had
shock followed shock that she was
still dry-eyed hurt to numbness

  so he had made love to her only
in the absence of her mother and
the moment he had learned where
her mother was he had flung off
after her

  great sobs began to shake the
girls slender body like a wounded
thing she wandered into-the hotel
garden and flinging herself upon a
bench gave way to her heartbreak
and humiliation

  half an hour later her grief mo-
mentarily spent beverly rose wea-
rily from the bench she entered
the hotel by a rear door not want-
ing any one to see her stricken face
and swollen eyelids	

  she found herself in the unlighted
sun parlor off this room a rear
staircase led to the upper floors she
was moving across the room feeling
her way when two persons entered
at the side door from the porch

  she drew back into the shadows
the porch light fell on the pair who
had come in her mother and se-
bastian she smiled bitterly at the
realization that gordon had evi-
dently missed them then she drew
in her breath sharply as she saw that
her mother was walking a little un-
steadily	

  i feel funny said mrs fen-
young and beautiful



wick pausing near the door what
was in that last cocktail i drank
luis

  nothing that wasnt good for
you sebastian assured her suavely
perhaps youd best sit down a sec-
ond

  he assisted mrs fenwick to a
chaise longue her head sank
back she murmured something then
sank into deep slumber

  with quick catlike movements
sebastian bent over her and re-
moved the pearl necklace
from her throat he was
hurrying toward the door
when beverly stepped
from the shadows

 just a minute mr

sebastian where do you think you
are going with those pearls

startled he wheeled toward her
at thesame instant his hand flashed
up pointing a revolver at her

oh its you miss fenwick
kindly dont raise your voice or i

with quick movements sebastian removed the pearl necklace from mrs
fenwicks throat then beverly stepped from the shadows just a
minute mr sebastian where do you think you are going with those

pearls

 shall have to do something regret-
 table just turn your back to me
 and put both hands behind you

   there was no mistaking the steely
 menace in his low tones  beverly
 did as he ordered hastily he tore
 some pull cords from the window
 drapes and tied her hands and feet
 then he turned her around to gag
 her with a handkerchief

   behind him she saw suddenly a
 mans form blocking the doorway
 her  heart gave a leap as she rec-
 ognized gordon the next moment
 he sprang across the intervening
 space and hurled his six feet of
 weight and muscle upon sebastian

   sebastian struggled fiercely but
 once the revolver was wrested from
 his grasp he was at the mercy of
  the stronger man by the time ho-
 tel attendants rushed to the scene
 gordon had-his opponent down

    beverly sighed and then did a sur-
 prising thing for a healthy athletic
 girl she quietly fainted

   it was the following morning in
 the sitting room of the fenwicks
 suite

   you see explained gordon
 my father is president of the zenith
 insurance co im a member of the
 firm in charge of the operatives-
 the detectives who investigate jewel
 thefts

   i begin to see said beverly
 her eyes were shining as she
 watched him pace the room while he
 talked

   i came here for a few days
 rest jhe went on then i saw
 this fellow sebastian- hanging around
 your mother i recognized him as
 a man we had had under suspicion
 in a recent robbery so what could
 i do your mothers jewels were
 insured by our company it be-

 came my duty to stick close to her
 and sebastian i couldnt arrest
 him until he did something crimi-
 nal	 -

  sothats why you left me she
murmured right in the middle
of-

  of telling you iloved you yes
i knew your mother was indanger
and there was no time to lose i
reached the casino after she and
sebastian had left trailed them back
here and caught him red-handed
he came across the room now and
took her hands in his looking down
at her-tenderly	

  may i go on where i left off
darling and tell you that i love
you adore you want you that
from the moment i saw you i knew
you were the answer to all my
dreams

  i wiant to hear it all she
breathed  over and over again
but first hold me tight and kiss
me

  he took her in his arms and she-
gave herself up utterly to the sweet
delicious rapture of his kiss

  a voice behind them finally broke
in upon their blissful oblivion

  you make a sweet couple said -
mrs fenwick from the doorway
she came toward them smilingly

  how disillusioned i was she
continued lightly thinking two
young men were fascinated by me
when one wanted my pearls and the
other only wished to protect me
oh mother dont you mind ex-
claimed beverly embracing her
sympathetically

 no sympathy needed my dear
im cured ive just accepted my
lawyers proposal of marriage over
the telephone well have a gorgeous
double wedding beverly

chapter vii

janice woke and lay gazing at
the pale shaft of sunlight strug-
gling in between the drawn
satin damask curtains of her bed-
room windows at first sleep still
lay heavy on her lids misting her
brain then memory flooded back

  last night had been the night of
the play and the supper dance

  had she dreamed it or had that
scene in her husbands room really
happened

 she closed her eyes and lay
breathing quickly her hands pressed
against her madly beating heart
she could hear again the murmur
of her-husbands voice whispering
his love could feel the pressure of
his arms as they held her the throb
of his kisses oil her throat against
her lips

  she had believed that she would
give years of her life to know that
he loved her for one hour-and she
had had her hour of ecstasy

  she had taken the love which was


street  smiths love story magazine

hers by right yet the love she had
taken had been meant for another
girl	

   because of the remains of the fe-
ver that was upon him and the drugs
he had been obliged to take during
the day he had mistaken her for
gina mornington

  what would he think if he ever
found out the truth she had been
 mad-mad

  yet the memory
of that madness
thrilled her from
head to foot and
she knew that no
matter what price
she paid she would
never really regret

   if out of all her
life she was to have
no more than that
one hour-at least
it could never be
taken from her

  but she was bit-
terly ashamed when
she thought of what
the man she loved
would think of her
if he ever knew he
must never know
she was determined
on that point

  but how was she
going to face him

  she prayed that
he might be remaining in his room
that day-anyhow until she had
more time to collect her courage

  presently the maid brought her
morning coffee explaining that she
served it late as she knew that
janice must have been very tired
the night before

  janice bade the girl dravv her
bath but she was very slow get-
ting dressed and finally ordered
breakfast to be brought up to her
own room somehow she dreaded

going down that morning even
though she believed that her hus-
band was still in his room

  but when she did go down she
opened the library door and saw her
husband seated at his desk looking
through some papers

  he still looked ill but the signs
of fever had gone as- he glanced
up and saw her he gave a start

  hello janice
he exclaimed how
did everything go
she noticed for
the first time his
eyes did not meet
hers and her heart
missed a beat

  it needed a great
effort to make her
voice sound steady
as she moved for-
ward

  everything went
off very success-
fully thanks she
replied but i
dont think that
you ought to be
downstairs you
were very ill yester-
day  

 lie made an im-
patient movement

  ive had attacks
like that before i
can shake them off
if there is anything i loathe it is
staying in my bedroom i am all
right to-day-except that my head-
is a little woozy from so much qui-
nine

  she turned away and looked out
of the window

  well you know best how you
feel yourself she replied i must
go into town this morning gan i
do anything for you while im down
there

  he hesitated

the story so far jan-
ice temple out of a job is
returning- to her home town
when on the train she meets
roger greville who has just
been jilted by his fiancee gina
mornington hating to tell his
father who has never seen
gina what has happened he
persuades janice to pose as his
fiancee for a month rogers
father has a stroke and before
he dies he begs roger to marry
janice after the old mans
death roger insists that they
pretend that they are happily
married he also forbids her
to continue her friendship with
sefton arlen a neighbor friend
roger and janice become jgood
friends and janice hopes that
roger is learning to love her
when gina mornington returns
determined to win roger for
herself roger comes down
with an attack of fever and
janice is with him when he 
takes her in his arms and kisses
her telling her he loves her

 but calling her gina
midnight madness



  if you dont mind leaving a
package with lawrence  nyes he
said there are some papers they
wanted my signature to

  lawrence  nye were the family
lawyers

  janice was glad that she really
had an excuse to go into the town
for apart from his errand she had
nothing to do there at all but she
felt that she could not stay indoors
could not bear to be alone with
roger lest she should betray herself

  she loved him so much and in
spite of everything she was less than
nothing to him the knowledge was
double torture now

  when she had gone he sat star-
ing in front of him his hands
clenched he too was tortured-
tortured by uncertainty which if it
were turned into certainty he felt
would be still greater agony

  but he told himself it couldnt be
true

  gina mornington could not have
come to him last night-the memo-
ries which haunted him were just a
dream

  he reached for a book and open-
ing it tried to read but he could
not do so all the time a girls
face came between him and the
printed page

  it was not the face of the girl he
believed he loved but of the girl
whom he had made his wife

  he shut the book impatiently

  why should he be so strangely
haunted by janice why should he
imagine that there was something
different about her to-day as though
her beauty had intensified and at
the same time taken on a hint of
tragedy which it had not held be-
fore

   could it be possible that she cared
for sefton arlen

  it was strange how the thought

disturbed him yet she was noth-
ing to him

  nothing a dark flush stained
his cheek

  she was a girl whose life he had
taken and used for his own ends
and however much he might tell
himself that she had benefited by
the change in her circumstances his
sense of justice and his sense of
honor both told him that she de-
served more than he had given her

  suddenly he found himself re-
membering the strange attraction
which she had held for him-that 
kiss with which he had claimed his
bride at his fathers bedside that
night when he had paced beneath
her window and felt the strength of
his emotions like a magnet drawing
him to her

  it seemed years ago now all that
part of his life appeared to have
been cut away by the arrival of
gina mornington

  suppose gina mornington had not
come back would he have learned
to love the girl whom he had mar-
ried

  but he told himself impatiently
that love comes only once in a life-
time-real love-and that he had
given to gina mornington

  he rose impatiently and walking
across to the desk helped himself
to a cigarette from the box which
stood upon it but after one or two
puffs he flung it into the fire

  he crossed the room and sat down
on a couch near one of the long
french windows

  while he sat there staring discon-
tentedly into space he heard a girls
voice outside the door and turned
his head quickly as it opened ex-
pecting to see janice but the girl
who stood smiling at him from the
threshold was gina mornington

  youre not to get up she ex-

claimed as he would have risen and	and when the butler told me you

reaching his side pressed him back	were downstairs i insisted on com-

into his seat i was determined to	ing in and announcing myself she

come and find out how you were	seated herself beside him looking

 janice closed her eyes
 and lay breathing
 quickly her hands
 pressed against her
 madly beating heart
 she could hear again
 the murmur of her hus-
 bands voice could feel
 the pressure of his
 arms the throb of his
 kisses
midnight madness



 anxiously into his face i was so
 terribly worried i felt that i sim-
 ply had to come and see how you
 were to-day my dear

   im all right he told her a
 touch of restraint in his voice

   she made no reply

   suddenly as their eyes met he
 bent toward her

   gina he said his hand closing

 over her wrist last night-

 where were you

   what do you mean she asked
 and something she could not define
 stopped her from saying more as
 she gazed into his troubled face

 -	he released her passing one hand
 over his eyes

   last night i had a strange
 dream he told her i was alone
 in my room and had fallen asleep
 by the fire suddenly i woke up
 and you were there bending over
 me you and i were there-alone
 i could have sworn when i woke up
 this morning that it was true

   as she listened her heart began
 to beat quickly with excitement
 she was fond of pretending to be
 of the helpless clinging type the
 type which she believed appealed
 most to men but in reality she had
 a brain which was as keen as a
 mans she could grasp a thing in
 an instant now she saw what a
 chance his uncertainty gave her of
  getting the hold over him for which
 she had longed

   the color flooded her face and
 then receded leaving her deathly
 pale with excitement

   for a moment longer her eyes
 held his then the heavily lashed
 lids fluttered down veiling them
 from his sight

  she spoke hardly above her
 breath and yet every word she ut-
 tered fell clearly on the stillness

  roger she murmured her
 voice making a passionate caress of

his name my dear suppose it
was no dream but a reality 

  what areyou saying he asked
hoarsely how could you have
been here

  dont you know the old proverb
-that love laughs at locksmiths
she asked i knew you were
alone she slipped to her knees
beside him my dearest dont you
understand iknew you were alone
-something stronger than myself
forced me to run the risk to come
to you you wont blame me be-
cause my love for you was so strong
even though our love must always
remain a secret i do not care to
know that i belong to you is the
greatest joy in the world and noth-
ing can take that from me 

  kneeling beside him she reached
up her arms and putting them
about his neck drew his face down
to hers

  mechanically his arm went about
her shoulders but he was aware of
no quickening pulse beat no thrill
from the nearness of this girl the
very thought of whom had once had
the power to set him ablaze

  he had a strange feeling of numb-
ness as though he had received a
stunning blow and he looked
blankly at the lovely alluring face
so close to his

  then his brain cleared as though
a great shaft of light had pierced it

  at that moment he knew that
whatever he had felt in the past for
this girl he did not and never had
really loved her

  the glamour of her spell was dead

  he did not know where the
knowledge came from he dared not
ask he only knew that his discov-
ery had come too late

  janice turned in at the lodge
gates and saw a car a few yards
ahead on its way to the house


street  smiths love story magazine

  to her annoyance she recognized
it assefton arlens

  reaching the curve in the drive
she would have turned off in the
direction of the garage hoping to
miss the visitor when he stopped
his car and getting out hailed her
she was obliged to stop

  ive just come to pick up gina
mornington he told her i prom-
ised that i would pick her up and
drive her back as im lunching at
the chelmsfords where
she is staying	

  janice felt suddenly
cold but under the
coldness her hatred for
the other girl smoldered
fiercely

  do you know her
well she managed to
say

  yes she and i met
two or three years ago
when i was abroad he
answered and as they
turned and walked to-
ward the house to-
gether he gave her a
sharp look

  in spite of her effort
to hide it some of her
hatred for the other girl
had crept into her voice

  your husband and gina are old
friends i believe he observed cas-
ually

  janices hands clenched but she
managed to keep her voice quite
steady as she replied

  yes i believe they are

  rounding the corner of the house
they reached the steps which led
up to the terrace and longing to
end the interview janice began to
mount them saying that they
would go in that way

  if roger is still in the library
he can let us in she added

 a few more steps brought her

to the first of the library windows
the curtains were drawn back and
any one standing outside could see
straight into the room it was im-
possible for them not to see those
two within-the girl kneeling with
her arms around the mans neck-
and it was at that precise moment
that roger greville placed his own
arm around gina morningtons
shoulders

  for a moment janice stood as
though turned to stone
then forgetful of the
fact that she was not
alone she turned and
walked blindly away

  reaching the para-
pet she gripped it and
stood gazing downinto
the gardens below see-
ing nothing but a red
mist and in the center
of it those two - her
husband and the girl he
loved

  suddenly sefton ar-
len spoke beside her

  surely janice you
are not going to endure
that sort of thing

  her need to speak to
ease some of the pain in
her overcharged heart 
was so great that she forgot the
identity of her companion

  they were engaged to be mar-
ried she said dully

  his eyes flashed understandingly

  i know he nodded and they
quarreled that was how you
caught him on the rebound youre
curiously like her every one has
noticed that my dear girl-his
hand closed on hers-dont you
know that she is not the sort to let
go her grip on any man who has
once cared for her she is dan-
gerously fascinating surely youre
not going to allow yourself to be
midnight madness



made a laughingstock if they
wart each other let them see that
they are welcome you must real-
ize that you wont suffer you have
a career at your finger tips

  what do you mean she asked
ive watched you at every re-
hearsal and last night you simply
amazed me youre a born actress
if youd like to leave roger greville
ill find you a decent job without
the slightest difficulty why not let
me help you

   you are very good but at pres-
ent i have no intention of going
away i think we had better go in
now-the other way

  he laid a hand on her arm de-
taining her

  promise me one thing he
 begged if ever you do want help
promise that you will look on me
as your friend and let me help you
there was such a ring of sincerity
in his voice that janice forgot all
she had heard about him and felt
a thrill of gratitude

  after all it was good to think
that somebody really cared

  yes ill remember she prom-
ised and thank you

   as arlen followed her his heart
was beating with a new hope

  were the fates going to be good
to him would they help him to
win this girl whom he wanted more
than he had ever wanted anything
in the world

   janice paced the floor of her bed
room like some caged thing

  the silence of the house mocked
her with memories it was not
twenty-four hours since she had
stolen through the silence to arms
which had only taken her because
they believed they held another
girl

  too late now she saw what the
consequences of that stolen hour

would be-that by her own act she
had forged an unbreakable tie be-
tween the man she loved and gina
mornington

  she could not think clearly her
knowledge of the love between those
two threw her mind into chaos

  at first she kad meant to tell her
husband what she had seen through
the library window but she had
found that she dared not do it lest
she should betray her own love for
him

  for she felt that she would rather
die than have him guess that she
cared 

  but she dared not stay here she
could not

  suddenly she made up her mind
she would go away now leave the
house this very night and he should
not know where she had gone

  let him explain her absence as
best he could let him suffer some
of the humiliation that was hers

  she told herself that she hated
him and wished with all her heart
that it was true

  she had been waiting for the moon
to rise for she would have to walk
to the junction four miles away in
order to catch the early-morning
train to town

  as she moved across the room to
the window and drew aside the cur-
tain she saw that the moon was just
coming up over the tops of a clump
of fir trees

  turning back into the room she
looked around at the luxury she was
leaving

  the brief note of farewell she had
written to the man she had mar-
ried lay on the dressing table the
one suitcase which she was taking
with her stood ready packed near
the bed

  she picked up her heavy coat and
put it on opening the door she
paused to switch off the light and
	street  smiths love story magazine

it was impossible for them not to see those two within for a moment
janicestood as though turned to stone then forgetful of the fact that
she was not alone she turned and walked blindly away

picking up her suitcase made her self out of a side door and shutting
way out into the darkened corridor it silently behind her sped away
five minutes later she let her- into the shadows
midmight madness



  once she paused and looked back
at the great gray pile of the old
house-the place where she had
learned that love and suffering so
often mean the same thing to a girl

roger greville went to bed that
night and then there was no sleep
for him

  hour after hour he lay staring
wide-eyed into the darkness

  there was no hope in her heart as
she turned and walked blindly out
of the life of the man she loved
with a love whose bitterness was
akin to hatred

 it had been very late before

  he was like a man who fears a
 locked door inside which he is
afraid to look

  his infatuation for gina morn-
ington was dead he felt that he
hated her


street  smiths love siory magazine

  he had married janice against his
will he had no love to offer her
but he would never have deliberately
broken the vows he made toher

  he believed that he had neither
given nor claimed anything from
her but he had never meant to
hurt her

  dawn was long past when he fell
into an uneasy sleep and it seemed
as though he had slept only a few
moments when he was awakened by
a hurried knocking on his door and
in answer to his sleepy call a maid
came in	

  oh sir she cried ive just
been to madams room her bed
hasnt been slept in and i found
this

  she held out an envelope as she
spoke -

  with a queer feeling at his heart
he ripped open the envelope a
moment later he was staring down
at the slip of paper in his hand

  j am going away janice had
written you will realize that the
best thing for us both is to endour
marriage

  as he read those lines and knew
that she was gone he knew that he
loved the girl whom he had mar-
ried

  a groan of anguish broke from
him had he learned the truth too
late

chapter viii

      

  janice sat on the edge of the nar-
row bed in the room which she had
engaged in a quiet hotel in the east
fifties

  it was all unspeakably drab-the
walls with their faded paper the
dressing table on which the scarf
was not quite clean the dingy net
curtains at the window only half
veiling the dull sky beyond

  how different it all was from the
surroundings which had been hers
in roger grevilles home 

  she had determined to try to get
work on the stage remembering
what sefton arlen had said to her
but she was equally determined not
to seek his help for she felt that he
was the sort of man whose friend-
ship meant danger to any girl

  besides she wanted to be inde-y
pendent

  one of the girls who used to work
with her had been on the stage and
from her janice had heard about
theatrical agents through whom it
was possible to obtain stage work

  as soon as she had breakfasted
she purchased a weekly theatrical
paper searching the columns of the
paper for what she wanted

  she found the names and ad-
dresses of several agents and se-
lected one which was not far away

 but when she reached the open
doorway inside which a narrow stair-
case led upward to the agents office
her courage almost deserted her

  climbing the stairs she entered
the waiting room and her heart
sank again as she saw the number
of people who were already there

  she sat down nervously aware
that every one was staring at her
and there followed the most uncom-
fortable ten minutes she had ever
known in her life

  if she had had the courage to do
so she would have got up and gone
out and she was just trying to sum-
mon it to her aid when an inner
door opened and a small dark man
came out he was accompanied by
a taller gray-haired man and the
two of them walked to the door ten
gether and as they parted the
former- turned and caught sight of
janice

 he paused and stared at her

  tell me he demanded where
midnight madness



do you come from and why havent
i seen you before

  somehow there was something
about him which she instinctively
liked and it gave her courage

  can i see mr whitehouse she
asked

  yes he answered good-na-
turedly unless those lovely eyes of
yours are quite blind

  from his words she gathered that
this was the agent arnold white-
house himself

  five minutes later she was sitting
opposite him in his private office ex-
plaining to him her desire to obtain
work on the stage

  he listened until she had finished
i suppose you realize he told
her that you haye got a tre-
mendous nerve you come here
having had no professional experi-
ence whatever and demand a job in
the most overcrowded of all the pro-
fessions and the most difficult to
break into what makes you think
that you can act

  she hesitated

  because i was told so by a man
who really knows she finally con-
fessed he offered to help-me but
i dont want him to do so

  the agent raised his brows he
could understand that quite a lot
of men would be willing to help
such a lovely girl it was her beauty
which had made him noticeher just
now and he-was used to lovely girls

  he drew a big ledger toward him
and picking up a pen asked a few
brief businesslike questions noting
down the answers

  then he rose and held out his
hand

  well frankly miss-er- he

began i forgot to ask your name
 janice hesitated then she remem-
bered that her mothers maiden
name was darling and gave him
that with her own christian name

   janice darling he repeated as
 he wrote it down well miss dar-
 ling i dont hold out much hope
 of being able to do anything for you
 but if you care to stop in the
 office every day ill keep you in
 mind if anything turns up

   with that she had to be content
 but though for the next ten days
 she visited the office every day she
 never received anything but the
 same greeting one which she heard
 given to dozens of other girls ab-
 solutely nothing to-day my dear

   she also tried other agents with
 the same disappointing results until
 she began to lose heart -

   her visit to the agents took up
 only a small part of the day and
 there was all the rest in which to
 think and worst of all the long
 hours of the night for she slept
 badly and when she did sleep it
 was to dream of roger greville

   try as she would to forget she
 could not put him out of her mind 
 she knew that the time would
 come when she would have to com-
  municate with him for if their mar-
 riage was  to be dissolved he would
 have to know where she was but
 she didnt want to let him know
 until she got work and could prove
 to him that she was independent

  one day driven by an uncon-
 trollable impulse she climbed on
 top of a fifth avenue bus and from
 her seat she looked down again at
 the spot where she had first encoun-
 tered roger greville

   the bus stopped in front of the
 jewelers shop and as she gazed
 down it seemed to janice as though
 she was once again the plainly
 dressed girl who had found herself
 suddenly looking into a mans eyes

   she knew now the meaning of the
 surge of emotion which had quick-
 ened all her pulses


street  smiths love story magazine

  that day she went to arnold
whitehouses office in the afternoon

  as she entered the waiting room
the office door was flung wide open
and he came out and beckoned to
his secretary who was talking to a
golden-haired girl as he turned
back he caught sight of janice and
paused to speak to her

  nothing to-day he told her
and then added in a lower voice
but if youll be in promptly at
eleven to-morrow morning ir may
be able to fix you up i dont prom-
ise but there is just a chance

  she thanked him and as he went
back into his office and she left the
waiting room there was new hope
in her heart 

  she got halfway down the stairs
toward the street when she heard
footsteps descending behind her
and a-voice called to her she
turned to find the agents secretary
close to her holding out an envelope

  mr whitehouse said that if you
would go to this address at once
with this letter there is a chance
you might get something  right
away

  before janice could reply the
secretary had turned and was gone

  janice glanced down at the en-
velope in her hand the flap was
sealed down and it was addressed
to mr paige rendell star thea-
ter and marked urgent

  less than a quarter of an hour
later janice found herself entering
the stage door of thestar theater
and in reply to the inquiry of tlie
doorkeeper she showed him the
letter

 he sent a boy who was in the
office with it bidding him take
that to mr rendell	 

  in a short time the boy came
back asking janice to follow him

  she never forgot the interview
which followed and when she left

the theater she could hardly believe
that she had actually been hired by
one of the most- famous producers
in new york to play a part in the
play which was then in rehearsal 
the girl who had been originally
engaged for the part had been taken
ill that morning and it was difficult
to find a girl to fill her place janice
happened to be the exact type
needed for the part which though
it was not a large one was very im-
portant		-
when she confessed to having had
no real experience the producer
 merely nodded

   that doesnt matter i am sure
 that you will be all right he told
 her

  janice had never known what
 real nervousness meant until she
 stood on the deserted stage at the
 star at eleven oclock the next
 morning

   she had never believed that any
 ordeal could be so terrible and it
 was only sheer will power which
 stopped her from failing

  several times paige rendell
stopped her making her go over the
piece again and each time as she
caught the exact intonation he di-
rected lie gave a nod of approval
he saw at once that she was a born
actress and needed very little teach-
ing

   at lunch time the rehearsal was
 dismissed until the afternoon and
 janice was just walking off the stage
 after the others when the producer
 called her back

 	just  a minute miss darling
 he said a gentleman here is very
 anxious to make your acquaintance
 or rather renew it-for i understand
 that you havemet before

   an immaculately dressed figure
 had just strolled out of the shadows
 and janice felt her heart miss a beat

janice was just walking off the stage when the producer called her back
a gentleman here is very anxious to make your acquaintance or rather
renew it-for i understand that you have met before he said

for the man who stood holding out	it is more than good to meet

his hand and smiling down at her	again taking her hand and re-

was sefton arlen	taining it sefton arlen glanced at

street  smiths love story magazine

the producer well my dear ren-
dell wasnt i right when i guaran-
teed that ja-that miss darling was
a born actress

  the other man nodded
withdrawing her hand janice
gave sefton arlen a swift startled
look

-	what do you mean you-

she began

  i happened to be in arnold -
whitehouses office yesterday and
i caught sight of you and sent a
letter of introduction to our friend
paige rendell

  so it had been through sefton
arlen after all that she had ob-
tained an engagement

  the knowledge brought with it
deep disappointment which janicie
found it difficult to hide

  if he guessed what was in her
mind sefton arlen gave no sign

  ever since he knew that she had
left her husband he had searched
for her and had almost despaired
of finding her but now he felt that
his luck had turned

  lets go and have some lunch
he said there are a good many
things i want to talk to you about

  	janice hesitated but it seemed
that it would be too ungracious to
refuse and so less than a quarter
of an hour later she found herself
sitting opposite him in a well-known
restaurant near the theater

  looking across at her sefton ar-
len felt his pulses quicken it
seemed to him that janice had
changed in some indescribable way
the vividness of her beauty had
somehow deepened there were
dark-violet shadows beneath her
eyes and a hint of tragedy about
her face in repose

  she had been worrying he
thought and a sharp stab of jeal-
ousy shot through him

  he was amazed to find that he

 was capable of jealousy and he
 could it oti i riders ian d the strange in-
 fluence which this girl seemed to
 have established over his life

   love to him had never been
 more than a pastime he was used
 to easy conquests and enjoyed flit-
 ting like a bee from flower to flower
 but he had known vaguely from his
 first meeting with janice that the
 attraction she held for him was
 something different

   now tell me he demanded
 where have you been hiding your-
 self and why you knew that i
 could help you why -were you so
 independent

   she flushed

   i didnt want to bother you she
 said  

   well let it go at that i think
 -in case i hear something less flat-
 tering but what sort of engage-
 ment did you contemplate obtain-
 ing the only sort of work white-
 house could have gotten for you was
 a place in the chorus where the fact
 that you are so very ornamental
 would have offset your lack of ex-
 perience thank heaven that ive
 found you and that you were wise
 -enough to leave home when you
 did

   she made no reply and he was
 content to steer the conversation 
 away from her private affairs 

   he could be a very charming and
 amusing companion and for the
 first time in many days janice found
 herself laughing and forgetting a lit-
 tle of her heartache

   this meeting with sefton arlen
 made her realize more than ever how
 intensely lonely she had been and
 she could not help being a little glad
 that her loneliness was at an end
 after all it was good to feel that
 some one took an interest in what
 happened to her 

  have you made up your mind
midnight madness



what you intend to do he asked
as the lunch was drawing to an end
if you are to make a career for
yourself it would be much better
for you to be free youre in touch
with greville i suppose

  she shook her head

  no i-i wanted to wait un-
til--

  you could prove that you were
independent he finished for her
well youre safenow if anything
should happen to this play-which
however i believe will be a success
-i can always manage-to see that
you have work

  she gave him a level look

  why should you interest your-
self so much in me it is very good

of you but-

  i believe in you he broke in
shortly if you really want to
work i believe there is a big career
in front of you i cant think why
you never turned your thoughts to
the stage before look here--he
bent a little nearer to her-you
must be sensible put roger gre-
ville out of your mind altogether
he isnt worth a second thought
you have some pride havent you
should i be here if i hadnt
she asked wearily -

  youd have been mad if youd
stayed to play second fiddle to gina
mornington he retorted with
brutal frankness you knew that
they were engaged before he mar-
ried you anyhow whether you
free him or not she doesnt care
she has him and she means to keep
him

  janices hand resting on her knee
beneath the table clenched but she
lifted her head with a reckless ges-
ture

  youve seen her recently she
asked

  a few days ago he hesitated
theyre in town going about

everywhere together youll have
to do something about it janice

  yes she repeated dully ill
have to do something about it

  meanwhile though-he glanced
at his watch-we had better be
getting back to the theater until
after the opening i want you to
think as much of your part and as
little about other things as you pos-
sibly can you must make good
janice i want you to and i want
from you what i have never cared
to ask from any girl before-i want
your friendship

  surely you deserve that she
told him

  as he followed her out of the
restaurant sefton arlen was more
puzzled about himself than he had
ever been

  he talked of friendship but he
knew that he wanted a great deal
more than that he wanted to win
her and make her his own

  if he failed he knew that noth-
ing in life would ever be worth hav-
ing again

  for the first time he was afraid
of failure

  when roger greville realized that
janice was gone he explained to the
servants that his wife had been
called away suddenly by the illness
of a relative and within a few hours
he himself had packed up and de-
parted

  he had absolutely no idea of
where janice could have gone he
felt that she might have returned
to new york and it was with the
vague hope of finding her that he
went there himself

  somehow he shrank from tracing
her by the help of any of the de-
tective agencies whose aid he might
have called in

  it was his belief that he had for-
feited his right to claim her to drag
	street  smiths love story magazine

janice had made a success of her part in the play the day after the
opening a photograph of janice darling smiled up at roger greville
from the front page of the paper he had found his wife

 her back into his life if she wished	she too had come to new york

 to be free that held him back	and had taken a suite at one of the

 away without a word to her	when he told janice that her hus-

band and gina mornington were
being seen everywhere together

  as much as it was possible to do
so roger greville avoided gina
mornington and when she re-
proached him for doing so told
her that he had a lot of business to
transact

  she accepted the explanation with
a very bad grace but she did not
suspect that-he had changed toward
her she believed she had won him
back by a lucky chance-a chance
which she believed to have been
born out of an illusion of his delirium
-she had bound him to her and
she had gotten rid of janice

  of one-thing she was determined
that other girl should never come
back into his life though the pres-
ent arrangement didnt suit her
at all

  roger greville refused to discuss
his wife with her and gina did not
know if he was aware of janices
whereabouts or not but she wanted

the thing put on a definite footing

  when the time came for the pro-
duction of exiled hearts at the
star theater janice faced her or-
deal bravely she was determined
to succeed she had so much at
stake

  although the part she was play-
ing was not a big one it was very
important and she made the suc-
cess of the play

  the critics were unanimous in ac-
claiming janice darling a find

  she had beauty talent and what
was more important that elusive
thing known as personality and in
her one big scene she brought the
house down

  she was a success

  the next day there were photo-
graphs of her in all the papers and
when roger greville sat down to his
breakfast a photograph of janice
darhng smiled up at him from the
front page

  he had found his wife

enchanted garden

 walk in a garden enchanted
 whenever i think of you-

 a garden of rainbow splendor
 prismatic in color and hue

 and somehow each flower resembles
 the beauty of your sweet face
 and somehow the trees and bushes
 portray your bewitching grace

 diana and sappho and psyche
 are sculptured in marble there

 companioned by beautiful venus

 with whom they vie to compare

 but somehow your beauty surpasses
 the statues of grecian art

 because it is tender and human

 and echoes the pulse of my heart

wednesday night well
probably go somewhere and
dance afterward its not a
party merrilee-just a couple of
girls i used to know at school and
their dates bring your own man

i know you have plenty to choose
from

   merrilee dodd caught her breath
it was lucky nola was busy taking
things out of her trunks and pack-
ing them away in the maple chiffo-
nier so that she didnt notice the
effect of her words

   merrilee tried to think of some
escape from the situation but
borrowed man



 couldnt shed been afraid of it
 from the moment she received
 nolas letter saying she was coming
 to new york for a two-months
 pleasure stay and when nola an-
 nounced she was taking an apart-
 ment in the same building as mer-
 rilees the thing had become cer-
 tain

    well it was her own fault merri-
 lee realized that she shouldnt
 have written those letters to nola
 and her other friends back in mill-
 ingham giving such a gilded picture
 of the good times she was having
 i go out three or four nights a
 week with the most wonderful men
 she had written

   nola tucking away a stack of
 lingerie-what clothes the girl had
 -was saying now im anxious to
 meet some

merrilee choked out a reply she
hardly knew what she was almost
on the verge of confessing the truth
but great grief how would it
 sound

   those letters about the good
 times shed have to say werent
 true i havent been going out at
 all plenty of men have asked me
 but they arent the sort of men i
 like so-

   oh gosh that would just sound
 like sour grapes and think what
 nolawouldwrite to the folks back
 in millingham nola was a good
 friend all right but not such a good
 friend that she wouldnt take a gos-
 sipy delight in writing

   what do you think the wonderful
 times merrilee has been telling about are
 all just dreams she never sees a soul she
 claims she doesnt like the men whove
 asked her out to hear her tell it there
 are hundreds but she couldnt get even
 one for a little party i was having its a
 pity too because shes such a sweet girl

   merrilee could almost see that
 letter she could hear the shocked

but eager exclamations of sympathy
back in millingham sympathy
she gritted her teeth at the idea

  i-i think id better be getting
down to my apartment she stam-
mered its about bedtime

  why its only ten oclock mer-
rilee

  i know but i-i was out so
late last night

  in her single room which seemed
unusually cramped after the luxury
of nolas suite she tried to think of
a way out of her embarrassment it
was almost as bad as those days
back in millingham before she
started earning her own money
when she never had the right
clothes finally she went to bed
the unsolved problem haunting her

  at the office next morning when-
ever an ebb in the work permitted
personal thought it was still a
taunt of course she might get
henry powell who had asked her
for dates three or four times but
she never had felt like going any-
where with him and she shuddered
at the notion of presenting him in
his trick clothes and trick manners
to nola and her friends as one of 
the wonderful men she had met
in new york

  tapping a list of purchase orders
awaiting her check-up she staged a
mental review of the other men who
might be available there was mr
harbor old enough to be her great- 
uncle murray phillips so boring
that he could make five minutes
seem an hour max burton jimmie
keel- no they were all impos-
sible it was hard to believe that
one girl could attract such a gallery
of ineligibles of course she hadnt
had much opportunity to meet new
york men except here in the office
and it just happened that none
were very desirable-except harvey

 tate and he had never asked her
 for a date

   wasnt that irony for you the
 one man who could have qualified
 wasnt interested he was inside
 talking with mr london now and
 on his way out hed probably stop
 as usual and ask her to be sure to
 put through the papers on the pur-
 chases from his company then
 hed chat for a couple of minutes
 in a way that would show he could
 be fascinating for hours and that
 would be all 

   he was coming out ndw strolling
 toward her

   theyre getting another order of
 those tumblers he said and-

  i know and you want me to
put it through right away all
right

   he laughed there was a quiet
 heartiness about his laughter har-
 monizing with the strength and re-
 straint of his face which seemed
 more tanned than ever in contrast
 with the white flash of his teeth
 merrilee had a faint sense of life
 speeding up in her veins as he
 paused at her desk

 -	you read my thoughts so well
 he observed im almost afraid to
 think in your presence

  his conversation in the fleeting
 minutes while it lasted was always

-	just personal enough to give the illu-
 sion of being only a part of a larger
 friendship it made merrilee feel al-
 most as if she really knew him

   i jvonder if youd do me a- favor
 -- she stopped herself what
 on earth was she saying on an in-
 stants crazy impulse she had almost
 asked him to help her

   gladly what is it he urged

  she hesitated almost panic-
 stricken she had to say something
 or hed think her silly the wild
 -impulse of a moment before seized
 her again

  its a strange thing to ask i
need an escort she heard herself
saying she could feel the hot blush
on her face i want to play a sort
of joke on a friend of mine youre
just the type of man she likes she
declared  with inspiration that
amazed herself the other men
ive been dating here in new york
arent as likely to make her jealous
for a moment he did not reply
standing with a puzzled grin the
color deepening under his tan now
it was he ho was embarrassed it
helped merrilee recapture her poise
also she was relieved and pleased
at what she had said about dating
other men and making her friend
jealous the idea had come to her
out of nowhere

 im sure youll like nola wil-
liams too she continued suavely
shes really beautiful-tall and
blond she was about to add
and very wealthy but decided
that- it would have the wrong effect
its wednesday night will you
help me she asked

  isnt it a pretty difficult assign-
ment-he grinned uncertainly-
trying to make some girl jealous
i think youre capable oh and
of course she added with sudden
positiveness ill pay my own share
of the expenses it will be strictly
business at least that part of it
will fifty-fifty

  his gray eyes surveyed her with
a smile she could not quite interpret

  all right he laughed but its
your own idea

  merrilee dressed and made up
more carefully than she had since
the first month she had been in new
york her dress was of deep-green
that seemed to britig out her color
the flush of her cheeks the deep-
brown of her eyes fhe somewhat
lighter soft brown of her hair she
had arranged the hair to curve

xnent nola in shimmering blue when they went to the dance at


street  smiths love story magazine

the cloudline club harvey guided
her about the glazed floor in lithe
strong rhythm so suavely attuned
to the music that his steps might
have been written by the composer
as a part of the score

 he danced with nola and the
others always returning to lead
merrilee off for another number
she was deliciously aware of the
pressure of his arm around her the
steel of his shoulder beneath her
touch the nearness of his bronzed
face brushing lightly against her
hair

  she let herself think for a mo-
ment how wonderful it is-just to
be with this man then with a
wrench of will power she dragged
her thoughts to reality these
thrills were borrowed harvey tate
had only lent himself to her as a
favor

  when they finally went home
harvey and slie in some way became
separated from nola and her escort
taking a taxicab to themselves

  merrilee sat back with her eyelids
half lowered aware of harveys
smiling nearness yet feeling dread-
fully like cinderella at the approach
of midnight when borrowed happi-
ness would be snatched away she
was suddenly rebellious at that
thought

 i wish harvey was saying
whimsically that doing favors for
people-were always as pleasant as
this has been

  i hope youll be able to help me
out once more her words came
on a sudden impulse but the tone
was-casual i promised nola id
go with her on the eighteenth will
you take me you know just to
round out the impression with
quick strategy which surprised her
she added to-night worked out so
beautifully having you as a date

made just the right impression on
her

  why all right consented har-
vey with that odd smile which she
could not interpret

   at her first opportunity she spoke
to nola

  what are you doing the eight-
eenth

 why nothing oh yes thats
a wednesday i have a date with
dick mills

   at first she didnt think a double
date could be arranged

  i have a kind of -tentative en-
gagement with harvey said merri-
lee

  nolas face lighted quickly-too
quickly

  maybe we can fix it she said
ill call dick

  next day she reported its all
right were just going to the
danube you come too

  the danube was a colorful but
serene place where the orchestra
skillfully alternated  gay sweet
strauss waltzes with the best of the
latest tunes

  again merrilee was in harveys
arms dancing and again life
seemed to be moving faster through
her veins because of his nearness

 there was a thrill of being touched
by his hand in being held close
against him as they danced

   merrilee found herself wishing his
arms were around her in a real em-
brace wishing she were crushed
close against him to be kissed even
the thought made her heart pound

  she was in love with him it
seemed odd that she should just be
realizing it all at once this way
she must have been in love with
him for days maybe for weeks

   she looked up at his face close to
hers did he care too his eyes
met hers and her nerves tingled
borrowed man



with an embarrassed but delightful
warmth his arm tightened about
her

   surely he cared-a little anyway
-maybe more than a little well
she would know on the way home
to-night perhaps

   as they returned to their table
merrilee felt a surge of gratitude to
nola if it hadnt been for her she
might never really have known
harvey she almost wanted to
throw her arms around nolas neck
and thank her instead she smiled
at her and exclaimed nola
youre simply gorgeous in thatdress
isnt she beautiful

  harvey and dick mills agreed

   when the four finally trooped out
of the danube all took the same
cab it was the natural thing to
do merrilee realized though she
hadnt counted on it harvey was
between nola and her and dick
faced them from one of the folding
seats

  nola and harvey had become en-
gaged in some sort of banter prob-
ably over something they had dis-
cussed while dancing together oc-
casionally it included the other two
then something nola would address
directly to harvey would claim his
whole attention

   a sudden displeasure shot through
merrilee it was akin to jealousy
she resisted it telling herself it was
-stupid but as nola continued to
usurp harveys attention shej
burned with resentment

  in the foyer of their apartment
building dick and harvey said
good night with brief handshakes

  nola called after harvey laugh-
ingly dont forget next tuesday

   all right he replied striding
out

  a thousand needles pricked mer-
rilee her heart seemed to leap to

her throat and fall back with a
thud

  in the elevator nola confided
smiling

  were going to have dinner at
yesterdays tavern

  nice of him to ask you merri-
lee replied

 she hadnt meant to speak
sharply but something in her voice
caused nola to explain

  it was a sort of mutual invita-
tion i told him id heard of it but
had never been there and he said
hed take me why do you mind
i mean do you like him

  merrilee couldnt reply no words
would fit

  oh of course you like him
nola supplied with innocence in
her blue eyes and real sincerity in
her voice but i know you dont
like him too much you can spare
him you still have plenty of oth-
ers he says so himself

  yes merrilefe-choked

  the elevator had stopped at her
floor and the operator was waiting
for her to leave she stepped out
almost stumbling and hurried to the
shelter of her apartment

  all the loneliness of her months
in new york suddenly crushed in
upon her happiness had come so
close-and passed her by she had
had harvey tates companionship
just long enough to realize she loved
him and then nola who always
had everything she wanted got him
too

  she couldnt blame nola though
she had handed him to her she
had virtually told them both to go
ahead and care for each other

  what a mess she had made of her
own happiness she  thought dis-
mally

  the next evening nola stopped
at her door for a minute

  i was talking with harvey on


street  smiths love story magazine

 the phone she said if you have
 a date tuesday why dont you

-	come along with us

   oh no nola but thanks
 sorry merrilee said nola
 we just thought you might be hav-
 ing a date anyway and--

   oh nolas remark meant in-
 nocently enough had bruised her
 already wounded pride did- they
 think she couldnt get another ate
 well she could shed show them
 both well i do have she said
 as if reconsidering ill ask him if
 he wants to go to the tavern
 when nola had gone merrilee
 sat with hands clenched until her
 knuckles showed white trying to
 think of a suitable man 

   jimmie keel wasnt really so bad
 he just hadnt interested her
 shed told him she was awfully
 busy and hed said hed be glad to
 see her when she had time

   at the office next day when
 jimmie strolled in she smiled
 after a minutes conversation she
 ventured a remark that she wasnt
 quite so busy lately and-just like
 that-it was all arranged

   jimmie wasnt quite tall enough
 but he was really nice-looking and
 fairly interesting merrilee realized
 that she might have found him all
 right for an occasional evening be-
 fore if she hadnt unconsciously
 compared him with harvey tate

  that was what hadvhappened
 she had met harvey on her third

	day at the office and since then no
 other man had seemed attractive
 the truth stabbed cruelly it hurt-
 more because she -was aware of it
 too late 		

   tuesday evening was misery the
 four of them made a congenial
 group but nola exercised a sort of
 possessive claim on harveys atten-
 tion it was so subtle and withal so
 natural that it could be felt rather

 than seen but it tore at the hurt
 in merrilees heart sometimes for
 an instant merrilee met harveys
 gaze deep in the gray of his eyes
 was that look she never could quite
 read it made her pulse throb
 faster

   arriving home at last was a re-
 lief

  good night said jimmie
lets do this again soon

   fine responded merrilee

  but she knew she wouldnt it
 wasnt fair even to jimmie to use
 him this way and for herself it
 was only misery

   it was a relief that nola didnt
 ask her to come along when she
 went out with harvey the next week
 -a relief and torture she wasnt
 needed now they preferred to be
 alone

   merrilee sat in her apartment and
 tried to close her mind to the bitter-
 ness of her thoughts she tried to
 forget those few bright hours when
 she had been with harvey re-
 membering them only hurt she
 jumped to her feet and paced the
 floor as if in a desperate futile ef-
 fort to vent her emotions in some
 sort of action if only she could do
 something	

   harvey came to the office to ar-
 range the details of an order his
 firm had received he paused bet
 side her desk leaning his bronzed
 hand against its edge smiling as he
 chatted

   merrilee felt a cheated yearning
 then a sudden rebellion against fate
 another of those curious unpre-
 meditated notions flashed through
  her mind in an instant she was
 acting on it concealing her impetu-
 piisness with amazing tact 

   i was just thinking about you
 harvey she began carelessly
 another friend of mine from out
 of town is coming to-morrow and
borrowed man



i wondered if you wouldnt help me
again-just as a lark it worked
out so well the first time you know
for everybody concerned

  for a moment harvey didnt
speak he gazed at her in uncer-
tain silence as if trying to figure
what she meant by that

  of - course she added in a quick
matter-of-fact way ill pay my 
share of the expenses just as be-
fore

  all right said harvey with a
slow rather puzzled smile i
know itll be pleasant

  and by the way merrilee told
him this girl isnt from milling-
ham shes from central city
she and nola  dont know each
other so you dont need to worry
about that

  when he had gone merrilee sat
almost trembling no he didnt
need to worry  but she did she
had spun her web of pretense so
thin drawn it out so far starting
with a simple little fib about having
a good time in new york she had
stretched it until the most impor-
tant part of her life seemed to be
built on make-believe she was in
near-panic but she couldnt turn
back now

  at noon she had lunch with helen
brodie

  helen im in an awful jam she
confessed

  lets hear said helen her dark
eyes sympathetic but twinkling i
havent forgotten what you did for
me when tom thought id been
two-timing him

  merrilee grinned in spite of her
own troubles her friendship with
helen was one of those whole-
hearted dependable ones that per-
sists even though circumstances
make actual meetings rare she told
her frankly what had happened-
what she had said to harvey tate

  i get it nodded helen im
the friend from central city

  yes but dont you go falling for
harvey too im warning you con-
fidentially hes good-looking but
he has a brother in prison he killed
his first wife hes an habitual drunk-
ard and he cheats newsboys
sure helen agreed and if
you get him i hope youll reform
him tom and i will be seeing
you

  merrilee arranged the date for a
saturday night starting out with
harvey her heart beat with mo-
mentary triumph and uneasy excite-
ment her plan was daring wild

  this girl were going to meet
she said as they rode in the taxi
thinks were crazy about each
other she forced herself to laugh
merrily its a shame to disap-
point her too badly

  every girl said harvey sol-
emnly should be helped to keep
her illusions ill do my best
they met helen and tom at the
cloudline club

  isnt it wonderful up here
helen exclaimed i think new
york is grand oh merrilee is
mr tate the man youve been writ-
ing me so much about

  merrilee tried to blush and from
the hot feeling of her cheeks
thought she succeeded

  harvey had let his fingers touch
hers and hold them lingeringly at
their table he helped her to her seat
with great tenderness his eyes
hovered upon her hungrily and she
returned the gaze with a thumping
burning heart she had to be care-
ful lest he see at once how real it
was

  helen met her eyes and exchanged
a surreptitious glance which harvey
was intended to notice

  when they danced he held her
close-closer than he really had to

-and once when helen and tom	touch of a kiss had been meant in-

were near and he was sure they	stead of make-believe
could see he let his lips brush her lets go out here a minute he

forehead with a gentle kiss	suggested

it made her blood race with joy they were near an open doorway

and pain oh if only that fleeting	to the walled terrace harvey was

he seized her
in his arms
held her
crushed close
against him
kissed her
soft yielding

he whispered
borrowed man



playing his part well this was a
natural thing for two lovers to do

  with his arm about her waist he
led her out onto the terrace like a
balcony in the sky overlooking the
lamp-sprinkled darkness of the city
in the distance was the river and
the slowly moving lights of a boat
boxed evergreens behind them
screened them from the bright open
doorway to the dance floor

  a sudden painful bit of logic
flashed through merrilecs mind
out here there was no need for
harvey to act he couldnt be
seen so he had come out for a
respite

  but harvey apparently didnt re-
alize his opportunity instead of
taking his arm from her waist he
tightened it until they faced each
other he put his other arm around
her suddenly held her close to him
and pressed his lips against hers in
a long deep kiss it was so deep
so burning that for a moment it
felt real and it took all her will
power to hold her cool senses she
tried desperately to speak lightly

  thank you sir but you dont
have to do that helen cant see us
here you can relax

  he released her from his arms
his willingness to let her go when
there was no need to hold her some-
how scraped cruelly against her al-
ready raw taut nerves before she
realized it she had spoken again
bitterly

  besides nola mightnt like it

  the instant the words were ut-
tered she was sorry she hadnt
put any pleasant bantering into her
voicc this time instead she had
let it show that she was hurt now
harvey would despise her

  but the look which came imme-
diately to his face for some reason
wasnt a look of disdain it was a
look of astonishment then of par-

tial understanding something like
gladness hovered in his gray eyes

  ill have to confess about nola
he said slowly shes a very nice
girl but i only dated her because

- well look here merrilee

your time was occupied with lots of
other men i knew that from what
nola told me and from what you
said yourself i didnt want to pre-
sume an our fifty-fifty business re-
lationship you set the limits of it
pretty clearly but i thought if i
went out with nola now and then
youd be along and if i could only
be around you more i still- had a

vague hope that- he hesitated

  merrilee put her handon his arm
clasped it she looked up eagerly
into hisgray eyes and the gladness
that was hovering there seemed sud-
denly to have lit them for they
were glowing tenderly now

  you had a hope that what she
urged him

  he seized her in his arms held
her crushed close against him kissed
her soft yielding lips

	i hoped he whispered that
we could go on with our fifty-fifty
plan-with a slight change though
ill pay all the expenses you think
up the ideas for games and things
to pretend before your friends you
think up all that sort of thing after 
we do one thing that ive thought
up darling

  what is it dearest

  that we get married will you
oh harvey dearest i thought
that up long ago she murmured

  so did i-the first time i went-
out with you sweetheart

  he kissed her again  even if
they hadnt been on the lofty ter-
race above the citys roofs above
the river and its slowly moving
lights shed have felt that she was
just as high carried by her joyous
soaring heart

caught on but her heart was a
bottomless pit of anguish young
doctor wallace had kept his word

he hadnt come to her first public
appearance her triumph

  in floating rose-shaded chiffons
and filmy veils eve had drifted like
a wraith blown by a breeze out of
black tree shadows on the terrace to
an improvised stage of green velvet
turf her eyes searched vainly for
that tall lithe figure the moon
spread silvery whiteness over the

ls-f
orchid girl



many rows of intimates in paris
gowns and faultless evening clothes
over the masses of flower beds
shrubs and tinkling fountains

  in that silvery light on the soft
wings of music from a hidden or-
chestra eve danced like a spirit
from another world a deep hush
wild applause

  to music like a precious memory
eve in white her hair sculptured
gold danced a love call her love
call to bob wallace danced the
glory and miracle of womans love
for man danced until that blase
crowd rose and cheered

  but even when she stood sur-
rounded by a worshiping group of
friends even when a famous pro-
ducer offered her a thrilling connec-
tion with his broadway revue grief
sheathed her in ice success with-
out bobs love was salt on her lips

  well shed go to new york work
fiendishly succeed lovelessly

  then she saw him his back
against a stately elm outlined in
colored lights magnificent-looking
in his black-and-white  a fine-
shaped head broad-shouldered with
a gleaming smile that could melt a
heart of iron but eves heart
wasnt iron it was clay for him to
mold her heart was beating cra-
zily loud now in her ears as she met
his eyes with a silent appeal he
bowed moved toward her then
squared his shoulders and swung off
toward the house

  he cant do that to me eve
sobbed inwardly he must under-
stand he shouldnt hate me now
and avoid me like a plague im no
longer a rich spoiled girl he must
know im dancing to-night for my
bread and butter

  she ran swiftly away to escape
the gayly possessive friends and in
spite of a gust of self-contempt-

she eve hilton running after any
man-darted past the swimming
pool to overtake that hurrying
figure

  running fleetly she remembered
that other night when her world had
glistened goldenly at the house
party of her cousin lucile who had
been disinherited for eloping with an
artist ralph lane eve had met
doctor robert wallace when their
eyes hers warm honey-brown his
deep- direct blacky locked she had
been drawn to him as on an invisi-
ble cord twenty-eight vitally pow-
erful mouth resolute smelling pleas-
antly of soap and antiseptic eves
heart thumped with a savage ex-
citement she wondered what was
happening to her could it be love
at first sight that exploded her emo-
tions into small bright stars of hap-
piness like a bursting skyrocket

  lucile had forewarned her
hands off darling bob wallace

steep ascent and said in a voice that
was like a deep-toned carillon of
bells the views grand but
youll ruin your silver slippers and


street  smiths love story magazine

they must have cost you a whole
weeks salary

   so he thought her a working girl
like most of the others at the house
party

  laughing inwardly eve crushed
the impulse to confess that she was
the only child of john hilton in-
ventor and multimillionaire and
supposed to have been engaged in
her cradle to that wealthy playboy
cyril clarke

  ive seen you somewhere be-
fore bob mused did you sell
me some things in dentons base-
ment

  no eve answered demurely
but her eyes danced mischievously
perhaps i waited on you in the
five-and-ten

   on a rustic bench on the hilltop-
eve and bob talked he spoke
briefly of his hospital work shyly
of his ambitions she said her
mother had died when she was a
tot but her father was a grand pal
lately he hadnt seemed like him-
self weak heart she worried

   suddenly eve was startled by a
fierce new longing she ached to be
held close in bobs arms

   lets go back and dance bob
she suggested overcarelessly

   its stuffy inside all that gang
 besides i dont dance havent
 time work all day and sometimes
 all night

   she chattered to ease her wild
longing father says i danced be-
fore i walked he let me have the
best teachers paris petrograd
but he always hoots when i say
id dance for my supper if i ever

had to earn my own- she

 stopped furious at her slip

   he stared -at her -fora painful
moment his mouth rigid sorry
he muttered you must think me
an utter ass he lighted a ciga-
rette but didnt smoke instead

ground it fiercely under his heel
of course youre eve hilton deb
john hiltons daughter your pic-
tures forever in the rotogravure it
always  rested me the sunday i
didnt see your face pretty dumb
of me to mistake you for a work-
ing girl itll be a grand joke to
tell your friends five-and-ten
just let me tell you young lady
he went on savagely some of the
nicest girls ive ever met work in
the five-and-ten

  bob she pleaded i didnt

mean- please-

  shall we go back his imper-
sonal tone stung her

  she lashed out at him i hate
you but she knew it wasnt hate
but the magic fever of love pulsat-
ing through her veins he was so
attractive so straight so decent

  he eyed her coolly but his jaw
was a hard knot

   good it wont be hard to teach
myself to hate you too miss hil-
ton how you must be laughing up
your  sleeve at making a monkey
of me

  she wanted to cry out her love
and longing instead she stood up
her voice pointed icicles im go-
ing back to lucile

   he stood up too and brought his
stern young face close to hers
spoiled pampered child used to
getting your own way well youre
a stick of dynamite for a struggling
young doctor like me labeled
dangerous-keep away 

  the next instant she was swept
roughly into his arms and her
golden hair hardly reaching his
shoulders she felt herself lifted on
tiptoe hftkissed her lips until they
warmed under his he kissed her
again and again not tenderly but
fiercely until she hung limp in his
arms

  let me go she stormed and
orchid girl



had never known such gnawing
pangs of fury even while in that
electric moment her heart beat in
her throat like a trapped bird
every pulse in her body sang in the
ecstasy of love she tore herself
away and ran like the wind down
the slope up the-cottage steps-
into luciles arms

  i was just coming for you eve
darling ralphs getting the car
the phone-your father-

  father not-dead no no

  a month after that night eve
ivory-pale in her white mourning sat
huddled in the huge
book-lined library
with its soft tones
of old mahogany
furniture she had
just had two pain-
ful interviews one
with her fathers
laywer who told
gently that when
the creditors were
satisfied she would
be penniless the
other with cyril
clarke in which she
repeated her decision hot to marry
him until he forswore drink and his
playboy habits and settled down as
junior member of his fathers law
firm

  cyril stood balancing himself on
unsteady legs medium height too
heavy for the middle twenties - un-
easy mouth bloodshot eyes he
smoked one cigarette after the
other and regarded her sulkily

  thats crazy eve a smoothie
like you a professional dancer
youll starve to death  the first
month

  you know jacques said i ought
to make dancing my career eve
said quietly but her hands worked
nervously and old orloff in

petrograd said the same my first
engagements thursday night-the
graysons charity garden party

  the days that she must live
through before her debut as a pro-
fessional dancer crawled for eve in
spite of unending hours of practice

  sometimes she broke into fits of
wild weeping for her father once-
twice she longed unbearably to see
bob wallace beyond a formal note
of sympathy and a box of her fa-
vorite deep-purple violets he had
completely ignored her

  she wanted to see him so much
that one afternoon humbling her-
self she phoned his
office

 he was at the
carlton the suite
of the great vien-
nese nerve spe-
cialist doctor-

  eve didnt try to
catch the name she
would wait in the
carlton lobby she
must see bob  tell
him she was sorry
confess

	after an hour of
waiting she saw him step out of the
elevator

  hello bob

  eve miss hilton wish i could
stop but im late now at the hos-
pital he spoke pleasantly but so
distantly

  eve hurt to the quick would
have fled but she saw one hand
crush his soft gray hat that en-
couraged her he wasnt so stony
indifferent after all

  i phoned your office i wanted

to tell you- she forced her eyes

to his face a muscle twitched in
his cheek

  theres nothing to tell it was
just my fool mistake ive always
believed vour world and mine dont


street  smiths love story magazine

mix im glad i found out the truth

 so soon before- he was po-

 litely edging away from her 

   bob  she pleaded her heart
 emptied of hope he was so remote
 how could she reach him make
 him understand that out of a world
 -of mien her heart had chosen him
 for her man bob im dancirig
 to-morrow night at mrs gray-
 sons	   

yes for the childrens hospital

  i bought tickets blit i wont be
 there he moved  away a few
 steps then wheeled and said furi-
 ously please eve stay out of
 my life im a workingman
 youre an orchid girl besides im
  not the marrying sort

   eyes burning with angry unshed
 tears eve stood until he disap-
 peared through the revolving door

then her firm chin lifted some 
day doctor wallace when my
names in electric lights a foot high
hi send a gorgeous check to your
 hospital and youll be proud of me

  this promise gave her courage
 when she sped after bob into the
  graysoa house and glimpsed the
 doctor in the library shaking hands
 with old colonel grayson

   shed wait in the hall pocket her
 pride tell bob she now was poor
 as a church mouse

   a loud voice behind her de-
 manded whereve you been all my
 life darling and his eyes pin
 points his mouth working restlessly
 cyril clarke caught her to him

   she tried to draw away cy
 please	- --

 i want to talk to you eve
 come in here gripping her shoul-
 der he half dragged her across the
 hall

   eve struggled mentally if she
 went with cy shed miss bob and
 a chance for a magic moment to-
 gether and a word of explanation

 if she refused cy he was capable
 of making a rowdy scene he
 hadnt been drinking of that she
 was quite sure but he seemed dif-
 ferent excited restless  deter-
 mined better hear what he had
 to say

   all right cy eve said wearily
  following him into a near-by room
 vmake it snappy  mrs grayson
 may want me

   tell her to go chase herself he
 said rudely yqure- tny girl and
 fathers sore as the deuce about your
  dancing to-night hes sick in bed
 -pretty close to the end- im afraid
 he wants to see you right away
 he sent you this and says im to
 bring you to him

   he thrust into her hand a ring

 	with a magnificent pear-shaped
 ruby its deep-red fires outlined in
 the cold gleam of diamonds eve
 had seen the ring often on the hand
 of gys now-dead mother and knew
 it belonged to the world-famous
 clarke collection of rubies

   cyril snatched her sickeningly
 close and tried to kiss her

   with a wrench she was halfway
 acrossthe room but he caught her
 and tightened his hold thats no
 way for a girl to treat the man shes
 promised to marry anyhow lets
 get going to father he may riot
 live the night through and he wants
 to tell you about a promise he made
 your father

   eves eyes brimmed with tears
 her father never in all her life
 had she felt so desperately alone
 if only she could talk to her father
 tell him-it might ease her aching
 heart to talk about him to cys
 father who had been one of his
 closest friends

   just a second cy i want to
 speak to-a friend

   she stepped out into the hall
 ahead of cy bob hat in hand
orchid girl	

he moved away a tew steps then wheeled and said furiously please
eve stay out of my life im a workingman youre an orchid girl
besides im not the marrying sort

was still chatting with colonel ask him to give her a mere five min-
grayson near the front door if utes alone in the music room -
only bob would look at her shed but eyes averted he bowed


street  smiths love story magazine

gra vely as she let cy hurry her past
him out the front door and into his
glittering sports roadster as cys
car sped into the drive eve
glimpsed bob settlehimself behind
the wheel of his little flivver with
its top folded back and wished
achingly she were beside him in-
stead of at cys elbow

  eve sank deep into her sad mus-
ing and answered cys excited chat-
ter only with monosyllables she
rarely smoked but to-night in her
keyed-up state she accepted a ciga-
rette from cy and was glad she
was smoking when he begged for a
kiss

  they were racing over a long
narrow bridge when glancing about
nervously she asked cy havent
you  missed the turn in the road
this isnt the way to your home
he laughed excitedly and
squeezed her arm

  i thought youd be too sleepy
to notice angel were heading
across the county border i know
a j p wholl marry us to-night
eve swallowed her mouth felt
dry but she wondered at her com-
posure dont be silly cy i

cant marry you to-night bob-

  shut up he said roughly if
you want to live youll marry me
to-night or ill shoot this bus
straight into the nearest pole
youve fooled around with me long
enough ive decided to-nights the
night choose either a marriage
or a funeral	y

  eve was silent she realized it
wouldnt help to plead or coax with
cy in his present mood but she
felt numbly bewildered she had
known him since childhood good-
tempered easy-going the butt of
every sharper in town but never
rough masterful desperate like this

  wild thoughts shot through her
mind she could scream for help

but the road was frighteningly
lonely patches of black woods
open stretches of stubble not a car
had passed them

  she could pull the emergency
brake and leap out of the car but
likely enough this strange reckless
cy would jump out and drag her
back perhaps he had a gun and
might kill them both she had read
of desperate men committing just
such unthinkable crimes her
safest bet was to appear cool and
pleasant and not cross cy in any
way maybe she could escape
somehow at the j ps

  was that all make-believe about
your father cy she asked nicely
casual

  he chuckled sure dad starts
to-night in the yacht for elorida

  fury seethed within her so he
had trapped her through her love
for her father she had always
liked cy in a sisterly fashion felt
pity for the spoiled self-indulgent
only child of a self-absorbed father
now she hated cy wildly deftly
unnoticed she dropped the ruby
ring into his coat pocket

  aloud she said with a mirthless
laugh so youre kidnaping me
some headlines for the newspapers

  to herself she vowed savagely
ill never marry you cy clarke
to-night or any night id kill my-
self first	--

  cy laughed triumphantly that
wont bother us any well meet
father and the yacht in new york
and have months of honeymoon my
sweet

  he slowed the car down and with
the air of a conquering hero
reached over and swept her fiercely
close kissing her savagely insult-
ingly as she never had been kissed
before	

  outraged ashamed she pushed
orchid girl



him away and beat upon him with
her fists

 she panted dont touch me
again or ill jump out

  sorry eve he apologized peni-
tent ill behave just lost my
head thinking that in a few hours
now youll belong all to me for-
ever and keeps youre so beauti-
ful youve always had me eating
out of your hand

  they rode the next few miles in
tense silence eve relived that
snatched moment of bliss on the
moonlit bluff bobs kisses her
first kiss of real love then her lips
her heart her entire body had awak-
ened in the dizzying ecstasy of those
kisses now she scrubbed franti-
cally with her handkerchief to wipe
off cys shameful kisses until her
lips felt like a slash of burning red

  cy she begged please turn
back i cant marry you theres
some one else

  but cy wasnt listening his eyes
were riveted on the car reflector

 my heaven he gasped sud-
denly we are being followed -
chased i thought back there i
heard a car sures anything
theyre after me whatll i do
he moaned

  eve jerked upright in shuddering
terror whos after you what
do you mean

  then when he didnt answer but
continued to mutter incoherently
she shook his arm desperately try-
ing not to scream tell me cy
he mumbled the dennison
gang-baby-face morton i got in
wrong with him at a hand bookies
he said hed get me

  eve flashed a glance through the
rear window a car was tearing
around a turn in the road

  whatll they do cy to us
to me she demanded amazed at
her controlled voice

  kidnap us he babbled hold
us for ransom perhaps torture us
burn out our eyes as they did to
the redmond brothers kill us

  eve sat motionless she fought
panic-terror down she felt incased
in the ice of fear too numb to
move or think or speak she was
still so young life was sweet so
much ahead of her success per-
haps even love but death if she
couldnt have bob wouldnt be so
bad anyhow shed never ask
mercy of those gangsters shed die
game with her boots on as her dar-
ling good sport of a father often said

  a half sob burst from cys lips
theyre gaining on me egad
why didnt i pack my rod to-night
i could shoot it out the next in-
stant he burst into a string of oaths
so help me out of gas i told rob-
inson to fill the tank when i ran the
car into our garage this afternoon
hell get his if-- the car slith-
ered to a standstill

  the pursuing auto shot around
another turn in the road and slid to
a stop a few feet ahead of cys
roadster

 cy dropped his head on his
hands which still gripped the wheel
and sobbed hysterically oh eve
if only i hadnt dragged you into
this

  eve glanced at him contemptu-
ously he was yellow through and
through chicken-hearted though
terror froze her and her imagination
tortured her she said brace up
the worst hasnt happened yet

  tormented by horrid visions of
being bound and gagged she glued
her eyes to the door of that other
car in another breath now out
would leap a gang of masked ban-
dits with machine guns and she and
cy--

  to her gasped amazement only a
single figure emerged and ran fleetly
bob raced to eves side of the car ripped open the door and had her
fiercely tight in his arms before he exploded what do you mean
running off like this with my wife clarke

toward cys car but not before	bob hatless his face in the moon-

her eyes startled wide open with	light stern and grim as death he

surprise her thudding heart her	raced to eves side of the car ripped

hurrying pulses told her who it was	open the door and had her fiercely
orchid girl

v

tight in his arms before he exploded
what do you mean running off
like this with my wife clarke 

 cy gaped your wife i

didnt know- she only said

- then relief made him blub-
ber i thought-gangsters-kid-
napers-out of gas

  bob with eve close in his hard
but tender clasp hurried toward his
roadster over his shoulder he
flung back your cars safely off
the road sleep off your nerve jag
ill send you gas from the- first sta-
tion we pass

  bob laid eve gently back against
the seat cushions and covered her
with a robe before he slid under the
wheel

  all set he asked matter-ol-
factly but the concern in his man-
ner made happiness pour through
her veins like golden fire

  she sighed contentedly to have
bob save her like this was more
thrilling than the most exciting
movie rescue shed ever seen

  youre not to talk he ordered
with a quick assumption of his pro-
fessional manner ill do that for
both of us  close your eyes and
try to untie your nerves

  she tried to obey but it was-
too magically wonderful to be speed
ing under a deep-blue sky pricked
with yellow stars beside bob so
magically near that her hand could
and did touch the edge of his coat
she sighed again like a happy child
and nestled her head in the cushions

  a lilt of sheer joy warmed her
voice when she -broke the silence
how did you happen to come for
me bob

  he looked down at her wind-
blown golden head frowning
spoiledgirl must have your own
way i told you not to talk well
if you must know i didnt like the
looks of your boy friend when he

was hurrying you out to his car i
know something of playboy clarkes
habits he was all dooed up to-
night so when i saw him start off
at that breakneck speed i had to
r put an interne on an urgent case of
mine and waste some perfectly good
time on a wild-goose chase after
you his eyes twinkling down at
her softened the harshness of his
words and manner

   silence a wild elation thrilled
through her bob must care or he
wouldnt have taken the trouble to
save her from cy

   she leaned forward suddenly to
stare at him but bob she be-
gan her heart a singing bird you
told cy i was your wife

   he lighted a cigarette and in the
 flare she saw his mouth thin into
 a hard line dont let that upset
 you i had to give that poor sap
 a jolt or hed have tried to put up
 a fight for you but i told you
 before youd make havoc in the life
 s of a man whos devoting himself to
 service he took a furious puff at
 his cigarette inhaled deeply then
 said in the tone of a person trying
 to- convince himself i wouldnt
 want you for a wife if you were the
 last girl on earth not that im con-
 ceited  enough he added quickly
 to think youd- have me

   stranger things than that have
happened she said meekly and
wished this ride through the per-
fect summer night would last for-
ever

   neither spoke again until a few
yards ahead of them loomed up a
gas station

   itd do that fellow good to stay
there all night and sleep it off bob
muttered then gave the attendant
explicit directions about the location
of cys car

   bob said as if to himself sud-
denly a girl like you should al-


street  smiths love story magazine

ways wear orchids and ride in lim-
ousines he shot the car ahead in
a sudden burst of speed and lighted
another cigarette with unsteady fin-
gers eve noticed

  she laughed and the silver sound
of her laugh seemed to irritate bob
he glanced at her sharply you
find me quite a joke dont you
mistaking porcelain for crockery
with a shy sweet abandon she
caressed his hand on the wheel and
had the satisfaction of seeing his
face quiver

  a very pleasant joke bob and
we need jokes and fun to help us
in this tough old world dont we
she askedin her most serious little-
girl manner

  well you dont need to draw a
diagram - of me making a fool of
myself again over you he said
haltingly as if he didnt believe his
own words ill do nicely without
you in  my life expertly he
avoided a deep rut in the road
youre a golden girl and id burn
my fingers if i touched you

  she drew her fingers swiftly pro-
vocatively across his lips there
did that burn you she demanded
then  sighed and asked in a low
shaken voice why do we have to
hurt each other every time were to-
gether

  bob lighted another cigarette in-
haled deeply then flung it into the
darkness his voice was hard
clipped ive put up a tough fight
with myself since-i met you that
night on the -bluff i thought you

and i- but now ive got all that

licked i have no time for girls
no time for anything but my work
he flashed her a glance and his
eyes told her something that his lips
denied something that made awild
surge of joy beat through her

  both sat very quiet his shoul-
ders brushing hers until the roadster

some trick you two played on me cried
clarke your wife eh well thats a
dirty lie shes my girl if i dont get
her you wont he swung about a small
automatic pointed at bob
orchid girl



swerved into her driveway step-	but for bobs outstretched arms he

ping from the car she suddenly	caught her and carried her soft

stumbled everything went black	yielding fragrant to the bronze-

before her she would have fallen	grilled door he made a move to
	street  smith s love story magazine

set her down but she dung to him but she was bob had smoked
like a frightened child	an unbroken chain of cigarettes be-

  please bob dont leave me i m
all alone and i feel so-funny
where are the servants
dismissed

  he placed her like something
fragile on a couch in the mellow-
lighted library and drew up a chair
beside her

  through the gray veil of his ciga-
rette smoke he said take it easy
eve this has been quite an eve-
ning for you he mused some
palace this

  i was born here it hurts to
leave it

  read that in the papers bunk
of course

  she felt his eyes probe hers when
she answered steadily nothing
left but no debts im on my own
a professional dancer from now on
she smiled bitterly

he staredaincredulous a so-
ciety girls whim a dancing career
earn my way with these she
thrust out small feet in silver slip-
pers

  grudgingly he said you have
bewitching feet eve

  she laughed a bit wearily my
face isnt so bad either when you
get used to it then added indif-
ferently ive had an offer to dance
in a broadway revue

  eve hilton in a broadway re-
vue he scoffed

  his mockery filled her with fury
how dared he laugh at her

  their glances crossed and his face
sharpened with pain his handsome
mouth set stubbornly told her that
which made her heart throb to an
ecstatic tempo

 she jumped up must phone
before my new yorker leaves for
the train excuse me wont be
long 

fore she trailed back white-faced

	eyes dark-ringed

  neither spoke for-a moment

  out of that quiet like a hoarse
horn out of a fog a voice from a
french window in the sun room be-
hind them startled them both to
their feet

  some trick you two played on
me one hand behind him the
other clutching the window frame
cyril clarke stood wavering his
eyes were glazed his mouth worked
convulsively he slurred his words

  your wife eh well thats a
dirty lie shes my girl if i dont
get her you wont

  he swung about a small auto-
matic pointed at bob

  there was a terrible panic- 
stricken moment then eve leaped
forward no no cy i love him

a second of hesitation then i
told you i couldnt marry you 
there was some one else-bob
hes my husband she flung her-
self between the two men

  with a jerk bob thrust eve
aside caught cys wavering arm
slipped the gun into his own pocket
and knocked the dope-filled youth
flat when moaning and cursing
cyril rose bob with a few swift
blows rushed him through the win-
dow and out into the clump of
bushes below	

   i hate to beat up a poor sap like
that hes ready for a sanitarium
yetit had to be done he remarked
evenly but his mouth was steel-
hard	- -

  with a sobbing breath eve crum-
pled into a chair her face in her
hands

  i was so afraid-hed kill you
she quavered

  bob laughed not with those
orchid girl



shaking hands i was afraid you
vould--

  the mantel clock filled the room
with its tickling

 eve bob said his hands
clenched as though words locked
behind his lips were being forced
from him i cant-i wont love
you youd be a most exciting ex-
travagance for an ambitious young
doctor but oh my darling-his
voice broke suddenly-i cant live
without you

  he swept her close to him and
his lips pressed hers satiny berry-
red yielding in the glorious magic
of that kiss she was thrilled with
an ecstasy that she thought be-
longed only to the gods

  her arms crept up around his
neck she kissed him and gave her
heart into his trust

  you wont always be a strug-
gling doctor dear she said softly
he bent his head and rained kisses
on her spun-gold hair on the cu-
pids hollow in her throat her hands
her mouth exquisite adorable fra-
grant as a rose leaf ill earn with
my dancing

  not when youre my wife be-
loved gently he pushed her to-

ward the door phone your new
york man its all off

  but bob- she pleaded

  he drew her into his arms and
kissed her until rapture infolded her
like a cloak i may never have
much money my love but i cant
let my wife dance for money

  for love then ill dance my
love for you free eve said be-
tween a laugh and a sob i phoned
him no already said  intended

  cy

  she shook her head

  you her eyes were adoring
him i read somewhere when
something you want is passing you
by run after it so i ran after you
with my love

  bob laughed joyously i did
some pretty tall running after you
to-night my darling

  she clung to him she was where
she had longed to be closely held
in his arms lips upon lips

  a small quivering sigh escaped
her as he released her for a mo-
ment then he crushed her to him
again and set his lips on hers in a
kiss that lifted her to dizzying 
heights of ecstasy
heartless flirt  

    

         i	 by ives tudor

reine havent you anything to
tell me carl trueman asked

	in a strained voice

  only that i had a grand week
in  town and bought scads of
clothes reine laughed impishly up
at him 

  why didnt you answer my let-
ters and telegrams

  heavens the black lashes flew
wide over dark eyes in genuine
astonishment it took every spare
minute i had to read less than half
of them she softened the blow
tt was dear of you to send them-
and the flowers

  you promised me  an answer
when you got back he continued
grimly

  you made that suggestion she
denied i didnt promise anything
see here reine his light-blue
eyes snapped displaying temper
how long do you intend keeping
this up youve the most notorious
reputation of flirt by now every
unattached male in crest cove is
mad about you and a few married
ones as well im mad about you
but im not the kind of a man to
be led around by the nose

  reine sighed dismally drawing
heartless flirt



down the corners of her lovely red
lips for the first time in weeks
she felt free to walk where she
pleased knowing that paul cartier
wouldnt leap out at her from the
oddest places shouting childish
threats to kill himself unless she
married him and now carl was
spoiling everything

  i hoped for a breathing spell now
that pere cartier has dragged his
neurotic offspring back to france
she sighed dropping her small head
its lovely wealth of hair as black
and sleek as the skin of a wet seal
i do wish youd stop being serious
carl im not in love with you or
with any one and i wont marry
you for your money

  his laugh was harsh enough to
draw her startled gaze

  you may change your mind
when the new prosecuting attorney
starts in he threatens to put your
stepdad in the bread line or behind
bars

  reine stopped and swung squarely
to face him her cheeks were scar-
let with anger small hands clenched
and thumped the air

  hes an idiot sam hollis isnt
crooked he helps put men into
public office because he believes in
them and not for personal gain
the prosecutor doesnt think so
he says--

  i know -what he says she inter-
rupted sharply ive listened to his
broadcasts his official investiga-
tions will prove him wrong

  hes after the machine that sam
helped-well the political machine
that it has taken years to build up
i hope they take the meddling fool
for a ride he finished viciously 

  ypure talking like a dime
thriller carl

  she began to hum a gay song
and started across the lawn to join
the laughing group on the terrace

   suddenly the song died on her
 lips the power to move seemed to
 desert her she was conscious of
 nothing but the tall broad-shoul-
 dered man with the slim hips and
 trim build of an athlete who stood
 talking to francine adair

  while she stared at him he
smiled his teeth showing dazzling 
white in contrast to the deep bronze
of his face

   life flowed back into her limbs
 she moved forward into the sun-
 patched shade of silver poplars
 looking dainty and lovely in the
 coral-colored chiffon frock a floppy
 white garden hat dangling from one
 hand

   who is that man she asked
 carl

   he followed her gaze and laughed
 as though at a secret joke

   that my sweet is bart anders

  the new prosecuting attorney

   her breath caught in her throat
 what is he doing here

   i wouldnt know he laughed
 derisively he came here the day
 after you left for town rented the
 miller- bungalow and joined the
 crowd his mother and mrs lam-
 son were schoolgirl friends

   does he know that sam lives in
 crest cove

   hes after information if thats
 what you mean good thing sam
 is staying in town with dad for a
 while

  amy lamson called out a gay
greeting

   reine darling so glad youre
 back she added you look just
 like a lovely little girl standing
 there

   as if she didnt know it fran-
 cine adair flung in tartly drawing
 a few scattered snickers

  francine had lost carl trueman
 to reine and resented it

   reine scarcely heard her she


street  smiths love story magazine

 was staring into the bluest eyes she
 had ever seen smudged with thick
 black lashes she felt the blood
 mounting to her face

  darling amy lamson con-
tinued i want you to meet our new
prosecuting attorney and the son of
my dearest friend bart come
here

   he was beside her now meeting
 her wide-eyed gaze something
 flamed between them-something so

 -	thrillingly beautiful that it quivered
 through her like a song his look was
 like wings beating in her heart
 brushing against her eyelids linger-
 ing on her lips  

  now bart mrs lamson
warned half seriously after the intro-
duction dont lose your heart to

 -	her shes a heartless little flirt

   be careful- bart francine ad-
 vised lowering white lids over crafty
 gray eyes shes the daughter of
 king graft hollis

  ffrancine mrs lamson rebuked
 sternly

   but francine ignored the rebuke

  paul cartier the diamond
barons son tried to commit suicide
over her she continued relentlessly

  thats not true carl defended
 the darn fool got drunk and fell
 out of the canoe a man intent on
 self-destruction doesnt yell bloody
 murder to be saved

   carl thinks the queen can do no
 wrong francine smirked slyly

   but the blue eyes watching reine
 had suddenly lost their wrath and
 become coldly impersonal terror
 crept through her-a strange devas-
 tating terror that was an icy flood
 in her veins a flaming torment in
 her brain her hands pressed over
 her heart in a protecting gesture but
 his frozen look pierced the barrier
 like stabbing knives

  so youre reine hollis he
 stated unsmiling

  sam is my stepfather she ex-
plained my name is rogers

  his shrug was slightly contemptu-
ous as though to say its all the
same breed

  some one tittered her dark eyes
lost their velvety softness and swept
the circle silencing mirth red lips
tightened angrily emphasizing the
determined chin cleft by a dimple
that found its mate in her left cheek

  sam is the best father a girl ever
had her voice quivered with
anger

  i admire loyalty in any one
bart replied politely

  their eyes clung and he took an
involuntary step forward francine
saw and hissed spitefully

  remember mrs lamsons warn-
ing shes a heartless flirt

  for the first time the -coined ex-
pression given reine shortly after
her return from europe a year be-
fore ceased to be amusing she had
gained the reputation of flirt be-
cause few men could resist the lure
of her vibrant dusky beauty and
because she had flung herself with
the innocent abandon of a happy
child into a round of pleasure with
each new interesting-male and tir-
ing of their insistence had sent them
away bewildered and decidedly dis-
appointed she had been termed
heartless	

 francine bobbed forward and
clutched barts arm with working
fingers her foxlike face was flushed
a mottled red eyes gleamed mali-
ciously through narrowed slits

  be careful of her bart

  carls derisive laughter broke the
tension		

  you sound like a black witch
on a black black night fran

  she is a flirt you cant deny
it 

 tch-tch carl admonished

ls-f
heartless flirt



your nasty little brain is a gooey
mess of jealousy my pet

  heines smile was tremulous her
dark eyes wide and serious

  im not as bad as fran paints
me mr anders

  he smiled thinly not being
curious ill probably never know

  reine flushed and moved stiffly
away to join the small group near
the lily pond carl followed

  darling-pamela voight smiled
sympathetically-youll never dan-
gle barts scalp at
your belt

  and its such a
nice dark one dodo
wilson sighed dole-
fully shaking her
blond head

  les whitney grunted
angrily running nerv-
ous fingers through his
thatch of  straw-col-
ored hair

  you blondes talk
as though reine were
an aborigine head-
hunter

 les had been in love
with reine since their
romper - days his devotion was
laughed at even by himself only
his kind brown eyes carried a hint
of pain when he looked at her

  reines dark head lifted in a chal-
lenge

  ive never lost a man yet

   it was sheer bravado that re-
mark she could have added in all
truth that until now she had never
intended any man to fall in love
with her they just did spoiling
everything

  dont break a perfect record by
tackling the iron man carl advised
sagely

  a warm glow filled her heart

  you mean hes not interested in
any firl

 ls-f

  hes a confirmed woman-hater
said carl

  nope les  denied quickly
hes only shy of girls with daring
reputations a flirtatious lady
ruined his brother daves political
future some years ago she forgot
to tell dave that she was married
her husband raised a fuss sued
dave and all that it drove him
out of politics he died in a plane
crash last year

  thats why bart went into poli-
tics dodo added her
bit cheerfully he
swore hed get the
men who framed
dave he blamed

no other than-

  -	shut up dodo
pamela nudged her
tiny companion

  blamed sam you
mean reine finished
cleverly that is
silly a dangerous
gleam blazed in her
dark eyes ill make
him eat out of my
hand before i am
through 

  be careful carl warned those
quiet fellows have dispositions like
indians

  not jealous by any chance
carl she teased

  sure i am youre going to
marry me my sweet i always get
what i want

  so do i she snapped pertly
walking away

  reine had made a habit of taking
her early-morning swim long before
the rest of crest cove stirred from
bed she loved the fresh dewy
sweetness of the morning the in-
vigorating cold of the jake water
rippling into pure gold where the sun
touched it but most of all she


street  smiths love story magazine

loved the solitude the feeling of be-
longing wholly to herself

  she stood for  a moment on the
bank a scarlet patch of color against
the rose-gold of the morning then
she plunged in and swam for the
raft climbing over the edge just as
a dark head bobbed up on the op-
posite side bart anders grinned at
her

  good morning he greeted her
easily

  she drew a long breath and
laughed you startled me i never
expected any one else to be swim-
ming at this hour

  he drew his bronzed body garbed
in black trunks up beside her they
sat rocking in rhythm to the rafts
movements staring at each other
withthe frankness of children
arent you up early

  she shook her red-capped head
i always swim at this time i love
it its so still and beautiful i
feel as though im the only person
in the world

  i know its a grand feeling
isnt it	

  he stood up quickly etched 
against the background of brilliant
morning sky and dark water head 
flung high he looked like a young
god great muscles rippled easily
and gracefully beneath his bronzed
skin    

  he stared down at her and her
heart cried out against the barrier
between them he would never
trust her because of sam and be-
cause some one had been cruel and
jealous enough to brand her a flirt
she shivered but not from cold

  hadnt you better take your
swim and go in he asked matter-
of-factly 	 

  she jumped to her feet with
quick graceful  movements she
reached the springboard leaped
high in the air and dived

   she swam back laughing with the
sheer joy of living her next at-
tempt was a perfect swan dive he
applauded heartily as she climbed
back on the float and rested on her
back arms tucked beneath her head

   you can dive he complimented
i had hoped to win the crest cove
championship this year now i
shant even compete for it

  youre being nice mr anders
i didnt think you could be

   she was sorry the moment she had
said it the friendly laughter left
his eyes which became gleaming
disks of blue ice his strong mouth
stretched to a hard straight line

  we cant gain anything by use-
less discussion-curtly you are
privileged to live your life i live
mine

  but youre wrong about sam
mr anders-wrong about me too
only i dont suppose thats impor-
tant	-

   she hated the lie it was impor-
tant what he thought about her--
the only important thing in the
world

   youre either very clever or very
 stupid miss rogers he flung in

 	with spirit

  she bridled sam hasnt earned
the things youve said about him
she shielded her betraying eyes with
one hand neither have i 

  im not aware of having dis-
cussed you with any one

   no but youve listened to silly
 gossip its the same thing

  you call a brokenhearted boys
attempt at suicide silly gossip
reine raised herself on an elbow
one slender hand reached-out the
fingers closing over his strong brown
wrist  there was appeal in her eyes
and voice and the quaver of tears
 ill tell you the truth she prom-
ised i met paul cartier in france
just before setting sail for home he
heartless flirt



followed me here i never pretended	heard him cry out he swore he

to care for him-for any man - one	tried to kill himself because of me

night paul got drunk at a party and	it was his way of striking back
took a canoe out on the lake it very convincing
overturned he couldnt swim for- she straightened all the lovely

tunately a couple in another canoe	color draining from her face




street  smiths love story magazine

  you dont believe me
frankly no there have been
and are too many men in love with
you for you not to have earned the
reputation of heartless flirt men
need encouragement before making
fools of themselves

  how can you be so cruel

  she couldnt keep the quiver of
heartbreak out of her voice tears
glittered on her lashes small hands
pressed against her throat to ease
the pain there she loved him she
knew that now his look filled with
curious amusement was like the
prick of thorns in her flesh he
 haunted her consciousness like a
ghost making her want the feel of
his strong arms about her the pres-
ence of his lips on her own

  oh youre cruel she repeated
hardly conscious that she had moved
nearer that her bare white shoulder
brushed against the bronzed flesh
of his arm

  his smile was crooked  im im-
mune to your charms miss rogers
tell sam hollis that tell him
hell never trick me as he tricked
dave -

  the words reacted on reine like
a physical blow she cringed star-
ing at him with tear-dimmed eyes
he couldnt have said that horrible
thing but he had

  then fury swept her stinging
through her pain like the lash of a
whip driving her to hurt him as she
was hurt

v you dare accuse me of such
despicable cheapness she choked
did it ever occur to you that dave
anders wasnt framed that when
he was caught with another mans
wife in his arms he lied to save him-
self 

  the blow struck home he winced
as from the touch of scorching irons
pain twisted his face into a white

tortured mask filling reine with-a
gloating savage joy

  he looked at her she clenched
-white lids over stricken dark eyes
to blot out the misery she saw mir-
rored in those blue depths she
wanted to take back that awful ac-
cusation to beg his forgiveness
most of all she wanted to put her
young arms around him to steady
his shaking lips with her own

  you wouldnt have said that if
youd known dave

  you gave me no benefit of the
doubt

im sorry lets call quits
that meant he didnt want to see
her again she clenched white lips
to strangle back a cry her next
words came out involuntarily

  of course if youre afraid-

  he interrupted sharply afraid
of what

  of me but thats silly only
men withred blood in their veins
need be afraid of women

  they stood up and for a long
moment gaze met gaze he reached
out and caught her wrist pulling
her close to him their young
bodies touched and flames coursed
through her own leaping to life in
her eyes

  with an abrupt gesture he moved
away to the edge of the raft she
whirled and made for the other side
hitting the water in a clean dive
she swam still under water until
her lungs threatened to burst and
bright-colored spots danced before
her eyes she never wanted to
come up if only she could go on
like this forever losing herself in
the cool green depths of the water
becoming a part of it

  but the instinct of youth and
health sent her gasping to the sur-
face-and found  her almost in the
circle of barts arms he gripped
her shoulder towed her shoreward
heartless flirt



until his feet rested on the bottom

  dear heaven he breathed in
quick relief when you didnt
come up i thought-well all kinds
of horrible things

  the tone of his voice made her
heart sing arid her quick laughter
rippled upward on a note of exulta-
tion

  you adorable thing

  his strong arms swept her close
his lips crushed her own in a kiss
that lasted through thrilling eterni-
ties and rocked the world about her
she clung to him afraid to believe
that this beautiful thing had hap-
pened to them but it had there
was reality in his arms straining her
close and in the hot pressure of his
lips on her own

 the day was far too long for
reine bart was closeted with his
campaign manager and she
wouldnt see him until later at
pamela voights party she had
promised to go with carl and re-
luctantly kept the promise

  the dance was in full swing by
the time carl and reine arrived
mrs voight had hired an expen-
sive orchestra for the occasion
they paused on the porch

  um lovely reine enthused
tossing slim arms high slender body
swaying gracefully before carl

  in the beam of moonlight edged
by the deep shadows of a vine-
covered porch she looked like a slim
young goddess the gown of white
satin with silver threads through the
weave swirling about her silver-
slippered feet

  carl watched her red head thrust
forward eager eyes engulfing her

 youre beautiful he breathed
hoarsely

  she stopped before him sweet face
lifted only the image of bart alive
in her heart

  am i carl am i truly beauti-
ful   

  it was a wistful cry she wasnt
thinking of the effect of her loveli-
ness on carl she only wanted his
assurance that in barts eyes she
would be everything desirable

  carl reached out and swept her
into his arms crushing the lovely
gown carelessly his lips closing
down hard on her soft ones

  stunned by surprise she went
limp for a moment and in that
moment some one close by in the
shadows struck a match and held it
to a cigarette in the flare reine
caught barts searching glance filled
with a hint of mockery the next
instant the light faded out and he
 was gone

  she fought like a wild thing in
carls embrace one small hand
lashed out in a short arc and landed
against his cheek before he would
release her winged feet carried her
into the house frantic eyes
searched the room for bart and
couldnt find him

   an eager partner claimed her she
went from oneto the other in rapid
succession answering questions she
scarcely heard laughing when they
laughed and all the time her heart
was breaking her eyes were search-
ing despairingly

  the dance ended and carl hur-
ried up one cheek suspiciously red-
der than the other

  reine forgive me he begged
contritely you were so lovely-
so tempting

  she stared at him as though he
were a stranger what he said didnt
matter nothing mattered but
bart

  she swung about to leave him and
came face to face with bart fran-
cine clinging to his arm gowned
in scarlet satin her brown-haired
gray-eyed prettiness dimmed to


street  smiths love story magazine

nothing beside reines dusky loveli-
ness  	
we can row up to pirates rock
for a picnic francine was saying
i know the dearest spot bart and 
we-

  oh here you are reine said
deliberately dark eyes fastened on
barts white drawn face this is
our dance isnt it bart

  the music began a slow waltz
reine slipped into barts arms and
caught the malignant look francine
bestowed upon her out of earshot 
she whispered

  i had to talk to you bart i
--i was afraid you wouldnt ask me
to dance 

  i have good manners even
though my judgment is poor he re-
plied coldly notlooking at her

  they reached the open french
doors leading to the veranda

  lets go outside please she
coaxed when she read curt refusal
in his eyes

  there was a full pale moon riding
high in the star-studded sky its
image weaving and trembling jn the
smooth mirror of the lake that
stretched away from the foot of the
garden it sifted through the screen
of scarlet ramblers that trellised the
far end of- the porch she maneu-
vered bart to this spot where shad- 
ows gave it mystery and a hint of
romance

  he laughed bitterly you choose
an ideal setting miss rogers-
moonlight music and a beautiful
girl  

  she pressed back against the ram-
blers a blur of white against scar-
let one hand clutched the trellis
for support the other reached to-
ward him in childish appeal

  bart you must believe that carl
hadno right to-to kiss me

  he stiffened his voice quavered
with something deeper than anger

you
gave him
that right i
saw you tempt
him i heard what

said before-

youre horribly wrong
she broke in she swung close
to him a vibrant spark of loveliness
one hand caught his shoulder and
she raised her face to his

  ive never given any man but
you the right to kiss me bart 

  he caught her wrists and held her
away from him

  youll not trick me again he
lashed out francine warned me
youd try it  well im onto your
scheme-yours and sam holliss and
the man who hires him to do his
dirty work ill have them where i
want them in a few hours then
ill crush the whole filthy machine
and you with it
heartless flirt

carl reached out and swept reine into his arms stunned by surprise
she went limp for a moment and in that moment she caught barts
glance filled with a hint of mockery the next instant he was gone

  he was talking wildly but his ac-
cusations didnt make sense in her
consciousness all she knew was
that therewas hate in his eyes

  she brushed limp fingers across
her eyes suddenly her heart leaped
that wasnt hate she saw it was
pain hunger desire

  she swayed dizzily his arm stiff-
ened to give her support she re-
laxed against him and his arms
tightened about her crushing her
close against him the tumultuous
throb of their hearts caused them to
tremble

 he caressed the smooth dark


street  smiths love story magazine

 beauty of her hair with a shaking
 hand touched her cheek and the
 white loveliness of her bare shoulder
 reverently

   beautiful-beautiful he mur-
 mured his cheek resting against her
 tear-wet one reine--it was a
 far-away whisper of sound-youre
 not teasing me  this isnt a trick
 darling-darling oh bart kiss
 me i cant bear it if you dont
 the kiss caught her up lifted her
 into a world that held nothing but
 his arms his lips and his strong
 trembling body melting against her
 own	

   then a laughing chattering group
 barged onto the porch with a sud-
 denness that left bart and reine
 frozen in each others embrace

   here they axe dodo wilson
 shrieked to some one behind her

   francine adair thrust herself for-
 ward hands akimbo you cer-
 tainly did it reine she tossed
 back over her shoulder to the others
 she said shed make bart fall in
 ten minutes didnt she and she
 did it in eight you win reine

-well pay up

   there was a stunned silence the
 enormity of francines trickery left
 reine speechless icy fingers of fear
 trailed over her flesh icy fingers beat
 against her lips to liberate frozen
 speech the moon stars and earth
 whirled crazily about her and-
 through it beating against her ear-
 drums rose wild laughter-fran-
 cines

   -barts look washed over her like
 a baptism of fire he whirled and
 disappeared into the night with his
 going life flowed back into her
 limbs lent wings to her feet she
 raced  after him moaning sobbing
 his name over and over until it be-
 came a litany of terror and heart-
 break

  she caught up with him frantic
hands clung to him nor could he
shake them off

  bart youve got to listen fran-
cine lied she lied bart

  he strode on almost carrying her
weight as she clung to him it was
only when she stumbled and fell that
he stopped he lifted her easily
holding her at arms length 

  arent you satisfied with what
youve done to me he gritted
through clenched teeth

  she struggled to get near to him
suddenly he caught her close his
kisses werent tender now they
burned and bruised her soft lips
sending waves of fear through her
she beat tiny fists against his shoul-
ders fighting to be free 

  he shoved her away fumbling in
his pocket

  you made me pay in humilia-
tion for the kisses you gave me now
ill pay for the ones i stole

 he thrust something into her
hand and walked quickly away
dumbly she stared at the thing in
her  hand it was a new- one-
hundred-dollar bill bart had paid
for those kisses paid her as though

she were-

  she screamed it lanced the air
like the eerie wail of some dying
thing the next instant she crum-
pled to the grass in a small pa-
thetic heap beating the ground with
bruised fists sobbing brokenly

  les found her he picked her up
held her tenderly close while she
gasped out in anguish after the
fierce paroxysm had passed he sug-
gested sensibly

  come back now dear and act as
though nothing had happened

  i cant-i cant

  you must the others under-
stand and francine has gone pa-
mela saw to that the moment she
heard ill tell bart-
heartless flirt



    no she beat his arm shaking
   her head the lovely hair tumbling
  about her face promise me you
  wont tell him i hate him oh
  les i wish you didnt love me
  then i-i could marry you and
  wed-

      poor comfort in that thought for
  either of us dear he said unstead-
  ily while his mouth stretched in a
  grimace of pain

    they reached the porch she
  shivered and drew back at the sound
  of music and laughter from within

    let me be alone for just a min-
  ute she pleaded

     like a small hurt ghost she crept
  to the corner of the porch near the
  ramblers the place where-could
  it be only moments ago-bart had
  held her in his arms

   reine

    she jerked rigid and whirled
  from the shadows a dark figure
  emerged it was carl 

    listen reine-his voice was
  clipped strained-youre in a spot
  some of the girls are spreading a
  disgusting story saying youve gone
  pretty far with bart to save sam
  to save his pride bart will bolster
  it

    it was insane reasoning- but
   reine wasnt capable of judging
  that now she was conscious only
  that the money bart had thrust
  upon her burned her hand that she
  must do something-anything-to
  prove to him that she had really in-
  tended to trick him she wanted to
  wound him now as he had wounded
  her

    if we got married to-night
  reine every one would think you
  didnt give a darn about him it
  would hurt him too dont you see
  that it would

    it was a tempting argument al-
  most before she knew it she had
  given consent and they were speed-

  ing along the highway in carls
  shiny roadster headed for the near- 
  est justice of the peace

  thoughts tumbled about in her
brain-strange queer thoughts that
made-no sense then like the first
low throb of a far-off drum realiza-
tion stirred through her she was
going to marry carl suddenly she
knew she couldnt go through with
-it

   carl stop the car she cried

   it came to a skidding stop at the
 side of the road he twisted about
 in his seat to face her lips curved
 in a mocking smile

  changed your mind

   i cant do it carl it wouldnt
 be fair to you 

  he leaned back with folded arms
 youll either consent to marry me
 reine or well spend the night here
 and what a reputation youll have
 by to-morrow

   you cant mean that

try me and see i told you i
wouldnt be led around by the nose
but i dont love you carl

   his look was bold sly and filled
 with something that made her flesh
 crawl

   maybe ill find i dont love you
 after a month or two then ill be
 reasonable about a divorce

   bart will kill you for this she
 moaned covering scarlet cheeks
 with cold hands

   she hadnt meant to say any such
thing carl accepted it as a good
joke and rocked with laughter her
own clashed against it harsh dis-
cordant what did it matter to
bart what carl did now or ever

   after to-night carl gurgled be-
 tween spells of laughter bart will
 play ball with the big boys or else
 hell--

   reine jerked very straight hands
 clenched in her lap quivering with
 an unknown dread intuition sent

cameras all around and a lovely
lady for his arms

  she remembered now barts ac-
cusation against an unknown man
he bad said sam worked for she
took another blind step

  then you know that your father
is the man sam works for carl

  he sobered instantly who men-
tioned my father

  oh carl dont look so sur-
prised she laughed another lie
she felt wouldnt matter i knew
it long ago

  why didnt you tell me you
knew

  she shrugged convincingly sam
didnt want me to

  he accepted the explanation and
changed the subject

  what about us dont go old-
fashioned on me darling

  well-giving him a provocative
sidelong glance-you drive to the
nearest justice and ill think it
over

  good girl he enthused reading
consent into her reply

  they reached medville carl
drew the car up before a tiny ivy-
covered cottage set far back from
the road in a grove of maple trees
the justice cadaverous and half
asleep sensing a large fee let them
in he smiled affably when reine
asked permission to comb her hair
and powder her nose before the cere-
mony

  she followed his sleepy-eyed
wrinkled old wife up the stairs once
inside the clean bedroom she
whirled and gripped the  older
womans arm

please can i get out of here with-
out the men seeing me im in ter-
rible trouble wont you help me
theres the back stairs the
woman managed to gasp

  reine pulled barts one-hundred-
dollar bill from her bosom and

thrust it into the gnarled old hand
three minutes later she was in carls
car driving like mad toward crest
cove 

 it was a badly frightened di-
sheveled reine who pounded onthe
door of barts bungalow the place
was dark the door locked and no
one answered her frantic summons

 a horrible thought left her weak
and shaken leaning against the door
for support maybe bart had re-
sisted his enemies maybe something
had happened to him

  bart-bart

  a quick thud of running feet up
the path whirled her about could
it be carl coming after her to force
her into marriage she caught a
glimpse of the figure in the moon-
light and stumbled toward it with a
glad cry

  barts arms were about her hold-
ing her close

  dear merciful heaven-his
breath jarred sobbingly through
white lips you gave us an awful
scare les and i have been hunt-
ing you for hours

  bart you havent been in the
house

  no i got nearly home then
turned and went back to pamelas
i had to beg your forgiveness for
the awful thing i had done les
told me francine had lied im so
ashamed my darling

  wild words tumbled from her lips
as she repeated carls story when
she had finished he said dont
vou know this may mean prison for
sam

  she clung to him crying youre
all that matters to me bart ill
swear i was here with you all night
sam wont let them hurt you then
he cant without hurting me

abrue perched the hat-
advance models for spring
only two ninety-eight-
atop her shining brown hair squeez-
ing in between two other bargain
hunters she peeped into the mirror

  the nice things the right hat can
do for a girl but dare she spend
the money she took off the hat

wwilhmb

and gazed at it covetously in the
bag she held between her slim body
and her elbow was less than five dol-
lars on saturday she would get
the ten dollars aunt bessie sent
each week but that would have to
go for room rent and food

perhaps she had been reckless to
buy this suit from marge but it did
street  smiths love story magazine

fit so well was just the right shade
of blue and marge had worn it only
a few times and where could you
get a suit for five dollars

  she could not wear the outmoded
black satin hat that had been aunt
bessies pride last winter and her
own abomination this with her new
suit and hope to get a job she
scowled at the atrocity lying there
with her newspaper turned to the
help wanted-female page

  her scowl changed to a look of
astonishment as a mans hand
reached between two shoppers and
grabbed up the hat as if it were a
prize actually there was delight
written all over the handsome face
mabrue saw over the womens
heads

  then he was in front of her
thrusting her own hat at her and
-saying crisply ill take this put
it in a bag and make it snappy
please from his bill fold he took
ten dollars and gave her that too

  marbue blinked then she
grinned he thought he was buy-
ing a new hat what luck now
she could buy the new one

  yes sir she said primly she
hurried away only to turn and come
back drawing him away from the
mob she confessed im not
working here the hat you want is
my old one- i was trying on this
blue one you see wondering if i
could afford it she gulped and 
held out his money tears stung
her eyes	

  and i exploded the young
man have  spent the morning
searching for just this lid for aunt
ellen to wear to a funeral sud-
denly he brightened say violet
eyes how about a swap he de-
manded

  mister youre an angel straight
from the pearly gates   

  youre the angel he returned
youll be an archangel if youll
meet me at the glove counter with
the hat and change ive got to
buy a veil and black gloves and
get all the way down to deal new
jersey

  ill be only too glad to help you
out mabrue answered promptly

  heck ive lost the list with her
glove size on it lemme look at
your hands young hoss- trader
yep about the same size

  six will do then how do you
know ill show up with the change
youre so all-fired honest you
couldnt even let me buy the old
hat without a scenario of the plot
lady norman norris trusts thee
on the way to the glove counter
mabrue went to the rest room to
freshen her complexion and change
hats she smiled at her reflection

 as she approached the glove
counter she thought how tall and
well-built and how very well dressed
norman norris was he smiled at
her as he would at his nearest and
dearest and spoke in a voice just
as intimate

  aunties veil and gloves he
said as he dropped the small bags
into the large one she gave him
here are the blue gloves you
wanted dear to the clerk he
said not many wives trust their
husbands to pick out their mittens
do they

	perhaps madame would like to
try them on smiled the girl

  once more this strange young
man was making mabrue blink her
winsome face grew rosy then she
laughed delightedly

  why not she said airily favor-
ing her husband with a mocking
smile did you get the rompers
for susie and union suits for
danny

  she perched on the stool and
violet eyes

iu

rested her elbow on the little cush-
ion while the clerk cased on the
exquisite blue glace gloves

  what size does aunt ellen
wear mabrue asked with a twin-
kle

  seven norman matched her
twinkle told you id lost the list
so how do i know about susies
rompers and dannys undies

  you lose everything my prob-
lem child sighed mabrue

  well who lost her wedding
ring flung back norman norris
i suppose to-day is as good as any
to buy you a new one

 no rings  are so frightfully
victorian mabrue drawled

  you were proud enough of
yours he murmured close to her
ear when i put it on your digit
last june-er-i mean several junes
ago considering we have susie and
danny on the lost list my pet
were shoes sheers and peach-col-
ored do-dads for you remember

  of all the zanies chuckled
mabrue

  hose for madame put in the
clerk signaling to a clerk at the op-
posite counter

  mabrue said hastily wed best
buy the childrens things first

  norman grinned wickedly socks
formamma first he decreed

  then ill cure you smarty ma-
brue told him low

  but when she bought six pairs of
the sheerest he only laughed

  black for auntie size ten he
ordered no cobwebs however

  the hosiery went into thev hat
bag ladies shoes he inquired

  i shall be pleased to escort you
there sir spoke up an elegant
young man im smithers of la-
-dies shoes been matching hose for
a customer he smiled ingratiat-
ingly at the handsome pair

 mabrue clutched normans
sleeve are they all in conspiracy-
with you to push me from one de-
partment to another seriously
mr norris the joke has gone far
enough already

  i said norman taking her arm
and following their guide havent
had so much fun since the mice
made a nest in auntys best wig

  i feel as if i were living in a
comic strip laughed mabrue

  i live by one my lamb i do
the lets be gay strip

  oh i adore that series cried
mabrue

 could you adore its papa
nice fellow sober reliable
amusing though slightly mad he
dotes on sleek brown hair with red
glints in it violet eyes with imps in
em devastating dimples and lus-
cious lips

  why theres my uncle mabrue
was away like a shot

  norman was after her like an-
other and more speedy shot when
she admitted it was a ruse to get
away he grew grave he asked so-
berly you want to get away
end this and it was off to such a
good start

  they returned to the guide and
norman explained thought we
saw uncle eben but it was two
other people lead on mr smith-
ers

we can save time if you dont
mind climbing a short stairway sir
we spent our honeymoon climb-
ing the alps norman assured him

  at the turn in the stairs he drew
mabrue to him i was so happy
over finding such a delightful play-
mate he chided why did you
scram

  because i cant let you see the
darns in my stockings mabrue
confessed close to tears this
foolery has been the only fun ive


street  smiths love story magazine

had since i came to the city it was
worse back home

  why you poor sweet bunny
his free arm went around her and
his concerned eyes looked into hers
dewy violets he breathed and
kissed her soft tremulous mouth
with infinite tenderness

  for a second mabrue clung to
him then freed-herself

you will play with norman
sweet vi eye he pleaded softly
but thed-darns she wailed

  i love em because you did em
with your own fair hands

  when mr smithers slipped off
mabrues scuffed brown oxford and
the darns were revealed in all their
neatness mabrue flushed rosily

  t while the salesman was seeking
the blue kid pumps and brown ox-
fords asked for norman said i
crave to see those enchanting ankles
in sheers

  how you do run on mr nor-
ris laughed mabrue her color
deepening

  does my running get me to the
goal i hope for he demanded 

  does it usually you must have
had plenty of experience

 i have but ive never been so
darn keen about a girl before he
told her with earnestness in his gay
voice and eyes

 mabrue had nothing to say to
that she wanted terribly to be-
lieve him but it was all so impos-
sible - -
after mr smithers had fitted her
she whispered to norman -just
the oxfords the blues are ador-
able but not practical

  well take both norman said
crisply now for lunch

  im in your debt too much al-
ready mabrue demurred

  im in yours you mean be-
cause of your hat aunt ellen will
probably leave me an extra million

  is there really an aunt ellen

  two hundred pounds of- her
nearly sixty a tartar but i love
her we live together in an old-
fashioned apartment in the murray
hill section but she spends a lot of
her time visiting old friends in the
hinterland shes been with a sick
friend in deal the friend died yes-
terday hence the shopping ive got
to drive down there to-day with the
stuff

  i thought you were buying the
hat for a joke or something its a
hand-me-down from my aunt
weve both cherished it but it does
need a new lining ill buy one
you wanted to see the sheers on
so ill go to the rest room and put
them and the new pumps on and
meet you at the restaurant on the
eighth he or order something light
for me

  is it emily post to lunch with
a lady whose name you do not
know

 mabrue milburn accepts mr
norriss kind invitation to lunch-

 jj

eon	-

  mabrue milburn isnt taking a
run-out powder is she

  when mabrue fairly dancing in
the new pumps entered the restau-
rant she saw normans sleek black
head at once she thrilled at the ob-
vious relief on his face

  we should have gone where there
was dancing he said seating her

  youve got to drive to deal
she reminded him

  worse luck-but i mustnt say
that when ive just had the luck to
meet you the most wonderful thing
that ever happened to me there
will be other days-heady spring -
days and glorious summer nights
too

  mabrues heart was beating with
a new wild beat her lovely face

ls-f
violet eyes



was radiant she fairly sparkled
she looked and felt another girl
from the one norman had mistaken
for a clerk

meeting you has been the nicest
thing in my life she said

i  

m upq

  eying the mixed grill being placed
before them she asked do you
call this light

  nope just sensible go to it
kid im starved myself

  presently mabrue was telling him
of her life in the up-state town of
aunt bessies kindness to her or-
phaned niece she let me come to
new york to look for a job she
went on and shes been sending me
money when she cant afford it
id about given up trying to find
work when marge-she rooms next

ive never been so darn keen about a girl before he told her with
earnestness in his voice and eyes mabrue wanted terribly to believe
him but it was all so impossible

ls-f


street  smiths love story magazine

to me-told me it was my clothes
she sold me this suit yesterday and
told me to buy a hat

  after luncheon they bought the
lining for the hat but the trimmer
wouldnt sew it in because the hat
hadnt been bought there

  there are needle and thread at
home normansaid tentatively

  then you can sew it in mabrue
told him with an impish grin

  and lose my amateur standing
letsgo buy the peach do-dads

  i veto further splurging dear ex-
husband

  whadda ya mean ex the
word is future husband

  when they climbed into normans
car they had the peach do-dads
during the short drive mabrue
was telling jierself that aunt bes-
sie to the contrary it was all right
to accept these things from a young
man for whom you had done an
inestimable favor it was all right
to go to his apartment when he was
as nice as norman to do him an-
other favor

  it was a walk-up brownstone
quietly elegant the vestibule
boasted brass letter boxes complete
with speaking tubes and push but-
tons the floors were black-and-
white marble the stair carpet tur-
key-red	

  id like to slide down the ban-
isters laughed mabrue

  a second later all their purchases
were on the stairs and she was fly-
ing downward on the shining rail
she hit the newel post hard

  saves me spanking you grinned
norman

  i do not intend to do anything
to warrant a spanking sir

  oh no normans straight
black-brows shot up comically

  the telephone was ringing as they
entered the apartment

  look around while i answer it
norman suggested

  mabrue wandered from the spa-
cious drawing-room with its massive
furniture rich silk hangings and
deep-piled carpet into a small room
she caught her breath at the sheer
beauty that met her eyes cabi-
nets filled with exquisite chinese
porcelains lined three of the walls

  when norman joined her she
said i didnt know there was any-
thing so exquisitely beautiful in all
the world

    exquisitely beautiful yes but
dashed valuable and by way of being
a nuisance the apartment is never
left alone nights because of this stuff
aunt ellen gathered it when she
lived in the orient that was the
old girl on the wire ive got to stay
in deal for the funeral norah our
cook is ill at her daughters belle
the day cleaner wont stay here
nights alone ill have to phone
some of my friends and see if i can
get any of them to stay

  ill sew the lining in-while you
do it offered mabrue you know
i could look at that lovely china
forever

  thats all its good for-to be
gazed at  too easily broken to be
used or even touched like friend-
ship when you ask a favor

  or hearts

  hearts dont break i ought to
know he said savagely but did
not explain he led her into a bed-
sitting room with ivory-colored
 walls and furniture gay chintzes
and rugs through the sunny win
dow mabrue saw with surprise a
small square lawn hedged in and
a little maple tree

  the only young room we boast-
norman commented aunt ellen
fixed it up for her grandniece faith
but the poor kid was so scared of


violet eyes



the old tartar she scrammed
heres the sewing box

   when he returned the hat looked
almost new and quite perky ma-
brue pulled it over her ears and
made a face why the gloom
she asked

  norman laughed i thought all
the ad putter-inners must be blind
but if you wore that lid no won-
der you didnt get a job

   oh i had this tissue paper in-
side to pad it

  good its sure to fit over
aunties wig the gloom is because
i cant get any one to stay here for
several days and nights just what
i expected as i said friendships
are easily broken when you ask a

favor i dont know what to do-

say mabrue could yoii stay

  i could but-well how do you
know im to be trusted

  ive proved that you are miss
hoss trader look theres a ra-
dio scads of books magazines and
even a new toothbrush he piulled
out a dresser drawer nighties and
everything for aunties guests or
you you can phone the stores for
food and charge it how about it
vi eye

  how long do you want me to
stay

  until monday-no forever he
caught her hands in his and drew
her to him mabrue you lovely
witch what have you done to me
i do want you here forever close to
my heart

   she felt his lips on her shining
hair his breath warm on her fore-
head straining back she searched
his eyes what she saw there sent
quivers of ecstasy from her heart
to her smiling lips

  are we dreaming this norman
she asked

   it was his kiss on her lips that
told her she was not dreaming

  that kiss fiercely tender passion-
ately demanding awakened her to
the full meaning of life

  i love you love you he was
saying as he rained kisses on her
face and soft white throat he lifted
her in his arms and carried her to
the armchair near the window i
hate to leave you sweetest he la-
mented i shall think of you sleep-
ing in that little bed and dreaming
of me each day look out this win-
dow and watch the tiny leaves of the
maple opening under the warm kiss
of the sun just as your dear heart
opened when i kissed your sweet
lips

  presently there was a good-by
kiss-a whole series of good-by
kisses-then mabrue was alone with
her rapture and her bewilderment
things just did not happen like this
in real life she would wake up and
find herself in that ugly room up-
town	

  she spent the greater part of her
time admiring the exquisite loveli-
ness of-the china behind glass where
no rude hand could break it be-
cause of that rare collection she was
here

  she recalled normans savagely
bitter denial that  hearts break
why had he said that he ought to
know-she wondered

  saturday afternoon she found out
the answer

  belle had cleaned the already im-
maculate place and had left with a
friendly smile to this new grand-
niece of miss ellens when the bell
rang thinking it was the superin-
tendent whom norman had in-
structed to call several times a day
to see if all were well mabrue
opened the door

  past her through the foyer and
into the drawing-room swept a tall
beautiful young woman in smart ex-
pensive clothes


street  smiths love story magazine

  the taxi driver is bringing up
my baggage she called out

  but who are you mabrue de-
manded rushing after her

  the intruder turned and stared
haughtily i am mrs norman
norris to  think of aunt ellen
actually getting a new maidf did

norah die or-- say youre not a

maid another grandniece or-one
of normans friends

 mabrue- fighting off recurring
faintness was unable to answer she
sank into a chair feeling as if the
whole world was rocking on its foun-
dations

  so my  last guess was tight
flared the other girl her face a mask
of fury the old dragon must be
away orv he wouldnt dare high
time i came back from florida you
little pirate ive a mind to tear your
eyes out and-- she checked her-
self  as the taxi man appeared with
her baggage this way please
she led him to normans room

  mabrue bolted for the kitchen
she held the ammonia bottle under
her nose gulped down cold water
oh it cant be true she wailed
aloud burying her face in a dish
towel

  oh it cant eh the girl who
claimed to be normans wife burst
into the room if you dont be-
lieve me call the superintendent
norman always was unfaithful to
me but this is the most audacious
thing he ever did wait until i tell
aunt ellen-

  youll have to prove to me that
you- are mrs norris mabrue cut
in white as death but suddenly mis-
tress of herself

  look inside this ring then said
the other coldly

 mibrue took the wedding ring
she pulled off engraved inside it
was

from n n to d s --

   mabrue laid the ring back on the
table

   if that isnt enough look at
this the girl said taking up the
ring and throwing down a small
snapshot taken from her bag 

  mabrue bent to look at the pic-
ture there was no mistaking that
it was of norman and this girl fur-
thermore there was the signature
she had often seen on the lets be
gay cartoons

   noef-  -

and underneath it

and my-wife diane --

  it was sunday evening for
twenty-four hours mabrue had lain
on her bed in the ugly room she had
thought never to use again there
had been a few blessed hours when
she had slept awake she had been
on the rack of torturing thoughts

	things had blurred since she had
looked at the smiling pictured faces
 that had proved that norman had
lied to her and deceived her the
stab that had killed her faith in him
had done something terrible to her
she had heard diane norris say if
you werent such a sweet innocent-
looking little thing id have had the
police here instead of bothering with
proofs clear out before i change
my mind 

  the only thing mabrue took out
of all norman had bought was a
pair of stockings she had put her
darned ones on the dumb-waiter
with the rubbish she had hesitated
about the hat but had left it and
departed bare-headed

  thinking of the hat which had
started it all she wept anew

  awake mabrue asked a girls
anxious voice from the doorway

  please leave me alone marge
mabrue sobbed

marge came in and shut the door
violet eyes



mrs norris stared at mabrue haughtily so my guess was right
youre one of normans friends you little pirate ive a mind to tear

your eyes out

i risked her smelling the toast she
said cheerfully so youll have to
eat it and drink the tea

she came over to the bed and
switched on the light

mabrue sat up and blinked
youre sweet marge she said

she drank the hot tea thirstily and
nibbled at the toast

wont you tell me all about it
honey coaxed the visitor then
harshly there are laws in this

land you know if some guy-

marge ive told you all there


street  smiths love story magazine

is to tell its not what you think
she gave back the plate and cup
may i have your newspaper to
look for a job please

  ill get it but honestly honey
youve got me scared

  while mabrue looked through the
want ads marge read

  suddenly marge giggled well
if this dame isnt wearing the twin
to your hand-me-down lid ill eat
the paper she cried out

  it was the name that mabrue saw
first-norman norris then his
picture he was with a handsome
elderly woman whowas wearing the
old hat she had given him mabrue
with a little cry seized the news
sheet	-

  her heart pounding madly she
read the account of the funeral of
a wealthy jerseyite which norman
norris famous cartoonist and miss
ellen bradburst norris daughter of-
the late senator wade norris had
attended 

  monday evening found mabrue
and marge in the latters room
they had just eaten asketchy meal
cooked over the - forbidden electric
grill

  monday in the housewares is no
picnic yawned marge but i bet
you feel worse than i after tramp-
ing all day and not finding a job
you should have bought a -smart
hat as i told you she chided never
guessing how she was hurting ma-
brue my beret looks cute on you
but its not the right lid to go job
hunting in that reminds me the
dame with the twin of your hand-
me-down is hogging the headlines
in again to-night

  mabrue turned cold with terror
he-she isnt-hurt or anything
robbed take the paper along
with you im going to lie down

  mabrue hurried to her own room
with the newspaper

  under the picture which had
appeared the day before was the
headline

new racket-priceless china
stolen ransom demanded
when miss norris and her nephew nor-
man norris creator of the popular syndi-
cated cartoon lets be gay returned
to their murray hill apartment this morn-
ing they discovered that the choicest pieces
of miss norriss famous collection of ori-
ental china had been stolen

  the thief had left a note which read
you can have your stuff back for five
thousand dollars i shall phone instruc-
tions monday

  a girl named mary brown hired by
mr norris to guard  the china is being
sought in--

  mabrue read no more

  her mind in chaos she slipped
downstairs to the  telephone in the
hallway she found normans num-
ber in the directory and dialed it
her heart was thumping so it shook
her body he had said hello
three times before she could answer
she said

  norman this is mabrue i

didnt take the china nor-

  mabrue his voice shouted i
know you didnt say they didnt
kidnap you too did they he cried
in alarm

  no they may have kidnaped
-your wife

 diane how did you know
about her he asked harshly

  mabrue replaced the receiver and
stumbled blindly upstairs

  in her room she collapsed on the
bed

i norman had lied to her deceived
her his own words had confirmed
that sobs shook her great tear-
ing sobs but her eyes were dry

  she became aware of loud voices
heavy footsteps then a pounding on
her door and a demand that she

crushed her hand the thought of

  some one did mabrue inter-
posed that girl diane she had
your ring and a picture of you both
with your signature on it

  egad why did she show up after
all these years how did she know

was she who took the stuff

  it was diane they had at the
thirtieth street station once more
mabrue faced her but this time
norman was at her side even so
mabrue turned away from the un-

  masked hatred in the other
  girls eyes

     you stole the stuff nor-
  man asked incredulously

     it was the desk sergeant
  who answered she did mr
  norris we found it all at
  her apartment after she had
  spoken to your aunt she
  had implicated the superin-
  tendent of your apartment
  si house they seem to be
  friends and he tipped her off
  that there was only a young
  lady in your apartment and
  she must be very important
  to you seeing the way he was
  ordered to look out for her
  this is the young lady
  sergeant miss milburn and
  i are engaged

     diane spoke for the first
  time in a voice that dripped
  venom she said i pity you
  youngster and i hope he gives
  you a better deal than he gave
  me the snob

    i had no intention of
broadcasting the facts of our
unhappy union norman said
sharply but youve asked for
it by that remark i was able
to have our marriage annulled be-
cause it was proved that you had
gone through the wedding ceremony
several times before you met me
without bothering about divorces
also you had served time for black-
mail

  mabrue didnt look at the other
girl as the officer silenced the angry
tirade that followed normans de-
nunciation of her

  norman asked may miss mil-
burn and i go sergeant

miss milburn may youve got
to stay and make the charge
mabrue joined marge waiting in
another room marge had evidently
not waited for norman to find out
street  smiths love story magazine

about the marital status of the red-
headed cop for they were laughing
together like old friends

  mr  casey is seeing me home
mabrue she said shall i wait
until mr norris is finished

  no run along telephone me at
his apartment she grew rosy ill

marge

  presently mabrue and norman
were driving through  the busy
streets to the quieter murray hill
section outside the door he took
her in his arms you do-love me
he asked tenderly

  yes but i cant seem to think

that-

  when one is in love one doesnt
think sweetest one only  feels
tell me what you feel darling one
she whispered tenderly 

  i feel that all the love i am capa-
ble of is going out to you

  my own sweetheart he mur-
mured he laid his lips on hers in
a kiss that sent the blood racing
hotly through her she clung to
him in the dimness every fiber of
her being vibrant throbbing as she
gave him back kiss for kiss

  to-morrow  he said huskily
will be our wedding day lets go
tell aunt ellen that alls well you
must not be afraid of her sweet-
heart- shes really a kindly soul

  i fear nothing when you are with
me to-morrows husband she mur-
mured

  as he carried her  upstairs he
asked want to slide down again
or shall i spank you

-	she laughed and nestled closer in
his embrace

  after norman had told aunt
ellen that it was diane who had
stolen the china which he assured
her was - quite safe and would be
returned he brought mabrue to her
it took the elderly lady a full three
minutes to inspect the younger one

	then she exclaimed youll do
child and kissed mabrue heartily

  presently she resumed her doze
only to start awake and glance at
the lovers on the divan talking ear-
nestly where does your aunt buy
her hats mabrue she demanded
but mabrue and norman were lost
to everything save their own happy
plans so with a resigned shrug
aunt ellen turned away

chapter viii

a sickening sensation swept
bobbie hulda and red arm
in arm were entering the
store hesitating a minute at the
door with the rays of the setting
sun a shaft of gold before them

  huldas braids caught its gleam
and shone yellow as wheat at har-
vest time against reds towering
shoulder he was saying something
to her smiling down at her his
white teeth shining

they took a table not three feet
from bobbie her back was toward

l


 j street  smiths love story magazine

them but she watched in a little
mirror that faced her on the wall
as they settled themselves and as
red gave their order by reaching
over her shoulder and back a little
she could have touched reds arm
but hulda was hidden behind his
broad-shouldered form- it was
huldas low sweetly heavy voice
however that heldbobbie frozen

  i wont be able to see you
again she was saying i dont
dare red coming in here like this
is crazy bill is terribly jealous
hes blaming me for everything
he-swears im double-crossing him
and if he ever finds out that im
meeting you like this hell do some-
thing dreadful to both of us

  bobbie gasped

  then reds low rumble sounded
comforting cautioning soothing
and his brown hand covered the
gills strong white one her eyes
glued on the mirror before her bob-
bie watched his bent head in a
turmoil of bitter rebellion she
thought

  what has she to give red that i
couldnt why must he go to a girl
like that for love

  it seemed an eternity to bobbie
waiting there in the soft dusk be-
fore they moved but when  they
had gone out to the street at last
and following she had stood foran
instant in the shadow of the awning
watching them go their different
ways she had seen what they
hadnt some one else watching
too-bill nolan she knew by the
great blacky anger of his lowering
face that he had seen what she had
arid her heart was a twist of fear
and shame-fear for reds safety
and shame that she could fear

  it was long after sundown when
she reached home the cottage was
unlit deserted even her father

  was gone from his chair on the
porch 

  leaning against the rail she
stared down into the valley below

  with a strange tired listlessness
she thought i suppose i ought to
warn red about nolan but i cant
and anyway he couldnt do any-
thing to-night hes probably down
on the bridge now and hell be there
till he goes off duty to-morrow
morning i could go down and tell
tim- but id probably run into pitt
and honey making love to each
other somewhere in the moon-
light 

  her lip curled love what was
it anyway-this thing they called
love-this thing that could tear
ones heart into little pieces

  when she could stand the loneli-
ness and silence no longer she went
down to the office wheres every-
body she asked and a draftsman
bending over a blue print looked up
at her from visor-shaded eyes

  chiefs gone to the city he told
her a wire came late this after-
noon carson drove him to the train
said to tell you hed be back day
after to-morrow sure miss ash-
ton was round here a little while
ago but shes disappeared isnt
she up at the cottage

  honey there was a startled
catch in bobbies throat didnt
she drive in with them then
prompted by a fear she wouldnt
acknowledge even to herself she
added

  wheres tim do- you know
where i can find him

  the man laughed say youd
better stay away from that old boy
hes on a rampage theres dyna-
mite missing from the storehouse
and hes got blood in his eye

  but his last words were lost on
an empty doorway on the swish of
primitive love



  a swiftly vanishing figure and the
  cry of a hoot owl from a withered
  stump that once had been a tree

   bobbie found tim down where
  the forms for the last almost-com-
  pleted arch rose ghostly against a
  star-dotted sky

    tim she gasped is it true
  is there dynamite missing from the
  storehouse they told -me at the
  office is it true

    true a firefly split the dusk

 tim slapped at it angrily aint
  you been raised round camps like
  this gal dont you know we
  check every stick of dynamite thats
  used-every cap and inch of fuse
  sure its missing and believe me
  ive got ten men pacing this bridge
  to-night im going to keep them
  pacing it every night from now on
  until were through one try at
  blowing us up is enough there
  aint going to be another-not while
  your dads gone anyway

   bobbie grabbed his arm and
  shook it her voice was shrill with
  terror

    oh tim you fool she cried

-	its not your bridge thats going to
  be- blown up to-night dont you
  see its honey shes stolen your
  dynamite shes going to do that
  fool thing you told her to do the
  other night up at the cottage shes
  going to blow a hole in bear creek
  and flood red out where is she
  have you seen her anywhere
  think tim think

    no i aint seen her whats the
  matter heat got you tim was
  irritated why that kid couldnt
  blow a hole in a tin can shes
  scared to touch the stuff squealed
  like a mouse if i poked it at her
  get out now and leave me alone
  swear if i blame red for spanking
  you id do it myself goldarn it
  if you was a year or so younger

  he yanked his arm loose and
made his way into the maze of giant
footings his lantern swinging
carefully ahead of him sent tiny
light beams among the towering
timbers-beams that grew fainter
and fainter to lose themselves at
last in the shadowy gloom

  as bobbie watched him disap-
pear utter despair swept her no
one would believe her-tim her
father laughing thinking her crazy
but she knew she knew what love
could do to a girl to what heights
or what depths it could drag her

  honey had stolen that dynamite
bobbie was as certain of it as 
though her own eyes had witnessed
the theft for days honey had
been brooding over what tim in his
blind fooling had suggested-been
planning for it and she had taken
this opportunity when she was left
alone to go over to reds camp and
blow that hole in the bank of bear
creek-

  what motive but that could have
kept honey hanging around tims
heels that hot morning learning
how to set a blast watching how
dynamite was laid   

  oh what an idiot she had been
what a blind self-centered idiot-
so wrapped up in her own troubles
she couldnt see what lay right be-
fore her eyes

  that white-iron look in honeys
face should have told her if nothing
else had she remembered  those
eager questions honey had thrown
at her father and tim if-if
some one let the water down on
reds camp would that mean youd
win the bonus would that mean
youd win the hundred thousand
dollars

   and above all else the love in her
eyes when they had rested on pitt
that awful avid hunger of love

  and before bobbie knew what she
	street  smiths love story magazine

vas going to do before she could
reason or plan her feet were carry-
ing her up the river path which led
to reds camp she was running as
she never before had run in all her
motherless tomboy life-like a wild
thing through the weedy knee-high
grass

  honey knew that path red had
taken them all over it to show them
the dam they had stopped at the
bank of the diverted river overlook
ing the camp while red explained
how once the dam was finished it
was to be swung back into its old
channel orlce more

  thats where honey would head
for-that  place above the camp
something inside bobbie told her
so it seemed to bobbie that she
could see honey running too terror-
stricken lugging her awful burden
poor foolish love-crazed honey

  there were clouds in the skv-
smoke clouds from those far-away
fires-that covered the moon
through them the  stars peeped fit-
fully as though they too were
afraid and the night breathed itself
into the croak of the frogs and the
crickets never-ending chirp

  -stumbling over briers stones and
weeds bobbie had reached the rise
of ground that led up to the newly
made river bank when she came on
honey at last	 

  she was lying face down in the 
dirt the twist of dynamite sticks
was beside her a tangled line of
fuse soaked with dew trailed like a
white worm in the weeds her
pretty white dress was a torn rag
about her she was crying her
shoulders shakingwith the sobs that
became words to lose themselves
with the medley of night sounds
that filled the air

  she heard bobbie and sitting up
turned to her a swollen face that
was beyond fear

  i cant do it i cant i thought
i could blow up the old creek and
-and i cant i dont know how to
set it off and im so scared

  she struck a match and in its
light bobbie saw that the ground
was a litter of matches all about
her she made an effort to set the
fuse -to burning it sizzled splut-
tered and bobbie ground it out be-
neath her boot snatching - at
honeys shoulders she yanked her
 upright and shook her until reason
came back into her blankly staring
eyes 

	but with reason there came to
honey something else-terror it
was a terror that swept her as the
flood she had been trying so vainly
to release would have swept red
and his sleeping camp below

  watching her bobbie saw her try
to scream there was something un-
speakably dreadful about the
scream- that died against dry
parched  lips--something horrible
abolit the -white-rimmed wide-
opened eyes and the white outflung
hands that shielded her as she
backed away down the path into- 
the meadow below

  bobbie watched her as she ran
her white dress billowing about her
like a straying moonbeam lost in the
smother of the night

  standing where honey had left
her bobbie poked gingerly at the
smudging fuse touched with the
tips of her boots the dynamite
sticks in their- yellow wrappings 
dull anger gripped her

  fll have to gather this stuff all
up and sneak it back into tims
storehouse she told herself ill
have to shield honey as ive -
shielded red ill have to go on

lying pretending- oh im sick

of it im sick of everything

  she was still standing there the
dynamite sticks under one arm a
primitive love



length of white fuse trailing for- he simply stared down at her
iornly from a listless hand when with eyes too sad for anger

red found her

coming up from the	 r

camp below his foot-
steps softened by the
matted gras he was
standing almost beside
her -i before she heard
him it was that
strange sweet haunting
of his nearness that
brought her swinging
breathlessly toward
him for he said noth-
ing at all

suddenly bobbie came upon honey she was lying face down in the
dirt and crying her shoulders shaking with sobs i cant do it i thought
i could blow up the old creek but i dont know how to set it off


street  smiths love story magazine

  a seed pod from a locust tree
dropped with a dry rattle to the
ground at bobbies feet the lights
fromthe sprawling camp below
made-a crazy-quilt pattern against
the night her heart pounding high
in her throat choked her

   wearily red leaned over his tall
 body bending awkwardly from the
 hips wearily he gathered up the
 length of trailing fuse and tore it
 loose from its cap

   for a girl whos been raised in a
 construction camp he said thats
 a pretty bum job bobbie thought
 id taught you how to handle pow-
 der better than that and besides
 -his eyes swept the bank and
 turned with careful judging to the
  black-shadowed valley with its
 glimmering lights--youre not far
 enough up the slope to do much
 good its a shame -but i guess
 there isnt anything for you to do
 but to take your stuff and trot back
 home 	-

  and bobbie answered him too
tired to fight- too hopeless to try an
explanation yes i guess there
isnt red and stumbling a little
her feet found the river path

	she slept that night in her
fathers room through the crude
partition she could hear honeys
sobs

   she cant be any more miserable
than i am bobbie thought dully
and turned her face to the wall
grateful for the utter and over-
whelming weariness that like a
sedative brought her blessed for-
getting 

-	the light was streaking through
her window when she awakened at
last to a strangely familiar voice-
sandy mcmasters its high-
pitched thin tones cut through the
walls to her ears

   all right pitt garson if bob

brent aint here he aint but
wheres that tomboy kid of his
get her out here where i can talk
to her

  reds gone i tell you hes
been kidnaped-maybe murdered
if she knows anything about it im
going to find out anything thats
ever happened to red to hurt him
came through her

  she was hanging round our
camp last night i saw red and
her talking together up on the bluff
and when he come back down some-
thing ailed him he got in his car
and drove off toward town and
never came home the cars stand-
ing empty up at the top of the hill
theres  blood marks in it and a
piece of his shirt all torn and bloody
caught on the fender 	

  dont think i havent heard
what youve been saying over here--
spreading stories that were double-
crossing you red and me lies
dirty lies if it hadnt been for
red holding me back id been oyer
 here long ago and cleaned up on
the pack of you but if youvedone
anvthing to red if youve dared
to-

   bobbies feet struck the floor with
a bang she thrust her arms into
an old bath robe of her fathers it
trailed the floor sweeping fantasti-
cally about her

  it had been four years and more
since she had heard sandy mcmas-
ters voice but listening the room
seemed to fade away the years for-
gotten and she was standing a
child-wife with her boy-husband
beside her shivering before this
same thin pipe of anger uncon-
sciously she looked down at her
hand expecting reds fingers to be
clasping it protectingly

  and suddenly all her hatred and
suspicion were gone all the shame
that these awful last days had

ls-f
primitive love



 added to four years of heartbreak
 and hunger were swept away in one
 wild panic of terror

   what was this awful thing sandy
 was saying about reds being kid-
 naped-about his empty blood-
 stained car

   a small white-faced figure with
 huge gray eyes beneath tousled
 brown hair an oddly pathetic fig-
 ure lost in the great bath robe that
 enveloped her bobbie threw her-
 self from her room

   uncle sandy she crieji snatch-
 ing at his arm and her eyes through
 their unbelievable lashes were white-
 rimmed with the fear that widened
 them oh uncle sandy i do

	know whats happened to red i
 do its bill nolan hes jealous of
 red and a girl up at the junction
 he-he saw red with her yester-
 day oh i should have warned
 him i did see red last night but
 i-i-there were other things and

then-

  the old man looked at her
 other things he grunted sure
 fighting i suppose like you always
 did-you two cant live together
 and cant live apart and if you
 say my reds got himself mixed up
 with any junction trash you lie
 he aint im his father and i know
 even this new girl hes got himself
 engaged to cant keep him from
 breaking his heart over you

   pitt thrust himself forward his
 face was gray but his eyes were
 black and hot fright fought with
 the anger that filled them-a fright
 that bobbie saw and that multi-
 plied itself to her own wild terror

   fastening his fingers on bobbies
 sleeve he swung her behind him
 he said to sandy i dont know
 anything about bobbies being over
 at your place last night and i dont
 know anything about what shes
 just been telling you but if your
 ls-f

precious red  has been playing
round with bill nolans girl and
nolan caught him at it hes prob-
ably got whats coming to him
for nolans disappeared he didnt
show up for work last night and he
hasnt been near so far this morn-
ing find him if you can i cant
and i want him worse than you
do

  the old man was stamping down
the steps when bobbie found her
voice

  uncle sandy she sobbed hys-
terically oh uncle sandy take me
with you let me hunt red with
you i love him ill do anything
to find him but against that
stubborn disappearing back bob-
bies voice trailed off into a futile
wail and pit was talking to her his
voice knife-edged

  if youre through making a fool
of yourself and of me id like your
story and id like it straight
what do you know about red and
hulda and bill nolan i want to
know whats being going on round
here behind my back

  there has been too much going
on behind every ones backs bob-
bie cried and told him of red and
hulda in the drug store the day be-
fore of what hulda had said of
nolan who had watched them and
of the hate in his eyes

  when she had finished she said
calm with the calmness of utter de-
spair

  and now hes killed red and
its my fault for not warning him
then with rising  passion last

night- oh i could kill myself

talking with him-having him right
there before me-and not telling
him

  theres another little thing id
like to know about pitt broke in
thickly his face a twist of fury
what were you doing over at the




street  smiths love story magazine

mcmaster camp last night with-
out waiting for an answer he con-
tinued furiously what is this---
a race between you and hulda
youve got to a pretty level when
you play yourself against a girl like
her for that double-crossers favors
the minute your fathers out of
sight running after him-

  she-she didnt run after red
she ran after me

  the words came from honeys
opened door and hearing them
pitts voice dribbled off into ahalf-
muttered sneer swinging to follow
his startled eyes bobbie found her
own angry denial stilled on her
tongue

  honey was standing there a wan
white-faced honey with mussed
golden hair and swollen tear-
dimmed eyes her negligee trailed
its froth of silk and lace about her
her shoulders rose from it white as
milk and her mouth was curled into
a pitiful crimson droop like a
babys mouth soft with pleading -

  oh pitt she wailed pitt i
cant stand it any more take me
away please pitt take me away
from this awful place it does things
to people---terrible things last
night i tried to bomb the river bank
the way old tim said up here at the
cottage  bobbie doesnt love you
she told me so she said she
wouldnt marry you  ever and i
thought-i thought maybe if i
could give you the bonus money if
i could bring you something big
youd love me so much youd want
to marry me instead then you
wouldnt mind the old company
youre so crazy after but i
couldnt i didnt know how and
then bobbie found me and i ran
away-- her voice broke

  pitt laughed-ra strange laugh
that died against thin drawn lips

   you tried to blow a hole in that
river bed because you loved me
you thought youd be doing a big
tiling for-me if we won the bonus
you little fool didnt i tell you to
be patient that i had a scheme-to 
leave things to me doing a fool
thing like that-and now nolan
who knows whats happened there
murder maybe he swung on
 bobbie his face contorted his lips
twitching 	

   -youve got this much you might  
as well have the rest he snarled
ive been gambling for a big stake r
and ive lost its got away from
me-the whole thing money am-
bition the girl a fellow loves-
those were the things i was fighting
for and i didnt care much how i
fought either but when it comes

to murder- he broke off his

expression horrified then

  why in heavens name did red
have to go sticking his nose into
things that didnt concern him
why didnt he do as any sane man
would have done-let the bonus
come his way and been glad in-
stead of that hes been spying
sneaking using nolans girl to
checkmate every move ive made 

watching everything i did-

   all her life bobbie was to remem-
 ber the sudden white flood of under-
 standing that swept her one-minute
 pitt was there before her his words 
 a meaningless jumble in her terror-
 stricken brain and the next he had
 vanished wiped out in the flame
 that had burst within her-a clean
 white flame that pierced the dark
 muddle that for so long had been
 her mind

  oh i know i know she was
crying ive been so blind its
true what red told me hes been
fighting for us-for dad and me-
all this time just as he said he was
youve never wanted to win
primitive love



oh pitt honey wailed take me away from this awful place
bobbie doesnt love you she told me so she saidshe wouldnt marry
you ever  you love me marry me instead

that bonus pitt you and nolan	bomb the form sheds with the fuse

have been behind all these terrible	that red found and stamped out

things that have happened hiding	you thought dad would turn the

those crates that red found and	company over to you as he said he

brought back to tim trying to	would and you could marry honey


street  smiths love story magazine

and have the company too you
thought you could blame it all on
red and you could have if it
hadnt been for hulda and the fact
that red loved me he loved me
her voice swinging like a bell
against the silence rose to a cre-
scendo of triumph she flung her
arms above her head and the sun
sweeping through the open door
flooded her face

  red darling youve loved me
all the time oh why havent i
seen before how could have i
been so blind

  she caught at pitts arm dont
you see she sobbed hulda loved
bill nolan she knew what he was
doing and she was scared she
wanted to-to save him she told
red the things bill told her so red
could keep them from happening
she knew they could have sent no-
lan to the penitentiary if theyd
caught him and nolan thought
she was in love with red and so

he-he--

  a sob broke in bobbies throat- 
a terrified ghost of a sob the
glory in her face faded to a pale
horror of realization and her words
died to a whisper that lost itself
against bloodless lips

  and now hes got red hes
killed him maybe oh help me
dear god please help me

  unconsciously her fingers were
still clutchingpitts arm he shook
them free

  im after nolan he cried and
his-voice trailed back over his shoul-
der while his feet sent the gravel
and sticks to flying on the downhill
path	

  wait bobbie wailed wait
pitt and then she was tearing on
her clothes smoothing her tumbled
hair with mad hands lacing boots
with racing fingers she ran down
the path toward the bridge banging

through the office door scattering
papers

  wheres pitt- she threw at the
startled faces that looked up at her
wild entrance but even as she
asked she knew what the answer
would be

  he had taken the car and gone
making noexplanation 

  she found tim he was seventy
feet up in the air walking the
scaffolding of the new arch direct-
ing the pour the place was fever-
ish with hurry filled with turmoil

  tim she shrieked ive got
to see you tim he saw her and
waved her away she started to go
to him climbing monkeylike by
the framework but a mans hands
clutched at her and pulled her back

  leaning down from his dizzy
height tim bellowed through
cupped hands get that crazy kid
out o here if you have to chloro-
form her want the old man to
come back and find her killed

  in a frenzy of desperation bobbie
fought and struggled she bit hit
and kicked then suddenly she
quieted and the mans arms
dropped from her

  her attempt to reach tim and
the utter abandon of terror that had
swept her at its failure had cleaned
her mind of the fog that had held it
she tried to plan as calmly as her
pounding heart would let her

  every minute every second
counted she mustnt lose a single
one with her father gone with
tim refusing to see her there was
only one place left to turn that
vas-hulda

  if i goto her bobbie thought
and ask her to help me find nolan
shell help me if i show her my
heart and whats in it she cant re-
fuse me shell help me save red
because she knows what it is to love
primitive love



because in saving my man shell
save hers

  even as her thoughts took shape
forming themselves into words that
cried against her lips she was run-
ning toward a battered old car that
stood parked by the office door it
was an errand car left in gear its
engine- running while its driver
stood with hands full of packages
half in half out the opened door

  she pushed him aside the impact
of her flying body sending him
gasping stumbling she climbed to
the seat her foot hard on the gas
she swung intoa one-wheeled turn
then she was racing away

  she heard some one yelling at
her hey hey where you go-
ing where you taking that car
stop and she laughed her laugh
trailing crazily back above the en-
gines roar

chapter ix

  bobbie found hulda in the
kitchen of the huge dingy old hotel
she was alone the noon rush was
over and she was washing the floor
her capable hands were wet and
soapy her gingham dress clung
wetly to her and damp wisps of
hair escaping from the golden
braids that wound her head clung
to her cheeks her eyes were swol-
len with crying and marring the
flushed beauty of her peasant face
a livid bruise darkened cheek lip
and broad low brow it was a hor-
rible bruise that made bobbie
wince and cringe

  nolan hulda said sullenly in
answer to bobbies stammered ques-
tioning how should i know where
bill nolan is that man carson
came over here a minute ago too
asking me the same thing im tell-
ing you nothing ive done too
much telling already for my own

good and she touched her cheek
her eyes hard

  nolan gave me that she said
for trying to keep him out of the
pen then with sudden passion
i hate men theyre all alike-
beasts

  it wasnt until bobbie had
blurted out her story from dry
parched lips of what she had seen
at the drug store the night before-
of nolans watching hate-filled face
of reds disappearance and the
blood-stained empty car-that
hulda broke down

  flinging herself in a chair she
buried her braided head in her
arms bills done it she sobbed
he threatened to do it hes
killed red mcmaster he came in
here last night drunk and swore he
was going to get him and he has
hes taken him to that shack of his
up in the hills and hes-hes killed
him and its all my fault be-
cause i tried to save him because
i mixed in when i had no business
to because-

  bobbie cried shack what
shack where she shook the
heaving shoulders she threw her
questions down at the half-crazed
girl repeating them over and over
until hearing at last hulda raised
her bruised tear-swollen face

  it wont do no good she said
heavily it wont do no good to go
there i know it wont its-its
over with by this time whatever
he was going to do to red hes
done and if hes still there-and
drunk-hell kill us both as well

  bcbbie laughed mirthlessly a
lot id care what he did to me if hes
killed red she said

  looking at bobbie silently for a
moment the girl answered her rich
soft voice heavy with the tears be-
hind it

  a girl doesnt care much about

shack and jumping up dressed
as she was she followed bobbie out
to the car

  bobbie never forgot that ride on
the logging road up the mountain
side axle deep in ruts the acrid
tang of burning forests that hedged
them in the silence broken only by
the scrape of the low-hung branches
and the throb-throb of the car

  with huidas soft gutturals to
guide her bobbie followed the twist-
ing vvay where the road wound
round an outspreading cliff a path
shot off-a footpath which ordi-
narily would have been hidden by
bunches of sumac laurel and wild
grapevines but now the vines
were torn loose the ground was lit-
tered with leaves and broken
branches and caught on a twig and
fluttering there was the torn sleeve
of a mans khaki shirt like a sign
pointing the way

  there was no need of words bob-
bie stopped the car she climbed
out and hulda followed her they
put stones beneath the wheels

  bobbie said youd better go
first hulda you know the way
ill follow haste seemed to have
left her an awful quiet held her
in its grip paralyzing her fear
the noise of her pounding heart and
her labored breathing worried her
in a strange detached way

 even with the tumbled-down
weed-grown shack ahead of them at
last standing with hulda beside its
open door looking inside she still
clung to that dreadful stillness

  it wasnt until she saw red-un-
til she met his wide-open eyes and
heard his voice calling her name
that it broke-that she found her
voice and answered her name with
his

  he was lying bound on a rude cot
in a corner of the tiny cabin there
was a bandage about his flaming

head his face was white and hol-
low-eyed and caked with blood and
dust his clothes were torn but he
was smiling at her with the t ender -
est the sweetest smile it seemed to
bobbie she ever had seen

  but before she could move before
she could reach him to sob out her
pleas for love and forgiveness he
was crying at her

  bobs quick find a knife and
cut me loose pitts over there
somewhere and heaven knows
what condition hes in and that
maniac of a nolans on his way back
to the valley to burn the bridge and
the dam-make a clean sweep of the
works before he comes back here
to finish up on us there isnt a
minute to lose

 then she was on her knees beside
him hacking with an old kitchen
knife at the ropes that held him let-
ting her lips lie for an instant against
his chafed and bleeding wrists free-
ing his ankles and holding him his 
long frame towering above her as
he swayed stiffly and stamped the
blood back into his numbed  arid -
aching feet	

  over in a dark corner they saw
hulda and went to her she was
shivering and touching a sprawling
body with fearing hands

  red pushed her aside and took
her place for a long minute he
listened then raising himself upon
feet still unsteady he laughed
thats pitt hulda but dont
worry he isnt dead hes only
out that bill of yours-he sure
packs an awful wallop as hulda
and bobbie looked at him startled
he explained

  he came up here about an hour
ago and tried to make nolan let me
loose they had a scrap-about the
prettiest scrap ive ever seen but
theres no time to gas about it now
weve got to bring pitt to and get


street  smiths love story magazine

going if were going to save the
bridge and the dam and keep that
darned crazy fool bill of yours from
running himself into the pen in spite
of everything we can do lets get
busy

  they brought water and doused
pitt with it they shook pounded
and thumped they got him at
last groggy and only half-conscious
down the narrow path to the parked
car and pulled him in the blow
that had felled him had been a ter-
rible one his
lips were green-
edged his skin
yellow paste

  in spite of his
sickness he tried
to talk drive
like the devil

he will try - the
bridge first wed
planned one more
go for to-night

ive been crook
long enough im
comingclean

he stopped ex-
hausted then
after a while

  well save those jobs-yours and
brents if i die for it and what-
ever they hand me im taking
afterwards if honey still loves me
were beating it back to the east
where we belong honey and i
this  is  your world mcmaster
yours and bobbies not honeys and
mine

  but red said nothing at all he
was too busy his lips grim his eyes
on the road before him his knuckles
showing taut and white on the
wheel		-

  it had been a long slow drive up
it was a long drive back but not a
slow one they teetered and
tipped and swayed branches
cracked above them the gravel flew

beneath their flying wheels there
was the roar of the exhaust the
splutter and throb of the pounding
engine the junction with its lights
whizzing by like fireflies in the dark-
ness and then the valley road un-
rolling its dusty white ribbon before
them

 it was on the ridge where
through the break in the trees bob-
bie had had her first view of the
bridge that red slowed then
brought the car to a sudden stop

   look he
 said good
 heaven look

     and following
  his pointing fin-
  -ger bobbie saw
  what she had
  seen on that first
  and never-to-be-
  forgotten evening
  -the bridge-
  but not as she
  had seen it then
  a fairy thing
  against a moonlit
  sky	

  there was
    	nothing fairylike

about it now it was frightening
terrible there were smoke clouds
rolling up from it and long tongues
of fire licking greedily at the black
night sky even where they stood
the smell of fresh burning wood
came up to them to mix with the
stale smoke scent of the heavy air

  for a moment they stared

  were too late bobbie cried
miserably while pitt groaned and
hulda covered up her face with her
hands but red was out of the car
running down the hill and shouting
back to bobbie

  take the car on down to the
bridge im getting help tell tim 
ill bring them along the river path
-every man weve got all the -
primitive love



pumps and hose step on it bob-
bie tell him to keep fighting
what happened after that was al-
ways a dream to bobbie-a feverish
nightmare of incidents crowding one
upon another across the turbid
background of a weary confused
brain

  as they swung wildly into the
circle of light that was their camp
dark sweaty soot-streaked figures
flocked about them hands grabbed
at pitt and helped him to the
ground then at bobbie they were
tims hands he was naked to the
waist his thin ribbed body heaved
as he talked dried tobacco juice
dripped with the sweat down the
crevices of his chin-

  at pitt he croaked great
supe you are where you been
nolan fired the gasoline tanks if
the blaze catches the false work
were gone hes crazy drunk we
got him tied up down at the office
and to bobbie his tiny eyes gim-
let holes in his nutcracker face get
up to the cottage an fix bandages
and liniment and get a bed ready
that darned fool yellow-haired
friend of yourn-that gal from the
city-shes hurt she found nolan
nd give the alarm just as he set
off the pump and the flames got

her shes hurt bad she-

  and then the old man was crying
his face twisting the tears streak-
ing his dirty cheeks the kid and
the bridge-the whole business he
blubbered its going to kill your
pap bobbie if sandy was here
now or red if they was fighting

with me if-

  bobbie caught his arm look
she cried down by the river
path tim look theyre coming
-red and uncle sandy and the
whole mcmaster crew

 they did come-trucks and
chemicals men and water pumps

hose and buckets they swarmed
over the place flooding it

  red sweat-streaked his hair
flaming crimson as the flames he
fought his bandages bloodstained
and horrible was everywhere
snatching single-handed at burning
timbers directing and giving cour-
age to tims tired-out men as well
as to tim himself

 and sandy mcmaster became
old sandy himself once more
swearing at the blazes as he fought
against them

  but bobbie back in the cottage
where they had carried honey-the
doctor from the junction pitt and
herself-neither saw nor heard she
was too busy there was water to
boil oil-soaked clothes to hand to
the doctors motioning hand instru-
ments to sterilize pitt tried to
help he was useless his hands
shook like a babys his eyes were
dimmed with  tears he found a
chair beside honeys bed and
slumped there his head in his
hands his eyes never leaving her
small pain-racked face

  daylight was breaking  when
bobbie finding time to breathe at
last leaned against the balcony rail
and stared down into the smoke-
filled mists below

  behind her honey was still at
last swathed in bandages she lay
white as the pillows that held her
pitt on his knees beside her had
his dark head buried against her
hand

  the doctor was leaving his
voice was tired but cheery his
eyes smiled

  shell be fine he said and she
wont bear a scar they taught us
how to treat burns right out at
the front shell be as pretty as
ever once those bandages are off
never fear

        pitt lifted a ravaged face and turned it toward them pretty he

   that was when pitt had spoken alive what do i care about her
 for the first time lifting a ravaged beauty beside her life and turn-

diane came in like something
windblown from the garden
the sunshine seemed to be
imprisoned in her hair with gay
tenacity

  mother isnt it marvelous

a lovelyday certainly diane
but i mean-about robert
imagine his turning up like this
after years and years with just this
week in town and then off to the

east as soon as he gets orders from
his office diane swiftly crossed
the floor with a dancing step slipped
onto the piano stool and accom-
panied a snatch of song

      on the road to mandalay
      where the flying fishes play-

  mother-she sprang up again-
if he should ask me youd let me
go wouldnt you i mean if he


street  smiths love story magazine

wanted me to join him out there

  diane how ridiculous mrs
trench moved quickly to her daugh-
ters side she held a duster in her
hand following up the inequalities
of the maids work and she seemed
prepared to brush aside dianes
ambitions which were quite as pre-
posterous as dust on the trench
furniture youve been seeing too
much of him gadding about with
him every morning noon and night
this week he-he hasnt said any-
thing she inquired anxiously

  not quite

  oh not quite-cynically
diane youre imagining things
youre reading into the affair what
isnt there of course it seems very
romantic his coming here like this
after you and he played together as
children as for the east-ridic-
ulous

  mrs trench moved further on in
her vigorous attack of the furniture
she was a large woman and handled
everything with a sort of repressed
fury it was easy-to see how she
had brought her campaign with
stephen trench to a victorious con-
clusion  only two years after the
death of his first wife the mother of
diane she was a good woman
efficient in the main tolerant but
without  imagination she resented
nothing in stephens first wife ex-
cept a strain of romance which she
could neither equal nor understand
as for the east-it was in the east
that stephen had met eleanor
agnes trench had resolutely set
herself to crush a silly romanticism
that threatened to crop up in diane
besides how could any one see any-
thing romantic in the east it was
a place not of romance mrs
trench assured herself but of fleas
and privations and heathen gods
and snakes that got under ones bed
-a most uncomfortable place per-

mit diane to go east ridiculous
  the telephone rang

  for you miss diane

  mrs trench watched her daugh-
ter go listened but could hear noth-
ing then diane came back her
eyes large and troubled

  it was robert hes got word to
go he has to take the eleven-thirty
train to-night and hell be busy
until this evening oh its horrid-
horrid  

  mrs trench felt herself safe in
 offering motherly sympathy in-
wardly she was highly relieved
hell be over this evening
yes mother well go for a
drive and-sudden color stained
her satinlike cheeks -her eyes be-
came distant and her voice dreamy
-hell tell me to-night--

  mrs trenchs voice sharpened
to-night she said crisply
yes of course now let me see
how appropriate a little farewell
party for robert- ice cream cake
flowers and candles

  but mother wed rather--
theres mrs prosser and lu
counted mrs trench quickly and
grandma prosser if her rheuma-
tisms better they all knew
robert as a boy of- course and
george milson is sure to be there
so attentive to lu and such a nice
young man she sighed then con-
tinued hastily as diane opened her
mouth to speak and do look up
aunt emilys number i never can
remember it she and uncle albert
of course must be asked

  but mother-

   diane youre not going to be un-
gracious when im only trying to do
something nice and appropriate for
robert before he goes

  n-no mother

  mrs trench nodded approvingly
and swept out of the room next
to diplomacy arrangements were
musical proposal



the breath of life to her she had
she thought managed this rather
well robert would have a chance
for serious conversation with diane
to-night only over her dead body
yvh a thing like this would upset
all her own plans for dikne

  stephen trench coming home at
five from the office found his house
embowered in flowers from the gar-
den his wife in her best gown and
diane wandering about like a lost
soul to look at stephen trench
was to see a typical suburbanite set-
tled down to middle-aged routine a
bit lined about the face a bit dull
about the eyes with a contentment
that was built on successive resigna-
tions only now and then stephen
was different touch one certain
chord in him and the man became
alive embers of -a lost youth flaring
up in him

  he stood in the hallway survey-
ing the proceedings

  have i forgotten a birthday or
something

  mrs trench came forward
briskly and with a half glance to-
ward the drawing room and diane
drew him aside explaining briefly
stephen trench took off his straw
hat and stroked the one wisp of hair
on his head that still grew under
careful cultivation with vaseline and
brush

   but is it quite fair to them
stephen you dont suggest that
i am not doing the right thing

  no no my dear only-

  why theyve only just met-at
least for the first time since child-
hood which doesnt count-and
with him going away at once why
should everything be upset i
know young girls shell fret and
pine for weeks maybe but in the
end wonder why shed been such a
fool and as for robert hell find
plenty of distractions out there

  you say hes going where
  mrs trench looked away

  the-oh out east in some out-
landish place she hurried on
it might be all right under other
circumstances but with two such
youngsters its just a passing fancy
and stephen i must ask you to back
me up we must get them through
until after eleven safely then hell
go away and with lots to think
about hell forget her but if they
have time to talk he may propose
something ridiculous and that we
mustnt allow you understand
stephen

   quite he said dryly

  she gave him a quick glance but
her lips said

  i know i could count on you
he tossed his hat on the rack and
went out into the garden for all
the filled bowls inside the paths
rioted with nasturtiums on both
sides hollyhocks waved in the
breeze from the picket fence and
leaves fluttered down from the trees
at the epd of the garden the wind
was soft but restless so that he
closed his eyes and remained still
letting it sweep over him feeling old
and despairing of his own courage
she could count on him yes of
course he was a fixture cemented
in by a thousand acceptances and
resignations he envied his wife her
sureness her victories her energy
feeling tired he sat on a garden
bench his hands touching the wood
felt a roughness his eyes went to
it in a silly moment of course
they had put it there carving it in
the newly bought bench-s-e
people thought it had to do with
compass directions and took wrong
bearings by it it stood for
stephen-eleanor good heavens
how long ago it seemed

   hello daddy

  heilo dear he looked up


street  smiths love story magazine

thinking shes more like her-
mother every day

	she sat down beside him

  has mother told you about
robert

  yes too bad he has to go like
this just when youve renewed
acquaintance its the way of the
world young lady he tried to
speak lightly he knew he was be-
ing a coward caught in the usual
diplomacy and insincerity of pre-
tending she said after a pause

  is it the-the way of the world
 to step on people deliberately
my dear

  oh you know daddy you
know why mothers doing all this
having people in pretending to be
nice to robert shes afraid-afraid
to let us be alone so she robs us
of the few hours we have i wont
stand for it her chin was re-
bellious

  he patted her hand

  your mother means well dear

 diane flung at him she thinks
the east is all horrid is it
stephen trench spoke only after
consideration	 

	the east is like the west diane
-not all good not all bad we
make whatever place we are in our-
selves we create it with our own
eyes our  minds and hearts he
paused then put a hand on her knee
the east- for me was a place of
miracle but so was this garden

  a voice called from the house
stephen diane could you help
me please there are some things
to bedone they faced each other
he patted her hand

-	try to remember diane dear
your mother means well shes
done a lot for both of us how
often had he said things like that
extending to diane the-bonds of his
own subjugation	 

   yes daddy ill try 

  mrs trench with smiling mouth
and unsmiling eyes welcomed them
as helpers in the rearrangement of
furniture everywhere one looked
were the earmarks of an occasion
she was determined to give robert
a good farewell

  aunt emily and uncle albert
came to share a hasty supper and
aunt emily was taken aside right
after and told the news uncle
albert was not permitted to enjoy
this confidence he had a frank
manner that was disconcerting he
never beat about the bush or said
things obliquely or fluttered ex-
pressive eybrows like aunt emily
he was declared the sisters en-
tirely lacking in subtlety though
there were strange disconcerting
moments when he spoke with his
tongue very much in his cheek
aunt emily unlike mrs trench
was pale and painted pictures not
unlike herself it was whispered
that her genius was burning her out
but the family doctor rudely said
her consumptive look was likely to
last out threescore and ten

  you did quite right agnes
agreed emily of course i knew
the pennels and robert once broke
one of my frames with stones when
he was quite a child but really his
mother was-well you remember
her-she was just a brunton as
for this eastern business it is quite
absurd

  agnes trench felt strenghtened
she was most gracious to robert
pennel when he arrived ushering
him immediately into the drawing
room calling sweetly to diane who
had been sent upstairs for something
unnecessary robert is here
diane dear aunt emily engaged
robert instantly - in conversation
she spoke in vague broken sen-
tences full of incomplete signifi-
cances the trend of which robert

ls-f
musical proposal	

for an instant diane and robert were together as he towered over
her she smiled up at him her eyes spoke volumes though her lips
merely said its horrid isnt it all these people

 had not time to get before other	on dianes every speech or act as

 guests arrived then conversation	soon as george milson arrived she
 became general  said they would play bridge

diane marooned across the room	do you think roberts changed

 could only exchange glances with	much she asked brightly he

 robert an adult and garrulous	seems just a boy to me still she

 world had swallowed them both	turned to the guest of course i

 mrs trench in a strategic position	didnt live here then robert just

 kept a silent but impressive guard	visited with the prossers

  ls-f


street  smiths love story magazine

   everybody looked at robert
 assessing him

   your -mother used to keep you
 very neat mused grandma pros-
 ser i declare she had your little
 pants out on the line every blessed
 day

   mother exclaimed mrs pros-
 ser

   and dianes were too asserted
 grandma vigorously she was al-
 ways goaded on by tactful inter-
 ference that was before your
 time agnes eleanor did her own
 washing then for myself i dont
 trust these laundries i--

   aunt emily interposed hastily
 have you seen the loan exhibit in
 town its not-that is to say-the
 modern you know in conflict dar-
 ing but a little cold

    the doorbell rang at this point

   theres george said mrs
 trench with relief george how
 good of you were just dying for
 some bridge i think you know
 every one oh robert this is
 george milson george robert
 pennel

   the young men shook hands
 from an obscure corner where he
 had hidden himself stephen trench
 sized them up george was a
 mouse-colored man eminently cor-
 rect in an artificial way against him
 roberts natural half-boyish ease
 warmed stephens heart george
 milson was perfectly suited to lu
 he thought they would be cere-
 moniously married furnish their
 house with scrupulous regard to con-
 servative standards obey every
 precept of matrimony implicity and
 die respected and unknown outside
 their own street stephen trench
 sighed he had pretty nearly got
 there himself and it was all right
 these people were the backbone of
 the social order he had no doubt
 they hadnt enough imagination to

 go wrong you couldnt expect
 backbones to get out of shape sud-
 denly stephen laughed to himself
 but diane shot him a glance-hurt
 dismayed in the next instant al-
 most hopeful-and his humor died

  they were moving to the tables
now for an instant diane and
robert were together as he
towered over her his eyes fixed on
her she smiled up at him her eyes
spoke volumes though her lips
merely said

  im sorry its horrid isnt it
all these people

  stephen saw their young misery
through these mutual smiles and lie
experienced a fierce pang a desire
to jump up and cry out that this
room these people this bridge was
a sacrilege against youth romance
and a summer night

  stephen mrs trenchs voice
brought him to earth will you
fetch the punch dear you dont
mind not playing do you and
then you can chat a bit with grand-
ma prosser

  the four younger people played
at one table robert and diane
were allowed to partner each other
because after all they were across
the table and george milson settled
himself down comfortably opposite
lu grandma prosser pulled up a
chair and made remarks about the
hands she could see tiring of that
she returned to the subject of the
guest of honor

  manys the time young man
she told robert ive blessed your
mother for trying to make a pianist
out of you and dianes mother
too many an afternoons sleep
youve destroyed fumbling up and
down the scales

  robert brightened

  ive nothing much to show for
it he said but i remember well
enough diane used to sit at hers
musical pryposal



across the lot with our windows
open and wed see who could play
the loudest remember diane
her eyes flicked up from the cards
to nod to him

  well now said grandma pros-
ser well have to hear from you
both by and by youll have to
have them play for us agnes
robert and diane exchanged
quick glances of dismay after
bridge one might escape  but if the
evening was to drag on in the bosom
of the family it would be intoler-
able stephen trench from the door-
way saw that glance and writhed
inwardly he felt a sense of suf-
focation as if life had him down and
by the throat and went out into the
garden for a sniff of air the eve-
ning had grown cool and as he
looked a faint glow in the north be-
gan to grow and shift and change
green spears of light- moved across
the sky changing extending con-
tracting stephen returned to the
drawing room

  drop your cards a minute he
said urgently i want to show you
something hurry he thought
its working theyre coming
mrs trenchs voice was distinctly
cool

  what is it stephen a fire
oh just northern lights

  oh lovely sighed emily in the
voice she kept for occasions

  that last bid lu said george
why didnt you raise me i could
have taken two more tricks easy as
you please

  grandma prosser was staring with
dim eyes at the heavenly phenom-
enon once when i was a girl she
began but nobody was listening

  uncle albert was taking the op-
portunity to get a few puffs at a
cigar hed been aching for since
supper agnes allowed cigarettes
but not the heavier smoke

  well mrs trench spoke hur-
riedly im sure stephen you
meant well but our game-shall
we she suggested brightly get
back to it diamonds were trumps
werent they albert

  they began to troop in on the
terrace outside stephen saw with a
leaping heart two young people
moving not toward but away from
the door they were on the grass
barely distinguishable now still
gazing up at the mysterious lights
of the north stephens own gaze
traveled up to them again they
stirred in him an excitement as if
he like gratidma prosser were see-
ing them again with young eyes
he remembered lying in a canoe for
a long summer night facing upward
with eleanor silently watching
now he watched the two figures on
the grass their heads almost touch-
ing their profiles clear and eloquent
in the lovely glow from the sky
stephen

  yes dear

  where are they

 who

  dont be stupid robert and
diane of course

  he summoned his wits to tem-
porize only seconds had- passed

  oh there they are said mrs
trench he saw her go heavily de-
cisively across the grass

 my dear diane have you for-
gotten our guests robert im
sorry-but do you mind its quite
chilly and diane is so susceptible
stephen withdrawing a little so
that his face should not be seen
watched them return nothing had
happened nothing could have
been said in those short instants
dianes delicately tinted face was
pale and her luminous eyes showed
distress robert looked politely im-
passive as he followed his hostess in-
doors eor a brief moment his
 

street  smiths love story magazine

hand brushed against dianes
their fingers interlocked behind
mrs trenchs back and then
swiftly- untangled themselves

  mrs trench summoned re-
freshments early robert must
take the eleven-thirty train
and there -was the music to
come

  robert and i will serve
mother

  no dear ive asked ethel
to wait up robert may pass
the napkins if you will
robert theyre right behind
you	

  stephen trench returned to his
guests moodily helpless revolt
within him a vast scorn for himself
raging he glanced at his watch
it was nearly eleven in a short

on the terrace outside stephen saw with a
leaping hearty two young people together
they were robert said diane

     youngsters could only escape after
     the ice cream

    but mrs trench was watching
    that

our time is so short she said

time how robert must go if the taking roberts empty plate we
musical proposal



must have the music weve promised
grandma prosser do oblige us
robert

  chopin mozart liszt stole into
the room enticed by roberts
fingers diane sat near by her face
pale her eyes misty

  the boy can play thought
stephen its not making it any
easier lor her

  then robert turned grandma
prosser will hardly remember my
playing like that he smiled
wasnt it more like this grand-
ma

  lie swung into a curious rambling
improvisation one motif only re-
peated with a fierce monotony then
ended with a thumping chord
then helooked at diane

  your turn he said

  a flush ran deep and red in
dianes face her eyes seemed sud-
denly bright and alive as if the
music had awakened her she
sprang up lightly seated herself and
a crystal cascade of notes moved
under her fingers she hadnt
robert pennels technique and
power but this was fairy music
abandoned gay irrepressible it
moved and shifted bright and ex-
citing thought stephen trench as
the dawn then the music ccased
diane turned-to grandma prosser

  and this she said is niore the
kind of thing you had to put up
with from me grandma

  with childlike thumping notes
she gave her imitation con-
scientiously fingering then with a
glance at robert swung into a song

      on the road to mandalay
      where the flying fishes play-

  uncle albert then stood beside
the piano singing it in a surprising
tenor and stephen trench at first
with diffidence then more con-
fidently stepped up and supplied

the bass the fingers of the girl
seemed bewitched

  mrs trench caught her husbands
arm

  stephen the car get it out
robert will be late she was a
little pale and distraught as if an
atmosphere alien and frightening
had caught her unawares he
obeyed the scent of flowers and
of gasoline mingled and the night
seemed full of unanalyzed things
he drove the car around to the front
door seeing them all on the porch
grandma prosser a little bent with
her rheumatism george with his
arm linked companionably in lus
uncle albert puffing a cigar emily
contributing a languid smile and
mrs prosser an eager one agnes
trench dominating and repulsing
one more ambition for diane

  no darling-you cant go to the
station uncle albert will go with
father wont you albert well
play some anagrams until you get
back and then everybody can take
a hand good-by robert good
luck

  robert was shaking hands all
around then he was facing diane

  good-by diane his eyes were
intense his voice husky

  robert-oh robert

  she filing herself into his arms
kissiug him

  oblivious of the audience he
strained her to him and kissed her
lips tenderly

  my darling he murmured in a
voice as poignantly melodiousas his
music

  diane mrs trenchs gasp
penetrated the air

  the night seemed to hold its
breath at this shocking abandon
certainly the group on the porch
did diane drew herself from this
public embrace and swung around
to her mother


street  smiths love story magazine

  but mother  were engaged
ive promised to marry robert ive
promised to go out when he sends
for me

  come robert said uncle al-
bert suddenly practical or youll
miss the train

  robert pennel did not move

  its true he told mrs trench
soberly im sorry if it seems so-
so sudden	-

  then he kissed diane again-a
long clinging kiss-and was in the
car stephen trench drove as if
possessed the train was caught by
inches but he squeezed roberts
hand in a final message

  could you drive a bit slower
asked uncle albert on the way
back id like to finish this cigar
he chuckled suddenly bless
youth he ejaculated love will
find a way old top

  stephen trench said nothing his
sharp satisfaction was tempered by
the knowledge that he had yet his
wife to face the guests as he had
supposed were gone the anagrams
forgotten good nights said with
false gayety stephen hearing
raised voices quickened his steps
diane was facing her mother and
aunt in the room littered with rem-
nants of a dead party

  oh mother how could you
you tried you schemed just to keep
us from those last few hours
werent you ever young dont
you understand dianes young
tones were ringing out passionately

  she broke off at sight of her
father in the doorway stephen put
his arm aboutn her waist silently
mrs trench saw father and daugh-
ter clinging together facing her de-
fiantly but it remained for aunt
emily to make the capitulation for

her sister its probably all for the
best agnes

  for the best repeated mrs
trench slowly she looked baffled
beaten then a faint gleam appeared
in her eyes

  well she said decisively rising
there is one thing i should like to
know diane when please did this
mad proposal take place

  diane went swiftly to her mothers
side	

  mother youre going to be nice
about it arent you  im so happy
and i do want you to see its for the
best like aunt emily says

 but when diane how-

  diane looked suddenly radiant
it  was grandma prossers
music she laughed joyously
when robert and i were kids we
used to play to each- other across
the lot with the windows open we
made up a code so that we could
talk to each other

  from the open window came the
unmistakable smell of uncle alberts
cigar and an equally unmistakable
chuckle

  proposal by music said uncle
albert in the bosom of the
family well well

  mrs trench sat down suddenly
in the nearest chair

  stephen dear she said shakily
will you please fetch me a glass of
water

  beaten as she was she looked
once more at- dianes radiant face
her sparkling eyes and her defeat
was complete she held out a hand
to the girl

  ive heardsome people say that
the east is a romantic place she
was admitting reluctantly as
stephen returned with the glass of
water
your week

ise and a genera feeling of optimism can

ing this is the best week generally we

th

tion with any degree of
thought it should be a satis-
factory business and personal
day and you can expect to
have a light and enjoyable
evening the main idea about
to-day is that it brings mat-
ters to a climax do not
waste your hours because to-
morrow inaugurates a new cy-
clc and you must be ready
for it

there is a new moon at 
a m which begins the new
cycle mentioned yesterday
the morning hours are har-
monious and pleasant but
business is in order until noon
it is a most efficient day and
evening and you will be able
to accomplish much even
though the slight emotional
problems and the pressure of
circumstances are upsetting
and disturbing to sour poise
keep going be busy and
utilize all your talents

the waking hours are emo-
tional and there will be do-
mestic problems to handle
exciting circumstances can be
expected until noon stay on
the job and avoid rashness
and impulsiveness consider
no idea which is not in keep-
ing with your program and
treat the superficial happen-
ings this morning as tem-
porary factors in your life
the afternoon hours are pleas-
ant and good for social rela-
tions the evening hours
bring the inclination toward
recreation and enjoyment and
the general trend is favorable

affairs which were  started
earlier in the week will en-
gage your attention to-day
but you- will not be able to do
justice to your efficient ideas
there is too much emotion
and feeling indicated in the
planetary conditions and you
will have to postpone vital
matters until later

if you were born between

   miss e m p born july - con-
 necticut  a m astrology can tell
 you only the planetary conditions and how
 you will be inclined the will to do and
 how you take advantage of opportunities is
 up to you i can see from your chart that
 it is difficult for you to make definite de-
 cisions and act upon your ideas you have
 the capacity to do great things with your-
 self but i believe your uncertain tempera-
your stars and you



 ment vacillation and sensitivity are handi-
 caps  you are intelligent energetic and
 have good basic judgment now you have -
 the cooperation of the planets for the next
 two years you should make changes and
 accept opportunities the first of which will
 probably come your way in the early
 spring act with more confidence seek
 opportunities expand your personality
 and make new contacts conditions in
 your home will not be entirely satisfactory
 but that should be a separate part of your
 existence which has nothing to do with
 your material advancement be wise and
 progressive

  star dust born february  
maine  p m sorry but i do not
omit birth dates except in unusual cases
your chart does not correspond with that
of the man you mention and i advise a
permanent break there is a lack of sym-
pathy between you and there is no doubt
but that you will find some one who will
appeal to you more than the current heart
interest there is a definite break coming
shortly anyway and changes in many
directions i do not advise you to become
serious with any one of the opposite sex
for about three years-meaning marriage
of course do not forget there is a time
and place for everything under the sun
write to me again

  miss m l l born march   in-
diana  a m it appears very likely
to me that marriage is in store for you
folks late this summer the two charts
harmonize and you have much in common
affairs in general will improve for both of
you and even though the economic problem
injects itself and you think there should
be a postponement i advise you to pro-
ceed with your plans if possible

  mr c f w born january  
ohio about  a m there is no doubt
about your having artistic talent but i am
sorry that you spent your money on a
correspondence course i feel as if you
should have had the benefit of class work
and a personal teacher it so happens that
i rccall the marvelous art institution in
your town and i advise you to consult an
expert make ho change in your plans be-
cause i feel you have a future in the com-
mercial field also you have just finished
a bad planetary period and i am sure you
will find more encouragement in future
conditions it will be necessary for you
to stay where you are for the present but

you will have a change the latter pat of
the year	-

  mrs a b born february  
arkansas  a m it was kind of you
to write me again and i am sorry your
reply has been delayed before i answer
your question i wish to urge you to con-
tinue your astrological studies you will
find it helpful in many ways and your
chart is well adapted to it there is no
question in my mind about your instinctive
healing ability and inherent knowledge of
medicine it is too bad you were not able
to study this in your early life and i am
wondering if it would be possible for you
to obtain work of an apprenticeship or
assisting nature in a clinic or institution
your intuition is remarkable and you can-
not help from pouring forth your strength
and giving yourself to each and every case
i would like to see you do something with
this unusual talent you have been re-
lieved of great pressure in your life which
has continued in one form or another for
about eight years and now is the time for
you to make a concentrated effort to im-
prove your circumstances any changes in
the immediate future will be beneficial
do not hesitate to associate yourself with
some one else who is established i believe
this is your best way of becoming better
known

  mrs e b son born january  
pennsylvania  p m i answered you
previously about your daughter but have
just discovered your second letter about
your son the answer to your inquiry
anput his talent is in the affirmative you
are fortunate in haying such capable
talented children proceed with your plans
for them

  mr w k born january   wis-
consin  p m it has been impossible
for me to answer your letter before now
and i am sorry for the delay due to the
improved planetary conditions you have
had since last fall i am inclined to think
you have obtained tangible results it is
difficult for me to tell you specifically
about this examination because even
though your chart indicates improvement
and fresh opportunities i do not know just
how your own willingness to benefit by
them has been demonstrated however i
want to say that i like your chart you
have balance a good mind that likes to
go to the root of matters and your per-
sistent qualities are very strong you have


street  smiths love story magazine

 been operating under limiting influences
 since  which became critical in 
 and  most of that restriction and
 pressure from the planetary rays has been
 lifted and you can expect steady improve-
 ment in the future it is a question of
 building a new foundation for yourself so
 allow no opportunity to escape and make
 every effort to place yourself solidly you
 will have to work hard and assume respon-
 sibility- but i believe you will be satisfied
 with results best wishes

    mrs jb born may   place not
 stated  p m the circumstances be-
 tween yourself and the man you mention
 in your letter are clearly indicated in the
 two charts there is an attraction but i
 cannot see you feeling anything for him
 which is deep and permanent neverthe-
  less there is another marriage in your life
 i think you will marry some one later
 whom you will like very much-probably
  in  do not be hasty about under-
 taking the responsibility of his family com-
 bined with your own i believe you would
 regret it

 	nora born december  
 michigan  a m it was kind of you
 to write me such a pleasant and frank
 letter i can see from your chart that you
 have not had an easy time of it but whom
 do you know who has not -had his troubles
 in the past few years i can promise you
 improved conditions this year and in 
 even though they will not live up entirely
 to your expectations i hardly know how
 to answer you about this man you men-
 tion there is a strong bond between you
 and yet your natures are very opposite in
 many ways you have your impulsive
 moments but fundamentally you like
 security quiet and stability and i see noth-
 ing in this mans chart which would guar-
 antee security he is clever and intelligent
  but does not have the constancy that you-
 do frankly i do not advise anything of
 a permanent nature but feel you would
 make fine friends

ing it is fine- that you have started her
education along these lines so early in life
in mentioning her emotional equipment
and her bursts of temperament i would
say these will increase as she becomes older
her chart also shows the ability to imitate
and an inherent sense of showmanship all
of these qualities will assist her in the

tunities-during the next three years to ex-

department conducted by

laura alston brown

w ell-known authority on love and marriage

     mrsbrown will be glad to solve in these pages problems on which you desire
advice your letters will be regarded confidentially and signatures will be withheld

     although mrs brown receives more letters than she can possibly print in the
department she answers all the others by mail so lay your problem before her
with the knowledge that it will have her full attention

      address mrs laura alston brown street  smiths- love story magazine
 seventh avenue new york n y

 there are many likable young
 young men with adequate
 incomes who could take
 romance seriously and make the
 girl they marry happy but it
 would seem that these light-hearted
 young men prefer the flashy type of
 girl and apparently ignore the
 liome-loving quiet girl who would
 make an ideal wife

   a girl would have to have plenty
 of courage to marry aman who con-
 siders existence a giddy round of
 good times and who does not realize
 that life and love have a finer
 deeper meaning far more important
 than any light-hearted gayeties of
 the moment

   roberta is in love with one of
 these flighty young men and won-
 ders whether any girl has a chance
 to be happy with a playboy

dear mrs brown i am a girl of
twenty-one- well educated and although
 my father has a good business i have a
job as assistant to an interior decorator
i like to be busy and feel a little useful

 	i am considered fairly good-looking en-
 joy good times sports and have many
 friends i suppose i ought to be quite

 happy but the truth is that i am miser-
 able

   you see im in love with a young man
 of twenty-five who is of the irresponsible
 playboy type he comes from a good
 family has always had enough money to
 do ashe liked and is quite handsome

   like many young men of his type he is
 never serious the more girl friends he
  dates the merrier most of them are giddy
 flappers who should know better than to
 fritter their time away on a young fellow
 who will never offer them marriage

   about five months ago he went on a wild
 ride in his car there were three fellows
 and four girls in the party evidently they
 had had too much liquid cheer and they
 had a smashed car before they knew it
 fortunately no one was seriously hurt
 since then phil has quieted down some-
 what and promised to really behave-

    we have been dating steady twice a
 week for about two months my parents
 like him a lot and as- for me-im des-
 perately in love with him but how can a
 girl trust a boy like that and if mar-
 riage does come along would he stay put
 its hard for me to believe that an easy-
 going lively young man like phil is likely
 to really settledown

   i have often entertained the thought that
 as soon as this last escapade of his is for-
 gotten he will start chasing other girls
 again do you think i could trust him
 to be true to me

   i wonder if other readers have had a

i 
the friend in need



problem like mine and if so i would
more than appreciate it if they would
write in and tell ine what they would do
ift-hey were in my place

  phil has asked me to marry him at the
end of the year but as yet i have not
promised because i think it will do him
good to be kept guessing we are wonder-
ful friends and get along fine my par-
ents say its up to me	roberta

 when it comes to marriage my
dear one can never actually predict
what the future will bring how-
ever a girl can tell fairly well what
stuff the young man is made of from
close association with him and his
family

 many a young man with plenty
of spending money and very little
restraint is apt to go in for more
freedom than is good for him but
it is not proof that he can never
settle down and make a dependable
husband on the other hand there
are young men who are apparently
unable to take life- and love seri-
ously they are always in a rush
and think they are having a wonder-
ful time although the fact is that
they seldom find real happiness

  if you and phil really love each
other you might give him the bene-
fit of the doubt and a year or so in
which to prove that he means to
keep his word about settling down
by the end of that time you should
be reasonably sure whether phil has
a wabbly backbone or if he can be
relied upon

  dear mrs brown i am a girl of
eighteen and have been going with a young
man for almost two years he tells me
that he cares for me deeply- and always in-
sists on talking about the things we will do
after we are married

  however i cannot say that i care for -
him in any other- way except as a friend

i have thought of married life with him
and find that i would not be at all happy

i know i can never learn tolove him 

  i have tried many times to break with
him but he always puts me off saying
that a girl of eighteen is too young to

know what she wants and that i would be
sorry if i ever broke with him	-

   blit i dont think he  is right i know
that if i were in love with him i would
be happy when we are together

  perhaps you will think i am young anjl
silly but this boy and i are so different
from each other he has lived in the city
only about five years and doesnt like it
much he sees absolutely no sense in
dancing parties and other ways of enjoy-
ing oneself it seems i like all the things
he doesnt care for

  please advise me what to do dont you
think i should drop him and have a chance
to meet other young men and find a boy
i could love	alicia

  you may be young dear but
hardly silly it is easy to -under-
stand that any young man in love
would not like the idea of giving up
the girl in question but surely he
cannot beso blind as to refuse to
realize that one-sided loves bring
only unhappiness and that sooner
or later a break is inevitable

  im sure we sympathize with
him but at the same time it seems
pointless on his part to try to force
himself upon you when the whole
thing causes you so much distress
try again and this time be more
firm tell him kindly but definitely
that you are sure you cannot return
his affection and that it would be
for his own good for you to part if
he should wish to see you sometimes
as a friend it will be up to him

  dear mrs brown i am twenty years
old i married a little over two years ago
my husband is not quite three years older
than i during the time we were going
together we never went many places since
we have been married it is more or less
the same way	

  sometimes one would think my husband
was forty the way he wants to stay home
nights sunday is about the only day we
go anywhere 

-	my husband doesnt care for shows danc-
ing or any kind of sports except hunting

i never go with him then because he al-
ways takes a group of men along

   i enjoy shows dancing and all kinds of
sports especially swimming and horseback


street tfe smiths love story magazine

riding my husband seems to think these
things are rather foolish though i dont
see why i knew before we were married
that he cared very little for the things i
like but hardly thought about it

  then there is another problem which i
have tried to combat if we are out riding 
with another couple and are having a good
time it generally ends up with my hus-
baiids getting drunk and spoiling what lit-
tle fun i manage to have i have tried
drinking with him thinking maybe he
wouldnt drink so much butit only made
matters worse

  he makes a good salary and we have a
car we could afford to have a good time
together and be fine companions if he would
only be more agreeable i love him dearly
and he is as good to me as any husband
can be in other ways than those i men-
tioned	

mrs brown is there any way i could
get him to take me out more and enjoy
the things i do i have tried everything
i know even to talking it over with him
but it doesnt seem to do any good i
know he loves me but i dont understand
why hecant quit drinking and be a real
companion

  i will appreciate any suggestion  you
make	unhappy wife 

  being married to a man who does
not care for any of the simple
pleasures his wife enjoys would be
hard on any woman it would seem
only logical to suppose that if your
husband loves you and knows his
drinking makes you so unhappy an
appeal to the affectionate side of his 
nature would encourage him to be
more moderate

  to be fair of course you must
consider the fact that he is good to
you in other ways as you say
wouldnt it be possible for you to
enjoy with a girl friend some of the
sports you like and although your 
husband dislikes dancing it ought
notto be difficult for you to arrange
informal parties at your home every
now and then and dance to your
hearts content

  every husband should make an
effort to join in at least some of the
social activities his wife enjoys if

the marriage is to be a happy one
husbands should avoid making it 
necessary for their wives to coax and
flatter them into doing things-

  dear mrs brown when i was fifteen 
years old i was obliged to plan my wed-
ding rather hurriedly my husband was
five years older than i but we were very
much in love with each other

  my mother was dead and until i got
married i kept house for my father how-
ever my husbands parents wanted us to
live with them and although i didnt want
to i gave in at that time my mother-in-
law was running a rooming house

  before i was married my husbands
mother seemed to like me and wanted me
to go with her son against my fathers
wishes like a foolish child i didnt listen
to him

  after i was married my mother-in-law
treated me very well but when my baby
was two  months old she changed she
couldnt be mean enough she wanted to
show me what to do and what not to do
about the baby saying l was too young
to know anything

  then she started nagging me constantly
insulted me in front of friends and even
told the girls who helped her with the
housework to flirt with my husband to
make me jealous every time she got my
husband alone shed tell him  all sorts of
lies about me

  we lived with her for three years and
then my husband and i moved away
sometime afterward a friend of mine told
me that before i married my husband got
one of his mothers hired girls into trouble
and that there was a child

  i knew this girl because she was still
with my mother-in-law when i got mar-
ried i asked my husband about this and
he said it was all a lie and that he knew
nothing about it my mother-in-law just
laughed and said somebody was trying to
make trouble by telling lies

  last christmas however i found a letter
belonging to my mother-in-law it was
from that girl and she talked about her
child in such a way that i knew my hus-
band was the father

  when my husband came home i showed
him the letter and he owned up andsaid
it was true but he said he never loved
this girl and didnt want me to find out
the truth he also said he couldnt pre-
vent his folks going to see this girl and
the baby
 the friend in need



    the next time my mother-in-law came
  to ace me i told her just what i thought of
  her i forbade my two children to go near
  her as she used to take them to her house
  andtalk to them about me i told her

-	never to step inside my door again

    i tried to be her friend but she didnt
  want me so i made up my mind not to
  care for her company she doesnt seem to
  know what friendship is anyway she has
  caused me only heartache ever since ive
  known her

    as for my husband he does not drink
  or smoke and is trying to be a man he
  tells me that he loves me and that he had
  never really loved any other girl before but
  i dont feel the same toward him

    i used to think there was no other man
  like him until i found this out lam only
  twenty-four now and i hate to think that
  my marriage is spoiled

    do you think i did right to refuse my
  mother-in-law to see my children every
  time she came she was looking for an argu-
  ment and meddling in my affairs

miserable bertha

   whenever anything happens to
 disillusion us about some one we
 love life and love never seem quite
 the same but it does not mean
 that we must give up hope of ever
 finding a measure of happiness

    it is indeed regrettable when in-
  laws do not give two young people
  a free hand in working out their own
  marriage problems sometimes in-
  laws try to be helpful but their de-
  sire to help seems to turn into
  defeat and sooner or later other
  elements creep into a relationship
  that might otherwise have remained
  tolerable

   while it was not commendable on
  your husbands part to have evaded
  the responsibility of his former
  romance the fact that it all hap-
  pened before you met and married

  	him should enable you to stay and
  give him another chance for your
  childrens sakes

   no matter what the past may
 have been if a man tries to play
 fair he deserves an opportunity to
 prove that he is sincere

 dear mrs brown i am desperately
in need of a friends advice and as i have
no mother to turn to i hope you will help
me

  i cant remember any real happiness in
life until a short while ago i am twenty
at sixteen i married not for love but to
be independent but my marriage lasted
only three months and then i was a
divorcee

  a year later i married again but i only 
spent seven dreadfully unhappy months
with a man any woman could have it
ended up by his beating me to the extent
of putting me in the hospital where i
stayed for almost four months of course

i sued for divorce when i got out

  by this time i was heartsick disap-
pointed and life seemed a failure how-
ever three months after my second divorce
i met an old school chum of mine and a
week later we were married

  for six weeks we were divinely happy
then i was rushed to the hospital for an
emergency operation while i was ill my
husband met a woman let her drive my
car and gave her a valuable diamond ring
that belonged to me

  several weeks after i came home i caught
them in my car however i wanted to
make a success of the marriage and did
not try to cause trouble a month later
my husband took the money i had to pay
the hospital bill my grandfather had
given me this money as my husband was
out of work i later found out hed lost
his job because he had stolen money where
he worked once more i was granted a
divorce

  for the past eight months i have lived
alone without faith in the future have i
been the cause of alt my failures i hardly
think so

  here is my present problem just be-
fore christmas i met a very charming cliap
hes only a year older than i we were
constantly together for ten days then he
returned to his job in another city i
visited him for five days and have just re-
turned however my mind is in a turmoil

  i am deeply in love for the first time
and have dropped all other friends since i
first met this man but he has heard con-
siderable talk about my past theres al-
ways some one to make my story a bigger
one than it really is now he is very sus-
picious and jealous of me

  he has told me he could really love me
if he dared but he doesnt want to be
hurt and he doesnt completely trust me

  if he only knew the heartaches and un-


street  smiths love story magazine

happiness i have been through since i was
sixteen hed know id never hurt any one
regardless of how little they meant to me
least of all the man who has made me
want to make something of myself

  he has given me a new hope yet ha
breaks it down at times with an outburst
of uncontrollable temper although he
hurts me very deeply i love him so ter-
ribly much i-forgive him immediately

  how can i explain my unhappy past to
him in such a way that he will be con-
vinced i am really in love with him and
that i am willing to live on what lie can
offer me

 we have decided to wait but i cant
stand this separation and his doubts when
we are apart i am true to him and have
no thought for any other man

   wont you please try to help a girl who
thinks she has had more than her share of

	hard knocks 	ermine

  it is hard to understand why it
should take any effort at all to con-
vince your friend that you are really
in love with him surely having
been married and divorced more
than once in search of happiness
should not be held against you

  i would suggest that you resume
your former friendships or make
new friends and do not cut your-
self off from the companionship of
other people it is always a mis-
take for any woman to drop every
one simply because she has at last
met the one man

  perhaps if your friend could not
feel so sure of you he would be less
indifferent there is no necessity
for you to apologize to him for your
previous marriages if he really
loves you the past shouldnt matter

  dear mrs brown this is an answer
to socrates who has such ai biased opinion 
of girls i hope you will find room to
print it as it is meant for blue barney
too

   the things id like to say to you soc-
rates wouldnt look at all well on paper
buf of all the conceited borieheads you
take the prize who do you think you are 
giving out an opinion likethat of all girls
just because you have met a couple who are
out for a good time and nothing else

  there are plenty of girls who dont go
in for petting and drinking- at all and
those who go in for excessive drinking and
smoking are very much in the minority if
you had- sense enough to look in thefight
places youd find your ideal of course-
you wont find her at the wild parties you
speak of cheap taverns and places of
questionable reputation how could you
certainly no girl who has any self-respect
is going to be found in such places

  and there are very few girls whom you
will find sitting at home by the fire knitting
socks for grandpa all girls want to have
a good time naturally but not the way
you seem to think they do there is much
enjoyment in taking long walks through the
country going to movies and dances - and
even sitting at home nights with a fellow
who enjoys a friendly conversation

  personally i think boys are to be blamed
for what some girls are boys dont care
a hang about a girl as long as they have a
good tiifte if a boy takes a girl out and
she doesnt consent to go to some dark spot
to park and submit to his kissing and maul-
ing she is considered a flat tire frankly

i prefer being called a flattire

   -	with ideas like yours youre nothing less
than a simpleton i could write a lot more
in this letter but i want it to be published

       a connecticut stenographer

  after reading a- letter like the
above there seems to be little doubt
that some young men get oft on the
wrong foot because of their egotism
necking and petting may have been-
yesterdays fun but girls of to-day
possess a goodly amount of common
sense and the determination to stick
to high ideals in spite of the fact
that they are going places and do-
ing things

  and heres another

  dear mrs brown if i were as narrow-
minded as socrates and lue barney i
might make an equally vicious statement
about the conduct ofmost men however
living in a big city has made me broadr
minded enough to know that there are as
decent men and women to-day as in our
mothers days i say that sincerely al-
though ive seen some very poor examples

  i am a girl of twenty and live in chi-
cago i am considered verv good-looking
and have a pleasing personality i am also
sensible and practical but i must com-
the friend in need



fess that i have had my share of unwelcome
attentions from men who should have
known better

    im a high-school graduate and because
  of poor business conditions i lost my job
 as secretary and had to takethe first job
 that came along that was as waitress
 beyond city limits in a so-called respectable
 tavern

   in comparison to my previous knowledge
 of life i learned the cruder facts of human
 nature the people i met were of the
 wrong kind and i soon became disillu-
 sioned i distrusted all men

   i lost faith so completely that when
 friends called to take me out i preferred
 to stay home and read

    fortunately i told my troubles to an old
 friend he said i had no- reason to feel
 that way because i was merely an on-
 looker while those fools openly petted in
 smoke-filled rooms and drank bad whisky

    he advised me to get a job in a different
  place pick my friends more carefully and
  especially stop being alone so much and
  avoiding all men friends 

    i followed his advice at first i found
 that all boys expected you to smoke drink
 and neck until all hours

   however i discarded those friends and
 tried to find others

   right now my ideals are normal again
 i have met many decent young men and
 have many good times without cause for
 complaint

    my advice to socrates is to stop being a
 crab and look for friends elsewhere if he
 is really as nice a young man as he says
 it shouldnt be hard for him to meet nice
 people and interest himself in some equally
 nice girl

    i know that from now on i will continue
 to look for a man who comes up to my
 standards and i hope i have the patience
 because ive met many poor examples
 when i have no place to go- i sew or
 knit and try my hand at the things that
 make a girl a successful housekeeper

    girls do you think its foolish of me to
   wait and hope that some diay i will find the
  right man id like to hear from any one
  who reads this letter i really think there
  are many good men left am i wrong

 babs

   i am sure you are not wrong in
 your belief that there are many good
 men left and i agree with you
 that it isnt fair to judge every one
 by the shortcomings of a few per-

 haps after reading these two letters
 socrates and blue barney will take
 time to think things over

 however here is a young man
who agrees with socrates that nice
girls are almost nonexistent

 dear mrs brown i dont know
whether this letter will ever find its way
into print but after reading socratess
letter i would certainly like to shake hands
with a real man

  i agree with him that girls these days are
nothing but playthings who revel in pet-
ting and kisses drink paint and smoke like
a chimney none of them have any com-
mon sense every girl i have ever dated
drank smoked and having a good time was
her special interest if she met a fellow
who could spend more on her than her cur-
rent boy friend all the better and the old
friend was given the well-known air with-
out so much as a thank you

  socrates said that if a fellow isnt what
the girls call a good sport and if he doesnt
join in drinking like the others he is seldom
asked anywhere - his deductions are cer-
tainly correct 

  i dont care for liquor i could never see
what fun people could have when they
were tight and couldnt see straight as for
easy kisses theres no glamour when a girl
kisses every fellow who takes her out but
that seems to be what the girls want

  girls also complain that boys get fresh
and forget to behave like gentlemen girls
may complain but they fall for a fellow
just the same if only to add another scalp
to their list

  maybe youll say i feel this way because
i havent met the only girl ive met lots
of girls but couldnt fall in love with any of
them because i saw nothing to fall in love
with i really dont believe there are any
honest-to-goodness girls and the boys i
know think the same

  im twenty-three have had two years of
college and am now working in a con-
tractors office im considered good-look-
ing and have been told i have a likable
personality - so i dont think that the rea-
son i havent found the right girl is be-
cause im not presentable

  another thing that jars me is that girls
lack loyalty they are pals when a fellow
can take them places but when hes broke
-well thats his hard luck and they openly
admit there are plenty of other fellows who
dont have to economize

  i have heard of only one ease where the


street  smiths love story magazine

girl remained engaged to the fellow after -
hed lost his job and had to get on his feet
again call that loyalty when a girl cant
stick to a man- because hes down

  so there you are girls youre always
complaining about the boys but im at a
loss as to how a fellow can find a decent
girl a girl who has one or two old-fashioned
ideas left and who would really be inter-
ested in home-making rather than all-night
parties	busbee

  i believe ill just sit back and let
you girls tell busbee how he may
find his hearts desire how about
it family

  dear mbs brown perhaps my prob-
lem may seem trivial to you but i would
like to have your advice our home was
broken up by divorce and i went to live
with my father until two years ago when
i went to stay with my mother

  since the divorce mother has been very
bitter and now she doesnt want me to go
out with any boy who is at all serious about
me there is one boy four years my senior

i am twenty he says he loves me and- i
am sure i love him but mother thinks i
couldnt be happy with him because he is
too quiet  he doesnt care for dances
parties or even card games but i dont
really mind

  i was in love once before but the boy
disappointed me terribly and now i cant
seem to trust this young man as i probably
should when he tells me how much he cares

  sometimes i imagine that it wont last
or that he will- get tired of me however
at othertimes ithinkhe is old enough to
know his own mind he had had other girl
friends before i started going with him

  he wants me to marry him at the end
of the year but i really dont see how
i can marry him feeling-as i do besides
my mother wants me to go out with other
boys and forget him she thinks we are
not well enough suited to each other

  of course i dont want to break with
him pp-you think we could be happy to-
gether if we couldnt then i might as
well give him up now instead of letting him
think that ill marry him

 unceutain marion

  there is only one thing to do  if
you are not certain of your feelings
for this boy and that is not to think
of anything as serious as marriage
at least not now

  no doubt your mother means
well and understanding life so
much better than you do dear she
is probably right in saying that if
you and this boy have such dif-s
ferent likes and dislikes there would
be friction however just because
your mothers marriage ended so un-
happily it does not mean that yours
will not work out

  give yourself more time to think
it over and dont hesitate to have
other friends if you can make your
friend understand that you want to
be fair and have his happiness at
heart as much as your own he may
not resent the fact that you are so
undecided

 dear mrs brown for the past sis
months i have been in love with a girl
who lives in the same house i have been
out with her quite a lot and have told her-
i am in love with her however although
she likes me and likes to go out with me
she tells me frankly that she is not inlove
with me

   im quite heartbroken about the whole
 thing although she says she doesnt love-
 me she leads me to think that she does
 her father doesnt like me becausei have
 a quick temper and i cant go to this
 girls home as we live in the same house
 however its easy for us to see each other

   i am twenty-one and she is sixteen
 shes  a fine seiisible girl and always the
 life of- the party when we are out to-
 gether i know i - can never love another
 girl as i love her and -ij doubt whether
 i can be happy without her she seems
 to be quite grown up

   she admits she is fond of me but that
 it isnt love and has suggested that we
 wait two or three years to see how things
 turn out do you think that would be a
 good idea im afraid tlial if we wait
 she may fall for some other fellow later on
 should i ask her not to go with other-
 boys	-

   wont you please advise me and tell me
 what you think would be best for us to
 do i know i will never be really happy
 unless she marries me willy of ohio

  i can well understand how dis-
couraged you feel but where love
and marriage are concerned it is
the friend in need



 only natural for a girl to hesitate
 when she is in doubt about her own
 feelings 

  however you need not lose all
 hope that this girl will ever consider
you seriously and waiting two or
three years is as sound and sensible
a suggestion as any one could offer
in a problem of this kind by the
end of that time you will both know
how you stand in each others re-
gard	

   but holding a girl back from other
friendships would show selfishness
on your part my boy and it would
not prevent her from falling in love
with some one else if jou two de-
cide to wait im sure you will find
that a girl seldom turns down a
young man who proves himself a
generous sympathetic and devoted
friend

  dear mrs brown a year ago i met
a lioy who was a night-club entertainer i
cant say it was love at first sight because
he seemed too much of a flirt he knew
my sister and her husband and he came
to our table for a drink

  ronny and i had a friendly chat and
before we left lie said he would like to
know me better i told him i lived in an-
other town and that i was going home in a
couple of days and although he- coaxed
me i refused to give him my address in
spite of the fact that i knew he could
easily get it from either my sister or
brother-in-law

  two weeks later my sister and her hus-
band came to see us and i had the sur-
prise of my life when i saw ronny with
them he stayed more than a week and
before he left we announced our engage-
ment

  he wrote to me every day and i was
the happiest girl in the world until i dis-
covered that i was to become a mother
all my castles tumbled i wrrote to ronny
and said we ought to be married at once
but lie didnt even answer my letter  i

nws

six

 ail nw stands 


street  smiths love story magazine

almost lost my mind when i realized that
all my love was just a passing fancy to
him	 

  of course i couldnt let my folks know
what had happened so-i went to stay with
my sister she lived in the same town as
ronnys mother and his older brother
murray my sister said i ought to tell
ronnys mother how he had treated me
but i couldnt do it especially as i really
liked her she is a fine woman

  ronnys mother and i talked about the
engagement but i didnt have the heart
to tell her that i no longer heard from
ronny or that he was responsible for mak-
ing my life so miserable she wanted me
to come to see her often

  the next time i went to see her i met
ronnys brother murray we talked
about different things including my com-
ing marriage to ronny on the way home
murray told me that he knew why i was
so blue because the last time he saw
ronny he heard the whole miserable story
he said that ronny didnt want to marry
me or any girl because it would spoil his
career

  i cant tell you how that hurt me i
sent back ronnys ring and said he could
go right ahead with his career and that
we were through for good

  i	met murray again and he was yerv
sweet -he wanted to come to see me- and
take me out and i was glad to- have a
friend- we- became good friends

  one day i was cleaning house and fell
from a ladder i had to go to the hospital
my baby was born dead when i realized
what had happened- all my- feeling for
ronny died too

  when i was well again murray began-
coming to see me regularly but i
couldnt stay with my sister forever and
when i told him that i was going home
soon he- took me ia his arms and asked
me to marry him

  i began to feel alive again murray was
very good to me and what girl doesnt
appreciate kindness when she -is in trouble

  however although i love murray more
than i ever loved ronny he said that lie
probably didnt have the right to ask me
to marry him since i was in love wm his
brother

  of course- when i- told him how- i felt
it was different but do you think that i
should- marry him knowing about ronny
and- me  do yon think he would throw
it up to me later on

   iib only nineteen and murray- is twenty-
five i- want to marry him and live hap-

pily but under the circumstances im
afraid to take such a serious step your
opinion will be greatly appreciated

                     downhearted

  there is no reason in the world
why you and murray couldnt be
happy together unless of course
you believe that he is the type of
man who might indulge in the un-
pleasant habit of bringing up the
past whenever something happened
to upset domestic peace knowing
him as well as you do you should
be able to determine this fact better
than any one else

  a man must be indeed generous
and understanding to really dis-
regard the past and be interested
only in the future many men ap-
pear to be unable to reach this point
of forgetfulness while there are
some who never stir the dead ashes
of the past

  why not give yourself a little
more time to study murray it is
better to take your time my dear
than to rush into a situation which
may bring you more grief if your
friend can close the door to the past
you two could probably be very
happy together

  dear mrs- brown about five years
ago i met a young man- and have been
in love with him ever since he has often
toldi me that he loves me better than any
one in the world

  my- parents however wouldnt allow- me
to go with him but i slipped out to
meet him whenever i could and they- never
knew he- is now twenty-five and i am
eighteen  my parents say i am not old
enough- to be- sure- hes the- right man for
me- to marry and they are sure he isnt

  ia order to please them i tried to be-
come interested in other boys but every
time i met jack id forget the  others
he seemed to feel the same way about
me and would beg me to stop going with-
other boys and go out with him only

   i usually did though we continued to- see
leach other secretly then some one told
my father that i was meeting jack and
he made me promise not to see him again

  i began keeping company with a cer-
the friend in need



tain boy in the neighborhood whom jack
asked me not to go with but i thought
that it would be a good way to forget him

   jack began going with another girl and
  drank more than ever he was in-the habit
  of drinking though not to excess that is
  one reason why my father objects to jack

    i continued going with this other boy
  bill for a few months then i met jack
  again and he begged me to drop bill
  loving jack as i did i agreed i tried to
  get my father to let me go with jack
  but he refused so again i had to give
  jack up

    time passed and though i still loved
  jack i was lonesome and blue i had to
  have some fun so dad let me go with bill
  but whenever i happened to meet jack
  he always begged me not to go out with
  any one else

    during all this time jack had only a
  few dates with other girls but he didnt
  stop drinking when i begged him to do
  so he said hed stop some day

    then i found a job away from home it
  gave me a chance to see jack often and
  we could go out without being watched
  we were very happy but some one tat-
  tled and my father told me that if i didnt
  quit seeing jack he would make me give
  up my job and come home

    jack was working at that time so we
  decided to get married then no one could
  separate us we even decided on the
  wedding date but as it drew nearer

  	jack heard that he was going to be laid
  off and as my job was not going to last
  much longer we thought that it would be
  better to wait until we were financially
  prepared for marriage

    he didnt stop drinking but kept prom-
  ising me that he would after we were mar-
  ried dad wouldnt agree for us to go
  together so jack said what good will it
  do me to quit drinking i love you so
  much that life isnt worth living without
  you

then i was laid off and went home
one night jack wasdrunk and did some-
thing that humiliated me terribly i de-
cided that he would never stop drinking
 and that i might just as well give him up

    we have not had a date for more than
  two months but i cant forget him i
  love him and i know ill never stop lov-
  ing him i have been out with bill again
  but there seems to be no solution to my
  problem

    the other day i saw jack again and he
  promised to stop drinking he said he
  hadnt had a drink for a week and tells

every one that he has stopped drinking
he wants me to make up and plan for us
to be together always

	what should i do if i marry him i
will break my parents hearts if i dont
my own heart will break i cant live
without him annette of michigan 

  no problem is so hopeless that it
cannot be worked out one way or
another but time and a strong de-
sire to iron out difficulties are neces-
sary in order to make the remedy
effective

  in the first place my dear if your
parents object to your going with
jack only because of his drinking
then it would seem reasonable to
suppose that if he loves you he
would be eager to give up liquor
and make every effort to convince
them he is worthy of your love

  why not tell your parents that you
would liketo give jack a year or so
to make good and that in the mean-
time you will have other friends
too that solution it seems to me
would be fair to every one con-
cerned it would give jack an
opportunity to turn over a new leaf
and show you he can be depended
upon

  a man who is really in love will
do everything within his power in
order to overcome obstacles  that
prevent him from marrying the girl
who has captured his heart

  dear mrs-brown i am a young sailor
of twenty-one and if you can give me some
advice i will certainly appreciate it 

  ever since i was sixteen i have found
a great deal of satisfaction in traveling and
being on the go i went to england
on a tramp steamer at that age and quit
when i was seventeen then i joined the
national guard for three years after that
i joined the navy and i enjoy it as long
as i can keep going 

  heres my problem i am in love with
a very sweet girl and would like to de-
vote the rest of my life to making her
happy however how can i settle down
to married life when i have no trade

  i am really and truly in love with this


street  smiths love story magazine

girl but it seems rather hard to make peo-
ple believe that a sailor can bea one-girl
man i still have a year and a half to
serve in the meantime we are both plan- 
ning for our future

  another thing that worries me is this
although i am in love and would like to
settle down at times i think i couldnt
be happy because i would no longer be
going places i suppose you will under-
stand and not be thumbs down onme

  i met this girl three years ago and
havent thought of any one else since she
says that when my time is up well be
married do you think we should even if
i have no job although we could fall back
on the little i have saved

  maybe this doesnt sound like a prob-
lem but i really have no one to ask for
advice and i feel sure you will offer some
suggestion i can follow

smiling sailor

  judging from your letter it seems
you have not shaken off the fascina-
tion of wanderlust enough to be
completely happy if you settled
down on the other hand if you
really love this girl as you say you
may be so happy that you will lose
all desire to be on the go

  the sensible and practical thing
to do after you leave service would
be to find what work you are best
adapted to and stick it out while
you are working you might be able
to take a night eourse in some trade
in which you are interested so that
you would be assured of a steady in-
come when you married

  give yourself more time my boy
and be frank with your girl friend
talk things over with her she will
not resent your taking her into your
full confidence

  dear mrs brown i met my husband
when i was eighteen and we were marr
ried shortly afterward for a little over a
year we were very happy then my hus-
band was transferred to another town but
instead of taking me with him he left me
at his mothers telling me he would send
for me as soon as he had found rooms

  but that very night he stopped at a
hotel and took a strange girl to a wild
party the next day he went to the town

where he was going to work and became
friendly with a woman he met they trav-
eled around together for two weeks he
never sent me a cent 	v

  then he came to see me and stayed
three days i was an expectant mother at v
the time he said he couldnt find rooms
and that was why he didnt send for me
although later i found out about this other
woman and that he had lied to me

  after he left i went to work and when
- had  saved enough money to pay the
fare i went to him the minute i saw
him i knew that something was wrong
he said that as long as we couldnt have
a home of our own we might as well stop
at a hotel but i didnt like that

  i found work rented a furnished room-
and tried to take care of myself he still
lived with me as my husband one night i
happened to find a letter he hadevidently
dropped it was from this second woman
and since ive read it i have been miser-
able	-

  then my husband told me the whole
story said that he loved her and that the
sooner he could get his freedom the better

  my husband lost his job on her account
she went back to her own home state but
corresponded with my husband i have
some of her letters i thought i would
keep them as they might prove good evi-
dence when i sued for divorce but i
couldnt make up my mind what to do i
wanted my baby to have a father

  however my husband became friendly
withanother woman and went away with
her by this time iknew i couldnt keep 
my job very long so the law brought him
back and put him in jail

  he promised to look after me and begged
me to drop the charges against him i
finally gave in he said he still loved me
and was sorry about the past he seemed
so heartbroken over the whole thing that
i thought he was sincere we left town 
and lived on some of the money i had
saved up for my hospital bills

  we now have two children but i feel
as if id rather do anything than stay with
my husband life is so hard and mar-
riage doesnt seem at all worth while my
husband is good to me and as far as i
know he hasnt tried to go with other
women he swears that what happened
will never happen again but i just cant
believe him can i do anything to make
my life happier	mbs v c b

  it is a tragedy that marriage
which begins with every promise of
the friend in need



success and happiness should so
often become a sorry mix-up but
althoughlife is hard and marriage
may sometimes seem not at all
worth while it is our job to show
at least a little courage and where
there are children a special effort
is required

  hard as it is and sometimes im-
possible to rebuild broken trust no
marriage can last without patience
common sense and self-sacrifice
sacrifices made for those we love are
never in vain and sooner or later
in one way or another loyalty and
devotion begin to pay dividends

  so keep your chin up my dear
evidently your husband means to
make good his promises a little
encouragement on your part wiu
perhaps make the relationship still
more agreeable try to forget the
past it will not be easy i know
but you can make the future so
much brighter not only for the chil-
dren and your husband but for
yourself too good luck

  dear mrs brown four years ago i
met a man fifteen years my -senior  i was
eighteen then he is very good-looking
and his folksare well-educated people bob
makes a fine salary but money seems to
mean little to him because he is the type
of man who would give his last cent away
to friends if they needed his help

  bob drinks and gambles but i dont
really object to this because he -never
drinks to excess

  when we first met i didnt know much
about him but after going with him for
three or four months i found out that he
also dated another girl but it was too
late for me i was already deeply in love
with him

  bob and i have been everything to each
other he tells me that he could never
forget me i know he thinks a lot of me
and would do anything i asked him

  when my father died a short time ago
bob attended to most of the details and
he is always around whenever i need him
however he cannot seem to forget this
other girl

  i know she doesnt love him because the

only time she dates him is when she knows
he can spend a lot of money he takes
her anywhere she wants to go this girl
is teaching school and is supporting her
parents and a brother another thing is
that if she ever marries she can never be
a mother - and bob loves children

  bob knows i love him so much i would
do anything in the world for him the
difference in our ages does not matter be-
cause whenever i have been out with boys
near my own age they seemed silly

  bob is very proud that i love him as
much as i do even though others may say
i love him not wisely but too well he
isnt the type that would talk about a
girl he is very popular but doesnt seem
to care whether he ever gets married or not

  i wish i knew what to do to make him
think of marriage wont you please ad-
vise me		dotty

 to use an old axiom you can
lead a horse to water but you cant
make him drink im afraiddear
that if your friend has felt no re-
sponsibility to marry you so far it
is very doubtful if he ever will it is
sad but true that in most cases of
this kind the girl is left-holding the
bag while the man transfers his
interest to some one else

  my most sincere advice to you
dotty is to drop this man at once
and give yourself time to forget the
entire incident it will not be easy
at first but later on when you meet
a man who will really deserve your
love you will be glad that you made
a break

  real love never thrives on things
that must be hidden from the rest
of the world real love is open and
aboveboard and is always altar-
bound

  dear mrs brown i married at the
age of sixteen after going steady for three
years for four years we were very happy
but my husband was in the habit of go-
ing out about twice a week he said he
had to go to club meetings or out with
the boys and i didnt object

  then my mother died and about four
weeks later a girl friend told me that she
saw my husband at a dance with another
girl i asked him and he denied it


street  smiths love story magazine

   i told my friend about it and she said
 she had known for a long time that my
 husband was dating different women but
 she just couldnt tell me because iwas so
 wrapped up in him as it often happens
 by the time- the wife finds out anything
 every one else knows all about it

   he was always good to me and never
 objected to getting me anything i wanted
 one-nighti caught him-talking to a girl on
 the street- he had told me earlier in the
 evening that he had to work that night

  then niy husband left town and didnt
  veil mfe where he was going this girl left
 the same day although she came back in a
 week my- husband stayed away for al-
  most three weeks then i received a let-
 ter from him in which he said that he
 still loved me and would send for me as
 lie was thinking of staying inthat town

   i didnt answer his letter and when he
 came back i made up with him for the

 	babys sake and because i still loved him
 with all-ray- heart i think its too bad
 that some of us cant help loving a man-
  when we know he isnt worthy of our love

   my husband still goes out on the aver-
 age of two nights a week but i dont be-
 lieve the excuses he offers i cant seem
 to trust him any more girls sometimes
 call him up right here at home and when
 he happens to be home the minute he hears
 the girls voice he hangs up and tells me
 there was no one on the line

   do you think i should break with my
 husband we have lived with my father
 ever since i was married and i really would
 have no place to go i have no brothers or
 sisters and have never worked

   although my father and my husband get
 along fairly well my father wants me to
 leave my husband he says he will take
 care of me and the baby he is grieving
 over mothers death and i wont have any
 one if he ever goes he tries to comfort
 me by saying that if anything ever hap-

 pens to him there will be enough left to
 take care of the baby and me

  maybe all this sounds foolish mrs
brown but i just had to write and ask
your opinion and tell me what you think
would be best for me to do im really un-
decided about leaving my husband i sup-
pose i feel this way because i still care

mary de l

  but dont you think my dear
that it wouldnt be quite fair to
saddle your father with the problem
of taking care of you and the baby
when that is your husbands job

  it is heartbreaking of course
when a husband disregards his wifes
love and devotion but it would
not ease your heartache if you were-
to break with your husband if you
love him as you say you do

   it mighthelp if you tried to reach
a better understanding  with him
his actions in the past were not at
all commendable of course how-
ever if you appeared to trust him
it might have a favorable effect and
in time you two could again find a
satisfactory degree of happiness to-
gether	 -

  you know mary there is some-
thing in the old saying nothing
ventured nothing gained try to
make yourself more attractive and
interesting and a little mysterious
it will be more effective than show-
ing openly how hurt you are and
how hard it is for you to believe in
him
